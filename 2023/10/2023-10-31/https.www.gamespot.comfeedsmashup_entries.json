It's not often that you get so many months of high-profile and critically acclaimed releases, but so far, this year has delivered a seemingly endless line of AAA blockbusters and smaller games with impressive ideas at their cores. While there's still some time before 2023 draws to a close, we're taking a look at the games that got a review score of 8 (which <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/review-guidelines/\">we deem \"great\"</a>) or higher on GameSpot so far this year.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">That's not to say that the games that scored below that threshold (or that we didn't review) aren't worthy of playing.
