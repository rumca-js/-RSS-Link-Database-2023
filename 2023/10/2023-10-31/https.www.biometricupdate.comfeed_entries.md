		NemID, Denmark's national digital ID system, will stop working tonight at midnight, completing the nation's shift to the more secure MitID system.

The Agency for Digital Government notes that 98 percent of its citizens over the age of 15 have already migrated to the new MitID system, which was <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202309/denmarks-digital-id-soon-to-be-valid-in-neighboring-countries">first introduced at the end of 2021</a>. Only 31,149 have been active on the outgoing NemID system within the past six months, and only 11,493 were active in October up to the 15th.

Most of those users are either over the age of 80 or have recently turned 15. Those experiencing homelessness also may have not made the shift.

“For the elderly, it may be that they have felt safe

		A rather significant legal oversight means that hundreds of millions of ID document and biometrics checks processed through the government of Australia’s identity verification services may have been conducted illegally, according to an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/oct/31/hundreds-of-millions-of-australian-identity-checks-may-have-been-illegally-conducted-senate-hears" rel="noopener" target="_blank">article</a> in the Guardian.

		Biometric identity verification providers Onfido, iDenfy, and Shufti Pro have all announced partnerships that will bring identity verification to secure and streamline onboarding for job boards, public parking services, and lifecycle management providers.

Automated ID verification provider <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/onfido">Onfido</a> is partnering with <a href="https://www.jobandtalent.com/">Job&amp;Talent</a>, a Spain-based job marketplace for essential work, to automate remote biometric identity verification for candidate onboarding.

		The Norwegian digital identity firm <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/signicat">Signicat</a> has signed on with ISTEC, a Spanish company that provides electronic trust services for private and government entities, to launch a service that lets individuals request a qualified digital certificate through video identification.

A release says that the service is the first of its kind, and allows Spanish citizens or foreigners with a valid TIE identity card living throughout Europe to apply for a digital certificate via personal computer or a mobile device. The certificates are valid for three years. This eliminates the previously mandatory in-person trip to apply for a digital ID certificate.

Signicat will provide identity verification via video face b

		Berlin-based digital ID wallet provider <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/verimi">Verimi</a> is touting its fully digital vehicle registration system, which issues a provisional digital registration certificate that enables driving while physical stickers and seals are processed. But a major stakeholder is making noise about divesting, according to a brief report in the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/478adb1b-e96c-4c6e-b5a1-7fb1f633fb0c">Financial Times</a>.

In a release posted to its blog, Verimi says it provides simple online identification and digital signing for internet-based vehicle registration for major customers of Germany’s Federal Motor Transport Authority (<a href="https://www.kba.de/EN/Home/home_node.html">Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt</a>, or KBA).

		Time usually narrows the choices and possible outcomes that come with an important information technology, but that decidedly is not the case with facial recognition.

Even governments of the developed economies appear no more sure-footed with how best to use and manage the AI algorithms than they were five years ago. (If it's better in the private sector it's because most businesses deploying them have boldly decided just to wing it.)

A legislative effort in the United States to <a href="https://lieu.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/reps-lieu-jackson-lee-clarke-gomez-ivey-and-veasey-introduce-bill">put "strong limits</a>" on the use of facial recognition by law enforcement agencies is almost certainly doomed and years behind similar state laws th

		In Nepal, Migrant Resource Centres (MRCs) are located outside of passport offices to serve applicants before they move on to submit their biometrics for their passports. The centers are part of the <a href="https://www.sami.org.np/">Safer Migration Project</a> (SaMi), a joint initiative between the Swiss and Nepalese government. Now, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), co-funder of the centers, is moving on to serve the initiative in an advisory capacity, leaving critics concerned that the program won't survive solely under Nepalese government leadership, according to a <a href="https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/business/swiss-help-for-nepalese-migrant-workers-is-at-a-crossroads/48905804">Swiss Info article</a>.

		Facial recognition tool ASTR, developed by the Center for the Development of Telematics (C-DoT) of India’s Department of Telecommunications, has been vital in the identification and disconnection of over six million untrusted SIM card connections this year.

According to <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/india-disconnects-6-4-million-fraudulent-phone-connections-with-the-help-of-facial-recognition-11622281.html">Money Control</a>, these disconnections have been carried out over the past six months.

This is not the first time India is breaking up fraudulent SIM connections using the facial recognition system. In May, about <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202305/facial-recognition-helps-indian-authorities-identify-sim-fraudsters">17,000

		<em>By Steve Povolny, director, security research, </em><a href="https://exabeam.com/"><em>Exabeam</em></a>

When it comes to cybersecurity, organizations tend to overcomplicate their cyber defense strategies. Instead of sorting through the complexities of your organization’s digital landscape, start with the basic foundation of cybersecurity: protecting login credentials.

October is recognized as National Cybersecurity Awareness Month, an annual campaign that strives to educate businesses and individuals about the importance of protecting digital assets through cyber safety measures. Each year, this month serves as an opportunity for organizations to reaffirm their commitment to safeguarding sensitive data and proactively prevent cyberattacks.

		The Australian federal government continues to struggle with digital IDs that make it easy for First Nations people to access services that others take for granted.

An <a href="https://www.innovationaus.com/leave-no-one-behind-the-urgent-need-for-inclusive-digital-id/">article</a> and<a href="https://www.innovationaus.com/podcasts/identity-matters-ep5-human-inclusion-in-digital-identity-design/"> video program</a> published by news and analysis publication InnovationAus.com points out that the government has made strides in including First Nations Australians in digital identity programs.

		The U.S. city of San Francisco's reputation as a permissive haven of peaceably stoned jaywalkers takes some hits periodically, but what its mayor is proposing for biometric surveillance may be a full-speed tackle.

Mayor London Breed has put a measure on the next ballot that would significantly deregulate <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202209/san-francisco-cops-a-step-closer-to-formalized-access-to-private-surveillance-camera-feeds">police use of face biometrics</a> including the platforms where cameras can be bolted.

Breed might be making San Francisco the least rule-bound U.S. municipality that still has rules about surveillance.
