Hence The Postmodernist Drinking Song. </p>\n<p>The Postmodernist Drinking Song is based on an old English folk song, The Ballad of Lydia Pinkham, by way of a 1960\u2019s British pop group, the Scaffold, whose variant Lily the Pink reached number one in the UK singles chart in \u201968 (https://shorturl.at/btRZ).
