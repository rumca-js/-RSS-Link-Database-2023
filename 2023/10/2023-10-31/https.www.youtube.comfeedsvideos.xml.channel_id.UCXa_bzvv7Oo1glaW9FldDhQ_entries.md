In a generation of platformers, DON'T NOD has delivered a 3D platformer that is simply put excellent. Jusant takes place in a future where the world's water has seemingly dried up, and the player must surmount a tower to learn about its missing inhabitants.

This is done by scaling up cliff faces, breathing life into plants with the mysterious Ballast and either grappling or rappelling across gaps. Unlike climbing titles like Bennett Foddy's Getting Over It or Only Up!, Jusant is more adventure-focused, offering several forgiving ways to scale the tower without grieving over every fall.

It's also no slouch in the story department, mixing mystery with a relaxing atmosphere to create a compelling experience. Find out why Jusant is worth checking out before its release on Xbox Series X/S, PS5 and PC.
