<p>Researchers in UK say new tool could help ensure patients at high risk are identified promptly</p><p>Artificial intelligence is almost twice as accurate as a biopsy at judging the aggressiveness of some cancers, according to research that experts say could save the lives of thousands of patients.</p><p>Cancer kills 10 million people globally every year, according to the World Health Organization. For millions more patients, the disease can be thwarted if detected promptly and dealt with quickly. A key challenge for health workers is to find patients with high-risk tumours and treat them early.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/oct/31/ai-better-than-biopsy-at-assessing-some-cancers-study-finds">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Wyndham’s theatre, London<br /></strong>At two hours with no interval, the actor-director’s production hurtles past at such speed that the depths of the play are too rarely realised</p><p>Kenneth Branagh has confirmed his mercurial ability to inhabit Shakespeare’s flawed heroes over decades on stage and film. We have come to expect great things: energy, polish and accomplished verse diction.</p><p>That is what we get here, in his production of what some believe to be the most tragic of Shakespearean downfalls. But although Branagh delivers his Lear with slick, almost playful efficiency, it is not his towering achievement.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/oct/31/king-lear-review-kenneth-branagh-shakespeare-tragedy-wyndhams-theatre-london">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Theatre Royal, Bath<br /></strong>An excellent cast give the story of Ruth Snyder, a woman executed by electric chair in 1928 for killing her husband, a cleverly inventive, chillingly modern update</p><p>Ruth Snyder’s crime was sensationalised in its day and well after it. An American who murdered her husband and paid with her life, her very public death in 1928 by electric chair has served as gruesome inspiration for, among others, Billy Wilder and Guns N’ Roses. Sophie Treadwell’s 1928 play infuses Snyder’s story with compassion and tragedy, without a hint of sentimentality.</p><p>This stark, magnetic revival draws on the play’s expressionist roots yet also renders it chillingly modern in showing how female criminality is still often depicted. Immaculately directed by Richard Jones, it is spare yet shocking.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/oct/31/machinal-review-theatre-royal-bath">Continue reading...</a>

I can’t remember the last time something felt real (including reality), but Banged Up strikes out against the tide. I suspect the makers would prefer their series in which celebrities do a week in the decommissioned HMP Shrewsbury with former inmates – instructed to behave exactly as they would have done while serving their sentences – to be referred to as a social experiment. But it is a reality show, albeit one with far less fake tan, no expensive breasts or dental work and with an air of genuine violence hanging over the whole.</p><p>The opening episode introduces three of the seven celebrities who have volunteered for this odd experience.

Now, not even a year later, we know the answer.</p><p>Saudi Arabia will host the Fifa men’s World Cup in 2034. Only the most unexpected or disastrous of circumstances will change that. Saudi Arabia, officially, has only ‘expressed an interest’ in being host to the 48-team tournament, but it stands in a field of one. It has the endorsement of the Asian Football Confederation and more than 100 Fifa member nations. Not insignificantly, it is also the apple of Gianni Infantino’s eye.

<p><strong>Sadler’s Wells, London<br /></strong>A loose, casual dance based on an artist’s interpretation of a Cézanne painting via a Pete Harden score is full of ideas that often feel out of sync </p><p>You could watch French choreographer Maud Le Pladec’s show and easily miss a key fact: the 10 performers on stage are not always listening to the same music we are.<br /><br />The score for the work is by British composer Pete Harden, based on Schubert’s unfinished Symphony No 8. It’s as if that piece of music has been put through a mincer, coming out a bit fudgey, a bit stringy; one note stuck in a drone followed by surges of melody.<br /><br />But for the first movement, the dancers, wearing earpieces, are only hearing a “blueprint” based on the symphony’s opening motif, what Harden calls “the DNA” of the music. Sometimes the audience hears the same, sometimes we don’t. The effect it has on our experience of the dance is not exactly clear.</p><p>The idea for this piece comes from S

<p>With Skims’ eye-catching ‘erect nipple bra’, you can now look more naked than you would naked</p><p>The new bra in Kim Kardashian’s lingerie range, with its “daring” raised nipple detail, goes on sale on Halloween, but not, I think, because the effect she’s going for is “scary”. The sales pitch is “No matter how hot it is, you will always look cold”, but I’m not sure “cold” is the look she’s really after, either; the word “perky” has also been floated. Kim is offering you the chance to look permanently turned on, by everything. You could be ambling along with nothing on your mind but a knotty Wordle and half a to-do list, and thanks to the Skims perky bra, sprinkle random erotic charge all over everything. Would this make your day better, or worse? Hard to say, but definitely different.</p><p>I resisted Kardashian discourse all the way through the butt years, as I felt that people were loading her with beliefs and agendas she hadn’t necessarily signed up to.

Writer-director Michael Wright clearly has a yen for this milieu and takes care to get the argot right in this tale of Arthur Morel (Paul McGann), a reticent funeral director who gets mixed up with local hoodlum Finlay (Roger Barclay) in a northern town. Finlay needs a bit of help burying the excess bodies his shady business generates, or “loose ends” as he describes them.</p><p>It’s not immediately clear why Arthur agrees to take on this shady extra business, but perhaps it has something to do with his late brother who had a gambling habit that got hi

<p>With these clear, crisp portraits of the economists who shaped her worldview, the shadow chancellor has set out a powerful statement of who she is and what she wants to achieve</p><p>Rachel Reeves certainly knows her mind. She is also, as the title of this original book suggests, a passionate and convinced feminist. Any number of great female economists from across the political spectrum helped create the discipline she loves. They suffered misogyny, sexism and prejudice – to an extent that sometimes made this male reader squirm – yet they won through. Their contribution is too little recognised and acknowledged. Reeves is determined to right that wrong and does so persuasively.</p><p>But this book has a double interest. It is written by Britain’s chancellor-in-waiting, who if elected would be the first woman in the job – as she reminds us. She not only offers a personal and intellectual portrait of a succession of intriguing and sometimes forgotten female economists, she delivers

<p>In gaming as in cinema, all of the most personal, creative and risk-taking horror can be found away from the mainstream. And happily it’s also a genre in which budget constraints can be turned into an advantage</p><p>Leaf through the history of independent video games and the pages are drenched in horror. It was there in the 1990s shareware era of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/13/doom-video-gaming-ramones">Doom</a> and Hugo’s House of Horrors. It was there too in the Flash games of the early 2000s: Exmortis, the House series, the now lost Hotel 626. And it is here now, in the modern indie age. Lone coders and small development studios have always explored dark stories in haunted houses, lonely forests and seemingly abandoned spacecraft populated by demonic entities. Some of the greatest ever horror games are indies: Amnesia: Dark Descent, Devotion, Slender, Iron Lung. And of course there’s Five Nights at Freddy’s, one of the most successful indie games o

<p>A micro-budget and scrappy energy add charm to this quirky sci-fi tale in which unremarkable people watch over their charges</p><p>Peter (Scott Haran) is a former child chess prodigy who these days excels at nothing much in particular, except perhaps his ability to blend into the background. A birthday card at his office is handed to him to sign – for his own birthday. None of his colleagues know who he is, and the card is crammed with polite, anodyne messages. But he discovers that there’s one arena in which his anonymity might be a boon rather than a liability: he is recruited into the world of Bystanding, a parallel universe filled with invisible guardian types whose job is to imperceptibly guide or nudge their charges into making better life choices. They are all, in their own ways, as unremarkable as Peter, hence their selection for bystander duty.</p><p>There’s a scrappy energy to this British sci-fi comedy that offsets its micro-budget limitations.

<p>For Halloween, Guardian writers look back at their biggest movie nightmares, from The Omen to It Follows</p><ul><li><strong>There are major spoilers ahead</strong></li></ul><p>Dario Argento’s equally gorgeous and grotesque Suspiria is here to cure anybody of their scary-movie snobbery. In this masterpiece, Suzy Bannion (Jessica Harper) is a graceful and wide-eyed American who shows up at the Tanz Academy, an elite ballet school in the shadows of the Black Forest. Whoever dreamed up this august institution, with its sumptuous art nouveau decor and gaudily vivid hues, may as well have written the Wes Anderson playbook. Young women float by in gauzy get-ups and then, one by one, they disappear. The creepy-crawly atmosphere has Suzy on edge from the jump – and interludes with a Dr Feelgood and a case of maggots falling from the ceiling do little to calm her nerves. In the film’s thrilling climax, a terrified Suzy works her way down a secret corridor and finds the building’s inner sanc
