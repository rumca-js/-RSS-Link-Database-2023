If your boss stomps and yells, criticizes you, and then proceeds to take the credit for your work—even it is an isolated incident—it can take a profound toll on employee well-being and performance. But despite the many years of research, the precise mechanisms through which bad leadership impacts employees' performance remain a subject of interest.

For decades, scientists have long sought to mimic these marvels in artificial systems, but have fallen far short of matching the exquisite ion discrimination of natural protein channels. Typically, the K+/Na+ selectivity ratio of existing artificial potassium channels is less than 40-fold.

However, the basal immune responses typically only slow down the colonization of pathogens, ultimately leading to significant global losses in plant production caused by fungi, oomycetes, bacteria, insects, and nematodes.

In soft reservoirs, the concentration of salt is not high, and in hypersaline water the percentage of salt is 40% and higher. Hypersalinity is characteristic of salt lakes and bays where fresh water evaporates faster than new water manages to replenish.

Most Americans believe political discourse has grown coarser in recent years, as old taboos against publicly cursing and attacking an opponent's family have fallen away. Politicians and their supporters call critics and opponents "criminals" or "fascists," while some 2024 presidential candidates muse about executing the nation's top military adviser or pledge to "slit the throats" of a bloated public workforce. Many worry the way we talk about politics is dangerously incendiary.

Historians and archaeologists have, over centuries, explored the mysteries behind the Great Sphinx of Giza: What did it originally look like? What was it designed to represent? What was its original name? But less attention has been paid to a foundational, and controversial, question: What was the terrain the Ancient Egyptians came across when they began to build this instantly recognizable structure—and did these natural surroundings have a hand in its formation?
