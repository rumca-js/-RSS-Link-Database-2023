<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I'm a prison guard in a Scandinavian prison workshop. </p> <p>Looking to upgrade the old FlashForge Finder to something more up to date, with a price tag at around $600-1000. </p> <p>Been looking at the Bambu Lab P1S and it ticks of pretty much everything we need and seems like a great machine, but..</p> <p>We need a machine that works completely offline. No internet, no LAN WiFi. From what I can understand that makes the P1S a bad choice, right?</p> <p>What other machines might be suitable? </p> <p>It will be used for learning, as sort of a steping stone on the way to become a CNC operator, so the more intuitive the software the better. We use Fusion360 for the CNC mostly. </p> <p>A big plus is also if its fully enclosed since it will be operating in a wood shop environment with a lot of saw dust in the air. </p> <p>All tips are greatly appreciated. I'm a complete noob when it comes to 3D printing fyi so go easy on me lol.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &
