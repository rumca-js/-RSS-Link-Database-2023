And that their pathetic attempts to "All Lives Matter" the October 7th Hamas terrorist attack is affecting the party in a negative fashion. Now in order to convince voters they don't hate the Jews as much as their words and actions say they do, some of them are admitting that antisemitism is a bad thing.
