Jews were <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SethAMandel/status/1717686427838750934\" target=\"_blank\">told to stay home last weekend in NYC</a> because their government can't guarantee their safety. And Karine Jean-Pierre doesn't think the President of the United States needs to speak out about it because he was vocal about Charlottesville... in 2017.</p><p>We shouldn't be surprised. This is the same White House (remember, KJP speaks for the entire White House) that claimed they <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jean-pierre-biden-antisemitism\" target=\"_blank\">hadn't seen much antisemitism</a>, but <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-islamop", "link": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/karine-jean-pierre-pro-hamas", "date_published": "2023-10-31T12:17:46+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "Louder With Crowder", "album": "Louder With Crowder", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzE1NTQ3MS9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MjE1Njc1MH0.cVUGcJzdyyjj3xKR7tPeQKtnP3_3j0yJ-3yt3wA91m8/image.png?width=210", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0}, {"source": "http://louderwithcrowder.com/feed/", "title": "Enjoy watching someone get knocked out with a 2-liter bottle of soda in funniest shoplifting fail you'll see this week", "description": "<img src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=50337984&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0\" /><br /><br /><p>It's the little things in life. King-sized Reese's Fast Break bars. Loading up a red wagon with High Noon's so grown-ups have something to do while their kids take over the neighborhood. AND, watching some shoplifting little punk getting knocked the f*ck out with a perfectly thrown 2-liter bottle of Diet Dr. Pepper. There is so much suck in the news this week. Let's all enjoy this together.</p><p>As with most videos, we don't know where this takes place. We'll call it somewhere in America. It could even be in real America, as opposed to a progressive-run city. It's not that shoplifting doesn't exist in rural areas or the suburbs. It's just not encouraged like it is in <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/eric-adams-destroy-new-york-city\" target=\"_blank\">New York City</a> and <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/san-f", "link": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/shoplifter-knocked-out-with-coke", "date_published": "2023-10-31T11:14:34+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "Louder With Crowder", "album": "Louder With Crowder", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMzE1NTQ3MS9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MjE1Njc1MH0.cVUGcJzdyyjj3xKR7tPeQKtnP3_3j0yJ-3yt3wA91m8/image.png?width=210", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0}]
