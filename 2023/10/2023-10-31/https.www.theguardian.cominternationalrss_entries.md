<p>She rose to fame posting forlornly as @SoSadToday. Can her latest novel – inspired by the death of her father, who returns inside a cactus – really be wackier than her merman love story The Pisces? And why does she now prefer Reddit to X?</p><p>Melissa Broder describes her third novel, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/oct/26/death-valley-by-melissa-broder-review-surreality-bites">Death Valley</a>, as “a send-up of autofiction”. Its opening section sticks loosely to Broder’s life: an unnamed LA-based novelist drives out into the desert on a research trip for her new book. Her father is in an intensive care unit, just as Broder’s was while she was writing Death Valley. Her husband has a mysterious chronic illness, just as Broder’s does. But about 40 pages in, things take a turn for the surreal. While on a hike, the protagonist encounters a giant cactus. And inside the cactus she meets her father in child form.</p><p>So begins a witty, psychedelic exploration of grief

Just as James Gandolfini can be remembered as a great dramatic actor on the strength of Tony Soprano alone, the brilliance of Perry – who died this week aged 54 – is all there in Chandler. Perry understood how to make the funny lines funnier and the so-so lines funny enough, doing his job so well that he created a particular sense of humour that spread way beyond the show itself. It’s just obvious when someone you know is a Chandler, or when you make a Chandler joke yourself: such definitive TV roles are exceptionally rare.</p><p>The cast of Friends have, understandably, struggled to match their biggest success, perhaps because for the

<p>Our panel of cakey experts say oil, acidity and a slight underbake are all factors in attaining that optimum squish</p><p><strong>How do I achieve a rich, moist, fluffy chocolate cake that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6OCeOU2eyI">Bruce Bogtrotter in Matilda</a> would be proud of?<br /></strong><em><strong>Katie, London N17<br /></strong></em>“The key to most fluffy cakes is the addition of oil,” says Phil Khoury, author of <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/a-new-way-to-bake-9781784885922">A New Way to Bake</a>. That could come, he says, via replacing “up to 50%” of the butter in a recipe with neutral oil or substituting it entirely, the reason being that “oils are liquid at both fridge and room temperatures, whereas butter has to go above 25C for it to take on the attributes you associate with a moist cake”. Also, as butter starts to solidify, it has a drying effect on cakes, so having some oil in there will help soften things, Khoury adds.</p><p>There is, of cour

<p>As Israel steps up its military campaign in Gaza, residents trapped in the territory are facing a humanitarian crisis</p><p>Israel has begun a new phase in its war on Hamas as its armed forces move deeper into Gaza amid a continuous bombardment from the air. In a televised press conference on Saturday, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said: “We have unanimously approved the widening of the ground invasion … Our objective is singular: to defeat the murderous enemy. We declared ‘never again’, and we reiterate: ‘never again, now’.”</p><p>In Gaza, where communications have been all but impossible in recent days, the reporter <strong>Hazem Balousha </strong>tells <strong>Michael Safi </strong>that the intensifying assault is making everywhere in Gaza unsafe.

Demanding offsets for meeting core national security needs of the United States – like supporting Israel and defending Ukraine from atrocities and Russian imperialism – would be a break with the normal, bipartisan process and could have devastating implications for our safety and alliances in the years ahead,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said.</p><p><s
