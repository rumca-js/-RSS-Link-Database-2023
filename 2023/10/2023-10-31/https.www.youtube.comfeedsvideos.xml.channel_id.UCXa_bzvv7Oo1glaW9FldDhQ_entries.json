Jusant takes place in a future where the world's water has seemingly dried up, and the player must surmount a tower to learn about its missing inhabitants.\n\nThis is done by scaling up cliff faces, breathing life into plants with the mysterious Ballast and either grappling or rappelling across gaps. Unlike climbing titles like Bennett Foddy's Getting Over It or Only Up!, Jusant is more adventure-focused, offering several forgiving ways to scale the tower without grieving over every fall.\n\nIt's also no slouch in the story department, mixing mystery with a relaxing atmosphere to create a compelling experience. Find out why Jusant is worth checking out before its release on Xbox Series X/S, PS5 and PC.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UQRqfC9zCw", "date_published": "2023-10-31T20:30:01+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/5UQRqfC9zCw/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "10 BRAND NEW Games of November 2023 To Look Forward To [PS5, Xbox Series X | S, PC]", "description": "2023 is nearly over, and in terms of video games, it's hard to argue with the sheer quality of releases throughout. You would think that the pace of releases would slow heading into November, but there's still a surprising amount of titles to look forward to.\n\nFrom the slow-burn sci-fi thriller that is Starward Industries' The Invincible to realistic rally racing with EA Sports WRC, there are several compelling titles to choose from. Even smaller, lesser-known releases like Broken Roads and Flashback 2 should be on your radar.\n\nCheck out some of the biggest games launching in November 2023 and what makes them so appealing.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLOSvhbgpo4", "date_published": "2023-10-31T18:00:13+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/XLOSvhbgpo4/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "RoboCop: Rogue City Review - The Final Verdict", "description": "Robocop: Rogue City is the next sci-fi action media to receive the video game treatment from developer Teyon.
