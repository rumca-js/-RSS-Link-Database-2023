Amythyst Kiah is a singer-songwriter from Chattanooga, Tenn., who is one of the biggest up-and-coming artists in Americana music today. The release of her 2021 album, "Wary + Strange" (on @rounderrecords), advanced her solo career after Kiah first gained recognition as part of Our Native Daughters, a supergroup comprising Kiah, Rhiannon Giddens, Leyla McCalla and Allison Russell, whose live performance of Kiah’s song, “Black Myself,” at the 2019 Americana Honors and Awards ceremony in Nashville remains unforgettable to all who saw the performance in person or on video.

Here, Kiah discusses her amazing journey of music discovery and the many influences along the way.
