Godzilla has been king of the monsters since he first toppled Tokyo and the world’s most famous kaiju is showing no signs of slowing down. But it hasn’t been a straight shot for the iconic monster. Let’s go all the way back to the beginning to look at the origins of Godzilla.

While Toho originally portrayed the iconic kaiju as a destructive force, they quickly pivoted Gojira into a more sympathetic figure, even a savior of mankind as he began famous battles with Ghidora, Mothra, Rodan and even King Kong. From the Showa era, to Heisei, to Legendary and beyond, here is how Godzilla changed from a destructive force to the savior of humanity.
