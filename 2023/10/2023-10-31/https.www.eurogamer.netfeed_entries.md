Rollerdrome, the acclaimed (and ridiculously stylish) skater shooter from OlliOlli developer Roll7, is launching for Xbox Series X/S and Game Pass on 28th November.
</p><p>
Rollerdrome, which debuted on PC and PlayStation toward the end of last year, is set in the far-flung future of seven years from now, where, in a world ruled by corporations, the public is kept placated by a brutal blood sport known, as, yes, Rollerdrome.
</p><p>
Thrust into this dystopian set-up, players, in the role of Kara Hasson, don rollerskates and raise weapons - specifically, dual pistols, a grenade launcher, shotgun, and eventually, a laser-crossbow - for some high-speed third-person shooting action, where performing tricks restores ammo and bullet-time-style slo-mo can be deployed for greater success against opponents.

Yesterday's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-developer-bungie-latest-playstation-studio-to-be-hit-by-layoffs">layoffs at Destiny 2 developer Bungie</a> reportedly impacted 100 employees - approximately 8% of its 1,200-strong workforce - and occurred just weeks after management warned staff that revenue for the year was running significantly below expectations.
</p><p>
That's <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-31/sony-s-bungie-game-unit-cut-jobs-as-destiny-2-popularity-waned">according to Bloomberg</a>, which reports Bungie employees were issued "dire management warnings" that revenue was 45 percent below projections just two weeks ago. The slump is said to be the result of a "sharp drop" in the popularity of Destiny 2, with Bungie CEO Pete Parsons having reportedly highlighted weak player rete

Atari has entered into an agreement to acquire Digital Eclipse, the retro-focused studio behind the likes of Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration and this year's The Making of Karateka.
</p><p>
Digital Eclipse has had quite an eventful existence since its founding in 1992. In its original guise, it specialised in porting arcade games over to the likes of Game Boy Colour and PlayStation; that emulation work has continued over the years, first as it become Backbone Entertainment following a merger in 2003, and again after the Digital Eclipse brand was purchased and revived by former employees in 2015.
</p><p>
In recent years, the studio's emulation work has included the Blizzard Arcade Collection, Street Fighter: 30th Anniversary, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection, but last year's interactive digi

## Alan Wake 2 on Xbox Series X improves on PS5 performance

Alan Wake 2 is one of the best-looking video games ever made. With beautiful lighting and intricate asset detail, it's a bit of a technical showcase, especially on PC with path tracing enabled. The PS5 release also looks brilliant, as I covered last week, with the similar visuals bereft of some path-tracing niceties and with some image quality issues. However, I didn't spend a huge amount of time looking at the differences between quality and performance modes. Meanwhile, review code for Xbox Series machines didn't arrive until launch, which raises a couple of key questions: does Series X match or improve upon PS5? Does Xbox Series S have the power to deliver a decent Alan Wake 2 experience?
</p><p>
On PS5 and Series X, Alan Wake offers a quality mode and a performance mode, which target 30 and 60 frames per second respectively. Remedy ha

## Jusant review - soaring design and skyscraping climbs

Oh yes. It was the bit in the movie where you leap from one spar of a broken bridge to another, and try to avoid thinking of the drop beneath you. I buckled up. I checked the carabiner. I decided to trust the line. I leapt. I swung on the rope. And then--
</p><p>
Now. I could have swung across the gap and connected with the other part of the bridge. No problem. In the bold sweep of difficult things that Jusant asks you to do while climbing, this was not actually that tricky - it just looked singularly dramatic. But there I was, suspended on a line above miles of buffeted nothingness, and I saw the bridge and its handholds and the safety and progress it represented. But from this angle I could also see something below me. A cleft in the rock. A lacuna, as my neurologist would say. A gap. And in that gap I glimpsed the outline of a tall buil

A new report from the Carbon Trust, a UK-founded global consultancy which aims to drive positive climate change in businesses, has outlined best practice for the games industry to calculate its carbon emissions.
</p><p>
The report, in support of the Playing for the Planet alliance, was conducted with 10 video game companies over 12 months to explore their approaches to carbon accounting. It found the majority of emissions are either in goods and services (such as data centres) or energy used by video game products.
</p><p>
In addition to the guidelines for the industry, the report also includes steps the public can take to reduce the carbon impact of playing.

Can you believe it, but yesterday marked 25 years since Grim Fandango first made its way into the world. Nope, nor can I!
</p><p>
To mark the ever marching hands of time, and I suppose the occasion, the team at Double Fine has shared some special fan creations including cosplays and artwork. 
</p><p>
"Our team got together with our community and made this amazing tribute filled with stories, art, and tattoos!" Grim Fandango's director Tim Schafer <a href="https://twitter.com/TimOfLegend/status/1719212135220425103">shared</a> on X (formerly Twitter). "Thank you to everyone who contributed and collected these beautiful memories! I'll keep them next to where my heart used to be."

Forthcoming team shooter The Finals has been criticised for using AI for its commentator voiceovers.

Developed by Embark Studios, comprising former DICE employees, it's currently in open beta - as announced at the recent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-featured-in-tonights-xbox-partner-preview-showcase">Xbox Partner Preview showcase</a>.

</p><p>
As part of its arena battle style, it includes voiceover from two commentators, but these have been developed with AI drawing criticism from voice actors and designers alike.

Cliff Bleszinski, the creator behind the Gears of War series, has suggested the games get a God of War-style reboot. Oh, and that Xbox just needs to give him a call.

Speaking with <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/cliff-bleszinski-scrapper-gears-of-war-interview/">Comic Book</a> about his upcoming comic Scrapper, conversation turned to the shooter series. Bleszinski said he could consult  on any ideas Microsoft may have for the series, and suggested it could get a "little bit of a reboot, like God of War" had in 2018. 
</p><p>
"I've always said, Phil Spencer has my number," he told the publication. "I'm happy to consult. Gears will always be near and dear to my heart."

## RoboCop: Rogue City review - double-A throwback too faithful for its own good

RoboCop: Rogue City would have been the absolute biz back in 2005. This might sound like a criticism, and to a certain extent it is. But I mean it equally as a compliment to developer Teyon's work. The studio's latest licensed FPS following Terminator: Resistance is a fine example of a AA game, with an ambition that exceeds its budget, and a sincerity that helps power through no small amount of wonk. It's a decent shooter, a surprisingly involved policing game, and an authentic RoboCop experience. But as with all Teyon's games it lacks refinement, while it adheres too closely to the themes and plot points of the films to truly flourish as its own tale.
</p><p>
Taking place between RoboCops 2 and 3, Rogue City kicks off with a glorious statement of intent. A gang of crazed punks named the Torch Heads takes over Det
