Bellevue, Wash.-based Atana has been known for its training solutions around diversity and inclusion, sexual harassment, bias, workplace violence, and more. A new product called Atana Insights combines that content with AI-driven behavioral insights and analytics, to help change attitudes and behaviors on those topics. &#8220;We seamlessly integrate behavioral theory, organizational psychology, and advanced data science to empower organizations to foster positive, lasting behavior change at scale,&#8221; Atana CEO John Hansen said.

But the region has another vast resource for trapping carbon that&#8217;s more easily overlooked: the basaltic rock formations covering swaths of Washington, Oregon and Idaho. Now a regional consortium is investigating whether the area could become a carbon capture hub, locking away planet warming CO2 in rocks or turning it into other compounds. The group, called the Ankeron Carbon Management Hub, has landed $3 million in funding from the U.S. Department of Energy to do a two-year study on the science, feasibility,&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2023/how-the-pacific-northwest-could-become-a-carbon-capture-hub-with-help-from-tech-and-basalt/\">Read More</a>", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2023/how-the-pacific-northwest-could-become-a-carbon-capture-hub-with-help-from-tech-and-basalt", "date_published": "2023-10-31T14:43:41+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GeekWire", "album": "GeekWire", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://www.geekwire.com/wp-content/themes/geekwire/dist/images/geekwire-logo-rss.png", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0}]
