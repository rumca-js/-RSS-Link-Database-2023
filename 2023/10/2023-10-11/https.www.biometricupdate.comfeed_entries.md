		Suffering from Portal-itis? A release says that New York-based <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/clear">Clear</a>, which works to provide frictionless digital ID and customer experiences, is forming a strategic partnership with the healthcare platform b.well Connected Health, in an attempt to move beyond identity verification processes that are more complicated than a double bypass surgery.

“Clear is on a mission to make experiences safer and easier,” says Caryn Seidman Becker, CEO of Clear, reflecting the firm’s broad vision for digital identity. “In healthcare, that means we're putting you in control of your medical information with a single sign-on account that you can access with the snap of a selfie – no forms, fax machines or multiple l

		As digital public infrastructure becomes the norm, governments must adopt digital services to improve access and development. The UNDP released a <a href="https://www.undp.org/digital/blog/governing-digital-legal-id-systems-effectively-ensure-inclusion-and-respect-human-rights-0">blog post</a> outlining a rights-based and inclusive digital ID governance framework in response to frequent requests for institutional support.

The goal of Target <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/sdg-16-9">16.9</a> of the Sustainable Development Goals and Agenda 2030 is to provide legal identity and birth registration for all, underscoring the importance of comprehensive <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/rwanda-seeks-contractor-to-digitize-civil-registration-archiving-system">civil re

		The Minister of Interior of Nigeria, Olubunmi Tunji-Ojo, has pledged that his ministry will dismantle all challenges that continue to stand in the way of efforts to set up a single biometric database and harmonized data that will link all government ministries, departments and agencies in the country.

Speaking early this week at the start of an international event organized by the University of Lagos, Tunji-Ojo said a harmonized data management system for the country will not only reduce cost and time, it will equally enhance integrity and trust especially in the issuance of identity credentials like passports, Vanguard <a href="https://www.vanguardngr.com/2023/10/we-will-break-jinx-of-non-harmonisation-of-database-in-nigeria-interior-minister/">reports</a>.

		A recent study published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-42841-4"><em>Scientific Reports</em></a> examines a new method of biometric verification called CompaRR, that records beat-to-beat information embedded in intervals between heartbeats.

While many forms of biometric verification involve stationary physiological signals like facial authentication and fingerprint scanning, non-stationary signals like heartbeats are more difficult to fake.

While <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202205/b-secur-updates-heartbeat-biometric-software-to-improve-accuracy-of-ecg">ECG (or “EKG”) recordings</a> have shown the capacity to verify identity through the heart's electrical activity, the method uses a complex system that usually requires a medical prof

		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/idology">IDology</a>, an ID verification provider and <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/gbg">GBG</a> company, announced in a release that it has expanded its portfolio of services for gambling providers to strengthen anti-fraud and AML efforts, while optimizing player acquisition and revenue and complying with state and federal regulations.

The portfolio now features age verification checks that the company says increase pass rates, particularly among hard-to-identify populations, while keeping out those who are underaged. Step-up verification automates in-line authentication of government IDs by implementing forensic and CVML tests and biometric verification through a selfie.

		Remote online notarization is not the topic the biometric ID community would expect to generate much heat in 2023, but it has.

RON is the process and rules involved with getting something notarized remotely. It saves time and money and has engendered little if any controversy <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202004/e-signature-demand-spikes-around-the-world-to-support-remote-transactions">over the years</a> it <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202203/selfie-biometrics-deployed-from-banking-to-auto-sales-legal-sector-urged-to-follow-suit">has been around</a>.

One primary aspect to remote notarization is identity proofing, and that aspect could be changing in a way that it could be less secure.

		A pair of news stories this month, one only tangentially related to personal privacy, again point out the stakes involved in the commercial use of biometric identifiers.

In the U.S. state of Illinois, home of the landmark Biometric Information <a href="https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=3004&amp;ChapterID=57">Privacy Act</a>, plaintiffs who feel their identifiers are being misused have found a second state biometric law.
