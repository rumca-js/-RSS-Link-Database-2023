We certainly count ourselves in that group, and here, we\u2019ll be talking about a few such questions.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1Zkz934thc", "date_published": "2023-10-11T13:30:28+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/l1Zkz934thc/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "NHL 24 Review - The Final Verdict", "description": "NHL 24 takes steps to put the intense feel and physicality of ice hockey right into the hands of players. New gameplay systems such as the Exhaust Engine add a fresh tactical dimension to proceedings, and with brutal body checks and skill moves now mappable to the controller\u2019s face buttons taking to the ice in NHL 24 is as exhilarating as ever. \n\nHowever, there are still certain game modes that demand a refresh at this point, and some of NHL 24\u2019s touted new innovations, such as Vision Passing, aren\u2019t new at all. The jury\u2019s out on whether some of these new systems are even required at all. Still, NHL 24 is a solid entry in EA Sports\u2019 ice hockey franchise, and worth diving in if you haven\u2019t played a recent NHL title.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbt43RY30hI", "date_published": "2023-10-11T11:00:46+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/wbt43RY30hI/hqdefault.jpg"}]
