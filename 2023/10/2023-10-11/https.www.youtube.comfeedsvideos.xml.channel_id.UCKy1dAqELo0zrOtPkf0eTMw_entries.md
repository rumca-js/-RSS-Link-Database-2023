Google is back again with the latest iteration in its Pixel line. The new Pixel 8 Pro is geared up to be the top dog and a challenger for ranking as the best smartphone on the market. It has big shoes to fill, as the Pixel 7 Pro was a smash hit and neither Samsung nor Apple have been sleeping on upgrading their flagship lines. By comparison, the Pixel 8 Pro actually feels like it may be a more relaxed update than Samsung’s Galaxy S23 Ultra or Apple’s iPhone 15 Pro Max, but Google’s phone also costs hundreds less, even at its year-on-year elevated price of $999. It's shaping up to be a potent phone for the photo fiends, but Google may have hyped up its AI features a little bit too much.

## Why Recasting Baylan Skoll Is the Most Respectful Thing To Do

The premiere season of Ahsoka on Disney + ended with an important reveal: Dark Jedi and mercenary Baylan Skoll made the journey to Peridea not to serve Morgan Elsbeth or Grand Admiral Thrawn but to find ancient relics and knowledge left behind by the Mortis Gods, central figures in the Force in Dave Filnoi’s Star Wars stories. But tragically, Baylan Skoll actor Ray Stevenson passed away following production of the first season of Ahsoka, leaving the future of the character uncertain. Kim Horcher makes a strong case for why the character should be recast, and why it might be the most respectful option to keep the character going.

We put Forza Motorsport and Gran Turismo 7 through their paces as we dive deep into the graphics, and physical effects a player will feel on a direct drive wheel, and do some FPS testing on each. Both games were tested across several different tracks with various lighting and weather conditions. We also talked to real-world driver Super GT about his opinion on how the game feels to drive on a Fanatec steering wheel out of the gate while also asking for some tips to improve. Forza Motorsport vs Gran Turismo 7 framerate is also tested, but I think the results may be surprising to some.

A huge thanks to Super GT for stopping by. Check out his channel at https://www.youtube.com/@Super_GT @Super_GT
