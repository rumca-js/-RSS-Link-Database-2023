Bob's Burgers is not only one of the best animated sitcoms on television currently, it's also one of the most loving and wholesome shows on TV.  Though when Bob's Burgers was first in development, there was a much darker tone to the Belcher Family.   Who knows if Bob's Burgers would have the success it has if the show maintained that dark tone.  But after 14 seasons, it seems the Bob's Burgers creator made the right call.
