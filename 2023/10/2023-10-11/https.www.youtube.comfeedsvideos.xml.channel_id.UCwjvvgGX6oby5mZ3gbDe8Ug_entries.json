Chinese people's Golden Holiday Is Miserable, No More Poetic Beauty and Wonder", "description": "#Chinainsights#Chinanews\nChina\u2019s Golden Week stretched from the end of September to the beginning of October. It was made up of two closely linked holidays. One is the traditional Mid-Autumn Festival or Moon Festival and the other is the anniversary of the CCP regime in China, known as the Oct. 1st National Day. \n\nWhile the official media made a big fuss about the holiday being long hence \"super golden week,\" many people found the number of break days had actually shrunk. The 7-day National Day holiday plus a 3-day Mid-Autumn Festival holiday is supposed to be a 10-day holiday. But it turned out to be only 8 days. People have thus made a math equation out of it;  \"3+7=8\". \n\nHave questions? Do you have something to share with us about China?
