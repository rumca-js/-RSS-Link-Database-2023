Buy one on Amazon: https://lon.tv/1ashu (compensated affiliate link) - The xScreen attaches to the back of the Xbox Series S and creates a portable gaming experience with the console. The display is powered by the Xbox so only one power cable is needed for everything - making it a great way to run it off a large power bank that has an AC inverter.
