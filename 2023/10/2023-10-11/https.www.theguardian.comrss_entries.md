<p>Monarch’s recognition will come as country prepares to celebrate 60 years of independence from Britain</p><p>King Charles will acknowledge the “painful aspects” of the UK and Kenya’s past during a state visit later this month.</p><p>The visit follows an invitation from the country’s president, William Ruto, whose country will celebrate the 60th anniversary of its independence from Britain on 12 December. The two countries have enjoyed a close relationship in recent years despite the violent colonial legacy of an uprising in the early 1950s, which led to a period known as “the emergency”, which ran from 1952 until 1960.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/oct/11/king-charles-to-acknowledge-painful-past-on-state-visit-to-kenya">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Regent’s Park, London<br /></strong>This corporate gathering full of artists’ drab, desperate attempts to get bought by clueless rich collectors has domesticated contemporary art and thus killed it</p><p>There is an unutterable sadness to seeing Damien Hirst’s new paintings at Frieze. These big pictures of gardens, their blurry photorealism besmirched with Pollockesque drips in a desperate attempt to bring such duds to life, are the star turn at Gagosian, one of the mightiest of the art dealers whose chic stands fill the vast white tent of the art fair. But no one looks fooled. Few are giving Hirst’s paintings a second look at the VIP view, which is filled with moneyed collectors, articulate salespeople, my daughter and me.</p><p>I try to explain to her how exciting and dangerous Hirst once was, when he was young, when he got someone to kill a tiger shark so he could put it in an art gallery. “He had the shark killed?” “Well, you don’t just find a tiger shark on a beach.

<p>Years of injury and frustration thwarting World Cup ambitions finally came to an end for England’s seamer against Bangladesh</p><p>If Reece Topley started his World Cup in a hurry, shredding Bangladesh’s top order with two wickets in his first over of the tournament, it is entirely understandable. After last year’s T20 World Cup and the IPL, this is the third global tournament he has travelled to in the past year or so, and in neither of the other two has he managed to get to the third over.</p><p>Many seamers struggle with injuries, the inevitable result of forcing the body to repeat very unnatural movements at high speed and high frequency, and Topley has endured several. But the two that ended those tournaments were something different: in Brisbane last year he tripped backwards over the boundary padding while warming up for a warm-up game and managed to rupture ligaments in his ankle, and in Bengaluru in March he dived in the field and dislocated a shoulder.</p> <a href="https

<p>You can drift off to ‘sleep stories’ from Styles, Maya Jama and Alan Titchmarsh. YouTubers host sleepalongs – or stream naps for laughs. Why are we getting under the covers with stars?</p><p>In July 2020, something new dropped from Harry Styles. Naturally, people went wild for it. But it wasn’t an album or a tour announcement. It was a bedtime story.</p><p>Produced as part of a series on the sleep and meditation app Calm, Styles’ story, Dream With Me, was an instant hit. According to Calm, the app crashed on the day it launched because so many people were trying to listen to it. Since then, Dream With Me has remained one of Calm’s most popular sleep stories. The company hasn’t shared individual figures, but combined with another story, Wonder, the two have had more than 30m listens. The reader of Wonder? Matthew McConaughey.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/oct/11/from-bedtime-with-harry-styles-to-watching-stars-snooze-the-meteoric-rise-of-sleep-celebs">C

<p>Standing ovations all round as Labour conference wraps up and many luxuriate in the feeling of a party poised to take power</p><p>We happy few. The morning after the afternoon before. It was a curious decision to schedule Keir Starmer’s speech for the Tuesday of the party conference. Almost like saying that the real business was in effect over with a day to spare. An invitation to some to pack up and go home early, which many delegates had happily accepted. Or else they had been partying late and forced to throw a sickie. Either way, most of the conference centre looked like something of a ghost town early on Wednesday.</p><p>But the show had to go on. Conferences abhor a vacuum. So we kicked off with Starmer doing a victory lap on the media round. They were some of the easiest interviews he will ever do, as no one had any tricky questions for him.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/oct/11/a-victory-lap-for-starmer-now-officially-a-member-of-the-glitterati">Con

No, far from it because he’s been offering out wisdom since the phrase ‘Keep Calm and Carry On’ was invented.

She wants concrete things: a car, a bed and, above all, cash to help her son.</p><p>Ironbound unfolds in a series of dialogues between Darja and three men. First is her on-off partner Tommy (Aongus Óg McAnally), then her Polish husband Maks (Konstantin Stanchev) who leaves her to pursue his dream of being a musician. The third is a young male sex worker, Vic (Lewis Harris), who finds Darja sleeping under cardboard on the street, her safety net gone.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.co

I realised, too, that it was a good idea to go out and photograph unique subjects: the biggest, the smallest, things that were about to disappear. When you’re the only person who has photographed something that has been and gone, that gives you an enormous advantage when people want images of it in the future.</p><p>So whenever I heard of something that fitted that category, I’d trot off and photograph it. If someone wanted to publish the photographs at the time, great. But at the back of my mind was always the thought: “This is really for the future.” And that was the case when I attended the Isle of Wight festivals, all three, in 1968,

<p>If the Israeli government responds to this moment like George W Bush, it will soon follow the route of his government from global sympathy to global outrage</p><p>Hamas’s appalling attack on Israeli civilians has been widely described as the country’s “<a href="https://www.skynews.com.au/opinion/sharri-markson/israels-911-moment-loss-of-life-following-hamas-attack-quite-staggering/video/8226e7a1204f0fef8913f5e01ad9471d">9/11 moment</a>”. It is an appropriate description of such wanton cruelty. But the analogy carries a cautionary note as well.</p><p>The US government lost the world’s sympathy, and the moral high ground, when its response to 9/11 degenerated into a highly abusive war in Iraq, systematic torture, and endless detention without trial in Guantánamo. The Israeli government should be careful not to replicate this path to opprobrium. Indeed, such an abusive response may be exactly what Hamas <a href="https://t.co/pCFRTWHzad">wanted</a> to provoke.</p> <a href="https://www

It focuses on the legendary boxer’s public life from 1959 to 1964, as he negotiated a new existence as world champion and member of the Nation of Islam, changing his name from Cassius Clay to (initially) Cassius X in a key transitional moment. It is written by Scottish author and producer Stuart Cosgrove, adapting his own 2020 book Cassius X: A Legend in the Making.</p><p>This perfectly watchable film moves with breezy fluency from Ali’s early years, the sensational gold medal at the 1960 Rome Olympics, the hilarious star-is-born interviews and media proclamations, the creepy cabal of white

<p>A chronicle of the author’s many affairs unable to be published during his lifetime</p><p>In the late stages of writing John le Carré’s biography, a doorstopper of 600-plus pages published in 2015 to largely appreciative reviews, Adam Sisman received an email from the writer’s wife, Jane. Attached was a 22-page memorandum of 196 corrections from the author, some of which queried source material that, as Sisman coolly notes with the mild glee of the vindicated, came from le Carré himself. The entire project – not an officially authorised biography but one undertaken with the knowledge and, to varying degrees, the cooperation of its subject – had been something of a push-me, pull-you affair.</p><p>Since the author of novels including the Smiley trilogy, The Night Manager and The Constant Gardener died in 2020 at the age of 89, there has been plenty for the aficionado to grapple with: a collection of his letters from 1945 until his final days, edited by his son Tim, who died in 2022,

<p>Winterson weaves her own thoughts on the supernatural with fictional explorations of apps, avatars and AI </p><p>Do you believe in ghosts?” In introducing her new collection of ghost stories, Jeanette Winterson begins with what might seem the obvious question. Is it, though? In fiction, the suspension of disbelief is usually a tacit arrangement. The writer gets on with the business of invention, leaving the reader to deliberate in private on matters of plausibility. In ghost stories, as in other speculative genres, this implicit contract seems all the more vital. For one thing, our beliefs are neither here nor there. We can enjoy a space opera without accepting that faster-than-light travel is possible (though no one seems to have told the users of Reddit). And in the finest ghost stories – like, say, The Turn of the Screw – the central question is left both unstated and forever unresolved.</p><p>I bring all this up because Winterson herself brings it up, and does so repeatedly.

<p>An orphaned Irish teenager spars with her scheming uncle in this insightful reworking of Sheridan Le Fanu’s novel</p><p>Here is a tightly laced, elegantly cut gothic period drama that easily slips through the cracks as the barrage of upmarket cinema vying for awards begins. The 19th-century source material, Sheridan Le Fanu’s novel Uncle Silas, isn’t super well-known outside university literature departments, and the lead actors aren’t especially famous names either – although gravelly-voiced David Wilmot, here playing the heavy, has built a career making indelible impressions with supporting roles on film (The Wonder, Ordinary Love, Calm With Horses) and TV (Station Eleven). Likewise, if you caught limited TV series Ridley Road then the talents of Agnes O’Casey will already be a known quantity. But in a way, the freshness of face and/or versatility of both O’Casey and Wilmot, along with the rest of the cast, are what makes this feel like a discovery. It’s definitely something new

<p>Anna Hints follows a group of Estonian women into their secluded cabin, where their communion is almost mystic and no topic is off limits</p><p>There is such raw emotional intimacy in this dazzling documentary from Estonia, filmed in a cabin in the woods where a group of women meet regularly to take a sauna.

Later, working from home and sitting at the desk in his room, he had noticed a small dark insect, then another, and another. Looking over at his bed, he saw one on the clean duvet cover. That’s when he made his sickening discovery. “I was, like, oh my God, this is horrific,” he says.
