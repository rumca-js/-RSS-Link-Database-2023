The determination is not final, and the company says it plans to appeal. The appeals process is expected to take several years, and the IRS finding is not expected to reflect Microsoft&#8217;s upcoming quarterly report. &#8220;We believe we have always followed the IRS’ rules and paid the taxes we owe in the U.S. and around the world,&#8221; wrote Daniel Goff, Microsoft&#8217;s corporate vice president for worldwide tax&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/irs-audit-finds-microsoft-owes-nearly-29-billion-in-taxes-company-plans-to-appeal/">Read More</a>

That was one takeaway from my conversations last night at the opening reception for the IA Summit, which takes place today in Seattle and focuses on intelligent and generative applications. A new report from insights firm GBK Collective found that 58% of senior leaders are actively using generative AI at work. A recent KPMG survey found that more than two-thirds of CEOs rank generative AI as a primary priority for their company. But the electric buzz around AI may be simmering off.

Arbel took a 10-hour flight from Boston to Tel Aviv, and by Tuesday he was working as a coordinator between the Israeli Air Force and ground forces on the frontlines in Israel&#8217;s rapidly escalating war with Gaza and Hamas militants. &#8220;The magnitude of the attack, the number of casualties, the number of civilians taken over the border by terrorists —&#160;that was unbelievable,&#8221; Arbel told GeekWire via&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/seattle-startups-co-founder-rejoins-israeli-military-in-war-i-cannot-just-stand-aside-and-do-nothing/">Read More</a>

In an update issued today, the Coast Guard said the transfer was made on Oct. 4. &#8220;Additional presumed human remains were carefully recovered from within Titan&#8217;s debris and transported for analysis by U.S. medical professionals,&#8221; it said.
