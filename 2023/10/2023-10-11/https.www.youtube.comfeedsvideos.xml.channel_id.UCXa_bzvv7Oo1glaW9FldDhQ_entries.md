With its Marvel’s Spider-Man games, the developer has managed to land on an excellent formula for slick open world traversal and authentic Spidey combat, but the developer deserves just as much credit (if not more) the stellar job it has done on a narrative level, having told two excellent Spider-Man stories so far that feel simultaneously unique and authentic and are populated by memorable characters. 

That there’s plenty of excitement to see more of that in Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 is no surprise, then, neither is the fact that those invested in the series’ story are heading into the game with a multitude of questions that they’re hoping to get the answers to. We certainly count ourselves in that group, and here, we’ll be talking about a few such questions.

NHL 24 takes steps to put the intense feel and physicality of ice hockey right into the hands of players. New gameplay systems such as the Exhaust Engine add a fresh tactical dimension to proceedings, and with brutal body checks and skill moves now mappable to the controller’s face buttons taking to the ice in NHL 24 is as exhilarating as ever. 

However, there are still certain game modes that demand a refresh at this point, and some of NHL 24’s touted new innovations, such as Vision Passing, aren’t new at all. The jury’s out on whether some of these new systems are even required at all. Still, NHL 24 is a solid entry in EA Sports’ ice hockey franchise, and worth diving in if you haven’t played a recent NHL title.
