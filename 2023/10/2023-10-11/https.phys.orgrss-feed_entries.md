Agricultural soils sustain life by producing food, but they also play an essential role in climate change, functioning as carbon sinks, storing large quantities of carbon and reducing its concentration in the atmosphere. Carbon is the main indicator of soils' fertility, so an increase in the concentration of this element means more nutrients and cleaner air.

The lunar terdiurnal ocean tide has a period of approximately 8.2804 hours, and theoretically has a small amplitude. Its largest equilibrium action term is just 2.56 mm, generally considered to have little impact on shipping or other maritime activities. Thus, it has not received much attention in previous studies, and understanding of the M3 tide's characteristics in various global regions is extremely limited.

When two black holes collide, the impact is so big that we can detect it all way here on Earth. These objects are so immense that their collisions send ripples through spacetime itself. Scientists call these ripples gravitational waves. Although Albert Einstein predicted the idea of gravitational waves all the way back in 1916, physicists didn't directly detect them until 2015 at LIGO (the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory).

Based on analyses of lunar samples, its now-deceased magnetic field may have been active for more than 1.5 billion years—give or take a billion years. Scientists believe it was generated like the Earth's via a dynamo process, whereby the spinning and churning of conductive liquid metal within a rocky planet's core generates a magnetic field.

Multiomics analysis that integrates different layers of profiles altogether is challenging, since the number of variables in profile substantially differ from each other. For instance, gene expression profile and genomic DNA methylation profile are often analyzed together; however, there are only tens of thousands of genes, whereas the number of DNA methylation sites are as many as tens of millions.

DNA, RNA, and proteins are three pillars of molecular biology. While DNA holds genetic instructions and proteins put these plans to action, RNA serves as the messenger and interpreter. DNA is transcribed to RNA, which then decodes those instructions to synthesize proteins. But large portions of RNA don't proceed to produce proteins, with a vast majority remaining just as RNA. What these molecules do or why they exist in such a state is still not fully understood.
