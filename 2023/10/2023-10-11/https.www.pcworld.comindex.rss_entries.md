<p>Technology giants continue to move towards password-free logins with passkeys. Passkeys create a cryptographic key pair with trusted devices (such as a smartphone) and a pin code or biometric authentication method, such as fingerprint or face reading, which can then be used to log in to sites and services.</p>



<p>The idea is to make account security easier and more secure than passwords. And now Google is taking further initiatives to get us to ditch the somewhat outdated login method. In a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/passkeys-default-google-accounts/&amp;xcust=2-3-2102651-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, the company writes that it is starting to offer passkeys as the default login method when trying to access your Google account.</p>

<p>Getting hands-on with the HP Spectre Foldable at a press event in Palo Alto California last week revealed an exciting reality about folding laptops: They&rsquo;ve now evolved past that first troubled stage that new-concept technologies occupy until later generations iron out their hang ups. The HP Spectre Foldable PC is a lot more refined than I was expecting, and mostly performs as well as HP claims it can.</p>



<p>The laptop&rsquo;s design was the first hint of that, being very slim and light to hold and so easy for me to manipulate. It measures just 0.33 x 14.8 x 10.9 inches unfolded (0.84 x 14.81 x 10.91 inches folded) and weighs just 2.99 pounds (3.58 pounds with the keyboard attached), which is slightly more compact and lightweight than its near rival the Asus Zephyrus 17 Fold OLED.</p>
