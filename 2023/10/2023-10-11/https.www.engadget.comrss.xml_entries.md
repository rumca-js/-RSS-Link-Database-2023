<p>The Effect Creator Rewards program was first announced in May with roughly $6 million set aside to pay the creators of effects and filters. Prior to the program's launch creators were essentially making filters, mini games and more for little to no reward — despite being integral to the success of the platform.

The game’s predecessor, <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em> (<em>CS:GO</em>), ran on those machines, but the company said since the refreshed title “represents the largest technical leap in <em>CS</em> history,” users on those platforms are out of luck.</p>
<p>In addition to macOS, older hardware, “including DirectX 9 and 32-bit operating systems,” are discontinued. Valve described the abandonment as a “difficult decision” based on technological advances. The company notes that, when combined, users on those platforms represented less than one percent of active <em>CS:GO</em> players, suggesting the gaming behemoth didn’t view legacy support for those platforms as a cost-conscious m

Not only will Netflix air the previously-released 20-episode first season later this year, but it’s also putting the final touches on the second season, which will stream sometime next year.</p>
<p>The initial cancellation came as a surprise, as Paramount had already greenlit a second season and those episodes were just about finished. Then it did that recent streamer thing where it went through and deleted all of the old episodes, kicking them to the dustbin of history.

<p>A new rule proposed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) would ban the sneaky fees some companies slap onto their services at checkout time. Thanks to these junk fees, which have crept into the process of everything from buying concert tickets to booking vacation rentals, the prices consumers initially see are often nowhere near what they end up paying.&nbsp;</p>

Simply put, the agency brought back a fairly large sample collection of various-sized rocks, dust particles and intermediate-sized particles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The big news here is that samples from the 4.5-billion-year-old asteroid contain not only carbon, which is to be expected, but also water. These are the building blocks of life on Earth and, likely, everywhere else, so this is a big deal.</p>

<p>You could be entitled to a small chunk of a $16 million class action settlement against anime streaming service Crunchyroll. The Sony-owned company settled a data privacy lawsuit this week that will result in about $30 settlements for individuals impacted, according to <a href="https://www.crvppasettlement.com/">firm behind the class action</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The complaint, filed in September 2022, claims that Sony shared individual Crunchyroll viewing information with third-party sites without user's permission. That means Google or Facebook might have seen your anime watch history without your knowledge.

<p><a href="https://www.zwift.com/how-it-works">Zwift</a> started out as the massively multiplayer online cycling and running app, providing virtual worlds to explore while working out. In 2022 the company joined the hardware market with its own smart bike trainer called the Zwift Hub. Today the company has launched the next generation called the <a href="https://us.zwift.com/">Zwift Hub One</a> ($599). It boasts virtual shifting, the Click handlebar-mounted shift controller and broader compatibility with a variety of bikes. The older model will continue to be available under the name Zwift Hub Classic ($599). Existing users can even upgrade their Hub (Classic) with the Zwift Cog/Click bundle without having to purchase an entirely new trainer.</p>
<p>Support for the Zwift Hub One and Zwift Cog will be part of the 1.50 version of Zwift which should be rolling out between October 11th and 13th this week. You’ll be able to add the Click shifter control under the Paired Devices section o

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-eats-will-begin-accepting-food-stamps-for-grocery-deliveries-in-2024-095521987.html">Uber Eats</a> is making it easier to fulfill your cravings, even if they're impossible to get from a single store or restaurant. The food delivery service has introduced a multi-store ordering feature, which lets you purchase food from two different merchants at the same time without having to pay additional delivery fees. It could be the answer for when your taste buds are looking for Vietnamese pho and ice cream, or if you and your housemate couldn't decide on whether to get tacos or pizza.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Previously, Uber Eats could only ask if you want to bundle your order with items from convenience stores like 7-11 during the checkout process. The company said that after testing out that feature, it received feedback from consumers asking for the capability to build one order from two different merchants instead. To bundle two orders, start by adding items

<p>It's an exciting time for astronomy enthusiasts as October is expected to bring a dazzling solar event. On October 14, there will be an annular solar eclipse viewable from some parts of the US, Mexico, Central and South America. Unlike a total solar eclipse, where the moon fully covers the sun, an annular eclipse occurs when the moon sits at the part of its orbit farthest from Earth. Because of the distance, the moon looks too small to completely block the sun, which creates a bright ring of sunlight around a dark lunar silhouette. This is often referred to as the "ring of fire."</p>
<p>To view the eclipse safely in person, you'll need <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-08-send-eclipse-glasses-to-schoolchildren.html"><ins>protective eyewear</ins></a> compliant with the ISO 12312-2 safety standard. You can also buy or create pinhole projectors. The eclipse will start over the Pacific Ocean and move southeast, passing over parts of the US, Mexico and

<p>If you have several Google Nest speakers, Chromecast and smart displays, you can <a href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Blog/Update-regarding-recent-changes-to-speaker-groups-for-Nest-speakers/ba-p/489728">add each of them</a> to several different groups in the Google Home app again. The company implemented changes last month, which would allow certain devices to be added to only one speaker group at a time in response to Sonos' patent lawsuit. This development, announced by the Nest team, undoes that change. If you'll recall, Sonos sued the company back in 2020, accusing it of infringing on several patents it holds, including ones related to managing groups of speakers.</p>
<p>In May, a California federal jury determined that Google had infringed on Sonos' intellectual property and ordered the tech giant to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-fined-325-million-for-infringing-on-sonos-patent-210411398.html">pay a $32.5 million fine</a>.

<p>Duolingo is launching its new music course sometime this fall. The educational tech company first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/duolingo-will-soon-offer-gamified-music-lessons-120010824.html">announced</a> that it was gearing up to add music lessons to its repertoire back in September, promising &quot;hundreds of bite-sized lessons&quot; that can teach you music with the help of over 200 tunes. Duolingo, of course, has turned music learning into a gamified experience, dividing lessons into levels you have to complete and docking points (or hearts) whenever you enter an incorrect answer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You'll start by having to familiarize yourself with the sounds of the C and D notes of C major using a digital piano. Duolingo will have you matching the sounds of each note with their placement on a staff, so you'd know what they sound like and could spot them on a music sheet by the time you're done. You'll move on to the next notes in subsequent lessons, but before you can proce
