Chinaâ€™s Golden Week stretched from the end of September to the beginning of October. It was made up of two closely linked holidays. One is the traditional Mid-Autumn Festival or Moon Festival and the other is the anniversary of the CCP regime in China, known as the Oct. 1st National Day. 

While the official media made a big fuss about the holiday being long hence "super golden week," many people found the number of break days had actually shrunk. The 7-day National Day holiday plus a 3-day Mid-Autumn Festival holiday is supposed to be a 10-day holiday. But it turned out to be only 8 days. People have thus made a math equation out of it;  "3+7=8".
