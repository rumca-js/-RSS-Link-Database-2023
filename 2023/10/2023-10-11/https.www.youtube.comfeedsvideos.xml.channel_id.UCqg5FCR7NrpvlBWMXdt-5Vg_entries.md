This week on Breakout, we interview the development team behind Outlast following the release of their documentary to learn more about the franchise, and making horror games in general!

Featuring Nick Calandra, Marty Sliva, and KC Nwosu, the freeform podcast dives into a bit of our daily lives, the latest games, movies, tv shows and books, the occasional craft beer review and random topics we find interesting.
