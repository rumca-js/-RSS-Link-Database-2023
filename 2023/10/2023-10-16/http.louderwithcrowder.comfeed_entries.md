But they never expected a black bear to stroll in last Monday morning. </p><p>A Canadian bear was caught on security video sniffing around inside the convenience store — and making off with a pack of gummy bears.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

A kangaroo tried to drown a man's dog. While staring at the man, as if to say, "Yeah, I got your dog. What's up now?"</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

If you are wearing a Payton jersey, you're legit. If you're wearing the jersey of the QB who has you going 4 -19 over the last two seasons you look like you jumped on the bandwagon too soon. Not that I'm above jumping on a bandwagon myself. But at least my QB is Josh Allen.</p><p>Our video starts has our skirmish is already in progress, allegedly over the bathroom at the Bears game.
