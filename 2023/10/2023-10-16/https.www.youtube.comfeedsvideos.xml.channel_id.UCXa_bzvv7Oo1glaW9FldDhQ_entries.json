Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man 2 continues on that well-established goodwill by creating an ambitious sequel that expands on those concepts in a meaningful fashion. \n\nApart from the gameplay, Spider-Man 2 is also a step up in the visual department as it presents its version of New York with markedly more attention to detail as well as raw visual fidelity. \n\nWith this graphics analysis, we take a look at the technical make-up of Spider-Man 2 and also graphically compare it to PS5\u2019s versions of Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man and Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man: Miles Morales.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB31xzNGepQ", "date_published": "2023-10-16T14:00:34+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/gB31xzNGepQ/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Marvel's Spider-Man 2 Review - The Final Verdict", "description": "Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man 2 is a fantastic sequel- it is, in fact, exactly the kind of sequel you were probably hoping it\u2019d be. Not only does it improve upon its predecessors in areas that obviously needed improvements \u2014 like the open world and its optional offerings \u2013 it also makes surprising improvements in areas where it was already starting from a ridiculously strong position, like the traversal and the combat. \n\nFrom the incredible sense of speed and moment you get while zipping through the city to the marked improvements made in the combat department, from the numerous boss fights and set piece moments packed into the story and more, Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man 2 is a game with many highs, even if it does stumble in some ways from time to time.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVI0Ix6_th4", "date_published": "2023-10-16T14:00:12+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/HVI0Ix6_th4/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Ghostrunner 1 vs 2 - 15 BIGGEST Differences You Need To Know", "description": "Adding on to all the big releases this month is 505 Games' Ghostrunner 2, which is coming soon to Xbox Series X/S, PS5 and PC. It's a follow-up to the 2020 hack-and-slash action and adventure, with Jack embarking on a new adventure outside the tower.\n\nWhile the sequel is vaster than the original in scale, several new mechanics and features are available to freshen things up. New abilities, new block and Perfect-Parry moves, a bike with separate levels (some hyped as \"open world\"), new enemies and much more await players.\n\nThere's even an HQ and dialogue system for interacting with different characters, not to mention Community Challenges.

I am all for slow and methodical gameplay, but speed is often stifled to a slow crawl by rocky terrain, and sluggish controls hinder an otherwise average experience. \n\nAs both a racing and team management sim, Overpass 2 manages to bundle multiple gameplay mechanics into one package without excelling at any of them. Racing fans will find better experiences in other titles already on the market.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTWRqEj2Hs0", "date_published": "2023-10-16T10:30:04+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/DTWRqEj2Hs0/hqdefault.jpg"}]
