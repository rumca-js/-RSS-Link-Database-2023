We&#8217;ve reached out to the company for more details.

In a blog post on Monday, Amazon said that the first critical steps of Kuiper&#8217;s Protoflight mission are complete. The satellites rode a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida into space Friday at 11:06 a.m. PT. “There’s plenty of work ahead, but at this point in the mission, I’m thrilled to report that KuiperSat-1 and KuiperSat-2 are operating nominally,” Rajeev Badyal, Project Kuiper’s vice&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/amazons-project-kuiper-prototype-satellites-are-stable-in-orbit-and-collecting-key-data/">Read More</a>

## Wizards of the Coast’s ‘Planescape: Adventures in the Multiverse’ is a reintroduction to infinity

In 2023, every big nerd franchise from Spider-Man to Mortal Kombat is built on the concept of a multiverse, and Planescape did that for Dungeons &#38; Dragons in 1994. It was the last great campaign setting from D&#38;D&#8216;s original publisher, which led to the development of the cult-classic PC game Planescape: Torment, and has had a big influence on D&#38;D ever since. After 25 years, Renton, Wash.-based Wizards of the Coast is finally revisiting Planescape with a 3-book boxed set Planescape: Adventures in the Multiverse ($79.99), by Justice&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/wizards-of-the-coasts-planescape-adventures-in-the-multiverse-is-a-reintroduction-to-infinity/">Read More</a>

But when he wanted to better learn how to take advantage of their capabilities, he discovered existing online courses were not yet prepared to instruct users about AI effectively. &#8220;I realized that there&#8217;s this huge gap,&#8221; said Bystron. &#8220;All the tools we&#8217;re getting right now are either not fun or semi-effective because they&#8217;re applying the same model they&#8217;ve applied to any other learning.&#8221; Bystron decided to build a tool himself.
