So whether you played the original Spider-Man and Miles Morales and want a quick story refresher, or you\u2019re just jumping into Spider-Man 2, let\u2019s break down the story so far.\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:19 - Spider-Man\n09:31 - The City That Never Sleeps\n13:49 - Spider-Man: Miles Morales\n\nFrom Spider-Man\u2019s opening duel with the Kingpin of Crime, Wilson Fisk through to Miles Morales\u2019 crusade against Roxxon and the Underground, this video breaks down and recaps the full story so far in Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man series for PS5.\n\n#SpiderMan2 #MilesMorales #GameSpot\n\nTimeline Playlist - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gaFRoP4RUA&amp;list=PLpg6WLs8kxGN7aotOq-B5tYZWpvTZ3KRS", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57tIe5BjGpE", "date_published": "2023-10-16T17:00:06+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GameSpot - YouTube", "album": "GameSpot - YouTube", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/57tIe5BjGpE/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Marvel's Spider-Man 2 Review", "description": "Marvel's Spider-Man 2 delivers an incredible story about heroes and villains grappling with loneliness.\n\nThere's quite a bit of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 that can be summed up as \"more of the same.\" Granted, that's a good thing--both the original game and the Miles Morales-focused follow-up feature fantastic reimaginings of their respective Spider-Men, exhilarating web-swinging, and superb combat mechanics. Who wouldn't just want more of that? And sure, more of what came before does mean that Spider-Man 2 retreads less successful ground, like the first game's buzz-killing science puzzles. However, the good far outweighs the bad, and a few new gameplay mechanics freshen up aspects of both traversal and combat. Altogether, it's a great game and one well worth seeing all the way through from its bombastic beginning to its emotional end.\u00a0\n\nIf you want to read the review check it out here: https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvels-spider-man-2-review-web-warriors/1900-6418134/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB6K70-322U", "date_published": "2023-10-16T14:00:32+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GameSpot - YouTube", "album": "GameSpot - YouTube", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/bB6K70-322U/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Marvel's Spider-Man 2 - Official Launch Trailer", "description": "Spider-Men, Peter Parker and Miles Morales, return for an exciting new adventure in the critically acclaimed Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man franchise for the PS5 console.
