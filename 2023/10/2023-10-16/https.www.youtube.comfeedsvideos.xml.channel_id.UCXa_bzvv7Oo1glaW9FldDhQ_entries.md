Insomniac Games has done a great job with its Spider-Man games, which is easily one of the best renditions of the friendly neighborhood webhead in video game form. Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 continues on that well-established goodwill by creating an ambitious sequel that expands on those concepts in a meaningful fashion. 

Apart from the gameplay, Spider-Man 2 is also a step up in the visual department as it presents its version of New York with markedly more attention to detail as well as raw visual fidelity. 

With this graphics analysis, we take a look at the technical make-up of Spider-Man 2 and also graphically compare it to PS5’s versions of Marvel’s Spider-Man and Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales.

Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 is a fantastic sequel- it is, in fact, exactly the kind of sequel you were probably hoping it’d be. Not only does it improve upon its predecessors in areas that obviously needed improvements — like the open world and its optional offerings – it also makes surprising improvements in areas where it was already starting from a ridiculously strong position, like the traversal and the combat. 

From the incredible sense of speed and moment you get while zipping through the city to the marked improvements made in the combat department, from the numerous boss fights and set piece moments packed into the story and more, Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 is a game with many highs, even if it does stumble in some ways from time to time.

Adding on to all the big releases this month is 505 Games' Ghostrunner 2, which is coming soon to Xbox Series X/S, PS5 and PC. It's a follow-up to the 2020 hack-and-slash action and adventure, with Jack embarking on a new adventure outside the tower.

While the sequel is vaster than the original in scale, several new mechanics and features are available to freshen things up. New abilities, new block and Perfect-Parry moves, a bike with separate levels (some hyped as "open world"), new enemies and much more await players.

There's even an HQ and dialogue system for interacting with different characters, not to mention Community Challenges. Check out 15 differences between Ghostrunner 1 and 2 before the sequel's release on October 26th.

## Overpass 2 Review - The Final Verdict

Overpass 2 is an off-roading experience fraught with major and minor hiccups from controls to basic racing mechanics that ultimately prove to be unsatisfactory. I am all for slow and methodical gameplay, but speed is often stifled to a slow crawl by rocky terrain, and sluggish controls hinder an otherwise average experience. 

As both a racing and team management sim, Overpass 2 manages to bundle multiple gameplay mechanics into one package without excelling at any of them. Racing fans will find better experiences in other titles already on the market.
