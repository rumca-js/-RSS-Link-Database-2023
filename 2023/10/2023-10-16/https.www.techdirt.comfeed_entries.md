This case contains multitudes. Let me explain. There&#8217;s an exception to the Fourth Amendment known as &#8220;inevitable discovery.&#8221; That theory says the evidence obtained by possibly unlawful means would still have been discovered by lawful means.

Landmark Technology’s U.S. Patent No.&#160;7,010,508, and its predecessor, are very likely two of the most-abused patents in U.S. history. These patents, under two different owners, have been used to threaten thousands of small businesses since 2001.&#160; In just one 18-month period, the ‘508 patent was the subject of more than 1,800 patent demand letters sent [&#8230;]

Wade, there was no decades-long effort by the Federalist Society to undermine 1st Amendment principles, such as those established by the [&#8230;]

Minors attending public schools may find their rights are limited, due to a variety of factors: school safety, access to learning, etc. But they&#8217;re not nonexistent. This much courts have made clear, including the top court in the land. Nevertheless, school administrators seem to feel students should be treated as suspects until proven otherwise. In [&#8230;]
