Just shy of a month after Payday 3 decidedly rocky launch, which left many unable to play the always-online heist shooter, its long-awaited first patch is still nowhere to be seen; developer Starbreeze has announced a second delay for the update, after it "identified some issues that need to be fixed".
</p><p>
Payday 3 got off to a decidedly wobbly start last month, with the game drawing criticism for its matchmaking issues, its online-only requirements (proving particularly irksome for solo players forced into lengthy queues), and a hugely unpopular challenge-focused progression system.
</p><p>
Matchmaking has n<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-matchmaking-issues-sorted-gameplay-now-stable-developer-says">ow been improved</a>, and Starbreeze has pledged at least "some changes" to progression, but Payday 3's first patch is

Ahead of Cities: Skylines 2's release next week, publisher Paradox Interactive has admitted the city building sequel has "not achieved the [performance] benchmark we targeted". However, rather than delaying the game to remedy those issues the publisher has decided "releasing now is the best way forward".
</p><p>
The somewhat astonishing admission was shared in a <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/updates-on-modding-and-performance-for-cities-skylines-ii.1601865/">post on the official Paradox forum</a>, written to address "concerns raised about Cities: Skylines 2 performance" following the publisher's decision to increase Cities Skylines 2's minimum and recommended specs on PC and to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-console-release-gets-delayed">delay the game on Xb

Psychedelic horror Layers of Fear - the 2023 remake as opposed to the 2016 original - is getting a free new story chapter on 24th October to mark developer Bloober Team's 15th anniversary.
</p><p>
Layers of Fear (again, the new one) already featured a decent chunk of new content, of course, reconfiguring the stories of Layers of Fear 1 and 2, as well as the first game's Inheritance DLC, into a single narrative - all spruced up with striking Unreal Engine 5 visuals and new gameplay elements. And then there's a new story chapter featuring the original protagonist's wife, plus a new framing device focusing on a lighthouse-bound character known as The Writer.
</p><p>
Bloober's newly announced Halloween/birthday treat makes yet another tortured artist - joining the Painter, Actor, Musician, and Writer from th

Analogue, the boutique console manufacturer known for its work building slick machines capable of playing classic retro cartridges, has announced the Analogue 3D - a "reimagining of the N64" that's coming in 2024.
</p><p>
Analogue 3D, which follows the likes of 2021's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/analogue-announces-the-pocket-an-all-new-all-encompassing-retro-handheld">well-regarded Analogue Pocket</a> and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/analogue-announces-its-take-on-the-pc-engine">PC-Engine-inspired Analogue Duo</a>, is another FPGA machine, and promises 100% compatibility with N64 games from every region: USA, EU, and Japan.
</p><p>
It can output at 4K resolution, features original display modes, and also includes "reference quality recreations of specific model CRTs and PVMs".

Netflix is reportedly looking to build upon its current, predominantly mobile-focused gaming offerings by introducing "higher-end" titles to its subscription catalogue - and is said to have had discussions about licensing a Grand Theft Auto game as part of the move.
</p><p>
The streaming company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-new-mobile-games-service-arrives-on-ios-tomorrow">took its first tentative steps into gaming</a> back in November 2021, with the release of five iOS and Android titles that could be downloaded and played as part of a Netflix subscription. Since then, its gaming catalogue has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-game-catalogue-is-often-overlooked-but-plenty-are-worth-your-time">swelled to over 70 titles</a> and it's made a number notable acquisitions, including Triple Town and Cozy Grove deve

Pok&eacute;mon Go has now fully detailed Party Play, a major new multiplayer layer coming to the popular monster collection app seven years after its initial release.
</p><p>
Party Play is designed to reward groups of people playing alongside each other in the real world, with gameplay bonuses, extra challenges and the ability to see each others' avatars in-game on Pok&eacute;mon Go's map.
</p><p>
Perhaps most enticing for players is a new Party Power raid bonus, which will double the damage of Charged Attacks in the game's popular PVE battles.

Bethesda exec Pete Hines has announced his retirement after 24 years at the company, just weeks after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-guides-tips-tricks-9352">Starfield</a>'s launch. 
</p><p>
In a statement shared on X (formerly Twitter), the now-former head of publishing said he would begin an "exciting new chapter", which will include "exploring interests and passions, donating my time where I can, and taking more time to enjoy life".
</p><p>
Hines said this was not a decision he came to easily, but "after an amazing career, culminating in the incredible launch of Starfield, it feels like the time is right."

## Marvel's Spider-Man 2 review - cluttered but no less lovable action

Spider-Man's always been a busy guy. He's got classes to attend - or in this slightly older Peter Parker's case now, teach. He's got a girlfriend to see, friends to check in on, past-due bills to pay, a job to fail to hold down, and in between it all an apparently limitless sense of duty to do the right thing. A large part of his charm - and Spidey, of all the superheroes, is nothing without charm - is in the fallibility that comes from his quest to balance an impossible schedule. 
</p><p>
It's also, by far, the deepest well of good material that any Spider-Man writer worth their salt knows to plunge. It's the source of some of Sam Raimi's best scenes in the noughties era movies: grumpy landlord Mr. Ditkovich, and his gangly daughter Ursula's peace offering of chocolate cake; Willem Dafoe's much-memed "I'm some

Built for PlayStation 5, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 expands on the Insomniac's in-house technology, delivering a game with a larger scope and a brand-new spider plot to follow. The title in this case couldn't be more apt with players swapping between the two Spider-Men seamlessly over the course of the story as you explore a greatly expanded game world. In DF tradition then, I wanted to break down this game's new visual and gameplay features highlighting the positives and negatives along the way. At first glance it may feel familiar but, trust me, there is a lot here to unpack. </p><p>The release of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 marks Insomniac's fourth game shipped on PS5, following Miles Morales, Spider-Man Remastered and Ra

After Cyberpunk 2077's much anticipated release in 2020 failed to live up to expectations, the team's morale took a "significant hit". 
</p><p>
That's according to Colin Walder, an engineering director at CD Projekt Red with over 15 years of experience in the games industry, who previously worked on The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, and Rockstar titles Red Dead Redemption 2 and Grand Theft Auto 5. Walder recently spoke to <a href="https://www.invenglobal.com/articles/18582/cd-projekt-reds-colin-walderactions-speak-louder-than-words-people-need-to-see-it-to-believe-it">invenglobal</a> at the Inven Game Conference in South Korea, where he discussed lessons learned from Cyberpunk 2077.

A group of Just Stop Oil protestors made a scene at EGX yesterday, and interrupted a Tekken esports tournament. 
</p><p>
EGX, the UK's biggest games event, ran from Thursday to Sunday last week and is run by Eurogamer's parent company Reedpop.
</p><p>
Protestors attempted to squirt orange paint at a screen displaying an in-progress Tekken match, before daubing more on the two players' screens. They then began a short speech, before being dragged off by security.

Matthew Mercer has confirmed he's the voice actor behind Vincent Valentine in Square Enix's forthcoming Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.

In fact, he was already in Final Fantasy 7 Remake playing multiple additional voices.
</p><p>
Mercer made the announcement at New York Comic Con where he hosted a panel of actors from the game: Cody Christian (Cloud Strife), John Eric Bentley (Barret Wallace), Britt Baron (Tifa Lockhart), Max Mittelman (Red XIII) and Suzie Yeung (Yuffie Kisaragi).

There won't be an English dub for Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His on its launch next month. 
</p><p>
As noted by Kiryu's English voice actor Yong Yea, an English dub will instead be released as part of a post-launch patch. "Hope you'll look forward to it," Yea <a href="https://twitter.com/YongYea/status/1713645331198652548">wrote</a> on X (formerly Twitter), while highlighting this overlooked detail. 
</p><p>
On its launch, the game will be only playable in Japanese with English subtitles. At the time of writing, there is no release date for Like a Dragon Gaiden's English dub patch. We will, of course, update you when we know more.
