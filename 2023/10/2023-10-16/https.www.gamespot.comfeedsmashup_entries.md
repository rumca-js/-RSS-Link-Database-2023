<p>Call of Duty's roster of playable Operators has expanded with the arrival of Lilith from Diablo IV. The Demon Mother is available in Modern Warfare II and Warzone as part of a $20 bundle that comes with a variety of cosmetics. She also has a brutal finishing move where she obliterates her foes and leaves their corpse in a pool of their own blood.</p><p>The Lilith Operator Bundle, as it's called, is available now in the in-game shop for 2,400 COD Points ($20).

Following on from the events of 2018's Spider-Man and 2022's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, the sequel teams both of New York's resident arachnid-themed heroes up for a tale that pits them against the likes of the Lizard, Kraven the Hunter, and Venom. Like previous Spider-Man stories, the Venom symbiote is first introduced as a powerful and corruptive force that attaches itself to Peter Parker, transforming the noble hero into a darker and more brutal vigilante before the two eventually separate and the alien organism finds a new host--and also gets much more swole in the process.</p><p>So far, reviews range are all highly positive.

<p>There's quite a bit of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvels-spider-man-2/">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> that can be summed up as "more of the same." Granted, that's a good thing--both the original game and the Miles Morales-focused follow-up feature fantastic reimaginings of their respective Spider-Men, exhilarating web-swinging, and superb combat mechanics. Who wouldn't just want <em>more </em>of that? And sure, more of what came before does mean that Spider-Man 2 retreads less successful ground, like the first game's buzz-killing science puzzles. However, the good far outweighs the bad, and a few new gameplay mechanics freshen up aspects of both traversal and combat. Altogether, it's a great game and one well worth seeing all the way through from its bombastic beginning to its emotional end.</p><p dir="ltr">Like the first two games, the true star of Spider-Man 2 is its story.
