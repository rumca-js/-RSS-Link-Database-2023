Amazon founder Jeff Bezos&#8217; Kent, Wash.-based space venture is calling the platform Blue Ring, and it&#8217;s being developed by a new Blue Origin business unit called In-Space Systems, according to a Monday blog post. Blue Ring would serve commercial and government customers with in-space logistics and delivery, including cloud computing capability, for missions in medium Earth orbit out to the cislunar region and beyond. \u201cBlue Ring addresses two of the&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2023/blue-origin-unveils-blue-ring-a-multi-use-space-platform-to-aid-missions-to-earth-orbit-and-be", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2023/blue-origin-unveils-blue-ring-a-multi-use-space-platform-to-aid-missions-to-earth-orbit-and-beyond/", "date_published": "2023-10-16T20:35:47+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GeekWire", "album": "GeekWire", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://www.geekwire.com/wp-content/themes/geekwire/dist/images/geekwire-logo-rss.png"}, {"source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed/", "title": "Seattle\u2019s Climate Pledge Arena is the first arena in the world to land Zero Carbon certification", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"945\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/kraken_3208-2-1260x945.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />Seattle&#8217;s Climate Pledge Arena is the first in the world to receive Zero Carbon certification from an international nonprofit promoting sustainable buildings.

In 2023, every big nerd franchise from Spider-Man to Mortal Kombat is built on the concept of a multiverse, and Planescape did that for Dungeons &#38; Dragons in 1994. It was the last great campaign setting from D&#38;D&#8216;s original publisher, which led to the development of the cult-classic PC game Planescape: Torment, and has had a big influence on D&#38;D ever since. After 25 years, Renton, Wash.-based Wizards of the Coast is finally revisiting Planescape with a 3-book boxed set Planescape: Adventures in the Multiverse ($79.99), by Justice&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2023/wizards-of-the-coasts-planescape-adventures-in-the-multiverse-is-a-reintroduction-to-infinity/\">Read More</a>", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2023/wizards-of-the-coasts-planescape-adventures-in-the-multiverse-is-a-reintroduction-to-infinity/", "date_published": "2023-10-16T15:02:25+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GeekWire", "album": "GeekWire", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://www.geekwire.com/wp-content/themes/geekwire/dist/images/geekwire-logo-rss.png"}, {"source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed/", "title": "Duolingo for AI: Seattle startup wants to teach people how to use generative tools like ChatGPT", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"709\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Untitled-design-5-1260x709.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />As a project leader at Boston Consulting Group, Rene Bystron quickly incorporated generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Midjourney into his daily workflow. But when he wanted to better learn how to take advantage of their capabilities, he discovered existing online courses were not yet prepared to instruct users about AI effectively. &#8220;I realized that there&#8217;s this huge gap,&#8221; said Bystron. &#8220;All the tools we&#8217;re getting right now are either not fun or semi-effective because they&#8217;re applying the same model they&#8217;ve applied to any other learning.&#8221; Bystron decided to build a tool himself.
