In today's Daily Fix:
Bethesda announced today that Head of Publishing, Pete Hines, is leaving the company after a 24-year stint. Hines posted on social media, saying he's leaving to basically pursue other interests. He was Bethesda's Senior VP of Global Marketing for most of his time there, being promoted to Head of Publishing only last year. In other news, the anticipated city building sim, Cities: Skylines 2 will be launching with known performance issues...and the publisher and developer are okay with that. It's safe to assume there will be patches shortly after release. And finally, Analogue has a new device coming, and it's likely not another take on their popular Pocket handheld. The Analogue 3D is an N64 player, able to play all Nintendo 64 games regardless of region. And they're teasing a new controller made by 8BitDo.

A man who struggles to survive after awakening alone, trapped in a society connected only by a primitive computer network, where the ability to entertain is the only currency.
Grappling with a flickering, faulty memory of his life before, the film’s nameless protagonist (Melvin Gregg) discovers that his unseen audience seems to reward his moments of humiliation and pain. Building off this realization, he crafts a self-destructive comedic persona that allows him to not just survive, but thrive in his new world.
Rewarded with “socialization” via video feeds, the man develops relationships with other inhabitants, including a cantankerous veteran of the system (Bradley Whitford), and two women (Alice Braga and Danielle Campbell) who confront him with opposed worldviews. Should he accept his confinement and try to find some form of happiness within it, or fight a seemingly unwinnable war with the system that imprisons him?

Endless Dungeon reviewed on PC by Justin Koreis. Also available on PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch. 

It requires an almost brash confidence to mash up a twin-stick shooter with a tower defense game, and then further mix that into a sci-fi roguelite. But somehow Endless Dungeon pulls it off, blending them all seamlessly into a great package that strikes just the right balance of action, strategy, and rewarding progression. It can occasionally be frustrating when the random elements stack the deck completely against you, but strong persistent upgrade options make each run still feel like you’ve accomplished something. With a great cast of heroes, a deep roster of monsters, and stellar co-op, Endless Dungeon is an audacious blend that’s worth opening that next door to find.

## Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged Review

Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged reviewed by Luke Reilly on Xbox Series X|S. Also available on Xbox One, PlayStation, Switch, and PC.

"An impeccably detailed and blisteringly fast racer with incredible graphics and rock-solid arcade underpinnings, Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 picks up where the surprisingly excellent 2021 original left off. That is, it’s not just the best thing on the breakfast bench since Micro Machines – it’s one of the strongest and most imaginative arcade racers available today. It’s definitely guilty of forgetting to suitably cater to its wide audience at times, it’s stingy on older cars, and it would’ve been a much bigger and better package if it didn’t completely shed its previous track locations, but the last time Mattel had wheels this worthy of a whirl they were welded beneath Ryan Gosling’s rollerblades."
