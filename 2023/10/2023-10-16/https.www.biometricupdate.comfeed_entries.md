		Proponents and opponents of police using facial recognition in the U.S. state of Massachusetts appear to have battled to a compromise.

Privacy and civil liberties <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202103/facial-recognition-had-an-unruly-couple-of-years-in-massachusetts-aclu">advocates</a> have fought to ban the use of facial recognition by police for many reasons including that some algorithms are less accurate for people who are not white males. Law enforcement supporters maintained that biometrics are too valuable a tool for police to ignore.

<a href="https://legiscan.com/MA/text/S927/2023">Proposed state legislation</a> in Massachusetts would ban biometric surveillance and identification regardless of where the algorithm came from for local police

		Germany has announced that its citizens will be required to submit photographs in line with biometrics standards to obtain identification documents starting in May 2025.

The move is intended to increase convenience for German citizens, especially while crossing the border. The new procedure will also lower the risks of fraud and the misuse of identity documents. The photos will have to meet the international requirements for biometric matching as defined by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), said the government in an announcement.

In September, the country also <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/german-kids-passports-all-go-biometric-next-year">announced</a> it is doing away with paper passports for children, replacing them with card

		The results of the <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/-/media/2a928b6acd804afa9e699bb4c262cc14.pdf">2023 Workforce Authentication Report</a> are out, and show employers eager to move beyond passwords and embrace passwordless authentication through biometrics or other means.

		Kenya’s digital ID project, known as <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/maisha-namba">Maisha Namba</a>, will receive advice from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

The global charity group, started by the Microsoft founder, will help connect the Kenyan government to key technical experts and partners, Mark Suzman, CEO at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, <a href="https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/gates-foundation-to-advise-on-maisha-namba-rollout--4402224">told</a> Business Daily Africa.

Officials say outsourcing development and operations of a new system would save the government money. It also would likely raise objections among privacy advocates by putting the biometric data, including DNA, of residents in commercial hands.

The Department of Justice's CIO <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/doj-plans-modernization-of-biometric-service-for-criminal-civil-checks">wants to hear</a> about contractor-owned and -operated biometric functions that are now part of separate DOJ automated-booking and civil-applicant applications.

		Ethiopia's National ID Program (NIDP) is on the fast lane to popularizing its digital ID system with a series of partnership deals lately, the latest of which has been struck with the country office of the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF).

A few days ago, the UNICEF country director for Ethiopia, Aboubacar Kampo, and the Executive Director of the NIDP, Yodahe Zemichael, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that will support the registration of all residents in the country for the digital ID scheme.

		The acquisition of biometric attendance machines from China and Thailand by some municipal offices in Taiwan’s capital Taipei has sparked major concerns about data privacy and security with the use of the devices.

The concerns have prompted Taipei City government officials to assure that they’ll make sure such devices, which include face and fingerprint biometrics capabilities, have security guarantees and that they comply with regulatory provisions, Taipei Times <a href="https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2023/10/14/2003807677">reports</a>.
