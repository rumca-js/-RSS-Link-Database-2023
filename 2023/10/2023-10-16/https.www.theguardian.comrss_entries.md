<p>Following Hamas's deadly attack on Israel on 7 October, the Israeli army launched a heavy campaign of airstrikes across the Gaza strip. The air raids have caused widespread damage, displacing over a million people and killing more than 2,800 civilians, according to the Palestinian health ministry. Afaf Al Najjar, a resident of Gaza City, lived in a district that was bombarded by airstrikes, and after Israel issued an evacuation order through leaflets dropped from the sky, she left with her family for Khan Younis.

<p>Saskatchewan invokes clause to push through controversial bill requiring parental consent for children to change pronouns </p><p>The Canadian province of Saskatchewan has invoked a rare constitutional mechanism to shield controversial gender pronoun legislation from legal challenges – a decision critics say violates the rights of minors.</p><p>On Monday, Saskatchewan’s legislative assembly started debate on Bill 137, which outlines the rights parents have as the “primary decision-maker” in their child’s education. Among the most controversial is the provision requiring parental consent before school staff use a desired gender identity or gender-related preferred name if the student is under the age of 16. The bill also says that if obtaining parental permission could cause harm to the child, the principal will connect the student with support to develop a plan to come out to their parents.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/16/canada-school-saskatchewan-gender

And yet, according to the internet at least, the most adorable thing in the film is not the eponymous heroine but her consort, Ken. Margot Robbie’s Barbie may be glamorous, but Ryan Gosling’s Ken is cute – quite an accomplishment for a man-baby intent on imposing patriarchy on Barbie Land.</p><p>Scientists have been studying the nature of cuteness for decades. It’s now widely accepted that we are hardwired to both look and act cute when we’re very young and to respond to cuteness ourselves. When kids are cute, women and men alike pay attention to them and care for them, which not only helps children to survive but also to learn how to communicate and cooperate.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/202

<p>I moved to New York this year and am embroiled in a Kafkaesque ordeal trying to get my meds filled</p><p>Back in 2019, I was diagnosed with ADHD at age 40, a process I described <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/10/tuning-out-the-static-it-took-40-years-before-i-found-out-that-i-have-adhd">for the Guardian</a>. The diagnosis came as a surprise to me, but not to anyone I knew: sure, I’d never been especially hyperactive (or even, y’know, active), but the chronic lateness, difficulty concentrating, lack of emotional self-regulation and decades-long struggle to locate my keys … these were all classic symptoms.</p><p>I was prescribed a medication called Vyvanse, which I’ve been taking daily since. It’s proven immensely helpful, allowing me to settle into a reasonably steady routine of writing and working. The days when I just can’t get anything done have been further and further separated by periods of unprecedented productivity.</p> <a href="https://www.theg

<p>Maysoon Pachachi’s fiction debut, set in Baghdad in 2006, focuses on individuals behind the headlines, with the river Tigris a recurring symbol</p><p>After the American-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, the images of the country that circulated in mainstream media were of destruction and violence, and a sensationalised visual landscape that robbed locals of their individuality. Shot on location in Iraq, this compelling fiction debut from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/may/01/maysoon-pachachi-iraq-baghdad-film">seasoned documentary-maker Maysoon Pachachi</a> paints a slice-of-life portrait of a mixed Baghdad neighbourhood during the tumultuous final week of 2006, a year memorably ended by the execution of Saddam Hussein.</p><p>Save for a scene where a bargeman fishes out of the water the body of a woman presumably killed for her association with foreign forces, Our River … Our Sky alludes to the horrors of war and sectarian violence in subtle and non-explicit terms.

<p>I needed something to get me out of my own head, and Lucy Fur was a wonderful distraction from the darkness – a perfect friend who died too soon</p><p>In May 2012, at the age of 25, I decided to co-parent a hamster with my housemate. Broke and depressed and partying too hard, we were in desperate need of an emotional support animal, with a hamster seeming the most financially viable and responsible option.</p><p>Bringing our new arrival back on the bus from the pet store, excitement soon turned to panic when she began frantically gnawing her way out of the flimsy cardboard carrier. No one noticed except a woman and her young daughter sitting opposite us, who watched wide-eyed as I pressed the box against my chest, blocking the ever-multiplying holes with credit cards, a bag of tobacco and sweaty palms. In a desperate attempt to help, the lady offered us her tote bag before realising it wasn’t really something she could sacrifice, seeing as it contained all her belongings. We only

<p>The acclaimed adaptation of Daphne du Maurier’s short story remains a visually immersive descent and a chilling portrayal of loss</p><p>In the opening sequence of Nicolas Roeg’s Don’t Look Now, a little girl in a red raincoat drowns in a pond in the English countryside, as her parents are nestled comfortably in a nearby estate. Roeg cuts frantically between the girl tooling around the pond in her boots and her father John (Donald Sutherland) at work inside, examining a projected image of an Italian cathedral he intends to restore. The cutting works as suspense, leaving the audience utterly helpless to stop this inevitable tragedy from happening, but it has a much more sophisticated agenda than goosing our emotions. Through color and montage effects, tied to shots like a spill that bleeds over John’s slide, Roeg dramatizes the present and predicts the future all at once, signaling the heartbreak and terror to come.</p><p>Time collapses in Don’t Look Now.

<p>If the shorter days and cooler nights are urging you to turn on the oven, try these recipes including courgette, feta and tarragon tart,  and olive and pine-nut buns</p><p>The oven is on and all is well. Darker evenings – and this is just the start – make me hungry for cake, for buns and for biscuits. Treats to brighten an autumn afternoon too, when we come in from a walk or from sweeping fallen leaves from the paths. Something to eat with a cup of tea.</p><p>I made buns this week, their soft, almost yellow crumb speckled with chopped green olives and spiked with toasted pine nuts. The latter cost a king’s ransom, but once they are toasted their nuttiness goes a long way. You only need a handful. There was a tart too, its pastry flaky and uneven, the filling scented with tarragon and choc-a-bloc with grated courgettes and craggy lumps of feta.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/oct/16/pistachio-and-lemon-cake-and-more-nigel-slaters-fruit-and-nut-bakes">Continue rea

The world is at war, cities are aflame and a Lancaster bomber is falling from the sky. Inside the burning cockpit, squadron leader Peter Carter gives his name and age then outlines his politics. “Conservative by nature,” he says. “Labour by experience.” Played by David Niven, the hero of A Matter of Life and Death is your emblematic Englishman – in that he is a muddle. He is trad and prog, romantic and practical, and amiably optimistic even in the teeth of disaster (and perhaps then most of all). He is describing himself as the plane goes down. By proxy, he is describing the film-makers Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, too.</p><p>All great films are essentially mongrels, created by people from different backgrounds and

<p>The only masking that’s going on is that of the government’s continued failure to get to grips with the virus</p><p>For some people, going to hospital may now be more dangerous than staying at home untreated.

Of course, there have always been dangers where sick people gather. But, until now, health services have sought to minimise them.

We were introduced in the basement kitchen of 18 Folgate Street, the 18th-century townhouse in London’s Spitalfields he’d lived in since 1979 , which now bears his name. Severs eyed me up from the Victorian cooking range as a tube train thundered beneath our feet, so close it seemed it might burst through the floor.

<p>Getting ill shouldn’t be expensive. But for many patients, being diagnosed with cancer can be a financial catastrophe. Hilary Osborne looks at why</p><p>As the Guardian’s money and consumer editor, <strong>Hilary Osborne</strong> is used to thinking about the financial consequences of every life event. But when she was diagnosed with breast cancer she assumed the cost of it would be the last thing on her mind.</p><p>Instead she discovered that being ill had hidden costs – ones that pushed many women into financial catastophe. She spoke to women such as Stevie who, because she could no longer work and was struggling to access benefits, was worried about how she would even keep herself warm during her cancer treatment.
