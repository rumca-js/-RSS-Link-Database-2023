Increased salinity usually spells trouble for freshwater insects like mayflies. A new study from North Carolina State University finds that the lack of metabolic responses to salinity may explain why some freshwater insects often struggle in higher salinity, while other freshwater invertebrates (like mollusks and crustaceans) thrive. Salinity in this case refers to the concentrations of all the salts in an aquatic environment, not just sodium.

Changes in the mechanical properties of cells are among the earliest signs of development of a cancer. Until now, one of the major obstacles to the use of mechanics in cancer diagnosis has been the lack of a standardized measurement procedure that would guarantee reproducibility and reliability of results. Thanks to European scientific cooperation involving the Institute of Nuclear Physics of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Cracow, this obstacle has now been removed.

Bewick's swans fly less far during their autumn migration when the weather is warm. Climate change has therefore led to a shift in their common wintering areas. Now, for the first time, bird researchers from the University of Amsterdam (UvA) and the Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW) have been able to use long-term GPS data to pinpoint the specific choices that individual swans make. The results of their research were published today, Oct. 5,  in the journal Global Change Biology.

A very rare, strange burst of extraordinarily bright light in the universe just got even strangerâ€”thanks to the eagle-eye of the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope. The phenomenon, called a Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transient (LFBOT), flashed onto the scene where it wasn't expected to be found, far away from any host galaxy. Only Hubble could pinpoint its location. The Hubble results suggest astronomers know even less about these objects than previously thought by ruling out some possible theories.

Industry 4.0 requires simple solutions for complex functions. Optical sensors, such as pinhole cameras, can deliver a depth of focus and reasonable resolution, but they suffer from low intensity for reliable and fast imaging. This requires a long exposure time, which sacrifices fast imaging capability and limits their real-world usage in self-driving cars.

Johannesburg and its surrounds, at the center of the industrial heartland of South Africa, have been hit by severe water cuts. Water interruptions have been happening for years, but they have been scaled up dramatically in recent weeks. The deteriorating situation recently forced the Minister of Water and Sanitation, Senzo Mchunu, to intervene. On 27 September he announced a new initiativeâ€”"water-shifting". The proposal has echoes of "load-shedding," the term used for the planned power outages which have become a common feature of life for all South Africans. Anja du Plessis, a water management expert, explains the new water initiative.

Each October, the Nobel Prizes celebrate a handful of groundbreaking scientific achievements. And while many of the awarded discoveries revolutionize the field of science, some originate in unconventional places. For George de Hevesy, the 1943 Nobel Laureate in chemistry who discovered radioactive tracers, that place was a boarding house cafeteria in Manchester, U.K., in 1911.

Cetaceans are the best-known fully aquatic animals, including whales, dolphins and porpoises. The group includes more than 90 existing species, divided into baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti). Toothed whales are so named because all species in this family possess teeth. Among them, the distribution and ecology of genus Mesoplodon are little known, because they typically live offshore in the ocean and rarely surface.

At the same time, the question arises: What role should artificial life play in our environment here on Earth, where all life forms are created by nature and have their own place and purpose?

They usually originate in warmer regions closer to the equatorâ€”a phenomenon that could be exacerbated by climate change.

As anyone who has ever skimmed a book or magazine can tell you, sometimes you don't have to read every word to grasp the essence. Inspired by this notion, scientists are harnessing the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to enable a form of "speed reading" in microscopy. This could revolutionize the way researchers acquire data and allow them to preserve the integrity of precious samples.

However, in the ocean, there exists a remarkable group of small, worm-like animals called acoels that do both; some acoels form relationships (symbiosis) with single-celled, photosynthetic microalgae.
