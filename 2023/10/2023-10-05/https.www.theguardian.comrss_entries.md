It was a fitting end to his speakership, one in which McCarthy had served only at the pleasure of a nihilistic bloc of far-right Republicans.

<p>The last word, our series about emotions in books, focuses on depictions of isolation this month, from a memoir of grief to Sam Selvon’s Windrush chronicle</p><p>Lonely, as words go, is a bit of a loner. As the critic Christopher Ricks writes, it pleasingly has “only” one rhyme, and no real synonyms. After all, being alone and being lonely are quite different things. For all this, poets and writers, from Audre Lorde to Philip Larkin, have made much of loneliness, drawn to the challenge of bringing us close to an emotion whose very nature is to stay at a distance.</p><p>Some lonely renderings turn out to be a bit of a sham. Records show that when Wordsworth “wandered lonely as a cloud”, his sister Dorothy was strolling companionably beside him, and she liked the daffodils too. Thoreau’s standing as the poster-boy of solitude, living “alone” and “Spartan like” by Walden Pond, starts to unravel when one actually reads his book, which contains a hefty chapter on “Visitors”.

<p>Broader implications of Kevin McCarthy’s removal as House speaker are becoming clear</p><p>Good morning, US politics blog readers. Not 48 hours after the House of Representatives was paralyzed by a far-right revolt that ousted <strong>Kevin McCarthy</strong> from the speaker’s chair, the broader implications are becoming clear. Leaderless, the chamber is in disarray, but lawmakers nonetheless have crucial work to do. One of McCarthy’s last acts was passing a deal to prevent a government shutdown that would have begun this last Sunday, but the bill funds the government only till 17 November. That is more than a month away, but Congress is riven with divisions over government spending, and the House’s present dysfunction robs lawmakers of time to address them.</p><p>Then there’s the prospects for continued American aid to Ukraine. That, too, must be approved by Congress, and while senators of both parties appear open to continuing to help Kyiv, House conservatives are opposed, with

She plays Lily, who has everything a woman could ask for but also amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Sarandon breathes life into a character who is physically out of gas and now wants to leave the world on a high. You can hear wariness in Lily’s voice, every time she talks to her “difficult” daughter, Anna (Mia Wasikowska). The resentment and hostility (as well as love) between Lily and Anna could fuel a whole other, better movie.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/oct/05/susan-sarandons-20-best-performances-ranked">Continue reading...</a>

## Cry, the Beloved Country review – utterly absorbing tale from the birth of apartheid

<p>Zoltan Korda’s 1951 adaptation of Alan Paton’s crusading novel is filled with passion and moral fortitude</p><p>Zoltan Korda’s thrilling movie version of Alan Paton’s novel was first released in 1951, when South Africa’s racist apartheid policy was only three years of age and maybe enough of a novelty to be thought of as something amenable to second thoughts, capable of being reformed or even abolished. Paton’s novel itself was published in 1948, the same year as apartheid appeared. Now this film is rereleased, revealing again that it has a crusading preacher’s urgency and moral seriousness, appropriate for a story of priests.</p><p>After a slow start, the movie hits a muscular, compelling stride; it is a drama with an obvious biblical parallel, but also a quite genuine Shakespearean resonance in the tragic dimension of its final act and the Montague/Capulet reconciliation it envisions for black and white, bought with the self-sacrificial forgiveness for a capital crime.

Sweat made a snail-like progress down my neck – but I didn’t care. My swishy, three-quarter-length coat was half my personality. They would have had to surgically remove it from me.

I wanted booze and drugs, and to cause outrage in provincial tearooms. In fact, I just looked like a dick, and wouldn’t have known weed from oregano.

<p>Erik ten Hag is not blaming defeats on absent players or bad form but the club is taking steps to improve the injury list</p><p>“No excuses” is the admirable mantra of Erik ten Hag as the manager surveys the wreckage of Manchester United’s early season. In football it is an adage applied unequivocally to injuries and illnesses: never cite the players unavailable as the reason for bad results because you will be cast as weak and lacking the imagination to navigate the alternative route to success with those you do have.</p><p>Like all truisms there is a limit. For Ten Hag to have 16 of his first-team squad go down at some point for the 10 games so far is the non-negotiable prevailing factor in United’s dismal form. The number is close to two- thirds of the 25-man Premier League squad clubs name each September for the opening half of the season.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/05/rasmus-hojlund-the-only-beacon-of-hope-uniteds-struggles-go-on">Continue read

And to whom?”</p><p>Beyond the Page will feature more than 170 artworks, including miniature paintings going back to the mid-16th century and the responses of 20th- and 21st-century artists – from south Asia and beyond – to these works, and to the form in general. Not that “miniature” is a “terribly agreed term”, says Nasar. “It’s a bit like when people say ‘the Middle East’: the middle of where?

<p>Celebration of the legendary New York hotel and haven for actors, artists and musicians that spills secrets of squalor, celebrity and death</p><p>Earlier this year saw the release of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/18/dreaming-walls-review-chelsea-hotels-window-on-last-days-of-bohemia">Dreaming Walls</a>, an interesting if meanderingly vague film about New York’s legendary Hotel Chelsea; the place which is actually an apartment building and artist colony, famous for residents and habitués including Andy Warhol, Sid Vicious, Isadora Duncan, Dylan Thomas and Arthur Miller. That rather downbeat film emphasised the efforts of longterm residents to stay in the building after it was bought by new owners who allegedly wanted to sanitise and gentrify it. Here is a second documentary which is far more celebratory, with far more interviewees, far more sexy name-dropping and more uproarious anecdotes, especially about the friendly ghosts who allegedly roam its corridors.</
