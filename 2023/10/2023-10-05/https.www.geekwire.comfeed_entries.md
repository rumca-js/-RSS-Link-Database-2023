Epic, headquartered in Raleigh, N.C., is arguably best-known as the developer behind the popular online shooter Fortnite. It’s also the creator of an eponymous digital storefront for PC games and the publisher of the Unreal Engine, a high-end toolkit for game development and 3D modeling. On Sept. 28, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney notified employees via an internal email, later posted to Epic’s public blog, that Epic would lay off “around&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/epic-games-layoffs-hit-its-seattle-area-office-affecting-39-employees/">Read More</a>

Despite an ongoing pause in the construction of numerous new Bellevue office buildings, announced last year, Amazon now has more than 1,000 employees working in 555 Tower in the city east of Seattle, the company confirmed. Commercial real estate website CoStar News first reported on the development. Amazon said it has completed full construction up to the 19th floor at the 42-story 555 Tower, and is still waiting to proceed with the interior buildout of the&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/amazon-begins-shifting-2000-employees-from-seattle-to-new-bellevue-office-towers/">Read More</a>

The idea is to go beyond generic AI chatbots to create a true personal agent that leverages the company&#8217;s unique data set and the inferred preferences of individual users, said Ian Morris, the Likewise CEO, in an interview Thursday morning. For example, if someone uses Pix to search for horror movies on Hulu,&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/bill-gates-backed-likewise-launches-ai-powered-pix-personal-entertainment-companion/">Read More</a>

The company confirmed the layoffs in response to a GeekWire inquiry Wednesday, citing a restructuring to align with growth investment areas. The startup now has about 200 employees. SeekOut is still hiring and plans to reach 225 employees by year-end. The company raised $115 million last year, pushing its valuation past $1.2 billion, making it one of Seattle&#8217;s so-called &#8220;unicorn&#8221; startups. It&#8217;s one of several Seattle unicorns to reduce headcount amid the broader tech slowdown.

A lot has happened since then in his beloved burg. What would he say about Seattle now? Last night, in a moment of (perhaps misguided) inspiration, I asked ChatGPT this very question, providing links to the day&#8217;s coverage in GeekWire and asking the generative AI engine to write a column in Watson&#8217;s voice and style, assessing the modern-day goings-on in his hometown. Here&#8217;s what it came up with (with links to the relevant stories added manually for reference).

Those are two of the takeaways from the latest study on phone fraud and spam by Seattle startup&#160;Hiya.&#160; Spam is defined as unwanted calls from non-contacts, and includes both fraud calls and nuisance calls. In its report Thursday, Hiya said that in the first half of 2023, the phone security startup observed more than 98 billion incoming calls worldwide. Twenty percent of unidentified calls were flagged as spam, 5% as fraud, and 75% were&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/fake-amazon-calls-and-the-use-of-generative-ai-highlight-startups-phone-scam-report/">Read More</a>
