In today's Daily Fix:
Rockstar's latest port of Red Dead Redemption was met with criticism for being locked at 30fps on modern consoles, but a new patch just casually dropped a 60fps update without much fanfare. The catch? It's currently PS5-only, so if you bought the latest version on Switch or Xbox Series, you're still stuck with 30fps for now. PS5 owners are also getting first dibs on the upcoming Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 multiplayer beta, which goes live October 6 until October 8. And we take a look at the current Pringles Icons leaderboard.
