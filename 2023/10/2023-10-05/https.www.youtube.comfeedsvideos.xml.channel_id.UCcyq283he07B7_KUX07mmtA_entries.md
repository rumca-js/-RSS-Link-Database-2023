Many newcomers to investing want to match their investments to the things they care about – but don’t always know where to start. To create a space for these conversations, Fidelity presents “Bright Ideas,” a new talk show all about illuminating a path to increased confidence with investing. Join host Rod Thill as he kicks off the series with a focus on sustainable investing. Rod welcomes special guests Anna White, a sustainable investing analyst at Fidelity, and ESG consultant Jamie Bechtel, for a fun discussion about what it actually means to invest sustainably and how to make it a social exercise linked to things you already know and care about.
