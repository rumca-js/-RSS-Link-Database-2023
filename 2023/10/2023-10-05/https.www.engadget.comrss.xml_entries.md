<p>Tracking your fitness and health just got easier if you use <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-01-07-myfitnesspal-restaurant-logging.html"><ins>MyFitnessPal</ins></a> and Google's Wear OS. The MyFitnessPal smartwatch app offers a way to keep track of your health stats, including calorie intake and gym gains. While this worked well, it has also been limited since you couldn't edit or input your data directly on your wearable device. However, the latest app update changes things for the better.</p>
<p>In a recent <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://blog.myfitnesspal.com/track-what-matters-to-you-on-your-watch/"><ins>blog post</ins></a>, MyFitnessPal announced updates that will make tracking and logging easier on Wear OS. Now, users can track and log without pulling out their phones. When wearing compatible Android smartwatches, users will have access to new watch tiles and complications — which will give them the ability to log foods they eat reg

<p>Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney says the company is adjusting Unreal Engine pricing for non-gaming developers in fields like film / TV and automotive. “We haven’t officially announced this, but in the interest of transparency, we want to put it out there,” Sweeney said in a presentation from Unreal Fest 2023 <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://twitter.com/ImmatureGamerX/status/1709216675730542972?s=20">posted on X</a> (formerly Twitter) by @ImmatureGamerX (<a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/epic-games-to-update-unreal-engine-pricing-for-devs-outside-game-industry">via</a> <em>Game Developer</em>).

<p>The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (KVA) has <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.kva.se/en/news/the-nobel-prize-in-chemistry-2023/">chosen</a> its 2023 Nobel Prize in Chemistry winners, and they’re all about quantum dots. The three researchers — Alexei I. Ekimov, Louis E. Brus and Moungi G. Bawendi — will share the honors for their contributions to nanotechnology.</p>
<p>Although quantum dots had been proposed theoretically earlier in the 20th century, this year’s trio of Nobel winners began verifying them experimentally. The nanoscale semiconductor particles exhibit quantum mechanical properties, glowing in different colors when exposed to light. “Quantum dots have many fascinating and unusual properties. Importantly, they have different colours depending on their size,” wrote Johan Åqvist, Chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry, in a press release. The smaller the dot, the bluer its light is; the bigger the dot, the redder its light is. By changing their size,

The news should be of particular interest for Steam Deck owners. It was already possible to jump through the hoops required to get the game running on the portable console, but this will radically streamline the process.</p>
<p>Valve hasn’t rated the game for Steam Deck compatibility, but that’ll likely happen closer to launch. Additionally, you’ll still need a Battle.net account to get started, so have those login credentials ready. Just like the Battle.net release, standalone PCs require at least an Intel Core i5 or AMD FX-8350 CPU and 8 GB of RAM, though 16 GB is preferred, to get this running.</p>

<p>First, if you have any existing Notification Center widgets you’d rather put on the desktop, you can now drag them over directly. They’ll move seamlessly back and forth between the two places, and you can reposition them around the desktop to find a spot you like.</p>

It’s working on fusing Assistant and Bard AI together. During a demo, Google showed the Assistant pulling details from a party invite in Gmail. Ask where the party is, and Assistant with Bard can tell you the location and tap into Google Maps for directions. While you’d be able to ask for directions in the past, now the Assistant can pull the address from other contexts.</p>
<p>You could chat to Bard to whip up a meal plan with a grocery list and export that to Google Docs or Gmail without a keyboard or copy and paste. There’s no release date yet, but Google says Assistant with Bard is coming soon to Android and iOS.</p>

<p>Samsung has unveiled the SmartTag 2, an AirTag-like tracking device that's a successor to the original <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-smart-tag-bluetooth-tile-uwb-150004059.html">SmartTag released in 2021</a>. Unlike the original, which had both Bluetooth and ultra-wideband (UWB) variants, the new version will combine both features in a single model. The primary drawback is that it still only works with Samsung smartphones.</p>
<p>The new model sports an all-new ring-shaped design, with metal on the inside of the ring for durability, rather than just having a punch-hole as before. That lets it work better with accessories like clips and keyrings, or attach to bags and luggage. It's now IP67 dust and water resistant as well, letting you do things like track pets outside.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Amazon's Kuiper satellites will soon make their debut in orbit. The company is <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/innovation-at-amazon/project-kuiper-prototype-satellite-test-mission">gearing up to deploy</a> its first two satellites, the KuiperSat-1 and the KuiperSat-2, for its Protoflight mission that's scheduled to launch on October 6. Project Kuiper is Amazon's answer to SpaceX's Starlink service. At the moment, its plans entail launching 3,200 satellites over the next six years to form a constellation that can provide internet connectivity even to far-flung places traditional providers can't reach.</p>

<p>Posts on X might look quite different, especially if you mainly follow news and media publications.

Back then, website owner Elon Musk said that the idea came from him directly and that it will &quot;greatly improve the [platform's] esthetics.&quot; We tested it out by posting one of our stories, and only the article's image with an overlay of its URL show up when it's viewed on iOS. On the web, we still see the article snippet and a truncated version of its headline.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Advertisers reportedly didn't like the new format when they were shown a preview of it, but the change is clearly still pushing through. X's main reason for the format switch is apparently to make posts look more compact by fitting mo
