Clash of the Titans in 2010, coming off the heels of Sam Worthington’s success in Avatar, made enough money to justify a sequel. Was anyone really asking for one? No. But we got one anyway in glorious 3D! Remember that craze?

Wrath of the Titans definitely raises some questions. Like why didn’t Zeus revive Perseus’ wife again? Why are all these gods made of sand? What’s Andromeda tagging along for? Why are fire-breathing creatures hurt by fire? Does being inside an exploding Titan not hurt at all?

To answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to John Wrath of the Titans!
