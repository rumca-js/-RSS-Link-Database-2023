Telltale Games, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/investors-announce-plans-to-revive-telltale-games">resurrected</a> studio behind the likes of The Expanse: A Telltale Series and the upcoming The Wolf Among Us 2, has confirmed layoffs at the studio, after a former employee shared a message on social media claiming "most of" his team had been let go last month.
</p><p>
News of layoffs at Telltale began circulating after cinematic artist Jonah Huang - who's worked at the studio in both its current and original incarnation, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-walking-dead-developer-telltale-games-reportedly-lays-off-the-majority-of-its-staff">closed down in 2018</a> - <a href="https://x.com/jjonahjonahson/status/1709979363608039784?s=20">claimed</a> the studio "laid most of us off early September".

It feels like forever ago that For the King 2 - the sequel to IronOak Games' wonderful tabletop-RPG-meets-digital-board-game adventure - was announced (it was actually about 18 months ago, it turns out), but it finally has a release date and is coming to Steam on 2nd November.
</p><p>
For the King 2, which is set some 20 years after the events of the first game, promises another bout of optionally co-operative rogue-like adventuring - this time for up to four pals both locally and online - as players take on the kingdom of Fahrul's tyrannical queen. 
</p><p>
Everything shown so far suggests the sequel is more about refinement than radical reinvention, meaning you should expect the same blend of familiar RPG staples - dungeon crawling, questing, turn-based exploration and combat, loot acquisition, and so on - with some neat stor

## Bungie sued for retaliation and wrongful termination by former HR manager

Bungie is being sued by a former HR manager who claims she was fired from the Destiny 2 developer after raising a potential case of racial discrimination with her supervisors.
</p><p>
As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-bungie-hr-manager-is-suing-for-wrongful-termination-after-she-reported-potential-racial-bias">reported by IGN</a>, former Bungie HR manager Ingrid Alm - who joined the studio in May 2022 - filed a complaint in the state of Washington earlier this year, citing retaliation and wrongful termination. Alm alleges she was fired from Bungie after being asked to investigate a Black employee, referred to as "James Smith" in court documents - who responded by saying he felt he was being racially targeted by his supervisor.
</p><p>
As a result, Alm recommended Smith's supervisor receive diversity training, but

Just a week after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eldritch-fishing-horror-dredge-delays-the-iron-rig-paid-expansion-into-2024">announcing</a> it was delaying fishing horror Dredge's first paid expansion, The Iron Rig, into 2024, developer Black Salt Games has unveiled an entirely different paid expansion, The Pale Reach, which arrives on 16th November.
</p><p>
The Pale Reach plots a course for a "new, frozen frontier", where players will need to navigate treacherous icy canyons - soon also likely to succumb to the malevolence seen elsewhere in the game - following the trail of a long-forgotten expedition to see what became of its crew.
</p><p>
It's a trip that'll first require players to equip their boat with specialised gear capable of smashing through the ice, and once the voyage is underway, there'll be new

Cyberpunk 2077 is on a bit of a roll at the moment. Following its recently released Phantom Liberty expansion and the base game's extensive 2.0 update, developer CD Projekt Red has announced a partnership with Anonymous Content to develop a brand-new, live-action story set in the world of Cyberpunk 2077. I wonder if they will bring Idris Elba and Keanu Reeves back for the occasion?
</p><p>
This live-action project is still in the very early stages of development, with the studios involved still on the hunt for a screenwriter to take the lead.
</p><p>
While the search continues, several members from media company Anonymous Content have been confirmed to be on board. Garrett Kemble, David Levine, Ryan Schwartz, and Bard Dorros will all be part of this project's production, which CDPR said will be develope

However, expectations have evolved too, especially on PC where the racing genre has set new heights for visual excellence and ray-traced effects with series like F1 and Forza Horizon. AAA PC gaming over the past two years has also seen plenty of disastrous releases, with a bad user experience and stutters out of the gate. In this review of the PC version of Forza Motorsport, we'll examine how the game meets those expectations, whether it stutters, how the PC and Xbox versions compare and the best settings to use for an optimised experience. </p><p>Before we get into comparisons and optimised settings, let's start with the user experience - and that all-important sha

After a decidedly rocky launch almost three years ago, CD Projekt Red has announced that Cyberpunk 2077 has now sold 25m copies. 
</p><p>
This latest figure comes hot on the heels of the game's Phantom Liberty expansion, and that rather hefty 2.0 update that added new content to the base game. 
</p><p>
The news was welcomed with many congratulating the developer on its latest milestone.

Earlier this week, Rockstar quietly added a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-adds-60fps-to-red-dead-redemption-on-ps5">60fps toggle to Red Dead Redemption on PlayStation 5</a>. The game, which was released back in August for both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-coming-to-ps4-and-nintendo-switch-later-this-month">PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch</a>, can be played on PS5 thanks to backwards compatibility. And now, that little toggle gives PlayStation 5 users a new framerate to play around with while exploring the Wild West. 
</p><p>
However, there are some Xbox Series X/S players who are now feeling rather left out by Rockstar, asking where their 60fps Red Dead Redemption port is.

When Rockstar brought Red Dead Redemption to PlayStation 4 and Switch, it directed its Xbox communi

I&rsquo;m jumping to a new planet in Starfield and my space cowboy companion Sam Coe needs to have a serious conversation. He launches into a long story about his estranged partner but he&rsquo;s facing the wrong way. Stuck on a ladder in the middle of my ship, he tells his sad tale to a blank wall.
</p><p>
Restarting the conversation helps a little. Sam is looking at me now, but his mouth and eyebrows are operating on different wavelengths. Occasionally his face settles on a recognisable expression, but the in-between moments - as he reorganises his wayward features - are deeply strange. All the while he stands stock-still and completely upright, like a toy soldier stuck in his plastic packaging. 
</p><p>
Like all of Starfield&rsquo;s characters, he does not touch anything, or anyone. He does not eat. He does not use the bath

Blizzard has apologised as its server Battle.net is currently unavailable, leaving players unable to access games, such as Diablo 4, on PC.

The company is in the process of investigating the cause of today's outages, which is said to have been caused by an issue with authentication servers.  Blizzard said this may result in "failed or slow login attempts" for its games.
</p><p>
"We apologise for the inconvenience...  we're working to resolve this ASAP" a post on Blizzard's Customer Support social media page states.

Diablo 4 is coming to Steam on 17th October, following a period of Battle.net PC exclusivity.

"We want to break down barriers to make it easier for wanderers everywhere to defend Sanctuary," Blizzard proclaimed in a new post detailing Diablo 4's move to an additional PC platform. 
</p><p>
Those looking to play Blizzard's latest Diablo release on Steam will still need to connect to a Battle.net account, something that is also the case across other platforms. Blizzard explained this will enable players to get access to features like cross-platform play and "more".

When Horizon Forbidden West: Complete Edition is released, it will be the first two disc PlayStation 5 game.

A <a href="https://twitter.com/DoesItPlay1/status/1709486248048423235/photo/1">social media post</a> showing the back of the Complete Edition's box reveals that the physical copy of the game will be shipped on two blu-ray discs. Users will need to ensure they have plenty of free space before cracking on with Aloy's latest outings, as a minimum of 121GB is required for installation.
</p><p>
While Aloy's escapades across America will be the first game to release across two discs on PlayStation 5, it won't be the only title to do so. Earlier this year, Square Enix revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-is-so-big-its-on-two-discs">Final Fantasy 7 Reb
