According to <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-8-face-unlock-3370970/">several</a> sources, the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro use AI and machine learning in their selfie cameras to enable secure Face Unlock at the highest Android biometric class requirements.

Its Class 3 biometric security rating means it is unlikely to be tricked into unlocking by an image or a face that is not the registered user’s. It means banking apps and other payment platforms such as PayPal can exploit Face Unlock for sign-in and authentication on the Pixel 8 – a step up from the Class 1 rated <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202210/google-pixel-7-suppor

		King Saud University has been awarded a <a href="https://ppubs.uspto.gov/pubwebapp/external.html?q=(11762969).pn.&amp;type=ids">patent</a> for an architecture of multi-resolution iris recognition software intended to provide better security and performance than existing systems.

The system is claimed to use a "multi-algorithm, multi-biometric, and multi-instance" approach to processing data extracted from the periocular region around the iris, as well as the iris itself.

The performance of the deep learning-based iris matching is improved by the software being able to work around multiple "challenging issues of unconstrained imaging environments" through “advanced feature representation techniques such as multi-resolution image analysis, fine-tuning, transfer learning

		It turns out that all humans might just be books that can be accurately judged – by AI – for neuroticism and romantic compatibility.

A study <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9420736">published</a> in the Journal IEEE Access reportedly found that one's personality can be "reliably predicted" at least 70 percent of the time using facial recognition software.

Five Chinese researchers say their algorithm accurately classified static images of people according using the so-called big five personality traits: neuroticism, extroversion, openness, agreeableness and conscientiousness. Accuracy was judged against subjects' self-reporting.

The results are based on a dataset of 13,347 pairs of face images and personality traits created by the researchers. A deep neu
