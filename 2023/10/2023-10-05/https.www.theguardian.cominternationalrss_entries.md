<p>The critically acclaimed author is the first ever laureate in the prize’s history to write in Nynorsk and his win marks a further step in the playwright and novelist’s rise as a cultural powerhouse</p><p>• <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/oct/05/jon-fosse-wins-the-2023-nobel-prize-in-literature">Jon Fosse wins the 2023 Nobel prize in literature</a></p><p>This year’s winner of the Nobel prize in literature, Norwegian author Jon Fosse, was one of the bookies’ frontrunners and has been considered a serious contender for a good decade.</p><p>Yet when the Nobel Committee’s permanent secretary Mats Malm read out Fosse’s name, it still came as a surprise. A day beforehand Swedish critic Agri Ismaïl said the possibility of a win for the Norwegian playwright would be: “Too obvious”. The Swedish academy had defied bookies’ predictions and wrongfooted critics too many times in the past, and if there was one consensus in the run-up, it was that the prize would not go to Europe,

<p>Tickled director David Farrier started investigating the man clamping cars in his neighborhood, and ended up in a toxic film-maker-subject relationship</p><p>It’s been 10 years since David Farrier, a New Zealand journalist and documentarian, first heard about his neighborhood car menace. In 2013, a coworker tearfully reported that she accidentally parked her car in the lot for a store called Bashford Antiques, in the Auckland neighborhood of Ponsonby (which Farrier describes as “the Beverly Hills of Auckland”), only to return to a tow truck with a pugilistic operator and a steep ransom. After hours of negotiation, she paid $250 for her car.</p><p>At the time, there was no cap on the amount one could demand for a car parked on private property, and the people at Bashford Antiques were especially enthusiastic exploiters. Clamping – in which someone arrests the wheels of an easily misparked car for a ransom of hundreds of dollars – became a routine sport at the nondescript suburban s
