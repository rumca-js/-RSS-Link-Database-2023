  <p id="q3hpsK"><em>Totally Killer</em> never tries to hide what it is: a classic slasher movie fused with <em>Back to the Future</em>.

If you’re looking for a nostalgia-laced slasher to stream ahead of Halloween, this is it.</p>

This $3,000 4K OLED TV has swappable batteries that power the screen — and also a vacuum suction system that can keep the display adhered to walls without traditional mounting. And it can stick to virtually any surface, including ceramic and glass. At the time, there were valid questions about what would happen to the 55-inch TV whenever those batteries became fully depleted. Would it just... fall off the wall and come tumbling to the ground? </p>
