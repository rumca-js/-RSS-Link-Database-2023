This year’s remake of Resident Evil 4 did a phenomenal job recapturing what made the original so beloved while also making some changes that kept it feeling exciting and fresh, but considering the size of Capcom and Shinji Mikami’s 2005 classic, it wasn’t surprising that a few sections didn’t make the cut… but thankfully, it looks like they were saved for the recently released Separate Ways DLC, which follows Ada Wong as she has her own set of adventures that mirror Leon’s, while also exploring new areas and encountering a slew of new horrors. Really, this game nailed it.

## High on Life: High on Knife DLC Review

High On Life: High On Knife reviewed on Xbox Series X by Travis Northup. Also available on PC and PlayStation 5.

High on Knife is a decent add-on for those searching for an excuse to jump back into Squanch Games’ gross world of naughty words and cartoon violence, but it doesn’t offer a whole lot of reasons to stick around for more than a couple of hours. With a disappointingly short questline and an ill-advised focus on some of the weaker members of the High on Life cast, it doesn’t come close to reaching the same highs (pun intended) as it did last year. There are certainly some decent laughs to be had, and more of this shamelessly idiotic world is by no means a bad thing, but there just isn’t enough here for me to be able to enthusiastically recommend anyone clear even this small amount of time on their busy gaming schedule.
