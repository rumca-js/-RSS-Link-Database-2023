A team of researchers has discovered that dormant tumor cells surviving chemotherapy can be targeted through the inhibition of a specific protein called P-glycoprotein (P-gp). This discovery opens up new possibilities for delaying relapse and is particularly relevant for aggressive triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), for which there are currently few effective treatments.

## Engineering study employs deep learning to explain extreme events

At the core of uncovering extreme events such as floods is the physics of fluids – specifically turbulent flows. Researchers leveraged a computer-vision deep learning technique and adapted it for nonlinear analysis of extreme events in wall-bounded turbulent flows, which are pervasive in numerous physics and engineering applications and impact wind and hydrokinetic energy, among others. Results show the technique employed can be invaluable for accurately identifying the sources of extreme events in a completely data-driven manner.

Researchers identified and characterized a new cellular compartment in vertebrate cells termed chr('39')exclusomechr('39') that might be a precursor of today’s eucaryotic nucleus. The study reveals that mammalian cells recognize, cluster, sort and keep extrachromosomal DNA -- like transfected plasmid DNA and endogenous circular DNAs originating from telomeres of the chromosome -- away from chromosomal DNA. That suggests that there is a cell autonomous genome defense system.

If forensic experts have access to a suspect’s gun, they can compare the microscopic markings from discarded shell casings with those found at a crime scene. Finding and reporting a mismatch can help free the innocent, just as a match can incriminate the guilty. But new research reveals mismatches are more likely than matches to be reported as “inconclusive” in cartridge-case comparisons.
