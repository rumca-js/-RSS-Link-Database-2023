<p>Far-right congressman files motion after expressing outrage at speaker’s bipartisan effort to avoid government shutdown</p><p>Congressman Matt Gaetz, a hard-right Republican of Florida, introduced a motion to remove Kevin McCarthy as House speaker on Monday, expressing outrage over the Republican leader’s successful efforts to avoid a government shutdown this weekend.</p><p>The announcement comes two days after the House passed a stopgap spending bill to extend government funding through 17 November, averting a shutdown that could have forced hundreds of thousands of federal workers to go without pay. Both the House and the Senate passed the bill, known as a continuing resolution, with overwhelming bipartisan majorities before Joe Biden signed the bill late on Saturday evening.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/oct/02/matt-gaetz-remove-kevin-mccarthy-speaker-government-shutdown">Continue reading...</a>

He had leukemia. There was a campaign at Hertha to find the right blood match for him. But Union also did this, and the club set up a blood station at a home game. More than 500 of our fans queued up that day to donate blood to this guy.”</p><p>It is a little anecdote that illustrates Union’s ethos and the importance of community, even with rivals. Winning is not the most important measure of success in this pocket of east Berlin, although there has been rather a lot of that recently.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/02/the-club-whose-fans-literally-bleed-for-it-prepares-to-grace-the-biggest-stage">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After a year in government, Italy's far-right prime minister has not followed through with her electoral pledge to halt 'illegal' migration. But she has carved an influential role for herself on the theme of immigration in Europe and has used it to her advantage, the Guardian's Rome correspondent, Angela Giuffrida, explains.</p><p></p><p>Italy is at the centre of migration routes to Europe, with more people arriving there than Greece, Malta and Spain. The numbers have increased in the past decade and are expected to rise further.</p><p></p><p>If European leaders remain divided on the matter, and no concrete solutions are reached, Giuffrida says Meloni will use the number of people arriving in order to stir up support for herself and her far-right allies before EU elections in May</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/21/many-faces-of-giorgia-meloni-year-in-power-italy-prime-minister"><strong>‘She plays the moderate but winks at those who are not’: the m

<p>The plot and photography may fall short, but the tension between the two leads gives this horror a racy magnetism</p><p>Adding a racy dose of queer eroticism to the suspenseful dread of the horror film, Alex Birrell’s second feature settles on a familiar location: an isolated cabin nestled in the deep, dark woods. In the throes of a writer’s block, novelist Ben – played by the film’s co-writer, Joshua Tonks – is interrupted by the arrival of Jay Clift’s enigmatic stranger, who might or might not be a murderous sadist.</p><p>With his typewriter and vintage film camera, Ben is a self-professed lover of analogue gadgets. His clean-cut and generic T-shirt-and-jeans look makes for an interesting juxtaposition with his visitor, whose black mane and leather jacket cuts a classic 1970s serial killer figure. While the costuming choices are astute, other aspects of the visuals are forgettable: apart from a few canted POV shots, the cinematic possibilities of the forests and the cabin’s inte

<p>Record crowd but worrying defeat for Arsenal, VAR questions at Chelsea and encouraging starts for Leicester and Brighton</p><p>Arsenal may not be winning on the pitch but they’re winning off it. The Gunners broke the WSL attendance record for a third time with the 54,115 fans at the Emirates Stadium for their 1-0 defeat to Liverpool on Sunday. Arsenal are mastering the art of bringing the supporter base on board with watching the women’s team; the marketing and ticketing teams deserve a huge amount of credit for the numbers coming through the turnstiles. Meanwhile across London, Chelsea could only muster 14,776 for their 2-1 victory over Tottenham. It is staggering that the reigning champions, bidding for a fifth consecutive league title and with a squad stacked with international superstars, cannot get fans to show out in force. Ticket prices rising, with some as high as £50, and the later Sunday kick-off may have impacted numbers. However, there is more to do to build crowds wor

## The UK has over 1000 tax reliefs: why doesn’t the government know how many billions they cost? | Rajiv Prabhakar

<p>You’d think a tax-obsessed Tory party would want to know what these exemptions add up to. We need transparency now</p><p>It is not uncommon for politicians to compare managing the public finances to running a household budget. Hence the frequent statements about greater public borrowing equating to maxing out the nation’s credit card from<strong> </strong>Conservatives such as David Cameron and Rishi Sunak. Of course, this comparison is highly misleading – for a start, governments can raise money in tax and borrow more over a longer period of time.</p><p>But there is another way the comparison falls down. Households generally have an idea of their outgoings and how much money is being spent. But this isn’t the case for government – at least not when it comes to tax relief, the cost of which is often unclear. Tax reliefs are a key part of the tax system. If a person sells their home, they do not have to pay capital gains tax on any rise in value of their property. In 2022 to 2023,

Steve Coogan plays Savile, the DJ and TV presenter who, after his death in 2011, was revealed as a sexual predator. “I got a shiver,” she says. It was the same, years before, whenever she saw Savile appear on TV. “He would make me feel sick. He was creepy, just the most disgusting human being I’ve ever met.

<p>Richarlison takes the eye while City and United have problems to solve after a series of Saturday surprises</p><p>Pre-season is supposedly a duff barometer of the campaign ahead. The main aim is to gain fitness and audition systems of play versus opposition preparing for their own season. Manchester United usually return from the summer money-spinners with a winning record and conscious that the real stuff of the Premier League is about to begin. Yet in the US this summer, Erik ten Hag’s side won only the first game, against Arsenal, and lost to Wrexham, Borussia Dortmund and Real Madrid: to this observer, United’s form was a genuine warning of a misfiring unit and, so far, it has duly struggled - badly. Rasmus Højlund is an apt shorthand for United’s problems: the £64m striker was again starved of chances against Crystal Palace. This has to improve – fast. <strong>Jamie Jackson</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/02/premier-league-10-talking-points

Murdoch has not only divorced his then wife, Wendi Deng, but also married and divorced his fourth wife, Jerry Hall.
