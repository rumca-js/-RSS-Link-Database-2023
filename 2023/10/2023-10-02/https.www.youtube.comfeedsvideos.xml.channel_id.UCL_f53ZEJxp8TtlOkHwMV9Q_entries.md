The roundtable discusses how the consequences of not taking sacrifice seriously in religious practice can include disunity, as well as a lack of living up to the highest ideals. In Exodus 24, sacred space, ritual, and worship all rely on sacrificing in order to be meaningful, and disregarding this importance can lead to a disconnect between people and God.

Episode One will be available on YouTube indefinitely, serving as the gateway to this enlightening exploration. Episodes 2 through 17 will be available for a limited time, so be sure to watch as they release ea
