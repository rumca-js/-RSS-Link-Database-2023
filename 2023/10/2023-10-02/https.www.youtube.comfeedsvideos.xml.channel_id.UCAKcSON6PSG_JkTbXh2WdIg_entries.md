Killer Mike describes overcoming his doubters and critics -- including his own father -- to become a rapper and a leader.

Now, 20 years into a hip-hop career that includes 10 years as part of the acclaimed group Run The Jewels, Killer Mike has released the solo album, 'Michael,' (available on @LomaVistaRecs) so that people would get to know the more personal side of Michael Render, “that little nine-year-old boy on the album cover with the horns and the halo and the buck teeth and the smile.”

Following a session in The Current studio, Killer Mike sat down with host Jill Riley to share his story. You can read a complete transcript of the interview at: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2023/08/16/killer-mike-shares-his-music-and-his-story-michael-album
