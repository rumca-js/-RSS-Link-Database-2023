A major auto strike, the resumption of student-loan repayments, and a shutdown that may yet come back after the stop-gap spending deal lapses, could easily shave a percentage point off GDP growth in the fourth quarter. Add those shocks to other powerful forces at work on the economy — from dwindling pandemic savings to soaring interest rates and now oil prices too — and the combined impact could be enough to tip the US into a downturn as early as this year.

Child marriage is still prevalent due to customs, fear of girls eloping or engaging in premarital sex, and patriarchal constructs. Efforts are being made to raise awareness about the negative consequences of child marriage.

The role of part-time bowlers in cricket has diminished due to evolving dynamics of the game, rule changes, and the rise of power hitters. The limitations on field placements and the requirement for only four fielders outside the thirty-yard circle from overs 11 to 40 have made it difficult for bowlers to be effective. While some top-order batters who bowl finger-spin have had success, relying on part-timers consistently is asking too much in the modern game.
