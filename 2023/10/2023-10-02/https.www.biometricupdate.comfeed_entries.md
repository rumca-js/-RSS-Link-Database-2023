		Synthetic data may address privacy issues with biometric algorithm training, but it must be used carefully in facial recognition training anyway, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/yoonik">Youverse</a> Co-founder and CEO Pedro Torres said during a panel of influential stakeholders brought together by the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/european-association-for-biometrics-eab">EAB</a>.

The EAB’s <a href="https://eab.org/events/program/300">Research Projects Conference 2023</a> concluded with a talk on “Advancing Biometric Technology and ID Management in the EU: Exploring the Need for Testbeds and Sandboxes.” The event took place over three days last week, and featured a series of presentations on advanced biometrics res

		Kenyan officials are stepping up their efforts to purge the East African nation of the Worldcoin project, accusing it of conducting espionage.

An ad hoc parliamentary committee is demanding Kenya's IT regulator terminate digital ID and cryptocurrency-maker Worldcoin’s operations in the country immediately, until stronger rules can be enacted, according to Reuters news agency.

Quoting a report published by the committee, Reuters reported that Kenya should "disable the virtual platforms of Tools for Humanity Corp and Tools for Humanity GmbH Germany (Worldcoin) including blacklisting the IP addresses of related websites."

Several nations have accepted the Worldcoin project, but others, like Kenya have not. There are <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202309/worldcoin-has

		Australia’s long-anticipated national digital identity system is finally moving forward after the government <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202309/australia-unveils-plans-for-universal-digital-id-and-ai-taskforce">presented</a> draft legislation and opened consultations on the system in September. But some experts are warning that the draft Digital ID Bill has a number of issues, while the ID project itself will have to tackle security challenges.

The country’s previous digital ID project, MyGov, is a good illustration of these challenges, says Erica Mealy, a lecturer in Computer Science at the University of the Sunshine Coast, in an <a href="https://theconversation.com/a-national-digital-id-scheme-is-being-proposed-an-expert-weighs-the-pros-and-many-

		Deepfake scams have <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/deepfake-image-scams-rise-experts-say-better-detection-needed-for-darker-skin">been on the rise</a> and identity verification companies are rushing to tackle them. One of them is <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/innovatrics">Innovatrics</a>, which has introduced a new biometric face verification tool against sophisticated identity fraud.

The company’s Video Injection Attack Detection works with its matching algorithms to confirm a user’s identity by comparing their selfie with their ID portrait. At the same time, liveness detection ensures that the user taking the selfie is indeed present and alive, the EU-based biometric solution provider explains in a release.
