There's no shortage of reasons to be excited about the impending launch of Marvel's Spider-Man 2, and though the gameplay side of things naturally takes up a massive chunk of that – thanks to the series' incredible traversal mechanics and combat – just as important (if not more, for many) is the narrative side of things. That's because, over the course of two games, Insomniac has created an incredibly authentic and unique Spider-Man universe, one with excellent characters, writing, and storytelling, all of which has made a great many people very deeply invested in what happens next.

As such, in this three-part series, we're going to recap the events of everything that has happened in the series so far, paving the way and preparing for Marvel's Spider-Man 2. Here, in part one, we're going to focus on the first game.

Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty is a return to form for CD Projekt RED’s futuristic open world action RPG, and for CD Projekt RED itself. The expansion packs in dozens of hours of excellently crafted new content, delivering a gripping story, tight and tense new combat and stealth scenarios, engaging new progression mechanics, and much more. 

All of which is to say that there’s no shortage of highlights littered throughout the expansion. Even so, there are a few quests in Phantom Liberty that are so good that they manage to stand head and shoulders above anything else the expansion has to offer, from main story missions to optional gigs and other side quests. Here, we’re going to talk about a few such quests.

Let's try something for a moment. Close your eyes. Imagine a world where Marvel's Avengers was a single player action-adventure title. In this imaginary world, a solo Avengers game tells a memorable story with well-written characters, expertly crafted set-pieces, and well thought out combat mechanics that properly utilize each playable hero's unique powers and abilities.

Sounds excellent, right? Now open your eyes and come back to reality, because that world is very much not the one we live in. It's been over three years since the launch of Marvel's Avengers, and the game has now officially come to the end of the line.
