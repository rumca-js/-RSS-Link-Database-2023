<p>Kiernan Shipka travels back to the 80s to stop a massacre in an Amazon comedy horror that only offers brief pleasures</p><p>There are echoes of Happy Death Day, Back to the Future and The Final Girls in Amazon’s perky Halloween offering Totally Killer, echoes often loud enough to drown out the film entirely. Its time-travel slasher plot cribs elements from all and relies on enthusiasm over invention to keep us entertained, a gamble that only works in brief bursts. It works best when it’s not funneling all of its energy into a smug wink, self-aware name checks only serving to prove that the film’s three writers have a base level of cine-literacy and want us to know that they’re in on the joke.</p><p>As a comedy horror with a heavy emphasis on the comedy, it could have done with more jokes of its own, never quite nailing a notoriously difficult combination of genres, a laboured mention of Scream only reminding us of its lofty superiority.

A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/30/tottenham-liverpool-premier-league-match-report">logic-defying incident at the Tottenham Hotspur stadium on Saturday</a>, in which the VAR, Darren England, thought he was confirming a goal while actually disallowing it, is likely the greatest calamity to be linked to the technology.

Some argue not, and suggest the technology should be disposed of, an unlikely outcome for a number of reasons; the time and money and reputation already invested being one, the fact refereeing would get demonstrably worse should it be removed, another. Others argue instead for substantial alterations, including the recruitment of referees from abroad and the train

<p>Monaco’s 3-2 win against Marseille this weekend was powered by a group of academy graduates. This feels very familiar</p><p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/ericdevin_">Eric Devin</a> for <a href="http://www.getfootballnewsfrance.com/">Get French Football News</a></p><p>Monaco went into their match against Marseille on Saturday under duress. Yes, the team has looked sharp and motivated this season under Adi Hütter, but circumstances seemed to be conspiring against them. Despite the difficult buildup, though, they played to one of their strengths – their academy, and notably Maghnes Akliouche – and beat Marseille 3-2 and go top of the Ligue 1 table.</p><p>After a blistering start to the season, Monaco had wobbled in their two previous matches.

<p>Leipzig’s abrupt sacking of Max Eberl overshadowed a draw in which both clubs looked in need of better sporting direction</p><p>This weekend’s Top-Spiel did exactly what the showpiece should – to an extent. Saturday’s early-evening Bundesliga match is positioned as the crown jewel of the weekend but even if a gripping draw between Leipzig and Bayern Munich ostensibly ticked all the boxes of entertainment and intrigue, the stomach still continued to rumble afterwards. This was a match and an occasion that, rather than delivering a statement, authored far more questions than answers.</p><p>With all manner of exciting talent on the field at Red Bull Arena this was played under the shadow of Max Eberl, abruptly fired by Leipzig on Friday with the club statement citing a “lack of commitment” which implied to many failing to sufficiently distance himself from speculation linking him with Bayern (whose interest in Eberl, to be clear, far predated his arrival at Leipzig).

<p>We’re pouring money into computer models – but could they lead us astray?</p><p>Predicting the future lies at the heart of responding to climate change. We want to know what things will look like if we take certain actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions – and what they will look like if we don’t. The difference between the two provides the basis for weighing up the various climate policies that might be on the table.</p><p>But we aren’t drawn to predictions just because we’re interested in policy choices. Climate change is scary. We’re now regularly confronted with evidence of its impacts: droughts, heatwaves, wildfires, floods and so on. Predictions provide a peculiar sort of comfort: at least we have some idea of what the outcomes might look like. We can see what’s over the cliff rather than just imagining a void. Faced with the daunting threat of a changing world, it just feels better to know what the future might look like.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/20
