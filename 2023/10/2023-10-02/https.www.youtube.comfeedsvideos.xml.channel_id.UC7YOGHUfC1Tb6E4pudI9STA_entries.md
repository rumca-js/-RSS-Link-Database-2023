In this video I discuss the recent false positive windows defender caused for the Tor browser, and the Unplugged Smartphone developed by Eric Prince and the developer of Pegasus spyware.  It runs a proprietary version of Android as well as proprietary messaging, VPN, antivirus apps, and more.  Due to the phones proprietary nature with software that you can't see the source code of, modify, and run as you want I would not recommend it.
