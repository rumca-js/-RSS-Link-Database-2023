But the research device was malfunctioning and killing the nematodes outright. Electrical engineer and entrepreneur Jason Crisp fixed the machine, nipping some stray voltage that was causing electrocutions. The worms lived. Done and done. Except it wasn&#8217;t. Crisp began wondering about useful applications of that electricity to target soil nematodes that can damage valuable crops and vegetation. That spurred the idea for what is now Lisi Global, a Richland, Wash., startup that replaces&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/this-ag-tech-startup-kept-digging-and-found-an-electrifying-idea-to-zap-weeds-and-soil-pests/">Read More</a>

Nadella testified Monday that he worries Google will use its profits from search to strike exclusive deals with publishers for training its AI models, further boosting its market share to the detriment of Microsoft and other rivals, according to The Verge and Bloomberg News, reporting from inside the courtroom in Washington, D.C.

Redfin is cutting ties with the industry&#8217;s top trade organization. Early Monday morning, Redfin published&#160;an announcement&#160;signed by CEO Glenn Kelman and other top executives indicating that the Seattle-based brokerage would be leaving the National Association of Realtors.&#160; In the note, Kelman cited two primary reasons for the decision: an NAR policy that mandates a fee for the buyer&#8217;s agent on every listing and allegations of sexual harassment at the highest levels of the organization.&#160; Despite the ongoing&#160;commission lawsuits&#160;and&#160;growing outcry against NAR, Redfin leadership said this wasn&#8217;t an impulse decision.&#160; &#8220;We&#8217;ve had many meetings&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire

At the home of the Seattle Seahawks, just down the street from Amazon&#8217;s headquarters, the new Seahawks Pro Shop Outlet store gives football fans a way to grab some gear without needing to wait in line. We gave it a test run last week before the Seattle Seahawks hosted the Carolina Panthers. The store uses RFID tags to track individual products, instead of overhead cameras typically found at other stores with Amazon&#8217;s cashierless technology.

A jury determined that Zillow did not make deceptive changes to the way it displays non-MLS listings, a significant victory for the company. The Real Estate Exchange (REX) sued Zillow and the National Association of Realtors&#160;over what it says were deceptive practices to conceal non-MLS listings on Zillow&#8217;s heavily trafficked website. REX was a low-commission brokerage that ceased operations in May 2022. In a trial in U.S. District Court in Seattle, a jury decided Sept. 29 that REX did not prove Zillow used false advertising in its decision to put non-MLS listings&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/zillow-wins-jury-verdict-over-non-mls-listings/">Read More</a>
