Unless it’s a driverless car, of course. </p><p>The ironic thing about autonomous technology is that now the blame falls on the object. We cannot just take cars away from sober people because someone else drives drunk. But we can take autonomous vehicles away from all because the responsibility now falls upon the inanimate object since it can move itself. </p><p>However, liberals seem to think guns are autonomous. But that’s beside the point of this article. </p><p>California has put the brakes on driverless Cruise Taxis, following an unfortunate incident where it allegedly struck and dragged a pedestrian in San Francisco earlier this month. The DMV has suspended its permits for testing driverless vehicles, effective immediately.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

A pro-Hamas supporter was walking around and ripping down posters that Jews put up of the hostages Hamas took on October 7th. He got a harsh lesson in what "I represent Queens" means when a gentleman in not-so-subtle terms explained what could happen to his face.  </p><p>Side note, Queens is where my origin story began.

One group of celebs is following the boilerplate "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/alyssa-milano-biden-ceasefire-letter" target="_blank">Both sides are bad, but blame Israel anyway</a>" line of messaging, The other group says that, maybe this time, the side that <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/gal-gadot-open-letter" target="_blank">raped, slaughtered, and burned people alive</a> might be worse. Heavy metal legend Dee Snider is firmly on that side and is all about Israel using "We're Not Gonna Take It" as their rallying cry.</p><p>Ever since 1984, when a group of people were taking a stand against another group of people, they chose "We're Not Gonna Take It" as their anthem.
