The Lord of The Rings: Return to Moria reviewed by Travis Northup on PC. Also available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.
As a big fan of both The Lord of the Rings and survival games, I was enticed by the idea that I can dive into a genre I already know and love with the rich lore of Middle-earth to keep me company (as well as a party of friends), but it’s disappointing to see such a promising concept do little more than a barely passable impression of better games. Combat is dull and repetitive, owing to overused enemy types and braindead AI, and limited mining opportunities or freedom with settlement building throws a wet blanket over the creativity that’s typically a selling point for the genre. Throw in rough technical performance and it becomes difficult to recommend Return to Moria to even my fellow Tolkien stans. There’s a decent game in here somewhere, as the compelling progression loop and chaotic multiplayer capabilities can make for a really good time – I just can’t g

## Was The Fight At The Five Nights At Freddy's UK Screening Real Or Not? - IGN The Fix: Entertainment

Was that Five Nights At Freddy’s fight in a London theater real? We neither can confirm the fight was real or fake, or if this blurred kid was actually involved in the alleged hoax fight. We’ve also reached out to the Met Police for further clarity, but they haven’t gotten back to us. The #FNAF community might be questions if that fight at the #FiveNightsAtFreddys movie screen was real or fake, but one thing that is real is a reboot of the Highlander movie starring Henry Cavill. And finally, some Invincible vs Powerpuff Girls news you might be interested in, and a whole lot more in today’s fix.

We explore the reveals we saw coming, the twists that caught us off-guard, the stuff that was planned for this sequel since day one and the ideas that got left on the cutting room floor. We also touch on how Insomniac Games teased the return of a major villain and how the studio approaches MCU-style crossovers with other projects like Beyond The Spider-Verse and Insomniac’s upcoming Wolverine video game. We also dig into the creative choices that veer from comic book lore, discover the suit that almost made the cut, and get the lowdown on why MJ’s role in the game packs a punch - but again, SPOILERS ahead, so if you haven’t finished this massive PS5 game, go do that!

Five Nights at Freddy's reviewed by A.A. Dowd. Narrated by Clint Gage.

Scott Cawthon helped produce this big-screen adaptation of his own indie horror phenomenon, but you wouldn't really guess as much. Expanding the game's simple, primal premise with a surfeit of character melodrama – at last, we learn the tragic backstory of security guard Mike Schmidt! – it's a Five Nights at Freddy's that labors under the bizarre assumption that the loyal fanbase wants a lot of extraneous plot surrounding the fun-center horror. Switch off the monitor, slam the door, or just play the game instead.

Mortal Kombat 1 just had a small seasonal content drop, including this Halloween DLC fatality. Take a look at it here!

The Happy Halloween fatality costs 1200 Dragon Krystals, MK1's premium currency. Since 1250 Dragon Krystals cost about $10, that's roughly the price you're paying for the fatality. This fatality adds to the long list of gruesome ways to kill your enemies in Mortal Kombat 1, and more color palettes and costumes have been added to the DLC shop as well.

NHL 24 reviewed by Nick Ransbottom on PlayStation 5. Also available on Xbox Series X/S. Narration by Mark Medina.

What’s new in NHL 24 shows a lot of promise. The Exhaust Engine introduces satisfying mechanics that make games feel more intense, though refinement to its balance is needed to keep the defensive team competitive. The improved checking system and inclusion of HUT Moments are significant features as well. However, most of the returning game modes remain nearly untouched from the last couple of years and the introduction of a battle pass, along with some annoyingly long wait times to get into games, make it harder to cheer for.

EA Sports UFC 5 reviewed on PlayStation 5 by Tanner Smith. 

EA Sports UFC 5 is the best MMA game yet. Its next-gen presentation and refreshed mechanics are a dramatic improvement over previous games in the series, allowing for a more seamless and exciting recreation of the sport. The new damage system makes adjusting your strategy mid-fight more involved with plenty of risk-versus-reward decisions, making both offline and online modes all the more enjoyable and replayable. Career Mode has been fine tuned with welcome lifestyle improvements and a deeper story with Coach Davis. UFC 4 may have been the best MMA game mostly due to lack of competition, but UFC 5 stands a class above it, earning that title on its own merits as both an amazing sports simulation game and fighting game alike.

Massive spoilers follow for Loki Season 2 Episode 4.

The latest Loki episode is here and with it comes a crazy reset that just might have just changed everything we know about the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), not to mention who we think of as its current big bad.

Centering on the attempts of Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Sylvie (Sophia Di Martino), O.B. (Ke Huy Quan), and Mobius (Owen Wilson) to save the TVA — and the universe — with the help of its creator, Victor Timely (Jonathon Majors), Episode 4 ends with a shocking twist. Not only does their plan to fix the Temporal Loom fail, but it also leads to the death of a major character and the possible destruction of at least one if not all universes in the MCU.

How does this affect Phase 4 and Phase 5 of the MCU moving forward? What does it mean for Jonathan Majors’ Kang the Conqueror? And how does Ravonna Renslayer (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) fit into it all? Let's dig into what the wild events of Loki Episode 4 mean for the final episodes.

What thing in your memory is the most scary? Kid villains, obviously, right? Some of the most traumatizing villains in kids movies live in our memories well into adulthood as the things we find most scary. You may remember Judge Doom from Who Framed Roger Rabbit (Christopher Lloyd) from your nightmares, alongside Coraline and its Other Mother. The Other Mother, Coraline, and the weird button eyes are still haunting our dreams. Then of course, there are older memories, like from Return to Oz: the Wheelers. Return to Oz was an extremely unsettling movie and we certainly have the horrifying Wheelers to thank for that one. If you’re a big Star Wars fan, then it’s likely you remember Terak from the Ewoks movie Ewoks: The Battle for Endor following the grisly battle of the title. Hexus from FernGully seemed not-so-bad at first, but hopefully we can remind you of the final Hexus FernGully scene. Not even Disney is free of upsetting kids villains, with their darkest entry being The Horned Ki

Alan Wake II takes place many years after the story of the first game, and features two playable characters: Alan Wake himself, and an FBI profiler named Saga Anderson. Saga must reconstruct clues in her head to understand the secret of what's happening as Alan continues to try and write his way out of the Dark Place since the end of the first game.
