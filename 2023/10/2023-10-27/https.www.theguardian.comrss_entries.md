<p>Risk-free rugby has taken team to creditable third place at World Cup but limited gameplan will not cut it against elite</p><p>Whatever people think about England’s risk-free rugby, it has delivered for them at this World Cup. Played 7 Won 6 Lost 1. It is a far healthier return than seemed likely in the dog days of the August warmups. Even a few weeks ago as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/oct/07/england-samoa-rugby-world-cup-match-report" title="">they scrambled past Samoa</a>, few envisaged them picking up any medals this weekend, bronze or otherwise.</p><p>Aside from that one-point heartbreaker against the Springboks, when they were overhauled in the closing minutes, England have stubbornly found ways to win. It was the same again here as they took an early grip of the game and were just about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/oct/27/earl-and-dan-edge-england-to-victory-over-argentina-in-bronze-final" title="">able to cling on to it</a>.

<p>Things are falling into place perfectly for Ange Postecoglou. A second routine victory over London rivals in the space of five days courtesy of Joel Ward’s own goal and Son Heung-min’s eighth league goal of the season took Tottenham five points clear at the top of the table and wondering just how far they can go this season.</p><p>It wasn’t exactly the free-flowing football that this Spurs side has made its mantra under their exciting new manager but having been frustrated by a dogged Palace defence in the first half, a moment of inspiration from James Maddison finally found the breakthrough they were looking for. A visit to this ground is never an easy proposition for any title challengers yet even with Roy Hodgson celebrating his 500th game in charge of English clubs in all competitions, Tottenham passed their latest test with flying colours even after Jordan Ayew’s late consolation strike.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/27/son-heung-min-strikes-as-to

It wasn’t particularly pretty but Tom Curry was at the heart of a gritty, scrappy victory rounding off a difficult week for the England flanker on a high and neatly bookending his side’s campaign.</p><p>Borthwick has taken every opportunity to remind anyone listening that England were “written off” after a dismal warmup campaign so finishing third has exceeded expectations. They fell short – just – against the only genuinely elite side they faced but third place is not to be sniffed at given he only took the job 10 months ago.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/oct/27/earl-and-dan-edge-england-to-victory-over-argentina-in-bronze-final">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Lauren Hemp’s first-half strike was the difference, but the narrow scoreline did not tell the full story of England’s Nations League victory. This was a more familiar England performance, one closer to what we have come to expect under Sarina Wiegman, as opposed to the ones they produced last month. The Lionesses played with a swagger befitting their title of European champions, the win moving them level with the Netherlands on six points. Only the group winner will progress to the knockout stage and edge closer to securing a place in the Paris Olympics next summer.</p><p>There were three changes to the side that suffered a frustrating 2-1 defeat against the Netherlands last month, with Barcelona’s Keira Walsh back from injury and Manchester City’s Chloe Kelly and in-form Chelsea full-back Niamh Charles included in the starting XI.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/27/lauren-hemp-gets-england-back-to-winning-ways-against-belgium">Continue reading...</a>

But for obvious reasons emotions in the two faith communities are running high – particularly among those with family or other personal connections to the victims.</p><p>These feelings are an important aspect of the international response. But indications of rising hostility and distrust between those whose affinities lie on opposing sides of the conflict should concern us all.

<p>Sacrificing mass exposure for cash from lucrative broadcasting deals is strategically short-sighted. Rugby should not follow cricket down that path</p><p>It is difficult for sports other than football to run compelling World Cups because not enough countries play the game to make it truly global – or not to the required standard anyway. Even the rugby union World Cup, which has on the whole been a success and concludes on Saturday with a heavyweight final between New Zealand and current champions South Africa, has had problems making every match count. There have been classic encounters – the quarter-finals between France and South Africa and Ireland and New Zealand will live long in the memory – but also pointless (literally for some teams) drubbings. France 96 Namibia 0; Scotland 84 Romania 0; England 71 Chile 0. Such matches offer little to players or spectators, and merely emphasise the gulf between rugby-playing nations.

And most are falling like dominoes</p><p>It happened the way Ernest Hemingway, in The Sun Also Rises, described going bankrupt: “Gradually, then suddenly.” Last month in Georgia, Scott Graham Hall, an obscure bail bondsman and Trump supporter, took a plea. Hall had been indicted in Fulton county prosecutor Fani Willis’s Georgia election fraud case on charges of helping Trump surrogates steal election data from voting machines in rural Coffee country. Hall bargained his felony conspiracy and racketeering charges down to misdemeanors, for which he would pay nominal fees and serve no jail time. To many of his 18 co-defendants in the Georgia case, it must have looked like an appealing deal.</p><p>Hall was a small fish in the Georgia scheme, just a minor player in what Willis had charged as a sprawling conspiracy.

Under conductor Kerem Hasan the score sighs and swoons</p><p>Puccini’s La Rondine (the swallow) is, true to its title, a curious bird: not quite operetta and not quite grand opera, with few of the instantly excerptable set pieces of his more famous creations. The plot is a hybrid too: a cousin to La Traviata but minus its redemptive third act, and with a servant subplot redolent of Die Fledermaus.</p><p>Veering between comedy and tragedy, it culminates in one of the composer’s uneasiest endings, when the courtesan Magda is denied not just a happy ending but also the more familiar Puccinian option of a cathartic death. Determined that her own past will bring ruin to her unworldly lover Ruggero, she leaves him bereft – returning miserably to the gilded cage she has spent the entire opera striving to escape.</p> <

He started playing music at school and took a liking to guitars, basses, and fretboard techniques, and joined Rush in September 1968 at the request of his friend, guitarist Alex Lifeson. After starting out as a bluesy power-trio, the band flourished as one of the great prog rock acts, and achieved worldwide commercial success by the early 1980s with key albums incl

There was once a restaurant/llama petting zoo on the A66 near Penrith called the Llama Karma Kafe, where you could eat a jacket potato with tuna mix just metres from a crowd of these furry beasts, but sadly the place has long since closed.</p><p>Equally sadly, Llama Inn in Shoreditch is nothing like the Llama Karma Kafe, either – there’s not a slice of bakewell tart or a domesticated camelid in sight. Instead, it is a “cool” Peruvian restaurant down an alleyway, then up a lift and on to a Hoxton rooftop. You’d never get a llama in that lift, by the way; it’s far too small: the cool kids with their big shoes and oversized jackets have to take it two at a time.

Now, in one of their first interviews, the  trio say they’re ready to reveal all</p><p>Bar Italia are tired of being a mystery. The trio – who have spent their brief existence breathlessly feted as London’s most exciting new band, as well as its most enigmatic – are very much over their early inscrutability. “I’d rather be known as boring than mysterious right now,” says Jezmi Tarik Fehmi, who founded the outfit alongside Sam Fenton and Nina Cristante in 2020. “It was fine for a while but it’s got to the point where everything that’s written about us is caveated with the word ‘mysterious’.”</p><p>There’s a reason for that: until this spring, the band had provided no names, no photos, no background information at all. In fact, there was just a stream of dissonant yet irresistibly hooky rock released via cult hero Dean Blunt’s World Music label, which led to the kind of hype traditional guitar bands rar

Until then, I’d enjoyed several years of ghost-hunting, and was convinced I’d encountered many supernatural entities. Growing up in the 80s, my interest in the paranormal was piqued by TV shows such as In Search of … and Unsolved Mysteries, which documented cases of unexplained phenomena. In my 20s, I got hooked by the possibility of experiencing the “other side” and the idea that life continued after death.</p><p>While browsing ghost stories on the internet, I found a local ghost-hunting group in Philadelphia and joined them on trips to cemeteries and allegedly haunted buildings such as Fort Mifflin and the Eastern State Penitentiary.

<p>The world Nos 3 and 4 are battling for two Candidates places in the $460,000, 114-player event, but both started slowly while rivals who prepared with non-stop blitz began with wins</p><p>Hikaru Nakamura of the US and Alireza Firouzja of France, the world Nos 3 and 4, are among the favourites in the 114-player Fide Grand Swiss event at Douglas, Isle of Man. The event offers a $460,000 prize fund from the Scheinberg family, which has sponsored international events on the island since 2014. Two places in the 2024 Candidates, and a potential challenge to China’s world champion Ding Liren, are also at stake.</p><p>A fast start is reckoned important in such a high class field where almost all the players are rated over 2400, and many over 2600 and 2700. But both Nakamura and Firouzja began with draws against lower ranked opponents where at one stage they stood worse, while in contrast Parham Maghsoodloo and Nodirbek Abdusattorov, who came to Douglas direct from the Qatar Open and playe

<p>An unforgettable account of the life and murder of Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia</p><p>Journalism comes in many forms. Writing puffs about TV presenters is journalism. So is outing hapless celebrities over their sex lives, or researching long-form pieces about the future of the NHS. And so is sacrificing your life to warn people that their country has been taken over by gangsters. Daphne Caruana Galizia was this sort of journalist: one of the most courageous and outspoken people of our age. Here’s one of the last things she ever wrote about the Maltese government, in October 2017: “Do your worst, you bastards, until the only option left to you is to take out a contract on my life.”</p><p>At the very moment when Daphne Caruana Galizia pressed “send” on these words, a contract had indeed been taken out on her life, and her murderers were searching for ways to kill her. Finally they managed to plant 400g of TNT under the seat of her car. One of the gang, from a boat offsh

<p>From aubergine to plum to chocolate, dark foliage makes the perfect foil to bright flowers. We pick 10 top varieties to plant now</p><p>Landscape architect Capability Brown was fond of placing deep purple copper beech trees among the greens of oak and willow; the variation of leaf colour slowed the viewer’s gaze and offered focal points within the landscape. I was reminded of the power of this simple trick in my own humbler herbaceous border. This spring I planted tubers of dahlia ‘Bishop of York’ for their pale yellow flowers, but, come summer, it was their dark foliage that made the most impact. The near-black leaves offered a foil for the flowers in front and behind, making the rudbeckia and scabious pop, but also breaking up the continuous greenery. My small border appeared a good deal larger.</p><p>If you have room, dark-leaved trees are hugely worthwhile as a backdrop. Against a fence or an open view, flowers can fade; against deep colour they become emboldened. Besides copp

Whereas Mank – on the writing of Orson Welles’ Citizen Kane – was a sumptuous, substantial, awards-friendly hymn to old Hollywood (it was nominated for 10 Oscars and won two), his new film, The Killer, is a pulpy, violent, almost wilfully two-dimensional hitman thriller adapted from a comic book. “I will never be a more mature film-maker. I will carry the 12-year-old me with me wherever I go,” he says proudly.</p><p>Rather than growing up, it looks like Fincher is having fun – albeit in a highly controlled, Fincheresque way.
