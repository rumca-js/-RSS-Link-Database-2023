The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Flexport is in talks to buy the technology of Convoy, the Seattle-based trucking marketplace startup that abruptly shut down last week. Flexport would hire a small team from Convoy but wouldn&#8217;t take on any assets or liabilities, the Journal reported. We&#8217;ve reached out to Convoy and will update this story if we hear back. Last week Convoy executives told employees in an internal video call that it was exploring strategic options after announcing that the company was shutting down, just 18 months&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/flexport-reportedly-working-on-deal-to-acquire-convoys-trucking-tech/">Read More</a>

In a series of posts to X / Twitter and Instagram, Bezos and Nelson showed off pictures of the nearly three-story-tall Blue Moon MK1 cargo lander, which is taking shape at Blue Origin&#8217;s production facility in Huntsville, Ala. &#8220;MK1&#8217;s early missions will pave the way and prove technologies for our MK2 lander for @nasa&#8217;s Human Landing System,&#8221; Bezos said on Instagram.

The Archives is also digitizing records to make them more accessible online. Currently about 250 million records are available digitally out of over 13.5 billion total pages of records. The goal is to increase this to 300 million and eventually 500 million records digitized. Originals are preserved after scanning, Shogan said.

The demonstration &#8212; performed at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Wash. &#8212; took advantage of the energy provided by the radioactive decay of strontium-90. Zeno said its tests confirmed that the company&#8217;s technology can increase the specific power of its heat source compared with previously available strontium-90 heat sources. Zeno uses radioisotope heat sources as the building blocks&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/zeno-power-strontium-radioisotope-heat-source/">Read More</a>
