<p>Vice president Prabhakar Raghavan testified Friday that Google paid $26.3 billion in 2021 for the purpose of maintaining default search engine status and acquiring traffic, <em>Bloomberg</em> <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/google-paid-26-3-billion-to-be-default-search-engine-in-2021">reports</a>. It's likely the lion’s share of that sum went to Apple, which it has showered with exorbitant sums for many years in order to remain the default search option on iPhone, iPad and Mac.</p>
<p>Raghavan, who was testifying as part of the DOJ's ongoing antitrust suit against the company, said Google’s search advertising made $146.4 billion in revenue in 2021, which puts the $26 billion it paid for default status in perspective. The executive clarified that default status was the most costly part of what it pays to acquire traffic.</p>

## Horror movie Barbarian is getting a video game adaptation

<p><em>Barbarian </em>is one of the more memorable horror movies of the last few years. It tells a tale of a young woman who finds that someone is already staying at her rental home. She has little choice but to stay there since nearby hotels are all booked up. That alone is a nightmare scenario but the film goes into some truly wild directions from there. On the surface, it seems like an odd choice to turn into a video game, but that's exactly what's happening.</p>
<p>New Regency Pictures and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/friday-the-13th-the-game-server-shutdown-204920014.html"><em><ins>Friday the 13th: The Game</ins></em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/evil-dead-the-game-gameplay-trailer-201208908.html"><em><ins>Evil Dead: The Game</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>developer Diversion3 Entertainment have teamed up to bring <em>Barbarian </em>to PC and consoles. Despite the multiplayer format of the studio's previous projects, this will be a single-player, narrative-focuse

## Is streaming video even still worth it?

<p>When Netflix<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2007-01-16-netflix-watch-now-feature-offers-movie-download-alternative.html"> first unveiled</a> its streaming video service in 2007, it felt like a miracle. Netflix's DVD customers in the US, who were paying between $5.99 to $17.99 a month, instantly had access to 1,000 movies over a web browser. No more waiting for DVDs in the mail, no ads like TV – just hit a button and watch. Instantly! Now that seems like ages ago. Netflix's most premium 4K streaming plan now <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-jacks-price-of-its-premium-plan-up-to-23-a-month-201116571.html">costs $23 a month</a>, while its standard subscription without ads costs $15.49 a month. (There is a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-basic-with-ads-explainer-190555318.html">standard plan with ads for $6.99</a> a month, but that doesn't support offline downloads and also doesn't include some content.)</p>

<p>X is adding <a href="https://twitter.com/premium/status/1717977644996644948">two new </a>tiers to its subscription offering, previously known as Twitter Blue. The company is adding a new, $16 per month “Premium+ tier” that eliminates ads in users’ following and “for you” timelines, in addition to the blue checkmark and other existing perks for subscribers. X is also adding a new, lower-cost “basic” tier that costs $3 a month.</p>
<p>The new subscription plans come as X’s advertising business has continued to decline, and the company is increasingly reliant on subscription revenue. X has also recently begun testing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/x-is-starting-to-charge-new-users-1-per-year-to-send-tweets-000925191.html">a program</a> that requires all new users in some countries to pay $1 per year in order to post and reply to tweets.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the US International Trade Commission (ITC) upheld a judge’s earlier ruling that the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-infringed-masimo-pulse-oximeter-patent-103726704.html">Apple Watch violated patents</a> from medical technology company Masimo, as <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-trade-tribunal-issues-potential-apple-watch-import-ban-masimo-patent-fight-2023-10-26/">reported by</a> <em>Reuters</em>. Although the ITC’s order could theoretically lead to an eventual import ban on Apple Watch models, the iPhone maker still has ample opportunity to avoid that outcome.</p>
<p>The decision stems from a lawsuit Masimo filed in 2021, <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/30/masimo-apple-watch-series-6-itc-import-ban/">accusing</a> Apple of infringing on the smaller company’s patents related to light-based blood-oxygen monitoring.

<p>At the time, we weren’t entirely sure what to expect.

The gesture is Apple’s answer to the problem of using a smartwatch when your opposite hand is holding a bag of groceries, dog leash, flashlight or anything else. In addition, it can be a splendid accessibility feature for people with disabilities that could limit arm or hand mobility. Although the company only offers limited customization of the feature at launch, you can tweak a couple of settings to fine-tune Double Tap to your liking.</p>

<p>Over-ear, noise-canceling headphones typically offer the most comprehensive set of features we want for our listening pleasure. The best of these options combine stellar sound quality with powerful active noise cancellation (ANC) and other handy tools, like a reliable Bluetooth connection, to create as complete a package as possible. Of course, some companies do this better than others. At Engadget, we review a ton of Bluetooth headphones each year; for this guide, we tested out a number of different models with a variety of features, including noise cancellation, customization options and sound quality. Our favorites tick all of the most important boxes we'd expect quality wireless headphones to check, plus they span a range of prices so you can decide how much you’re comfortable spending.</p>

The M11-P also has a 60-megapixel sensor, and the typical understated layout and Leica styling.</p>
<p>Content Credentials capture metadata about the photograph – like the camera used,  location, time and more— and locks those in a manifest that is wrapped up with the image using a cryptographic key.

## Hertz decides to slow down its EV expansion

<p>In 2021, Hertz announced that it was going to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-says-hertz-hasnt-ordered-100000-tesla-e-vs-yet-103529013.html">order 100,000 electric vehicles</a> from Tesla by the end of 2022. Turns out the car rental company is far from being able to reach that number still, and it may take a while to get to 100,000, if it even gets there, because it's slowing down its plans to electrify its fleet. During the company's <a href="https://ir.hertz.com/static-files/75a583c0-90e0-496a-8b45-9f9d9389a93a">third-quarter earnings call</a> (PDF), CEO Stephen Scherr said Hertz's "in-fleeting of EVs will be slower than [its] prior expectations."</p>
<p>Hertz reported a 13 percent margin for the quarter, which Scherr said would've been "several points higher" if not for the cost challenges associated with EVs. One of the factors that affected the company's margins was depreciation, compounded by the one-third drop in retail prices of the electric cars in its fleet.
