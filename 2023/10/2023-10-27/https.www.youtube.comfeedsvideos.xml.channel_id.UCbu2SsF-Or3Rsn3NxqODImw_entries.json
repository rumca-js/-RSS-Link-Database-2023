It\u2019s first adventure with the friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man took familiar story beats that fans of Peter Parker have seen told and retold numerous times, but managed to weave them into a new unexpectedly fresh story that focuses on character development and deep, rich relationship dynamics. \n\nInsomniac\u2019s follow-up was a Miles Morales-focused title that had gave the studio more room to flex is narrative muscles. Like Peter\u2019s story, Miles\u2019s journey was one of deep personal growth, unexpected challenges, and heart-wrenching tragedies. When all was said and done, Miles had gained the strength and conviction to use his newfound abilities for good. And for us, we had two incredibly compelling Spider-Men. \n", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoKyidBbQFk", "date_published": "2023-10-27T15:00:25+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GameSpot - YouTube", "album": "GameSpot - YouTube", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/XoKyidBbQFk/hqdefault.jpg"}]
