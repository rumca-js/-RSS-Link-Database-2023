Have you ever wondered how a modern CPU is designed, tested, and manufactured? Same! Intel invited me out to their Malaysian HQ to see how the whole process works. It's bananas.

Intel has a lot of stuff going on in Malaysia: from their SIMS facility that manufactures testing equipment for their other factories/facilities, to testing labs that put their latest silicon through hell before production, to the actual die sort/prep and packaging, there's a lot to see. In this special episode of Snazzy Labs, we show the processâ€”from start to finish!
