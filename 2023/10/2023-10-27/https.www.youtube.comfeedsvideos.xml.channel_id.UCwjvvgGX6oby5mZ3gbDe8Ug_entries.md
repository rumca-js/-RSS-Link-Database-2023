On October 14, 2023, we aired a story about the sinking of the Chinese nuclear-powered submarine Type 093 No. 417, the Long March 15. Now more details are emerging, including the fact that one person may have survived. In this episode, we'll update this story, and in the second half of the episode, we'll look at an incident that has infuriated the Chinese Communist Party. That is, Taiwan has built its own submarine.
