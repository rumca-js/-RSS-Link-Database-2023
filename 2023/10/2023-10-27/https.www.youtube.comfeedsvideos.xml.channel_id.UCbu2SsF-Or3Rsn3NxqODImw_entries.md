Bryan Intihar, Senior Creative Director at Insomniac Games, joins Lucy James and Tamoor Hussain to discuss all things Spider-Man 2 including the game's emotional end.  

Through two games, Insomniac as established itself as one of the premiere storytellers in the Spider-Man universe. It’s first adventure with the friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man took familiar story beats that fans of Peter Parker have seen told and retold numerous times, but managed to weave them into a new unexpectedly fresh story that focuses on character development and deep, rich relationship dynamics. 

Insomniac’s follow-up was a Miles Morales-focused title that had gave the studio more room to flex is narrative muscles. Like Peter’s story, Miles’s journey was one of deep personal growth, unexpected challenges, and heart-wrenching tragedies. When all was said and done, Miles had gained the strength and conviction to use his newfound abilities for good. And for us, we had two incredibly compelling Spider-Men.
