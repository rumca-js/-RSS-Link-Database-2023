Is it savable/still usable?\" /> </a> </td><td> <!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi everyone, I had this PEI sheet working fine for at least a year with no issues, but recently I\u2019ve noticed that the \u201ctexture\u201d part started to fall off. I\u2019ve mainly used PLA with a bit of PETG, but recently I\u2019ve been asked to print parts with TPU and HIPS. What\u2019s on the picture is a result of printing a TPU stencil. The smooth part underneath seems fine, so my thought is perhaps I can turn this side into the smooth(ish) side by removing what\u2019s left of the texture. The bottom side is fine for now, but I tend to flip the sheet every now and then,", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/17hjyds/my_pei_sheet_started_doing_this_is_it", "date_published": "2023-10-27T09:50:26+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "Welcome to R/3D Printing!
