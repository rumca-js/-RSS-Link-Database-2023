Losing must be the new winning. With a single exception (and that was only a public college), every state (or city) that has passed an anti-drag show law has seen it blocked by a federal court. And yet, this string of losses doesn&#8217;t seem to be deterring performative legislators from trying to violate the First [&#8230;]

While recent evolutions in “AI” have netted some profoundly interesting advancements in creativity and productivity, its early implementation in journalism has been a comically sloppy mess thanks to some decidedly human problems: namely greed, incompetence, and laziness. If you remember, the cheapskates over at Red Ventures implemented AI over at CNET without telling anybody. The [&#8230;]

Last year, we wrote about the really bizarre case of a website called “Business Casual” that filed a couple of copyright infringement lawsuits. One was against TV-Novosti, the Russian state-owned news organization that runs RT (formerly Russia Today). While there was a brief period of time in which RT pretended that it wanted to be [&#8230;]

Law enforcement agencies aren&#8217;t used to oversight or accountability. That&#8217;s something that has rarely been deemed essential to the act of policing. After all, if the Supreme Court can create &#8220;qualified immunity&#8221; out of thin air to protect (most) cops from the consequences of their unconstitutional actions, surely podunk locals shouldn&#8217;t assume they&#8217;re more qualified [&#8230;]

Now that growth is saturated in the streaming sector, companies are increasingly behaving like the cable TV giants they once disrupted in a bid to deliver Wall Street improved quarterly returns at any cost.

For nearly a decade now, we&#8217;ve discussed Nintendo&#8217;s oddly combative relationship with the eSports community, specifically as it revolves around Super Smash Bros. tournaments.

Eager to maintain a lucrative repair monopoly over its products, Apple has had a long history of&#160;bullying independent repair shops. Apple lobbyists have also falsely claimed that making its products easier and less expensive to repair would result in vast untold consumer privacy and security nightmares, turning states that consider “right to reform” legislation into&#160;lawless [&#8230;]
