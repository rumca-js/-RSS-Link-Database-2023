<p>So dominant against Argentina in the World Cup semi-final, New Zealand decided to play with 14 men out of choice late on</p><p>By the very end the All Blacks were down to 14 men. Not because one of them had been sent off, or because they had run out of fit replacements, but because, well, they felt like it. Scott Barrett had been sent to the sin-bin in the 65th minute for slapping the ball out of the hands of Argentina’s scrum-half Lautaro Bazán Velez, but when his time was up again the coaches didn’t even bother to bring him, or anyone else, back on to the pitch. Apparently, they decided that it would be better preparation for next week to play a man short for the last five minutes. This, then, was a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/oct/20/all-blacks-into-world-cup-final-as-will-jordan-leads-demolition-of-argentina">World Cup semi-final</a> that ended up being treated as a practice match.</p><p>The All Blacks strung it out into overtime too, pitilessly running thro

Which is why it was so striking to hear him talk about the one problem which, by his own admission, he did not manage to solve in the six years he was coaching England. And that was what drives the players.</p><p>Not in their every day in training, he knew that, or even in their everyday games, against teams they knew they could beat, but in their hardest matches, under the heaviest pressure.

However, another championship will be decided in Austin where F1’s attempt to return a woman to the grid reaches the climax of its first season at the Circuit of the Americas. For the all-female F1 Academy this is both a finale and also a precursor for grander ambitions.</p><p>The series’ managing director, Susie Wolff, is fired up by bringing her drivers to the F1 undercard and encouraged by the positive results from the Academy’s inaugural season.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/oct/20/f1-academy-season-climax-austin-speeds-women-closer-main-grid">C

Around 20,000 of them will be at Saturday evening’s match in Paris, but they come more in hope than expectation. They know that form, recent history and the bookmakers’ odds all point to the same painful outcome: the world champion Springboks winning, and winning well.</p><p>Robin Randall, an England fan who runs an electrical contracting company in Nottingham, perhaps summed it up best. “I don’t think England have much of a chance,” he told the Guardian. “It’s just one game, so I suppose anything can happen.

Guardian environment editor whose intrepid and lively reporting drew attention to underdog causes across the world<p>John Vidal, the Guardian’s environment editor for 27 years, thought his greatest achievement was the <a href="https://www.gumbieducationfund.org.uk/" title="">Gumbi education fund</a>, set up after he wrote a moving piece in 2002 about how <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2002/aug/22/worldsummit2002.earth12" title="">the village of Gumbi in Malawi</a> was recovering from famine, and its children were desperate for an education.</p><p>Even though he had not asked them to, Guardian readers started sending money both to John and the paper to build a school and provide a teacher. John, who has died aged 74 of prostate cancer, was genuinely surprised his words were so powerful, always underestimating the impact of his championing of the underdog.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/20/john-vidal-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Theatre Royal Bath<br /></strong>The Succession star excels in Oliver Cotton’s play about the meeting between the composer and Frederick the Great</p><p>It is promoted as a dramatic encounter between God-fearing German composer Johann Sebastian Bach and the fearsomely godless Prussian monarch Frederick the Great. But that anticipated head-to-head does not come until the last hour of this uneven new play.</p><p>Under the direction of Trevor Nunn, The Score revolves around Bach’s trip from Leipzig to the king’s court in 1747. The first act is an extended prelude, scattered in tone and unsure of its purpose. There is an entertaining modernity in Oliver Cotton’s script, which strains towards the comic as the composer moans that he has to travel more than 1,000 miles to kiss the king’s arse. But it sounds rather too much like Bach by way of Blackadder.</p><p>At <a href="https://www.theatreroyal.org.uk/events/the-score/">Theatre Royal Bath</a> until 28 October</p> <a href="https

<p>Most of the action at the Conservative conference took place on the fringes, with dozens of prospective leadership bids</p><p>Finally back home after two weeks of living out of a suitcase in hotel rooms in Manchester and Liverpool. I find the party conference season exhausting. God knows how those who drink and spend their evenings going from reception to reception cope. I much prefer to spend my downtime having a meal out with colleagues. The Labour conference was understandably overshadowed by the atrocities in Israel and Gaza but Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves were well received both in the main hall and by the media in general. Everyone was very careful not to take things for granted – calling Starmer “the next prime minister” was banned – but it did feel as if we were watching a government in waiting. The Conservative conference meanwhile was glorious chaos. Almost as much of a shitshow as the previous year when Liz Truss was prime minister. The main auditorium had to be move

<p>Lots of autumn jobs are robust enough to be taken on by smaller hands – and you’ll be grateful for the help</p><p>Of all the activities children can get involved in, gardening never seems the most immediately practical. Dirt, potentially dangerous tools, and the chance of having a precious plant mangled (I have witnessed frustrated – and sleep deprived – adults shedding rage tears over alliums decapitated by footballs). It is possibly a lot easier just to take them to soft play.</p><p>But then pretty much every adult I speak to who loves gardening can trace this back to getting dirt beneath their fingernails as a child. Often we associate gardening with those who show us how, the patient parent, grandparent or family friend who gently takes our pudgy little hands and shows us how to pick blackberries, sow seeds or unearth a carrot that actually tastes of something.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/oct/20/make-this-half-term-one-where-you-nurture-a-budding

<p>Waste from the Jamaican capital has for years poured into the sea – but now a partnership between Dutch technology and local expertise is offering a solution that could go global</p><p>Kingston, Jamaica, boasts the world’s seventh largest natural harbour, at nearly 10 miles long by two miles wide. Trade has thrived here for hundreds of years. In 1720, this was where British colonialists hung and gibbeted John “Calico Jack” Rackham, often cited as inspiration for Captain Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean.</p><p>In the 20th century, up until the late 1980s, it hosted an <a href="https://www.jamaicaobserver.com/editorial/the-dream-of-a-clean-healthy-kingston-harbour/">annual cross-harbour race</a>. These days, however, swimming here is ill-advised. The city’s waste management systems struggle to cope with the volume of waste Kingston produces, with several gullies from communities around the city’s edge running directly into the harbour.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.co

For these schlubs, the desire to stay young forever meant smoking weed during the daytime, bumping Wu-Tang with your friends and going to rock shows without getting your wife’s permission.

How do we create new art that remembers but is unburdened by the past? These aesthetic questions quiver at the heart of Teju Cole’s mesmerising second novel, a feat of narrative invention about literature, painting, music, photography, race, the passage of time and human survival amid “history’s own brutality, which refuses symmetries and seldom consoles”.</p><p>Tunde, a Nigeria-born Harvard professor of photography, walks into an antiques shop in Maine and sees “an assortment of wooden masks and sculptures, three recognisably African”.
