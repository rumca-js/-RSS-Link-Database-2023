In today's Daily Fix:

Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is out and talk of the next Spider-Man game is already swirling around the internet. Developer Insomniac Games would definitely consider a spin-off title starring Venom, but they'll have to wait and see what the fan response to the current game is before they start the next one, whatever it may be. In other game news, IguanaBee, the developers of the much talked-about Skull Island: Rise of Kong, explained what led to the game's poor reception: time and money. Or rather, a significant lack of both.

Presented by Marvel's Spider-Man 2.

Skull Island: Rise of Kong reviewed on PC by Phil Hornshaw, also available on PlayStation, Switch, and Xbox.

Skull Island: Rise of Kong is ugly and full of bugs, but the real trouble is that, at its core, it’s just boring. It makes no meaningful attempts to do anything new or clever, with mindless combat and pointless platforming that make it feel like a worse version of every action game from the last 20 years. This isn't the kind of bad game you can play to laugh at, or that took some cool swings but missed them, or that creates weird combinations of technical snafus that lead to unexpected but entertaining results. It doesn't even rate enough to be called frustrating.

Check out this clip from Killers of the Flower Moon. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, Lily Gladstone, and Jesse Plemons.

At the turn of the 20th century, oil brought a fortune to the Osage Nation, who became some of the richest people in the world overnight. The wealth of these Native Americans immediately attracted white interlopers, who manipulated, extorted, and stole as much Osage money as they could before resorting to murder. Based on a true story and told through the improbable romance of Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Mollie Kyle (Lily Gladstone), Killers of the Flower Moon is an epic Western crime saga, where real love crosses paths with unspeakable betrayal. 

Killers of the Flower Moon is directed by Academy Award winner Martin Scorsese from a screenplay by Eric Roth and Martin Scorsese, based on David Grann’s best-selling book. It is produced by Martin Scorsese, Dan Friedkin, Bradley Thomas, and Daniel Lupi. Leonardo DiCaprio, Rick Yorn, Adam So

Join us as we take you through the evolution of Mario's voice. For the first time in over 20 years, there’s a new Mario voice actor in video games. But despite the consistency of Charles Martinet, the history of Mario’s iconic voice is more complicated than you might first think, with the iconic plumber having dozens of different takes over his 30-year lifespan. From Lou Albano to Chris Pratt, and Bob Hoskins to Kevin Afghani, this is the evolution of Super Mario's voice.
