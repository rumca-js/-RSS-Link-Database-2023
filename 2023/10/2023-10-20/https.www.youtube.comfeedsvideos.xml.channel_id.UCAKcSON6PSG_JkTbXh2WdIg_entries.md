How did @AnnieDiRusso end up using TikTok all the time? She says it was a “right place, right time” situation.

Australian band Middle Kids return to The Current studio to play one of their latest singles — “Stacking Chairs”.

At the time of their visit to The Current, Middle Kids were touring the U.S. supporting Manchester Orchestra and Jimmy Eat World, giving Middle Kids a chance to play some amazing venues, including Red Rocks in Colorado. They also got to enjoy the comfy amenities of a proper tour bus … although they did experience one leak-related mishap that, were we to sensationalize it, could be construed as a case of yellow journalism (ahem).
