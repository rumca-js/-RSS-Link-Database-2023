The reviews are in from two award-winning writers who are familiar with the impact of generative AI on creative professions. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s mostly nonsense,&#8221; science-fiction writer Ted Chiang said Thursday at the GeekWire Summit in Seattle. Chiang, a longtime Seattle-area resident, is best-known as the author of &#8220;Story of Your Life,&#8221; the novella that was adapted for the Oscar-nominated 2016 movie &#8220;Arrival.&#8221; But he&#8217;s also won acclaim as a commentator on AI&#8217;s effects for The New Yorker and&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2023/wri", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2023/writers-techno-optimism-ai-nonsense/", "date_published": "2023-10-20T18:27:11+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GeekWire", "album": "GeekWire", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://www.geekwire.com/wp-content/themes/geekwire/dist/images/geekwire-logo-rss.png"}, {"source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed/", "title": "GeekWire Summit recap: AI gets real in Seattle as historic theater plays host to future-focused event", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"945\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/summit2023-1260x945.jpeg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />In a Seattle building full of history and nostalgia, the GeekWire Summit returned Thursday with an agenda focused on rapidly advancing technology and what it will mean for the future. A crowd of nearly 600 attendees filled the SIFF Cinema \u2014 formerly the Cinerama movie theater \u2014 in Belltown for our annual technology conference, titled &#8220;AI Gets Real&#8221; this year in a nod to how artificial intelligence is transforming society. Panel discussions featuring Seattle tech leaders addressed AI&#8217;s impact on technology, business and strategy, and culture. Experts shared how AI is changing transportation, design and agriculture.

Mark Okerstrom, the company&#8217;s president, stood up and parted his flannel to show the Convoy logo on his shirt underneath, in an apparent attempt at a final display of solidarity. And with that, an 8-year journey for one of Seattle&#8217;s most high-profile startups was essentially over. Convoy exhausted every possible strategic option to survive over the past four months, but it wasn&#8217;t enough to save the trucking marketplace company from a sudden and surprising collapse. That was the message to employees from Lewis and Okerstrom on a company-wide&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2023/the-markets-crushed-us-in-tearful-farewell-to-employees-convoy-execs-reflect-on-shutdown/\">Read More</a>", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2023/the-markets-crushed-us-in-tearful-farewell-to-employees-convoy-execs-reflect-on-shutdown/", "date_published": "2023-10-20T14:57:07+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GeekWire", "album": "GeekWire", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://www.geekwire.com/wp-content/themes/geekwire/dist/images/geekwire-logo-rss.png"}]
