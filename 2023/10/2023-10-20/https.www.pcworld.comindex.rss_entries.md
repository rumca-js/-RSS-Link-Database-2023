<p>Microsoft is developing a convenient way to share Wi-Fi access for Windows 11, as spotted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.windowslatest.com/2023/10/19/windows-11-is-finally-getting-android-like-wi-fi-password-sharing-feature/&amp;xcust=2-1-2111874-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Windows Latest</a>.

<p>If you own a cell phone, you know the pain and fury of a 9 a.m. call from &ldquo;Microsoft Windows support.&rdquo; These and similar scams send out literally billions of robo-calls every year, plus various web-based scams, trying to hook the unwary for services they don&rsquo;t need.
