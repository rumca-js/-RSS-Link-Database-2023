Bangladesh stand-in captain Najmul Hossain Shanto might have brushed aside the notion that spinner Nasum Ahmed "intentionally" bowled a wide ball to deny Virat Kohli a century during the World Cup match. But former India batter Mohammad Kaif thinks otherwise saying Nasum purposely bowled wide to stop Kohli from scoring a century. A huge controversy erupted when the on-field umpire Richard Kettleborough decided not to signal Nasum's down the led side delivery wide with Kohli batting on 97 and India needing another two runs to achieve the target of 257.

The former skipper then went on to smash a six over deep mid wicket to complete his ton and India's win.
