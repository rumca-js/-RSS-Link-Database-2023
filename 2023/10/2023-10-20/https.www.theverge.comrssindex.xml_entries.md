Though we’ve seen a bit of this new personality <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23669598/super-mario-bros-movie-review">in the movie</a>, the Mario in <em>Wonder</em> is the most expressive I’ve ever seen him, reinventing a character that has largely remained a blank-ish slate for the last 30 years.
