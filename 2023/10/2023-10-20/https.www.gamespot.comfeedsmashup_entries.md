It's also his willingness to play any part, regardless of how bad it might make him look. It just so happens that many of his most memorable roles are the ones where he comes off the absolute worst. Take his stock broker in The Wolf of Wall Street, for example, or the heinously racist plantation owner in Django Unchained. These performances tend to stick in my memory far more than most of the ones where Leo plays a person we're supposed to like.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Warning: The following contains spoilers for several of DiCaprio's older films, along with his latest, Killers of the Flower Moon.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Killers of the Flower Moon is another one of these films.

Some badges will make stages easier, while others will make them even harder, or just augment your playstyle with something to suit your personal preference. The game is bursting with badges, but you can only equip one at a time.</p><p><strong>Action Badges</strong> are primarily earned through Badge Challenges, short stages that test your abilities with that badge before allowing you to equip it freely in other stages.

<p>Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is out now, but people are, of course, already wondering where the story might go next. Nothing is certain yet, but senior creative director Bryan Intihar has teased what's potentially on the horizon. Appearing on the Friends Per Second podcast featuring GameSpot's own Lucy James, Intihar said a potential third game could be "pretty epic."</p><p>"If Spider-Man 1 and Miles Morales were like our Iron Man, and Spider-Man 2 was like a Civil War, where logically do we go from there? I think it would be pretty epic. But, you know, we'll see," Intihar said.</p><p>It's worth it to watch the video, as Intihar makes some intriguing facial expressions as he takes his time and chooses his words carefully when discussing the future of the series.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/spider-man-3-creative-director-says-it-could-be-pretty-epic/1100-6518549/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Ahead of the holiday season, many companies ramp up their marketing efforts, and Xbox is no different. Microsoft has purchased ad space on the Las Vegas Sphere, and the company may have paid top dollar for the promo.</p><p>As shared by Xbox's Jeff Rubenstein and many others on social media, the Sphere has been taken over by an Xbox advertisement. The multimedia display shows the iconic green Xbox logo and then transitions into clips of Starfield, Hellblade II, Forza, and Cyberpunk 2077. The sequence ends with a sizzle of the three main Xbox consoles--the Xbox Series X, the 512GB Xbox Series S, and the 1TB Xbox Series S.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">The Xsphere has arrived <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PowerYourDreams?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc^tfw">#PowerYourDreams</a> <a href="https://t.co/gp8sqGf9JF">pic.twitter.com/gp8sqGf9JF</a></p>  — Jeff Rubenstein (@jeffrubenstein) <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffrubenstein/status/1715200416

All the way back to the 19th century, in fact. While the first two episodes of Season 2 have primarily dealt with the direct fallout from the Season 1 finale, this episode actually moves the story forward in a meaningful way. It just so happens that in order to move forward, they had to go back. Really makes you think.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Warning: This article contains many detailed spoilers for the third episode of Loki Season 2.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">This week, Loki swapped out the drab, brutalist hallways of the Time Variance Authority for the retro charms of 1800s Chicago.

In the process, we run into one of the most powerful members of The Seven.</p><p><b>Warning: The following contains spoilers for Gen V Season 1, Episode 6.</b></p><p>The kids end up trapped inside the unconscious mind of their friend Cate, experiencing her memories from her point of view, seeing her grief over accidentally causing her brother to disappear and making her parents afraid of her.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gen-v-brings-in-a-surprise-cameo-from-the-boys-this-week/1100-6518465/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
