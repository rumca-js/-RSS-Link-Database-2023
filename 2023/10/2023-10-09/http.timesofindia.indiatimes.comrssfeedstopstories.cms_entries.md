The AIADMK, a major political party in Tamil Nadu, is facing uncertainty after its recent decision to break ties with the BJP. The break-up has raised speculation about whether it was a mutual decision or a one-sided move. The AIADMK's future path will depend on the BJP's performance in the upcoming elections and whether the party can attract potential allies.
