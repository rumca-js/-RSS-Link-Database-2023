<p>Nahal Oz is just yards from Gaza. The gunmen showed no mercy, killing, kidnapping and starting fires to smoke people from their safe rooms</p><p>Nahal Oz, a kibbutz in southern Israel which is home to about 400 people, is so close to the Gaza Strip that the nearest Palestinian house in Sajaiya is just 600 metres away. Despite the hi-tech fences and buffer zone that separates them, the neighbours can see each other hanging the washing on the line.</p><p>Until the late 1980s, older members of Nahal Oz used to regularly drive a few miles west, to shop in Gaza City’s markets, eat the enclave’s famous seafood, or go for a walk on the Mediterranean coastline. Many still have friends in Gaza. Despite the Israeli blockade imposed in 2007, after the militant group Hamas seized control of the area, they kept in touch with calls and WhatsApp messages.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/09/they-are-in-my-house-kibbutz-survivors-tell-of-hamas-attack">Continue reading...</a

<p>Franck Haise’s team lost four of their first five matches in Ligue 1 this season but they are now racing up the table</p><p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/ericdevin_">Eric Devin</a> for <a href="http://www.getfootballnewsfrance.com/">Get French Football News</a></p><p>Lens were the darlings of French football last season. The northern club, who have a storied history – including a league title in 1998 – have played a scintillating brand of football under Franck Haise since their promotion to the top flight in 2020. They raised their game even further last season, losing just four matches and pushing eventual champions PSG all the way, missing out on the title by a single point.</p><p>Led by the impressive goalkeeper Brice Samba and the best defence in the league, their counterattacking brio was a thing of beauty. Their defence – Jonathan Gradit, Facundo Medina and Kevin Danso – was retained in the summer despite heavy interest in Danso, but they did lose a few key players, includ

Singer with the Marvelettes, whose single Please Mr Postman was Motown Records’ first No 1 single<p>The Marvelettes were never as successful or as famous as the Supremes, their Motown Records stablemates, but to many of their fans they offered a truer, more authentic incarnation of the label’s famous sound in a run of hits that started with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425GpjTSlS4" title="">Please Mr Postman</a> in 1961. Among the five girls who formed the group at school in Inkster, a suburb of Detroit, was Katherine Anderson, who has died aged 79.</p><p>So keen was the fledgling Motown company to unearth local talent that the top five groups in a talent contest at Inkster high school were invited to an audition. Although the teenaged quintet jokily calling themselves the Cansinyettes – “can’t sing yet” – had finished only fourth in the competition, it was they who won a recording contract.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/oct/09/katherine-anderson-obi

<p>In 1996 Labour was a year out from an election after more than a decade out of power. Its leader, Tony Blair, was surrounded by advisers and strategists plotting their way to victory. Kiran Stacey hears how they did it and what lessons there are for Keir Starmer’s party as it gathers for its annual conference</p><p>In 1996, Labour was way ahead in the opinion polls with their sights set on an election campaign expected the following year. The party had been out of power for 17 years and faced a Conservative party beset by scandals, bereft of ideas and heading for oblivion. The party was led by Tony Blair, a former lawyer who had taken on the left of his party and won internal policy battles with a pitch for the centre ground. The parallels with the present day could barely be clearer.</p><p>In the first of two parts looking back at that period, political correspondent <strong>Kiran Stacey </strong>hears from those who were around Tony Blair at the time: Labour’s campaign strategis
