<p>Unity game developer said that John Riccitiello <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231009494331/en/Unity-Announces-Leadership-Transition/?feedref=JjAwJuNHiystnCoBq_hl-SP7CEH_PxTjduXJ0SDrbU6qcp-o_pnudlUwsb5apQ1S4gUE65BTfjH3-pSuqdv0gW3cb3F4oTIgUqCPafFkgu67Ap_pA_yJ1XPgPy1DuJnY"><ins>will step down</ins></a> as president and CEO of the company after nine years in leadership, effective immediately. James Whitehurst, who previously served as senior advisor and president at IBM, will fill in as interim CEO. The leadership transition comes during a turbulent time for the company. <br /><br />Just a month ago, Unity rolled out some <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bowing-to-pressure-unity-announces-the-terms-of-its-surrender-193422770.html"><ins>significant concessions</ins></a> to its developer pricing model after widespread backlash over its plan to charge developers for game installations.

<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/taycan/">Porsche Taycan</a> is one of the most desirable EVs on the market, quick and lovely and yet somehow practical, too. But, with less than 250 miles of range on a charge and a starting price of at least $90,000, it's not exactly a mainstream car.</p>
<p>Porsche's next EV might get a little closer. Meet the electric Macan, which for a time at least will live along-side the gasoline-powered Macan. Porsche doesn't have all the details to share yet, but this battery-powered SUV will offer upwards of 600 horsepower in a similar, crossover SUV shell. Range? That hasn't been determined, but I was told it will go &quot;a lot&quot; farther on a charge than the Taycan.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>What it will cost, though, remains to be seen. The Macan is one of Porsche's most attainable cars, starting at just over $60,000, but the all-electric version is liable to be rather more dear than that. What's it like to drive? Even t

<p>Popular audio gadget maker Bastle just released an <a href="https://bastl-instruments.com/instruments/outsidify"><ins>iOS app called Outsidify</ins></a> that lets you capture and transform audio directly from your iPhone’s speakers and microphone. Despite the slightly cringey app name, it looks pretty darned fun, allowing users to explore the ambient noise around them to create some truly unique soundscapes.</p>
<p>Once you capture some audio via the app, use Bastl’s latest creation to make harmonious or discordant feedback, manipulate responses, apply resonant filters and more. You can even use your mouth, speaking directly into the phone’s microphone, to create your own resonant filter.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Additionally, you can capture impulse responses from just about anything, with Bastl using a coffee cup or a construction site pipe as examples. These IRs can then be used to run other audio sources through to create custom reverbs and the like, via a

<p>Meta’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/all-the-questions-we-still-have-about-threads-153059430.html">Threads app</a>, the social media platform that rivals X (formerly Twitter), may get a trending topics section. The potential new feature has come to light after an app developer <a href="https://www.threads.net/@willianmax/post/CyJm6rWvMtd">reposted screenshots</a> of the feature in use that were originally shared by a Meta employee.<br /><br />The developer that reposted the screenshots, William Max, said that, “Just to be clear: I'm not a “leaker” or anything like that,” in a post. He continued, “I simply follow many engineers and employees working at Meta, and one of them accidentally posted a screenshot that was meant to be private. Fortunately for us, I happened to see it at the right moment. I will not disclose who posted the screenshot for obvious reasons.”</p>

## Apple iPhone 15 review: The most substantial update to the regular iPhone in years

<p>New iPhones tend to be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-14-review-camera-test-sample-pictures-notch-specs-battery-life-130022134.html">rather boring</a>. Not <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-15-pro-max-review-apple-makes-a-strong-case-for-its-biggest-phone-130018980.html">the pricey Pro models</a> that get most of the fancy new features — I’m talking about the regular versions that are ideal for most of us. Apple has historically taken a trickle-down approach to its mainline phone, adding components and features from the previous year’s Pros as part of the annual update. That’s primarily what we’re dealing with on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-iphone-15-has-a-48-megapixel-camera-and-the-dynamic-island-174520662.html">the iPhone 15</a>, which starts at $799. However, the combination of those hand-me-downs, a revamped camera and the switch to USB-C make this year’s regular iPhone a worthy upgrade.</p>

## Meta Quest 3 review: A bit of mixed reality makes for better VR

<div id="a281b1f20c9b4fbfa9eeac02d22e40b8"></div>
<p>The Meta Quest 3 proves that the Meta Quest 2 was just an impossibly good deal. When that VR headset arrived for just $300 three years ago, it was the perfect gateway to VR for most people. You didn't need to hook it up to anything, you just flipped it on and stepped into virtual reality. But then Meta raised the price to $400 last year, and the entire VR industry just started to feel very stale.</p>
<p>It's no wonder the $1,500 Meta Quest Pro completely flopped – VR was already struggling, and few people actually needed something so expensive.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The $500 Quest 3 likely won't tempt over as many VR newcomers as the Quest 2, but it's still a solid step forward for Meta. It has all of the upgrades you'd expect, <em>and </em>it also has full color mixed reality cameras, which let you use VR apps alongside a view of the real world. Squint a bit, and you can almost see what Apple is going for wi

## The Morning After: ChatGPT creator OpenAI might start making its own AI chips

<p>According to <em>Reuters</em>, OpenAI is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/openai-is-reportedly-considering-making-its-own-chips-113010353.html">exploring</a> making its own artificial intelligence chips, even looking into an acquisition. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman previously blamed GPU shortages for users’ concerns regarding the company API’s speed and reliability, leading to these moves. OpenAI using its own chips could reduce its costs too. Based on analysis by Bernstein Research, each ChatGPT query costs the company around four cents.</p>
<p>At the moment, NVIDIA controls the market for chips that power AI applications. The Microsoft supercomputer OpenAI used to develop its technology, for instance, uses 10,000 NVIDIA GPUs. Microsoft, OpenAI’s biggest backer, has been working on its own AI chip since 2019.</p>
