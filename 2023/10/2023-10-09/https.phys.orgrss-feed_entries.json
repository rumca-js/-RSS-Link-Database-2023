The team have successfully broken the, often costly, closed-loop recycling loop of plastic waste, allowing upcycling to more valuable products.", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2023-10-scientists-upcycle-polyesters-waste-free-scalable.html", "date_published": "2023-10-09T09:29:03+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "album": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "user": null, "language": "en-us", "thumbnail": "https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/tmb/2023/scientists-upcycle-pol.jpg"}, {"source": "https://phys.org/rss-feed/", "title": "Claudia Goldin wins Nobel for work on women in the labor market", "description": "The Nobel prize in economics was on Monday awarded to American economist Claudia Goldin for her research that has helped understand the role of women in the labor market.", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2023-10-claudia-goldin-nobel-women-labor.html", "date_published": "2023-10-09T07:48:25+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "album": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "user": null, "language": "en-us", "thumbnail": "https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/tmb/2023/american-economist-cla.jpg"}, {"source": "https://phys.org/rss-feed/", "title": "Injured tortoises make slow recovery from Greece fires", "description": "In an animal shelter near Athens, veterinarian Kleopatra Gkika gently smears soothing cream on the leg of a tortoise, one of hundreds singed in Greece's devastating summer wildfires.", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2023-10-tortoises-recovery-greece.html", "date_published": "2023-10-09T07:44:03+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "album": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "user": null, "language": "en-us", "thumbnail": "https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/tmb/2023/volunteer-vet-kleopatr.jpg"}, {"source": "https://phys.org/rss-feed/", "title": "World can't 'unplug' existing energy system: COP28 head", "description": "The president of the upcoming COP28 climate talks in Dubai called on Sunday for governments to abandon \"fantasies\" such as hastily ditching existing energy infrastructure in pursuit of climate goals.", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2023-10-world-unplug-energy-cop28.html", "date_published": "2023-10-09T03:58:04+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "album": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "user": null, "language": "en-us", "thumbnail": "https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/tmb/2023/climate-talks-are-bein.jpg"}, {"source": "https://phys.org/rss-feed/", "title": "Typhoon Koinu skirts Hong Kong, heads for southern China's Hainan island", "description": "Typhoon Koinu tracked towards China's resort island of Hainan on Sunday night after skirting Hong Kong, bringing heavy rains and powerful gusts while prompting the closure of transport services and schools in the financial hub.", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2023-10-hong-kong-schools-typhoon-koinu.html", "date_published": "2023-10-09T03:56:24+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "album": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "user": null, "language": "en-us", "thumbnail": "https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/tmb/2023/heavy-rain-clouds-are.jpg"}, {"source": "https://phys.org/rss-feed/", "title": "Economics prize closes out 2023 Nobel season", "description": "The economics prize closes the prestigious Nobel awards season on Monday, with specialists on credit, the job market or inequalities expected to be among the contenders.", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2023-10-economics-prize-nobel-season.html", "date_published": "2023-10-09T03:45:51+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "album": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "user": null, "language": "en-us", "thumbnail": "https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/tmb/2023/us-economist-douglas-d.jpg"}, {"source": "https://phys.org/rss-feed/", "title": "Researchers identify largest ever solar storm in ancient 14,300-year-old tree rings", "description": "An international team of scientists have discovered a huge spike in radiocarbon levels 14,300 years ago by analyzing ancient tree-rings found in the French Alps.", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2023-10-largest-solar-storm-ancient-year-old.html", "date_published": "2023-10-09T03:00:02+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "album": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "user": null, "language": "en-us", "thumbnail": "https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/tmb/2023/researchers-identify-l-4.jpg"}]
