The Ancestors' Wrath is this year's Warhammer Day miniature and to celebrate this, we have a painting guide so you can paint it in the Greater Thurian League's colours to be Battle Ready. Then we'll add a few extra colours to take it to the next level.         

If you're new to painting - check out our Citadel Colour Painting Essentials videos to learn all about it: http://warhammer.me/3Vkojs6
