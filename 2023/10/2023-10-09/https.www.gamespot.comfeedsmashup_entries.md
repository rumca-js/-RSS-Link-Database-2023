<p dir="ltr">The Disney+ Goosebumps show has to be one of this year's biggest surprises. As a reimagining of R.L. Stine's best-selling book series, it offers more than just modernized versions of old stories. Rather, Goosebumps leans into the darker aspects of its clever plot, with frights that are bolstered by its talented cast and decent special/practical effects in a manner that could potentially elicit the titular fear response from its target audience.</p><p dir="ltr">This variation of Goosebumps isn't like the horror anthology series that ran for four seasons back in 1995. It's actually more akin to the Jack Black films directed by Rob Letterman, in that it has a central plot that pulls in elements from some of the most popular books in the series. The difference here is that Letterman and Nicholas Stoller were allowed to produce a more mature showing--one that allows for swearing, body horror, and an unsettling new way of compiling the tales of cursed items and monstrous entit

<p>The fall season is well and truly upon us, with tons of games releasing at a pace that I can barely keep up with. If you're similarly struggling to stay afloat with everything, you may have missed the release of Solace State--a visual novel roleplaying game in which you play as Chloe, a woman born as a genetic anomaly who can hack into the minds of other people to aid her efforts in navigating the cyberpunk-inspired world she calls home.</p><p dir="ltr">Though also visually stunning, Solace State's beauty lies in its story-- a compelling adventure about queer people of color being drawn into a conspiracy that threatens to plunge an entire country into a dystopian nightmare. It's a game that is both thoughtful and complex, encouraging you to stop and weigh the cost of rebellion against the risk of corporate hegemony, and it's also one of my favorite games of 2023.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">I sat down with Solace State executive producer and director Tanya Kan to discuss
