	With all of the news coming out of Israel you probably have a lot of questions about what’s actually going on. We have EVERYTHING you need to know. Also, thanks to OnlyFans, the 2023 SIMP of the Year Award has a new front-runner. As Israel is being invaded the UN doesn't seem to mind too much, since they put out a tweet to commemorate International Lesbian Day. It's weird.
