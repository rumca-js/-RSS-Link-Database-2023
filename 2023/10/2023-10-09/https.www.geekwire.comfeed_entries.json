Pearce said she was motivated to make the career pivot due to the growing urgency to address the impacts of climate change, including heat waves, floods, fires, and droughts. &#8220;I want to use as much of my time and energy as possible to make some kind of impact,&#8221; she wrote in a LinkedIn post. Ever.green operates a marketplace that matches corporations spending money to reduce their carbon footprints with developers that need funding to build energy facilities.

The ShakeOut on Oct. 19, at 10:19 a.m., is a chance for people to practice the drop, cover and hold maneuver wherever they are \u2014 at work, home, school, walking in a park or at a shopping mall. At about the same time, more than 120 Washington tsunami sirens along the inner and outer coast will be tested using the real wailing sound of a tsunami warning.

A magnitude 4.3 earthquake struck Sunday evening at 7:21 p.m. PT about 35 miles northwest of Seattle, south of Port Townsend, according to preliminary reports from the USGS and the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network. Many people reported feeling the shake, including in parts of Seattle. A tsunami is not expected, according to the U.S. National Tsunami Warning Center. ShakeAlert, an automated system designed to warn people that an earthquake has occurred and shaking is imminent, was reportedly not activated because the earthquake was below magnitude 4.5.
