Sonic the Hedgehog is back following the success of Sonic Frontiers, but this time, it's in 2D side-scrolling form. The game launches on October 17th for the Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, PS5, PC and Switch.

It marks several firsts for the franchise, from not reusing any Zones from the previous games to implementing campaign co-op. There's even a new mechanic where the Chaos Emeralds each have a unique power to use in combat and a brand new Special State.

Those who feel this is a step back after the well-received Sonic Mania shouldn't worry, as the game plans to replicate that classic Sonic nostalgia. Here's everything you need to know about the game before its release.

There’s a common notion amongst gamers that free games are usually inferior to titles that demand an asking price. And while that argument isn’t solely dependent on that factor, free games have a reputation of featuring graphics that one would call less-than-stellar.

Should you play Detective Pikachu Returns? If you are a fan of Pokemon, and enjoyed the original game, you will probably get something out of this one. While there are some changes to what the first game did, on the whole, the boat has not been rocked too much, and you will still get more of that same formula here. 

Younger players especially will probably like this game a lot and be drawn to it, with its charming characters, fun story, and simplistic gameplay. For older players, the recommendation has more caveats, but if you’re down for getting a deeper look at the Pokemon world than you otherwise get, you’ll find what’s here fun enough.

Big Ant Studios is back with another Cricket game, following up on the underwhelming Cricket 22. Cricket 24 looks like a step up in terms of presentation, but it's not long before you face the same old game.

Despite more immersive scenes while playing and sometimes fun gameplay, the sequel suffers from a lack of polish, flat-looking environments, wooden players, missing teams and iffy AI. Career Mode hasn't made any meaningful strides forward, and the "overhauled" fielding amounts to very little.

It also doesn't help that promised features like Pro Team are completely missing without explanation. The available content is extensive, but unless you rely on the community to fill in the gaps, Cricket 24 is ultimately a swing and a miss.
