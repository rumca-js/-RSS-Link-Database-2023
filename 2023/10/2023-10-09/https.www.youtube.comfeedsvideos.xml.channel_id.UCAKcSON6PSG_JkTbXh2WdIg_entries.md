If you're struggling with anything today, @sunnywarmusic's "Whole" is a beautiful song to help you get centered.

Los Angeles-based folk-punk musician Sunny War — born Sydney Lyndella Ward — is known for her virtuosic guitar playing accompanied by deeply honest lyrics reflecting 21st-century concerns. From playing in smaller Americana scenes to being on multiple late-night shows in the past year, Ward’s journey in music has been nothing less than fruitful.

Her latest album, "Anarchist Gospel," explores resiliency and deep reflection, as it’s wrapped up in a bow of lush harmonic music with strong roots in Americana and folk.
