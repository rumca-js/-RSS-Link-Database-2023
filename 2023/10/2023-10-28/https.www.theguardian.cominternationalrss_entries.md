<p>In the battle of the former Bournemouth managers, neither Eddie Howe nor Gary O’Neil could prevail. A full-blooded contest contained much high-end flair but too many reminders that VAR serves to incite criticism and pressure on referees rather than make their life easier.</p><p>Anthony Taylor, the referee, delivered a series of debatable – and unpopular – decisions, including the penalty from which Callum Wilson scored his and Newcastle’s second. Taylor departed the scene to boos from home fans who had jeered his every subsequent decision; Stockley Park had taken an age to back his call. The longer the video-room deliberation, the more suspicious the paying public become.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/28/wolves-newcastle-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

Bayern opened their account with Kane scoring a 52nd-minute diving header, before Leroy Sané struck twice, either side of a Jamal Musiala goal, to kill off the game. Kane then scored again, with a stunning 60-metre looping strike from inside the Bayern half.</p><p><em>There will be no Bundesliga blog from Andy Brassell this week but it will return on Monday 6 November</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/28/bundesliga

<p>By digitising scents as we have images and sounds, researchers hope they can transform everything from food and agriculture to disease prevention</p><p>“Did you ever try to measure a smell?” Alexander Graham Bell<a href="https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/mss/magbell/375/37500401/37500401.pdf"> once asked</a> an audience of graduands at a high school in Washington DC.</p><p>He then quizzed the probably confused class of 1914 as to whether they could tell when one scent was twice the strength of another, or measure the difference between two distinct odours. Eventually, though, he came to the point: “Until you can measure their likenesses and difference, you can have no science of odour,” Bell said. “If you are ambitious to find a new science, measure a smell.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/oct/28/giving-computers-a-sense-of-smell-the-quest-to-scientifically-map-odours">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The actor, 63, on the changing nature of fame, dipping in and out of therapy, and finding comfort in being an observer</p><p><strong>I grew up in a</strong> lower middle-class family in New York and had the fear of God put in me to do well by my mother. She was from a small town in Scotland and the only way out of her situation was education. I worked my ass off to do well, got As, and was good at sports, so I ended up being head boy, which I know makes me sound like a brown nose, but that’s not actually how it was.</p><p><strong>If I’d made the </strong>grade in my school choir my life might have been different. I went to a church school after third grade called Grace Church school in New York. My friends said: “Everybody gets in and they pay you and they give you those golf tournament-sized cheques, too.” I auditioned but didn’t make it. It was a fork in the road moment. I was like, “Fuck the choir. Fuck music. I’m going to be an actor.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/

<p>For a decade, apps have dominated dating. But now singles are growing tired of swiping and are looking for new ways to meet people – or reverting to old ones</p><p>Lacey deleted dating apps from her phone a couple of years ago and has never looked back – and not because she met the man of her dreams. The 55-year-old social worker now spends her weekends on the dancefloors of illegal nightclubs in north London’s Turnpike Lane<strong>, </strong>unlicensed venues where people go to let loose. “I meet so many men,” she says enthusiastically. She will often go out alone to these clubs where, she says, men outnumber women. “Recently, I met a younger man with an amazing body. It was probably the best sex of my life.”</p><p>As for her relationship status? “I’m always in a state of flux.” Lacey’s approach might not suit everyone looking for love, but she is one of a growing number of people rejecting swiping on a screen and taking their dating lives offline.</p> <a href="https://www.thegua

Unfortunately, most of the food goes untouched as family conflicts and life events compete for attention at the dinner table. The film left me utterly ravenous and in need of my own extravagant meal. In this recipe, the celeriac, after slow roasting, becomes intensely savoury, creamy and meltingly sweet – the perfect canvas for the brute of a salty, sour and crunchy dressing, or your own family drama.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/oct/28/meera-sodha-vegan-recipe-roast-celeriac-chive-chilli-oil">Continue reading...</a>
