SPOILERS! Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 has plenty of new faces as well as some returning faces. Insomniac Games’ senior creative director Bryan Intihar talks about which villain was always going to make a comeback, and what new reveals were a more recent addition to the story. Plus, is the studio worried about burning through the Spider-Man rogue’s gallery too quickly and running out of villains, or are there always enough bad guys to keep the wall-crawler busy? There have been plenty of reinterpretations of The Sinister Six, so who knows what’s in store for the seemingly inevitable Spider-Man 3 - or whatever they decide to call a sequel.

In today's Daily Fix:
The anticipated city builder, Cities: Skylines 2 was released to lukewarm reviews, with criticism directed at the game's performance. A theory circulating the internet points the blame to assets the game is rendering that aren't even seen by players and have no impact on the gameplay—they're talking about teeth. Yes, the game is rendering teeth for the NPC's, but the game's developers are claiming the teeth aren't the problem. In other news, you can expect more acquisitions in the games industry in the coming year. According to Axios, plenty of video game corporations are sitting on a lot of cash, and they gotta spend it somewhere.

Presented by Marvel's Spider-Man 2.

## Stray Souls Review

Stray Souls reviewed on PlayStation 5. Also available on PlayStation 4, PC, and Xbox. Narrated by Akeem Lawanson.

Despite a genuinely unsettling introductory chapter, Stray Souls is an ambitious but unsatisfying horror game that never quite gets going. Its characters are shallow and uninteresting, and while the sights and sounds of its world can be impressive, the mystery that unravels within it is told mostly through boring exposition dumps and left unsatisfyingly dangling. With poor optimization, zero polish, and some of the dullest bosses I've ever had the displeasure of fighting, Stray Souls is its own worst enemy, destroying its own subtlety with inelegant scares and tedious combat.
