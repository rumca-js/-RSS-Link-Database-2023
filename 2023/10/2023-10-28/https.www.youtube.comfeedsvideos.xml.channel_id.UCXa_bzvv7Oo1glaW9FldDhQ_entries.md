For all its success with Madden, FIFA (before EA Sports FC) and NHL, you would think Electronic Arts would figure out its fighting game franchises. Fight Night is nowhere to be seen, and the UFC series, which arguably peaked with UFC Undisputed 3, hasn't received as much love and care as, say, Visual Concepts' WWE 2K series.

That's incredibly evident in EA Sports UFC 5. While it adds new mechanics like doctor stoppages, Authentic Damage affecting in-ring performance and a new submission system, it's a little too reminiscent of 2020's EA Sports UFC 4.

EA Sports UFC 5 is still a competent and fun rendition of mixed martial combat. However, its recycled Career Mode and character creator, lackluster ground and pound, and whatnot make it more of a stopgap release than the next big step for the franchise.
