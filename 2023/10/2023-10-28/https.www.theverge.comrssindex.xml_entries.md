  <p id="iJHlQ4">Users have been reporting that their <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23663801">iPhone 15’s NFC chips were failing</a> after using BMW’s in-car wireless charging, but until now, Apple hasn’t addressed the complaints. That seems to have changed as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-to-fix-iphone-15-bmw-charging-issue/"><em>MacRumors </em>reported</a> this week that an Apple internal memo to third-party repair providers says a software update later this year should prevent a “small number” of in-car wireless chargers from “temporarily” disabling iPhone 15 NFC chips.</p>

## Apple’s Journal app is kind of smart — and kind of basic

  <p id="mwiI5s">The Apple Journal app is so simple that, at first, it felt like I was missing something. The whole app is just one screen: a reverse-chronological timeline of your journal entries, with a big plus button down at the bottom. I hit the plus, and an overlay appeared with some options: tap “new entry” at the top, or respond to one of Journal’s “reflection” prompts. “What could you do to make someone’s day better this week?” one of them asks. “Write about a time you found an unexpected solution to a hard problem,” reads another. </p>

  <p id="x8Z3RE">Microsoft has started testing new updates to its Xbox app on Windows 11 that improve the experience on handheld devices and smaller screens. In an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/10/27/xbox-insider-release-notes-xbox-app-2311-1000-41-0/">Xbox test app</a> released earlier this week, Microsoft has introduced a new compact mode that greatly reduces the sidebar on the left-hand side.</p>
