<p>As the seasons change, it’s the ideal time to overhaul your wardrobe. Focus on seven affordable key pieces for a fall revamp</p><p>Now that the seasons have finally shifted, it’s the perfect time for a wardrobe clear out and a good reorder. Move summer pieces to the back and focus on what you’ll be wearing over the next few months. Then ask yourself these questions: Is the item something you still wear? Is it a timeless classic? Does it still fit you? A one-in-one-out policy is encouraged for any new additions, sort your outs into things you can resell and list on sites such as Vinted and eBay and donate the rest to a charity shop. The British Heart Foundation (bhf.org.uk/shop) and Oxfam (onlineshop.oxfam.org.uk) offer a free postage label service for donations.</p><p>Prioritise key items for the season ahead. Our magnificent seven consists of the following pieces (you may well already own several): a heritage blazer (anything tweedy or checked); cargo pants; leather or leather-lo

<ul><li>Carlos Sainz second front-row lockout for Scuderia</li><li>Max Verstappen third but could face penalty</li></ul><p>Charles Leclerc saw off team-mate Carlos Sainz by just 0.067 seconds as Ferrari locked out the front row for Sunday’s Mexican Grand Prix.<br /><br />Max Verstappen improved on his final run at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez but could not usurp the Ferrari drivers, finishing 0.097 sec adrift. The triple world champion also faces a nervous wait to see if he is moved down the grid after being summoned to see the stewards. Verstappen, charged with impeding on the pit exit, is among four drivers who will be hauled in front of the race officials.<br /><br />Lewis Hamilton, disqualified from finishing runner-up to Verstappen at the United States Grand Prix a week ago, may too feel the wrath of the race referees for failing to slow under yellow flags. Hamilton finished only sixth, 0.288 sec back. George Russell, who qualified eighth, and Fernando Alonso, 13th on the gr

It will also be remembered as a tale of two captains.

From The Traitors to the revived Big Brother to the juggernaut that is Married at First Sight, reality shows have become talking points again. Survivor has long been a titan of the genre in the US, though its first attempt at a UK version, which appeared on ITV in the early 00s, lasted only two series. Now, the BBC has revived it, with a confident Saturday/Sunday double bill, featuring hosting duties from The Masked Singer’s Joel Dommett, here more rugged and windswept than in his usual Saturday night suit.</p><p>The theme tune sounds more like the sort of track you would find over the credits of a gloomy Scandi-noir drama such as The Killing or The Bridge, which is even funnier when coupled with Dommett’s grave explanations of how it all wo

<p>This is getting really, really ridiculous. “There have been so many classic games, so many magic moments,” Jude Bellingham said on the eve of his first appearance in the biggest match on earth and now he has one of his own, another absurd comic-book moment in an absurd-comic start to his Real Madrid career. With the Rolling Stones’ iconic tongue logo adorning the red and blue shirt of the home side, and Mick Jagger in the directors’ box, someone put Hey Jude on again. Not once, but twice.</p><p>And as for iconic: how about this? It was just after 6pm, the sun starting to dip behind the stand, when he stood in the corner of the Olympic Stadium in Montjuic and opened his arms wide once more. They were into added time and Bellingham had just slipped in behind the Barcelona defence to nudge the ball past Marc-André ter Stegen to score his 10th league goal of his debut season in Spain, and in the <em>clásico</em> no less. Nor was it just the winner: he had also scored an extraordinary

As the death toll in Gaza mounts we must see through the fog of war and find compassion; only that will stop the bloodshed<p>Three weeks into this latest eruption of violence, one emotion prevails. It’s what I felt as news broke of more than a thousand Israelis being murdered on 7 October. The same as Gaza is pounded night after night, Palestinians slaughtered in their thousands; or when I hear of civilians routinely killed by Israeli weapons in the West Bank, long before the world once again took notice. I worry for the safety of loved ones in the region. Yes, harrowing images shock. But really, I’m struck, again, by a total lack of surprise at all that’s happening: these events all feel so predictable. That’s not said with nihilism, nor as a detached pragmatist, but as someone who empathises deeply with all those caught up in this perpetual conflict, in ways I’ve long struggled to articulate or admit. I’ve marched waving both flags, and understand the psyche of both “sides” in ways

She is sound of mind, strong-hearted, mentally alert, and dispenses advice on X (formerly Twitter) on how to add those extra decades. “Order, tranquillity, good connection with family and friends, contact with nature, emotional stability, no worries, no regrets, lots of positivity and staying away from toxic people,” she writes. Natural yoghurt, genes and luck have also helped.</p><p>Branyas has agreed to become part of geneticist Dr Manel Esteller’s investigation into why, while chronologically a supercentenarian, her biological age is so much lower. Ninety may not yet be the new 50, but those aged 100 or more are on the increase, many of them defying notions of decay and frailty.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2

I hope this autumn is different</p><p>In a wood near us there is a badger hole just off the path. A couple of times we saw a lone badger living there. But that was a few years ago. The badger stopped using it, grass and weeds grew around it and all activity ceased.</p><p>Then last spring a small hole appeared, extending on to the footpath. It grew and grew until it was badger-sized – and completely hogging the path. But even this, which gave us hope, wasn’t really used. Now, this autumn, we were walking in the wood down the path and, trailing off into the trees, was a trail of sandy dirt!</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/28/young-country-diary-the-badger-sett-is-back-in-action">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As authors across the world explore their darkest fears, horror fiction is evolving to offer a chilling reflection of our times</p><p>There was a time, a few decades ago, when horror fiction meant just a few names. Stephen King and Dean Koontz in the US, James Herbert and Clive Barker in the UK. It was a boom time for sales but not critical recognition: a sea of paperbacks passed beneath school desks. And then, in the mid 90s, horror largely disappeared. Writers of darkness were repackaged into more market-friendly categories – thriller, dark fantasy, or that neutering, catch-all classification: suspense.</p><p>Now horror is emphatically back, and it is no longer a dirty word. Publishing imprints such as Titan and Nightfire are devoted almost entirely to the genre, small presses are helping to introduce new names, and a thriving online community of readers, writers, critics and commentators champion literature’s most sinister impulses.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/book

It’s a canine love story par excellence, and the defining scene takes place at Tony’s, a classic New York City red-sauce joint: chequered tablecloths, candles in chianti bottles, breadsticks and, of course, spaghetti with meatballs. We all know <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yoH3Vv0mRA">what happens next</a>: the lovers engage with the same strand of pasta and end up mouth-to-mouth, lip-to-lip, kiss-to-kiss.

Investigators used an app and facial-recognition technology to zero in and eventually got their man: Logan Barnhart, a construction worker in Michigan with a passion for fitness. His résumé included bodybuilding and modeling for romance novel covers. While hitting a punching bag in a workout video, he wore some familiar attire: a Caterpillar sweatshirt. Cue the Dragnet music.</p><p>There was something else remarkable about this investigation: the sleuths were ordinary Americans, part of a spontaneously formed citizen network volunteering their time to track down Capitol rioters.

<p>As his chilly new Netflix thriller The Killer is released, Guardian writers look back on their top picks by the director </p><p>More than The Silence of the Lambs, Seven launched a mostly risible trend of late 90s serial killer thrillers that mimicked Fincher’s grimy neo-noir style and the invariably disgusting fetishes that spice up the villain’s dossier. Yet none of the film’s successors could hope to equal the meticulousness of his direction or the bruised humanity that makes its characters such affecting and ultimately tragic figures. That the rain-soaked urban setting has no name gives Seven a unique power, as if this city of unshakable despair and moral rot could be a stand-in for any other on its worst day. Though Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt sound like stock partners in a detective procedural – one a world-weary, seen-it-all veteran, the other a brush, impetuous newcomer – they develop a soul-stirring bond that makes the gruesome shock of the climax all the more a gut punc

There may be other fine painters around, but on paper, with charcoal, ink pen or even crayons in hand, he is incomparable. So of course his retrospective of portraits on paper opening this week at the National Portrait Gallery is called Drawing from Life.</p><p>Hockney has always had a deceptively simple and absolutely captivating ability to look at his own face in the mirror, or at his “muse” Celia Birtwell, or at flowers in a vase, and set down what he sees, in clear, confident lines that vibrate with vitality.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/oct/28/life-drawing-boom-david-hockney-art">Continue reading...</a>

Ali fought in boxing gloves, Inoki did not but was prohibited from grappling, throwing or kicking, unless he had one knee on the canvas. Wisely, Inoki chose to lie down, away from Ali’s fists and land a series of leg kicks while the boxer tried to goad him into standing up. This lasted 15 interminable rounds. By the end Ali
