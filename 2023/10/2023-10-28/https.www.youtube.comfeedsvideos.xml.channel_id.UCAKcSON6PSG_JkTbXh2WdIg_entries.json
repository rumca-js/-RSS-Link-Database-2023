The pair graduated from the University of Texas in May 2023, and shortly before the release of their debut album, \"West of It All,\" they opened for the Dave Matthews Band at the iconic Gorge Amphitheater in Washington State. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t the first opening slot for Briscoe. They had previously visited Minnesota in April 2023 while opening for Ruston Kelly in the First Avenue Mainroom. In October, they returned for their own headlining slot at the 7th Street Entry. The day after, Briscoe visited The Current studio to play three songs from \"West of It All\" and to chat with host Mac Wilson.\n\nDuring their conversation, Lupton and Heintzelman talked about their achievements so far, what it was like recording their album with North Carolina (by way of Wisconsin) producer Brad Cook, and what they\u2019re looking forward to when they get back to Austin.\n\nWatch and listen to the complete session ab", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keAc0qeX3Zk", "date_published": "2023-10-28T22:15:01+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "The Current", "album": "The Current", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/keAc0qeX3Zk/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Grouplove -- Hello (live on The Current)", "description": "Los Angeles band Grouplove enjoyed a very busy summer in 2023, during which they took some time to visit The Current studio to play songs from their new album, including \"Hello\", which you can watch above. \n\nAll songs from Grouplove\u2019s 2023 album, I Want It All Right Now, available on @Glassnotemusic.\n\nMusicians\nChristian Zucconi \u2013 vocals, guitar\nHannah Hooper \u2013 vocals, tambourine\nAndrew Wessen \u2013\u00a0lead guitar\nDaniel Gleason \u2013\u00a0bass\nBen Homola \u2013 percussion\n\nCredits\nGuests \u2013\u00a0@grouplovemusic \nHost \u2013\u00a0Mac Wilson\nProducer \u2013\u00a0Derrick Stevens\nVideo Director \u2013\u00a0Eric Xu Romani\nCamera Operators \u2013\u00a0Micah Kopecky, Eric Xu Romani\nAudio \u2013\u00a0Derek Ramirez\nGraphics \u2013\u00a0Natalia Toledo\nDigital Producer \u2013 Luke Taylor\n\nYou rely on The Current to keep you connected to the music you love, and we rely on you to power this station.
