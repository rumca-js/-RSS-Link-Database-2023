We're continuing the tradition of Halloween Script Readings with a presentation of my screenplay for Misfits of Science.

Some of you may be old enough to remember the NBC series from 1985 called Misfits of Science, it was one of my favorite shows when I was a kid and over the last few years I have imagined a reboot of the series, eventually writing this pilot episode.

So join me and my gang of actor friends as we perform the script live.
