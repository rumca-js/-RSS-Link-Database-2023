Its target, a massive cloud of dust and gas known as the Cygnus Loop or the Veil Nebula, was created after the explosive death of a star an estimated 20,000 years ago \u2014 and it\u2019s still expanding.</p>\n<p>NASA plans to launch the mission at 11:35 PM ET on Sunday October 29 from the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. The Integral Field Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Experiment, or INFUSE, will observe the Cygnus Loop for only a few minutes, capturing light in the far-ultraviolet wavelengths to illuminate gasses as hot as 90,000-540,000 degrees Fahrenheit. It\u2019s expected to fly to an altitude of about 150 miles before parachuting back to Earth.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The Cygnus Loop sits about 2,600 light-years away, and was formed by the collap", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/nasa-is-launching-a-rocket-on-sunday-to-study-a-20000-year-old-supernova-193009477.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-10-28T19:30:09+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "Engadget", "album": "Engadget", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Instagram head says Threads is working on an API for developers", "description": "<p>Threads was missing a lot of features users would expect from a service similar to Twitter's (now X's) when it launched.
