<p>​The veteran Halloween ​director manages to turn terrifying material into a turgid mess in this fright-free revamp</p><p>On paper, it probably made sense. If “legacy” horror sequels (a film that brings back fan favourite original characters while passing the franchise baton to fresh blood) worked for the <em>Scream</em> and <em>Halloween</em> series, why shouldn’t <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/11/the-exorcist-william-friedkin-dvd-blu-ray-philip-french-classic">The Exorcist</a></em> get the reboot treatment? In the safe hands of David Gordon Green (various <em>Halloween</em> movies), the go-to guy for horror franchise revamps, what could go wrong? Rather a lot as it turns out. <em>The Exorcist: Believer</em> is inert, awkwardly structured and a criminal waste of Ellen Burstyn (who reprises the role she played in the original <em>Exorcist</em> a full 50 years later). It requires a rare ineptitude to take what is famously one of the most terrifying movies eve

<p>Tommy Lee Jones and Jamie Foxx are on top form in a rabble-rousing drama tackling racial inequality in US ‘death care’</p><p>A courtroom drama nit-picking over the small print of a funeral home’s legal agreements: <em>The Burial</em> probably has no right to be as crisply funny and boisterously entertaining as it is. Loosely based on a true story, this rabble-rousing examination of the racism hard-wired into America’s multibillion dollar “death care” industry is driven by the friendship of two men, one Black, one white. But this impressive second feature from Maggie Betts (<em>Novitiate</em>) neatly sidesteps <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/03/green-book-review-peter-farrelly-viggo-mortensen-mahershala-ali">Green Book</a></em>-style platitudes, instead balancing robust crowd-pleasing credentials against an acute dissection of the economics of racial politics.</p><p>Craggy, deflated in both manner and appearance, Jeremiah O’Keefe (Tommy Lee Jones) is about to

<p>Mirren ​c​an’t save this​ stifling study of Golda Meir during 1973’s Yom Kippur war</p><p>There’s a stifling quality to this portrait of Israeli prime minister Golda Meir (Helen Mirren, encased in spongy-looking layers of prosthetics), even before she has filled every frame with a fug of secondhand smoke. Unfolding over the brief, traumatic 19 days of the Yom Kippur war in 1973, the film plays out in sombre war rooms and oppressive offices. But for a couple of rooftop cigarette breaks and a trip to meet the troops, it could almost be a single-location stage play.</p><p>Director Guy Nattiv opens up the story by giving the PM stark visions of the conflict. And the score – metallic, jarring – adds tension. But Golda, forever peering beadily over an overfilled ashtray, remains oddly underdeveloped as a character.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/oct/08/golda-review-sketchy-portrait-of-former-israeli-pm-helen-mirren">Continue reading...</a>

They’re of a young woman, on holiday in Magaluf; a teenager with long brown hair and fake tan, laughing in her fake eyelashes and “out-out” clothes (belt skirt, stretchy top).
