Earlier, I had experienced a Turkish village in 2018 in a different province.  The reason I could reach Otluk was my friend Gokhan, who, after hosting me, has now started to host other tourists. #TravelVlog #MountainTrekker #turkeytravel \n\nHow to Contact G\u00f6khan - (local contact in Pamukkale & Otluk Afyonkarahisar) \n1. http://www.otlukvillage.com/\n2. https://airbnb.com/h/otlukvillage\n\nIf you like my videos, PLEASE SHARE them and let others get inspired to explore this beautiful world.
