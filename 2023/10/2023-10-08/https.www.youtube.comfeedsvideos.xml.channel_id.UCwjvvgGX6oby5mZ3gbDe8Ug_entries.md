#Chinainsights#Evergrande#Chinanews
On the evening of September 28, 2023, all trading of Evergrande’s shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange was temporarily suspended. Evergrande announced that "the Company has been notified by the relevant departments that Xu Jiayin, Executive Director and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, is suspected of committing a criminal offense and has been subjected to compulsory measures in accordance with the law".
The red economic system represented by Evergrande is irrational and unsustainable. When it comes to its end, there is no force that’s capable of stopping the various massive meltdowns.
