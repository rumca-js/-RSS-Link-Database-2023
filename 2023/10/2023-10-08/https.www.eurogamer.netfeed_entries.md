</p><p>Even more amazingly still, the cat isn't even a work of fiction created by the dev team. It turns out that a fan shared an image of the sweet kitty after he "recently crossed the <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/animals/2023/02/the-rainbow-bridge-has-comforted-millions-of-pet-parents-who-wrote-it">rainbow bridge</a>" and after bringing him to the attention of the team and offering "coffee and Timbits" to any dev prepared to immortalise the cat in the game, it seems Ubisoft did precisely that.
</p><p>"Am I reaching at straws here or?" asked suckashelfboi101 on the game's subreddit, seeking assurances that they weren't just seeing things. "Is this cats face supposed to look like

Developed by Ubisoft Bordeaux, the Assassin's Creed series celebrates its 15th anniversary this year with Assassin's Creed Mirage. Originally meant as an expansion to 2020's Assassin's Creed Valhalla, the overall scale of Mirage is certainly dialled down this time around. Expect a shorter, narratively tighter adventure - which is no bad thing. Not every game has to be an epic. Mirage focuses on a single main character too this year, named Basim - a new recruit to the Assassin's Brotherhood, who unleashes his parkour skills on a beautiful realisation of ninth century Baghdad. From the arid city outskirts to the bustle of the Damascus gates, all of this is brought to life by the Ubisoft Anvil Engine. But to what extent, if any, has the tech evolved from AC Valhalla?

Despite its connections to Valhalla's tech, Mirage is a smal

</p><p>Described as a "standalone" demo, players can get an early "bespoke" taste of the sequel's "bold new world" through a series of hand-picked puzzles spread across "stunning new locations, as well as a glimpse into the vast narrative that awaits them".
</p><p>As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-talos-principle-2s-philosophical-puzzling-arrives-this-november">Matt recently summarised for us</a>, the original Talos Principle served up an often fiendishly cerebral bout of puzzle-solving with lasers, time manipulation, and a healthy dose of philosophy. Essentially, each open-ended location featured a number of discrete puzzle "rooms" that required players to shift various contraptions - laser emitters, jammers, fans, blocks, and so

## Philipp Stollenmayer is the greatest indie game auteur you've never heard of

Philipp Stollenmayer makes games about bacon, death, cows, physics, pancakes, words and...games themselves. He's one of the finest minds working in indie game development today, if you ask me (not that you did).
</p><p>
He makes mobile games, so you've possibly never heard of him. Let's rectify that now, shall we?
</p><p>
Stollenmayer was once a gymnast, and you can really see that in his games; many of them centre upon the unpredictable thrill of flinging things around. He was skilful enough to compete in regional gymnastic competitions as a teenager, but quickly tired of repeating strict routines for judges.
