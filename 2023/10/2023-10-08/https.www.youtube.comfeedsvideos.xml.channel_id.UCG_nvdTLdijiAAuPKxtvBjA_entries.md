Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice was meant to begin the journey to Zack Snyder's vision of Justice League with Darkseid and Knightmare futures and whatever... but all it really did was stumble on the first step. And it got badly beat by Captain America: Civil War. I've already covered the problems of BvS in videos like "Why Civil War Worked and Batman v Superman Failed". But today I want to start a new series where I explore a solution that would fix those problems I've identified. And the fix for Batman v Superman is the death of Robin.
