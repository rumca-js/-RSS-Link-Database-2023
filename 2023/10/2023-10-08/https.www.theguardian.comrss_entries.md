## Torres rescues Aston Villa and angry Emery as Wolves finish with 10 men

<p>Perhaps the biggest surprise in this stop-start and spiky affair between Midlands rivals was that it took until the 94th minute for someone to see red. Wolves ended this ill-tempered draw with 10 men after Mario Lemina was sent off for a second yellow card during 12 minutes of second-half stoppage time but held on in a nervy finale against Aston Villa to claim a point.</p><p>Ollie Watkins, Ezri Konsa and the Villa substitute Nicolò Zaniolo went close to a winner, Watkins hitting a post and Zaniolo sidefooting inches wide from a Leon Bailey corner, but ultimately Pau Torres’s first Villa goal cancelled out Hwang Hee-chan’s opener. Wolves earlier missed a chance to regain the lead but Pedro Neto was unable to beat Emiliano Martínez after latching on to an arced cross by Sasa Kalajdzic.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/08/wolves-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

It’s rammed; standing room only. Next to the stove, cold water swimmers huddle and struggle to peel neoprene off shivering hands and feet, their teeth chattering. In fact, everyone is chattering. It’s as noisy as the pub before closing time and as ebullient; a steamy collective fuelled by extremes of temperature rather than extremely large amounts of booze. But, unlike the pub, everyone is semi-naked, sweating and stripped back – job title, wealth, celebrity and status left firmly by the pool.</p><p>“Since we opened the sauna at Parliament Hill Lido six years ago, we have seen visitor numbers shoot up,” says Paul Jeal, swimming facilities manager at Hampstead Heath for the Corporation of London.

The photographs, from <a href="https://www.ignacioevangelista.com/arte/after-schengen/">Evangelista’s series After Schengen</a>, depict the abandoned and derelict checkpoints of various countries. These range from imposing buildings to small prefabricated edifices and rudimentary obstructions embedded in the ground. Signatories to the 1985 agreement agreed to abolish internal border checks and embrace free movement for people and goods. Gradually, crossing points have been repurposed, have fallen apart or are disappearing altogether. However, as Evangelista observes, they remain “freighted with historical economic and political

<p>The champion of the waves talks about his extraordinary comeback, being hothoused by his ambitious father – and life off the board</p><p>Owen Wright and I have been chatting for about an hour when we both know, with resigned inevitability, that we are going to have to talk about the worst day of his life. Our conversation is on Zoom, but even on a video call you can see Wright, a 33-year-old Australian professional surfer, involuntarily stiffen. “It gives me a sore neck,” he says, giving it a little rub. “It doesn’t feel great thinking about it. It’s not clear. It’s patchy. And straight away, that kind of fear and panic comes over me. At the time I felt like things were going wrong. And it’s still like that today.” Wright smiles, but it lapses into a prolonged sigh, “Ohhhh, I don’t know if I’ve particularly dealt with what happened that day.”</p><p>So, let’s go there. It was 10 December 2015 and life was good for Wright, who is model-handsome with long blond hair: imagine “Austral

<p>Wolton, who died in 2021 aged 87, helped launch Richard Rogers and Norman Foster before swapping architecture for landscaping. Her dilapidated London home is almost all that remains of her fearless, uncompromising work</p><p>Behind an old brick wall in Belsize Lane, in a posh part of north London, stands a single-storey house that you would hardly know was there. Only a glimpse of a pitched glass roof gives a sign of shelter. You certainly wouldn’t know that it is a unique piece of modern architecture, a rare work by the distinctive, remarkable and under-recognised Georgie Wolton, who died two years ago aged 87. Old friends describe her as someone who “just did what she believed”. She was both “impossible” (although she “didn’t mind you telling her that”) and “fearless”. So, you might say, is the house.</p><p>To say the house “stands” requires qualification. It’s in bad shape, thanks in part to what an architect friend of Wolton’s calls her “gung-ho attitude to making buildings”.

A professor of socio-linguistics at Manchester Metropolitan University, he hears far more than what’s being said when someone opens their mouth. “I have this particular facial expression that indicates when I’ve stopped listening to the content of what someone’s saying, and am thinking about their accent,” he says. “Apparently, I start to quietly recreate the interesting sounds under my breath.”</p><p>Drummond’s fascination with the way we talk began while teaching English as a foreign language in Manchester in the early 2000s – some of his international students would take on a noticeable Manchester accent; others wouldn’t. “It led me to my PhD: why some Polish people in Manchester acquired a Mancunian accent, and some did not. The results were fascinating: people who intended to settle acquired a local accent quicker t

An exciting launch from Chocolarder is perfect for autumn<p>There are many good things about living in the country, such as I do. One of them is the number of farmers’ markets. I tend to go early, a great time to sample breakfast pastries, not so conducive to trying booze.

Increasing pressure to marry is political – so if it looks inviting, ask yourself whether what you really want is a big dress<p>Every few years the concept of marriage becomes a subject of debate and every time I find myself once again reeling. Reeling as I realise that we are still performing marriage in the same way we have for hundreds of years, despite its purpose fundamentally shifting – a bicycle has become a satsuma, a pan has become a palace. We no longer need to marry, for instance, in order to have sex, or create alliances between families, or acquire land, or produce heirs, or validate a pregnancy, or even have a wife we can take to business lunches to present ourselves as normal. We marry now for love and for parties, and also to legitimise our choices, and because it’s what our parents did, and to make a statement about commitment, and to fix something, and to create safety, and to draw a line, and find a feeling of belonging, and to claim adulthood, and any number of qu

<p>With 13 wins from 16 races, it is little wonder the new world champion is being hailed as ‘up there with the greats’ </p><p>There has been little doubt for a long time that Max Verstappen held a third Formula One world championship in his hands. Now the Dutchman has sealed the deal in Qatar after a season in which no other driver has had so much as a look-in, the nature of his relentless drive to the title can be fully appreciated. Some in the paddock even consider this the “Verstappen era”, and the 26-year-old has made a convincing case to be considered among the greats.</p><p>Verstappen has all but redefined the terms of what constitutes a dominant season in F1. He has taken 13 wins from 16 races for Red Bull, including a record-breaking run of 10 consecutive victories. Every time he has taken to the track there has been a sense of inevitability. His teammate, Sergio Pérez, in identical machinery, has been left flailing, pushing too hard in a forlorn effort to close the gap.</p>

<p>H​alf a century ago, the British portrait photographer captured ​some of the regulars at a game in Northumberland as part of his celebrated 14-month tour of England</p><p>In 1973, aged 21, Daniel Meadows refitted a 1948 doubledecker as the “Free Photographic Omnibus” and set out on a 14-month journey around England offering portraits, gratis, to all-comers. In the back window of the bus was a Letraset sign to give punters an idea of the project: Meadows was in the business, it proclaimed, of capturing “how things are and how they are changing”. With this in mind, he covered 10,000 miles and made audio recordings along with his pictures, selling the idea to his subjects that their images and thoughts would be preserved for history. That hopeful pitch came true. The archive of Meadows’s journey was bought by the Bodleian Libraries in 2018. A selection of the pictures and fragments of reporting from his journals and recordings are now collected in a new <em>Book of the Road</em>.</p>
