</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/counter-strike-has-delivered-on-the-promise-of-transferring-valuable-items-from-one-game-to-another-but-dont-mention-nfts-valves-only-interested-in-things-our-players-care-about/">PC Gamer</a>, the Counter-Strike 2 dev team &ndash; seemingly responding as a team and not as individual developers &ndash; said that whilst it had worked hard to ensure CS:GO players could transfer their skins and cosmetics into CS2, it "didn't know enough" about NFTs to contribute meaningfully to the web3 debate and claims that players could transfer their NFT cosmetics in the same way.

</p><p>"Would I ever do anything else?" he asks. "Yeah. I'm still thinking that I will. There will be a time when I retire. It's just that&hellip; this has all been so engaging."

</p><p>The comments come after Wizards of the Coast recently revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/magic-the-gathering-confirms-assassins-creed-fallout-and-final-fantasy-expansions-are-coming">what new crossover expansions Magic: The Gathering fans can expect to see next year</a>, including new sets based upon Final Fantasy, Fallout, and the Assassin's Creed series.
</p><p>Back in 2018, Rosewater was asked if WotC would ever "consider licensing a different IP and creating different cards for it". In response, he said that the team thought it was "important that Magic is one

</p><p>That's according to an interview Beaver gave with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5Iq8tw5yhc">CaptainBribo podcast</a>, in which he said that while he would "keep the lore beat it's predicated on", and "keep the lore you find out", he would "have Ellie there but in a different relationship [with Isaac] and redo the entire main story".
</p><p>As transcribed by <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/dead-space/3-chuck-beaver">PCGN</a>, Beaver talks with Bribo about how, if able to rewrite the third instalment of the terrifying sci-fi horror series, he would ensure the story focussed more tightly on protagonist Isaac Clarke, albeit retaining the co-op mechanic to illustrate how the two characters

</p><p>In the succinct post shared on Twitter/X &ndash; Yamauchi didn't add anything else, I'm afraid &ndash; the producer also appended the now customary screenshot that shows off a selection of super-charged cars obscured in shadow.

It is 1993 and the Wales family has just welcomed a new bundle of joy into the world: a rather fancy 486 DX2/66 desktop PC, sporting 4MB of video memory, 8MB of RAM, a whopping 260MB of storage, and - crucially for this story - like the far-flung future suddenly made manifest, a CD-ROM drive. I'm sure I must have presented a lot of compelling evidence beforehand about how we <em>definitely needed to get a PC because just think how good it'll be for my schoolwork</em> (and yes, Microsoft Encarta and, later, Microsoft 3D Movie Maker were very educational, thank you), but of course it was about the games. Talky versions of LucasArts point-and-click adventures! Theme Park but with an extra bit of video so I could pretend I was on the rides! But mainly, a game I'd been dreaming about since seeing its lavishly spooky lobby p
