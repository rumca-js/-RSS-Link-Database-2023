Tekken is back and better than ever, with Tekken 8 launching on January 26th, 2024, for Xbox Series X/S, PS5 and PC. It continues the long-running story of the Kazama family (and others) while introducing multiple new mechanics and features.

For instance, there's the new Heat Gauge for unleashing powerful actions like Heat Smash. Heat Engager allows for quickly entering Heat Mode and dashing towards an opponent, and Special Style provides a more streamlined control scheme for quickly unleashing combos. Of course, there are also new characters like Azucena who control great.

After going hands-on with the closed beta, Tekken 8 looks like an incredible follow-up, with stellar visuals and fast-paced battles. Even if the netcode is too early to judge, newcomers and veterans will find plenty to like.
