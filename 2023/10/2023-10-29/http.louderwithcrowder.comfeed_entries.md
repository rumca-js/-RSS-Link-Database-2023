	Jewish Americans who have loved ones kidnapped during the Hamas October 7th attack have been putting up posters of those hostages in remembrance. American progressives, who no doubt watch MSNBC and vote for Joe Biden, have been ripping those photos down in protest of... Jews being upset about Hamas? On the surface, their actions are pathetic. But maybe they have the hostage's best interests at heart. As this specimen says, they didn't consent to having their photos used.

	We here at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website are the ones to make basic accusations. But for what it's worth, this person looks and sounds like they/them also supports "Chickens for KFC." When our friend was busted ripping the fliers down, they claimed the fliers were "making matters worse."

</p><p>
	While others are calling to boycott UFC over them "selling out" to the beer brand, Strickland sees an opportunity. He views the deal as the beer admitting they f*cked up when partnered with a controversial t*tface performer and then sh*t on their loyal customer base in response.
