But, increasingly, when it comes to Elon Musk, there is no other option. Is he a visionary? A hypocrite? The last defender of the first amendment? Or simply a bullied kid who got his own back by buying the global playground and trashing it?

It is a character

<p>The latest collection to go online reveals the six centuries of influence of a medieval giant who predated the printed press</p><p>At a time of growing anxiety about the relationship between the analogue and digital worlds, there is cheering news from the British Library. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/oct/25/chaucer-digital-works-available-online-british-library-canterbury-tales-manuscripts" title="">The work of Geoffrey Chaucer</a> has just been added to a digital archive that is free to view anywhere in the world. Cynics may wonder who will be cheered, apart from a scattering of medievalist scholars. But they would be missing the point not only about the intrinsic value of the democratisation of ancient and delicate cultural treasures, but also about the beauty of being able, anytime or anywhere, to peer back into the past.</p><p>Chaucer offers a particularly strong case for this. More than 600 years after his death, he remains one of the greatest writers in th

<p>Springbok forward could have lost a leg in 2020 due to a rare condition but has battled back to win another World Cup</p><p>At first, there was no great cause for alarm. Pieter-Steph du Toit felt a blow to his left thigh, hobbled from the field and watched the rest of the game from the bench. Even as the injury began to swell towards full-time, he thought little of it. He had experienced a similar injury as a high school player a decade earlier, and that had turned out fine. It was only about 15 minutes after the game, when Du Toit informed his Stormers team doctor Jason Suter that he no longer had any feeling in his left leg, that the full scale of an unfolding medical emergency began to emerge.<br /><br />Du Toit had a haematoma that developed into an extremely rare condition called acute compartment syndrome. Which basically means that the tissue in his injured muscle had swollen to the point where it was blocking the blood supply to the rest of the limb. At that point, only 43

<p>The last time Emiliano Martínez scored an unfortunate late own goal after the ball rebounded off his own crossbar and in off the back of his head, Aston Villa were unlucky to lose to Arsenal. Since then, however, they have won all 12 games here at Villa Park and the Argentina goalkeeper’s misfortune here, after Ezri Konsa had nonchalantly headed against his own bar with Villa three goals to the good, was the only blip on an afternoon when Unai Emery’s team strolled to consolidate their place in the top five.</p><p>Especially once Villa went ahead, the first half resembled more of a training game of attack versus defence than an equitable Premier League contest. To be fair, the mismatch between these sides, who were four divisions apart only nine years ago, was epitomised by the Luton fans singing “Conference champions, you’ll never sing that”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/29/aston-villa-luton-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The trick for Everton was finding the edge to go with the organisation. This was a disciplined, resilient away performance, the kind to evoke memories of Sean Dyche’s best days at Burnley, but it might have gone unrewarded without a striker capable of gobbling up the smallest of openings. West Ham, who are in danger of drifting into trouble waters after one win in six league matches, might have stolen something had Dominic Calvert-Lewin not been ready to punish their lethargy with a clinical winning goal.</p><p>This was proof that Everton, who moved five points clear of the bottom three with this deserved win, are a different proposition when Calvert-Lewin is fit and confident. The England international has had a horrible time with injuries, but his importance to Dyche’s side shone brightly when he drove in his fourth goal of the season. Calvert-Lewin ran the channels, linked the play and took his chance brilliantly; in short he did for Everton, who also benefited from a fine defe

A small apartment in France makes an impact by mixing contrasting colours and materials<p>When interior designer Stéphan Bidoux first visited his apartment in Paris’s 10th arrondissement over a decade ago, it hadn’t been occupied for years. “It looked more or less as if it had been abandoned,” he recalls. “It was in a disastrous state, completely beaten up, with lots of things broken.” On the lower level were three tiny, separate rooms, which were not at all connected with the attic floor above. To see the latter, Bidoux had to pop his head through a trapdoor in the ceiling of the building’s communal landing.</p><p>Back then, Bidoux had only just embarked on a career in interiors (he’d previously been in marketing and advertising) and the work he did was largely architectural. He joined the two floors together, inserting a strikingly geometric steel staircase between the two. He also opened up the space almost completely. “I like it when there are as few constraints as possible,” he

<p>A low patch has been frightening, but getting through it has taught me a lot – and I can pass on those lessons to him</p><p>I’ve been having a tough time with my mental health lately. Anxiety and low mood have been compounded by my son’s repeated night wakings, and after settling him I have been lying wide awake, heart racing with adrenaline. Averaging three hours of sleep a night, it was inevitable that I would burn out with exhaustion eventually, requiring time off work.</p><p>Just typing these words, and the thought of you reading them, makes me feel shame. Shame that I haven’t coped better, shame at the burden it has placed on others, and shame that I’m feeling this way, when, considering the pain and trauma others are facing, I am lucky. That feeling of shame always creates in me an impulse to write. When I first started this series, mere weeks after giving birth, a female journalist I have known for years suggested that I was too vulnerable to be doing so. Yet if we never cr

The 9/11 atrocities were only two months earlier but despite the continuous grim developments from the still-smouldering wreckage of New York’s World Trade Center and President George W Bush’s retaliatory “war on terror”, his passing leapt to the top of television news and into banner headlines.</p><p>Even at such a time, there were no complaints of trivialisation; the Beatles had long ago ceased to be just a pop group and become something like a worldwide religion. And, sombre though the TV or radio coverage was, it included generous helpings of music that, 30 years after their breakup, still had undiminished power to charm and comfort. Inevitably, it awoke memories of John Lennon’s murder in 1980 – but the two

<p>Michael Fassbender is the clinical assassin, the Smiths provide the soundtrack – and Tilda Swinton’s cameo steals the show</p><p>Of the three films about assassins that premiered at the Venice film festival last month, David Fincher’s <em>The Killer</em> is certainly not the worst (Harmony Korine’s witless indulgence <em>Aggro Dr1ft</em>).

But it is the most conventional. Starring a cold-blooded, dead-eyed Michael Fassbender as a nameless, clinically efficient hired killer whose carefully constructed professional life collapses after one mistake, the film is in thrall to the movie mythology of the assassin and to the slick cynicism of Fincher’s own back catalogue.

She looks up to feel the splashes on her face, straining against the straps of her buggy and rendering its protective awning solely decorative.

What began as a downpour is now a torrent and great big stair rods are pummelling the pavement as we make the short trip home.</p><p>She takes after me, clearly.

I haven’t been a fan of Selfridge’s own-brand chocolate in the past – it was too sweet and wishy washy in the cocoa department to impress me. But this is fabulous. It’s single origin (the Dominican Republic) and a dark milk with an impressive backbone of 50% cocoa. Those things in themselves, while telling you it’s a chocolate that’s been given thought, don’t make for a great bar.

<p>The romantic writer took his own life aged just 17 after a row with Horace Walpole</p><p>In his 17 years of life, the “rock star” writer Thomas Chatterton lit a path for all the Romantic poets yet to come. His obsession with the mysteries of the past helped fuel a neo-Gothic boom in English creativity; William Wordsworth sealed the dead teenager’s reputation by referring to him as “the marvellous boy”; and in modern times postcards of Henry Wallis’s dramatic painting of Chatterton’s lonely deathbed have been pinned above many a bookish student’s desk.</p><p>Now “mega-rare” letters that spell out the poet’s sad story in his own hand are to be sold at auction for the first time. The correspondence to go under the hammer this November is evidence of a clash between Chatterton and a notable literary figure that scholars still suspect led to his suicide. “These are the missing piece of the jigsaw,” said Bonham’s head of books and manuscripts, Matthew Haley. “The whereabouts of these le

<p>An eight-year-old struggles with her gender identity one long, hot summer in Basque director Estibaliz Urresola Solaguren’s beguiling debut feature</p><p>There’s something transformative about the summer holidays. Those long, relaxed weeks released from the constraints and expectations of school offer the promise of reinvention, of hitherto undreamed of freedoms. The blank slate of vacation friendships, forged in the moment, with no historical baggage to drag along, gives a chance to start again. It’s no coincidence that so many coming-of-age films unfold against the languid backdrop of an endless childhood summer. But for some kids, that sense of release brings with it its own particular stresses and anxieties. <em>20,000 Species </em><em>of Bees</em>, the assured feature debut from Basque director Estibaliz Urresola Solaguren joins pictures such as Céline Sciamma’s <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/sep/17/tomboy-review">Tomboy</a></em> and Carla Simón’s <em><a h

But it was unusually significant, too. Brighton received the go-ahead in principal to find a site for a stadium purpose-built for women’s football.</p><p>It is an important moment not just for the club but the women’s game, with Brighton on course to build the first ground in England specifically for a professional women’s team.

I went to talk to him about this venture over dinner at Wolfgang Puck’s Spago in Caesars Palace, although he turned out not to be much of a conversationalist.

Sugar covers a multitude of sins in wine, but used judiciously it can work wonders<p><strong>Morrisons The Best Primitivo, Puglia, Italy 2021 (£8.75, </strong><strong><a href="https://groceries.morrisons.com/products/morrisons-the-best-primitivo-392537011" title="">Morrisons</a></strong><strong>) </strong>The wine business has a messed-up relationship with sugar. Too often, it’s used as an easy way to disguise shortcomings of flavour. A few grams of sugar will gloss over harsh acidity and rough tannins. Thanks to this year’s changes in the way duty is calculated, with wines below 11% charged at lower rates, the stealthy sweetening of wines has been getting even worse. One of the ways winemakers can keep alcohol levels down is to choose not to ferment all the sugar into alcohol, which can lead to a kind of greasy patina of sweetness. Which is not to say sugar is always a bad thing. Some styles, such as the bittersweet reds of Puglia – of which Morrisons Primitivo is a good example – h
