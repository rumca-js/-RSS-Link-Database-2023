Sean O'Connell : They call the snow leopard the ghost cat. Never lets itself be seen.
Walter Mitty : Ghost cat.
Sean O'Connell : Beautiful things don't ask for attention.
Walter Mitty : When are you going to take it?
Sean O'Connell : Sometimes I don't. If I like a moment, for me, personally, I don't like to have the distraction of the camera. I just want to stay in it.
Walter Mitty : Stay in it?
Sean O'Connell : Yeah. Right there. Right here.
