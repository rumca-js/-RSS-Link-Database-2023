American progressives, who no doubt watch MSNBC and vote for Joe Biden, have been ripping those photos down in protest of... Jews being upset about Hamas? On the surface, their actions are pathetic. But maybe they have the hostage's best interests at heart. As this specimen says, they didn't consent to having their photos used.\n</p><p>\n\tWe here at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website are the ones to make basic accusations.
