In this video, we test out the Ryzen 7840U SBC, a powerful single board computer that's perfect for Linux gaming. We're using ChimeraOS, a new Linux distro that's like SteamOS 3 but with even more features and support for a wider range of games.
We'll be playing some of the latest and greatest AAA Linux games, such as Elden Ring, Cyberpunk 2077, and Red Dead Redemption 2. We'll also be showing you how to set up ChimeraOS and get started with Linux gaming.
