<p>Valve has <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://twitter.com/CounterStrike/status/1712875606776729832">warned</a> <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> players that AMD’s latest graphics driver could get them banned. The problem lies in AMD’s Anti-Lag+ feature, which triggers the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/valve-anti-cheat-esports-change-213332601.html">Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC) system</a>, duping it into mistaking the driver’s low-latency mode for cheating.</p>
<p>The problem lies in Anti-Lag+ intercepting and redirecting Dynamic Link Library (DLL) functions. VAC views DLL reroutes as cheats (in other cases, they often are), which could lead to getting booted from <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>.</p>

<p>It’s hard to imagine that anyone in the world was demanding a hybrid Corvette, but those crazy engineers at Chevrolet went and did it anyway. Meet the 2024 Chevrolet Corvette E-Ray, but if you’re already angry at the concept, you shouldn't be.</p>
<p>The hybrid drive here isn’t to raise the efficiency of perhaps America’s most iconic sports car. Oh no. It’s only here to make it faster. 0 to 60 in 2.5 seconds and a quarter-mile in 10.5 fast. The electric motor up front adds 160 horsepower to the 495 that comes from the LT2 V8 in the back. Yes, it can be driven for a few miles emissions-free, but more important is how it boosts acceleration.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It helps the handling, too. The Stingray is a notorious understeerer on the track. The E-Ray does too, but give it a little throttle and that magic front electric motor pulls the nose right around and through. It’s a delight, and so is the E-Ray – a $104,295 delight. It definitely comes at a premium o

<p><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> developer CD Projekt Red has confirmed it used AI voice cloning software to reconstruct the voice of a deceased actor for its <em>Phantom Liberty</em> DLC.

We tested nine of the best VPN services available for our overall guide, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vpn-review-expressvpn-2023-gaming-streaming-160052492.html">ExpressVPN</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nordvpn-review-a-bit-too-overhyped-for-the-price-163100341.html">NordVPN</a>, Surfshark and Tunnelbear. Proton promises “privacy by default,” but that left me wondering if the company meant rigorous security testing — and if a focus on privacy would take away from ease of use.

<p>Did you know AMC makes video games? The television network responsible for <em>Mad Men</em>, <em>Breaking Bad</em> and <em>The Walking Dead</em> has a full-blown publishing label for video games, and it’s shepherded four titles to market since 2020. Its first was a real-time flight simulator from the NYU Game Center Incubator called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-10-amc-games-airplane-mode.html"><em>Airplane Mode</em></a>, which trapped players in the window seat of a commercial airliner for six literal hours, complete with the small luxuries and major annoyances of actually flying coach. AMC’s IFC channel even produced the in-flight safety video for that game.</p>

The news of Best Buy's decision comes only a few weeks after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-mails-its-final-dvds-to-subscribers-113557572.html">Netflix ended its 25-year DVD delivery service</a>, sending out its final copies on September 29.</p>

<p>Netflix is reportedly planning to open several bricks-and-mortar venues, called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-to-open-branded-retail-stores-for-some-reason-184331296.html">Netflix House</a>. The stores will sell merchandise for hit Netflix shows, hopefully of a higher quality than that Target <em>Squid Game</em> tee you sleep in. Talking of <em>Squid Game</em>, the two initial locations will reportedly feature obstacle courses based on the hit show, entirely missing the point of the show’s scathing view of modern capitalism.</p>
<p>There will also be rotating hit-show art installations and live performances to excite fans. Additionally, an in-house restaurant will serve themed cuisine and drinks from Netflix’s food-based reality shows.

<p>Cruise has been testing its self-driving vehicles in Houston <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cruises-robotaxis-are-heading-to-houston-and-dallas-094531398.html">since May</a>, and it started giving employees, along with select friends and family members, fully driverless rides in August. Now, it's offering the public the chance to catch a ride to their destinations on robotaxis with no drivers behind the wheel. The company is now onboarding Houston residents who signed up for its waitlist, and it's also encouraging those who've yet to do so to <a href="https://getcruise.com/rides/">visit its website</a> and send in a request for access. Those who do get in early will be able to hail a driverless ride through its app for a flat fare of $5 for a limited time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Initially, Cruise will have the authority to operate seven days a week from 9PM to 6AM only in Downtown, Midtown, East Downtown, Montrose, Hyde Park and River Oaks neighborhoods. The company typically begins by d

<p>Meta has shared an <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/10/metas-efforts-regarding-israel-hamas-war/">updated content monitoring action plan</a> as the devastating Israel-Hamas war continues. It follows a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thierrybreton.bsky.social/post/3kbi25uydll2p">stern letter from Thierry Breton</a>, the European Union's (EU) regulatory commissioner, to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/eu-official-gives-mark-zuckerberg-24-hours-to-respond-to-israel-misinformation-concerns-202919590.html">misinformation concerns</a> (such as deep fakes) and compliance with the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA). The company had 24 hours to respond.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The California Institute of Technology (Caltech) has reached a settlement with Apple and Broadcom over Wi-Fi chips, ending a billion-dollar patent dispute that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-05-30-caltech-sues-apple-over-wifi-patents.html">started</a> in 2016, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/caltech-ends-high-stakes-us-patent-fight-with-apple-broadcom-2023-10-12/"><em>Reuters</em></a> has reported. In a filing, Caltech said that it's dismissing the case with prejudice, meaning it can't be filed again.</p>
<p>The saga has taken several turns. Caltech initially alleged that millions of iPhones, iPads, Watches and other Apple devices with Broadcom chips infringed its Wi-Fi based patents. The institute initially <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-30-apple-must-pay-838-million-for-infringing-caltechs-wifi-patent.html">won a $1.1 billion jury award</a>, with Apple ordered to pay Caltech $837.8 million and Broadcom to pay an additional $270.2 million.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-announces-two-new-snapdragon-chips-for-next-gen-headsets-and-smart-glasses-180010526.html">Qualcomm</a> has just notified the California Employment Development Department that it's eliminating 1,258 positions within the state, according to <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-12/qualcomm-making-california-job-cuts-in-pledge-to-reduce-costs?cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-tech&amp;sref=10lNAhZ9#xj4y7vzkg"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>. That's around 2.5 percent of the company's entire workforce, which is approximately 50,000 strong, but the job cuts will only affect workers from Qualcomm's San Diego and Santa Clara, California offices. Based on <em>Bloomberg's</em> report, no position is safe: More than 750 of the affected employees will reportedly come from the chipmaker's engineering team, including director-level personnel. The remaining affected roles will come from across different departments and wi

<p>UK's antitrust regulator has <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/microsoft-concession-a-gamechanger-that-will-promote-competition">given Microsoft the green light</a> to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-133637845.html">buy Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion</a> following a protracted back and forth. The regulator called Microsoft's concession to sell cloud gaming rights to Ubisoft a "gamechanger that will promote competition."</p>
<p>With the last major obstacle out of the way, the Competitions and Markets Authority (CMA) has now largely cleared the path for the companies to close the biggest merger in gaming history. That move was widely expected after the watchdog <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsofts-activision-merger-set-to-get-its-final-uk-approval-083315786.html">said in September</a> that the company's revised merger agreement "substantially addresses previous concerns and opens the door to the deal being cleared.
