The Boys makes its intentions known very quickly when A-Train runs <em>through</em> Hughie's girlfriend, leaving the latter holding her hands, disconnected from her splattered body. She's instantly killed so that Hughie can get angry enough to join up with Billy Butcher and the crew. The Boys' new college-focused spin-off, Gen V, is a violent show, too. Its main character slices her hand open to access her blood powers, and even just five episodes in, the show is hinting that her control over blood is more extensive than you can imagine. Gen V not only features one of the bloodiest opening sequences in any show that I can remember, but it's also much more creative with its use of graphic violence and other body-horror-style moments thanks to its protagonists.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Warning: The following contains spoilers for Prime Video's Gen V through Epis", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gen-vs-graphic-violence-has-more-to-say-than-the-boys/1100-6518398/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-10-13T22:00:00+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GameSpot", "album": "GameSpot", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Fortnite - Assist In Destroying Zombie Road Signs Guide", "description": "<p>Fortnitemares is back in <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/\">Fortnite</a>, giving the battle royale island a spooky makeover.
