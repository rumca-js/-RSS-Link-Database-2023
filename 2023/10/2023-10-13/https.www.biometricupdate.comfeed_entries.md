		Two <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/panasonic-facial-recognition-system">Panasonic</a> divisions and a Singapore university have developed a way to train face biometrics algorithms that they say improves the performance of facial recognition for demographic groups represented by less training data, <a href="https://www.eetasia.com/new-tech-solves-conventional-issues-in-facial-recognition-accuracy-surrounding-race-and-gender/">EE Times Asia</a> reports.

The partner organizations are Panasonic Connect Co. Ltd, Panasonic R&amp;D Center Singapore (Singapore Research Institute) and Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University (NTU).

		Since Hamas launched its attack against Israel, the number of victims has been rising. The identification of the dead and wounded has proven to be a difficult task, with less than a third of the casualties formally identified. The police, military, and hospitals, on the hunt to quickly identify the victims, have turned to facial recognition from <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/corsight">Corsight AI</a> to help.

An article in i24 News <a href="https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel-at-war/1697144475-the-difficult-forensic-procedure-of-identifying-victims-of-hamas-massacre">reports</a> that as of Oct. 12, 2023, 1,076 bodies had been recovered. Of the 854 deceased civilians, only 361 had been formally identified, whereas all 222 soldiers

		Fingerprint biometrics submitted to India’s national ID system, Aadhaar, have been exposed by the West Bengal state government website, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/12/india-aadhaar-fingerprints-west-bengal/">TechCrunch</a> reports.

Security researcher Sourajeet Majumder found and reported a bug that exposed Aadhaar digital ID numbers, identity documents, photographs and images of fingerprints on the e-District web portal. Soon after he reported the bug to government cybersecurity body CERT-In and the West Bengal government, it was fixed, according to the report.

The bug allowed a prospective attacker to guess sequences of 16-digital deed application numbers, and publicly available tools enabled valid numbers to be identified based on responses from the server.

		Patently Apple <a href="https://www.patentlyapple.com/2023/10/apple-invents-a-new-kind-of-face-id-system-that-could-unlock-companion-devices-like-iphone-while-wearing-smart-glasses-or-vis.html">reports</a> Apple has filed a new patent application for a new Face ID system designed for smart glasses and, potentially, the Vision Pro.

This innovation would allow Face ID to synchronize with the cameras on and in the head-mounted display (HMD) to unlock companion devices such as Apple Watches, iPhones, iPads and Mac desktop computers.

Apple's patent addresses the challenge resulting from an HMD, like smart glasses, obscuring a user's eyes with IR filters. This obstruction prevents the user’s ability to unlock their companion device using facial recognition technology, for i

		Governments can enforce the security and privacy protections that people want in and maintain oversight over digital wallets through trust frameworks, while avoiding cost and complexity by not issuing digital wallets themselves, the Open Identity Exchange (<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/the-open-identity-exchange">OIX</a>) argues in a new white paper.

The “<a href="https://openidentityexchange.org/networks/87/item.html?id=706">Governments and Digital Wallets</a>” white paper considers a number of options for who issues and owns digital identity wallets, taking into account the benefits to end users, relying parties and governments.

		Some staff of the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) have willingly played a role in the issuance of national digital ID cards (CNIC) to non-citizens in Pakistan, the new chairman of the ID-issuing body claimed in a recent submission to lawmakers at the Senate.

New NADRA Chairman Muhammad Munir Afsar told the Senate Standing Committee on Interior that other than staff collusion, another factor responsible for the phenomenon is the aspect of aliens paying bribes to native Pakistani families to become part of their family trees, Dawn <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1780640">reports</a>.

		In an increasingly digital world, biometrics hold the key to keeping humans secure and connected, but the potential ubiquity of biometric sensors is currently challenged by the cost, supply and slow turnaround of silicon chip-based sensors.

FlexICs are a new type of integrated circuit: flexible, cost-effective, highly customizable and the only real alternative to silicon chips.

If you’re developing biometric sensors for applications such as fingerprint smart cards, find out from <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/pragmatic">Pragmatic</a>’s Vincent Barlier, Commercial Director – Foundry and David Verity, Senior Director – Design Platform, how FlexICs can enable a silicon-free future.
