Body cameras can&#8217;t possibly solve all the problems of current US law enforcement. No single thing can. But even though body cameras have so far proven more useful to prosecutors than lawsuit litigants and accountability efforts, that doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re mostly useless. They&#8217;re still capable of creating incontrovertible evidence. That&#8217;s why prosecutors love them, even [&#8230;]

California Governor Gavin Newsom has been on a bit of a tear lately vetoing bills that successfully pass the state legislature, including an effort to legalize psychedelics, an attempt to provide free condoms to high school students, an effort to cap insulin prices at $35, an attempt to provide severance to grocery store workers laid [&#8230;]

There’s an interesting story on Wired about “functional music” – things like&#160;white noise&#160;and&#160;brown noise&#160;– which is widely available on music streaming platforms. These kind of streams are causing a problem that arises from the fact that the money earned by streaming platforms is allotted in a rather odd way. All the revenues are put together, [&#8230;]

Elon Musk has made it clear that he’s no fan of the media. And while he seems to whine and pout when big media sites leave exTwitter, he keeps insisting that exTwitter doesn’t need journalists, because the his view of citizen journalism will magically be so much better. Of course, at the same time, he [&#8230;]

Alt-right semi-personality Laura Loomer just can&#8217;t win. And she shouldn&#8217;t! She&#8217;s ridiculous. She&#8217;s perhaps most famous for treating her own unwillingness to perform routine car maintenance as an act of anti-Loomer terrorism. When you think your decaying tires are somehow evidence of Islamic violence, it&#8217;s probably time for you to get off the internet (or, [&#8230;]

For decades now, cable TV has been plagued by programming contract feuds that routinely&#160;end with users losing access to TV programming they pay for. Basically, media companies will demand a rate hike in new content negotiations, the cable TV provider will balk, and then each side blames the other guy for failing to strike a [&#8230;]

We&#8217;ve talked about this sort of thing before, but here we go again, I guess. For the last decade or so, video games have gotten realistic enough in terms of how they visually depict wartime scenarios that misinformation utilizing video game footage has become a somewhat regular thing.
