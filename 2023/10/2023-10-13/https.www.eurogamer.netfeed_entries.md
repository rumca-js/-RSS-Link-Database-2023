Diablo 4 is just days away from launching on Steam, and one obvious question that's arisen following the news of its storfront jump - will it work on Steam Deck? - has finally be answered by Blizzard. And it's good news, taking the form of a 'Steam Deck Verified' yes.
</p><p>
I'll be honest, I've not actually played Diablo 4, but its predecessor was an absolute treat to have readily, portably to hand on Switch, so I can very much see why fans of Blizzard's latest would be keen for news on its Steam Deck compatibility.
</p><p>
And, thankfully, Diablo's global community development director Adam Fletcher had good news to share when he <a href="https://x.com/PezRadar/status/1712525922400895457?s=20">broached the topic</a> in response to fan queries on social media. "We can happily say," Fletcher wrote, "that Diablo 4

If you're a Counter-Strike 2 player with an AMD GPU, pay attention: Valve has warned that the company's latest GPU driver has introduced a new feature that, if activated, will result in a Steam VAC ban. So, basically, proceed with caution.
</p><p>
Here's what's going on; AMD's <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/release-notes/rn-rad-win-23-10-1">newly released Adrenalin Edition 23.10.1 driver</a> adds, among other things, Anti-Lag+ support for Counter-Strike 2, which, on the face of it, seems like an entirely positive thing. After all, who <em>wouldn't</em> want less lag in their fiercely competitive online shooty game?
</p><p>
Unfortunately, the way the Anti-Lag+ feature works - it does its job by "detouring engine dll functions", according to Valve - can have serious consequences for Co

## The Crew Motorfest tech review: genuine quality - but Series S is left behind

Between the paradise coastline, its mountain ranges, the bustle of downtown Honolulu and even its temples, there's no shortage of variety, and the new backdrop is a welcome gear change from the continental US setting of The Crew 1 and 2. </p><p>Reviewing Motorfest's performance on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Series S, it's clear the game still has some technical issues despite a month's worth of patches. How do the three consoles compare, do PS5 and Series X hit a rock-solid 60fps in their performance modes, and lastly what's the state of the lone 30fps mode on Series S? </p><p>On paper, the idea behind The Crew Motorfest is a proven winner. It takes the fr

With Microsoft's $69bn Activision Blizzard acquisition now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">officially a done deal</a> as of today, Ubisoft has been discussing its new ownership of all Activision Blizzard streaming rights, which also kick in today - and as part of the conversation, it's talked a little about physical media, saying that while interesting might decline as streaming rises, it doesn't think it's "going away".
</p><p>
Ubisoft secured the streaming rights to all Activision Blizzard games (for the next 15 years, and outside the EU, at least) as part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-will-sell-activision-blizzard-streaming-rights-to-ubisoft">revisions</a> made by Microsoft to get its proposed acquisition across the finish line after UK regulators <a hr

The Communications Workers of America (CWA), one of America's largest unions, believes Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard will "transform" the video game and technology labour market.
</p><p>
In a statement shared with Eurogamer, the CWA said today's merger represents a "milestone" in the industry.
</p><p>
"Under the terms of a ground-breaking, legally-binding <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2022/06/02/employee-organizing-engagement-labor-economy/">labour neutrality agreement</a>, Microsoft will remain neutral when Activision Blizzard employees express interest in joining a union, providing a clear path to collective bargaining for almost 10,000 workers," the CWA said, with its president Claude Cummings Jr calling this a "new day" for Activision Blizzard employees following mass employee protests

Activision Blizzard's controversial boss Bobby Kotick has said he will stay on as the company's CEO for the remainder of 2023, following Microsoft's long-awaited acquisition of the company today. 
</p><p>
A statement from Xbox boss Phil Spencer says similar, with Kotick's tenure at the company set to continue through "the end of 2023" to "ensure a smooth and seamless integration". 
</p><p>
Neither notice makes it explicit what will happen next year, though the wording of both statements suggests Kotick's departure is possible as early as January 2024.

Microsoft has now formally acquired Activision Blizzard, via the biggest company buyout in video games industry history.

Today's long-awaited closure of the deal brings to an end a process that has dragged on through almost two years of regulatory approvals and legal wrangling. Finally, however, it is done.

Microsoft now owns Activision, including the world's biggest first-person shooter franchise Call of Duty, plus the rights to Spyro, Skylanders, and Guitar Hero.

One of my favourite studio names of the last few years comes from the team that made PinOut. PinOut was basically Tron: The Pinball Game. Against a humming, buzzing, looping backdrop of glorious retro-futurist dance music, you raced across the highways and gutters of an endless swooping, arcing table, ricocheting off bumpers, finding secret paths and feeling like you were the single most vital part of a luminous living machine. It was a rush, a trip. And the studio? The studio was called Mediocre. 
</p><p>
Such a brazenly inaccurate name speaks to a great and quirky seam of buried confidence, I think. It's intoxicating. Who wouldn't love a studio that made a classic and still named itself Mediocre? And now - nobody, as far as I'm aware, from Mediocre involved - who wouldn't love a brilliant pool game called Subpar Pool?

"I'm over it. I'm so over it," he says at the start of the video as he leaves the office. "I am Hideki Kamiya, unemployed. Welcome to my channel."

This week, a rather freight-ening mod has pulled into that station we call <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-guides-tips-tricks-9352">Starfield</a>, which swaps out every ship in the game with that of Thomas the Tank Engine. Because, of course.

This "Really Useful Starfield" mod was created and uploaded by the aptly named <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/users/370317">Trainwiz</a>, who has kindly provided us with a rather sinister backstory explaining Thomas' arrival in space.

Our Game of the Week is Saltsea Chronicles, a beautiful seafaring adventure filled with choices and different islands to visit. There are people to meet, radios to listen to, dreams to sail and cultures to explore. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saltsea-chronicles-review">I thought it was wonderful</a>, and I hope anyone playing it over the weekend has a really magical time.
</p><p>
And now I'm finished, I've become intrigued by a simple question: why does this game that's largely filled with conversations and dialogue choices feel so much, not just like an adventure, but actual travel?
</p><p>
I think there are probably endless answers to this question, and the biggest one - which I want to touch on the least, because I want people to uncover it for themselves - comes down to the fact that each island you visit is so diffe

The developer of Lords of the Fallen has warned an update is still due for the Xbox version of the game to bring parity with the PC and PlayStation 5 versions.
</p><p>
The game has been available for press and content creators ahead of its release today, with frequent patches attempting to stabilise its performance.
</p><p>
The Xbox version was not made available for review and it appears the delay in this patch may be the reason.

The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has approved Microsoft's revised deal to purchase Activision Blizzard.

This leaves the door open for Microsoft to finally complete its proposed $68.7bn acquisition of the Call of Duty and Overwatch maker, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-near-deal-to-buy-call-of-duty-maker-activision-blizzard-report">over a year and half since it was first announced</a>.
