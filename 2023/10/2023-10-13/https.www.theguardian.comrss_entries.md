<p>Are you ‘team skeptic’ or ‘team believer’? Danny Robins’ TV adaptation of his paranormal investigations podcast promises analytical rigour and balance. But it’s deeply theatrical</p><p>Are ghosts real? Indulging the idea has created countless powerful works of fiction exploring grief, terror and other dark quirks of the mind. Try to pin down the cold fact of the undead’s existence, however, and a story soon collapses. So it is with Uncanny, ostensibly a series in which the writer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/sep/14/a-haunted-life-how-danny-robins-became-britains-high-priest-of-the-paranormal">Danny Robins</a> examines the claims of members of the public who have seen ghosts. It promises analytical rigour but it is pure showbiz.</p><p>Robins’ first case is brought to him by Kate, who grew up in the 1970s in Melbourn, Cambridgeshire, in a rattly 19th-century semi-detached house that became a large detached when her dad bought next door and knocked through.

Lose and it will be the end of a hugely pot-holed road, with frustrated supporters entitled to ask how much progress has ultimately been made over the past two tumultuous years.</p><p>The truth of the matter is no-one can be wholly sure which of the two outcomes will unfold. Once upon a time it would have been seen as inconceivable for England to lose to Fiji twice in the space of seven weeks, having only just sneaked past Samoa last weekend. These days almost anything feels possible and the Fijians are arguably the more predictable of the two opposing teams.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/oct/13/steve-borthwicks-england-reach-point-of-definition-again

<p>Economics is a religion where rhetoric persuades voters to believe bad policies can have good results</p><p>Paul Krugman, the Nobel prize-winning economist, warned a decade ago against thinking about budget deficits in terms of “<a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/10/more-on-invisible-bond-vigilantes/" title="">bond vigilantes</a>” and “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/27/opinion/krugman-death-of-a-fairy-tale.html?_r=0" title="">confidence fairies</a>”. He said politicians – mostly, though not exclusively, on the right – argued that unless governments cut their deficits, bond vigilantes would pressurise them by forcing up interest rates. But if they did cut them, the story went, then the “confidence fairy” would magically stimulate so much private spending that this would compensate for the loss caused by budget cuts.

It was shortly before 6.30am at the end of a Sukkot week of holiday when explosive devices, dropped from above by drones, made a mockery of past claims of impregnability by disabling the wall’s communication towers and its remote-controlled machine gun posts, while snipers picked off sensors and cameras, blinding Israeli defenders left staring at blank screens to what was in deadly motion.</p><p>Unseen in the weak light of early morning and unheard under the roar of the first of about 2,200 rockets fired towards southern and central Israel, Hamas fighters used wire cutters to make discreet punctures in the 20ft-tall double fence barrier or detonated small explosive loads to create larger openings.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/13/israel-darkest-day-24-hours-of-terror-hamas-gaza">Conti

<p>A new generation of brewers is making cider a drink you’d be as proud to serve at dinner as you would a wine</p><p>How often do you put a bottle of cider on the table when you have friends round? I may be doing you an injustice, but my guess is not that frequently, if at all. Most people regard cider as a summer drink, which they’re happy to enjoy down the pub, but would rarely think of pouring for friends. Frankly, those standard stubby bottles don’t really invite such behaviour, and the liquid inside them isn’t much to write home about, either, being, more often than not, made from concentrate and/or watered down.</p><p>And that is a problem for the new generation of cider-makers, who are producing some seriously impressive drinks, and it’s one they’re addressing by selling their wares in beautifully designed, full-sized bottles. These ciders are made from juice, not concentrate, and are often made with single varieties from low-yielding or forgotten orchards, which take time an

For great chunks of our conversation, which covers some sensitive topics, including Skinner’s own #MeToo experience, a waitress wields a loud vacuum cleaner nearby, threatening to drown us out.

<p>The horror unleashed by Hamas has brought tragedy to Israel and devastation to Gaza - and fear to Jews across the world</p><p>The word <a href="https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100333359#:~:text=An%20organized%20massacre%20of%20a,%2C%20meaning%20literally%20'devastation'.">pogrom</a> was not meant to exist in Hebrew. In the new Israel, the very idea of Jews being murdered en masse, their children butchered before their eyes, was meant to have been banished to the realm of bitter memory. It was only in the eastern Europe of exile that Jews would have to flee from tormentors bent on killing them, only there that they would hide in the dark, trying to stifle their breath lest they make a betraying sound. Once they had a state of their own, where they could defend themselves at last, there would be no need to speak of pogroms, except in the history books.</p><p>But it was a pogrom that came to Israel last weekend, multiple pogroms in fact, as lethal

<p>Game of Thrones and The Last of Us shot Bella Ramsey into the A-list before they were even out of their teens. Ahead of prison drama Time, they talk football, rapping and why fame is ‘silly’</p><p>It’s hard not to feel instantly protective of Bella Ramsey. The actor has just turned 20 when we meet in London, where they (Ramsey uses they/them pronouns) moved into a flat only a month ago. How did the Emmy-nominated star celebrate their first birthday away from home? A two-hour drive back to Nottinghamshire to catch up with family.</p><p>Now returned to their new city, Ramsey is dressed head to toe in Depop finds (bar the socks) and looks impeccably cool in a baggy rugby top and chunky loafers, sipping a lime soda in a bar. They shrug off fame because “it’s all quite silly”, and say they still “want to do all the normal things”, despite being recognised every time they leave the house. It’s puzzling to reconcile this unassuming, barely-graduated person with the massive TV characters

It’s much safer to call your new venture something along the lines of Moodz or Fantazee Bar; words with deliberate typos to denote the madcap mood inside: cocktails in fishbowls, plastic “greenery” on the walls, someone playing a “DJ set” off a laptop while their friends film the crowd on their phones, and the crowd films the DJ.

As the strutting high-school dropout Arthur Fonzarelli, AKA the Fonz, AKA Fonzie, Winkler was meant to be a peripheral character, though he was an instant hit with audiences – so much so that producers wanted to change the title to Fonzie’s Happy Days (Winkler begged them not to).

Readers with experience of depression share the advice that really helped them – and what really didn’t</p><p><strong></strong> During a difficult period a few years ago, a nurse told me to “be kind” to myself. I had to really think about what this meant; I realised it meant doing whatever small thing might feel nice – lying in bed if I wanted to, not doing much if I felt like it, and definitely taking a break from work. I started to really tune in to that, which meant I could identify tiny feelings of “relief” – for example, the feeling of putting my cheek on a pillow – and from there I was able to build myself back up again.<br /><strong>Faith Liversedge, 47, Edinburgh</strong></p><p> My friend told me to focus on the thing that you’re doing, rather than the next task. Basically, get up and shower but don’t start thinking ahead to what will happen later at work, just the next half an hour. It sounds obvious but, ultimately,

<p>Some varieties of garden pea can be sown in autumn – if you’re patient enough to nurse seedlings through winter</p><p>As you may have gathered, I’m a big fan of a crop that can be overwintered. The soil appreciates it when it’s not left bare, and growers benefit from a harvest arriving far sooner than from plants we sow in spring. Much like their relative, the sweet pea, certain varieties of garden pea can be sown now. Assuming they establish before winter truly sets in, they will – all being well – be ready to get growing, flowering and fruiting as soon as winter gives way to spring.</p><p>Peas are a cool-weather crop, so are ideal for this approach, but not all varieties lend themselves to sowing in autumn. Those with a wrinkled seed coat have many nooks where water can gather, which means they’re vulnerable to rotting before they germinate. So the varieties that boast a smooth seed coat – such as ‘Douce Provence’, ‘Meteor’ and ‘First Early May’ – are most suitable.</p> <a href=

<p>Mood-boosting five-a-day prints are the new florals. But maybe go easy on the aubergines </p><p>Tis the season of darkening mornings, so I bring you glad tidings: I have a remedy for the morning grumps. This failsafe cure works almost as well as having someone bring up your first cup of tea to drink in bed, and indeed the effects have been proven to last longer into the day. Your magic ingredient? A mood-boosting fruit or vegetable print.</p><p>We all know fruit and vegetables are wholesome if you eat them. But did you know they will also do you good if you wear them? It is literally impossible to be in a bad mood if you are wearing a dress printed with lemons, or a shirt covered in artichokes, or a cherry-emblazoned skirt.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/oct/13/fruit-and-veg-prints-are-a-recipe-for-good-taste">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I got my own round at 17, as soon as I passed my driving test, and have stayed so long because I really enjoy it</p><p>I can’t drink cow’s milk. I don’t like the taste and it doesn’t agree with me. I used to take a wee drop of cow’s milk in tea, but over the past few years I’ve gone off it completely. I don’t drink any milk now, but I love butter and I’m starting to like cheese.</p><p>I started working as a milk girl when I was 12, for Dad’s friend, who had a round near where I still live, in Ladybank, a village in Fife. There were three or four of us, aged between 12 and 16, who’d jump off the van to deliver the milk in bottles in the morning before school and on weekends. I worked for him until I was 15. There was neither plastic nor health and safety in those days. I’d be picked up with a few other kids at 3am, then Dad collected me at 7am, in time to get ready for school. Every door took milk and I loved delivering it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023

<p>Sensitive skin makes it hard for some to enjoy the benefits of retinoids, but new formulas reduce the effects of ageing, without the harshness</p><p>If you’ve ever tried to use a retinol skincare product but given up because of dryness, irritation, rosacea or discomfort, hydroxypinacolone retinoate is irresistibly calling you back. HPR (sometimes referred to as “granactive retinoid”) is a newer retinoid that’s much better tolerated by dry, sensitive skins, but packs a proper punch at acne, rough texture, pigmentation, lines and other visible signs of skin ageing.</p><p>We know retinoids work better than anything else on ageing skin, but unlike previous “gentler” (and in my view, inferior) retinoids such as retinyl palmitate, HPR actually delivers the sort of results that those tolerant of punchier retinoid types get to enjoy. And while I maintain that some people can’t comfortably use <em>any</em> retinoids and that it’s perfectly possible to have great skin without them, I believ

<p>Coetzee’s purist approach to storytelling strikes a chord in this novella and five tales</p><p>JM Coetzee is a consistently self-effacing writer, Joyceanly present everywhere in his work yet nowhere visible. All the same, he has a recurring alter ego through whom he speaks when he is at his most passionate. It is typical of this author that he should choose for his spokesperson – although that is far too strong a word – a woman. When we first met her, in 1990’s Age of Iron, she was called Elizabeth Curren, and, again typically, she was dying. That novel remains one of Coetzee’s finest achievements.</p><p>In The Lives of Animals (1999), a pair of lectures delivered in fictional form, Elizabeth Curren has become the ageing novelist Elizabeth Costello, who is much concerned with the “enterprise of degradation, cruelty and killing” of animals, which to her “rivals anything that the Third Reich was capable of”.

<p>A hike in the footsteps of mountaineering royalty also takes in some of the Scottish Highlands’ finest views</p><p>Excitement rises from the get-go. Ahead, a clearcut path leads through ankle-high heather across a landscape bound on either side by the Red and Black Cuillin, two dark-frowning massifs with deeply scarred features and bones of rugged gabbro. Even half-hidden in mist on this overcast morning, they are to me the most beautiful mountain ranges in Britain.</p><p>Yet beyond these, almost coming into the light between the two, is Sgùrr na Strì, a far more modest 494-metre knuckle of coagulated rock that threatens to upstage them. Many say the view from its summit is the most spectacular in Scotland, and the shifting of shadows from the hilltop’s panorama, across the Black Cuillin to Loch Coruisk, the Small Isles and the Sea of the Hebrides, make it feel as if it is always in motion.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/oct/13/pub-walk-seumas-bar-isle-of-sky

When the Swedish band attempted to launch in the US, the only label that would work with them was Playboy’s in-house musical operation, “who might have had other reasons for being interested in us”, band member Björn Ulvaeus later drily remarked.
