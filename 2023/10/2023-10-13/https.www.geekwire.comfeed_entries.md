I wasn’t sure we’d ever get here, but 21 months later, Microsoft has successfully fended off the FTC, pacified the CMA, and completed its $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. One industry leader has merged with another, which means Microsoft, on top of everything else it does, is now one of the highest-revenue video game companies in the world. It’s not a question of whether Microsoft will earn back that $69 billion, but when. Activision Blizzard, along with its mobile subsidiary King, controls several of the highest-grossing franchises in the games industry, one of which is the&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/analysis-microsoft-now-owns-activision-blizzard-which-shifts-the-balance-of-power-in-the-video-game-industry/">Read More</a>

Amazon, First Mode and PACCAR are among the companies with projects that could benefit from the deal. The DOE last year received hub concept papers from 79 applicants, which it whittled down to 33 finalists that submitted full proposals. Two made the cut from the Pacific Northwest.

UK antitrust regulators previously sought to block Microsoft&#8217;s $68.7 billion acquisition of the Call of Duty maker. Microsoft responded by agreeing to sell Activision Blizzard’s cloud gaming rights to Ubisoft. The companies originally set a deadline for July 18 to get a deal done, but extended it to Oct. 18 to help address regulatory concerns in the UK. &#8220;We’re grateful for the CMA’s thorough review and decision today,&#8221; Microsoft President Brad Smith said in a statement. &#8220;We have now crossed the final regulatory&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/uk-regulators-approve-microsofts-acquisition-of-activision-blizzard/">Read More</a>
