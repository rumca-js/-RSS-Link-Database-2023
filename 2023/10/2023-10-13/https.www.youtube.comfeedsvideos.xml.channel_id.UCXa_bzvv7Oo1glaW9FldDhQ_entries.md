When you think of Spider-Man, you invariably think of Venom. The two characters have been inextricably linked together ever since the latter's introduction in the 1980s, to the point where Venom has gone on to become not only one of Spider-Man's greatest villains – right up there alongside the likes of Green Goblin and Doctor Octopus – but also flat-out one of the best, most compelling, most popular comic book characters of all time.

Naturally then, when a major new Spider-Man story is on the horizon, fans are bound to wonder whether Venom will have a role to play. By now, over the course of two games, Insomniac has built out an excellent, authentic Spider-Man universe, and having teased Venom's introduction with both of its previous games, the developer is now ready to finally let the Symbiote break out of its cage. Alongside Kraven the Hunter, Venom has been confirmed as one of the main villains in Marvel's Spider-Man 2, and here, we're going to take a look at the character, his h

A new Sonic title is always a momentous occasion, and following the success of Sonic Frontiers and Sonic Mania, the franchise feels like it's on a roll. Sonic Superstars promises to take it in new directions with brand-new Zones, Emerald Powers and four-player co-op, a venerable first.

However, despite solid controls, interesting ideas and detailed environments, the platformer has several fundamental issues. Its lighting feels uneven and significantly worsens the presentation. The soundtrack is forgettable at best and poorly mixed at worst.

Yet, the level design, the Zones themselves, is the biggest offender. From excessively annoying gimmicks that ruin the flow and go against Sonic's fundamental appeal to tediously cumbersome co-op sections, they fight against the controls at every turn.

It's not the worst game in the series, but Sonic Superstars is the most disappointing in recent years.

At seemingly the eleventh hour, Sony has announced that new PS5 models will launch in November. They'll retail for the same price as the current models (except for those living in Japan) and offer much of the same internal hardware.

However, this is more than just a simple four-panel redesign. The new PS5 offers an attachable Ultra-HD Blu-ray disc drive, sold separately for PS5 Digital Edition owners to purchase. The internal storage has also increased to 1 TB, though there are no other changes to the internal hardware.

Until Sony says otherwise, this is essentially the slim version of the PS5. How much lighter is it? What else has changed? What's up with the new Vertical Stand? Find out more here.
