The dramatic saga – spanning three generations – reveals buried secrets and the ways that epic, earth-shattering events can reverberate through our lives.

## The Ahsoka Season Finale Reminds Us What's Wrong With Star Wars

Ahsoka wasn’t hamstrung by being a fifth season of a show not everyone watched, or people not understanding some character motivations or who other characters were entirely. In the end, the problem was that whether it was called Ahsoka Season 1 or Rebels Season 5, it didn’t end up being a season of television at all. Instead, it was individual nostalgia plays sprinkled through long patches of nothing. And what makes that so frustrating is that creator Dave Filoni absolutely rocks at delivering impactful, emotional, engaging and most importantly  original Star Wars stories. Or at least he usually does.

I want to be clear: I love the character Ahsoka. Hera Syndulla — criminally underused in this season — is one of the best contemporary Star Wars characters. I quickly grew to love Ezra Bridger after catching up on Rebels and meeting him in live-action in this new series. And there were even a couple of episodes of Ahsoka that really tugged at my Star Wars loving heart. The first two ep

In today's Fix of entertainment news:
Rick and Morty co-creator Dan Harmon has said that Zack Snyder wants a Rick and Morty movie. No, Snyder wouldn't have to direct, but he told Harmon he could use his 'Snyder-ness' to help make it happen. What that means is up to interpretation. Harmon is open to the possibility of a Rick and Morty movie, but he would want it done why the show is still popular. And, it still is, so...maybe a Rick and Morty movie soon? In other news, Crunchyroll is giving the fans what they want, and that's free anime. The company is helping to put together a free 24-hour anime channel, but don't expect it to play the latest hit shows straight from Japan. It will focus on older titles and it will be ad supported. So basically it's like TV from the days before streaming. Remember those?

In today's Daily Fix:

While PlayStation is getting slim and charging gamers more, Microsoft is doubling down on its cheaper Xbox Series S console and offering a new bundle later this month. The Starter Bundle will come with the white Xbox Series S, a contrller, and 3 months of Game Pass Ultimate for $299.99. Amazon is currently selling 3-month passes for Game Pass Ultimate for about $40, so that's not a bad deal, considering a 512gb Series S is already $299.99 by itself. In other news, the much maligned (and laughed at) Switch port of Mortal Kombat 1 just got an update, which the patch notes claim fixes some of the graphical and performance issues. And finally, developer Insomniac really did their homework with their version of the Lizard in Spider-Man 2, even studying real lizards to get it right.
