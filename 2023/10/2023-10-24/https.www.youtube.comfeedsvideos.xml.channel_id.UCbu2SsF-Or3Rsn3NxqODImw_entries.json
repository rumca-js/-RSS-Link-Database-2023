'Honest Game Trailers' head writer, Bailey Meyers, and GameSpot Senior Video Producer, Dave Klein, are in a race to achieve the Big Town Milestone, but they're going to have to contend with some interesting twists and turns that will make reaching this goal a little more interesting.\n\nVideo Notes:\nTimestamps:\n00:00 \u2013 00:21 | Intro\n00:22 \u2013 01:38 | Challenge Set Up\n01:39 \u2013 04:07 | Challenge 1\n04:08 \u2013 07:23 | Challenge 2\n07:24 \u2013 10:20 | Challenge 3\n10:21 \u2013 13:03 | Challenge 4\n13:03 \u2013 18:25 | Challenge 5\n18:26 \u2013 21:35 | Challenge 6\n21:36 \u2013 22:20 | Results\n22:21 \u2013 End | Outro/Credi", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HNgDWfyerA", "date_published": "2023-10-24T20:30:00+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GameSpot - YouTube", "album": "GameSpot - YouTube", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/6HNgDWfyerA/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Alan Wake Full Story Recap", "description": "After 13 years, one quasi-sequel, and one DLC tie-in, Remedy is finally returning to its well of inky darkness and releasing the sequel, Alan Wake 2.
