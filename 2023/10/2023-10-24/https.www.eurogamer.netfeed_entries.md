Microsoft has detailed its <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2024-q1/press-release-webcast">earnings for the first quarter of its 2024 fiscal year</a>, pointing to a record-breaking Q1 for Xbox gaming revenue, despite a 7% drop in hardware sales.
</p><p>
Over the course of Microsoft's Q1 2024, which runs from July to September, Xbox generated $3.9bn USD in gaming revenue - equating to a 9% year-on-year increase - which the company attributed to strong performance from first-party titles and Game Pass.
</p><p>
Not coincidentally, Xbox's <a href="https://x.com/DeekeTweak/status/1716916951556272546?s=20">record-breaking</a> Q1 encompassed the long-awaited launch of Bethesda's Starfield, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-hits-6m-players-to-become-biggest-bethesda-game-launch-ever">surpasse

Annapurna Interactive has published some very, very good games since its formation in 2016, and 12 of those titles will soon be bundled onto a single Switch cartridge; the only catch - and it's admittedly quite a big one - is that it'll cost you an almighty $200.
</p><p>
The region-free Annapurna Interactive Deluxe Limited Edition Collection, as the mega-priced cartridge is officially known, is being released in collaboration with video game collectibles company iam8bit and is restricted to 2,500 copies.
</p><p>
For your hard-earned $199.99 USD (plus, of course, a hefty chunk of VAT and import fees if you're ordering from the UK), you'll get a cartridge continuing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donut-county-review-a-simple-physics-based-puzz

Nintendo has released strict new guidelines for the smaller-scale competitive tournament scene, outlining exactly what it will permit - with caps on everything from competitor numbers to ticket prices - before organisers must apply for an official license from the company.
</p><p>
As detailed in its <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Legal-information/Community-Tournament-Guidelines-2467744.html">new Community Tournament Guidelines</a> - which were initially published by Nintendo of Japan before appearing in locally adjusted form on Nintendo of Europe's website earlier today - tournaments will be permitted to continue without a license after 15th November this year, provided they are "small-scale and not for commercial profit".

More specifically, these strictly limited events - which Nintendo is terming "community tour

Insomniac Games has delivered another new game for the console that pushes back technological boundaries, which a denser, richer representation of New York City, expanded to include Brooklyn and Queens, while the core rendering itself features dramatic improvements in ray traced reflections, along with the introduction of RT reflections on bodies of water. Meanwhile, the studio firmly embraces the potential of the game's SSD with streaming that allows for more dramatic and faster traversal through the city, along with some spectacular streaming-based set-pieces.</p><p>In our tech review of the game, we had plenty of theories about how some of Insomniac's tech had been enhanced over Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered and Miles Morales, but we were

That means streaming simultaneously on Twitch as well as competitor platforms like YouTube and Kick.

It's a move that will help streamers grow their viewership both on and off the platform, even while Twitch develops further tools to aid with growth like the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-introducing-stories-and-discovery-feed-to-boost-offline-community-interaction">recent Discovery Feed and Stories</a>.

Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol 1 launches today, and fans have already found references to the games they expect to be featured in Konami's still-to-be-announced Vol 2. 
</p><p>
As a reminder, this initial collection is centred around MGS1, 2 and 3. But back in June,  <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-looks-like-metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-will-include-mgs4">Konami's website appeared to suggest a future Vol 2 would continue</a> by including MGS4, 5 and Peace Walker.
</p><p>
Now Vol 1 is released, that's exactly what the game's own files also suggest - via references to all three of those games spotted in its code by fans on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/17fa09z/metal_gear_solid_peace_walker_4_and_5_r

Instead of numbers, however, you combine round fruits within a set amount of space. The aim is to make a massive watermelon (which is pronounced suika in Japanese).</p><p>The game was first released in Japan on Switch in December 2021 and has since sold over 2m copies.

A demo has been released for retro survival horror game Crow Country.
</p><p>
From the developer behind Snipperclips and Tangle Tower, this is quite the change of pace.
</p><p>
Its aesthetic is part Final Fantasy 7 and part Resident Evil 1, with polygonal characters, 3D environments reminiscent of pre-rendered backgrounds, and classic survival horror gameplay. Check it out in the trailer below.

</p><p>Need for Spirit Drink &amp; Drive Simulator was released for the Switch on 15th October, and contains gameplay of a "hapless professional driver tasked with delivering alcoholic beverages to various celebrations, all while battling the perils of abysmal roads and your very own addiction to the booze you're transporting".
</p><p>With "immersive camera modes" and an added "exciting twist" of drunk vision, the game is (yes) a drink driving simulator. Its <a href="https://pegi.info/what-do-the-labels-mean">PEGI 3+ rating</a> suggests the game is suitable for all age groups. PEGI however states a game which "refers to or depicts the use of illegal drugs, alcohol or tobacco" must be la

Platforming mascot Astrobot assists with the pre-match coin toss, while Kratos and Atreus watch from the stands, the former blowing his magical horn.

Diablo 4 players believe they've made a breakthrough discovery in the hunt for a non-existent secret cow level.
</p><p>
As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-4-players-are-hunting-for-a-non-existent-secret-cow-level">reported back in June</a>, players have been seeking a secret cow level in the game, something that began as an urban myth in the original Diablo but was acknowledged by Blizzard in later games.
</p><p>
Blizzard has so far denied the existence of a cow level in Diablo 4, with general manager Rod Fergusson telling Kinda Funny the development team "wanted to ground [Diablo 4] as much as possible". That hasn't stopped players searching for it, however.

European police have "taken down" the gang of ransomware attackers responsible for 2020's high-profile Capcom hack, which saw confidential employee information and details on a swathe of upcoming games splashed across the internet.
</p><p>
The Ragnar Locker ransomware group was arrested at a string of addresses across the continent, in raids conducted last week in Czechia, Spain and Latvia, Europol has said. 
</p><p>
Action against the group began on 16th October with the arrest of a "key target" in Paris, prompting a search of his Czechia home.

Since he was about seven years old, Mark Vanhoenacker has liked to imagine his own city. "Its location changes occasionally, as does its name. But no matter where I draw it or what I call it, it's the same city to me."
</p><p>
Vanhoenacker is a British Airways pilot, and the author of two of my favourite books. The first, Skyfaring, is a glorious hymn to flying, and to doing a job that you love. The second, Imagine a City, is a pilot's perspective on cities real and, in this case, imagined.
</p><p>
Why a city? For Vanhoenacker, it's a place to travel to when he's sad or worried, or when "I don't wish to think about what I don't like about myself." It's the melancholic starting point for a generous, enveloping, far-ranging book. You must read it. But anyway...
