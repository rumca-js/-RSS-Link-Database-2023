<p>Motorola showcased some wacky concepts at Lenovo Tech World ’23 that may or may not ever see the light of day. The smartphone maker (a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-10-30-lenovo-luvs-motorola-4-lyfe.html">subsidiary of Lenovo</a> since 2014) unveiled an “adaptive display” prototype that can be rolled into a phone, stand or smart bracelet. (It looks like a more advanced version of a prototype <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-06-09-a-closer-look-at-lenovos-bendy-concept-phone-and-tablet.html">Lenovo exhibited</a> in 2016.) In addition, the company highlighted several developmental AI-powered features for the Lenovo devices you can already buy.</p>
<p>The display concept is a rollable smartphone with an FHD+ pOLED display.

<p>The moon has been a focal point for space research and exploration for years, yet we’re still far from fully understanding its origins. Take its age, for example – researchers have just discovered that the moon is about 40 million years older than previously thought.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.geochemicalperspectivesletters.org/article2334/"><ins>study published</ins></a> by the European Association of Geochemistry, scientists looked at the age of crystal formations found in rock samples from the moon’s surface to determine its age. The prevalence of crystals called zircon in the samples, collected years ago from NASA’s Apollo program, suggests that the surface of the moon was created around 110 million years after the formation of the solar system. The scientists used analytical techniques including mass spectrometry to measure the presence of particular molecules in the rock. Another method of analysis, atom-probe tomography, was used to detect the amount of radioactive de

You get the titular Super Lead based on the classic tube amp, the Super Bass inspired by the 1967 low-end icon and the Brown, which emulates the sound of a 100-watt Marshall Plexi heading into a Variac to recreate Eddie Van Halen’s infamous guitar tone.</p>
<p>This is a modern pedal with high-tech features, however, so it goes well beyond simple amp recreations. The onboard IR includes recreations of different classic microphones and speaker cabinets to adjust the sound. There’s also built-in reverb, volume boost, presence and a variety of assignable preset switches that are customized by using a smartphone app. There are also plenty of artist presets to select from if yo

<p>Qualcomm is no stranger in running artificial intelligence and machine learning systems on-device and without an internet connection. They’ve been doing it with their camera chipsets for years. But on Tuesday at Snapdragon Summit 2023, the company announced that on-device AI is finally coming to mobile devices and Windows 11 PCs as part of the new Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 and X Elite chips.</p>
<p>Both chipsets were built from the ground up with generative AI capabilities in mind and are able to support a variety of large language models (LLM), language vision models (LVM), and transformer network-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) models, up to 10 billion parameters for the SD8 gen 3 and 13 billion parameters for the X Elite, entirely on-device. That means you’ll be able to run anything from Baidu’s ERNIE 3.5 to OpenAI’s Whisper, Meta's Llama 2 or Google’s Gecko on your phone or laptop, without an internet connection. Qualcomm’s chips are optimized for voice, text and image input

<p>At its annual Snapdragon Summit on Tuesday, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/qualcomm/"><ins>Qualcomm</ins></a> revealed its latest mobile chipset. Perhaps the biggest change in the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 is the introduction of on-device generative AI (akin to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-tensor-g3-soc-pixel-8-pro-143052356.html">Google's Tensor G3</a>). The chipset’s AI Engine supports multi-modal generative AI models and what Qualcomm claims is the world’s fastest Stable Diffusion system with the ability to generate an image in under a second. So, you should be able to whip up backgrounds and images for social media posts in a flash.</p>
<p>Because GAI requests are handled on-device, Qualcomm says they remain private.

<p>The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) announced Tuesday that it has suspended GM-owned Cruise’s permits to operate driverless vehicles in the state — effective immediately. The suspension was based on several safety-related issues. It isn’t yet clear if the move is directly related to an incident earlier this month when <a href="https://www.engadget.com/a-pedestrian-was-pinned-under-a-cruise-robotaxi-after-another-cars-hit-and-run-180404816.html">a Cruise robotaxi pinned a pedestrian under its tire</a> in San Francisco after another car’s hit-and-run.</p>
<p>According to an emailed statement the California DMV supplied to Engadget, the suspension was based on safety-related regulations. These include:</p>

<p>The crowded field of Twitter clones has just winnowed a bit, as Pebble has officially exited the game, announced via an email to <em>Engadget. </em>The social media site, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/a-new-twitter-alternative-is-trying-to-lure-users-about-to-lose-their-old-checkmark-160011153.html"><ins>formerly called T2 Social,</ins></a> was actually created by ex-Twitter employees and this announcement occurs just five weeks <a href="https://www.engadget.com/would-be-x-competitor-t2-social-is-now-called-pebble-no-not-that-pebble-150021871.html"><ins>after the rebrand to Pebble.</ins></a></p>
<p>The company is transparent when it comes to the reasoning behind the closure, saying “we were not growing quickly enough for investors to believe that we will break out.” Pebble also noted the crowded field of competitors and the “uphill climb” to garner traffic and sustained use. It simply needed more time to “build out a complete Pebble”, but investors put the kibosh on that idea.

<p>Whether you’re just dipping your toes into smart home automation or adding new devices to your growing setup, there have never been more IoT gadgets for you to choose from. But before you dive in, we have some advice. For one, don’t try to outfit your entire smart home with all new products in one go – that goes for both newbies and those familiar with smart home gadgets. Not only can this be quite expensive (especially as a homeowner), we think it’s generally best to buy just one or two items first to see if you like them, or to see how they pair with the rest of your place’s ecosystem. And if you haven’t already, you should decide which voice assistant you prefer.

<p>Google has disabled live traffic updates for Israel and Gaza in Maps and Waze, a spokesperson has confirmed to <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-23/google-disables-live-traffic-in-israel-gaza-at-military-request?leadSource=uverify%20wall&amp;sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>. "As we have done previously in conflict situations and in response to the evolving situation in the region, we have temporarily disabled the ability to see live traffic conditions and busyness information out of consideration for the safety of local communities," the spokesperson said. Israeli blog <a href="https://www.geektime.co.il/waze-google-maps-and-apple-maps-in-israel-will-not-display-traffic-and-more/"><em>GeekTime</em></a> reports that Apple has switched off the same feature in its Maps app, as well.</p>

<p>While Apple, Meta and others continue to work with full-on headsets for augmented reality (AR), Nreal has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nreal-air-augmented-reality-glasses-130059945.html">selling much smaller AR glasses</a> since 2021. Now the company, which has rebranded to Xreal, just released a new version called the <a href="https://us.shop.xreal.com/products/xreal-air-2">Xreal Air 2</a> in <a href="https://us.shop.xreal.com/products/xreal-air-2">Europe and the US</a>, after <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/tech/xreal-air-2-ar-glasses-first-major-launch-for-rebranded-nreal-2283047/">launching it</a> in China last month. It offers improved displays and more comfort, and the company also unveiled the Xreal Air 2 Pro with electrochromic dimming, letting you select the level of immersion from zero to 100 percent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tinder’s new feature is a new nightmare to me. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tinder-will-let-your-family-nag-you-and-play-virtual-matchmaker-100011319.html">Tinder Matchmaker</a> allows users’ family and friends to recommend potential matches. Wannabe matchmakers do not need a Tinder profile to view or suggest possible pairings, so anyone you know could help you find the one. Or at least... another one.</p>
<p>The Tinder user will need to launch a “Tinder Matchmaker session” either from a profile card or within the app’s settings. You can share a unique link with up to 15 individuals in a 24-hour period. Once a matchmaker gets a link, they can log into Tinder or continue as a guest to swipe away. Don’t worry: They can't send messages or actually swipe right on the profiles.</p>
<p>Both Hinge and Bumble have already tried matchmaking, although the former’s attempts didn’t last – the dedicated Hinge matchmaking app is no longer available.</p>

<p>From Hollywood strikes to digital portraits, AI's potential to steal creatives' work and how to stop it has dominated the tech conversation in 2023. The latest effort to protect artists and their creations is Nightshade, a tool allowing artists to add undetectable pixels into their work that could corrupt an AI's training data, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/10/23/1082189/data-poisoning-artists-fight-generative-ai/">the <em>MIT Technology Review</em> reports.</a> Nightshade's creation comes as major companies like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sarah-silverman-sues-openai-and-meta-over-copyright-infringement-175322447.html">OpenAI and Meta face lawsuits for copyright infringement</a> and stealing personal works without compensation.</p>

<p>GM has announced that it will pay $1,400 to owners of 2020-2022 Bolt EVs and EUVs who endured a recall that limited range to 80 percent for a significant period of time, <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/10/23/gm-offers-1400-to-20-22-chevy-bolt-owners-who-dont-get-battery-replacement/"><em>Electrek</em></a> has reported.

## NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission collected more Bennu asteroid samples than first thought

<p>NASA has revealed that it has already <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/osiris-rex/2023/10/20/nasas-osiris-rex-achieves-sample-mass-milestone/">processed 70.3 grams</a> of rocks and dust collected by the OSIRIS-REx mission from asteroid Bennu. That means the mission has way exceeded its goal of bringing 60 grams of asteroid samples back to Earth — especially since NASA scientists have yet to open the primary sample container that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasas-osiris-rex-successfully-delivers-asteroid-samples-back-to-earth-091107901.html">made its way back to our planet</a> in September.

<p>Amazon, the biggest e-commerce website in most countries, now <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-passwordless-sign-in-passkey">supports passkeys</a>. That gives users access to the new login solution that's considered more secure than passwords, allowing them to access their account using the biometrics or PIN they use to unlock their devices. The company started <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/23/amazon-adds-support-for-passkeys/">rolling out</a> the capability <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/17/amazon-passkey-sign-in/">a few days ag</a>o but has only just announced the feature, which is now available on browsers and is gradually making its way to all users accessing Amazon through its iOS app. Passkey support is also &quot;coming soon&quot; to Amazon's Android application.&nbsp;</p>
