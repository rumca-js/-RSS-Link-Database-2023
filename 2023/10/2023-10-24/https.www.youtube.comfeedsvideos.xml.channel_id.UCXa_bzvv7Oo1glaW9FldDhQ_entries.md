After multiple attempts over the last thirteen years, Remedy Entertainment is finally about to release Alan Wake 2, and for fans of the original 2010 psychological thriller cult classic, the excitement is palpable.

There’s also a trademark issue raging in full force, and there are plenty of burning questions within the minds of fans regarding the very legitimacy of the project. With this feature, we will be diving deep into the circumstances surrounding the game and try to decipher what exactly is going on here?
