The Seattle-based e-commerce company laid off more employees on Tuesday. It&#8217;s unclear how many people lost their job. We&#8217;ve reached out to the company for more details. Affected employees told GeekWire they did not receive severance. The company has gone through multiple rounds of layoffs over the past year-and-a-half, including two rounds under its new owner Regent, a Los Angeles-based private equity firm. The latest cuts come just after CEO Terry Boyle announced internally his decision to leave the company, effective Oct. 31. Zulily\u00a0previously laid off staff in June, and did not provide severance&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2023/more-layoffs-hit-zulily-in-latest-cuts-at-online-retailer/\">Read More</a>", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2023/more-layoffs-hit-zulily-in-latest-cuts-at-online-retailer", "date_published": "2023-10-24T20:31:41+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GeekWire", "album": "GeekWire", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://www.geekwire.com/wp-content/themes/geekwire/dist/images/geekwire-logo-rss.png"}, {"source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed/", "title": "Microsoft tops revenue and profit expectations as Nadella cites coming age of AI", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"840\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/20190506_Microsoft_Build_108-1260x840.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />Microsoft topped expectations with revenue of $56.5 billion, an increase of 13% year-over-year, and earnings of $2.99 per share, up 27%, with increased cloud revenue foreshadowing strong interest in its artificial intelligence technology.

That&#8217;s according to a new report called Cities on the Tech Frontier, which assessed regional competitiveness based on the concentration of tech workers with highly valued in-demand skills, such as artificial intelligence and cloud computing. The Seattle area ranked No. 1 among regions with at least 25,000 tech workers, edging out Silicon Valley, Boston, and Austin. Seattle also ranked atop a separate &#8220;momentum list,&#8221; which measured general tech-related employment growth between 2017 and 2021, as well as growth in jobs requiring highly valued skills.

The gift follows Amazon&#8217;s efforts this summer to deliver essential supplies to Maui after wildfires that razed the town of Lahaina, and builds on regional events that connected low-income kids with back-to-school supplies. These recent charitable acts aren&#8217;t giant headline grabbing events, but taken together demonstrate Amazon&#8217;s evolving identity as a corporation that is engaged in philanthropy and civic issues. \u201cWe\u2019re out there,&#8221;&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2023/amazon-keeps-fueling-philan", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2023/amazon-keeps-fueling-philanthropic-efforts-under-leadership-of-former-nonprofit-executive/", "date_published": "2023-10-24T00:20:36+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GeekWire", "album": "GeekWire", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://www.geekwire.com/wp-content/themes/geekwire/dist/images/geekwire-logo-rss.png"}]
