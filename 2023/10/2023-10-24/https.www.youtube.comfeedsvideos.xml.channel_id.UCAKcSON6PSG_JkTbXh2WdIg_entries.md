Leeds band Yard Act shored up their emerging sound during an unlikely time; specifically, in the midst of the global pandemic. “I have a lot of respect and space for people that didn't catch that creative break that we did,” Yard Act frontman James Smith reflects, “but we did, and we made the most of it.”

Nominated for the 2022 Mercury Prize for their debut album The Overload, it’s been a whirlwind for Yard Act ever since the world began reopening. The band’s earlier forays into North America had been primarily restricted to the coasts, but September of 2023 saw the band carve a slice across the American Midwest, with shows in Minneapolis; Madison, Wisconsin; and Chicago. During Yard Act’s visit to Minnesota, they visited The Current for a studio session hosted by Jill Riley.

Watch and listen to the complete session above.
