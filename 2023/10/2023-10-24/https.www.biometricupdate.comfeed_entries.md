		Belgium’s digital identity industry is consolidating, with the acquisition of Leuven-based <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/nextauth">nextAuth</a> by <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/itsme">itsme</a>.

<a href="https://www.nextauth.com/">NextAuth</a> is a spinoff from prominent university KU Leuven and imec (Intrauniversity Microelectronics Centre). The startup provides passwordless multi-factor authentication with native mobile device biometrics, along with e-signatures.

The acquisition represents the next step in itsme’s expansion, the company says, with the integration of nextAuth’s biometric, passwordless MFA into the itsme app. The integration will provide stronger end-to-end authentication within the app, itsme says.

		As the fifth round of trilogue negotiations on the European Union's proposed <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/ai-act">AI Act</a> began this week in the EU Council, moving the massive legislation <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202309/biometric-surveillance-will-be-debated-until-the-final-stages-of-ai-act">closer</a> to finalization, the algorithm community is rushing in with make-or-break demands.

For instance, MEP Dragoș Tudorache, Parliament's Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs Committee rapporteur, has outlined three "major blocks" to negotiations.

One of them is the number of exemptions that the EU Council is advocating for law enforcement. This matter is intrinsically tied to facial recognition, a tool few police or intelligence giv

		India is bleeding biometric information, with new data breaches giving credence to a <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202309/indian-govt-fires-back-at-moodys-sweeping-assertions-about-aadhaar-biometrics">recent report</a> by the credit rating agency Moody’s warning that Aadhaar’s centralized biometric digital ID system has privacy and security vulnerabilities.

A piece in Security Affairs <a href="https://securityaffairs.com/152957/security/pii-indian-citizens-dark-web.html?amp=1">reports</a> that earlier this month, the cybersecurity firm Resecurity found hundreds of millions of records containing personally identifiable information (PII) for sale on the dark web.

<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202304/what-are-passkeys-and-how-do-they-work">Passkeys</a> allow individuals to use their face, fingerprint, or PIN to sign into apps and websites without passwords.

		Two of the world's most rigidly authoritarian regimes have deep-seated problems with Islam and intend to erase their problems using heavy oppression backed by biometric surveillance.

The nations are Afghanistan and China, and a weirder pair of biometrics allies is hard to find. They share a short mountain border and not much else.

Afghanistan roots out any religion except Deobandi Islamic fundamentalism. Its government is a buyer of facial recognition systems deployed to purify the culture.

China's autocratic and opposition-phobic leaders would like to end religious thought and practice altogether, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202112/biometric-mass-surveillance-pitched-in-alleged-huawei-company-materials">especially</a> that of the nation's larg

		The controversial Tbilisi-based facial recognition website <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/pimeyes">PimEyes</a>, which lets users upload photos of anonymous people and scrapes the Internet for matches, is causing new concerns in Australia, where police have tested the biometric tool, according to a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/oct/24/australian-federal-police-afp-pimeyes-facial-recognition-facecheck-id-search-engine-platform">report</a> in the Guardian.

A freedom of information request by the news organization shows that Australian federal police (AFP) devices logged hundreds of network connections to PimEyes between January and August 2023, ten of which were identified as being for operational purposes.

		The southern African nations of Namibia and Zambia have agreed to assist each other in their Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS), as well as legal and digital identity management pursuits.

A recent trip by officials of Zambia’s National Registration, Passport and Citizenship Department to Windhoek has laid the foundation for this collaboration, the Namibia Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) <a href="https://nbcnews.na/node/103118">reports</a>.

During the discussions, officials of both neighbouring countries explained how their CRVS and ID systems function particularly in terms of the infrastructure and architecture, interoperability, the legal and regulatory frameworks, the kind of technologies used such as biometrics, data security and management approaches as well as th
