It's easier than ever to take your town from Tiny Village to Thriving Metropolis in the most realistic city builder ever: Cities Skylines: II. That is, if you're playing without the added challenge of say, having to get creative with the new and improved Road Builder?

Skull Island: Rise of Kong caused a lot of commotion when it seemingly came out of nowhere, but Kurt thinks there's a bigger lesson to learn from this notorious game.

Skull Island: Rise of Kong flooded social media feeds with its wonky gameplay and half-baked aesthetics, quickly being called the "worst game of 2023," and some even labeling it a scam. For Kurt, however, the bad press only made him more curious. 

In this installment of The Kurt Locker, Kurt uses Skull Island: Rise of Kong as an example of how we can sometimes interpret and digest information, and the knee jerk reaction to shame something before understanding the whole story.
