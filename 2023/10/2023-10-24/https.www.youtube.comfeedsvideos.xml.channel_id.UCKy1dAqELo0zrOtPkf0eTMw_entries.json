Few video game missions can claim to be as well known or as polarising as No Russian. The fourth mission of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is the unforgettable story of a deadly terrorist attack. It infamously involves the mass shooting of civilians, a seemingly reckless idea for a piece of entertainment. But behind the shock value and bad press is the tale of a team that dared to push interactive storytelling to its very limits. \n\nTo find out how No Russian was put together IGN spoke to designer Mohammad Alavi, who created the mission alongside colleagues at Infinity Ward. With his insight, we look at how No Russian makes use of player discomfort, tightly-controlled pacing, and limited interactivity to create Modern Warfare 2\u2019s shocking twist.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #CallOfDuty", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Y02u92e_8", "date_published": "2023-10-24T14:00:15+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "Ign - YouTube", "album": "Ign - YouTube", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/Q-Y02u92e_8/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Persona 3 Reload - Official 'The Undefeated Brawler' Trailer", "description": "Meet Akihiko Sanada and see the character in action in this latest trailer for the upcoming RPG remake, Persona 3 Reload.
