As a sequel to the acclaimed 2020 action-adventure title, One More Level's Ghostrunner 2 expands on the core gameplay. Set one year later, Jack returns as the protagonist to combat a new threat to the Tower. That means more platforming, slashing and Cybervoid-venturing.

While Ghostrunner 2 maintains the same killer presentation and pulsating soundtrack, it also layers in new mechanics, like motorcycle sections, Ultimates, revamped progression and new enemies. Each level offers something fresh to tackle while pushing you to the limits of capability (and sanity).

Despite some encounters requiring a bit of retuning, some bugs and iffy dialogues, One More Level's follow-up is a fast-paced, tense experience which almost constantly throws new things and challenges you to come out on top.

Alan Wake 2 is set up to be a survival horror remix of Remedy Entertainment’s favorite atmospheric thriller, promising a complex, interweaving storyline combining the shuffling terror of horror with detective-led gameplay. 

New protagonist Agent Saga Anderson is joining Alan in this new adventure; her real-world investigation into a series of ritualistic murders in Bright Falls contrasting neatly with Alan’s attempts to escape from a shapeshifting Dark Place. 

The one-two punch of flashlight before gunfire returns for this sequel but there’s a wealth of fresh mechanics in this long-awaited follow up too, highlighting Remedy’s ambition to craft their longest, most mind-warping title to date. This sequel looks fantastic and has every chance to be amongst the top-ranking games come the end of the year.

Super Mario Bros. Wonder is a statement of intent. With Wonder, it shows us that 2D Mario is no longer content to stay in its 3D siblings’ shadow, and will instead be every bit the genre leading property that Mario should be. 

By re-injecting a healthy dose of whimsy and, yes, wonder back into proceedings, Super Mario Bros. Wonder makes the case for being one of the best 2D platformer games of all time, Mario or otherwise.

Metal Gear Solid features some of the most influential, critically praised stealth action titles out there, and the first three 3D titles are now playable on modern platforms thanks to Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Volume 1. Alongside featuring Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Solid 2 and Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, the collection also features some interesting extra goodies for fans of the franchise.

Alongside the addition of digital graphic novels, screenplays, and master books, the collection also includes gameplay extras, like Metal Gear Solid’s VR missions, or Metal Gear Solid 3’s European Extreme difficulty options. The only major downside to the collection is that its soundtrack isn’t quite as comprehensive as it should have been, with many tracks outright missing altogether.
