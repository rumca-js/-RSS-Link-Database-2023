Three of the hubs are located in the Pacific Northwest: The hubs will span 32 states and Puerto Rico and are designed to bring together private industry, state and local governments, institutions of higher education, labor unions, Tribal communities and nonprofit organizations. In addition to the 31 tech hubs, 18 &#8220;Strategy Development Grants&#8221; have been awarded to build economic development plans to compete for future rounds of the Tech&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2023/white-house-names-31-tech-hubs-in-u-s-including-aerospace-mass-timber-microfluidics-efforts-in-nw/\">Read More</a>", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2023/white-house-names-31-tech-hubs-in-u-s-including-aerospace-mass-timber-microfluidics-efforts-in-nw/", "date_published": "2023-10-23T21:11:13+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GeekWire", "album": "GeekWire", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://www.geekwire.com/wp-content/themes/geekwire/dist/images/geekwire-logo-rss.png"}, {"source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed/", "title": "OneBusAway needs \u2018influx of cash\u2019 to hire dedicated developer and keep popular transit app running", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"316\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/onebusaway.png\" width=\"307\" /><br />OneBusAway, the beloved app that delivers real-time information to public transportation riders, needs help to keep the bus and train data moving on time.

However, investors will be watching its quarterly report Tuesday for hints of AI&#8217;s long-term impact on the company and the broader industry. Microsoft&#8217;s results will serve as &#8220;a major bellwether for cloud spend and especially the appetite for generative AI spend among CIOs,&#8221; writes Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives in a note to clients previewing the tech earnings week ahead.
