<p>You probably already know that 5G is a widely used abbreviation for a version of mobile network standards. (Also, that it&rsquo;s the most current standard in use.) That &ldquo;G&rdquo; slapped next to the number means &ldquo;generation.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not a reference to the download or upload speeds you get on your cell phone.</p>



<p>You also may have already seen the advertisements about Comcast&rsquo;s new 10G Xfinity network blanketing the airwaves and other platforms. And since the Xfinity website <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.xfinity.com/10g&amp;xcust=2-1-1662111-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">doesn&rsquo;t really clarify what &ldquo;10G&rdquo; means</a>, you might assume that the company&rsquo;s home internet service is a faster version of 5G.

<p>Blizzard has come up with a very special competition to fuel a blood donation campaign: It&rsquo;s giving away a high-end Diablo IV-themed gaming PC whose water cooling system is infused with &ldquo;real human blood&rdquo; if players donate enough of the life-giving liquid.</p>



<p>In the &ldquo;Diablo IV Blood Harvest&rdquo; blood drive, the Diablo community aims to collectively donate 666 quarts of blood (the equivalent of around 640 liters). The entire Diablo community will benefit from this, as hitting 220 quarts, 440 quarts, and 666 quarts will also unlock various cosmetic items in the Diablo 4 game. Once the blood donation goal has been reached, the competition for the custom gaming PC, which is infused with &ldquo;real human blood&rdquo; to some degree, will start.</p>
