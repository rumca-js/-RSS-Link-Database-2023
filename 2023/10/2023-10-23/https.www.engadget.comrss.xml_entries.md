<p>Nvidia is reportedly planning on making Arm-based chips for Windows PCs. <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-make-arm-based-pc-chips-major-new-challenge-intel-2023-10-23/">According to</a> <em>Reuters,</em> the company has “quietly begun” taking on Intel by designing processors compatible with Microsoft’s operating system. The report says Nvidia could begin selling the chips as early as 2025.</p>
<p>The move is part of Microsoft’s broader goal of challenging Apple with Arm-based processors for Windows PCs. According to preliminary Q3 data from research firm IDC, the iPhone maker has nearly doubled its market share since launching the Arm-based <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-silicon-m1-mac-181040846.html">Apple Silicon</a> three years ago.

<p>Meta is starting to ramp up its growth-hacking tactics for Threads in a bid to boost engagement on the Twitter competitor. The social network is promoting its newest app by cross-posting Threads posts to users’ Facebook feeds, the company confirmed Monday.</p>
<p>It’s a familiar move for Meta, which regularly uses the Facebook feed to promote new features, including those from its other apps. The company has inserted Instagram Reels into recommendations in Facebook’s feed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-reels-news-feed-launch-150057328.html"><ins>for years</ins></a>, and also allows businesses on WhatsApp to buy ads that appear in Facebook feeds. But unlike those efforts, it seems that Threads promotions on Facebook are not optional.</p>

<p>Netflix has dropped a trailer for the upcoming reality series <em>Squid Game: The Challenge</em>. The forthcoming show starts with 456 contestants competing for a $4.56 million prize in events repackaged (minus the brutal violence) from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-squid-game-season-two-confirmed-140703749.html">scripted series</a>. What better way to follow a fictional critique of modern capitalism’s exploitation of the financially desperate for profit and entertainment than to embrace a reality TV spectacle that exploits the financially desperate for profit and entertainment?</p>
<p>Among other games ripped from the South Korean show, the competition’s trailer showcases the original series’ creepy “red light, green light” doll as players in green tracksuits nervously scoot across the floor, ready to stop at a moment’s notice. (In this version, the “gunshots” fired at infringing players involve pre-placed blood packets exploding on their chests.) In standard real

However, those who use both Apple's speakers and Google's music streaming service may be pleased to learn that the two now play more nicely together. YouTube Music is now available natively on HomePod, meaning that you can ask Siri to play tracks from the service even if your iPhone, iPad or Apple Watch aren't close by.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's now possible to set YouTube Music as the default music service on HomePod. That means you won't have to add &quot;on YouTube Music&quot; when you bark a command at Siri. If you configure your HomePod in that way, you can still play music from another supported service by saying its name when you make your Siri request (for example &quot;Siri, play Bad Bunny on Deezer&quot; or &

The news came from a short teaser video the streaming service posted on its social channels, including <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CyvtHPvLmM8/">Instagram</a>, styled like a Pip-Boy interface. The series, initially <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fallout-amazon-video-series-announced-172346835.html">announced</a> in 2020, will adopt a “serious and harsh” tone while adding “ironic humor” and “B-movie nuclear fantasies.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The live-action series, from <em>Westworld</em> creators Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, will have an original (canonical) story set in the Fallout gaming universe. It will take place in 2077, beginning in Vault 33 in Los Angeles. As fans of the game know, it’s set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland fo

<p>The United States Justice Department says North Korean nationals have been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/doj-says-north-korean-it-workers-were-sent-abroad-to-help-finance-weapons-programs-101824065.html">working remotely</a> for US companies, using fake IDs. The money they make is apparently being funneled to fund weapons of mass destruction programs. At a news conference in St. Louis, Missouri, the FBI alleged that thousands of individuals have moved to countries such as Russia and China and posed as freelance IT workers living in the US.</p>
<p>They used false information for emails, payment platforms and websites — sometimes even paying Americans to use their Wi-Fi and setting up proxy computers from those connections. The money being made here was substantial, too. The FBI has apparently collected around $1.5 million in money earned by these workers during previously sealed seizures in October 2022 and January 2023.</p>

<p>Tinder has rolled out a new feature dubbed “Tinder Matchmaker” that will allow users’ family and friends to access the dating app and make recommendations for potential matches. The matchmakers do not need to have a Tinder profile to view or suggest possible pairings. Hypothetically, that means anyone from your grandmother to your ex-boyfriend could help you select a new profile to match with.</p>
<p>A Tinder user will need to launch a “Tinder Matchmaker session” either directly from a profile card or within the app’s settings. If you see a potential match, you can share a unique link with up to 15 individuals in a 24-hour period. Once a matchmaker gets a link, they can log into Tinder or continue as a guest.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A matchmaker will gain access to profiles they can “like” and if they do, it will appear as a recommendation for the original Tinder user to see. The matchmaker’s abilities are limited though. They can't send messages or actually s
