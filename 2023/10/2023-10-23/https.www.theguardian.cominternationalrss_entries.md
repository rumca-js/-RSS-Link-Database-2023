## Bishan Bedi was an effortless bowler but a determined fighter for cricket

<p>Former Indian captain became a legend and inspiration to many but never thought he was bigger than the game or its fans</p><p>One of cricket’s iconic photographs is of Bishan Singh Bedi arriving at the crease to deliver the ball, feet scissored, right arm upright as if settling on a target, head looking over his leading shoulder, about to let go of the ball. The slow left-arm orthodox spinner, one of the greatest to grace the game, was languid in his approach and delivery. This belied the spiteful bite and the disguised deception he could impart to a ball.</p><p>You could take a still photograph of Bedi at any point in his approach and it would be a picture of poise and balance. If you gave a sculptor countless hours to chisel away at marble, they would not be able to produce a more perfect action, devoid of frills and fancies, economical to the point of being minimalist.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/oct/23/bishan-bedi-effortless-bowler-determined-fighter-fo

<p>England winger praises ‘scientific, Spock-like approach’ of head coach who he insists can ‘crack the code to rugby’</p><p>Steve Borthwick is a genius who can “crack the code to rugby” according to the England winger Jonny May, who compared his head coach to the mathematician Alan Turing. Often described as the “father of computer science”, Turing broke the Nazi Enigma code during the second world war. May’s praise does not stop there, drawing parallels between Borthwick and Star Trek’s Spock.</p><p>If those are colourful compliments to pay a head coach, they demonstrate the esteem in which May holds Borthwick and, in turn, how he feels about the future of the national side after their improbable run to the last four of the World Cup in France.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/oct/23/turing-spock-borthwick-england-coach-jonny-may-rugby-world-cup">Continue reading...</a>
