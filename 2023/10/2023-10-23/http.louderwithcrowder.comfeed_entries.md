	2021 vs 2023. While I was working on the site over the weekend, I was reminded of this Tom Aharon clip. He's referred to as "Israel's John Oliver." Aharon had responded to Oliver's HBO show on 2021's conflict where -- spoiler -- the British "comedian" blamed Israel with similar talking points you're hearing now.

	2021's Israel-Palestine War saw a more humane side of Hamas. Instead of raping, murdering, beheading, mutilating, and kidnapping women and children, they just indiscriminately fired rockets. It encouraged copycats in New York City, where Jews were assaulted with explosive devices. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nyc-jewish-palestinian-hate-crime" target="_blank">Critics called it the "AOC Effect"</a> referencing <a href="https://www.jpost.com/international/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-calls-israel-an-ap
