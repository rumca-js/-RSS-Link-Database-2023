You may remember this teaser image Prime Video released last year to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Fallout franchise, which was our first glimpse at the upcoming live-action series. The tweet read, ‘Congratulations and happy 25th birthday! We made something special for the occasion.’ Something special being a live-action adaptation of the #Fallout franchise coming to the Amazon streaming service. We see in the image a couple of Vault dwellers wearing the iconic Vault 33 jumpsuits. As we inch ever so closer to the show’s release window, we now know exactly when to expect it to hit Prime Video: April 12th, 2024. This was revealed via Pip-Boy in another Twitter post from the Fallout Prime Video account. This is the first public video pertaining to the series, which is more of just a teaser of the release date than anything else. An update on Paddington 3, Paddington in Peru, and finally, from one country to another, The Rock’s got some beef with a museum in Paris.

Ex-Special Forces operative Mason Pettits (John Cena) is stuck in a dead-end desk job when he’s reluctantly recruited by former military buddy Sebastian Earle (Christian Slater) to take on a simple freelance gig providing security for washed-up journalist Claire Wellington (Alison Brie).  
He begrudgingly escorts Claire on assignment to interview a ruthless – but impeccably dressed – dictator Juan Venegas (Juan Pablo Raba), when a military coup breaks out just as she’s about to get the scoop of a lifetime. Now, the unlikely trio must figure out how to survive the jungle AND each other in order to make it out alive!

From Pierre Morel the dynamic director of Taken and Peppermint, and written by Jacob Lentz,  Freelance also stars Alice Eve, Martin Csokas, Julianna Arrieta and Sebastian Eslava. 
Freelance is in theaters only October 27.

From the original Call of Duty, to console ports, and Modern Warfare, here's how Call of Duty 1 reinvented the first-person shooter, while honouring games before it, like Medal of Honor.
