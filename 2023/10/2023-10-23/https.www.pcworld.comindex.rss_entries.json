That &ldquo;G&rdquo; slapped next to the number means &ldquo;generation.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not a reference to the download or upload speeds you get on your cell phone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You also may have already seen the advertisements about Comcast&rsquo;s new 10G Xfinity network blanketing the airwaves and other platforms.

The entire Diablo community will benefit from this, as hitting 220 quarts, 440 quarts, and 666 quarts will also unlock various cosmetic items in the Diablo 4 game. Once the blood donation goal has been reached, the competition for the custom gaming PC, which is infused with &ldquo;real human blood&rdquo; to some degree, will start.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-you", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2113816/diablo-iv-blizzard-raffles-off-gaming-pc-with-human-blood-in-the-water-cooling-system.html", "date_published": "2023-10-23T15:00:32+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "PC world", "album": "PC world", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Save $800 on this ridiculously lightweight LG Gram laptop", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re in the market for a featherlight laptop, you&rsquo;ve come to the right place.
