From playing in smaller Americana scenes to being on multiple late-night shows in the past year, Ward\u2019s journey in music has been nothing less than fruitful.\n\nHer latest album, \"Anarchist Gospel,\" explores resiliency and deep reflection, as it\u2019s wrapped up in a bow of lush harmonic music with strong roots in Americana and folk. \n\nCredits\nGuest \u2013 Sunny War\nHost \u2013 Ayisha Jaffer\nProducer \u2013 Derrick Stevens\nVideo Director \u2013 Evan Clark\nAudio \u2013 Micah Kopecky\nGraphics \u2013 Natalia Toledo\nDigital Producers \u2013 Luke Taylor, Nikhil Kumaran\n\nYou rely on The Current to keep you connected to the music you love, and we rely on you to power this station.
