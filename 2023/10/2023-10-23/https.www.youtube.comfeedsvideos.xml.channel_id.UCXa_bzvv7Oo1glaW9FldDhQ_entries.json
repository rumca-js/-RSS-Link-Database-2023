Set one year later, Jack returns as the protagonist to combat a new threat to the Tower. That means more platforming, slashing and Cybervoid-venturing.\n\nWhile Ghostrunner 2 maintains the same killer presentation and pulsating soundtrack, it also layers in new mechanics, like motorcycle sections, Ultimates, revamped progression and new enemies. Each level offers something fresh to tackle while pushing you to the limits of capability (and sanity).\n\nDespite some encounters requiring a bit of retuning, some bugs and iffy dialogues, One More Level's follow-up is a fast-paced, tense experience which almost constantly throws new things and challenges you to come out on top.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjIQPhKo9yA", "date_published": "2023-10-23T15:30:04+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/GjIQPhKo9yA/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Why Alan Wake 2 Will Be One of the Biggest Games of the Year", "description": "Alan Wake 2 is set up to be a survival horror remix of Remedy Entertainment\u2019s favorite atmospheric thriller, promising a complex, interweaving storyline combining the shuffling terror of horror with detective-led gameplay. \n\nNew protagonist Agent Saga Anderson is joining Alan in this new adventure; her real-world investigation into a series of ritualistic murders in Bright Falls contrasting neatly with Alan\u2019s attempts to escape from a shapeshifting Dark Place. \n\nThe one-two punch of flashlight before gunfire returns for this sequel but there\u2019s a wealth of fresh mechanics in this long-awaited follow up too, highlighting Remedy\u2019s ambition to craft their longest, most mind-warping title to date.
