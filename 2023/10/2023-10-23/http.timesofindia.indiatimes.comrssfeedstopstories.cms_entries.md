At the centre of this powerful vortex consuming all in its path is the eye of the storm, Virat Kohli, the calm epicentre, the glue who binds the diverse elements and brazenly attempts to scale both tall run-chases and some stratospheric landmarks which are in his sights.

The city of Thane in Maharashtra, India has seen a significant drop in the number of registrations for new autorickshaws in recent years. Factors such as increasing fuel prices, traffic congestion, and competition from fleet cabs have discouraged people from entering the occupation. In 2022-23, the number of new autorickshaw registrations dropped by 85% compared to five years ago. Female auto driver Anamika Bhalerao stated that rising overhead costs, particularly fuel charges, have made the profession less lucrative. The availability of fleet cabs and improved public transport options have also affected the demand for autorickshaws. Activists and union leaders criticized the state government for not providing sufficient support to the industry.
