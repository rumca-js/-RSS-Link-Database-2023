<p><strong>Royal Opera House, London<br /></strong>Sam Steiner’s play, set in a world of rationed speech, lends itself to movement, and the dancers here also retain the dialogue, fusing the forms with quiet grace</p><p>A story in which a new “hush law” limits every person to 140 spoken words a day is a good idea for a dance adaptation: who would thrive in those circumstances except expert physical communicators? Although in Sam Steiner’s 2015 play Lemons Lemons Lemons Lemons Lemons (here renamed The Limit), nobody thrives under such draconian control. Certainly not the couple in this two-hander, played by Royal Ballet principals Alexander Campbell (whose idea this show was) and Francesca Hayward. Surprisingly, they don’t replace script with dance but act the whole play – remarkably well considering they’re not trained actors – and move at the same time. Hayward is the Royal’s most natural and luminous dance-actress, and her inner light turns out to be a transferable skill. She has cl

She finally has her say in this astute indictment of the system that exploited her</p><p>Over the course of Britney Spears’ career, she was repeatedly subject to narratives constructed to disempower her. She was a teenage pop star presented as a virgin then scolded for a sexualised image sold by those same forces. After her breakup from Justin Timberlake, Spears was vilified and forced to undergo <a href="https://time.com/6326142/britney-spears-diane-sawyer-interview-memoir/">a grilling from Diane Sawyer</a> so severe you might have thought she was a war criminal, not a double denim-wearing singer.</p><p>It made her suspicious of entertainment’s gendered double standard, she writes in her highly anticipated memoir, though that was nothing compared with the legal disfranchisement she later experienced.

<p>This calm, vivid documentary looks at the thousands of youngsters missing amidst the invasion – and their families’ search. Be warned: the Russian response may cause outrage</p><p>These are terrible times, bleak times, and Ukraine’s Stolen Children is one of many films continuing to shed light on the growing list of horrors blighting the world. Veteran journalist and film-maker Shahida Tulaganova tells the horrifying story of the thousands of children reported missing from Ukraine in 2022, who were taken away in the months after Russia invaded the country.</p><p>In March, the international criminal court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Vladimir Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova, the Russian commissioner for children’s rights, for the alleged war crimes of unlawfully deporting and transporting Ukrainian children. In this film, Tulaganova gets to the heart of it, speaking to some of the young people who were taken by the Russians, sometimes to what were supposed to be holiday camps. She

These oppositional colors immediately catch the eye, and then leave a viewer wondering how Sora can so effortlessly situate them alongside each other.</p><p>Colors are one of the many oppositions that Sora elegantly reconciles at her debut New York City show, Vian Sora: End of Hostilities, on view at David Nolan Gallery. The long and winding road that the Baghdad-born, Louisville, Kentucky–based painter has taken throughout her tumultuous life and career sits portentously in these meditative, appealing works that balance abstraction with figuration.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/oct/23/vian-sora-exhibit

Three years on, they are bottom of Ligue 1. Despite their catastrophic current campaign, the decline has been steady but sure. They are an example of how not to run a top-tier modern football club. The 2-1 home defeat on Sunday to Clermont, who were bottom themselves at kick-off, is the latest sign that one of France’s grandest clubs is now under genuine threat of relegation.</p><p>Haphazard transfer business is the most glaring of Lyon’s recent failings. Successful additions since that win over City have been rare. Lucas Paquetá, signed from Milan in September 2020 before moving to West Ham last year, is one of few exceptions

<p>Tom Emmer current frontrunner as candidates due to present themselves in forum on Monday evening</p><p>Good morning, US politics blog readers. It has now been 20 days since the House of Representatives last had a speaker, and the Republican majority is no closer to figuring out who should lead Congress’s lower chamber than they were when <strong>Kevin McCarthy</strong> was booted out of the job by the far-right and Democrats. On Friday, conservative firebrand <strong>Jim Jordan</strong>’s candidacy collapsed after failing to win the speaker’s gavel in three rounds of voting, and we now have nine, yes nine, Republicans running for speaker.</p><p>We will run through all the candidates later, but Minnesota’s <strong>Tom Emmer</strong> is viewed as the frontrunner at this point. He’s the Republican whip, the third-highest-ranking position among the House GOP, and has received McCarthy’s endorsement. But if there’s one thing Republicans have proven over the past three weeks, it’s that

<p>Returning stars will boost Arsenal, woes continue for Everton and Aston Villa but Manchester City rise to the top</p><p>Guess who’s back, back again, Viv is back, tell a friend. Yes, Arsenal’s Vivianne Miedema is back in action. The striker played her first minutes since rupturing her ACL last December in the Gunners’ 2-1 win against a stoic Bristol City on Sunday. Miedema was named on the bench and came on, ironically, in injury time. The Dutch star has not lost any of her shine either as she threaded a pinpoint pass to Beth Mead who almost scored. “It was a really special moment for Viv, she’s worked so hard over the last few months,” said Katie McCabe, who scored both of Arsenal goals. “I said to her at the end I thought it was going to be a trademark Viv special because she slotted Beth in and I thought Beth was going to finish it off and it was going to be written in the stars. I’m sure we’ll see that combination coming up in the next few weeks.” <strong>Sarah Rendell</strong

<p>Nate Ki’s shocking debut feature follows a man who revisits the grim flat where he grew up, which remains haunted with extravagant evil</p><p>This very creepy horror movie is the feature debut for director Nate Ki, who demonstrates both a talent for suggesting rather than spelling out backstory as well as an unabashed streak of cruelty. Where most film-makers would hold back a bit and refrain from traumatising the audience with images of child abuse, suicide, self-mutilation and rape, Ki jumps right in. At least the editing doesn’t linger too long on the worst of it, but there’s still plenty to disturb the viewer with a film that seems to draw as much on the horror traditions of Cantonese cinema as well as western film-makers. For instance, the use of space evokes David Lynch in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/oct/24/david-lynch-bill-pullman-patricia-arquette-dominatrix-lost-highway">Lost Highway</a> mode, while the community full of secrets and evil trope brings

<p>A collection of the New Yorker editor’s pieces on the likes of Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney and Aretha Franklin displays enviable knowledge and scope</p><p>How to critique a compendium of writings on music by the Pulitzer prize-winning editor of <em>the New Yorker</em>? Praise would read like a job application. A hatchet job would be absurdly polemical. In a 2016 piece on the late, great Leonard Cohen, David Remnick quotes a conversation between Cohen and Bob Dylan in which the two singer-songwriters discussed accomplishment. Cohen, Dylan said, was “number one” but Dylan was “number zero”.</p><p>Remnick’s stuff is noisomely good. Rightly or wrongly, <em>the New Yorker</em> is often held to be the loftiest spot left in print, where the business of stringing sentences together on interesting topics still exists in an exalted form, insulated from the closures, compromises and clickbait that prevails elsewhere.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/oct/23/holding-the-note-w

<p>A tiresome film about an immortal villain who kidnaps a maiden, which treats its plucky heroine poorly and the viewer even worse</p><p>I’m not sure how desperate a day with the kids would need to get to make this animated adventure from Russia an appealing option. It’s possible that standing in a 76-minute downpour would be more fun (and cheaper). Or being locked in a broom cupboard with a toddler tantrumming about the wrong colour icing on a cupcake. This is a family movie that is spectacularly boring, animated on the cheap, and dubbed into English by bored-sounding actors.</p><p>The story revolves around Drybone, a man who long ago became immortal. He’s meant to be a fiend but speaks like an apathetic IT helpdesk engineer at five-minutes-to-clock-off. For centuries, Drybone has been searching for a bride, assisted by his two bat sidekicks, Bram and Stoker. (Minor irritation: the film looks like it’s set in the middle ages; Bram Stoker died in 1912.) Anyway, in a nearby town a pl

<p>These nine feminist essays about female celebrities of the 00s expose the casual sexism of the era and the way it shaped ordinary women’s lives</p><p>Britney, Paris, Kim. Poor Jen, messy Lindsay, talented yet tragic Amy. If you were an even vaguely young woman in the 00s, these celebrities’ first names alone probably conjure memories. They were our cultural wallpaper, female icons made and too often broken by mass media, in whom we hunted “for clues about what a woman ought to be”, as the journalist Sarah Ditum writes. Sexy, but not too sexy; empowered, but still unthreatening.</p><p>Ditum’s hotly anticipated book brilliantly captures the prevailing millennial mood of anti-nostalgia, or looking back through newly appalled eyes on the past – in this case an era of prurient, tech-enabled misogyny she christens the “Upskirt Decade”, elastically located between 1998 and 2013. “I lived through the noughties. I read the blogs. I laughed at the jokes,” she writes. “And yet, in writing th

<p>Jill Wright’s actor son Harry told her she would love working in the theatre. After she lost him, she discovered how right he had been</p><p>Jill Wright’s son, Harry, had song and dance in his bones. At 18 months old, he was dancing like the Spice Girls, copying the choreography from the TV. At seven, he won a talent contest and, at 16, a scholarship to the Urdang academy of performing arts in London. At 23, he was performing in The Book of Mormon in the West End when he was diagnosed with a brain tumour. Two years later, in 2019, Harry died. His death, and her grief, upturned Wright’s life.</p><p>This year, at 61, she staged a show written by Harry, at St Paul’s church, Covent Garden (commonly known as <a href="https://actorschurch.org/" title="">the Actors’ church</a>), in his memory. After working for 40 years in the NHS, most recently as a speech and language therapist for children with special needs, she has switched careers to become a dresser for Les Misérables. “It was bec

<p>Intended as an issue drama that also addresses intergenerational tensions, this film doesn’t manage to dig far beneath the surface</p><p>Grappling with the growing pains of an Asian-Canadian teenager, Jason Karman’s well-intentioned debut aims to tackle a multitude of big themes – but it also makes a mistake that plagues other issue-driven films where the characters take the backseat to the talking points. Split between a queer coming-of-age narrative and a portrait of intergenerational differences, Golden Delicious ends up treating both subjects with insufficient depth.</p><p>A capable performer who looks well into his late 20s, Cardi Wong plays 17-year-old protagonist Jake, a born people-pleaser who does his best to make his unyielding father George (Ryan Mah) and his bubbly girlfriend Valerie (Parmiss Sehat) happy. Such efforts are usually to Jake’s own detriment. To continue George’s broken dreams of athletic prowess, Jake dutifully practises basketball every day, even though

Our options aren’t the best. We’ve been offered a two-year fixed-rate deal at 5.64% with a product fee of £1,249. If the fee is added to the loan, the monthly repayment is £1,837, or £1,830 if it’s not. The alternative is a five-year fixed-rate deal with an interest rate of 5.23% and product fee of £1,249. If the product fee is added to the loan, the monthly repayment is £1,745 and £1,739 if it’s not.</p><p>My question is would it be better to remortgage with the two-year fixed-rate and hope interest rates are lower when we come to remortgage again or go for the five-year deal which works out less a month at the moment but for a longer period of time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/oct/23/should-we-take-a-two-year-fixed-mortgage-or-a-cheaper-five-year-deal">Continue reading

His features are unidentifiable and his body is frail as he struggles to support himself on impossibly spindly legs, visible through his trousers. It’s an image of hardship, heightened by the four infants who stand around him, waiting. They look stoic, yet you can sense their vulnerability. What does he have to give?</p><p>I saw this installation – called Untitled (Possil, At Last) – at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge last week.

<p>Homosexuality was decriminalised in 2018 but the supreme court has declined to change marriage laws</p><p>Utkarsh Saxena had been secretly planning the proposal for weeks. He had secretly measured his boyfriend’s finger while he was sleeping and bought a pair of matching steel rings from a Delhi market. They had been together for 15 years, having fallen in love on the university debating team, and Saxena felt optimistic that this would be an auspicious moment to ask the love of his life to marry him – the same day that India’s supreme court ruled on whether same-sex couples would be allowed to get married.</p><p>Yet when the verdict came out on Tuesday, Saxena’s heart broke. Even as India’s chief justice, DY Chandrachud, spoke of India’s long history of LGBTQ+ people and their right to equality, he ruled that changing marriage laws was beyond the scope of the court and that marriage was not a fundamental right. It was the job of parliament, not judges, to make such decisions, Chan

<p>Certain dates are seared into the minds of those who have tried to untangle the decades-long Israel-Palestine conflict, be it 1917, 1947, 1967, 1973 – and now 2023. Chris McGreal reports on an escalating war that is only understandable by looking to the past</p><p>Everything about the roots of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is contested, from the events themselves to how far back in history to find a starting point. Some begin with the Romans. Others the late 19th-century Jewish migration to what was then the Ottoman empire and the rise of Zionism.</p><p>But the start for many is the UN’s vote in 1947 to partition land in the British mandate of Palestine into two states – one Jewish, one Arab – after the destruction of much of European Jewry in the Holocaust.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/oct/23/how-a-contested-history-feeds-the-israel-palestine-conflict-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
