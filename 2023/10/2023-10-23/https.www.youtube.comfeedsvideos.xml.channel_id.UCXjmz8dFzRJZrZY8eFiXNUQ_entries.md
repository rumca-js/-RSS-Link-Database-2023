When it was first announced that the sequel to How I Met Your Mother was coming to Hulu, many fans weren't sure how to take How I Met Your Father.   Would How I Met Your Father come anywhere close to living up to the standard set by How I Met Your Mother?  Or would this new Hilary Duff driven sitcom fall short like the previous attempt.  Well, after 2 short seasons, it seems fans got their answer when How I Met Your Father was abruptly cancelled before getting a third season.
