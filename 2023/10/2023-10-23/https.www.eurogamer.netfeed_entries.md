If you've somehow missed out on developer Dennaton Games' classic Hotline Miami series - or are just looking for another excuse to revisit its woozily eccentric mayhem - you might like to know both games are now natively available for Xbox Series X/S and PS5.
</p><p>
It has, somewhat unbelievably, been over a decade since Hotline Miami first dropped jaws and quickened pulses with its breathless, blood-soaked top-down ode to violence, in which the game's unnamed protagonist rampages against the local Miami mafia after receiving cryptic instructions on his answering machine.
</p><p>
Its grisly blend of stealth and ultra-gory shooting action - paired with a surreal narrative, a stylish fever-dream aesthetic, and an absolute stunner of a pulsing synth soundtrack - immediately won it fans (Eurogamer awarded it 10/10 at the ti

Microsoft's occasional Xbox Partner Preview series returns this Wednesday, 25th October, with another digital showcase.
</p><p>
As usual, the Xbox Partner Preview will focus exclusively on third-party offerings - ranging from indie games to "familiar favourites", as per Microsoft's <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/10/23/xbox-partner-preview-announce/">announcement</a> - with proceedings set to begin this Wednesday at 6pm BST/1pm ET.
</p><p>
As to what will be shown, Microsoft has already confirmed appearances from Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio's Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, Studio Wildcard's Ark: Survival Ascended (which will be airing first gameplay), Remedy Entertainment's Alan Wake 2 (expect a "launch trailer for this one), and a fresh look at Dungeons of Hinterberg.

The developers of the latest King Kong game say they were given just one year to build the game from scratch, with the harsh timeline mandated by publisher GameMill Entertainment.
</p><p>
Last week, Skull Island: Rise of Kong released on PC, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch and Xbox with little marketing fanfare, but garnered attention for its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-king-kong-game-is-a-swing-and-a-miss-with-the-internet">poor quality</a>, especially for a game for a licensed franchise.
</p><p>
In a new report from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/20/23925326/skull-island-rise-of-kong-development-gamemill-entertainment">The Verge</a>, developers from IguanaBee say the game was made in one year from scratch and with very little funding.

Stand by, Fallout fans - there's only a few months left for you to stay in your bunkers before the Amazon Prime Fallout TV series debuts in April next year. 
</p><p>
A brief teaser video posted to X, formerly Twitter, reveals the Fallout series release date: 12th April 2024.
</p><p>
(Of course, this date is written in the American style, so 4/12/24. But good news, it isn't debuting next December.)

Yes, you guessed it - Thomas the Tank Engine.</p><p>Modder <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/alienisolation/mods/48">Matt Filer</a> has given us exactly that, with a new mod he released earlier today. This also marks the first mod which swaps the Xenomorph out for something else, Filer says, which is quite surprising. Alien: Isolation seems like the perfect fodder for this kind of thing, but a quick scan on Nexus Mods shows indeed, there aren't any mods which do this already.</p><p>Filer has put a short but sweet paragraph into the mod's description: "This mod swaps the Xenomorph for Thomas the Tank Engine.

## Spider-Man 2 creative director labels it as Insomniac's version of MCU's Civil War

When asked about a possible third Spider-Man game, Spider-Man 2's creative director Bryan Intihar likened the sequel to the MCU's Captain America: Civil War.
</p><p>
Speaking on Skill Up's Friends Per Second podcast, conversation with the developer turned to a "hypothetical" third main game in Insomniac's Spider-Man series. Inthar was understandably quiet for a good while, clearly not wanting to give too much of the studio's plans for the series away. 
</p><p>
However, after some careful deliberation, the developer said whatever <em>could</em> happen next would undoubtedly be "pretty epic".

Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth has taken less than four years to develop thanks to team chemistry.
</p><p>
Between 80-90 percent of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake development team have continued their work on Rebirth, allowing for efficient development, its director has said.
</p><p>
"It was quite clear who to go to if we had a certain question or problem we were trying to solve," director Naoki Hamaguchi told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-20/-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-director-started-out-as-a-fan">Bloomberg</a>. "We were able to work together as a team, achieve this great flow and tempo of game development."

## Spider-Man 2 developer promises fix for Cuban flag in Miles' home

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> developer Insomniac Games has said it will replace a Cuban flag in Miles Morales' home with the correct Puerto Rican design.
</p><p>
Following the game's release last week, fans have been poring over its details. One such detail was the inclusion of a Cuban flag in Miles' house, as well as various Cuban flags in the surrounding area. However, Miles is not from Cuba. His mother, Rio Morales, is Puerto Rican, and while both flags are similar, the colours are different.
</p><p>
Many noticed this slip-up. Over the weekend, reddit user TheHouselessTurtle shared a screenshot from the game showing the Cuban flag inside Miles' home.

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> is a big success for PlayStation, with enormous opening weekend sales of physical copies here in the UK.
</p><p>
Insomniac's sequel is the fourth-biggest UK boxed game launch of 2023, behind EA Sports FC, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Hogwarts Legacy.
</p><p>
All of this means Nintendo Switch exclusive Super Mario Bros. Wonder had to contend for second place this week, though Nintendo games tend to sell more consistently over the weeks that follow.

A new update has been launched for Lords of the Fallen that alters its New Game Plus mode, as well as enemy density and performance.
</p><p>
The patch notes, available on Steam, detail the post-game changes which will now no longer remove all vestiges (checkpoints). Instead, each iteration of New Game Plus will remove more vestiges until NG+3 when all will be removed for the biggest challenge.
</p><p>
In addition, players will have the option to continue their current game retaining character, items and progression but resetting the world to allow completionists to finish outstanding tasks. A customisable NG+ modifier system is also on the way so players can tweak the experience themselves.
