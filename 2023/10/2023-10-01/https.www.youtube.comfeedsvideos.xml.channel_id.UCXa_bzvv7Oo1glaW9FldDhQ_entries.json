As with much of Kojima\u2019s output, this is a story open to interpretation, but this feature argues that MGSV has a sense of incompleteness because it\u2019s one point in a circular story. Most notably, the endless cycle of war as portrayed in Venom\u2019s choice to carry on Big Boss\u2019s legacy support this notion, but there are other thematic elements discussed in the feature too.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n46Qp6rSvm4", "date_published": "2023-10-01T09:30:13+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/n46Qp6rSvm4/hqdefault.jpg"}]
