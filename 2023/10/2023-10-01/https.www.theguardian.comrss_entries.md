Yes, that was good advice, but possibly not so good given that the rip current was so wide I couldn’t actually see either side.</p><p>I suppose I could have taken a shot at it Olympic-swimmer style, but I reasoned that by the time I made it to the side, if I made it at all, I’d be halfway to Sydney, so what was the point?

<p>A French peasant with an insatiable appetite lives through revolutionary chaos in a vivid, beautifully written historical novel</p><p>It is a truism of creative writing classes that hunger of one kind or another is a prerequisite for the protagonist in any drama.

As with her previous novel, it is inspired by a historical figure – in this case, the Great Tarare, a French peasant who lived at the end of the 18th century and became a freakshow attraction on account of his prodigious appetite (he is said to have eaten improbable quantities of food as well as household objects, live animals and a toddler).</p><p>In Blakemore’s reinvention, Tarare’s short life spans th

<p><strong>Hackney Empire, London</strong><br />Monteverdi’s opera about unfettered desire is pulled into the present day in Robin Norton-Hale’s stylised production with fine singing and solid musical support from Yshani Perinpanayagam</p><p>Robin Norton-Hale’s new staging of The Coronation of Poppea for English Touring Opera is her first production for the company since her appointment as general director last year. It’s a striking if uneven piece of theatre. She can be insightful in her approach to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/claudio-monteverdi">Monteverdi</a>’s examination of unfettered desire, and she retains the metaphysical overlay that some directors play down. She is less successful, perhaps, when it comes to the opera’s politics. And there are musical inequalities as well.</p><p>Norton-Hale pulls the work forward into a stylised present. Rome, designed by Basia Bińkowska, is a place of geometric shapes and abstractions, vaguely suggestive of Italian futurism.

<p><strong>National Gallery, London</strong><br />Often overshadowed by his contemporary Rembrandt, the 17th-century Haarlem artist is revealed to be a genius of the seemingly nonchalant yet telling portrait in this first showcase of his work in 30 years</p><p>Two portraits: Marie Larp and Pieter Dircksz Tjarck, painted as a pendant pair by Frans Hals in about 1635, a year after their marriage. And what a couple they make. Pieter Tjarck holds a pink rose – a symbol, perhaps, of his love for his new wife. But it fairly flops from his fingers, less a prop than an afterthought. It’s his face that’s the main attraction: carefully considering eyes, outstandingly bristly moustache, that long, well-earned groove between his eyebrows. Tipped back in his seat, as if ready to answer any question, his unstudied aspect makes Marie Larp seem almost impossibly formal beside him, her back straight, her embroidered dress without any crease or fold. Look a little harder, though. The scarlet of her ch

<p>These stories of ex-offenders who returned to prison are varied and affecting, but the writer’s sometimes simple solutions to a complex issue can make him sound complacent</p><p>Life inside our prisons is gloomy, violent and humiliating. So why do around half of those who leave prison go back within a year? In his latest book, film-maker and former inmate Chris Atkins explains how our chaotic and inhumane system helps to create this bleak statistic. We meet Steve, who started using drugs to escape the trauma of being sexually abused as a child. When he is sent to prison, drugs are everywhere on the landing. Between 2015 and 2020 the proportion of people who developed a substance problem while in custody more than doubled. What chance does Steve have of rehabilitation?</p><p>In many incarceration stories, redemption comes through an individual who beats the institution against the odds.

It’s a no-stakes romcom that’s all filler (a diversion to a Gypsy encampment, a dream scene) and yet there’s something so winning about it: the sheer sunniness, the fun and energy of the large ensemble (even with some lame buffoonery) and the showcase it offers for dazzling technique, especially in the shape of the opening night’s superlative leads, Marianela Nuñez and Vadim Muntagirov.</p><p>This is Carlos Acosta’s revised production from 2013, and it is a huge challenge of stamina across three acts for its prime couple playing the young lovers, Kitri and Basilio (Don

<p>The Chilean author’s assured fictionalised portrait of the visionary Hungarian scientist who contributed to the Manhattan Project and laid the foundations of modern computing is darkly intelligent and feverishly propulsive</p><p>Early on in this darkly fascinating novel based on real people and events, the Austrian physicist Paul Ehrenfest speaks of a “strange new rationality” that’s taking shape as the old certainties of classical physics crumble around him. He describes it as “a spectre haunting the soul of science… both logic-driven and utterly irrational… preparing to thrust itself into our lives through technology by enrapturing the cleverest men and women with whispered promises of superhuman power and godlike control”.</p><p>Ehrenfest is speaking from the depths of a breakdown but his warning sets the tone for the rest of Benjamín Labatut’s book, which explores how these clever men and women (though mostly men) set about unleashing that spectre with dazzling and devastating

It would continue with the walk from the bus stop to the hotel where we’ve arranged to meet, during which I see a writer almost as famous as he is, whose purchase of some little dental brushes in a nearby chemist brings me to consider the rather levelling fact that even great novelists suffer from gum disease. Finally, it would relate my deep anxiety, once inside the hotel, on seeing that the table right next to ours is occupied by a coupl

Say goodbye to summer with glorious dishes of cauliflower and late berries<p>There is always much stretching to reach the high-grown berries, the arching branches whose fruits have been caught by the early autumn sun. The price you pay is being scratched by the brambles’ thorns that not only tear at your skin but refuse to let go. You arrive home, tiny beads of blood on your arms and legs, but with a bag of tart berries to add to an apple pie – perhaps the most nostalgia-inducing recipe of all time – or to add to the roasting juices of a pork loin, baked field mushrooms the size of side plates, or to pickle with red wine vinegar and peppercorns.</p><p>This autumn I used my berry haul for overnight oats, adding them to the soaked cereal, cinnamon and apple juice the following morning, along with yoghurt and a coarsely grated sharp apple. The berries also make a glossy, softly textured jam. I put a few spoonfuls of last year’s batch to use as the topping for a baked berry pudding – lik

<p>Very odd but intensely moreish confectionery</p><p>As the summer ended, I had guests round and decided to make eclairs with white chocolate cream. However, for reasons that are too lengthy to go into here, but involved a broken whisk and remaking the mixture with a less powerful one, I ended up making eclairs in my Yorkshire pudding tins and hence they became Yorkshire eclairs. But that’s not really the point, the point is that this time I used <strong>Simon Rogan</strong>’s <a href="https://www.simonrogan.co.uk/shop/product/simon-rogan-caramelised-white-chocolate" title="">Caramelised White Chocolate</a> (£6.95, 250g) for the cream. This is the strangest white chocolate I’ve seen, big chunks of it with a crumbly interior. It almost tasted like Scottish tablet: intensely sweet, but insanely moreish. Melting it took ages, but the result was this wonderful butterscotch-coloured cream sat upon my new creation of a Yorkshire eclair. Rogan recommends melting it into cream and setting i

My new series explores the history of the union of the nations that make up the UK but, more than 18 months after I started work on the project, I feel only marginally less conflicted than I did at the beginning about the history of the union, and its future.</p><p>It was my own conflicted sense of identity that first made me want to make the new series, because I – like millions of people – don’t have to dig very deep or ask myself too many

There was no running hot water, no indoor toilet, no central heating. For a long time he shared a bed with his brother, Trevor, who was five years his senior. Many local families were similarly impoverished. One of Stewart’s friends wore wellington boots to school, without socks, no matter the season – there was no alternative. For entertainment, he turned to one of four books his family owned: an ancient encyclopedia passed down by his grandfather, a couple of war volumes belonging to his father, and a large but tattered dictionary. “That was until I found the library,” he says, “which was critical.” He goes on, “Other than the radio, our

Her husband, Sidney, was out of a job, her daughter needed a bridesmaid’s outfit, Christmas was coming. Jobs were scarce, a Labour government had cut benefits and instigated wage restraint. Neighbours viewed those on the dole as “scroungers”. Jackson wanted to look after her family and save face. She needed money. In 1976, she was stabbed

But in 1973, when 20-year-old Nir Atir was stationed in the southern Golan, the view was very different.

<p>The renowned fashion photographer creates a mood of ‘haunted neoclassicism’ in this image shot near Paris in the 80s</p><p>Deborah Turbeville’s photographs first appeared in <em>Vogue</em> in 1975, when she was already 42. Her singular, intimate style – her models, it was noted, always seemed “locked in their solitude”, oblivious to the camera – was subsequently a fixture in fashion magazines until her death in 2013. This image from 1985 features the models Anh Duong and Marie-Sophie wearing the clothes of Emanuel Ungaro, but that doesn’t explain the half of it. Turbeville, characteristically, appears to have chanced upon a scene of impossibly dusty decadence. Her two otherworldly figures are set in dreamlike relation to each other. Marie-Sophie sits staring into the past like a nude by Ingres, while Duong faces glassily forward, apparently contemplating visions, her arm hanging over the edge of the shrouded chaise, in limp homage to Jacques Louis-David’s <em>The Death of Marat</e

<p>Using recycled materials and even metal left behind by Israeli rockets, artists continue to endure in the tiny coastal enclave</p><p>Grey rubble dust has settled on almost everything around a destroyed house in Deir al-Balah, a town in the centre of the occupied Gaza Strip, but on some shrapnel-pocked walls, the paint is still fresh and vibrant.</p><p>Graffiti artists have used the building as a canvas after Israel’s five-day Operation Shield and Arrow in May, a surprise offensive that left 33 Palestinians and two people in Israel dead. On one wall, a child waving a Palestinian flag is depicted with wings, standing amid the clouds. In a destroyed bedroom, a young girl brushing her hair has been painted behind a ruined dressing table, her face peering out from where the mirror used to be.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/01/artists-working-siege-gaza-israel">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Amid anger over sewage and waste, the UK industry’s five-year business plans will be closely watched this week</p><p>Keen swimmers passing St Mary’s Bay in Kent could be forgiven for being tempted by a late September dip in its glistening waters. They would be wise to think twice, however. The beauty spot has earned the dubious honour of being named Britain’s most polluted beach, and in February the Environment Agency warned against swimming there for a year due to high levels of faecal matter. St Mary’s is now an emblem for a sewage-spewing water industry which has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/30/water-company-fines-england-used-for-environmental-improvements" title="">repeatedly fined</a> and justifiably vilified.</p><p>Against this backdrop, England and Wales’s 16 water suppliers will submit their business plans on Monday to the regulator, Ofwat, to cover 2025-30, or “asset management period 8” (AMP8).

<p>This five-part docuseries about one of the greatest rappers of all time’s relationship with his radical mother is a meticulous, emotional watch. It’s so detailed it demands multiple sittings</p><p>Music documentaries tend to follow certain beats – upbringing; career beginnings; meteoric rise; inevitable fall. The director Allen Hughes is smart enough not to draw entirely outside these lines with Dear Mama: The Saga of Afeni and Tupac Shakur – his five-part docuseries about Tupac, one of the most famous and influential rappers of all time, and his Black Panther mother. The series moves at a snappy pace, and is told chronologically, while intercutting between Tupac’s youth and Afeni’s. At the same time, it is far more thorough and far more sweeping than many other music documentaries, and especially those about stars as culturally significant as Tupac. Hughes sows his seeds carefully, telling a story of Black oppression and liberation, complex and occasionally fraught familial bonds

<p>The stars try to save a familiar slab of sci-fi pondering involving a robotic replacement for a husband, but it’s not enough</p><p>In the year 2065, water and fertile land are precious resources. The US midwest, ravaged by heat and drought, is sparsely populated and barren. Also, new technology allows AI to create sentient, indistinguishable copies of humans.</p><p>Such are the opening facts, delivered in title cards, of Foe, starring Paul Mescal and Saoirse Ronan as a married couple conscripted into an off-planet settlement program. The concept sounds like a lesser Black Mirror episode and, indeed, the film never escapes the long shadow of the hit-and-miss UK television series, which triggered a wave of underbaked, easily forgotten sci-fi.
