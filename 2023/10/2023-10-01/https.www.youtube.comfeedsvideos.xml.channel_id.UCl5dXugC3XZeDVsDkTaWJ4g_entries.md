For more than a week, I stayed in Otluk, a village in the Afyonkarahisar province of Turkey. Earlier, I had experienced a Turkish village in 2018 in a different province.  The reason I could reach Otluk was my friend Gokhan, who, after hosting me, has now started to host other tourists.

How to Contact Gökhan - (local contact in Pamukkale & Otluk Afyonkarahisar)
