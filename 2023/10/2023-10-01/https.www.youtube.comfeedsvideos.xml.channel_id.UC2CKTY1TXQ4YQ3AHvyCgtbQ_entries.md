Giant robots was how I got into miniature wargaming (back in middle school - a long time ago) and I'm getting settled back in now, in 2023. I'll tell you more about that and where I'm going with it, and of course, I'll answer your wargaming-related questions. Come have fun!

Vince Venturella and I made another game! Check out MAJESTIC 13 at http://www.majestic13game.com

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
