Blue Beetle is the beginning of the new James Gunn phase of the DCEU... or not... nobody really knows, least of all DC. It's a movie that has good components, but sadly was ruined by poor execution. And as a result nobody cared: Blue Beetle was a big flop and only made around a 100 million dollars at the box office. It's one of the biggest superhero movie flops of all time. So, in today's episode of Anatomy of a Failure, let's try to find out why. Here's why Blue Beetle failed despite having better components than most DC movies recently.
