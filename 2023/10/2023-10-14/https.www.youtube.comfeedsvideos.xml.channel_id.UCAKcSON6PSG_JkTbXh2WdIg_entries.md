Nickel Creek — the string band comprising Sara Watkins, Sean Watkins and Chris Thile — have been delighting audiences since they were in their teens, but with long-running and wide-ranging music careers, they hadn’t released an original album together since 2014.That changed during the pandemic, when they suddenly got that spark to work together again. The resulting album is "Celebrants," released on March 23 of this year.

From a session recorded live in The Current studio, watch Nickel Creek performing the song "Where The Long Line Leads" off the new album.
