Angola is a country where very few dare to go. Over the past few videos we've been visiting the varios African tribes in the area. Now, we have a different adventure. But how do you find "off the beaten path" adventures anyway? You'll see a bit behind the scenes as we learn how to loot ships with Angolan ShipWreckers.
