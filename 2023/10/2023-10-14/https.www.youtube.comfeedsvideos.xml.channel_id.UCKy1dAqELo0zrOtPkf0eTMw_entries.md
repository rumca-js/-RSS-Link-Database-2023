Sonic Superstars reviewed by Jada Griffin on PlayStation 5, also available on Xbox, PC, and Switch.

The decision to focus more on exploration is a great idea on paper and creates a unique dynamic to each level, but it sacrifices speed in exchange. The boss designs are creative and clever, but often wear out their welcome with long periods of being untargetable and occasionally frustrating one-hit KO mechanics. Like digging Emeralds out of the rough, Sonic Superstars’ new ideas end up feeling like a mix of both interesting and ill-advised, making it an amusing Sonic game but not exactly a Super one.
