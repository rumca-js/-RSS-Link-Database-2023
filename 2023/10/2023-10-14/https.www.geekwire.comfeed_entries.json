One of the ventures at the forefront of this quest is Sanctuary AI. It&#8217;s a Vancouver, B.C.-based company that has raised more than $100 million Canadian dollars to pursue its vision for labor as a service. Sanctuary makes a 5-foot, 7-inch general-purpose humanoid robot called Phoenix, powered by an AI system called Carbon. &#8220;The economic opportunity here, in terms of being able to both provide&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2023/robots-ai-and-the-future-of-labor-an-economic-opportunity-way-bigger-than-the-steam-engine/\">Read More</a>", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2023/robots-ai-and-the-future-of-labor-an-economic-opportunity-way-bigger-than-the-steam-engine/", "date_published": "2023-10-14T15:03:20+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GeekWire", "album": "GeekWire", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://www.geekwire.com/wp-content/themes/geekwire/dist/images/geekwire-logo-rss.png"}, {"source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed/", "title": "Amazon partners with Petco in latest expansion of return drop-off footprint", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"945\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_9449-1260x945.jpeg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />Amazon is teaming up with another retail competitor to offer customers more places to return products. The Seattle retailer confirmed that it recently began testing a partnership with pet giant Petco, which will accept returns from customers who purchased items on Amazon.com. Amazon did something similar in 2017 when it started accepting returns at Kohl\u2019s stores.
