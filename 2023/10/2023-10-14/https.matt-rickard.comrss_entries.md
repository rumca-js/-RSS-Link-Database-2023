Wikipedia's top five accounts (by number of edits) are all bots. There’s MalnadachBot (11 million edits), WP 1.0 bot(10 million), Cydebot (6.8 million), ClueBot NG (6.3 million), and AnomieBOT (5.9 million.). These bots range in functionality from migrating tables, formats, and markup as Wikipedia changes to automatically detecting and reverting vandalism. Others tag content with labels, archive old discussions, recommend edits, or create new content. The website couldn’t function without them.
