Bulgarian rose oil is the most valuable rose oil on the market. Buyers are willing to pay $15,000 for a single kilogram. But to make the highest-quality Bulgarian rose oil, producers must spend the year cultivating fields that will only bloom for a few weeks. The petals are distilled the same hour they're harvested, costing producers $8,000 a kilo for labor alone.
