<p>The world’s No 1 side have done virtually everything right but in this quarter-final’s intangible moments, New Zealand prevailed</p><p>But if not now, when? Rivers of green trickle out of the stadium, back to the Paris RER and the metro, the night stiff and chilly, the air thick with questions that will never be answered. There is anger, but only a little, and there is sadness, but only a little. Rather, the overwhelming sensation in these earliest twitches of aftermath is a kind of bewilderment, the yawning void where a World Cup semi-final was supposed to be. As if it all feels too abrupt. As if somewhere, on some plane, a sacred pact has been reneged on.</p><p>If not now, when? Perhaps this is the question that will consume Caelan Doris in his quieter moments, as he sees the high ball going up with 72 minutes on the clock, a catch he could make in his sleep that will now keep him awake. Perhaps this is the question that Johnny Sexton will ponder when he revisits the penalty kic

England had struggled in the first half of Friday night’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/13/england-australia-international-friendly-match-report" title="">Wembley friendly against Australia</a>, who were compact, especially in central areas; a threat on the break, set pieces too – exactly the type of opposition that they have laboured to unlock over the years. Gareth Southgate’s experimental team was clogged up, lacking in pace and movement.</p><p>Alexander-Arnold’s first action of the second half was to thread an excellent low pass up in between the lines to Conor Gallagher, which led to a half-chance for James Maddison.

<p>Former chairman who worked to transform the community and club worries owners now lack a sense of the game’s place</p><p>When Sir Bob Murray, who made his fortune in kitchens and bathrooms, became chairman of Sunderland in 1986, he replaced Tom Cowie, who owned a car dealership. For the five years that followed he was involved in a legal dispute over the acquisition of Cowie’s shares with another board member, Barry Batey, a local estate agent. They may at times have been bitterly opposed, but all three men were Sunderland fans. That’s how football used to be.</p><p>By the time Murray sold up 20 years later, to the Niall Quinn-fronted Irish consortium Drumaville, Roman Abramovich was installed at Chelsea and the era of oligarchs, states and private equity was under way.

<p>Tom Hicks’s <em><a href="https://www.blackcountrytype.com/about">Black Country Type</a></em> series began in 2017, when he started photographing striking sights while out cycling in the West Midlands. Since then, the artist, writer and curator has taken hundreds of photographs of brightly coloured buildings and unusual signs, now collected in a book. “It’s a free-form exploration of a region that people don’t know much about,” he says. One of the trickiest aspects of the project is his self-imposed rule about using the sun as natural lighting. “If the sun’s out, I get my bike out. For me, the sunshine lights up the buildings: it illuminates all the textures, revealing things you wouldn’t see on a gloomy day.”</p><ul><li><em><a href="https://the-modernist.org/products/black-country-type">Black Country Type </a></em><a href="https://the-modernist.org/products/black-country-type">is published by The Modernist (£35)</a></li></ul> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/galle

<p>Inspired by the Springboks’ home triumph in 1995, the France coach aims to spark a sense of World Cup destiny in his players</p><p>This week a small flotilla of police boats made its way up the Seine, each one carrying about a dozen players and staff from the French rugby team. The boats moored outside the cathedral of Notre Dame, its occupants put on protective suits and boots, and for the next hour they toured a building that has been closed to the public since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/16/notre-dame-cathedral-fire-a-visual-guide-and-timeline" title="">the devastating fire</a> that almost destroyed it in 2019.

<p>Breaking off both ends of a baguette and buttering and eating them is actually the best thing about being an adult</p><p>In Paris, a kerfuffle. Late last month, under pressure from the health ministry, <a href="https://www.connexionfrance.com/article/Mag/Food-and-Drink/How-baguettes-are-changing-recipe-again-in-France" title="">the salt content</a> in the city’s baguettes was cut from 1.5g per 100g of bread to 1.4g. It seems that the morning baguette currently accounts for 18% of the average French adult’s salt intake of 7.7g a day, which is somewhat distant from the World Health Organization’s recommended 5g, and so – <em>zut, alors! – </em>things had to change. Needless to say, some people are unhappy about this. Bakers, who have already cut the salt content of their baguettes (by 20% since 2015), believe the taste of the bread may suffer, and so do some customers. The word “insipid” has been uttered.</p><p>I love it. French tiffs about food are so much more chic than British on

I was at a friend’s house in the west of the city. We had just finished lunch and made coffee when my phone began to ring relentlessly with a Maltese number that I did not recognise.

<p>Do Jerry Seinfeld’s hints of a return for the sitcom promise a glorious comeback for an all-time TV great? Or a nostalgia-chasing exercise no one needs? Guardian readers have their say</p><p>It wouldn’t be a chuckle-worthy episode without some angst and misanthropy from George. I picture him living a charmed but still-unsatisfied life with an older divorced woman (glomming on to her because of her rent controlled apartment) whose young adult children George is always butting against as he navigates their seemingly “woke” world. Kramer successfully patents an invention no one knew they needed and becomes a millionaire living in Florida who comes to New York for business. Elaine and Jerry together? No. That would disrupt the dynamic. Both have to have been divorced from previous partners, hanging out together while trying to make sense of online dating and trading the same barbs. It’s hard to imagine the core foursome with outside partners or kids: the two worlds colliding. <strong>

<p>Steve Borthwick’s men slipped into bad habits against Samoa and Fiji will be dangerous if the game breaks up</p><p>If England lose to Fiji and find themselves on a plane home next week they will never forgive themselves. That is no disrespect to Fiji but they have such an opportunity to reach a World Cup semi-final which they cannot afford to pass up.</p><p>To be in England at the moment, the noise and the buzz around the match doesn’t feel like a World Cup quarter-final but the players have done what they’ve needed to do. They’ve won all their games and dropped only two points along the way. Victory against Fiji would be validation of what they’ve done so far and a demonstration of how far they’ve come.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/oct/14/england-can-see-their-semi-final-path-and-marcus-smith-has-chance-to-light-the-way">Continue reading...</a>

So they formed a pod, or bubble. “I was like, ‘I’m not going a year without seeing my parents when we don’t know how much longer she has.’ But she’s a marvel. Turns out she’s got a lot more time.” Her smile as she says this is sweet, almost private. “It was great to be able to keep our eyes on them. It was fun to hang out. I like my parents.

Four years ago, on an icily grey day in New York City, I met the actor after watching her gut-wrenching performance on Broadway in the play American Son. I sat on a sofa on the vacated stage, in deep conversation with Washington’s parents, Earl and Valerie: she a professor, he a businessman, who had raised their daughter in a hard-working, predominantly black neighbourhood in the Bronx. I remember thinking how good-looking, charming and erudite they seemed. And Washington – gracious and gorgeous in real life – made so much sense as their offspring.</p><p>If there is a single goal behind Washington’s new memoir, Thicker Than Water, it is explodin

It lies along a track off the road between Knighton and Presteigne near the England-Wales border, looking down from a site of no great elevation, but of seclusion and quiet beauty, on to the valley of the River Lugg. I visited here last week. Swallows and house martins still hawked around in pursuit of sparse insect fare, feeding up before long southwards migration. Swifts had left weeks before.</p><p>I first came to this lovely place 40 years ago. The little church, St Mary’s, with its sturdy bell tower, then had something of a ramshackle, neglected air. My late son Will was with me. I told him the story of Owain Glyndŵr’s great uprising against English rule at the outset of the 15th century. It was here at Pilleth, on 22 June 1402, that he fou
