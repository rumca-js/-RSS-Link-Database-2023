One of the ventures at the forefront of this quest is Sanctuary AI. It&#8217;s a Vancouver, B.C.-based company that has raised more than $100 million Canadian dollars to pursue its vision for labor as a service.

The Seattle retailer confirmed that it recently began testing a partnership with pet giant Petco, which will accept returns from customers who purchased items on Amazon.com.
