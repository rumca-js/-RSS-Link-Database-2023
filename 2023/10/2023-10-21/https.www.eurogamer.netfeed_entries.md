</p><p>Earlier this month, we warned that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/counter-strike-2-players-beware-valve-warns-amds-new-drivers-could-trigger-a-steam-vac-ban">Counter-Strike 2 players with an AMD GPU could face a VAC ban if they activated Anti-Lag+</a>.
</p><p>Unfortunately, the way the Anti-Lag+ feature works - it does its job by "detouring engine dll functions", according to Valve - can have serious consequences for Counter-Strike 2 players who opt to turn it on.

</p><p>Offering minimum, recommended, and ultra specs &ndash; as well as what you'll get if you select low, medium, and high ray tracing settings &ndash; players can assess how their machines will fare when running the PC version&hellip; and it certainly seems that you'll need a pretty powerful rig just to run it, let alone max out the performance.
</p><p>The requirements, which were posted to its social media channels overnight, show that upscalers will be required for 30fps, and the game will take up around 90GB of your storage.

</p><p>The newly-discovered glitch in the soccer sim popped up earlier in the week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-sports-fc-24-glitch-sees-the-ball-incorrectly-stick-to-dribblers-leg">allowing dribblers with the Trickster Playstyle to attach the ball to their calf</a> and then simply run into the opposition's net to score.
</p><p>After first acknowledging the glitch was a problem, EA has now confirmed that it has "temporarily removed" the FUT perk to prevent players from exploiting the bug in competitive play.

</p><p>Twitch CEO Daniel Clancy announced on Twitter/X earlier today that he decided to apply to the Partner Program, but kept the application under wraps to see what would happen.
</p><p>"For anyone that got denied being a Partner from Twitch, don't feel so bad," Clancy said. "Just got my Partner application denied. Did not tell anyone I was applying.

</p><p>That's according to dozens of players posting in the game's official subreddit community, some of whom are reporting that the installation stalls when it hits 36 per cent.
</p><p>According to those who've experienced the issue, it doesn't matter if they take the game back and swap it for a brand new disc &ndash; whatever mitigations they try to put in place, be that turning off internet connection, cleaning the disc, or even a factory reset &ndash; the installation always stops at the same point.

Those tightly-packed boxes leave little room for imagination. Its Jumbo Edition, released in 2018 for its tenth anniversary, breathlessly announces the &ldquo;exciting&rdquo; addition of an investment bank. You couldn't write a finer satire.</p><p>But this is no Cones of Dunshire. Yes, Container is literally a board game about shipping containers. It's also one of the most singular, thrilling gaming experiences I've ever had.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/container-a-board-game-with-the
