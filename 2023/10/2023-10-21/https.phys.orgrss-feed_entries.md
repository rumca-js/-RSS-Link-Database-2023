It's harvest time again for most of Europe's wine growing regions and grapes are being picked from the UK in the north to Sicily in the south. The grapes are then sorted and pressed to make the best juices possible. These juices will then be fermented in a choice of barrel, be that oak, concrete, clay or stainless steel, to make wine ready for blending and bottling in the spring.

## In 250 million years, a single supercontinent will form, wiping out nearly all mammals: Modeling study

A recent study published in Nature Geoscience uses supercomputer climate models to examine how a supercontinent, dubbed Pangea Ultima (also called Pangea Proxima), that will form 250 million years from now will result in extreme temperatures, making this new supercontinent uninhabitable for life, specifically mammals.

## Wildfire smoke leaves harmful gases in floors and walls—air purifiers aren't enough, new study shows

When wildfire smoke turns the air brown and hazy, you might think about heading indoors with the windows closed, running an air purifier or even wearing a mask. These are all good strategies to reduce exposure to the particles in wildfire smoke, but smoky air is also filled with potentially harmful gases. Those gases can get into buildings and remain in the walls and floors for weeks.

## What will happen to the Greenland ice sheet if we miss our global warming targets

It's hard to overstate how crucial Greenland, and its kilometers-thick ice layer, is to climate change. If all that ice melted, the sea would rise by about seven meters—the height of a house.

## New 3D-printed tumor model enables faster, less expensive and less painful cancer treatment

An international team of interdisciplinary researchers has successfully created a method for better 3D modeling of complex cancers. The University of Waterloo-based team combined cutting-edge bioprinting techniques with synthetic structures or microfluidic chips. The method will help lab researchers more accurately understand heterogeneous tumors: tumors with more than one kind of cancer cell, often dispersed in unpredictable patterns.

## Do we live in a computer simulation like in The Matrix? Proposed new law of physics backs up the idea

The simulated universe theory implies that our universe, with all its galaxies, planets and life forms, is a meticulously programmed computer simulation. In this scenario, the physical laws governing our reality are simply algorithms. The experiences we have are generated by the computational processes of an immensely advanced system.

Earth's average temperature in September 2023 was 1.75°C above its pre-industrial baseline, breaching (if only temporarily) the 1.5°C threshold at which world leaders agreed to try and limit long-term warming.

## New study with video shows how female frogs defend themselves against unwanted mating

Among many species, breeding preferences and tactics can differ among males and females. When aggressive behavior by males toward unreceptive females goes awry, it may result in failure to reproduce, and in some cases, fatality for the females involved. This may be particularly true among species of explosive breeders in anurans, an order including some 4,500 species of frogs and toads, in which a higher risk of mortality has been reported for mating females.
