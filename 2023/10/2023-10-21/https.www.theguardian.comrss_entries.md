<ul><li>Dominant England lose semi-final to South Africa by one point</li><li>‘In adversity there’s some seed that will grow and be brilliant’</li></ul><p>Steve Borthwick believes England’s World Cup heartbreak can be the making of his side after their agonising <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/oct/21/england-south-africa-rugby-world-cup-semi-final-match-report" title="">one-point semi-final defeat</a> by South Africa. He declared his pride for his players after pushing the defending champions so close but believes the future is bright for his team despite their going out in devastating fashion.</p><p>England produced their best performance under Borthwick by some distance to lead the world No 1 side 15-9 with 12 minutes to go. A close-range try by RG Snyman and a 78th-minute penalty from Handré Pollard edged South Africa into the final, however, with England beaten by the Springboks for the second World Cup in a row.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023

<p>Striker shares his belief that football needs to be more inclusive to people of all backgrounds and tells how Ian Wright inspires him</p><p>‘Clyde Best laid the ground for every black player in the Premier League today,” says Michail Antonio as he recounts the story, from 1968, of one of the first black footballers to emigrate to England in a social climate stained by the fallout from Enoch Powell’s “rivers of blood” speech in the same year. “His story is crazy, from having to fly from Bermuda to getting directions [at 17] and having to live in digs all on his own. I don’t think I could handle it. I would probably have been fighting.”</p><p>Antonio has just returned from international duty with Jamaica and is in a reflective mood about his career and the challenges he and black players before him have overcome to make it to the top. The West Ham striker has had to fight, though. He is honest about it not always being so rosy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/

After playing for East Northumberland Boys in the morning, he had been invited to a teammate’s house to listen on the wireless to United playing Blackpool in what proved a classic final. Though he and his pals missed much of their 4-2 win through playing football on the street outside, he later said: “It was from that day I wanted to be a footballer and join Manchester United.”</p><p>Sixty years later, on a sodden night in Moscow, after United had beaten Chelsea in the Champions League final, Charlton, his jacket wet through, led the players up to collect their medals, receiving one of his own.

England’s most successful footballer, a player who won all the major honours and was admired for his gentlemanly behaviour<p>Sir Bobby Charlton, who has died aged 86, was one of the greatest footballers England has ever produced.

<p>Sir Bobby Charlton, the England World Cup winner and Manchester United legend, has died. The footballing great played a fundamental part in Alf Ramsey's 1966 World Cup-winning team as well as being an influential member of United's Busby Babes. Charlton signed for United aged 15, winning his first league title in 1957. A year later, his fate changed forever after the Munich air disaster when his side lost many of their players. Charlton was thrust into the starting XI, becoming a key part of Sir Matt Busby's team. During his time at United he won three first division titles, the European Cup and FA Cup. He goes down as one of football's greatest ever players.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2023/oct/21/sir-bobby-charlton-remembering-the-england-and-manchester-united-legend-video-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Since Manchester City’s FA Cup third round victory over Chelsea at the Etihad Stadium in January a lot has happened. That was the start of a record-breaking run that helped Pep Guardiola’s team win a historic treble. Such triumphs can make it a struggle to find the motivation to keep improving but a 21st straight home victory in all competitions over Brighton to surpass Manchester United’s run of 20 more than a decade ago shows how high the standards are under Guardiola.</p><p>As well as finding new methods of inspiring his team, a summer refresh of the squad has brought a new dynamic to City. One of those arrivals, Jérémy Doku was key to their attacking prowess against Brighton. Whenever the winger received the ball, there was a brief hush as fans awaited where his dribbles would end up, the general answer being past James Milner, as the veteran was reminded of his 37 years and the fact he is not a full-back by trade, causing Roberto De Zerbi to do the kindest thing by removing h

<p>The Irish actors rise above Garth Davis’s overly contrived tale of a marriage torn apart by a space mission and an AI replicant</p><p>In a near-future world that has been baked by a climate apocalypse into a state of existential burnout, a young married couple cling to what’s left of their life together in an isolated American prairie homestead. Inherited from his family, it’s a reproachful remnant of the past: a once-loved wooden foursquare farmhouse surrounded by a graveyard of dead trees in formerly rich agricultural land. There may once have been a spark between Junior (Paul Mescal) and Henrietta (Saoirse Ronan), but now their marriage is as arid and unrewarding as the land they no longer attempt to cultivate.</p><p>Then one night a stranger calls: Terrence (Aaron Pierre) is a slick government official who drops a bombshell into their not-so-happy home. Junior has been selected to work on an off-planet space community, and while he is absent he will be replaced, in his home an

## Head for heights: an uplifting Belgian house conversion

Imagination and a sense of fun gave this 1920s Flanders home a low-cost new look<p>The remark about installing a climbing wall in their living room was meant as a joke: “One of the friends my husband goes caving with came to help with the house renovation. When he saw the ceiling height he said: ‘You could have a climbing wall in there,’” explains Sigrid Princen. “Thomas and I said: ‘Yes. Let’s do it!’”</p><p>When the couple bought their home 16 years ago, they knew once they finished the renovation it wouldn’t remain a typical Flanders property. Built in the late 1920s, the house had a series of rooms that ran on from each other at the rear – common to Belgian properties constructed in that period. “We knocked those down and opened the space up with the timber extension,” says Sigrid. What’s peculiar to their home is that the extension has two floors with the mezzanine level housing a bedroom and a small library with a central area that is open and allows light to flow down.</p> <a

<p>With the highly anticipated release of Killers of the Flower Moon, Guardian writers look back at their top Scorsese films</p><p>I’ll let others argue over Scorsese’s gender politics. His lack of female characters has long been a point of contention for feminist film-lovers, and when he does include them, it’s often as wives or adornment. Not so in Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore, his sparkling rom-com starring Ellen Burstyn as a middle-aged woman remaking herself in a man’s world. After her husband dies suddenly, Alice and her wisecracking tween son hit the road, trying to fulfill her childhood dream of becoming a lounge singer. Predictably, she has to dodge hideous men along the way, like leering club owners and a crazed, obsessed younger man (played by a boorish Harvey Keitel). Alice never lets any of this dull her spirit, or suppress her god-tier backtalk. When a creepy barkeep asks her to do a twirl during a job interview, Alice lets out one of my favorite ever lines, one that

<p>A premium autumnal roast salad full of texture and sensation</p><p><a href="https://maxssandwichshop.com/">Max Halley</a>, AKA the Sandwich King, has a mantra for making great sandwiches: “Hot, cold, sweet, sour, crunchy, soft – if you have every one of those six elements, it guarantees deliciousness,” he says. I’d wager the same is true of proper salads – that is, meals, not sides. And most plates of food, actually. With this salad, you have hot roast squash, cold beetroot yoghurt, sweet red onions, a sour lemon dressing, crunchy pumpkin seeds and soft quinoa to bind it all together. If you don’t love it, blame Max.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/oct/21/vegan-recipe-squash-red-onion-quinoa-salad-beetroot-yoghurt-dressing-meera-sodha">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Two years on from being loaned out to the Championship, the centre is set for his international bow against Tonga on Sunday</p><p>There is a smile on Mikey Lewis’s face and a sense of disbelief in his voice when he is asked to recall his journey to a possible Test debut for England on Sunday. The Hull KR half-back, one of the most exciting players in Super League, is likely to get the nod in Shaun Wane’s side for the opening game of the three-match series against Tonga, capping a remarkable rise.</p><p>Two summers ago, Lewis was not even a Super League player, having been sent out to the Championship to learn his craft with York. Even before that, Lewis’s rugby league career had experienced its share of highs and lows, with him almost walking away from the sport. Unable to even secure a place at his amateur side, West Hull, Lewis’s childhood dream was fading.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/oct/21/hull-kr-mikey-lewis-england-chance-tonga-rugby-league">Continue

From the outset, Little Mix were underdogs, expected to exit the competition in the first week. Against all odds, they became the first band (and only girl group) to win.

<p>With their visions of violence and misogyny in small-town America, the Haunting of Hill House author’s chilling tales are taking on a dark new resonance</p><p>I first encountered Shirley Jackson’s The Lottery in fourth grade at an elementary school in a small north-eastern American town not unlike the one where the tale is set. Our teacher, Miss Halloran, liked to give us challenging reading material, so I can only assume she knew what she was doing when she had us read Jackson’s story aloud, each student taking a turn as the tale progressed from its folksy beginning to its shattering conclusion. Glancing up from the page, I saw the expressions of my classmates change, from mild boredom to confusion to shock to outright horror when someone read the tale’s final lines: “‘It isn’t fair, it isn’t right,’ Mrs Hutchinson screamed, and then they were upon her.”</p><p>Published in the New Yorker in June 1948, The Lottery depicts the residents of an “ordinary” small American town indulgin

<p>A tomato and cheese soufflé for sharing, sole cooked in brown butter with saffron and preserved lemon, and crunchy sesame crepe rolls</p><p>It’s a stereotype, I know, but “traditional French cooking” can still seem a bit intimidating. Those tall white chefs’ hats! Those grand-sounding recipe names! Those fancy techniques for making all sorts of pastry! It can all feel rather exclusive, but in reality it’s nothing of the sort. In my experience, there are only two actual “secrets” to French cookery: the first is the <em>mise-en-place</em> (that is, getting everything prepped, chopped and ready before you start cooking, so you can stay on top of timings once you get going). And the second? Butter. Lots and lots of butter.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/oct/21/tomato-souffle-brown-butter-sole-yotam-ottolenghi-french-recipes">Continue reading...</a>

Yet, in Harrods’ defence, there is nothing “just” about two slices of fresh sourdough ensconcing truffle butter, “gold” mustard mayo, mushrooms and seared steak sourced from Japan. These ingredients don’t come cheap: wagyu beef can only come from three breeds of cattle from Japan’s Kasai region and is sometimes referred to as the Rolls-Royce of beef on account of its luxuriant texture and high price tag; black truffle usually costs about £1.50 to £3 a gram, and even the bread takes days to ferment and prove and is baked ton site.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/oct/21/harrods-28-sandwich

<p><strong>Accra, Ghana:</strong> I’m a long way from Scotland, and the dawn chorus is unfamiliar, yet the story of climate-induced flooding is the same</p><p>I’m in Ghana for a month, staying at the Library of Africa and the African Diaspora, and each day my dawn chorus is unfamiliar: the sounds of cocks, chickens, goats, dogs, crickets, motorcycles and human cries intermingle to make up the early morning sounds of Accra. Birdsong too; one particular bird starts its day before dawn and it sounds like it’s asking itself a question then answering itself, impatiently.</p><p>Through the gauze of a mosquito screen, I look down on to a small canopy of cassava plants that are vibrantly green, in a garden with maize, chillies, yams and plantain. Butterflies abound. I hear a bird with a falling cadence like a tree pipit, sparrow-like chirrups, and a cluck resembling a blackbird alarm call, but they’re each not quite the birds I know.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/

<p>Complicated web of relationships are strained as Israel bombards Gaza in retaliation to Hamas attack</p><p>Egypt, which shares a border with Israel and Gaza, has long had a complicated relationship with Hamas, not least due to its genesis as an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood. While Cairo signed a formal peace treaty with Israel in 1978 at Camp David, the Egyptian public has tended to be more pro-Palestinian than successive Egyptian regimes – save for the brief-lived government led by the Muslim Brotherhood that was toppled in 2013. While Cairo has acted as an interlocutor between Hamas and Israel in times of conflict, Egypt has long been wary about a desire by some on the Israeli right for Egypt to take responsibility for Gaza, pointing to the Egyptian administration of the coastal strip from 1948-67.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/21/israel-hamas-war-where-do-surrounding-countries-stand">Continue reading...</a>

Throughout her adolescence, the rightwing populism of Jarosław Kaczyński’s party was the defining force, a series of governments rolling back abortion rights, eroding the rule of law and politicising the state apparatus.</p><p>Now, however, Aleksandra’s generation appears to have fought back, turning out in huge numbers to help oust PiS and its septuagenarian leader from power. “I voted for the first time and I don’t really remember a Poland ruled by the opposition,” said the now 18-year-old student, who preferred not to give her surname.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/21/young-voters-who-shaped-poland-election-result">Continue reading...</a>
