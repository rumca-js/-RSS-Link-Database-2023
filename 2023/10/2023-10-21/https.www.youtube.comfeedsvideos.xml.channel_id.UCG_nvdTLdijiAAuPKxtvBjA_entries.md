In The Nun II, the heroes of the Conjuring cinematic universe must defeat the evil demon nun Valak... once again. And it's the same kind of garbage modern horror movie as we've gotten used to with the likes of The Curse of La Llorona and so on. It's a horror movie that's not scary. These movies keep making the same fundamental mistakes to stumble into those same problems. So as we've done before, let's see why The Nun 2 isn't scary and what you need to avoid to not be like it.
