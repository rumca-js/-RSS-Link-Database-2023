Faraway Downs is a story centered on an English aristocrat, Lady Sarah Ashley (Nicole Kidman) who travels halfway across the world to confront her wayward husband and sell an unusual asset: a million-acre cattle ranch in the Australian Outback called ‘Faraway Downs’. Following the death of her husband, a ruthless Australian cattle baron, King Carney (Bryan Brown), plots to take her land and she reluctantly joins forces with a rough-hewn cattle drover (Hugh Jackman) to protect her ranch. The sweeping adventure romance is explored through the eyes of young Nullah (Brandon Walters), a bi-racial Indigenous Australian child caught up in the government's draconian racial policy now referred to as the “Stolen Generations.” Together the trio experiences four life-altering years, a love affair between Lady Ashley and the Drover, and the unavoidable impact of World War II on Northern Australia. 

Faraway Downs stars Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, Bryan Brown, Brandon Walters, and Ben Mendelsohn.

There’s a new Dragon Ball anime series coming in 2024 called Dragon Ball Daima! Awesome, right? Well, not for anybody expecting the next season of Dragon Ball Super, or something similar to Dragon Ball Z. Dragon Ball Daima’s premise is that Goku, Vegeta, Piccolo and basically everyone else has been turned into small children (or in the case of younger characters, actual babies.) This is undoubtedly a very silly idea for a martial arts anime franchise known for its epic fights and planet-destroying battles, but maybe that’s the idea? Semi-reformed Dragon Ball fan Max Scoville shares his reasons for being excited, waxes nostalgic for the days of Toonami, and reflects on how his appreciation for the work of Akira Toriyama has changed over the years.

Check out the full reveal without some old dork talking over it right here:

Check out this clip from Killers of the Flower Moon featuring Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio. The film also stars Lily Gladstone and Jesse Plemons. 

At the turn of the 20th century, oil brought a fortune to the Osage Nation, who became some of the richest people in the world overnight. The wealth of these Native Americans immediately attracted white interlopers, who manipulated, extorted, and stole as much Osage money as they could before resorting to murder. Based on a true story and told through the improbable romance of Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Mollie Kyle (Lily Gladstone), Killers of the Flower Moon is an epic Western crime saga, where real love crosses paths with unspeakable betrayal. 

Killers of the Flower Moon is directed by Academy Award winner Martin Scorsese from a screenplay by Eric Roth and Martin Scorsese, based on David Grann’s best-selling book. It is produced by Martin Scorsese, Dan Friedkin, Bradley Thomas, and Daniel Lupi. Leonardo DiCaprio, R
