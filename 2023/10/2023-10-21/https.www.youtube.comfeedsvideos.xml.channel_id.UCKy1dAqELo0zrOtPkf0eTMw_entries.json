Awesome, right? Well, not for anybody expecting the next season of Dragon Ball Super, or something similar to Dragon Ball Z. Dragon Ball Daima\u2019s premise is that Goku, Vegeta, Piccolo and basically everyone else has been turned into small children (or in the case of younger characters, actual babies.) This is undoubtedly a very silly idea for a martial arts anime franchise known for its epic fights and planet-destroying battles, but maybe that\u2019s the idea? Semi-reformed Dragon Ball fan Max Scoville shares his reasons for being excited, waxes nostalgic for the days of Toonami, and reflects on how his appreciation for the work of Akira Toriyama has changed over the years.\n\nCheck out the full reveal without some old dork talking over it right here:\nhttps://www.ign.com/articles/new-dragon-ball-series-dragon-ball-daima-confirmed-for-fall-2024-nycc-2023", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ircmIV0yqfw", "date_published": "2023-10-21T15:45:02+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "Ign - YouTube", "album": "Ign - YouTube", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/ircmIV0yqfw/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Killers of the Flower Moon - Official Clip (2023) Robert De Niro, Leonardo DiCaprio", "description": "Check out this clip from Killers of the Flower Moon featuring Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio. The film also stars Lily Gladstone and Jesse Plemons. \n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, oil brought a fortune to the Osage Nation, who became some of the richest people in the world overnight. The wealth of these Native Americans immediately attracted white interlopers, who manipulated, extorted, and stole as much Osage money as they could before resorting to murder. Based on a true story and told through the improbable romance of Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Mollie Kyle (Lily Gladstone), Killers of the Flower Moon is an epic Western crime saga, where real love crosses paths with unspeakable betrayal. \n\nKillers of the Flower Moon is directed by Academy Award winner Martin Scorsese from a screenplay by Eric Roth and Martin Scorsese, based on David Grann\u2019s best-selling book.
