Starward Industries’ upcoming The Invincible is an interesting project that we previously covered in a feature last year. Since then, the developers have shed some more light on not only the game’s setting but also how other elements will tie into the gameplay as well. 

While The Invincible doesn’t do anything new in terms of gameplay mechanics, it’s looking like a game that’s more than the sum of its parts. As such, the game is shaping up to be a game that has something to say and understands how to move forward with such a setting. 

Between this and a buffet of other factors, there’s a strong chance that The Invincible might just end up being one of 2023’s dark horses and also one of my personal favorites of the year.

RoboCop may not be the first series that comes to mind for a first-person shooter. However, it's ripe for fast-paced, over-the-top action with a fair bit of gore.

RoboCop: Rogue City allows players to control the titular robot cop as he keeps Detroit safe from harm. While there are plenty of skirmishes, there's also a fair bit of investigating, interacting with civilians, solving cases and even making decisions to uphold the law or serve the public trust.

RoboCop: Rogue City launches on November 2nd for Xbox Series X/S, PS5 and PC. Here's everything you should know about the shooter before jumping in.

Skull Island: Rise of Kong is an action-adventure game that is trying to tell the story of a young Kong soon after his parents are killed by a vicious dinosaur named Gaw. The core gameplay is a mix of platforming and combat, and the game even has some platforming influences through the use of passages that can only be unlocked by specific abilities.

Unfortunately, the game does a poor job of executing just about every single one of its aspects. Its visuals feel like they use placeholder art, the combat offers no real feedback and never really gives you any incentive to do more than mashing the attack button. Even the game's attempt at making you feel like Kong through his fancy finishing moves fall flat once you realize just how terribly broken these animations are.
