I designed the database schema today, before anything else, so I have a clear understanding of the data structure, its relations, and how data will flow through the application. It's like having a blueprint before constructing a building.
This will allow us to create dummy data in the actual database, fetch those posts, and display them in the app to use when developing the frontend. That's next.

I'm building a platform for programmers and folks interested in computer science to discuss current tech & programming news, how we can utilize it as programmers, and what it means for us and the software development industry. It's under the same umbrella as the Dev Notes newsletter, which is a newsletter for programmers and folks interested in computer science - but the platform is to foster community and encourage discussion
