Since then, the developers have shed some more light on not only the game\u2019s setting but also how other elements will tie into the gameplay as well. \n\nWhile The Invincible doesn\u2019t do anything new in terms of gameplay mechanics, it\u2019s looking like a game that\u2019s more than the sum of its parts. As such, the game is shaping up to be a game that has something to say and understands how to move forward with such a setting. \n\nBetween this and a buffet of other factors, there\u2019s a strong chance that The Invincible might just end up being one of 2023\u2019s dark horses and also one of my personal favorites of the year.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXYAVxGi2yQ", "date_published": "2023-10-21T15:30:11+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/gXYAVxGi2yQ/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "RoboCop: Rogue City - 12 Things You Need To Know Before You Buy", "description": "RoboCop may not be the first series that comes to mind for a first-person shooter.

While there are plenty of skirmishes, there's also a fair bit of investigating, interacting with civilians, solving cases and even making decisions to uphold the law or serve the public trust.\n\nRoboCop: Rogue City launches on November 2nd for Xbox Series X/S, PS5 and PC.

The core gameplay is a mix of platforming and combat, and the game even has some platforming influences through the use of passages that can only be unlocked by specific abilities.\n\nUnfortunately, the game does a poor job of executing just about every single one of its aspects. Its visuals feel like they use placeholder art, the combat offers no real feedback and never really gives you any incentive to do more than mashing the attack button. Even the game's attempt at making you feel like Kong through his fancy finishing moves fall flat once you realize just how terribly broken these animations are.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVPRtGSzrB0", "date_published": "2023-10-21T09:30:04+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/DVPRtGSzrB0/hqdefault.jpg"}]
