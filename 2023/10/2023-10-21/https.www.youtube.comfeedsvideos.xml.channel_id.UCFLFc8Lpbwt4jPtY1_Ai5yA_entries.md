Linus and Luke explore the world of Starfield at launch, in this FPX teaser.  Watch the full 29 minute video and so much more on Floatplane at https://lmg.gg/floatplane2023

This was supposed to be a main LTT video, but we weren't completely satisfied with how it turned out (some of the video issues we experienced are explained by Linus in the video). However, this was still a fun experience overall, and wanted to share it with you here!
