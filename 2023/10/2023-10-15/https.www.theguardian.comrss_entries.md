<p>France’s scrum-half barely put a foot wrong despite a fractured cheek but he was up against a stronger team in Paris</p><p>Off comes the scrum cap. The Stade de France is slowly emptying: of people, of noise, of hope. Antoine Dupont trudges across the turf, dazed and directionless, hands clasped to his head. This is a place he knows and a feeling he does not. He drags his blue jersey up over his face, but the tears do not come yet, and so he pulls it down again. For perhaps the first time on a rugby field, Dupont has no idea what he’s supposed to be doing.</p><p>They broke his face, and then they broke his heart. It will be of little use to him to know that he has played a starring role in perhaps the greatest game ever played. It matters not that over the last few weeks he has won over more converts to this team and this sport than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/18/the-breakdown-jonah-lomu-rugby-union-1995-world-cup" title="">any man since Jonah Lomu</a>.

An extraordinary match of fluctuating fortunes ended with French players scattered across the turf, part in despair, part exhaustion. After Ireland’s agonising failure to consummate their supremacy at the top of the world rankings on Saturday, here the hosts were denied the chance to prevail at their own World Cup. Another in the eye for the global north. South Africa it is, brimming with all that World Cup know-how, who progress to meet the only team left in the tournament from the north, England.</p><p>But that is for another day. What a game we witnessed, the brilliant French so free-running throughout dashed against granite Springbok rock.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/oct/15/france-south-africa-rugby-world-cup-quarter-final-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Kibwe Tavares and Daniel Kaluuya co-direct a drama about a funeral-service worker looking for a way out of the chaotic housing block of the title</p><p>There’s a rich mix of ingredients in this heartfelt and likably acted film from co-directors Kibwe Tavares and Daniel Kaluuya, set in a chaotic, favela-type London housing estate of the near future, nicknamed “the Kitchen”. It takes something from the French banlieue movies of Mathieu Kassovitz and Ladj Ly, while running a seedier and more downbeat version of the postmodern alienation of Total Recall or Blade Runner. But it is also a slightly sentimental-realist family drama, and I felt that for all its high-energy pyrotechnics, in its final moments The Kitchen paints itself into a bit of a narrative corner.</p><p>The Kitchen setting itself is tremendously fabricated on screen, with top-notch special effects work; it is a spectacularly rundown housing block surrounded on all sides by glitzy new apartment buildings for the heartless

<p>With Fiji breathing down their necks in Marseille, Steve Borthwick’s players took the game by the scruff of the neck</p><p>Ten minutes left to play in Marseille, and the game is slipping away from England, taking with it their improbable shot at winning this World Cup. They had been 14 points up just moments ago and the Stade Vélodrome was so quiet, in those moments, that the crowd were throwing Mexican waves. It would have been stretching the point to say you could hear a pin drop, but if you strained your ears you could hear the bones pop and the bodies flop. And then Fiji finally started to play the way only they can. In six minutes they broke the line twice and scored tries both times, 24-10 became 24-22.</p><p>The English didn’t stop to watch the conversion. They were in the one place no team want to be when there’s 10 minutes left to play, when you’re just two points up and the semi-finals are on the line. In a huddle under their own posts.

<p>Our knees, shoulders, necks and hands make all sorts of pops and clicks. Sometimes we even encourage them. But is this the sound of damage being done?</p><p>When Donald Unger was a child, his mother and several aunts – and later his mother-in-law – told him that cracking his knuckles would lead to arthritis. Rather than stop (or at least do it less obtrusively), Unger embarked on his own experimental programme: for 50 years, he cracked the knuckles of his left hand at least twice a day, leaving his right-hand knuckles to crack spontaneously, or not at all. After 36,500 cracks or so, the results were clear, at least for Unger, who had become a doctor and <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/authored-by/Unger/Donald+L.">published his findings</a> in the journal Arthritis and Rheumatism. “There was no arthritis in either hand, and no apparent differences between the two hands,” he concluded.

<p><strong>Sadler’s Wells, London</strong><br />Leading Indian kathak performer Mangaldas explores her desire and confronts the double standards around men’s and women’s sexuality</p><p>Is it audacious for a 63-year-old woman to talk publicly about sexual desire? It’s audacious enough for a 63-year-old woman to front her own solo dance show, the art form most associated with youth, never mind witnessing a grandmother luxuriating in sensation, her body twitching and pulsing, her desire fluttering. There’s nothing salacious about Forbidden. Leading Indian kathak performer Aditi Mangaldas has created work that is earnest and sensitive albeit frank, and quietly outraged at the double standard afforded to men’s and women’s sexuality. Forbidden is a fearless picture of woman as both object and fount of desire.</p><p>The New Delhi-based choreographer has been schooled in kathak dance since childhood, but she makes work that uses her classical roots within a contemporary dance-theatre idiom.

<p>This supposed skewering of macho posturing turns everything into one big joke – and Ed Sheeran’s role is unforgettable in the worst possible way</p><p>We learn two key things from Adam Deacon’s frenetic gang culture parody <em>Sumotherhood</em>. One of these is that Ed Sheeran will apparently do anything for attention, including, it seems, playing a vagrant who defecates in a hedge. File it alongside the dog excrement scene in John Waters’s <em>Pink Flamingos</em> as something we don’t ever need to see again, thanks. The other thing is the fact that skewering the macho posturing and casual sexism of gang culture is never going to work if the film is also, to some degree, in thrall to those same traits.</p><p>It’s a wildly uneven mess. A pity, because Deacon, who stars as well as directs, playing bipolar wannabe street-smart “roadman” Riko, is doing something rather courageous in confronting his own mental health problems. However, by making it all a bit of a larky in-joke, it rath

<p>The actor and writer on hotel breakfasts that trigger his ADHD, and why cooking helps him cope with his troubled past and successful present</p><p>Nick Frost’s new book starts with a recipe for beef stroganoff in his mum’s handwriting that he discovered long after she died. That recollection competes with a memory of his dad’s Sunday lunch, his special way with gravy (involving a can of McEwan’s Export). Also in there is his Welsh auntie’s take on cawl soup, which he now makes for his own three kids; and his trademark “pies in a bowl”, which was a staple of the time he shared a flat with his eternal friend and collaborator Simon Pegg. Though cooking has always been something like therapy for Frost, it was only when a publisher asked him to write a cookbook that he realised that the story of his life was there in the – 300 or so – dishes he could make. Frost’s childhood had been derailed by his father’s bankruptcy and his mother’s alcoholism; the recipes are the good part of his me

Out go the pews, in comes the trampoline… A church in rural Ontario gets a major makeover<p>From the outside, the 19th-century redbrick church in the rural village of Sheffield, Ontario, gives very little away. “We deliberately kept the exterior traditional,” explains Matt Barnes, who lives here with his partner, Nikki Ross, and his two daughters. Other than Barnes’s “weird collection of cars” – a 1980s Porsche, a 1970s Chevy pickup, a 1960s Pontiac muscle car and a 1930s hot rod – there’s not much to suggest the tumult of colour, pattern and pop culture that lies within.</p><p>Barnes, a director and photographer and director, bought the church with his now ex-wife seven years ago.

For generations, the Reels family has owned a chunk of what was swamp land and is now prime waterfront real estate. Then, in the 80s, in murky circumstances, a company called Adams Creek Associates struck a contested deal in which it claimed to have bought just over five hectares (13 acres) of the land. The problem was that the Reels family never agreed to this. And the two brothers, Melvin and Licurtis, who lived on the land were sued by the property developers for trespassing. The court found in favour of Adams Creek Associates; consequently, Melvin and Licurtis spent eight years in prison.</p><p>Peck’s film – which, wit

<p>Food TV’s brightest new star on Big Eats, how fame just snowballed for him – and the secret to his mac and cheese</p><p>Big Zuu arrived at last year’s Bafta TV awards as the underdog. He’d been serving food to comedians on his cooking and chat show, <em>Big Zuu’s Big Eats</em>, since 2020. He talks to famous people about what they love to eat and then he knocks them up a three-course meal in his van, with the help of his best friends, Tubsey and Hyder. But the show was on its third season on Dave, and though it was one of the channel’s top performers, it still had a relatively small audience. It was up for best entertainment performance and best feature, against mainstream titans such as Graham Norton, Michael McIntyre, Alison Hammond and <em>The Great British Sewing Bee</em>. To Zuu’s obvious amazement, he won both categories. “Growing up, there wasn’t many chefs or people that look like me on telly,” he said, accepting his first award. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQ

Turn an abundance of cauliflowers and a glut of figs into a simple, filling lunch or dinner, followed by a jammy fig pudding<p>I was unprepared for the height to which the fig tree would grow, or how the vast dinner-plate leaves would crash to the floor, almost in unison, each autumn. More pertinently, I had little notion of the number of fruits it would eventually produce, most of which are too high to reach even with the ladder. Perhaps it was the naivety of a new homeowner let loose on his first garden, or perhaps I failed to do my homework… whatever, 20 years on she is magnificent, with golden leaves like giants’ hands, almost translucent in the autumn sun, and still producing fruit.</p><p>The extraordinary weather this summer has sent the tree into shock, at one point dropping almost an entire harvest of unripe figs on the kitchen steps.

It’s one of an endless number of paradoxes about my diminutive friend and beauty therapist. She is under 5ft tall, with sturdy olive skin, tousled hair, and a fondness for pedal-pusher playsuits, so it’s hard to guess her age. In truth, she’s almost 50, but still frequents raves. She cares for her brother, and her mum, who has been in the UK for a lifetime but still only speaks Portuguese.

Or at least it would feel like that.</p><p>The same could not be said for spaghetti carbonara – it’s not very good for you, and yet I have often found eating it to be a test of endurance.

<p>The Paris-based British<strong> </strong>playwright, back at the National Theatre with The Confessions, inspired by conversations with his mother, talks about the secrets she revealed and the heroism of unexceptional lives</p><p>“I am always thinking in theatre how to be useful, how not to make it about me,” says playwright Alexander Zeldin, with a slight frown. “I think theatre has a unique quality which is that it’s at once very private and incredibly public. You are experiencing something in your own mind and heart when you are watching other people.”</p><p>Zeldin’s new play, <em>The Confessions</em>, which opened in Vienna and arrives at the National Theatre as part of a European tour this week, extends that tension between internal and external, between a personal reflection and collective history. About the life of a woman called Alice, the play spans the period from 1943 to 2021, from birth until death, and is based on conversations with his mother. “It feels transgressive

The 31,500 feet Hoffner dove from, or the fact that she was going to be 105 years old in December?</p><p>To me, it’s that this was her second skydive; she took her first when she was a sprightly 100 years old.

## Facial oils: 10 of the best

Applying oils to your skin can seem a little heavy handed, but the new generation of products are worth considering for a whole range of skin types<p>I have long been wary of facial oils. Call it a hangover from my teenage years when even the thought of applying any kind of oil to my breakout-prone skin would make me, well, break out. Years ago, an aesthetician told me that no “serious” skincare formulations included oils, which made me double down on my anti-facial-oil rhetoric. But I’ve decided to give my nemesis a chance because this column is not just about me. Hence, you may spot things like a purple shampoo for blonde hair in my reviews. (I glean its efficacy from willing guinea pigs). Also, I have met a plethora of women – varied skin types, textures, tones – who swear by facial oils and have the skin to prove it. I cannot ignore that. And then, fundamentally, facial oils have changed. There are “serious” formulations with oil in them. Ones that are super-effective at tackling

They want to win,” remarked a different member of the shadow cabinet at the conclusion of the gathering in Liverpool.

He’s one of Hollywood’s greatest stars – and one of its most private. At 80, he has become a father again, has just made another Scorsese film and is still outspoken about the dangers of Donald Trump<p>For a very long time, the actor Robert De Niro was reticent in interviews. He was solitary or shy or inarticulate – biographers couldn’t decide which. Then Donald Trump was made president, and public De Niro – the De Niro we read in magazines, who appeared at Hollywood events – became openly, angrily, exasperatedly chatty, at least on politics. Trump was a New Yorker, like De Niro, but not a <em>good</em> New Yorker, it turns out. He was a “fool”, a “bozo”, a “national disaster”. How could he have become president? Why weren’t more Americans embarrassed, or terrified? “Fuck Trump!” he shouted while appearing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/11/robert-de-niro-wins-ovation-fuck-trump-speech-tony-awards" title="">at an awards ceremony</a> in 2018.

<p>Mary Harron’s frustratingly elusive Salvador Dalí portrait has a persuasive central turn but its star has little to get his teeth into</p><p>How do you create a revealing and intimate portrait of someone who is forever playing a self-created role? How do you find something that is honest in a character who is composed of onion layers of artifice? It’s a problem with which writer-director Mary Harron wrestles in her latest film, an account of a late period in the life of the surrealist artist Salvador Dalí, and one that she fails to resolve entirely. The Dalí persona, the film argues, was as much an artistic creation as any of his paintings. Dalí was something to be experienced rather than someone to be known.</p><p>This is all very well, but it doesn’t exactly give <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/ben-kingsley">Ben Kingsley </a>much to get his teeth into in the central role.

<p>The pioneering German film‑maker, actor and writer answers questions from Observer readers and famous fans including John Waters, Nicole Kidman and Wim Wenders</p><p>“Can you see me? Can you hear me?” implores Werner Herzog, as we pop up in our little boxes – or don’t – at the start of our video call. I can both see and hear him without distortion: that idiosyncratic German timbre, so familiar from his 60 years of film-making, couldn’t be anyone else. But the problem is with my connection. “You’re frozen,” he sighs, with palpable anguish. “It’s very… disquieting. I see your face and wait for lip movements or some life, but there ain’t any life.”</p><p>This (one-sided) exchange is the perfect introduction to the 81-year-old Herzog, who has written and directed more than 60 films and who is, no question, one of the most pioneering documentarians of our age. He also acts, stages operas and is a gifted author. To all of these projects Herzog brings his voice, a searing intensity and a
