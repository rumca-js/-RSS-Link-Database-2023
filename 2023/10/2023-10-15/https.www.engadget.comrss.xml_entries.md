<p>We’re not quite done with the busy fall season of tech events. It’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/baidu/"><ins>Baidu’s</ins></a> turn to reveal what it has been cooking up. The company will host its Baidu World showcase on October 16th at 10PM ET.</p>
<p>After several years of holding the event entirely virtually, Baidu is returning to an in-person format with &quot;real-world demos and experiences&quot; for the first time since 2019.

<p>Siri and Alexa were only the beginning. As voice recognition and speech synthesis technologies continue to mature, the days of typing on keyboards to interact with the digital world around us could be coming to an end — and sooner than many of us anticipated. Where today's virtual assistants exist on our mobile devices and desktops to provide scripted answers to specific questions, the LLM-powered generative AI copilots of tomorrow will be there, and everywhere else too. This is the "voice-first" future Tobias Dengel envisions in his new book, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL1NvdW5kLUZ1dHVyZS1Db21pbmctVm9pY2UtVGVjaG5vbG9neS9kcC8xNTQxNzAyMzYwP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTR0Yi0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYzFhYW
