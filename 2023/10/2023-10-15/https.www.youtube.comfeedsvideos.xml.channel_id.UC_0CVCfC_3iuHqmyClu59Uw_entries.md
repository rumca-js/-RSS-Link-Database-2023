In this video, we'll delve into the all-new Google Pixel 8 Pro, exploring its capabilities and putting it to the test. With the mighty Tensor G3 at its core and a substantial 12GB of RAM backing it up, we'll find out if the Pixel 8 Pro can handle demanding games such as Genshin Impact, Call of Duty Mobile, and more. Additionally, we'll push the boundaries by experimenting with various emulators on the Pixel 8 Pro, including Dolphin for Gamecube and Wii, PPSSPP for PSP, and even AetherSX2 for PS2 emulation. As a bonus, we'll take a quick look at the Pixel Watch 2!

I'd like to clarify that Google sent this device as a gift, but the thoughts and opinions expressed in this video are entirely my own.
