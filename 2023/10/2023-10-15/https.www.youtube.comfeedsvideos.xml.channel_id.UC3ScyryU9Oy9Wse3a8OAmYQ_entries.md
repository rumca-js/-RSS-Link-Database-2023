On November 8, 2018, the deadliest and most destructive fire in California history began. By the time it finally would be extinguished, the fast-moving Camp Fire had burned an area the size of Chicago, caused more than 50,000 people to flee their homes and killed at least 85 people.

In this FRONTLINE Short Doc, watch as Jordan Huff shares her firsthand account of fleeing the flames – “We were all about to burn alive,” she says – and learn how scientists say climate change is making wildfires more frequent and intense.
