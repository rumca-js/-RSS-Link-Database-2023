Or should I even bother? I'll talk about what I think about that, and of course, I'll answer your wargaming-related questions. Come have fun!\n\nVince Venturella and I made another game! Check out MAJESTIC 13 at http://www.majestic13game.com\n\nI'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly).
