I'm nearly done with my Imperial Guard Combat Patrol (which will be my third completed Combat Patrol) and now I'm wondering: what Combat Patrol should I paint next? Or should I even bother? I'll talk about what I think about that, and of course, I'll answer your wargaming-related questions. Come have fun!

Vince Venturella and I made another game! Check out MAJESTIC 13 at http://www.majestic13game.com

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
