While dad Mack is content to keep his family safe paddling around their New England pond forever, mom Pam is eager to shake things up and show their kids, teen son Dax and duckling daughter Gwen, the whole wide world. After a migrating duck family alights on their pond with thrilling tales of far-flung places, Pam persuades Mack to embark on a family trip, via New York City, to tropical Jamaica. As the Mallards make their way South for the winter, their well-laid plans quickly go awry. The experience will inspire them to expand their horizons, open themselves up to new friends and accomplish more than they ever thought possible, while teaching them more about each other, and themselves, than they ever imagined.\n\nMigration r", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUug2tqmgHw", "date_published": "2023-10-15T12:02:03+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "KinoCheck", "album": "KinoCheck", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/IUug2tqmgHw/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCLRlryMfL8ffxzrtqv0_k_w", "title": "Invincible Season 2 Trailer 2 (2023)", "description": "Official Invincible Series Trailer 2 2023 | Subscribe \u27a4 https://abo.yt/ki | Steven Yeun Series Trailer | Prime Video: 3 Nov 2023 | More https://KinoCheck.com/show/pgv/invincible-2021?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description\nINVINCIBLE is an adult animated superhero series that revolves around 17-year-old Mark Grayson (Steven Yeun), who\u2019s just like every other guy his age \u2014 except his father is the most powerful superhero on the planet, Omni-Man (J.K.
