Here, we're going to look at a few that you may have missed.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjFhakVpwF0", "date_published": "2023-10-30T16:00:44+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/wjFhakVpwF0/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Football Manager 2024 vs. Football Manager 2023 - 15 BIGGEST CHANGES", "description": "As an annual franchise,\u00a0Football Manager\u00a0obviously doesn't make too many radical changes from year to year, and yet even so, it's one of very few franchises in its category that does tend to make meaningful \u2013 if small and iterative \u2013 changes with each new instalment. \n\nAnd though next year's game will see the series shaking things up quite drastically, in the here and now, Football Manager 2024\u00a0is very much sticking to the tradition of several iterative improvements coming together in impressive fashion.

As Thomas delves deeper into the facility, things quickly start jumping off the rails, and he now has to fight off mysterious combatants with a single objective: no witnesses.\n\nUnfortunately, Quantum Error feels like a much more ambitious game than the studio seemed capable of. The title\u2019s combat feels incredibly generic, and often downright terrible thanks to the lack of real feedback on whether you\u2019re even hitting enemies. There is also an emphasis on stealth, despite the game not really providing any tools to make sneaking around interesting. These gameplay issues, combined with a story that had the potential to be interesting if it had better characterization, voice acting, and direction, make Quantum Error a downright boring game.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BodiKm1oZMY", "date_published": "2023-10-30T14:00:08+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GamingBolt", "album": "GamingBolt", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/BodiKm1oZMY/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 (2023) - 10 Things YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED TO KNOW Before You Buy", "description": "With all the controversy around Call of Duty this year, mainly focused on Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard, it's easy to forget that a new game is out this year.
