Video Game news can be cool! Or boring! Or lame! Usually it’s pretty lame though! Today I’m gonna speedrun through some of my issues with the gaming news industry, and how gaming journalism isn’t quite as “gaming journalism” as it might seem.

From Xbox to PlayStation, EA to….PlayStation, there’s so many big businesses that seem to have their hands in all the cookie jars.

But not this one.

Not mine.

Unless they wanted to, I mean I’m not against the idea.

Phil Spencer probably still loves me.

I’ll also make fun of Disney a bit, because I feel like it.
