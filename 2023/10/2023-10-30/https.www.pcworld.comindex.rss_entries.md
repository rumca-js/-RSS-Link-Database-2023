<p>It&rsquo;s been a long time coming, but Windows 11 can now unpack some of the most popular compression files on the web. Initially <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1929635/windows-finally-gets-native-rar-and-7-zip-support.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">announced back in May</a>, the new <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2120388/windows-11-now-receives-biggest-update-moment-4-available-for-all-users.html">&ldquo;Moment 4&rdquo; update</a> adds <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2115354/nadella-copilot-is-the-new-windows-start-button.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">a bunch of Copilot AI features</a> and more. But who cares about that, because it also lets Windows natively access 7-Zip, RAR, GZ, and many other popular compression and archiving file formats. </p>

<p>On my somewhat cramped Micro-ATX motherboard, the M.2 slots for today&rsquo;s teeny-tiny SSDs are between the PCIe slots&hellip;which means that the drives sit right under my graphics card. In terms of thermal management this is <s>completely frickin&rsquo; bonkers</s> less than ideal. That goes double if you want to use a PCIe 5.0 drive with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1504081/gigabytes-newest-ssd-has-a-heatsink-with-its-own-zip-code.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">optional massive coolers</a>. Asus might have figured out a solution with its latest graphics card design, which lets an M.2 slot piggy-back right on the rear of the graphics card itself. </p>



<p>The Asus GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 8GB Dual OC + 2280M.2 SSD Expansion slot (yes, that is its full product name <em>oh my god</em>) does what it says on the box. On the rear of the

<p>Microsoft is now making update KB5031455 for Windows 11 available for download and installation in a preview version via Windows Update. This means that even more people can now receive the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2071752/windows-11-23h2-update-sept-26-copilot-rar-support-more.html">massive &ldquo;Moment 4&rdquo; feature update</a> in advance of a wider rollout. </p>



<p>In September 2023, the Moment 4 preview was only sent to Windows 11 Insider preview testers. But now, any Windows 11 user who activates the &ldquo;Get the latest updates as soon as they are available&rdquo; option in Windows Update should also see KB5031455 and can install it manually if they wish. On November&rsquo;s Patch Tuesday (i.e. on November 14), Microsoft will finally offer the update for automatic installation on all Windows 11 computers via Windows Update. </p>
