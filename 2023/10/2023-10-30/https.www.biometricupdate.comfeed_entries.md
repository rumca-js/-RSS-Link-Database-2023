		In Southampton, England, bouncers at seven different venues will wear cameras with facial recognition in a 3 month trial to combat crime and identify barred individuals, according to <a href="https://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/23876664.southampton-bouncers-wear-facial-recognition-cameras/">Daily Echo</a>.

GO! Southampton, the city's business improvement district, partnered with security firm Synergy Security to run the trial, which is the first in the UK. The trial will use <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/reveal-media">Reveal</a>’s digital evidence management system, DEMS 360, which is the same system used by roughly 70 percent of UK police.

This biometric system is an extension of the “red card” scheme of the Southampton Business Crime Partnership

		As police authorities in the United Kingdom search for more ways to include facial recognition in their work, the country’s privacy watchdogs and rights groups have been raising alarms over surveillance fears and legal issues.

In a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/letter-to-police-on-ai-enabled-facial-recognition-searches">letter to police chiefs</a> published on Sunday, the country’s Policing Minister Chris Philp said that the UK police should use live recognition more widely to quickly identify suspects and deter crime.

“AI technology is a powerful tool for good, with huge opportunities to advance policing and cut crime,” says Philp.

The call came after police caught three at-large suspects using live facial recognition technology during last month’s Ar

		Jamaican government officials say they will factor in proposals made by members of the public and the private sector to a draft regulation that would oversee how the country’s new digital ID rolls out.

The regulation is specifically about how the National Identification and Registration Inspectorate (NIRI) and the National Identification and Registration Authority (NIRA) will work together to run the digital ID system. It also offers the basis for a framework that would guarantee the security and protection of personal data, officials have assured.

Dr. Warren Vernon, program director of the Jamaica National Identification System (NIDS) told a press conference after a cabinet meeting recently that adjustments are being made to the system after a pilot, and from publi

		An international 39-member United Nations advisory group has been appointed to report on global governance of AI.

Almost simultaneously, United States officials are preparing national standards that officials say will defang AI and ensure the nation remains the global leader in "responsible innovation" of the algorithms.

Both initiatives are ambitious.

Somewhere between the two is a voluntary code of conduct for AI developers released today by the G7 group of economic ministers.

U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres last week <a href="https://media.un.org/en/asset/k10/k10lmso2aa">said</a> the large committee he has created will tease apart AI's many risks and promises and come up with policy recommendations by summer 2024. Formal presentation is expected in Septem
