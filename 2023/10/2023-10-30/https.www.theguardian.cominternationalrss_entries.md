<p>There are ways you can stay across the news without succumbing to secondary or vicarious trauma </p><p>The ongoing conflict in Israel and Gaza has once again brought to the forefront the grim realities of war and its impact on innocent civilians. As we’re flooded with images and stories of destruction, suffering, and loss, it’s natural to feel a deep sense of sadness, empathy, helplessness and, of course, anger and dismay at what we are witnessing. Many are finding it increasingly challenging to balance their desire to stay informed with the emotional toll this crisis can take. Unfortunately, this can lead to secondary trauma.</p><p>Secondary trauma, also known as vicarious trauma, is a phenomenon where individuals experience symptoms of trauma as a result of witnessing or hearing about traumatic events happening to others, even if they aren’t directly involved. In the context of the Israel-Gaza crisis, secondary trauma can manifest as feelings of grief and extreme sadness, anxiet

<p>The 90s were a decade of carefree optimism and comically low stakes. Matthew Perry’s death brings us crashing back into the now </p><p>In 2004, the author Damian Barr published Get It Together: Surviving Your Quartlerlife Crisis. Barr would go on to write poignant and beautiful books (including the memoir Maggie and Me) but this wasn’t either of those things. It was more of a fun, generational howl: how’s this stuff supposed to work? How are you supposed to become an adult in these conditions? The dream of life in your 20s – flailing around not sure what to do, mooching from one dead-end job to another but still managing to afford a gigantic, lovely flat in the centre of everything, failing romantically, hilariously, while it all turns out for the best, never feeling anxious for no reason or as if you’re slipping through the sieve of polite society, too small and weightless to remain in the in-crowd – well, that dream was cracking a little. As Barr put it in a radio interview, the

Look at it. It’s just incredible.”</p><p>It is a typical response to a first experience of Santa Anita, a racecourse which has few, if any, equals in terms of its setting and has been leaving people wide-eyed for nearly a century. The de’Lemos’s, though, are anything but typical racehorse owners, and the story of their journey to the Breeders’ Cup meeting here on Saturday – completed in economy class on Saturday – is a welcome reminder that even at this most glamourous of events, ther

<p>A puff piece masquerading as a real documentary fails to capture what makes the unlikely star such an interesting anomaly</p><p>As told by the new documentary Sly, the biography of Sylvester Stallone plays a lot like one of the Rocky pictures he shepherded to the screen as writer, star and eventual director: the rousing underdog story of a gutsy neighborhood kid who pulled himself up by his bootstraps to win everyman glory, then did it again when everyone counted him out.</p><p>He busts through these cliches of triumph by virtue of really having lived them, an authenticity evident in his exquisite blue-collar brogue and meathead-philosopher manner of speech. Born in Hell’s Kitchen back when it still deserved the nickname, growing up an unflappably confident jock despite or perhaps because of his father’s constant abuse, he muscled his way into showbusiness through sheer force of will. Casting agents didn’t see leading-man material in this slab of ground chuck, so he crafted himsel

So I’ve built a list of alternative milestones</p><p>A friend came over for dinner recently and brought her newborn daughter. She was adorable, giggling, drooling and kicking her legs with gusto (the baby, not my friend). My husband and I are very open about the fact that we don’t want to have children. I am child-free by choice, and it feels like an important distinction to make: I have never tried to get pregnant, and I have no idea how my body would work – or not work – in that department. It will probably always remain a mystery. It means that my friends with kids tend to give me the honest truth about their parenting life. There’s no pretending things are better or worse than they are and I feel privileged to witness the good, the bad and the ugly. My friend told me her baby was sleeping like an absolute dream – and that she probably isn’t going to share that with any of the pals sh
