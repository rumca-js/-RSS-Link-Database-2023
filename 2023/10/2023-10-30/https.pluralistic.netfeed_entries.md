Today's links Zuck's gravity-defying metaverse money-pit: $46.5 billion incinerated and he's richer than ever. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2003, 2008, 2013, 2018 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading Zuck's gravity-defying metaverse money-pit (permalink) Think of everything that makes you miserable as being caught between two opposing, irresistible, irrefutable truths: "Anything that can't go on forever eventually stops" (Stein's Law) "Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent" (Keynes) Both of these are true, even though they seemingly contradict one another, and no one embodies that contradiction more perfectly than Mark Zuckerberg.
