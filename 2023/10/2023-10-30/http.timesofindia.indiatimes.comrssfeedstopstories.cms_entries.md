The bombs used in the attack on a Jehovah Witnesses congregation in Ernakulam, Kerala were radio frequency-activated improvised explosive devices (IEDs) packed with low-grade explosives and petrol pouches. The IEDs were triggered by a radio-frequency based mechanism, possibly a mobile phone signal. It is believed that the bomber was not far from the site at the time of the blasts. The IEDs were packed in jute bags and placed under separate chairs covered with cloth to maximize the incendiary effect. The nature and composition of the IEDs suggest that the bomber was an amateur who learned how to assemble them from the internet.

Style and class has never been a problem with 'SKY'. He has given ample display of that in T20 cricket, a format he has bossed with remarkable ease. However some of his low scores in ODIs did raise questions if he is unable to blend a bit of serenity in his all or nothing approach, which is perfectly in sync with T20s but not the 50-over format.
