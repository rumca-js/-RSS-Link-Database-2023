<p>Communities around the world impacted by the plastics giant Formosa are launching a global hunger strike on October 31. <br />
Fishers, organizers, and concerned citizens in Texas, Vietnam and Louisiana — areas that are home to existing or proposed Formosa plants — have supported each other's efforts to mobilize against the Taiwan-based firm, forming the organization International Monitor Formosa Alliance (IMFA). Now the alliance is launching a hunger strike to demand that the victims of a 2016 environmental disaster in central Vietnam caused by Formosa Ha Tinh Steel Corporation, a subsidiary of the Formosa Plastics Group, be compensated for their losses, that the polluted area be restored, and that those who have been jailed for protesting be released.</p>
