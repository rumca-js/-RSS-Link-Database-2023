Initially formed in 1973 by jazz guitarist John McLaughlin with virtuoso traditional Indian musicians, the band opened the doors for others to expand their musical appreciation beyond Western music. 50 years later, as guitarist McLaughlin reunites with tabla player Zakir Hussain to take Shakti on another world tour, the group stopped by for a magically inspiring performance behind the Tiny Desk.\n\n\"Shrini's Dream\" sets the stage with both melodic and rhythm instruments, before vocalist Shankar Mahadevan, violinist Ganesh Rajagopalan and McLaughlin each take turns calling out to the muse for inspiration. The entire set is a drummer's dream given Hussain is considered a master tabla player both within and outside the tradition.\n\nShakti's music has always been built around complex traditional rhythms and they are on full display with Hussain and Selvaganes", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx8AaSvH4EQ", "date_published": "2023-10-30T09:00:08+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "NPR Music", "album": "NPR Music", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/Cx8AaSvH4EQ/hqdefault.jpg", "age": null, "page_rating_contents": 0, "page_rating_votes": 0, "page_rating_visits": 0, "page_rating": 0}]
