Australasia has likely overlooked a pollination crisis, according to new research published today in the journal Ecology and Evolution. The research, led by Macquarie University, also underscores a pressing need for intervention to avoid biodiversity loss and long-term food insecurity in the region.

Ciliate protozoa possess the remarkable ability to reproduce through both asexual and sexual means. Their distinctive sexual process involves conjugation and autogamy, and they wield a secret weapon: extraordinary nuclear dimorphism. Within each cell resides both a germline micronucleus (MIC) and a somatic macronucleus (MAC). When subjected to fluorescent staining, their sexual processes transform into a captivating kaleidoscope of vibrant colors, creating a cellular carnival of vibrant colors.

Economic transitions take time but do take place. New York City first became prominent as a trading city, with America's resources and farm goods delivered via the Erie Canal shipped out of the port of New York. Then, we became a manufacturing city, at one time making nearly all the clothing worn in America. Today, we are a center of finance, communication, fashion design, entertainment, the arts, health care, research, and education.

In 1895, Wilhelm Röntgen discovered X-rays and used them to image the bones in his wife's hand, kicking off a revolutionary diagnostic tool for medicine. Now two of NASA's X-ray space telescopes have combined their imaging powers to unveil the magnetic field "bones" of a remarkable hand-shaped structure in space. Together, these telescopes reveal the behavior of a dead collapsed star that lives on through plumes of particles of energized matter and antimatter.

The rich diversity of organic compounds is a result of the remarkable ability of carbon atoms to connect and form bonds with different molecules. Variations in these bonding arrangements, as well as the types of atoms and functional groups involved, result in the formation of isomers. They are a type of compound that shares the same molecular formula but exhibits distinct three-dimensional shapes and properties.

According to forecasts, even the strategy to gradually reduce climate gas emissions to zero everywhere will no longer be enough to limit global heating to well below 2°C. Today, the discussion is also about "negative emissions," i.e., the removal of the most important greenhouse gas, CO2, from the atmosphere. Under the heading of "solar radiation management," some are even talking about a potential reflection of incoming sunlight.

Infectious diseases severely threaten public health and global biosafety. In addition to transmission through the air, pathogenic microorganisms have also been detected in environmental liquid samples, such as sewage water. The various methodologies utilized in the clinical diagnosis of pathogens are often time-consuming and cost-ineffective, and their detection limits are not satisfactory for processing environmental samples, which contain only scant amounts of microorganismal DNA/RNA.

Apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) breeding is a resource-intensive and time-consuming process. Although a large number of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with apple fruit appearance and quality traits have been reported, fewer QTLs have been translated into locus-specific traits for use in breeding, while many apple fruit quality traits are genetically complex and may be influenced by many minor-effect QTLs throughout the genome.

Australia's national environment protection law ignores the big picture. Like a racehorse wearing blinkers, decision-makers focus on a single project in isolation. If they dropped the blinkers and considered the combined effects of multiple projects, they might shy away from allowing so many harmful impacts.

Due to their versatile properties, materials consisting of five or more elements are of great interest for this purpose. With approximately 50 usable elements of the periodic table, there is an almost infinite number of feasible materials.

NASA's Lucy mission will soon have its first asteroid encounter as the spacecraft travels through deep space en route to Jupiter's orbit. But before the spacecraft passes 265 miles (425 kilometers) from the surface of the small asteroid Dinkinesh, researchers have used 13-year-old infrared data from NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) to support the mission's flyby. Their new study provides updated estimates of the asteroid's size and albedo—a measurement of surface reflectivity—that could help scientists better understand the nature of some near-Earth objects.

There are high hopes for hydrogen as the key to the energy transition. A specific enzyme group found in algae and in bacteria can produce molecular hydrogen simply by catalyzing protons and electrons. However, the enzyme group is so sensitive to oxygen that commercial use of the hydrogen produced by this process as a green energy source is not yet possible.

Distant, early galaxies, nascent planets forming in dusty disks, and the end of the universe's dark ages and its first light were on the list. But exoplanets were also on the list, and there were thousands of them beckoning to be studied.

On January 3, 2019, China's Chang'e-4 lander touched down on the far side of the moon and deployed the Yutu rover. In addition to its many instruments, the rover carried an important science experiment known as the Biological Experiment Payload (BEP). Over the next eight days, this payload conducted a vital experiment where it attempted to grow the first plants on the moon. Included in the payload were cotton, potato, arabidopsis, and rape seeds, along with fly eggs, yeast, and 18 ml (0.6 fluid oz) of water, which was kept at a constant atmospheric pressure.

Most of the planets in the universe orbit a star. They are part of a system of planets, similar to our own solar system. But a few planets drift alone in the cosmos. For whatever reason, be it a near collision or slow gravitational perturbations that destabilize its orbit, these planets are cast out of their star system and sent adrift. These rogue planets are notoriously challenging to find, but as we start to discover them we're finding they are a bit more common than we'd thought. Now a new study posits a reason why.

As key regulators, pentatricopeptide repeat proteins (PPRs) function in ribonucleic acid (RNA) editing, organellar gene expression, photosynthesis, the organellar electron transport chain, cellular metabolism, and adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) production. Deficiencies in the functions of PPRs often result in organelle dysfunction, defects in growth and embryo development, or abnormal stress sensitivity. However, the role of PPRs in disease resistance in kiwifruit remains unclear, and the underlying role of RNA editing is not fully understood.

Imagine a world without powders. It may sound exaggerated, but our daily lives are intricately connected to powders in various ways from foods, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics to batteries, ceramics, etc. In all these industries, powder mixing is an important unit operation where different types of powders are mixed to achieve uniformity. However, it can be difficult to predict what conditions are optimal to achieve the desired uniformity as the process often relies on trial and error as well as engineers' expertise.

Researchers from Tokyo Metropolitan University have used fruit flies to study how daily eating patterns are regulated. They found that the quasimodo (qsm) gene helped sync feeding to light/dark cycles, but not in constant darkness: instead, the genes clock (clk) and cycle (cyc) keep eating/fasting cycles, while other "clocks" in nerve cells help sync it to days. Deciphering the molecular mechanism behind eating cycles helps us understand animal behavior, including our own.
