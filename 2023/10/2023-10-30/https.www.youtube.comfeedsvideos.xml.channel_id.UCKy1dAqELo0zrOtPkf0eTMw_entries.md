In today's Daily Fix:
An update to the last-gen game Batman: Arkham Knight added the batsuit from last year's The Batman. Then, as suddenly as it appeared, it was taken out, leading some to think the update was released prematurely. In other news, Skull and Bones has been delayed again. Surprise, surprise. But Ubisoft's Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora and new Prince of Persia game are still on track. And finally, Tom Hardy gave props to Tony Todd for his performance as Venom in Marvel's Spider-Man 2. Game respect game.

## Dead Island 2 Haus DLC Review

Dead Island 2: Haus DLC reviewed by Travis Northup on PC. Also available on Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5. 

I enjoyed revisiting Dead Island 2 for an evening of gore-filled good times with its Haus DLC, but with very few additions to shake up gameplay and a surprisingly short runtime, there isn’t much here worth diving  back in to see on its own. It certainly has a few laughs to offer, some beautiful new areas to explore, and a crossbow that’s actually pretty fun to use, but it only took half an hour of fighting the same undead goons from the base game for me to grow sick of them all over again. Unless you’ve got a great desire to drink the Kool-Aid, you might be better off waiting for additional DLC before making a return to Hell-A.
