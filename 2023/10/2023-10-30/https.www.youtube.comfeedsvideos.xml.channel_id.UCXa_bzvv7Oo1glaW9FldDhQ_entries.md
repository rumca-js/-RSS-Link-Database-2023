Until not that long ago, many of us wouldn't have imagined that we'd be seeing Metal Gear making any sort of a meaningful comeback anytime soon, but with Konami having announced Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, long-suffering series fans are finally seeing some light at the end of the tunnel. 

After its announcement earlier this year, much more recently, we also got a first look at some in-engine gameplay as part of the Xbox Partner Preview showcase, and even though it was a pretty brief look at the game, it was still packed full of quite a few finer, hidden details. Here, we're going to look at a few that you may have missed.

As an annual franchise, Football Manager obviously doesn't make too many radical changes from year to year, and yet even so, it's one of very few franchises in its category that does tend to make meaningful – if small and iterative – changes with each new instalment. 

And though next year's game will see the series shaking things up quite drastically, in the here and now, Football Manager 2024 is very much sticking to the tradition of several iterative improvements coming together in impressive fashion. Here, we're going to talk about a few of those improvements.

Quantum Error puts players in the shoes of firefighter Captain Jacob Thomas as he responds to a research facility that seems to have caught on fire due to a mysterious attack. As Thomas delves deeper into the facility, things quickly start jumping off the rails, and he now has to fight off mysterious combatants with a single objective: no witnesses.

Unfortunately, Quantum Error feels like a much more ambitious game than the studio seemed capable of. The title’s combat feels incredibly generic, and often downright terrible thanks to the lack of real feedback on whether you’re even hitting enemies. There is also an emphasis on stealth, despite the game not really providing any tools to make sneaking around interesting. These gameplay issues, combined with a story that had the potential to be interesting if it had better characterization, voice acting, and direction, make Quantum Error a downright boring game.

With all the controversy around Call of Duty this year, mainly focused on Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard, it's easy to forget that a new game is out this year. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is a direct sequel to last year's game.

It's out on November 10th and sees Task Force 141 battling Vladimir Makarov. The game suffers from desaturated visuals, iffy netcode and awful spawns. Among all these reasons, check out why it may be worth ignorning this year's Call of Duty.
