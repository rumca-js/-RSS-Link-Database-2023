Researchers have found that languages around the world have words for 'this' and 'that'.  The 45-strong international team studied 29 languages from around the world including English, Spanish, Norwegian, Japanese, Mandarin, Tzeltal and Telugu. They wanted to see how more than 1,000 speakers use demonstratives -- words that show where something is in relation to a person talking such as 'this cat' or 'that dog'.

## Low-income countries could lose 30% of nutrients like protein and omega-3 from seafood due to climate change

The nutrients available from seafood could drop by 30 per cent for low-income countries by the end of the century due to climate change, suggests new research. That's in a high carbon emissions and low mitigation scenario, according to the study. This could be reduced to a roughly 10 per cent decline if the world were to meet the Paris Agreement targets of limiting global warming to 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius -- which recent reports have shown we're not on track to achieve.
