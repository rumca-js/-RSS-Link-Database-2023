<p>A UK-based software company called Threads Software Limited is threatening legal action against Meta over its use of the <a href="https://threads.cloud/press-release-threads-software-limited-gives-metas-instagram-30-days-to-desist-from-using-the-service-name-threads/"><ins>name Threads</ins></a>. The company, which says it’s owned the “Threads” trademark since 2012, makes an “intelligent message hub” that uses AI to help businesses keep track of phone calls, emails and other messages.</p>
<p>Threads Software Limited claims that Meta lawyers made four separate attempts, beginning in April 2023, to buy the software company’s threads.app domain, and eventually shut down its Facebook account. “Every offer was declined,” the company said in<a href="https://threads.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Threads-press-release-FINAL.pdf"><ins> a statement</ins></a>. “It was made clear to Meta’s Instagram that the domain was not for sale.

<p>NYU is <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/news/nyu-tandon-cuts-rug-new-3d-video-technology">launching a project</a> to spur the development of immersive 3D video for dance education — and perhaps other areas. Boosted by a $1.2 million four-year grant from the National Science Foundation, the undertaking will try to make Point-Cloud Video (PCV) tech viable for streaming.</p>
<p>A point cloud is a set of data points in a 3D space representing the surface of a subject or environment. NYU says Point-Cloud Video, which strings together point-cloud frames into a moving scene, has been under development for the last decade. However, it’s typically too data-intensive for practical purposes, requiring bandwidth far beyond the capabilities of today’s connected devices.</p>

<p>I am fully encased in a bundle of spider’s silk, only my eyeballs still visible as I wait for my turn to be devoured. I’ve failed to save the city from the insatiable arachnidian Old God, and now myself and all the inhabitants of Shiokawa, Japan are caught in its web. I’d come so far this time, solved all of the mysteries tacked to my bulletin board, but in the end, I couldn’t escape the doom that had been closing in on me.</p>
<p>If <a href="https://www.wohgame.com/"><em>World of Horror</em></a> could be reduced to a single word, it’d be “dread.” It's a point-and-click cosmic horror game created by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-20-world-of-horror-junji-ito-hp-lovecraft-hypercard-game.html">Polish developer and dentist, Pawel Kozminski</a> (also known as Panstasz). And after spending years in early access, Ysbryd Games finally released it to the public this month on Steam, PlayStation 4 and 5, and Nintendo Switch. It was well worth the wait.</p>

<p>X will no longer pay creators for tweets promoting misinformation. Elon Musk said the company is making a “slight change” to its monetization program and that tweets that are fact-checked via community notes will no longer be eligible for payouts as part of X’s revenue-sharing program.</p>
<p>The update appears to be an attempt to remove incentives for high-profile accounts to spread viral misinformation. “The idea is to maximize the incentive for accuracy over sensationalism,” Musk said.

<p>I've always dreamed of revisiting classic RPGs with my kids — I wanted them to jump across time with me in <em>Chrono Trigger</em>, or pretend to be sky pirates in <em>Skies of Arcadia. </em>It's not that tough to transform a well-told RPG into an interactive storybook for children (though I may have to shield their eyes from the more gruesome bits of <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>). I've been planning my &quot;intro to RPGs&quot; playlist for years, waiting for the moment my daughter Sophia began to look beyond the storytelling stylings of <em>Peppa Pig</em>.</p>
<p>But one night she saw me playing <em>Sea of Stars</em>, the recent <em>Chrono</em>-inspired retro RPG from Sabotage Studio, and she was hooked. I didn't need to entice her like I originally thought. The game's gorgeous 2D pixel art, catchy music (including some tunes from <em>Chrono Trigger</em> composer Yasunori Mitsuda) and epic story were more than enough to captivate her. While I held the Switch, she kept an eye out f

A broad grin crept across my mug as my Na'vi bounded from platform to platform up a mountain in the sky. The rousing music, lush vegetation and minimal user interface pulled me into Ubisoft's take on Pandora. Having ikran, the distant moon's answer to dragons, swooping around during my ascent helped me feel like I was actually exploring this alien environment.</p>
<p>The journey up to the ikran rookery was the highlight of my two hours or so with the game, closely followed by having the chance to explore Pandora from the skies after bonding with my new companion. Calling your new irkan flying friend to swoop in and rescue you in mid-air is thrilling, and your sidekick can land pretty much anywhere.</p>

<p>A basic smartphone used to cost upwards of $500, but those days are thankfully over. Now it’s possible to find something that meets most of your needs for as little as $160. However, navigating the budget phone market can be tricky. Many options that look good on paper often aren’t great in use, and some handsets will end up costing you more when you consider many come with restrictive storage. While we at Engadget spend most of our time testing and reviewing mid- to high-end handsets, we've tested a number of the latest budget-friendly phones on the market to see which are actually worth your money. This guide will help you find a bargain and maybe save you money as it highlights our top picks for the best cheap phones under $300 that you can get.</p>

<p>For this guide, our picks cost between $100 and $300. Anything less and you might as well go buy a dumb phone or high-end calculator instead. Since they’re meant to be more affordable th
