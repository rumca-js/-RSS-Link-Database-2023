This was the 12th year for the International, and the first show since 2017 to be held in Valve\u2019s home state of Washington. After two weekends\u2019 worth of qualifying matches, held at the Seattle Convention Center\u2019s Summit building, the top eight for this year\u2019s International was held Oct. 27-29.

Posts on LinkedIn and other platforms indicate that the layoffs impacted multiple departments at Bungie, including production, editorial, community management, talent acquisition, and social media. GeekWire reached out to Bungie for comment, and will update this story when we hear back. Bungie, the company behind Destiny 2 and the forthcoming Marathon revival, was acquired by Sony for $3.6 billion last year, which added Bungie to Sony\u2019s first-party network of PlayStation Studios.

Zulily&#8217;s PR representatives did not respond to an inquiry about the office, which is operated by Hudson Pacific Properties.
