There’s no more pernicious element in American life than the country’s practically irreformable constitution.

His writing, perhaps as a result, has the tender gaze of a sober artist looking back at his earlier life, and the lives of peers, with a clarity absent at the time.

They may counter that it was extremely similar to South Africa’s, who are second in the table having lost only once: both teams scheduled precisely 16 ODIs in the year before the start of the World Cup and none at all for five or six months until September, when they played a home series against Antipodean opponents, gave their first-team players a short break and then travelled to India.</p><p>The difference is that eight South Africans played 10 or more of those ODIs, and only four Englishmen, two of whom have been peripheral here. The majority of their side have played together frequently, and know the intricacies and idiosyncrasies of their teammates and this format.

The explosions, the gunfire from dozens of other soldiers around you, the sheer chaos and confusion. While other first-person shooters of the era usually put the player in full control of a single character taking on whole platoons of enemies singlehandedly, the original Call of Duty, which is 20 years old this week, dumped you into the middle of major onslaughts, surrounded by AI comrades. You weren’t Rambo, you were just a grunt, a cog in the second world war machine.</p><p>It wasn’t quite the first game to do this. The Medal of Honor titles from Electronic Arts were already dabbling in the whole idea of the epic battlefield shooter, but when the creative team behind the best instalment in that series Allied Assault, grew dissatified with life under EA

<p>There’s some inspired direction as Misery meets Ex Machina in this sci-fi psychological thriller </p><p>In what has the distinctively zoned-out vibe of another lockdown-born project, Natalie Kennedy’s sci-fi psychological thriller sees Clare Rivers (Rachel Shelley), an author with writer’s block, sign up for a deluxe writing retreat operated entirely by AI. Sealed hermetically into her unit by a virus that corrupts the system, she can’t leave until she has produced a book, making Blank play out like Misery and Ex Machina spliced.</p><p>Taking place in a near future where writing is all holographic word processors and genial AI assistants rather than tattered notebooks and half-eaten Twixes, the profession seems to have moved on. Or perhaps not: Clare’s blockage is aggravated by being locked in with only a malfunctioning amnesiac android called Rita (Heida Reed) for company.

<p>Documenting a collective walk from London to the Glasgow climate summit, Bemjamin Wigley’s film points up its spiritual heritage</p><p>Shot on a 16mm Bolex camera by film-maker Benjamin Wigley, who also captured the sound separately and recorded most of it on the hoof, this<strong> </strong>is an earnest but sincere hour-long film documenting a walk by climate activists from London to Glasgow in 2021. Organised by Extinction Rebellion Faith Bridge, the walk starts in Parliament Square and ends weeks later in Scotland, in time to coincide with the staging of Cop26, the UN climate change conference.</p><p>Organised by Christian clerical types – but inviting people of all faiths as well as those with no faith – there’s a strong spiritual vibe to the discourse Wigley captures on tape.

<p>Institute for Government thinktank publishes annual survey of public services, saying prisons, hospitals and adult social care are ‘particularly dire’</p><p>The <strong>Institute for Government</strong> report says one reason why public services in Britain are so poor is underinvestment. It says:</p><p>The UK has long invested less in its public services than other wealthy nations. Taking health as an example, since 1970 there have only been two years in which the UK did not spend below (often much below) the OECD average; today the NHS has half as many CT scanners per head of population as the OECD average. But even by these low standards, the decade before the pandemic saw particularly deep cuts to the capital spending of the departments overseeing the services covered in this report. The worst hit was the Ministry of Justice, where annual capital spending averaged less than half the real-terms spending in 2007/08.</p><p>Decades of underinvestment in capital has had a serious im

<p><strong>Sherman theatre, Cardiff<br /></strong>Manon Steffan Ros has translated Ionesco’s play into Welsh for this technically ambitious and compelling production </p><p>Eugène Ionesco’s absurdist classic warns that uncritical conformity leads to catastrophe, as one by one the residents of a small French town turn into horned rhinoceroses. Manon Steffan Ros’s Welsh-language adaptation transplants the action to a quiet Welsh village, and her programme note reminds us that the collective noun for a group of rhinoceroses is a crash. Both metaphorically and (muddily) literally, crashes come from all directions in Steffan Donnelly’s astute, lucid staging.</p><p>As Bérenger, the everyman who resists the transformation, Rhodri Meilir stands apart. Incongruently listless in a world that demands a little too much pep, his is a striking performance of understated physical delicacy, soft human sinews against the leathery roughness of animal skin.

<p>This troubling documentary reveals how migrants working as live-in hired help are exploited and abused by a system that gives total control to employers</p><p>Here is a harrowing investigation into modern-day servitude in Lebanon. Roser Corella’s documentary begins in a place of darkness: a black screen overlaid with an inquiring phone call placed to a domestic employment agency. Listing possible candidates according to their nationalities and pay rates, the conversation is shocking in its matter-of-fact callousness, as if the women were merely household appliances to be purchased and owned.</p><p>Lebanon’s <em>kafala</em> system, through which migrant labour is controlled, gives total control to employers, and domestic workers are completely unprotected by labour laws. The moment they arrive, the women have their passports taken away, which are then held by their host families; this is “advice” given by the agents themselves. Afraid of deportation, the workers endure gruelling ho

<p><strong>The Place, London</strong><br />The set is a claustrophobic flat, the clothes are baggy, the prop is a gaming console … this three-part show lets us peer into its characters’ lives </p><p>There’s something about seeing people on stage who don’t look like dancers; just boys, lads, with unkempt hair, baggy clothes and last night’s hangover, bonding over a gaming console. It’s rare in dance to find a setup that looks real, but Yorkshire-based Northern Rascals deal in slices of reality and everyday truths.</p><p>Shed is the latest piece from the young dance-theatre company, performed mostly inside a set that looks like someone’s flat, boxed in by walls and windows, the dancers’ restless, rubbery bodies buffeted around its small confines. It neatly places the characters in the world rather than the theatre, and allows the audience to peer into their lives. The set also serves as a screen for projections, often of the show’s poetic text (by company co-director Anna Holmes) spoke

<p>The People Just Do Nothing co-creator was raised on 90s hip-hop and can do a convincingly nasal Billie Joe Armstrong impression, but which saccharine soft-rock hit makes him blub?</p><p><strong>The first single I bought</strong><br />It’s Alright by East 17, from Woolworths in New Malden in south-west London, aged 11. In my mind, they were naughty young boys doing hardcore rap, even though really it was just pop music. So that was my introduction to rap.</p><p><strong>The song I do at karaoke</strong><br />I’ve been through lots of karaokes where all I do is an underground rap song and no one gives a shit and it ruins the whole vibe.

I learned every lyric and can do a really good impression where you just sound really nasal.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/oct/30/allan-mustafa-honest-playlist-kurupt-fm-people-just-do-nothing">Continue reading...</a>

Today the village houses the <a href="https://stanleyspencer.org.uk/">Stanley Spencer Gallery</a>, a converted Methodist chapel run entirely by volunteers.

Cathy immediately resigned from the party, which she joined three years ago when Starmer was elected leader. “This has been the last straw,” she tells me.

<p>Hearings for the government Covid inquiry resume today in Westminster with former Downing Street adviser Dominic Cummings slated to appear this week. Peter Walker reports on the story so far</p><p>The public inquiry into the UK’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic got under way earlier this year. So far it has heard from politicians such as David Cameron and George Osborne, who oversaw pandemic preparations and laid the conditions for the health service going into the crisis. It has heard from some of the scientists who advised the government and from the health secretary in office when the pandemic broke, Matt Hancock.</p><p>But as the Guardian’s deputy political editor, <strong>Peter Walker</strong>,<strong> </strong>tells <strong>Michael Safi</strong>, some of the most explosive moments have come not from witnesses themselves but from the mountain of material – much of it in the form of WhatsApp conversations – that they have handed over. In it, we can see the dark humour, petty

<p><strong>Minerva theatre, Chichester</strong><br />Despite fine acting, Harry Davies’ political thriller about a contaminated water scandal fails to plumb the depths of its characters</p><p>In two senses, this debut play by Harry Davies has a lot going on offstage. Previews were extended to allow the show, according to a theatre statement, “to reach its full potential”. And in writing about a public inquiry into a contaminated water scandal, Davies clearly alludes to the poisoned spa baths in Ibsen’s An Enemy of the People, but also follows the Norwegian’s practice of crucial events having occurred before the action. The Inquiry, though, stretches the technique by starting after both the scandal and the public hearings are over.</p><p>The play’s 100 minutes focus on the process of “Maxwellisation” that allows witnesses to challenge and redact criticisms before a report’s publication.
