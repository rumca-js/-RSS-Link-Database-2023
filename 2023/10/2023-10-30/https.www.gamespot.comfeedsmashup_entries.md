<p dir="ltr">Open-world games often benefit from putting players in the middle of wars and revolutions, fought across lush and fascinating worlds, where an evil force has taken control of nearly everything and must be pushed back inch by inch. Ubisoft often utilizes this formula for its open-world games, which usually feature huge and gorgeous worlds where you're fighting a powerful, entrenched military enemy. The harsh but beautiful alien moon of Pandora, the setting of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/avatar-the-way-of-water-review-dead-in-the-water/1900-6418013/">Avatar films</a>, is a near-perfect fit for the approach.</p><p dir="ltr">What's most interesting about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora/">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a>, though, is that it might give developer Massive Entertainment an opportunity to improve on the Ubisoft open-world formula at a time when the genre is inspiring more than a little fatigue.</p><p dir="ltr">

<p>Martin Scorsese is one of the most prolific and acclaimed filmmakers in movie history and has become a legend in his own time.

## David Fincher Pitched A Spider-Man Movie In 1999, Without The "Dumb" Origin

<p> </p><p dir="ltr">Before Spider-Man became one of the biggest box office draws of all time--now spanning three different decades--director David Fincher pitched his idea for the superhero in 1999. The filmmaker wanted to ignore Peter Parker's origin story, which meant those in charge "weren't f**king interested."</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/oct/27/david-fincher-on-hitmen-incels-and-spider-mans-dumb-origin-story?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other">The Guardian</a>, Fincher expressed how little he cares for Peter's beginnings while also understanding why he was rejected. "And I get it," he said. "They were like: 'Why would you want to eviscerate the origin story?' And I was like: 'Cos it's dumb?' That origin story means a lot of things to a lot of people, but I looked at it and I was like: 'A red and blue spider?' There’s a lot of things I can do in my life and that's just not one of them."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/david-finc
