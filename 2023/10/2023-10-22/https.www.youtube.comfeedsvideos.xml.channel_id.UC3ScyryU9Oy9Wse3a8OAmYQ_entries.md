Reporter Alexis Johnson takes you on a graphical visual journey through the history of voting for Black Americans: “What if I told you that the concerns we’re seeing over whose vote counts today, are just the latest chapter in a tale as old as America itself?” she asks. This FRONTLINE Short Doc goes inside the fight over the right to vote, explores how the roots of voter suppression trace back to post-Civil War America, and examines what’s happening now.
