<p>Is modern life making us ill – or are we just a little underslept?</p><p></p><p>Zonked, frazzled, drained, pooped, knackered, running on fumes – or just totally exhausted. In much the same way that the Shona-speaking people of Zimbabwe have a dozen verbs for walking, our modern vocabulary seems to have developed 20 ways of explaining that we are quite tired, most of the time. But is there anything about 21st-century life – our screen addictions, side-hustle culture or always-on mindsets – that means we are more tired, or are we just noticing it more? And when should you start to worry?</p><p>“The simple answer is that we need to distinguish between tiredness and fatigue,” says Prof Russell Foster, head of the Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute at the University of Oxford. “Tiredness is cured by getting enough sleep; fatigue is not, and is typically a marker of an underlying health condition. So if you’re getting enough sleep but waking up feeling chronically lethargic and

<p>Saturday came down to tiny margins. Unpicking England’s puzzle took the defending champions to the edge of reason</p><p>Paris was quiet on Sunday morning. The rain had stopped at last, and the wind, which had bent the trees and swept the leaves through the streets the previous evening, had died right down. The street cleaners were only just sweeping up the detritus of the night, ripped tickets, empty bottles, cigarette ends, cracked plastic glasses, and things that would be missed, hats, scarves, flags, even the odd dropped wallet. By noon it was all gone, the only evidence left were the bruises, headaches, and memories For one side the grim satisfaction of the win For the other, the lingering confusion of the defeat.</p><p>England’s fans weren’t left asking ‘what if?’ but ‘what the?’ It had been a strange game, almost impossible to take in at first viewing because while it felt for long stretches as though there was very little going on, it was in actual fact packed with telling

<p>A blurry image of open affection after England’s triumph in 1966 was a rare snapshot in a complicated relationship</p><p>There is a photograph taken seconds after the final whistle had blown in the 1966 World Cup final that shows Jack and Bobby Charlton kneeling in exhausted embrace. It was taken by Albert Cooper, one of the Sun’s northern sports photographers, who had been sent to Wembley for the game. Denied pitch access, perched on a plank at the back of a stand. Too far from the action and struggling with a 300mm f5.6 Novoflex lens and no tripod, he shot pretty much nothing of any value that day until, with fans jumping all around him and the makeshift platform wobbling, he captured the brothers in the moment of their greatest triumph.</p><p>It is not, by his own admission, the sharpest shot. A dark triangle – a shoulder? A flag? – covers the bottom left of the uncropped image, but that only adds to the sense of intimacy. For this is an extraordinary moment. There, amid 100,00

Small biting creatures that share our beds have created a raft of horror stories - but what really lies beneath the torrid tales?<p>Do you know how bedbugs mate? I’ll tell you. The male bug pierces the abdomen of the female before injecting her with sperm. Sometimes it kills her, which is not ideal from an evolutionary perspective, but still, they persist. It’s by no means the most violent or shocking mating practice (I think fairly often about male angler fish, who sink their teeth into the female, living as a parasite on her body until the two fuse, the male becoming completely absorbed leaving only his testes, which she keeps for when she’s ready to reproduce), but I think you’ll agree it’s up there. I’m thinking about bedbugs because, you see, I have just been to Paris. I returned to London to one question, asked regularly with a smirk and vague little fear. I knew, suddenly, how tall people must feel upon being asked repeatedly how the weather was up there. “Bring back any bedbu
