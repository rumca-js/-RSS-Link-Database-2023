Centering on themes of collapse, and dystopia juxtaposed with technological marvel, sci-fi subgenre cyberpunk has spawned numerous video game titles. Typical of this genre are evocative, futuristic environments, usually neon signed and raining, with a fight to dismantle higher powers and megacorporation. 

A whole host of other elements make up the genre – the perils of artificial intelligence, the morality of cybernetics, the lawless pushback of a city gripped in rampant capitalism, for instance – make cyberpunk one of the most well-known and most loved genres.
