<p>Layers of Fear developer Bloober Team has announced that a new free expansion, The Final Prologue, is coming to its first-person psychological horror game on October 24, a date that also commemorates the 15th anniversary of the studio.</p><p>The update will begin rolling out from 1 AM PT / 4 AM ET and will immerse players in the psyche of a famous movie director as he seeks to complete his ultimate masterpiece, even as the set around him descends into chaos.</p><p>This new story expands on the tale that was originally told in 2019's Layers of Fear 2, as that game revolved around an actor exploring a seemingly abandoned ship while following the directions of an unseen director. This time, the roles are reversed and players will direct the film's action as they work to complete a cinematic and horrifying film influenced by the actions of both inner demons and vile external forces.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-layers-of-fear-expansion-puts-you-in-the-directors-ch
