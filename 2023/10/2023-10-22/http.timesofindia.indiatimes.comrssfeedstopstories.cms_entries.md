The theory of a simulated universe suggests that our reality is a computer simulation, with physical laws being algorithms and our experiences being created by computational processes. Scientists and philosophers have shown interest in this theory despite its speculative nature. The concept has gained popularity in popular culture through movies like 'The Matrix.' The idea that reality is an illusion extends the principles of idealism and draws inspiration from advancements in computing and digital technology. Some scientists believe that there might be glitches or patterns in the fabric of the universe that could reveal its simulated nature. However, distinguishing between a simulated and non-simulated reality remains a challenge. A researcher has proposed a new law of physics called the "second law of infodynamics," which supports the simulated universe theory. This law explains why symmetry predominantly characterizes the universe and suggests that information entropy must remain
