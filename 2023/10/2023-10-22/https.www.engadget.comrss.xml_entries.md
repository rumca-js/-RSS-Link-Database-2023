<p>Instagram is testing a sticker creation feature that will let users make custom stickers from their own photos — and other users’, in some cases — and pop them into Reels or Stories.

<p>This month has been filled with conflicting rumors of an Apple product launch that either will or won’t happen, but <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-22/what-is-apple-doing-in-ai-revamping-siri-search-apple-music-and-other-apps-lo1ffr7p?srnd=undefined&amp;sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>’s Mark Gurman now says the October event is on, and it could bring a long overdue iMac upgrade. In the <em>Power On</em> newsletter, Gurman reports that sources close to Apple said a Mac launch is in the works for this month.

The task of taking a NASA mission from development and funding through construction and launch — all before we even use the thing for science — can span decades. Entire careers have been spent putting a single satellite into space. Nobel-winning NASA physicist John Mather, mind you, has already helped send up two.</p>
