Developer Stairway Games has announced its tropical island farming sim Coral Island will be getting its 1.0 release on 14th November after just over a year of PC early access, and it'll be launching for Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 on the same day.
</p><p>
Coral Island, which entered early access last October on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1158160/Coral_Island/">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gd/p/coral-island-game-preview/9n1t1mq92pvs?activetab=pivot:overviewtab">Microsoft Store</a>, is yet another entry in the ever-growing list of farming sims heavily inspired by Stardew Valley's more modern take on the genre (it even has an evil corporate entity of its own), but it's aiming to set itself apart with a focus on ocean exploration and conservation.

Blizzard has announced a last-minute (but hopefully brief) delay for Diablo 4's Season of Blood, explaining it "encountered some complications" ahead of today's release.
</p><p>
Diablo 4's Season of Blood - its second season of post-launch content since arriving in June - promises the likes of a new vampire hunter quest line, 22 new vampiric powers, new monster types and variants, plus a new seasonal event.
</p><p>
It was initially expected to arrived at 6pm BST/10am PDT, but Blizzard announced it was slamming on the brakes ten minutes after Season of Blood was due to release.

Paradox Interactive has announced it is parting ways with BattleTech developer Harebrained Schemes, citing "strategic and creative priorities". The seperation follows last week's news that Harebrained Schemes' The Lamplighters League has been a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-declares-pulp-strategy-the-lamplighters-league-a-22m-flop">$22m flop</a> for Paradox.

If you're super-excited for the release of Alan Wake 2 later this month, but can't quite recall the events of the first game (entirely reasonably seeing as the original version came out over a decade ago), Fortnite of all places might have the answer. Epic has whacked a free playable 20-minute Alan Wake recap episode that should serve as a refresher while offering a bit of spooky battery gobbling fun along the way.
</p><p>
Alan's first adventure, released all the way back in 2010, sees the eponymous writer taking a working holiday with his wife, Alice, in the beautiful Pacific Northwest town of Bright Falls. Needless to say, it doesn't take long for things to go awry, and, soon, Alan - with occasional help from his agent BARRY - is monologuing his way through the night, blasting malevolent beings to smithereens with his torch and

Exactly 364 after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-new-mortal-kombat-role-playing-game-coming">its announcement</a>, Mortal Kombat: Onslaught - NetherRealm's free-to-play character-collecting RPG - is out of beta testing and available to download on iOS and Android.
</p><p>
Mortal Kombat: Onslaught's big selling point is its "mobile-exclusive" story - promising "high quality graphics, cinematic cutscenes, and bone-krushing kombat" - that'll see players joining forces with Raiden in a bid to prevent fallen Elder God Shinnok from gathering relics and regaining his evil powers. All that plays out through "massive real-time group battles", featuring up to ten fighters at once, that'll require players to tailor their team of four champions to take on specific opponents and challenges.

"It's always fun to come back and think of the 'what-ifs', and the chance to work on this game is an exploration of one of the what-ifs, isn't it?" Rhys-Davies said of his inclusion in the game.

These minor changes come thanks to manufacturing improvements and more generous binning, but are they enough to break the deadlock and give Intel the fastest gaming CPU title once more? We've received the 14900K and 14600K to find out, as we put Intel's latest against our usual barrage of game benchmarks and content creation workloads. </p><p>It'll be a tough challenge even with (modestly) higher clocks, as AMD's Ryzen 7000 CPUs are capable from the top to the bottom of the stack while often drawing less power too.

Respectable platforming and classic Sonic elements are undermined by inconsistent new ideas.
</p><p>
Collecting Chaos Emeralds in Sonic games as a child always felt special. I have fond memories of leaping over falling spiky logs to discover a shimmering gem behind a waterfall in Sonic on the Master System, my first Sonic love. Then there was corkscrewing down a tunnel in Sonic 2 and collecting blue orbs in Sonic and Knuckles, that squelching sound imprinted on my brain. Chaos Emeralds were an achievement for only the most dedicated Sonic players. 
</p><p>
Not so with Sonic Superstars, the latest from Sega. That's because each jewel is paired with a special ability like summoning duplicate characters, or swimming up waterfalls, or revealing hidden platforms. These abilities could have added depth to gameplay, but t

Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is a mere few days away from release and the reviews and impressions have started rolling in across the web (no pun intended, but isn't it nice when it just happens). Many have praised the game's action, slick traversal and story, but one area that has been highlighted away from your typical professional assessment is the puddles. 
</p><p>Some players felt the first Spider-Man game was lacking in the puddle density department, noting the game's E3 2017 gameplay trailer had larger and better defined puddles than in the released version. This caused quite a stir on social media and was eventually dubbed "puddlegate".</p><p>

A video purporting to show an unused post-credits scene found within the files of Assassin's Creed Mirage may point to a seismic upcoming shift in series' story.
</p><p>
Filenames for the scene reference "Assassin's Creed Neo", an internal Ubisoft codename believed to refer to one of several upcoming projects currently in development. Thus, the big twist revealed here is expected to be something we see more of in future games.

For those who'd rather be left unspoiled, this is your last chance to turn away now.

All I remember are the doughy faces of the Moomins, with their big eyes and cuddly bodies. I don't remember Snufkin. Was he always a thorn in society's side? Because he is here, in the new game, in Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley.
