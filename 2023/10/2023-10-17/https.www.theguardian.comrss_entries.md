Paul Mbong gave the underdogs Malta a shock lead with only their second goal of the European Championship qualifying campaign. But an own goal from Ryan Camenzuli hauled Ukraine level before Artem Dovbyk’s penalty and a late strike from Chelsea’s Mykhailo Mudryk secured a 3-1 victory.</p><p>This result combined with another 3-1 win, for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/17/england-italy-euro-2024-qualifying-match-report">England against Italy at Wembley</a>, meant Ukraine were able to open up a three-point gap over their rivals for second place.

<p>This rage-fuelled chronicle of mismanagement, corruption and greed – featuring the likes of Michael Gove – will leave you incredulous. It is fine, anger-powered work</p><p>Britain’s Housing Crisis is powered by rage. It is a long time since I have seen a documentary so nakedly angry, so clear in its point of view and unabashed about standing by it. Which is not to say it is unbalanced. The makers’ fury has made it meticulous in the use of governmental and other sources to explain policies – along with the thinking behind decisions whose detrimental effects are predicted and attested to by activists and workers from charities such as Shelter. If the subject were not people being made homeless by underinvestment in social housing and mismanagement of the property market by successive governments, plus the greed and corruption of some housebuilders, you would be tempted to buy popcorn and settle down to enjoy the cathartic rush.</p><p>As it is, the two-part film will have you nodding

<p>Midfielder’s dazzling creativity dovetailed with the industry around him and brought a feelgood factor to Wembley</p><p>The “Bellingham burst” has a certain ring to it. With almost half an hour played Wembley had shown its first signs of descending into an unnervingly familiar tetchiness, a groundswell of dissatisfaction brewing as England’s defenders passed the ball in front of a static midfield. Italy had begun as if resigned to be bullied but now, a goal up and with palpable wind in their sails, they appeared to have Gareth Southgate’s players where they wanted them. This <em>Azzurri</em> side are a pale imitation of many that have gone before but they had lured their hosts into the kind of slow, vacant buildup from which little good usually comes.</p><p>Fortunately for England, Jude Bellingham’s involvement brings with it near-guaranteed excellence.

Almost as if there is a disconnect in government. Our eyes are inevitably focused on Israel and Gaza. Processing the horrors past and horrors present of the last 10 days and hoping there are not worse to come.</p><p>Rishi Sunak looks terrified. Anxious to make a difference but not sure how. Going through the motions, trying to say the right thing. To reassure himself as much as the rest of the country.

<p>The bassist suffered in silence with a panic disorder and alcohol problems took him to the brink of death. He explains how he turned his life around</p><p>If Guns N’ Roses frontman Axl Rose upholds the band’s sense of chaos, and lead guitarist Slash is behind its flair, bass player Duff McKagan brings the attitude. He was born in Seattle and his musical roots are indebted to punk from both sides of the Atlantic; this summer, GNR have covered the Stooges’ TV Eye on tour, McKagan snarling through Iggy Pop’s vocal parts as all six-foot-plus of his wiry, tattoo-covered frame bounds around.</p><p>McKagan’s recent solo music channels the same outlaw spirit, but instead through acoustic twangs and a weathered voice – a lively meeting of reflective Americana and sonorous rock’n’roll. Lighthouse, his third solo album in 30 years, comprises 10 songs carefully selected from a batch of 60 recorded during the Covid-19 pandemic, and that title holds multiple meanings. “I have an amazing wife –

At first, they look like a mass of meaningless patterns, but if you squint and relax your brain, you may perceive a dolphin or a palm tree or something like that. Similarly The Caller is an illusion – in that if you relax your brain, it’s kind of like you’re watching a horror movie – but it’s also really not the real deal, despite notionally having all the elements.</p><p>The premise, sketched in briefly, is legitimate enough: a young woman working from home as a call centre operative is terrorised by a caller (Eric Roberts) with a creepy voice, who eventually shows up at her isolated location, pops on a Purge-style mask and attacks. Unfortunately, it’s clear from minute one that the film-makers had a budget of approximately 10 pence to work with.

Giggling away with a drink and a packet of crisps, I often wonder if I am its only disloyal subject. Surely not? For a long time I couldn’t really believe anyone took it seriously and assumed it must be in on the joke of itself – a Nicolas Cage of a show, if you will.</p><p>I can’t quite decide whether this position has been bolstered or undermined by the high-camp news that the forthcoming final series is to f

<p>The Discworld creator’s short tales from the 70s and 80s reveal a young talent bursting with invention and wit</p><p>When Terry Pratchett’s first Discworld novel appeared, it was a revelation. Just as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/douglasadams">Douglas Adams</a> shifted the foundations of sci-fi, Pratchett rejuvenated fantasy. Fantasy can boast world-beating authors, but hungry readers have also had to suffer portentous tales of men with swords declaiming at one another across prose that takes half a page to say: “Yeah, but are you a werewolf, though?” – or, indeed: “Hello.” Pratchett was and remains the opposite of that.</p><p>Like Adams, Pratchett knows what his point is and gets to it. True to his journalistic roots, he picks a great title and cracks on. His prose is light-footed, melodious, conversational and deceptively deep. His plotlines are inventive, generous and even offer fully formed female characters. Underlying his work is a characteristic sense that any

<p>In a country where historic buildings appear around almost every corner, these lesser-known treasures offer brilliant visits without the crowds</p><p>The Rock of Cashel, a medieval stronghold that once served as the seat of Ireland’s kings, is undeniably magnificent. Perched high on an outcrop overlooking lush Tipperary farmland, its round towers, high crosses and 13th-century Gothic cathedral attract a steady stream of visitors. But it’s not the only Irish castle or abbey to draw large crowds. Even off season, there are long queues for internationally recognised sites such as Bunratty, Clonmacnoise, Glendalough, Dunluce, Blarney and Kylemore. Unesco-designated world heritage site Skellig Michael (famous as Luke Skywalker’s island sanctuary in Star Wars) has limited access, and other ancient buildings have been made into five-star hotels.</p><p>But this is a country where a castle or abbey can appear around almost every windswept corner, so there are thousands of off-the-radar pla

<p>Despite a fairly predictable story, first-time director Steven Pierce makes some interesting tweaks to the formula with a final act that confounds expectations</p><p>Like every zombie-themed movie ever, this low-budget American feature directed by debutant Steven Pierce (co-written by Pierce and James Allerdyce) has a subtext; this one so close to the surface it’s barely sub, about schisms that divide communities. Quite often, the factions in zombie stories cleave along class lines or ethnicity. But Herd mixes the formula up in a number of interesting ways; for starters, by casting as the heroines lesbian spouses Jamie (Ellen Adair) and Alex (Mitzi Akaha), city dwellers on a camping trip trying to heal marital wounds after the loss of a child.</p><p>Thus the women are already semi-outsiders in rural Missouri where they’re visiting, although it’s near where Jamie grew up. Not that this puts her more at ease, given an abusive childhood growing up with her father, Robert, (Corbin Ber

<p>Despite Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, in the Barents Sea it maintains cordial relations with Nato neighbours over fishing rights – barely</p><p>From the village of Grense Jakobselv, where the Norwegian-Russian border meets the Arctic Ocean, you can see straight into Russia. And, across the river that marks the border line, the Russian soldiers can look right back.</p><p>Despite water temperatures here rarely climbing above 10C (50F), in the summer months the Norwegian side is a popular destination for fishing, beluga whale spotting, basking in the midnight sun and, since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, peering into Russia. “Everyone wants to go to one of the most eastern military points of Norway and have a look into Russia. It’s like being at Loch Ness,” says Trygg Arne Larsen, a military adviser.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/17/barents-sea-life-on-the-eu-only-open-border-with-russia">Continue reading...</a>

<p>One day, my hand stopped speaking to my brain. As a doctor and flute player, I had to try to understand this strange affliction</p><p>The morning after performing the concert of my life, I could no longer play the flute. The pinky and ring fingers of my left hand failed to cooperate with what my mind wanted to do – I couldn’t work the keys. The harder I tried, the more my fingers curled into a claw, stuck in spasm. Even stranger: no other activity was affected. I could type on a keyboard with the same facility as usual and play scales on the piano with unimpeded finger action.</p><p>The concert, the capstone of my master’s degree in historical performance at the same university where I’d worked as a palliative care physician until 2019, was in March 2020 – one of the last before the Covid-19 lockdowns. My weird finger problem seemed small compared with the unfolding pandemic.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/oct/17/focal-dystonia-my-hand-spasmed-and-shook-why-mu

<p>The Scottish National party has agreed a new strategy for pursuing independence at its annual conference. But is declining support for the party placing the issue out of reach? Libby Brooks reports from Aberdeen</p><p>It’s been a torrid past few months for the Scottish National party (SNP). Its former leader, Nicola Sturgeon, was arrested (and released without charge) by police investigating allegations of financial misconduct. Meanwhile, the party’s new leader, Humza Yousaf, has been trying to steady the ship amid fractious policy disputes and more recently the huge defeat to Labour at the Rutherglen and Hamilton West byelection. Just before the SNP’s annual conference began, one of its MPs defected to the Conservative party.</p><p><strong>Libby Brooks</strong> has been with the party faithful as the SNP gathers in Aberdeen, where the centrepiece of the event was setting a new course for independence.

<p>NGO leaders and technical experts who helped secure western aid for official shift to clean energy are being locked up now that they are no longer needed</p><p>Less than 12 months ago G7 countries agreed to provide billions of dollars to help Vietnam ditch coal. The funding was described as a “<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/international-agreement-to-support-vietnams-ambitious-climate-and-energy-goals">gamechanger</a> in the fight against climate change” by Rishi Sunak, the British prime minister. It was designed to help Vietnam achieve a “just and equitable” energy transition, with input from civil society.</p><p>But in the months that have followed, Vietnam has continued a crackdown on environmentalists, jailing NGO leaders and technical experts who specialise in clean energy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/17/they-challenged-the-communist-monopoly-vietnam-regime-turns-on-its-climate-champions">Continue reading...</a>
