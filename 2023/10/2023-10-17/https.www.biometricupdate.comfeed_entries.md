		At the <a href="https://authenticatecon.com/event/authenticate-2023/">2023 Authenticate</a> conference in Carlsbad, California, a trio of speakers from the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/fido-alliance">FIDO Alliance</a> reflected on the current status of its biometrics requirements and certification program, and offered a preview of new certification for face verification for remote identity verification (rIDV) and identity proofing launching in November.

In a presentation titled “FIDO’s Biometric Journey,” <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202301/ieee-recognizes-stephanie-schuckers-biometrics-contributions-with-fellowship">Stephanie Schuckers</a> and Greg Cannon from FIDO’s Biometrics Working Group joined Anthony Lam from i

		The rollout of the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) is now expected to roll out in May 2025, BTN Europe <a href="https://www.businesstravelnewseurope.com/Management/EU-s-ETIAS-travel-system-set-for-further-delay">reports</a>, citing Schengen Visa Info. However,  the latest delay has not been confirmed by the European Commission.

The delay of ETIAS, officials say, is linked to delays in the full operationalization of the EU Entry-Exit system, which seeks to ensure EU member countries make greater use of biometric technologies in the management of their borders. Technical problems have also been blamed for the situation.

An unnamed EU official is quoted as saying that they had hoped to get ETIAS working by the end of this year, or the

		Biometric consent legislation is being considered by lawmakers in the rural U.S. state of Maine.

A pair of bills, neither of which will be voted up or down until next year, would give state residents more ownership of personal data, including biometric identifiers.

Both would fall under the state's Unfair Trade Practices Act. Legislators in both state houses would have to consolidate their bills before sending it to the governor for signing.

One of them, <a href="https://legislature.maine.gov/bills/display_ps.asp?PID=1456&amp;snum=131&amp;paper=HP1094">LD 1705</a>, would require express, written consent of a person before their biometrics could be collected.

		Age estimation with biometrics remains a viable option for keeping children in the U.S. state of Utah from accessing online content some parents wish did not exist. Verification still appears to be the process lawmakers prefer.

One of the nation's most religiously conservative states, Utah this year passed legislation that makes firms responsible for rebuffing access to some online content by minors.

Officials now have approved <a href="https://socialmedia.utah.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Social-Media-Regulation-Act-Proposed-Rule.pdf">regulations</a> for companies to follow as the Social Media Regulation Act. <a href="https://utconcierge.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0PduJX8UWiH2zbM?Source=Web">Comments</a> are being collected by the state prior to the

According to a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/china-proposes-blacklist-sources-used-train-generative-ai-models-2023-10-12/">report</a> by Reuters, the draft requirements would see any body of data assessed to have more than 5 percent of said undesirable content blacklisted from being used to train public-facin

		A new report from a British think-tank suggests that African governments are investing heavily in biometrics for surveillance but appears to be confused about the applications it refers to.

The Institute of Development Studies looked into internet interception, mobile signal interception, social media surveillance, safe city technologies for monitoring public spaces, and biometrics.

		Taiwan’s government must go back to the drawing board to address the weaknesses in its digital identity scheme highlighted by a court ruling against it earlier this year, say a team of lawyers.

Implementing a planned digital ID scheme in Taiwan without citizen consensus and the enactment of special data protection laws could give room for human rights violations and data breaches, a Taiwanese court ruled in May.

The ruling has received approbation from three counsels who represented a group of citizens in the lawsuit against government. The lawyers shared their thoughts on the court verdict in <a href="https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=3f3a21f4-d7ba-4ba9-8df6-522a180812d7">an article</a> published this week by legal publication Lexology.

		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/anonybit">Anonybit</a> has raised $3 million and says it plans to accelerate its delivery of privacy-by-design identity management technologies to enterprises. Those technologies make use of a patent-pending method of distributed storage for biometrics and other sensitive data to combat data breaches and account takeover attacks.

The funding round was led by Jam Fintop, with participation from Connecticut Innovations, and brings Anonybit to $8 million raised in total so far. The company announced <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202201/anonybit-raises-3-5m-to-relieve-biometrics-providers-of-sensitive-data-storage">$3.5 million in funding</a> at the beginning of 2022 that <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ano

		Recently reported difficulties by some users in accessing digital certificates linked to the My Number digital ID in some municipalities in Japan is the latest episode in a series of complaints as the government races to fix a panoply of problems related to the system.

The failure to access digital certificates linked to the digital IDs occurred on October 10, but the issues were immediately resolved by the competent authorities, per a <a href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20231011/k10014221921000.html">report</a> by News Web.

According to the Organization for Local Government Information Systems, the body overseeing the ID system, about 10 municipalities in different parts of the country witnessed system failures as users were unable to renew their digital
