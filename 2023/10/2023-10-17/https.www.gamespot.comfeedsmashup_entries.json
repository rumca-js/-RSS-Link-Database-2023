There are five games leaving the service on October 31, following the six that were axed from Game Pass on October 15.</p><p>Titles getting dropped from Game Pass on October 31 include Gunfire Reborn, Kill It With Fire, Persona 5 Royal, Signalis, and Solasta Crown of the Magister. Persona 5 Royal and Signalis were added to Game Pass in October 2022, so there is a possibility that Microsoft had a one-year deal for these titles.</p><p>Game Pass isn't just losing games in October, though. Like A Dragon: Ishin comes to the service today, October 17, while F1 Manager 2023 lands on October 19. Day-one launches like Cities: Skylines II and Headbangers: Rhythm Royale are also coming this month.

But over the last decade, the franchise has become just as synonymous for its Hollywood-caliber cutscenes and epic storytelling, and that's exactly what Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, NetherRealm Studios' new mobile game, hopes to capture in its gameplay.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">That's a tall order considering the grandiose scale of its cinematics, often displaying over-the-top battles of dozens of characters taking on larger-than-life villains--even the mainline games' usual 1v1 fights rarely capture the same Hollywood blockbuster spirit. But Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, a real-time, squad-based mobile RPG, sets out to replicate that sense of scale in the palm of your hands.
