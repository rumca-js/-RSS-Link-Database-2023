<p>We still have months to wait before <em>Dune: Part Two </em>hits theaters, so what better time to reminisce about David Lynch's intriguing adaptation of Frank Herbert's masterpiece? Reviled at the time, Lynch's <em>Dune </em>has now firmly established itself as a cult sci-fi epic, a film with boundless creative energy hampered by studio interference.</p>
<p>In this bonus episode, Devindra chats with film journalist <a href="https://www.maxevry.com/">Max Evry</a>, author of <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL01hc3RlcnBpZWNlLURpc2FycmF5LURhdmlkLUx5bmNocy1IaXN0b3J5L2RwLzE5NDgyMjEyOTI_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tNHRsLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI5YTcwMTk5Yy02OWFjLTQxZDktYTNkMC01NmI4NzNkMTM4NWQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAA

<p>On Tuesday, Microsoft <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/10/17/xbox-new-accessibility-updates/">announced</a> a slew of accessibility updates for Xbox players on consoles and PCs. These include keyboard key remapping using controllers, easier-to-get-to accessibility shortcuts and a new section in the Microsoft Store. In a reminder that inclusive design can help everyone, one of the new features will let anyone set up a new controller without getting up to press a pair button on the console.</p>
<p>Wireless controller pairing no longer requires direct console contact. “From the comfort of a couch, wheelchair, hospital bed, etc., players can now put their console into pairing mode using an Xbox media remote, digital assistant voice command, or previously paired controller to connect a new controller to their console,” the company wrote today in a blog post.

<p>Austrian Audio is not exactly a household name. It was formed in 2017 following the closure of AKG's offices in Vienna. And it's mostly stuck to higher-end microphones and headphones. Now the company is dipping its toes into more consumer-friendly territory with the $199 <a href="https://austrian.audio/micreator/">MiCreator Studio</a>, a combination condenser microphone and USB-C <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-audio-interfaces-130019808.html">audio interface</a> in an incredibly portable package.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At 155 x 60 x 37 mm the MiCreator Studio is quite small, but I'd say a touch shy of pocketable. It's also surprisingly dense. 13 ounces isn't exactly heavy, but it's more than I expected the MiCreator to weigh just by looking at it. The heft makes it feel like a durable and well-made device. The only exception to this is the swappable faceplates. My review sample came with black and red plates, they look nice but feel a little flimsy. And the magnets that attach them

<p>Google has <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/accessibility/making-daily-tasks-accessible/"><ins>revealed</ins></a> a string of accessibility updates it's rolling out for Maps, Search and Assistant, as well as greater availability of some camera-based Pixel features. One of the main focus areas this time around is wheelchair accessibility. A new option that's gradually becoming available on iOS and Android will allow Maps users to request stair-free walking routes. This feature — which Google says will benefit those traveling with luggage and strollers as well — will be available globally, as long as the company has sufficient data for the region.</p>
<p>Google notes that if you have the wheelchair-accessible option enabled in your transit preferences, this will automatically be applied to walking routes too. Otherwise, when you request a walking route, you can access stair-free directions by tapping the three dots at the top of the screen and enabling the &quot;whe

<p>YouTube’s rolling out a <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-new-features-2023/"><ins>whole bunch of new features and design updates,</ins></a> three dozen in total. Some of these tools are for the web app, while others are for the smartphone app and smart TV software. These features aren’t game-changers by themselves, but they add up to an improved user experience. Let’s go over some of the more interesting ones.</p>
<p>It’s now easier to speed up videos for those who just can’t get enough of really fast podcast clips. Just hold your finger down on the video and it’ll automatically bump up the playback speed to 2x. This feature is also useful for searching through a video for a relevant portion, in addition to fast-paced playback. The tool’s available across web, tablets and mobile devices.</p>

<p>If you have a pair of in-ear headphones, there’s a good chance they are using a technology that’s <a href="https://www.soundstagesolo.com/index.php/features/258-balanced-armatures-why-you-might-or-might-not-want-them"><ins>several</ins></a> decades <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrodynamic_speaker_driver"><ins>old</ins></a>. Despite attempts to introduce different, exotic-sounding systems like planar magnetic, electrostatic and even bone conduction, most IEMs or in-ear headphones still use either balanced armature or dynamic drivers. But there’s another contender, promising high fidelity, low power consumption and a tiny physical footprint. The twist is, it’s a technology that’s been in your pocket for the last ten years already.</p>
<p>We’re talking about micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), and it’s a technology that’s been used in almost every microphone in every cell phone since the 2010s. When applied to headphone drivers (the inverse of a microphone) the benef

<p>During his keynote address, Li demonstrated improvements to those four core capabilities on-stage by having the AI create a multimodal car commercial in a few minutes based on a short text prompt , solve complex geometry problems and progressively iterate the plot for a short story on the spot.

<p>The game within a game appears to provide a quick recap of the events of the first title within <em>Fortnite</em>. “Troubled author Alan Wake embarks on a desperate search for his missing wife, Alice,” Epic’s description reads. “Following her mysterious disappearance from the Pacific Northwest town of Bright Falls, he discovers pages of a horror story he has supposedly written, but has no memory of.”</p>

<p>If you’re a fan of playing video games and meeting new people, streaming is a fantastic activity to get in on, but it’s also fairly technical. It’s not just about having the latest consoles or PC gear, either. The most successful streams offer crisp audio, dynamic lighting and clear video, on top of smooth gameplay and a steady drip of irresistible charm (though, that last one isn’t for sale at any store). YouTube and Twitch streamers have specific, high-tech needs, and you don’t have to look far to find a gadget that’ll make playing games on these platforms easier — or even just a little more colorful. Here’s some of our favorite gear for going live with a good game and a few (hundred? thousand?) friends.</p>

The Meta-owned chat application has launched passkey support for Android, which means users no longer have to use OTPs from two-factor authentication to be able to log into their account. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/passkeys-passwords-authentication-security-133024414.html?_fsig=VYtXT4n3oeuJQRJ6AkKQkw--%7EA">Passkeys</a> are a relatively new login technology designed to be resistant to phishing attacks, password leaks and other security vulnerabilities plaguing its older peers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They're made up of cryptographic pairs consisting of one public key and one private key that lives on the user's device. Services that support passkeys don't have access to that private key, and it also can't be written down or given away. Without that private key, nobody else can log into somebody's account. Now that WhatsApp has launched passkey support, users can log in using their device's au

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/volta-zero-electric-truck-city-deliveries-123339497.html">Volta Trucks</a> has declared bankruptcy in Sweden after four years in business. The <a href="https://voltatrucks.com/press/statement-from-the-board-of-volta-trucks">EV manufacturers' board announced the news in a statement</a> that thanked its workers and pointed to its existing accomplishments and unattained potential. &quot;We created the world's first purpose-built 16-tonne all-electric truck, including a unique cab and chassis design, that would have contributed to decarbonising the environment and enhanced the health and safety and air quality of urban centres.&quot; The company had piloted its delivery vehicle, Volta Zero, in five European countries and originally <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volta-electric-delivery-truck-us-release-date-160132320.html">planned to expand to Los Angeles</a> in mid-2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Volta Trucks blames its situation, in part, on that of another b

<p>Myspace is getting the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nostalgia-alert-theres-a-documentary-about-myspace-in-the-works-183359176.html">documentary treatment</a>, with a film currently in the works chronicling the rise and fall of arguably the first big social network. When it launched in 2003, you chose your top eight digital friends, and drama ensued. The platform went mainstream, becoming an important music promotional tool long before Bandcamp or even YouTube.</p>
<p>The movie will be a joint project between production companies Gunpowder &amp; Sky and The Documentary Group. Gunpowder &amp; Sky has produced documentaries like <em>69: The Saga of Danny Hernandez </em>and<em> Everybody’s Everything</em>, about deceased rapper Lil Peep. The Documentary Group’s behind shows like <em>Amend: The Fight for America</em> and <em>The Deep End</em>, a series focusing on spiritual wellness guru Teal Swan.</p>
<p>Maybe, just maybe, we’ll even learn what Tom from Myspace's last name is.</p

<p>Snapchat has rolled out two new features, including the ability to <a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/how-to-embed-snapchat-content">embed content from the platform into a website</a>. Users can now embed Lenses, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-is-bringing-ads-to-spotlight-and-my-ai-170011190.html">Spotlight videos</a> and public stories or profiles through their computer browser by clicking the embed button under share options. This will automatically copy the code — just as competitors like Instagram and TikTok have long allowed users to do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following years of trying to broaden from just a platform to send pictures back and forth with friends, the option to embed is a logical next step from Snapchat. It builds on other features like articles and discovering local places of interest and, in 2022, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-for-web-is-now-available-for-everyone-130052210.html">Snapchat for Web</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Disney its turning <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-remastering-garogyles-155559137.html"><em>Gargoyles</em></a>, its animated cult classic from the 90s, into a live-action TV series for its streaming service. It's also teaming up with two of the most well-known names in horror films today to make it happen. According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/gargoyles-live-action-tv-show-reboot-1235342849/"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a>, James Wan's Atomic Monster production company and Gary Dauberman are in the early stages of developing a live-action <em>Gargoyles</em> for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-is-raising-prices-and-cracking-down-on-account-sharing-001637934.html">Disney+</a>. You may know James Wan as the creator of The Conjuring franchise and as co-creator of the Saw and Insidious franchises, in addition to directing <em>Aquaman</em>. Dauberman, a frequent Wan collaborator who had written the <em>Annabelle</em> movies, will serv

<p>Much like how Huawei developed its own <a href="https://www.engadget.com/huawei-harmonyos-2-android-alternative-rollout-matepad-watch-3-165221411.html">HarmonyOS</a> as an Android substitute, Xiaomi is about to pull a similar move to bolster its ecosystem — especially with its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xiaomi-ev-factory-beijing-150108230.html?src=rss">electric car</a> due to arrive in the first of half next year. Dubbed &quot;HyperOS,&quot; this <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-08-16-xiaomi-m1-with-miui-os-a-310-phone-with-1-5ghz-dual-core-soc-a.html">MIUI</a> replacement will apparently be a blend of Android and Xiaomi's very own &quot;Vela&quot; system, hence a &quot;completely rewritten underlying architecture&quot; that would supposedly allow users, vehicles and smart home — of over 200 product categories — to connect with one another seamlessly. It's safe to assume that Xiaomi's electric car will also feature HyperOS, thus going head to head with Huawei's <a hre

<p>Half of Bandcamp's employees have lost their jobs following the company's acquisition by Songtradr, according to <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/tech/article/bandcamp-layoffs-oakland-songtradr-epic-18429463.php"><em>SFGate</em></a> and <a href="https://variety.com/2023/music/news/bandcamps-layoffs-songtradr-1235758123/"><em>Variety</em></a>. Songtradr spokesperson Lindsay Nahmiache has admitted to <em>SFGate</em> that only 58 of Bandcamp's 118 employees received an offer during the transition. A remaining employee has confirmed Nahmiache's statement to the publication, reporting that half of the company has disappeared from its Slack chatroom and that the account owned by co-founder and former CEO Ethan Diamond has been deactivated. Some former employees who didn't receive offers have taken to social networks to reveal that they had been kept in the dark and <a href="https://twitter.com/modernistwitch/status/1713956664636793288">were in limbo</a> over the past couple of weeks.&nbs

<p>A lot has changed in the two years since Facebook released its Ray Ban-branded smart glasses. Facebook is now called Meta. And its smart glasses also have a new name: the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. Two years ago, I <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ray-ban-stories-hands-on-160048150.html">was unsure</a> exactly how I felt about the product. The Ray-Ban Stories were the most polished smart glasses I’d tried, but with mediocre camera quality, they felt like more of a novelty than something most people could use.&nbsp;</p>
