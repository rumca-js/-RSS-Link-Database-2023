  <p id="FbbRWq">It’s not often that a hardware product comes along and overhauls and improves how I work on a daily basis. Elgato’s new Prompter has done exactly that in the few days I’ve been using it, offering up an all-in-one teleprompter and additional monitor that can be used with a Mac or PC for $279.99. If you’ve ever wanted to have eye contact with people on Zoom calls, talk directly to your Twitch chat, or easily read a script for a presentation or YouTube video, then this is for you. </p>

  <p id="ngvSSY">“Like and subscribe” is a familiar mantra to anyone who regularly watches videos on YouTube. But with some new changes YouTube is rolling out to the video streaming platform, the words will do more than just annoy you. As part of the updates, when a creator says the words “like” or “subscribe,” YouTube will add a visual cue over the corresponding buttons as a way to prompt you to actually click or tap them.</p>
<p id="T50ae0">Here’s a GIF from Google showing what that might look like — watch the “subscribe” button in the lower-right corner of the GIF.</p>
