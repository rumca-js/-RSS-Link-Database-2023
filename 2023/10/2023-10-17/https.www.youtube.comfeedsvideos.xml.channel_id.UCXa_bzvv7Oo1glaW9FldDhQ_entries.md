Alan Wake was released in 2010 following an extensive development cycle, and it's still remembered for its intriguing narrative. Now, over 13 years later, Remedy Entertainment is set to deliver a sequel, one that's bigger, longer and scarier.

Alan Wake 2 sees the titular author trapped in The Dark Place, seeking a way out. In the real world, FBI profiler Saga Anderson arrives in Bright Falls to investigate several murders, eventually becoming involved in Wake's circumstances. Players can control both, exploring Saga's Mind Place to organize clues or Wake's Writing Room to arrange various scenes.

These mechanics are a significant departure from the first, but what other major changes does the sequel offer? Check out 15 of them here. Alan Wake 2 launches on October 29th for Xbox Series X/S, PS5 and PC.

Milestone did a great job with Hot Wheels Unleashed, which excellently combines a simple yet satisfying arcade racing with a wide assortment of Hot Wheels-based vehicles. 

There were a few minor issues here and there, but its sequel Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 does a good job of correcting those flaws. And that results in a game that’s better in almost every regard, right from the revamped Career mode to expanded movement options and better track layouts. 

A few minor cracks do leave something to be desired but looking at the whole picture, it’s a sequel that’s unmissable for fans of the first game. And even if you aren’t a really big fan of Hot Wheels, it’s still a solid racer that’s worth a look.
