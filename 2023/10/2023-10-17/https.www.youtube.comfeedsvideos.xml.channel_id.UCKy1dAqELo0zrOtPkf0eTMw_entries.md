In today's Daily Fix:
Game Pass subscribers are getting even more games to play this month, headlined by the Dead Space remake—perfect timing for a late-night Halloween gaming session. We loved this new Dead Space, giving it a nine out of ten. Other titles coming to the service are Like a Dragon: Ishin!, Mineko's Night Market, F1 Manager 2023, and more. And for a game you should probably avoid, there's Skull Island: Rise of Kong, which is definitely NOT on Xbox Game Pass. The game is getting absolutely roasted by the internet, with many pointing out it's decidedly unfinished state. Lies of P, which got an eight out of ten from us, is doing incredibly well sales-wise. The game has sold around one million units in less than a month, and that's considering it's available at no charge to Game Pass subscribers.

There’s perhaps no franchise better-suited for VR than Assassin’s Creed, starting with the fact that strapping on a VR headset bears an awful lot in common with stepping into the Animus. We half-expected Nexus to be little more than yet another half-baked tech demo, but instead, we were stunned to find that this is a full-on Assassin’s Creed adventure, complete with a lengthy story mode that has you playing as either Ezio in Renaissance-era Italy, Connor in Colonial America, or Kassandra in Ancient Greece. Previewed on Meta Quest 3 by Travis Northup.
