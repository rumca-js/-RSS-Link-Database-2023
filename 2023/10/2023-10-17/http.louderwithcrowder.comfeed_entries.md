	Pierre Poilievre is the conservative alternative to Prime Minster Justin "I Feel Pretty" Trudeau. Maybe.  Canada's walking pile of soy and hair goop only gets around 33% of the Canadian vote, but because of the stoonad way Canadians vote, he adds that to other candidates and becomes Prime Minister somehow. This is what countries get for not having a two-party system.

	Poilievre is the opposition party leader, and how he handles a journactivist in this viral video needs to be studied by America's opposition party. I've been wanting to see conservatives answer questions like this ever since I saw Jon Moxley do it in a WWE promo. When a journalismer starts a question with "people say..." the only response is "what people?" and "who are these people?"
