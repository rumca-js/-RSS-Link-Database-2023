With the deal, Amazon plans to upgrade from traditional Microsoft Office software to the Redmond company&#8217;s cloud productivity suite, according to the report, which notes that Amazon had previously been reluctant to use cloud-based technologies from Microsoft given the rivalry between Azure and AWS.
