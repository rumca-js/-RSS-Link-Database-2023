Undamaged neighboring plants sense the released VOCs as danger cues to activate defense responses against upcoming threats. This phenomenon of airborne communication among plants through VOCs was first documented in 1983 and has since been observed in more than 30 different plant species. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying VOC perception to defense induction remain unclear.", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2023-10-real-time-visualization-plant-plant-communications-airborne.html", "date_published": "2023-10-17T05:00:01+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "album": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "user": null, "language": "en-us", "thumbnail": "https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/tmb/2023/unlocking-natures-sile.jpg"}, {"source": "https://phys.org/rss-feed/", "title": "EU to seek virtual elimination of fossil fuels at COP28", "description": "The EU will seek a global phase-out of fossil fuels and for their use to reach a peak in this decade, according to the member states' common position adopted unanimously late Monday.", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2023-10-eu-virtual-fossil-fuels-cop28.html", "date_published": "2023-10-17T04:01:19+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "album": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "user": null, "language": "en-us", "thumbnail": "https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/tmb/2023/dubai-will-host-the-co.jpg"}, {"source": "https://phys.org/rss-feed/", "title": "How a Bronze Age rock became a 'treasure map' for researchers", "description": "A piece of rock with mysterious markings that lay largely unstudied for 4,000 years is now being hailed as a \"treasure map\" for archaeologists, who are using it to hunt for ancient sites around north-western France.", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2023-10-bronze-age-treasure.html", "date_published": "2023-10-17T03:59:20+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "album": "Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories", "user": null, "language": "en-us", "thumbnail": "https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/tmb/2023/the-latest-dig-has-alr.jpg"}, {"source": "https://phys.org/rss-feed/", "title": "Math disabilities hold many students back.
