</p><p>A Japanese lawyer representing Bandai Namco filed the trademark application at the United States Patent and Trademark Office on 26th September. 
</p><p>Whilst it may not sound like much, this is pretty much the only Dragon Ball Z-flavoured news we've had since the new Budokai Tenkaichi instalment &ndash; which is called Dragon Ball Z: Sparking! series in Japan &ndash; was announced back in March.

</p><p>Whilst we often get these hints from unlocked LinkedIn pages or dataminers, this time, it is the developer/publisher itself, Neowiz, that let slip courtesy of its recruitment site.
</p><p>As spotted by Okami13, Neowiz's <a href="https://www.neowiz.com/neowiz/careers">site</a> gives a little overview of its latest title, Lies of P, where it proudly displays that it was the most wanted game on PlayStation.

</p><p>The union was formed after CDPR announced a third wave of job cuts in as many months, driving developers to unionise as a means of "improving their workplace/industry standards in a way that has legal power and amplifies their voices".
</p><p>"We started talking about unionizing after the 2023 wave of layoffs when nine per cent of Reds (that is roughly 100 people) were let go," the union explains on the <a href="https://gamedevunion.pl/?page_id=88&amp;lang=en">Gamedevunion.pl</a> website (as translated by Google Translate).

</p><p>In fairness, the store description and its accompanying tags have been tweaked routinely throughout the year, but according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2124490/history/">Steam DB</a>, there's been a flurry of activity through September and now October, including confirmation of language subtitles (Brazillian, Portuguese, and Ukrainian), tags, and Steam achievements, hinting that the in-game achievements have been finalised and signed off. The store assets and images have also been refreshed, too.
</p><p>Concrete proof that an update or release is imminent? Hardly. But it's

</p><p>Confirmation came in the action-packed Call of Duty Next event earlier this week, when co-studio head Chris Plummer said the delay was down to the team wanting to "polish up" the mobile spin-off. 
</p><p>This means that the original "fall (Q3) 2023" window has now been pushed back to spring (Q2) 2024.

## Dungeons & Dragons and the thrill of nearly losing everything in a game

And it really rattled me. I think it rattled the whole group. Even the Dungeon Master seemed shaken by it, which I didn't expect. And when he told us that in the 12 years he's been DMing, he's never had an entire group go that close to a total wipeout before, I began to understand why. He was convinced we were done for. I think we all were.</p><p>Honestly, I never realised a TPK, as the cool kids call it, was such a big deal. Or so rare. I mean, obviously I knew dying was a bad thing, because when is it not? But I'd never thought about what would happen if it did happen, if that makes sense - what would come next. And I'd never thought about it because I never thought it would happen to us, wh

## Emma's Adventures: I painted landscapes in the horribly violent world of Rust

Wrong. It's a nightmare zone full of death, paranoia and the most irritating players you'll find in a multiplayer game. It's been made that way by design, of course - the driving idea behind Rust is survival, and having to watch your back for other players is a key part of this. Base-building becomes a matter of outwitting other players with solutions such as fake walls, impenetrable cave bases, and chests hidden under bear rugs. Journeys into the wilderness, meanwhile, require careful planning: just how much are you prepared to lose, and what backup resources do you have on standby for when you inevitably die? </p><p>It's a brutal, anarchic environment. Moments where players deviate from the cycle of violence are rare - and perhaps all the more precious
