<p>The versatile mid-season basic you can style in multiple ways</p><p>Sweater weather klaxon! At the time of writing, coat weather did not look to be approaching with any immediate urgency. Instead, it’s time to focus on knitwear to bridge the gap between seasons. Half-zip knits have had a steady climb in popularity in the last year. This athleisure staple was seen at Loewe SS24 (below) and a few seasons ago on the runways at JW Anderson and Alaïa, and spotted as a recurring sweater at Isabel Marant. It has the right amount of detail to stand apart from a plain sweater. And can, surprisingly, be styled in many different ways and layered to continue wearing when we do hit single-digit weather.</p><p>Choose from cropped and fitted to oversized and snuggly, perfectly pair with boyfriend jeans. The high-street has followed suit with half-zip sweaters coming in every shade of neutral through to pastel shades and bold red as well as striped versions. Layer a rollneck underneath, style wit

There is the small matter of a quarter-final against a revitalised New Zealand next weekend and plenty more ferociously hard yards still to cover.

<p>A bunker mentality is not enough to unsettle champions: there must be a threat from players carrying the ball in wide areas</p><p>How do you beat Manchester City? It’s a question football has been trying and largely failing to answer for six years. The two best options seem to be to wait for some traumatic external event to disrupt the season and scramble everybody’s minds, or hope that Pep Guardiola becomes so obsessed by the possibility of being counterattacked that he does something eccentric with his formation (although that tends to work best in Europe). Or you could just wait for Rodri to be unavailable.</p><p>Rodri has not played in any of City’s past three defeats (and he didn’t start the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/11/southampton-manchester-city-carabao-cup-quarter-final-match-report">2-0 defeat at Southampton</a> that saw them eliminated from last season’s Carabao Cup).

Talking to the <em>Observer</em> on the eve of the broadcasts, he spoke candidly about the dangers of taking on the disturbing role of the paedophile entertainer and suggested that predators and bullies often adopt a charismatic persona to mask their abuses.</p><p>“Savile could control every room intuitively. With any predator, almost across the board – and including people in entertainment – there’s an ability to hide behind a professional disposition,” said Coogan. “The court jester thing that Savile put on for his career, and for his subterfuge, was a suit of armour for him.

The cost of feasibility work went from £3.5m to £12m, as 18 options were explored for achieving this mundane task. The preferred one proved unacceptably hazardous to some canal bridges under which it would pass. The next foundered when a landowner demanded £2.8m for permission for the supply to cross their property, to which HS2 objected, only to see the figure raised to £7m by an independent valuer. The option eventually chosen started construction earlier this year, three years behind schedule, at several times the origina

As newly unearthed short stories are published, fans and friends celebrate the late author’s enduring legacy</p><p>“Of all the dead authors in the world, Terry Pratchett is the most alive,” said John Lloyd at the author’s memorial in 2015. This sentiment remains as true now, 40 years after the publication of Pratchett’s first Discworld novel, The Colour of Magic. The anniversary has been commemorated in a set of illustrated Royal Mail stamps. There’s been a show dedicated to Pratchett at the Edinburgh fringe. A Kickstarter for a graphic novel adaptation of Good Omens, the book he co-wrote with Neil Gaiman, became the number one comics campaign in Kickstarter history, bringing in more than £2.4m; a second series of the TV adaptation was also released.</p><p>All this would make 2023 an impressive year by any writer’s standards – but happened in the month of August alone.

<p>The frontman of Sly and the Family Stone brought the house down at Woodstock with a performance of I Want To Take You Higher. These extracts from his new memoir depict a life as vivid and riotous as the music of his band</p><p>They sent an army helicopter to take me to Woodstock, or at least an army-style helicopter. As I flew in I couldn’t see the whole crowd, but you could see enough people dotting the landscape that it was hard to believe that there were even more. “Goddamn”. I said to myself. “Goddamn. What the fuck is this?” So many people, an ocean of them without any land for miles. When something is that big a deal, be sure you’re ready.</p><p>That was still my thought on stage. Did I feel the moment as pressure? I knew we had to live up to it, not to mention rise to the level of the other artists. Janis Joplin was on before us, and then there was a break, and it was like the sky split open with rain. More than one of us was afraid to touch the equipment because of the dan

<p>No famous capitals, fewer tourists, loads to see, excellent food – and all a train ride away</p><p>The Netherlands’ second city is a winner for those weary of its more famous (and oversubscribed) rival. Sure, there’s water – it’s Europe’s largest port, after all – with rivers, canals and harbours at every turn. But this sprawling metropolis doesn’t yield its pleasures as easily as Amsterdam, largely because second world war bombing destroyed most of the historic centre. Its pioneering postwar architecture is, however, what makes “Manhattan on the Maas” so fascinating. <br /><br />Treasures include the 1970s <a href="https://www.kubuswoning.nl/en/" title="">Cube Houses</a> designed by Piet Blom, the landmark cable-stayed Erasmus Bridge, the 1960 retro-futuristic <a href="https://euromast.nl/en/" title="">Euromast</a> and eclectic buildings in the leafily landscaped <a href="https://en.rotterdam.info/locations/museumpark-en/" title="">Museumpark.</a> Alongside design museum <a href=

<p>The Nobel prize winner and author of new book Economics in America argues economists must get back to serving society</p><p>When Angus Deaton arrived in the US four decades ago, he imagined he had something to say about economic inequality and how to tackle it that Americans might want to hear. Instead, the great economic minds of the time told him to shut up.</p><p>The Scottish-born winner of the 2015 Nobel prize for economics struggled at first to understand why there was so little interest in a subject most European economists regarded as a central concern of post-war policies to reduce poverty and build more equitable societies.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2023/oct/07/angus-deaton-interview-book-economics-in-america">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Faro is much more than a gateway to the Algarve: fans of modernism are now waking up to the way its sharp, angular buildings shine in the southern sun</p><p>In the glare of the morning sun, the streets of downtown Faro are a textural hot mess. A faded art deco shopfront sits cheek by crumbling jowl with its neighbour’s rusting balustrades and handmade fondant tiles. A bank swerves around the corner like an ice-cream sandwich hit by pistachio light. Everywhere there are buildings you might generously describe as less art and more nouveau. These are layers of the near past – and I’m smitten.</p><p>But in this overlooked city, crowded with dusty anomalies, it is the modernist architecture – strict, sharp, punctuated by flat roofs and sloping angles – that attracts the most attention. Faro has more than 500 of these mid-century buildings, the highest concentration in southern Europe. Perversely, it’s only now that the curious are taking note.

<p>It’s the seeds, cores and peel that contain all the pectin in an apple, so don’t chuck those scraps – save them for jelly, and put the fruit itself in a pie</p><p>When I make apple pie or crumble, I don’t peel the apples. Originally, this was to save on wastage and to boost nutrition, but I’ve now acquired a taste for it, not least because peeled apples often turn soft and mushy, like baby food. That said, apple scraps (cores, seeds and peelings) can be put to good use in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/sep/21/core-subject-how-to-turn-apple-peelings-into-healthy-vinegar">vinegar</a> and today’s pectin jelly, for example. Use the jelly to set low-pectin and low-sugar jams, or just spread it on toast.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/oct/07/use-apple-scraps-make-pectin-jelly-pie-recipe-tom-hunt-zero-waste-cooking">Continue reading...</a>
