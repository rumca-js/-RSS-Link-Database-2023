The developer, who works for Naughty Dog, has already fixed the job entry to remove any mention of a remaster, but that doesn't mean it's erased from the internet (just ask Beyonc\u00e9 how easy it is to get things taken down). The Last of Us Part 2 was released on the PS4 a few months before the PlayStation 5 hit stores, and it would follow Naughty Dog's MO to make an updated version of a Last of Us game for the generation above what the original game came out for, e.g. The Last of Us and its PS4 remaster a few short years after the original PS3 version was released. In related news, a bakery made a Clicker out of bread. Yes, the fungus zombies from The Last of Us are now edible. And bad news for developer Telltale Games, as they're the latest studio to be hit with massive layoffs.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMgzW3AONgo", "date_published": "2023-10-07T00:22:27+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "Ign - YouTube", "album": "Ign - YouTube", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/eMgzW3AONgo/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Netflix Renews Castlevania: Nocturne for Season 2 - IGN The Fix: Entertainment", "description": "Castlevania: Nocturne will be back for a second season, according to Netflix.

In space news, NASA and Star Wars' Mark Hamill are teaming up for an educational web series highlights the scientific discoveries made aboard the International Space Station.
