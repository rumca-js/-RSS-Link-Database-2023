Cyberpunk 2077 and Starfield are obviously going for two very different kinds of experiences, with the former being much more cinematic and narrative-driven, and the latter being more focused on its systems-driven sandbox. But as massive first-person RPGs, they also have plenty in common, to the point where it's quite easy to make comparisons between the two, especially at a time when both of them are so heavily in the zeitgeist.

There's a whole lot to love about Starfield, and though Cyberpunk 2077 had a rough couple of years after launch, at this point, after Update 2.0 and Phantom Liberty there's plenty to like about it as well- but when the two are pit against each other, which one comes out on top? Here, we're going to try and answer that question, as we compare the Bethesda and CD Projekt RED RPGs across multiple categories.

For the foreseeable future, Sony will continue delivering its speciality: High-budget, triple-A single-player titles based on its best-known IPs. The PlayStation 5 will continue to sell millions and set new records for the company. We'll likely forget that there's anything wrong behind the scenes or that some of its plans (like PlayStation VR2, which has fallen by the wayside since launching this year) aren't panning out.

However, it feels like the walls are closing in on Sony's live-service games initiative when it never really got off the ground. Some studios like Naughty Dog may continue as normal, but for the hundreds of developers toiling away on other projects, the future seems tenuous.
