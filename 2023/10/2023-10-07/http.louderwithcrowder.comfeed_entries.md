He didn't like the free preview of socialism that Gavin Newsom was forcing on the state, so he moved to the most LA-ish city he could find in a red state. Austin is like methadone for blue-state city folk. However, as we hear on a recent episode of the Joe Rogan Experience, the school indoctrination helped play a role in his move too.</p><p>His kids' Los Angeles school hired an anti-racism expert to make the white students feel bad about themselves. Remember, it's not enough to not be racist. You have to be "anti-racist."

When asked about why so many Americans refuse to believe what an awesome job he's doing, Biden -- with a straight face -- blamed the media for only reporting the negative stories. No one found this more amusing than Doocy.</p><p><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/biden-drowning-dog" target="_blank">Here are Biden's bars from yesterday</a>: "You turn on the television, and there's not a whole lot about 'boy saves dog as he swims in the lake,' ya know?
