On this episode of the GeekWire Podcast, we reenact portions of Nadella&#8217;s testimony, explain the positions staked out by Microsoft and Google in the case, and discuss the irony of Microsoft siding with the DOJ two decades after fighting its own antitrust battle. Plus, Generative AI and the &#8220;Ghost of Lesser Seattle.&#8221; We revisit our attempt to channel the late, great Seattle&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/geekwire-podcast-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-vs-google-ai-channels-the-ghost-of-lesser-seattle/">Read More</a>
