announced back in March.\n</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/bandai-namco-has-filed-a-us-trademark-for-sparking-zero-dragon-ball-z-budokai-tenkaichis-japanese-name\">Read more</a></p>",

Wrong. It's a nightmare zone full of death, paranoia and the most irritating players you'll find in a multiplayer game.

Base-building becomes a matter of outwitting other players with solutions such as fake walls, impenetrable cave bases, and chests hidden under bear rugs.
