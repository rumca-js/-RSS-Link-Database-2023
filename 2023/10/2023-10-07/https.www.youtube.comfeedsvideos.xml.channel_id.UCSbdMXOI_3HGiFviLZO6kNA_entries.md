Hello! 
This is probably the longest review period for any VR headset I have ever tried; for the past 6 months I've been using the beyond just about every single day. I've found a lot of positives- I really like the beyond, but it's not perfect and its certainly not for everyone. 

But It just might be the best PCVR headset available if you can stomach the price. I will be re-reviewing the Varjo Aero soon and Reviewing the Pimax Crystal as well. 

I hope you enjoy this video.
