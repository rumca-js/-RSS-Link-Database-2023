On Friday, Sept. 29, Wilco released their latest album, "Cousin." The Current’s Bill DeVille connected with longtime Wilco guitarist Nels Cline to talk about the new album, of course, but also about what it’s like on the inside of Wilco World.

”To speak to the 19 years with this current lineup, we get along, obviously,” Cline says. “We have a really good time playing together, and we have a good time on the road … and there's just a ton of mutual respect. I really consider these gentlemen my brothers.”

Watch and listen to the complete interview above.
