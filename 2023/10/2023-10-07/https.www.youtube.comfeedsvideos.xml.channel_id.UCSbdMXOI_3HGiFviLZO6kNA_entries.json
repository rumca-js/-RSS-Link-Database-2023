I've found a lot of positives- I really like the beyond, but it's not perfect and its certainly not for everyone. \n\nBut It just might be the best PCVR headset available if you can stomach the price. I will be re-reviewing the Varjo Aero soon and Reviewing the Pimax Crystal as well. \n\nI hope you enjoy this video.\nJoin up in my community to talk about VR and join VR meetups!\nhttps://discord.gg/Thrill\n\nSupport my content:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/Thrillseeker\n\n\nIn case you're interested in the Beyond here is a non affiliate link:\nhttps://www.bigscreenvr.com\n\nintro music:\nMusic provided by Monstercat:\nhayve - Flow\nhttps://youtube.com/c/monstercat\n\noutro Music:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6JwgNQDVfI&amp;pp=ygUMdGhyaWxsIG1hZ2lj", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCXmv27o3AU", "date_published": "2023-10-07T19:39:55+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "Thrillseeker", "album": "Thrillseeker", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/ZCXmv27o3AU/hqdefault.jpg"}]
