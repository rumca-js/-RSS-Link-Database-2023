		The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce is concerned about delays in the implementation of Sri Lanka’s digital ID system. In a <a href="https://www.chamber.lk/index.php/news/9-media-releases/1321-ceylon-chamber-stresses-digital-id-imperative-for-sri-lanka-s-digital-transformation">statement</a> published on its website, the group stressed the importance of digital identity for reviving Sri Lanka’s economy, and pointed to nations such as Kenya, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/digital-identity-becomes-option-for-most-singaporeans-when-they-vote">Singapore</a> and India as examples where substantive investment in digital public infrastructure has led to growth and an increased competitive edge in the global marketplace.

In a move aimed at increasing ID acceptance rates and reducing fraud, <a href="https://www.centralams.com/">CentralAMS</a>, which provides identity orchestration platforms, KYC/AML and digital payment systems for the gambling industry, has signed a three-year deal with <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/idemia">Idemia</a>, the French identity verification services company, according to a release.

		The effectiveness of the best presentation attack detection (PAD) software for face biometrics is sufficient to give businesses that use it confidence they are catching most spoof attempts, at least based on the latest laboratory testing.

The inaugural evaluation of PAD technologies by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for the Face Analysis Technology Evaluation (FATE) has results several of the leading developers can claim as wins. Perhaps most encouraging for businesses is the improved performance that can be achieved by <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202309/nist-unmasks-results-of-presentation-attack-detection-and-image-defect-software-testing">combining multiple PAD algorithms</a>.

		Authors of a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01006.pdf">position paper</a> which delves into the technical and legislative frameworks of some digital identity systems around the world have expressed a penchant for the self-sovereign identity (SSI) model, saying it offers “the best technical and governance conditions for building a national digital identity management system.”

This, the authors believe, is especially important in a context where state surveillance and all forms of cyber-crime are on the rise, just as is the yearning for trust by citizens and even service providers.

SSI systems based on blockchain infrastructure place a high premium on personal data protection and privacy, they argue.

“SSI operate in zero-trust environments where the trust is rooted

		The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC) is seeking help with some biometric housekeeping as it rolls out new guidelines on how to responsibly handle and process biometric information. In a formal <a href="https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-news/news-and-announcements/2023/an_231011/">announcement</a>, the OPC put out a call for feedback on the draft documents from stakeholders in the biometrics sector, in a move to bring its published guidelines in line with the contemporary realities of cybersecurity, fraud and digital ID.

Commissioner Philippe Dufresne says the existing guidelines, published in 2011, are out of date. “From <a href="https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-actions-and-decisions/ar_index/202021/sr_rcmp/">police use of facial recognition technology</a> t

		The <a href="https://www.dta.gov.au/">Digital Transformation Agency</a> (DTA) is warning that laws allowing authorities to use one-to-many face biometric matching techniques, even in extremely limited circumstances, could put a chill on digital ID adoption in Australia.

An <a href="https://www.innovationaus.com/dta-warns-face-matching-law-could-spook-digital-id/">article</a> on InnvationAus.com quotes the DTA as saying that the allowance is a “significant change and will have a detrimental impact on the uptake of matching services by the community if it is perceived as lowering confidence”.
