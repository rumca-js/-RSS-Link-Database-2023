The former Cinerama is now SIFF Cinema, as new signs went up Thursday on the Belltown building that SIFF took over from the estate of Paul Allen in May. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), SIFF called it an honor to put its name where the Cinerama signs once hung. &#8220;We do not take for granted how special it is to see SIFF&#8217;s name on the exterior of this iconic building,&#8221; the @SIFFNews account wrote. &#8220;And we can&#8217;t wait to welcome you back into this space.

GeekWire spotted lease signs at the company&#8217;s former 9,000 square-foot Seattle headquarters near the new waterfront project. The real estate startup confirmed that it vacated the space on Sept. 1 and now occupies a 4,000 square-foot office at 500 Union St. Suite 325 in downtown Seattle. &#8220;The move away from the waterfront was because our lease was up and because&#160;the new office we found which best met our needs happened to be in this location,&#8221; said Flyhomes spokesperson Justin O&#8217;Neill.
