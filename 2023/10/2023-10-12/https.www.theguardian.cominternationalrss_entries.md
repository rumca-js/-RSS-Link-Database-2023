After the glorious madness of last season, when he and his Manchester City teammates pulled off the ultimate treble, there was always the possibility he would feel a little bit discombobulated when he got back to work. He agrees that it has been the case, even if he cannot quite find the right words to describe it.</p><p>Grealish has endured a difficult season so far, which is one of the reasons why he is so keen to put on a show for England in the friendly against Australia at Wembley on Friday night. And in the Euro 2024 qualifier against Italy next Tuesday, also at the national stadium.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/12/jack-grealish-aims-to-kickstart-season-amid-englands-unfinished-business">Continue reading...</a>

## Friday the 13th review – original teen horror classic now looks bizarrely innocent

<p>The film that kicked off the franchise sees swimsuit-clad young adults picked off one by one in gruesome fashion at the site of an unsolved double murder</p><p>Sean S Cunningham’s teen horror classic from 1980 is now rereleased: this is the original movie, the ancestral prequel or origin myth machine-tooled to create a franchise, that readies the noisome and mostly offscreen figure of Jason Voorhees as an almost supernatural surviving villain of the future series – although this went against the idea of his supposed death in this film as the premise for a more rational psychological thriller. This franchise clearly arose from the wild popularity of John Carpenter’s Halloween, although Friday the 13th openly borrows from a much more venerable model, Hitchcock’s Psycho, in the screeching Herrmannesque strings and the oedipal complex behind the horror – although this one being rather ingeniously showed from the point of view of the mother, Mrs Pamela Voorhees, played by Betsy Palmer.
