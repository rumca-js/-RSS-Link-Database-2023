<p>The launch of Starlink's much-anticipated satellite cellular service, Direct-to-Cell, will reportedly begin rolling out for SMS in 2024, according to <a href="https://direct.starlink.com/">a newly published promotional site by the company</a>. Eventually the system will "enable ubiquitous access to texting, calling, and browsing wherever you may be on land, lakes, or coastal waters," and connect to IoT devices through the LTE standard.</p>
<p>Starlink has partnered with T-Mobile on the project, which was originally <a href="https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-starlink-partnership-012539605.html">announced last August</a> at the "Coverage and Above and Beyond" event. The collaboration sees T-Mobile setting aside a bit of its 5G spectrum for use by Starlink's second-generation satellites; Starlink in turn will allow T-Mobile phones to access the satellite network giving the cell service provider "<a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=450bac9f-8

<p>The European Union (EU) has <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_4953">opened an investigation</a> into X (formerly Twitter) for lackluster moderation of illegal content and disinformation in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war. The move, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a4ab23c7-977a-46b1-8d00-33923ceaee89">via</a> <em>Financial Times</em>, comes two days after EU Commissioner Thierry Breton <a href="https://www.engadget.com/eu-official-warns-elon-musk-about-xs-handling-of-disinformation-amid-israel-hamas-war-210909999.html">sent an “urgent” letter</a> to X owner Elon Musk asking the billionaire about the company’s handling of misinformation.

That’s the bizarre premise behind the upcoming <em>EA Sports FC Tactical</em>, a mobile title heading to iOS and Android in early 2024. The company says the most peculiar installment in its decades-old franchise (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/fifa-23-ea-sports-fc-branding-170729395.html">formerly FIFA</a>) results in “authentic football action like never before.”</p>
<p>As its description suggests, matches will be simulated, so you won’t directly control players’ actions like in traditional sports games. Instead, it focuses on in-game strategies like player stamina and power-play management. Playable modes include online-friendly matches and “intense online competitions” like Rank matches, Leagues, and Guilds. It sounds like a sports

<p>Netflix used to make its money on physical media, mailing DVDs to customers, and it looks like the company’s trending toward the analog once again. The streaming giant has, strangely, decided to open a number of brick-and-mortar retail locations, called Netflix House, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-12/netflix-to-open-stores-where-fans-can-play-shop-and-eat-in-2025?cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-tech&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall&amp;sref=10lNAhZ9#xj4y7vzkg"><ins>as originally reported by </ins><em><ins>Bloomberg.</ins></em></a></p>
<p>The stores will sell merchandise based on hit Netflix shows, so you can finally snag that <em>Lincoln Lawyer</em> coffee mug you’ve always dreamed of. Netflix House establishments will also offer dining and curated live experiences. To the latter point, the two initial locations are going to feature an obstacle course based on <em>Squid Game</em>.

Google announced Thursday that users who have opted-in for its Search Generative Experience (SGE) will be able to <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/google-search-generative-ai-october-update/">create AI images directly from the standard Search bar</a>.</p>
<p>SGE is Google’s vision for our web searching future. Rather than picking websites from a returned list, the system will synthesize a (reasonably) coherent response to the user’s natural language prompt using the same data that the list’s links led to. Thursday’s updates are a natural expansion of that experience, simply returning generated images (using the company’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-imagen-text-to-image-ai-unprecedented-photorealism-144205123.html">Imagen text-to-picture AI</a>) instead of generated text.
