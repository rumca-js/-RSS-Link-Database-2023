The former Cinerama is now SIFF Cinema, as new signs went up Thursday on the Belltown building that SIFF took over from the estate of Paul Allen in May. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), SIFF called it an honor to put its name where the Cinerama signs once hung. &#8220;We do not take for granted how special it is to see SIFF&#8217;s name on the exterior of this iconic building,&#8221; the @SIFFNews account wrote. &#8220;And we can&#8217;t wait to welcome you back into this space.

The ultra-green grocery supports Amazon&#8217;s efforts to become carbon neutral by 2040.
