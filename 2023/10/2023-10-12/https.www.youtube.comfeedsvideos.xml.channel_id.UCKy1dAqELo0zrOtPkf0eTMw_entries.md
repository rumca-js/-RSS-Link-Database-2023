Rick and Morty season 7, reviewed by Samantha Nelson. Narrated by Erik Adams.

Justin Roiland’s departure hasn’t changed Rick and Morty. The yet-to-be-identified actors playing the title characters sound pretty much identical to Roiland. and the first two episodes of season 7 offer the same mix of sharp meta humor, emotional depth, and grotesque animation that has always made Rick and Morty great, delivering bombastic standalone adventures that offer just a bit of character growth.

Star Trek Infinite reviewed by Will Borger on PC.

Clearly inspired by Paradox's Stellaris, Infinite does a great job of capturing the look and feel of Star Trek, but those enticing bones splinter under the weight of its bugs and glitches. Each Major Power feels distinct, Mission Trees add choices and story elements to encourage you to roleplay your faction a certain way, and the consistent date and map set-up provides room for experimentation and familiarity in each new run. But that doesn’t matter much if none of it works properly. You can see the promise here, but it’s held back by so many problems that it can be hard to enjoy right now.

Lords of The Fallen reviewed on PC by Travis Northup. Also available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.

Lords of the Fallen is a great soulslike, and its killer new idea of swapping between two versions of the world to solve puzzles and slay enemies is an excellent twist to set it apart from the pack. That concept is unfortunately hamstrung by numerous, highly annoying technical issues and weak boss fights, but awesome explorable areas and fantastic buildcrafting more than make up for those shortcomings. If, like me, you’re a sucker for a quality action-RPG even amid a clear overabundance of them, then this reboot is well worth your time.
