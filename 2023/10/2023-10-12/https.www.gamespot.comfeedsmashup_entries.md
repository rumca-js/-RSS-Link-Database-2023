<p dir="ltr">D3Publisher has announced that Earth Defense Force 6--which initially launched in Japan in August 2022--will be traveling West on both PlayStation and PC next spring.</p><p dir="ltr">EDF 6 is set two years after the previous game, which saw humans victorious against a race of invading aliens called Primers. Some Primers managed to survive, however, and conflicts continue to surface between the two sides on what remains of Earth, as 90% of the planet's population has been destroyed.</p><p dir="ltr">Players will choose between multiple classes--Air Raider, Fencer, Ranger, and Wing Diver--as they fight against the Primers and their hordes of massive monsters. The game will offer "hundreds" of missions, new weapons and abilities for each class, and the ability for both two-player local split screen co-op and four-player online co-op.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/earth-defense-force-6-is-coming-to-the-west-next-spring/1100-6518356/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Conti

<p>To keep up with the demands of modern games, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-slim-playstation-5-models-announced-all-digital-sees-50-price-increase/1100-6518283/">new PS5 slim console</a> will now include 1TB of internal storage capacity, an improvement over the base model's 825GB SSD. While that is roughly an entire Call of Duty of extra space, it remains to be seen how much of it is actually usable, as in the case of the launch model PS5, only 667GB of its included 825GB was available. The good news is that you'll still be able to expand the slimmer PS5 console's digital real estate, as like the original model, it'll support extra storage options.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://za.ign.com/playstation-5-slim/184144/news/sony-confirms-ps5-slim-will-still-support-expandable-storage">IGN</a>, a PlayStation spokesperson confirmed that there are no changes with the new model," which means that potential owners can still remove a panel and slot in an M.2 SSD.
