It's been a dramatic day for internet-sleuthing Mario fans; with Nintendo still tightlipped on who'll take over the role of the iconic plumber following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-says-charles-martinet-no-longer-video-game-voice-of-mario">Charles Martinet's acension to "Mario Ambassador"</a>, a fresh leak appeared to have finally revealed video gaming's current biggest secret. However, the actor in question - one Mick Wingert - has now thrown a bit of a spanner in the works by declaring that, no, it's not actually him.
</p><p>
To rewind a bit, all this started when (<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/marios-new-voice-actor-potentially-revealed-via-demo-datamine/">thanks VGC</a>) an anonymous 4chan forum user shared images and details said to be from a US kiosk demo for Switch's soon

Alien: Blackout, the Amanda Ripley-starring survival horror that launched on mobile back in 2019, is being delisted from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/alien-blackout/id1401510106">iOS App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.D3Go.mendel&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;gl=US">Google Play</a> on 31st October.
</p><p>
Alien: Blackout follows Amanda Ripley (daughter of Ellen Ripley) as she attempts to guide four survivors to safety aboard the Xenomorph-infested Mendel Station, viewing their progress through security cameras and via an overhead station map.

EA has shared more details on EA Sports FC Tactical, its previously announced free-to-play turn-based football spin-off, confirming it'll launch for iOS and Android early next year.
</p><p>
EA Sports FC Tactical was first mentioned during EA's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-sports-fc24-gets-first-trailer-gameplay-details-september-release-date">grand unveiling</a> for its new-look football series back in July. At the time, information on the game was limited, but the publisher has now shared a little more as pre-registration opens via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ea-sports-fc-tactical/id1583973420">iOS App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ea.gp.tacticalfootball&amp;pli=1">Google Play</a>.

Microsoft has unveiled a new Xbox Series X/S Starter Bundle, which'll include three months of Game Pass Ultimate when it launches worldwide on 31st October.
</p><p>
All in all, it's a pretty straightforward offering, packing in the Xbox Series S (which comes with 512GB storage), a wireless controller, and the aforementioned three months of Game Pass Ultimate - all for &pound;249.99.
</p><p>
It's the latter that sets the Starter Bundle apart from Microsoft's usual &pound;250 Xbox Series S offering, of course, meaning you're basically getting that three months of Game Pass Ultimate - which would ordinarily cost around &pound;40 - as a freebie.

Bungie has been unbanning Destiny 2 players who were accidentally banned and awarding them in-game currency as an apology.
</p><p>
A "small number" of players were inadvertently banned due to their accounts being flagged as having tampered with game client functionality.
</p><p>
These players are now being given 5000 Silver to use in the game, worth around &pound;40.

As President T'Pragh of the United Federation of Planets, it's routine for me to hear from the USS Enterprise, the pride and joy of our fleet. It's another for the message sender to be tiresome prodigy Wesley Crusher, historical bearer of unwanted news. This time, Wesley isn't the problem. The problem is that the Federation doesn't even have the Enterprise yet - building the flagship is a milestone mission in the game, and at this current point in time, there is no possible Enterprise from which Ensign Crusher could be hailing me from. On an episode of The Next Generation, this could easily be a setup for a fun pocket dimension-themed episode or a time loop narrative, but it's not. This is the erratic world of Star Trek: Infinite, a grand strategy reskin of Stellaris that boldly goes to places that don't always make sens

Valve is introducing SMS verification for developers as part of its new security measures on Steamworks. This follows earlier incidents of hackers taking over several developers' accounts on the platform, where they added malware to various game builds.
</p><p>
These attacks, which were verified by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/steam-malware-attack-new-security/">PC Gamer</a>, only affected less than 100 Steam users, although NanoWar: Cells VS Virus (pictured above) developer Beno&icirc;t Freslon recently revealed the hackers had taken control of his browser access tokens. This essentially gave the hackers access to any service Freslon had been logged into. </p><p>"I just used my dev account to release the game few hours before the hack I suppose," he shared on X (formerly Twitter). </p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stea

She's a fierce warrior, but she's crying tears of blood. After a tense battle of graceful sweeping sword arcs - and me frantically dodging - she sprouts a set of scarlet wings, flies upwards, and proceeds to rain down hell.
</p><p>
This is Pieta, the first proper boss in Lords of the Fallen after the tutorial. Or, as I like to call her, Budget Malenia. It's abundantly clear where developer Hexworks has taken inspiration, leaning into the most popular aspects of FromSoftware's Souls games - here Elden Ring's most celebrated encounter. Pieta is emblematic of the game as a whole: Lords of the Fallen looks like Souls, it plays like Souls, but it's an inferior imitation that's rough around the edges.
</p><p>
If the name seems familiar, you may remember the 2014 Lords of the Fallen from de

I recently got to test out PlayStation Access at a hands-on event in London, Sony's new customisable accessibility controller. I was one of a handful of people attending, some with disabilities and some without. With the device before us all, we prodded and poked, we customised, we compared our setups. And we were able to play a number of games ranging in complexity.
</p><p>
Sony recognises that disabilities are different for everyone and the Access isn't a universal solution. What works for one player may not work for another with the same disability. But that's why the Access is so reconfigurable, and Sony has carefully considered so many options. Even the packaging is accessible: evenly weighted and opened with one hand.
</p><p>
So how do you design an accessibility controller with so many variables? Sony looke

The Switch version of Mortal Kombat 1 has received a new update that's now live, promising numerous improvements.
</p><p>
The latest in the fighting series was released last month across PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo's console. However, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/70-mortal-kombat-1-switch-version-called-robbery-as-graphical-comparisons-flood-the-internet">Switch version was plagued with numerous issues</a> and vastly inferior visuals.

This new update includes visual improvements and bug fixes, performance improvements, and stability fixes, according to the patch notes.

Dead Island 2 has invited us all to indulge our fetishes with its first story expansion, Haus.
</p><p>
This expansion is set to arrive next month, on 2nd November, across PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and PC (via the Epic Games Store). It promises players a "surreal, psycho-horror dreamscape" as they use their investigative powers to check out a mysterious Malibu cult in a completely new story and setting.
</p><p>
So, what or who is Haus? Well, apparently Haus is a "paragon of a new future", something that has been "prophesied" by the techno-death cult's leader Konstantin. As expected, players will need to battle through zombies and gore, now with items such as the explosive K-rossbow and the Hog Roaster - apparently "the ultimate ticket to visceral slaying whilst you simultaneously butcher and BBQ zombie

Ubisoft seems happy with Assassin's Creed Mirage, which it says has similar play numbers at launch as recent games such as Origins and Odyssey.
</p><p>
This is positive, as both Origins and Odyssey were far bigger and costlier projects, whereas Mirage is - by design - more focused.

Among Us' murderous beans are about to see themselves faced with a whole new map, and it is full of secrets, deceit and mushrooms (the most evil of pizza toppings, in my opinion). That's right, Among Us is about to become among fungus.

The Fungle, as it is known, will be available across all platforms as part of a free update. It promises players the chance to immerse their Impostors and Crewmates in a "weird mushroom jungle". Are InnerSloth putting the fun in fungal? Well, we don't have long until we can find out, as this map launches in just a couple of weeks time, on 24th October.

Don't call me Ishmael. Today, you can call me the whole rabbling cast of the Pequod. This is the beautiful, improbable conceit at the heart of Saltsea Chronicles, because it's a game in which you put to sea not as a sailor but as a crew. And it's a crew that's already hurting, anxious and uncertain of things. A crewmate has disappeared without warning. Where did they go? Who took them, and why? The horizon calls.
</p><p>
Saltsea is set in a world that floats on the flooded remains of a prior world - maybe even our world. If so, were we good ancestors? Below the waves are strange creatures and old buildings that once claimed to scrape the sky, all threaded with skate parks of coral and ornamental fronds of disco kelp. Above? Above is everything that has survived, and has collapsed over time, and has had new thinking and new
