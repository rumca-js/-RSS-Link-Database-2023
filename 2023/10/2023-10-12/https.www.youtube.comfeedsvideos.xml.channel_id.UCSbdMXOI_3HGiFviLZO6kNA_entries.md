Hello. 

I finally got my hands on the Meta Quest 3; Since the Quest 2's launch 3 years ago, the headset has become not only the most recognizable and popular headset of all time, but it's become practically THE standard for VR. 

It's done an incredible job. Does its successor live up to the legacy left by the Quest 2? Well... maybe. If you have deeper pockets. 


I will be giving away the Quest 3 that was give to me in my discord/ on Twitch- JOIN UP!
