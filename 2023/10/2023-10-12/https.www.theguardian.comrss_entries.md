<p>Scotland may still make it to Euro 2024 but qualification will have to wait for another day and another place. A point in Seville would have sent them through with two games to spare, but a belting goal from Scott McTominay that seemed to have put them into the lead and within touching distance of the tournament was ruled out, the cruel verdict handed down by the VAR, and then their resistance was finally broken.

That leaves Scotland needing a poi

<p>The flaws of the awards, seen by the public as the only game in town, are hindering the pursuit of innovation<br /></p><ul><li>Martin Rees is the astronomer royal</li></ul><p>Every October sees the award of the “scientific Oscars”: Nobel prizes. The science prizes established in Alfred Nobel’s will are for physics, chemistry and “physiology or medicine”. This year the three scientific Nobels went to a total of eight scientists – rewarded for sustained efforts to tackle fundamental challenges. There will be special acclaim for the Hungarian medical researcher, Katalin Karikó, who persevered, despite much discouragement from her university, on the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/oct/02/scientists-whose-work-enabled-mrna-covid-vaccine-win-nobel-prize-for-medicine-katalin-kariko-drew-weissman">groundwork that led to several Covid vaccines</a>.</p><p>These three subjects are interpreted broadly, and their purview has shifted over time.

<p>In this extract from his new book, Andy Brassell talks to Miguel Cardoso, who carried on coaching academy players in Ukraine during the war in Donbas</p><p>While the Shakhtar Donetsk first team, and the Ukrainian Premier League at large, had conceived an improvised finish to 2013–14, the under-19 and under-21 seasons had just stopped. There needed to be a plan to resume for the following campaign and it was far from straightforward.</p><p>“The city was already taken by the separatists,” Miguel Cardoso, Shakhtar’s under-21 head coach and youth academy coordinator, says. “I went to Kyiv and far from home I discussed the situation with Sergei [Palkin, Shakhtar’s CEO]. He asked me: ‘Miguel, are you capable of going back to Donetsk?’” The club’s under-19 and under-21 teams were still in Donetsk, ready to begin their season. Cardoso quickly agreed to a task that he knew was big, but didn’t realise quite what an undertaking he had committed to until he was on the road.</p> <a href="https

<p><strong>Royal Court Upstairs, London<br /></strong>An aspiring journalist comes up against the difficulties of accurately representing his shisha-going community in Mohamed-Zain Dada’s energetic debut</p><p>This debut drama about the demonisation of Muslim identity begins as something of a bros comedy. Three young British Pakistanis meet in a shisha lounge to shoot the breeze and smoke the hookah. They talk about work, the old uncles at the mosque and dating. Asif (Salman Akhtar) and Rashid (Arian Nik) encourage the only university graduate between them, Jihad (Omar Bynon), to keep pursuing his dream of becoming a journalist even though he has tried and failed.</p><p>Jihad’s fortunes change when they give him the idea for a documentary about shisha lounges, and the camaraderie built among the largely male, Muslim community which inhabits them. So begins Jihad’s journey into selling himself to a podcast producer and selling out his friends. Fiona, from the production company, says

Aged 81, he has declared that this show is his “farewell to London”, a place he’s played regularly, and where he lived, in political exile, between 1969 and 1972. Where Gil’s London dates in July 2022 were in the run-up to a fraught Brazilian election, tonight the mood is much more celebratory, with a four-piece band comprising two of his children and two grandchildren.</p><p>Such is the breadth of his canon over the last 60 years that Gil only repeats six songs from last year.

<p><strong>(EMI Australia/Capitol Records)<br /></strong>Sex and romance abound on tracks that deliver both orgiastic, high-octane revelry and poetic introspection</p><p>This year’s charts have been dominated by high-tempo songs – perhaps powered by the intense content-dosing of TikTok, or a generation of young people back up to full speed post-pandemic. Among the finest is Rush, the big summer single by Australian pop star Troye Sivan. Built on a funky house rhythm – like Spiller’s Groovejet turned up to 126bpm – and with a rowdy chorus chanted as if by a troupe of distractingly buff personal trainers, it’s all sweat and heavy breathing; the music video, full of glory holes, hot bodies and lustful looks, underlines the kind of blood-pumping activity Sivan is getting at.</p><p>It is a thrill to hear Sivan back to his best – indeed bettering it. Having first found fame as a teen YouTuber, his solid debut album Blue Neighbourhood came out in 2015, balancing bombastic post-dubstep drum

<p>The best way to remind yourself why we need mass agriculture is to try it on a very small scale yourself</p><p>Recently, my family welcomed a new arrival. This event was keenly anticipated. We had watched it grow, fretted over its development. And then suddenly, there it was, sitting in the kitchen: a bright orange pumpkin, about the size of my head and equally as weirdly shaped. While I was thrilled to see it, I can take none of the credit for its production. The farmer was my wife, Pat, who fretted appropriately over the way the pumpkin plant clearly shut down all other production to bring forth this one beauty. A reasonably productive tomato plant kept it company.

<p>Combatants in this war have a duty not to target innocent people regardless of what they believe ‘the other side’ has done</p><p>During one of my several trips to Israel, I visited Sderot, thanks to an Israeli friend who loved showing his country to non-Israelis. The town has about 30,000 people, and the Gaza Strip, from which Israel withdrew in <a href="https://embassies.gov.il/MFA/AboutIsrael/Maps/Pages/Israels%20Disengagement%20Plan-%202005.aspx">2005</a> but has blockaded ever since, lies a mile or so away.</p><p>After Hamas’s 7 October attack on Israel, a horrifying video of Sderot emerged. Gunmen from Hamas, more specifically its military arm, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam, roamed its streets in pickup trucks and on foot. They had a common purpose of shooting anyone they encountered: pedestrians, people at a bus stop, motorists and motorcyclists.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/oct/12/israel-hamas-war-gaza-civilian-deaths">Continue reading...</a>

In May 2003, he went to New Zealand for a working holiday and to see more of the world. After three months, his savings ran out so he settled in Wellington and found a hospital job through a nursing agency.</p><p>At the end of that year, he met Sarah, who was working on the same ward. “I’d just finished my nursing training and was just enjoying the single life,” she says. Although she had seen Stuart around, it wasn’t until he asked a question about a medication chart that he really caught her attention. “When he spoke, I loved his accent. It was like I was hit by cupid’s arrow,” she says. “Something happened in that moment.” She began to ask him what he was up to at weekends, and inviting him to join a group of colleagues for

So she took him along to a boxing gym, as you do. The coaches there spotted something unusual about him. Most seven-year-olds burst into tears when they get punched for the first time.

Group J is not the toughest from a competitive point of view but Roberto Martínez’s side have been clinical in their performances. Belgium qualified for Euro 2020 under Martínez thanks to 10 wins in as many matches, and following that up with another perfect record would be a fine feat for the Spaniard, which would be made even better by a spotless defensive record when they finish this stage against Iceland next month.
