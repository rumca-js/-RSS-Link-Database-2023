While both are capable of handing over inordinate amounts of power to truly terrible people, only the Israeli companies have been formally asked by the US federal government [&#8230;]

Conservatives are making the rounds again, placing op-eds and analytical pieces explaining how book bans aren’t really book bans. For example, Education Week&#160;published a column&#160;by a pair of authors from the American Enterprise Institute and the Heritage Foundation trying to justify laws across the country that restrict and even remove certain texts from many public [&#8230;]

It never ends with these moral-panic-driven, blatantly unconstitutional state bills “for the children.” The latest, from New York state Senator Andrew Goundardes and Assemblymember Nily Rozic was announced this week with direct support from NY Governor Kathy Hochul (who has been pushing for such unconstitutional bills for a while now, mainly to redirect attention away [&#8230;]

This report [PDF], obtained by the newly-formed 404 Media, contains a lot of what we know, some of what we don&#8217;t know, and confirms a lot of suspicions.

As a reporter who has covered telecom for the better part of two decades, I&#8217;ve spent much of that time watching broadband giants like AT&#38;T and Comcast sock their captive customers with a wide variety of bullshit, sneaky fees designed to help them advertise one price, then charge you with a higher rate. It&#8217;s a [&#8230;]

It&#8217;s been a bad run of weeks lately for the company behind game engine Unity, stemming from a ham-fisted plan to drastically alter its pricing model for developers.
