I adjusted the database schema today, created posts in the SQL editor, fetched those posts, and jumped through a lot of self-imposed hoops to get it all done and displayed. I generated types, learned a lot about supabase in my research, and am doing my best to learn as much as I can about the tools I'm using.

I'm building a platform for programmers and folks interested in computer science to discuss current tech & programming news, how we can utilize it as programmers, and what it means for us and the software development industry. It's under the same umbrella as the Dev Notes newsletter, which is a newsletter for programmers and folks interested in computer science - but the platform is to foster community and encourage discussion about these topics.
