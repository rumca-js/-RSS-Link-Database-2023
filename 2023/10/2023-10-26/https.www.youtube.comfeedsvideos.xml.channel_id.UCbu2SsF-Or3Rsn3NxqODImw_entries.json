A game with great ambition can be something that reaches high and far, but can also be one that doesn't quite get there. Alan Wake 2 is one of the most ambitious games I've ever played, but don't misconstrue that, as it doesn't fall short of its lofty goals. On the contrary, Alan Wake 2 achieves virtually everything developer Remedy Entertainment set out to do. It's a game that feels novel and risky that is executed with confidence and a clarity of vision. The end result is a one-of-a-kind sequel that redefines its series, blazes trails in video game storytelling, and stands as the monument to a studio that has unlocked its potential to the fullest.\n\nIf you want to read the review check it out here: https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/alan-wake-2-review-a-miracle-illuminated/1900-6418143/\n\n #gaming #alanwake2 #", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6zhG5IfJO4", "date_published": "2023-10-26T13:00:34+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GameSpot - YouTube", "album": "GameSpot - YouTube", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/Z6zhG5IfJO4/hqdefault.jpg"}]
