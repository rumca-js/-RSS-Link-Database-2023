<p>Earlier this month, <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/latest-xbox-accessibility-features-include-controller-pairing-without-touching-the-console-183558285.html">Microsoft announced</a> several upcoming accessibility features for Xbox players. A few of those features, including controller-to-keyboard input remapping, are now live and ready to use. This keyboard mapping feature is particularly significant as it will increase gaming options and improve the overall experience for folks with disabilities. Players will now have the ability to configure the buttons of the Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 and the Xbox Adaptive Controller to match specific keys on their keyboards. Microsoft <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/10/26/xbox-october-update-2023/">says</a> this will help to "expand controller input capabilities in games that have many commands, have limited remapping capabilities, or do not support controllers."</p

<p>Apple has at least one more trick — or possibly a treat — up its sleeve this year. On October 30, the night before Halloween, the company is hosting another event. This one is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-confirms-scary-fast-event-for-the-night-of-october-30-164836214.html">dubbed “Scary Fast,”</a> which is a strong indicator that Apple will have some speedy new hardware to show off. Unusually, Apple is holding this event in the evening. It starts at 8PM ET.</p>
<p>This year's iPhones and Apple Watches are out in the wild already, but Apple has a bunch of other product categories that it could focus on here. There's always the chance that we might get iPad updates. But, if <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-rumored-october-mac-launch-may-happen-after-all-153051265.html">rumors are to be believed</a>, Apple's focus during the Scary Fast event will be on Macs and a fresh batch of chipsets to power them.</p>

<p>Drones aren't new tools for live sports production, but when the World Series begins this Friday, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-07-fox-sports-world-cup-behind-the-scenes.html">Fox Sports</a> will use a fleet of three compact aircraft during the Fall Classic <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/presspass/blog/2023/10/26/fox-sports-steps-up-to-the-plate-for-2023-world-series-presented-by-capital-one/">for the first time ever</a>. Previously, the network used drones during baseball games for coverage of the All-Star and Field of Dreams games. Fox also employs drones for its broadcasts of USFL and first began using them for production in 2015.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the World Series, Fox plans to use the trio of drones to capture moments like relief pitchers coming in from the bullpen, warm-ups between innings and pitchers leaving the mound. The network collaborated with Beverly Hills Aerials on the customized fleet and that company will operate them. While Fox says it will select

<p>Daimler has finally started producing its flagship medium-duty electric truck, <a href="https://northamerica.daimlertruck.com/emobility-media-room/"><ins>the Freightliner eM2</ins></a>, in its manufacturing plant in Portland, Oregon. The company didn't say when its first production units will be available but once they are complete, the vehicles will be delivered to select commercial leasing companies in the US and Canada.</p>
<p>The eM2 is powered by a battery-electric Detroit ePowertrain and is designed with 2-speed transmissions that minimize energy cost per mile. The truck’s driving range will depend on the battery capacity per model. The class 6 single-motor version that has a 194 kWh battery can drive up to 180 miles on a single charge. Alternatively, the class 7 dual-motor which is equipped with a 291 kWh battery can drive up to 250 miles on a single charge.</p>

<p>Threads finally has built-in options for posting GIFs and polls. Meta CEO <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.threads.net/@zuck/post/Cy3m1VnRiwP">Mark Zuckerberg</a> announced the updates on Thursday, replying with his own GIFs and polls to a string of users who’d questioned when these features would come to the platform. Both have begun rolling out for the Threads app and on the web, though polls seems to be taking a bit longer to make its way to the latter.</p>
<p>While users could previously post GIFs using workarounds like third-party keyboards or by copy/pasting them from elsewhere, with mixed results, there was no native button in the app itself. Now, users will see a GIF button in the post creation window next to the image gallery button, which will pull up a searchable GIPHY library to choose from.</p>

<p>Chinese gadget manufacturer Honor just teased its forthcoming flagship smartphone, the Magic 6, at Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Summit. While many details of the phone remain mysterious, the company did announce that it would include built-in eye-tracking and an on-board artificial intelligence powered by a large language model (LLM.)</p>
<p>One of the phone’s key features is something called Magic Capsule, an “eye-tracking based multimodal interaction.” Eye-tracking has some potential real world uses when it comes to smartphones, as the sensors and cameras can perform actions based on where you’re looking. So you can open up an app or engage with content on the phone simply by staring at the right spot.</p>

<p>Respawn Entertainment is adding a long-awaited feature to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/apex-legends/"><em><ins>Apex Legends</ins></em></a>: cross-platform progression. When the new season goes live on October 31, players will see an in-game message that explains how this works. The profile with the highest account level will be designated as their primary account. They'll maintain that level, and all of the cosmetics, achievements and badges from other profiles that are linked to the same EA ID will be merged into the master account. An EA ID is required to play <em>Apex </em>on any platform.</p>
<p>Account merging for cross-progression is mandatory, Respawn said, but it means that those who play the battle royale across multiple platforms will have access to their cosmetic items and currencies no matter where they happen to be playing at a given time. You'll also make progress on the same battle pass whether you're playing on PC, PlayStation, Xbox or Nintendo Switch. Res

<p>Linksys just released its first-ever mesh Wi-Fi 7 router, the Velop Pro 7. It’s powered by the latest Qualcomm Networking Pro 620 platform, which the company says helps it achieve “wire-like stability.” The mesh system can connect up to 200 devices per node and each node offers approximately 3,000 square feet of coverage.</p>
<p>Linksys says these routers use a proprietary technology called Continuous Mesh that continually optimizes the system to match connected devices and increase speed. The company says this makes the Velop Pro 7 particularly useful for gadgets equipped with AR/VR technology, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-quest-3-review-mixed-reality-vr-150009788.html">like the recently-released Meta Quest 3 headset.</a></p>

<p>With concerns around generative AI ever-present, <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/google-ai-security-expansion/">Google has announced an expansion of its Vulnerability Rewards Program (VRP)</a> focused on AI-specific attacks and opportunities for malice. As such, the company released updated guidelines detailing which discoveries qualify for rewards and which fall out of scope. For example, discovering training data extraction that leaks private, sensitive information falls in scope, but if it only shows public, nonsensitive data, then it wouldn't <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-29-google-record-reward-researchers-hack-security-bug-bounty.html">qualify for a reward</a>. Last year, Google gave security researchers $12 million for bug discoveries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Google explained that AI presents different security issues than their other technology — such as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mits-photoguard-protects-your-images-from-malicious-ai-edits-

<p>Every person needs a good home network, but a lot of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-beyond-everywhere-greg-ennis-post-hill-press-143010153.html">domestic Wi-Fi setups</a> suck for countless reasons. Maybe the hardware your ISP gave you isn’t great, or your walls aren’t friendly to wireless signals. Or perhaps the signals from your all-in-one wireless modem and router just can’t reach everywhere from its spot in a far corner of your house. It’s these maladies that mesh systems deal with, a distributed set of smaller Wi-Fi nodes that are spread around your home, pushing internet into every corner. Mesh routers aren’t new, and we’ve reviewed plenty, but now we’re building a one-stop shop for everything you need to know in order to find the best buy for you. That’s because Wi-Fi 6E is mature and affordable enough to offer transformative wireless performance for everyone. After testing a number of systems for connection consistency, dead zones, general ease of use

<p>Meta’s Threads continues to grow, all while the service it aped, X, continues to splutter and fall apart. Mark Zuckerberg said that Threads currently has “just under” <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mark-zuckerberg-threads-has-just-under-100-million-monthly-active-users-222548501.html">100 million monthly active users</a> and that the app could reach 1 billion users in the next couple of years.</p>
<p>Threads picked up 100 million sign-ups in its first week, with easy ways to create an account from your existing Instagram profile. However, engagement dropped off amid complaints about limited functionality and feeds flooded with unwanted posts from brands and users with big audience numbers on Instagram. I was not interested in the piecemeal thoughts of startup execs with a podcast. Shocking, I know.</p>
<p>Meta has since steadily added new features, and engagement seems to have rebounded in recent weeks as Elon Musk continues to make unpopular changes to X, like stripping headli

<p>Spotify's royalty model will get a massive revamp next year to give &quot;working artists&quot; a bigger cut, according to <a href="https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/spotify-is-changing-its-royalty-model-to-crush-streaming-fraud/"><em>Music Business Worldwide</em></a>. Starting in the first quarter of 2024, Spotify will reportedly implement three changes meant to &quot;combat three drains on the royalty pool.&quot; The first one is establishing a minimum number of annual streams a track must reach before it starts generating royalties, which is supposed to demonetize tracks that earn less than 5 cents a month.</p>
<p>Apparently, while these tracks make up a tiny percentage of music on the platform — 99.5 percent of all monetized content will still be earning money after this change — their royalties still cost Spotify tens of millions of dollars a year. Based on <em>Music Business Worldwide's </em>computations, a track has to generate 200 plays a year to be able to earn 5 cen
