After over a decade in the doldrums, with multiple controversies and delays to boot, Star Citizen’s standalone single player experience Squadron 42 looks to be firmly on the horizon. Presented in cinematic interstellar glory via Cloud Imperium Games’ recent I Held the Line deep dive video, prospective players have been treated to glimpses of cosmic traversal, intergalactic cockpit combat, FPS action, plus a host of new tools, weapons, and gadgetry. 

The signs look good for an exceptionally immersive experience, with the narrative supported by a huge cast of well-known Hollywood standard actors including Gillian Anderson, Gary Oldman, Mark Hamill, and Ben Mendelsohn. Here’s hoping CIG’s self-declared polishing phase doesn’t take too long, and we get to see if Squadron 42’s cinematic appearance is as good as it appears in this presentation.

Alan Wake 2 is the newest survival horror title by Remedy, better known for its work on the original Alan Wake, as well as Control. The game puts players in the shoes of FBI agent Saga Anderson who visits Bright Falls to investigate a creepy event. After discovering that the victim was FBI agent Robert Nightingale from the first game, the story kicks things up a notch by interesting incredibly creepy enemies, spooky environments, and the constant feeling that you’re being watched.

The game is also downright gorgeous, making excellent use of light and shadows to hide just enough to let things start feeling spooky. Light quickly becomes the sign of a safe haven, but even permanent light fixtures can often break down. The only real downside to Alan Wake 2 is that those that aren’t familiar with the original’s story might feel a bit lost, especially in its opening hours.

While Stray Souls' Unreal Engine 5-powered visuals look pretty good in stills, everything falls apart with the actual gameplay. Poor story-telling, lackluster horror, dumb AI, awful dialogue, unpolished presentation, dull exploration, repetitive facial animations, terrible "boss" fights - the list goes on, seemingly forever, as Stray Souls finds new ways to insult the player's intelligence.

That's not even accounting for how derivative it can be, taking inspiration from other horror games while taking none of their strengths. Perhaps the only redeeming thing about the experience is how unintentionally hilarious it all is.

Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is an excellent title, whether you're engaging with the story and battling new villains or playing through the multitude of new side content. The combat is incredible, with varying abilities and mechanics like parrying, while some boss battles must be seen to be believed.

However, it's good to stop now and then to enjoy the sheer attention to detail. Ray-traced reflections, character-switching animations, new interactions with NPCs, admiring all the little details in phone conversations - so much extra care has gone into the experience that it's almost mind-boggling (and a little concerning).

Here are 15 incredible details you should know about in Insomniac's open-world superhero title, whether you're scoring for collectibles or testing out the new fall damage setting.
