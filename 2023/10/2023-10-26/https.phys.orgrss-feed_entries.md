To understand the universe, we need to understand the extreme processes that shape it and drive its evolution. Things like supermassive black holes (SMBHs,) supernovae, massive reservoirs of dense gas, and crowds of stars both on and off the main sequence. Fortunately there's a place where these objects dwell in close proximity to one another: the Milky Way's galactic center (GC.)

The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) has always been plagued by uncertainty. With only one habitable planet (Earth) and one technologically advanced civilization (humanity) as examples, scientists are still confined to theorizing where other intelligent life forms could be (and what they might be up to).

## After DART smashed into Dimorphous, what happened to the larger asteroid Didymos?

NASA's DART mission (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) slammed into asteroid Dimorphos in September 2022, changing its orbital period. Ground and space-based telescopes turned to watch the event unfold, not only to study what happened to the asteroid, but also to help inform planetary defense efforts that might one day be needed to mitigate potential collisions with our planet.

Jupiter's Io stands apart from the solar system's other moons, with its numerous volcanoes and its surface dominated by lava flows. Io's surface volcanism was confirmed in 1979 when the Voyager spacecraft imaged it, but its volcanic nature isn't duplicated anywhere else in our system. Tidal heating is behind the moon's eruptive nature, driven by Jupiter's powerful gravity, and by resonance with other moons. But is there a magma ocean inside Io?
