For example, there are three main hand\npositions for promenading:\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/promenade-hand-positions-big.png\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"196\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/promenade-hand-positions.png\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIf the Lark/Gent is used to a Butterfly promenade and puts their right hand\non the Robin/Lady's shoulder, while the Robin/Lady expects a Courtesy\nTurn promenade and puts their right hand behind their back, the dance\ndoesn't flow as well as if they both immediately put their hands in\nthe place the other is expecting.  This means each dance will\ntypically settle into a consensus position.
