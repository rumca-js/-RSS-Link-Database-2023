<p>Grealish to light up the Manchester derby, another record for Salah and Iraola in the last chance saloon?</p><p>With every passing week, Tottenham fans everywhere are telling themselves the same thing: don’t get carried away, enjoy it while you can. Their doubters are mounting up on “told you so” hill, waiting for that inevitable first league defeat of the Ange Postecoglou era. Whether it will come under the Friday night lights at Selhurst Park looks doubtful, though. Crystal Palace remain seriously depleted, without their two key attacking players in Eberechi Eze and Michael Olise. “As far as I’m concerned, they can’t come back quickly enough,” sighed Roy Hodgson, who must instead remind his side of their miserly home defensive record. Palace have kept clean sheets in their past two outings at home, but both were goalless draws against Nottingham Forest and Fulham. Containing Tottenham’s vibrant attacking duo, the smiling assassins Son Heung-min and James Maddison, will be a diff

## João Pedro and Fati fire Brighton to first European victory against ailing Ajax

<p>Brighton gave Ajax a footballing lesson here. Let’s run that again: Brighton, a club that spent 34 years outside the English top flight before their return in 2017, took the inventors of modern football, the mighty Ajax, to school under the floodlights of Falmer. It’s the sort of occasion you’d imagine Brighton fans won’t have difficulty recalling in future, regardless of where this European tour ends up.</p><p>A first half goal from João Pedro was followed shortly after the break by another one from Ansu Fati to wrap this match up. The Seagulls had a couple of other decent chances, too, but their dominance was not truly captured by the scoreline, nor even by the 66% of possession they enjoyed. Instead, the gap between these two sides was marked by the ease with which the hosts went about their work: always composed, always calm, always with the ball under control. This was as true of the centre-half Jan Paul van Hecke as it was of the midfielder Pascal Gross.</p> <a href="https:/

In September, the former speaker Kevin McCarthy made a deal with House Democrats to avoid a government shutdown.

Shaft, his big-screen debut, begins with Roundtree emerging from the subway and striding confidently on to New York’s 42nd street on a wintry morning. Neatly groomed afro, moustache and sideburns, smart suit, polo neck and long, tailored leather coat. The hi-hats and wah-wah guitar of Isaac Hayes’ funky theme tune get going. Long-distance cameras track him from high above and close cameras frame him heroically from below. He struts through the bustling streets as if he owns the place, surveying the scene, jaywalking and stopping the traffic, flipping the bird at yellow cabs, stopping to engage with local characters. It’s like Roundt

Some of the 15 works included are concert staples – Franck’s Le Chasseur Maudit, Paul Dukas’ L’Apprenti Sorcier, Emmanuel Chabrier’s España, Camille Saint-Saëns’s Danse Macabre – but many of the other composers represented here are forgotten now.</p><p>Stylistically they are a highly varied bunch: there are still traces of Berlioz in Ernest Guiraud’

It was a Steadicam shot, so everyone had to be acting all the time because you don’t know where the camera is looking. It was about a six-minute take where everyone was going for it in this big room. Then they go, “Cut!”, everyone stops, then someone says: “OK, go for another take.” I was with the wonderful Emily Woof and just had to get very intimate, very quickly.

Densely packed houses stretch to the horizon below a visible halo of pollution. The streets are busy at all hours, with people eating, drinking, talking, getting haircuts and buying and selling anything and everything. Nigeria’s biggest city is complex, diverse and unequal, but all over it, the same music vibrates: at any hour, the world-conquering sound of Afrobeats pours out of cars, bars, windows and parks.</p><p>In the northern suburb of Ikeja, tucked away amid warehouses and factories, is the home of that sound, the New Afrika Shrine. This cavernous auditorium, with its corrugated metal roof and walls drained of their colour by years of humidity, is a reincarnation of the musical home of Fela Kuti, whose Afrobeat s

<p>Casting Izzard as billionaire scientist Nina, a new incarnation for the classic story’s tormented hero, proves less intriguing than it sounds</p><p>There’s something initially intriguing in this gender-flipped take on Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde from the rebooted Hammer studio brand, starring Eddie Izzard as Dr Nina Jekyll. But it soon reveals itself as bafflingly laborious, leaden and self-conscious, with the star often going into the familiar quirky monologue-riffing style, which might be hilarious in Izzard’s standup comedy, but it’s weird in the wrong way here.</p><p>The comedy in the central performance feels unsettled, undermining the film’s horror potential, which is in any case damaged by the over-egged musical score and misfiring jump non-scares. The legendary dual personae of the story are not interestingly differentiated, or really differentiated at all, both being very much Izzard.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/oct/26/doctor-jekyll-review-eddie-izzard-in

<p>Twenty years after watching LeBron James make his NBA debut from press row, our correspondent returns to watch the most hyped teenage prospect in a generation </p><p>In October 2003, I flew to Sacramento, California, to watch LeBron James play his first pro basketball game. Even at 18 his physical presence was incredibly impressive. I wrote at the time (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/nov/30/ussport.features1">for this paper</a>) that most tall men look etiolated, like the normal amount of human material has been stretched too thin. LeBron by contrast looked like a statue of a normal person – not just taller, but substantially more solid. The scouting report suggested that his jump shot was still shaky, and I noticed him missing short in the pre-game warm-ups. There seemed to be a hitch in his stroke, a kind of hesitation; he leaned back a little on the release. Then the game started and this teenage kid playing with grown men swished his first three mid-range jump

<p>Placenta encapsulation has become a mini-industry in the US, amid questions over its safety and benefits</p><p>Callie Landis makes a living dehydrating placentas for new moms to eat. As founder of <a href="https://www.lancasterplacentaco.com/">Lancaster Placenta Company</a>, a lab in her Pennsylvania hometown, she takes the organs moms send her and turns them into capsules, tinctures, and balms. She’s most proud of her placenta gummy bears. “They’re pink and glittery,” Landis said. “That encompasses womanhood through and through.”</p><p>No one doubts that the placenta keeps a fetus healthy. The organ attaches to the uterus, delivering nutrients via the umbilical cord, and gets delivered shortly after the baby. But evangelists of placenta-eating can easily rattle off a list of the practices’s supposed benefits for the mother after birth, too: they say it aids in breast milk production, reduces the effects of postpartum depression, and helps with general postnatal<strong> </strong>h

<p>Researchers are at last revealing how slavery and the slave trade shaped the country’s institutions</p><p>On 27 July 1825, a brig called Espadarte (Swordfish) docked in Rio de Janeiro and unloaded its expensive cargo: 422 Africans forcibly shipped across the Atlantic from Angola. It was the first slave shipment known to have been organised by José Bernardino de Sá, then a clerk at a Rio trading house.</p><p>Over the following 25 years, undeterred by a law that theoretically made the slave trade illegal in 1831, Sá would be responsible for trafficking at least 19,000 Africans to Brazil – and become one of the empire’s richest men in the process. By the time of his death in 1855, Sá was a viscount who owned countless buildings in Rio, a handful of rural properties on the south-eastern coast, three ships and more shares in the Banco do Brasil than any other individual.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/26/brazil-slavery-reparations-slave-trade-banco-do-brasil">C

<p>Forget Chris Waddle – the 18th-century dandy Beau Nash should be this season’s style icon</p><p>I could see there was something significant going on with this lad’s hair. Max, 13, had plainly gone to some trouble with it. His mum and dad, old friends of mine, clocked my quizzical look. “He wants a mullet and this is the closest we’ve let him get to it,” his mum said. Max explained that even getting this far on the road to full mullet had demanded some subterfuge on his part – a conspiracy, in fact, between him and the barber.</p><p>What happened was this: knowing his mum was watching him like a hawk, he asked the barber for a “low taper”. I don’t know what that is, but the barber did. This was a wink to the wise. “I know what you really want is a mullet,” she whispered to him. And minutes later, to his mother’s dismay, this new semi-mullet was getting its first outing on the streets of Chislehurst. Nice work, son.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/oct/26/

<p>An author takes refuge in the desert in this hallucinatory tale of grief, sex addiction and a magical cactus</p><p>Surreal is a word often used to describe Melissa Broder’s fiction, and there is a bounty of surrealism on display in her third novel Death Valley, especially for a reader coming to her work for the first time. It’s important, however, to acknowledge the realism and world building that set the stage for much of the fantastical elements that come later. Death Valley is a modern fairytale about a Los Angeles writer who seeks refuge and creative inspiration in the desert while her father fights for his life after a car crash. Death hovers, and drapes the delicate psyche of our protagonist’s mind at every turn with bleak, obsessive and self-absorbed thoughts. She is hoping big skies, arid desert plains and a Best Western motel will shift her into a better headspace, and give her courage to face her father’s imminent death and her husband’s mysterious chronic illness.

While my school peers were mimicking Keanu and dodging invisible bullets, whispers reverberated around the playground of a PlayStation game that was somehow even cooler.

<p>A new compilation of work by female producers honours the women fighting for their rights in Iran in the wake of Mahsa Zhina Amini’s death in police custody</p><p>In September 2022, Mahsa Zhina Amini died after being arrested by Iran’s “morality police”, for allegedly wearing her hijab improperly. Authorities claimed she had a heart attack and brain seizure, but witnesses to her arrest said she was a victim of police brutality. The uprising sparked by her death was the largest Iranian civil rights movement since the revolution in 1979, as thousands took the streets and were often met with violent subjugation from the country’s authorities.</p><p>More than a year has now passed, and the ubiquitous chants of <em>“Zan, Zendegi, Azadi”</em> (meaning “woman, life, freedom” in Persian) have seeped from the streets of Iran into the works of female Iranian electronic artists – literally so in the case of Azadi.MP3, whose track Empty Platform is filled with chants of those protests alongsi

<p>The author’s meticulous reconstruction of a fatal accident in the West Bank allows us to see the region’s injustices afresh</p><p>The conflict between Israelis and Palestinians has reached a new, horrific pitch. But even after Hamas’s surprise attack on 7 October, massacring more than 1,400 Israeli civilians and taking nearly 200 hostage – and the inevitable, lethal Israeli response – a challenge confronts writers on this topic. Put simply, the underlying conflict is stuck in a deadlock that has come to seem permanent: how, then, to write a book that does not repeat scores of previous accounts, that does not itself sound like a stuck record?</p><p>Nathan Thrall, a former official of the International Crisis Group, has found an answer. Despite his résumé, he has not written an analysis or policy document, still less a 10-point peace plan, but rather a compelling work of nonfiction, a book that is by turns deeply affecting and, in its concluding chapters, as tense as a thriller.</p>

<p>Managerless and sitting in the Eredivisie relegation zone, the Dutch club have big problems to solve on and off the field </p><p>Ajax are a complete mess. The Dutch club are preparing for their crucial Europa League trip to Brighton against the backdrop of their biggest crisis in decades.

<p>A gripping semi-historical imagining of the memories and experiences of a French naturalist in 18th-century Africa</p><p>Readers of David Diop’s previous novel, which won the International Booker prize and already feels like a classic of war fiction, probably won’t have forgotten the experience. At Night All Blood Is Black is narrated by a young Senegalese soldier recruited to fight for France in the first world war and brutalised in the trenches. Visceral horror, incantatory language and delicate thinking were welded in its slender form. Now Diop has brought his capacious mind to bear on an earlier period of encounter between Europe and Africa. Beyond the Door of No Return is the story of a French Enlightenment botanist who travels to Senegal to study plants and finds himself overwhelmed by love for an African woman.</p><p>Michel Adanson is an old man by the time he writes this tale of passion in a leatherbound journal, hoping that his daughter will find and read it.

As the war cry on both sides intensified, a young Albert Einstein, together with the astronomer Wilhelm Foerster, physiologist Georg Friedrich Nicolai and philosopher Otto Buek, signed a <a href="https://caltechletters.org/science/approaching-a-genius">Manifesto to the Europeans</a>, inviting scholars and artists, “those of whom one should expect such convictions”, to speak against the escalation, think in terms of a common culture, transcend nationalist passions and call for a “union of Europeans” to prevent Europe from perishing in a “fratricidal war”. Few listened. Europe sank into the catastrophes of the two world wars, which led to the end of its pre-eminence.</p><p>We are in a similar situation now. This time i

## Retribution review – Liam Neeson on Taken-style autopilot in car-bomb action thriller

<p>Until now the UK’s short growing season has made it too difficult to grow haricot beans</p><p>Is there a finer, more British meal than good old fashioned baked beans on toast? Even though they are a staple of the British diet – about 2m cans are consumed in the UK each day – the haricot beans they are made from have been far too difficult to grow in Britain because the growing season is too short, with cold springs and wet autumns. Instead, the beans are made from imported haricot beans grown in warmer climates such as North America, Ethiopia and China.</p><p>But now the first commercial crop of homegrown haricot beans has been harvested recently at a farm in Lincolnshire, after 12 years of development at the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/baked-beans-could-grown-britain-30252834">University of Warwick</a>.

They were convinced that JFK’s son, John F Kennedy Jr, was about to return, to take his place as vice-president alongside a reinstated Donald Trump, to battle the satanic paedophile cabal that had taken over Washington. Some even waved “Trump-Kennedy 2024” banners. Never mind that JFK Jr died in a plane crash in 1999: these people were credulous enough to believe the QAnon conspiracy theory.</p><p>When JFK Jr failed to materialise, they promised he would appear at the Rolling Stones’ concert in Dallas that night.
