Amazon&#8217;s cost-cutting moves over the past year, including thousands of layoffs and tightening of its fulfillment network, appear to be helping&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/amazon-stock-rises-after-beating-q3-estimates-with-143-1b-in-revenue-9-9b-in-profits/">Read More</a>

Omnidian&#8217;s software remotely detects performance issues for solar installations. The company has customers in 34 states. Solar installations are on the rise in the U.S., driven in part by support from the Inflation Reduction Act. A recent study concluded that solar power may have crossed a tipping point leading to continued, accelerated installation. It predicts that solar will provide 56% of electricity production by 2050.

The complaint, filed Wednesday in federal court in Seattle, alleges that Convoy violated a federal law passed in 1988 known as the&#160;Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act. The law aims to protect workers by typically requiring either a written warning at least 60 days before a layoff, or 60 days of severance if advanced notice is not provided, for companies with 100 or more full-time employees.

Should we refer to this robot as he or she? As it turns out, the answer was neither. &#8220;We use it for Digit,&#8221; said Damion Shelton, the CEO and co-founder of the Corvallis, Ore.-based company. Agility used she for its prior robot, Cassie, but ultimately decided it wasn&#8217;t right to assign a gender to a piece of technology. It might seem like a trivial distinction, but it was a relevant question to&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/getting-to-know-digit-the-humanoid-robot-that-amazon-just-started-testing-for-warehouse-work/">Read More</a>

However, in my journey, I discovered that what seems like the end could be an opportunity in disguise. If your startup isn’t gaining the traction you hoped for, it might be time to pivot or even sell. Believe me, there&#8217;s light at the end of the tunnel.
