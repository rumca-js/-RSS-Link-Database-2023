		Technology companies specializing in compact, energy-efficient edge computing devices are actively working to enhance their devices' capabilities to enable visual perception in machines for applications like facial recognition. Typically, visual perception demands significant computational resources when deployed remotely on edge devices, leading to reduced latency and the ability to make real-time decisions.

Historically, the conventional use of deep learning and machine learning neural hardware, along with GPUs, has shown inefficiency in terms of energy consumption, especially when deployed near the network edge where data originates.

In response to this challenge, neuromorphic computing emerged as a solution, offering a form of artificial intelligence

In the wake of the global pandemic, the distribution of vital funds to citizens worldwide became a critical endeavor. However this noble cause also became a breeding ground for fraudulent activities. FinCEN Identity Project recently reported that in 2022 over 600,000 suspicious activity reports (SARs) were tied to fraudulent identity records, calling this the “big money grab” and one of the largest fraud events in history to date. And fraud is only on the rise.
