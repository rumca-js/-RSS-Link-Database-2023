  <p id="sUSlil">Fighting against data used to train AI models has become more poisonous. </p>
<p id="FTvUuY">A new tool called Nightshade allows users to attach it to their creative work, and it will corrupt — or poison —  training data using that art. Eventually, it can ruin future models of AI art platforms like DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney, removing its ability to create images.</p>
<p id="pTQzWe">Nightshade adds invisible changes to pixels in a piece of digital art. When the work is ingested by a model for training, the “poison” exploits a security vulnerability that confuses the model, so it will no longer read an image of a car as a car and come up with a cow instead. </p>

  <p id="aSJgOH">Like many instructors, Janani Umamaheswar occasionally checks Rate My Professors to monitor her course reviews. The site offers a loose barometer of how you are doing as a teacher, especially early in a career in academia. Since users post anonymously, including criticisms and rants, the site can also become a fount of anxiety. </p>
<p id="F96E5X">When negative reviews do appear, any professor might speculate: <em>How often are people checking my page? Could this reflect poorly on my future employment?</em> And in particular, <em>who</em> posted the criticism? They might run down the mental list of students who received low grades or did not get a requested extension or rarely spoke in class. They might wonder if a user is even a former student or if the

  <p id="5JQjn6">Intel’s latest 14th Gen chips <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23918907/intel-core-i9-14900k-review">aren’t a huge improvement</a> over the 13th Gen in gaming performance, but a new Intel Application Optimization (APO) feature might just change that. Intel’s new APO app simply runs in the background, improving performance in games. It offers impressive boosts to frame rates in games that support it, like <em>Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege</em> and <em>Metro Exodus</em>. </p>
