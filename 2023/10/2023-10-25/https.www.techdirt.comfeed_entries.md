There were electronic transactions over networks that pre-dated this (such as on proprietary online services like CompuServe, but [&#8230;]

Civil asset forfeiture allows law enforcement to bypass most of the Constitution so long as they imply things about the supposedly illegal source of the property they&#8217;ve taken from citizens.

A few people have been asking me about last week’s release of something called the “Westminster Declaration,” which is a high and mighty sounding “declaration” about freedom of speech, signed by a bunch of journalists, academics, advocates and more. It reminded me a lot of the infamous “Harper’s Letter” from a few years ago that [&#8230;]

The TSA was imposed on us following the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Supposedly necessitated by this &#8220;new&#8221; terrorist threat, the TSA shrugged into action, becoming another layer of irritating bureaucracy standing between benign travelers and their freedom of movement. Since then, it has gotten worse. The TSA has spent billions on tech, training, [&#8230;]

I really wish we could fast forward a few decades to the point where we look back on the moral panic over kids and social media and laugh about it, the same way we now laugh about similar moral panics regarding television, Dungeons &#38; Dragons, rock &#38; roll music, comic books, pinball, chess, novels, and [&#8230;]

So we&#8217;ve been talking a lot about how as the streaming video market matures, it&#8217;s increasingly behaving a lot like the old, shitty cable companies the sector once disrupted.
