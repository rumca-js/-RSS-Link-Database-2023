There’s a new documentary coming to HBO entitled David Holmes: The Boy Who Lived, documenting the story of David Holmes, a teenage gymnast who served as the stunt double for Daniel Radcliffe in the first 6 Harry Potter films. That is until he tragically suffered a spinal injury on set that left him paralyzed. The countdown for Attack on Titan’s last episode begins, and there’s a Blacula remake in the works.

When brothers Pedro (Ezequiel Rodríguez) and Jimmy (Demián Salomón) discover that a demonic infection has been festering in a nearby farmhouse — its very proximity poisoning the local livestock — they attempt to evict the victim from their land.

Failing to adhere to the proper rites of exorcism, their reckless actions inadvertently trigger an epidemic of possessions across their rural community. Now they must outrun an encroaching evil as it corrupts and mutilates everyone it is exposed to, and enlist the aid of a wizened “cleaner,” who holds the only tools that can stop this supernatural plague.

A wildly original take on the possession film, When Evil Lurks is a shocking supernatural thriller from Argentine master of horror, writer-director Demián Rugna (Terrified).

IFC Films will release in theaters on October 6th. Available to stream on Shudder on October 27th.

Chris Pine (who plays King Magnifico) performs "This Is The Thanks I Get?!" from Disney's Wish, an upcoming musical comedy film. Wish also features the voices of Ariana DeBose as Asha and Alan Tudyk as Asha’s favorite goat, Valentino.

Walt Disney Animation Studios’ Wish is an all-new musical-comedy welcoming audiences to the magical kingdom of Rosas, where Asha, a sharp-witted idealist, makes a wish so powerful that it is answered by a cosmic force—a little ball of boundless energy called Star. Together, Asha and Star confront a most formidable foe—the ruler of Rosas, King Magnifico—to save her community and prove that when the will of one courageous human connects with the magic of the stars, wondrous things can happen. 

The film is helmed by director Chris Buck (“Frozen,” “Frozen 2”) and Fawn Veerasunthorn (“Raya and the Last Dragon”), and produced by Peter Del Vecho (“Frozen,” “Frozen 2”) and Juan Pablo Reyes Lancaster Jones (“Encanto”).

Are we sure Spider Man isn't killing people in Spider Man 2? Both Spider-Men claim to not be into the whole murdering thing. They may present themselves as innocent young men, and enjoy nothing more than water-skiing and photographing frisbee players, but are we really sure that Peter Parker and Miles Morales aren’t just stone-cold killers? At the very least dozens and dozens of lives are being ruined. Here’s too many times that the Spider-Men caused major bodily harm in this Spider Man 2 gameplay.

Spoilers for The Flame mission in Marvel's Spider-Man 2!

After playing through the four-part side mission The Flame in Spider-Man 2, you're probably wondering who is the mysterious leader known as the Flame, and we have the answer for you. As it was revealed in the final chapter of The Flame quest, the leader is none other than Cletus Kasady aka Carnage. Between his psychotic ramblings, red hair, and the fact that he just made off with a red symbiote, it's safe to say that The Flame is the man who will soon become Carnage. But will Spider-Man 2 have DLC? We think so! Much like the first game setup its DLC story in a side quest, we think the same will happen here with Carnage taking center stage in a new Spider-Man 2 DLC story.
