GeekWire calculated the new employment number based on Microsoft CFO Amy Hood&#8217;s statement on the company&#8217;s earnings conference call Tuesday that Microsoft&#8217;s headcount was down 7% year-over-year. Although the company didn&#8217;t give a new employment count as part of the earnings report, we used historical figures and prior disclosures to arrive at the number.

The apparent deal could mean that some of the company&#8217;s workforce would remain employed, following Convoy&#8217;s surprising shutdown last week. The Seattle startup laid off 533 employees as part of a closure, according to a new update on Tuesday from Washington’s Employment Security Department. In a video call with employees last week, Convoy President Mark Okerstrom said the company was still “exploring strategic options” with potential acquirers.

Maybe not 100 million degrees Celsius &#8212; which is the sort of mind-blowing temperature needed to make this futuristic power source possible &#8212; but the industry is sizzling. Fusion energy could provide a nearly infinite source of carbon-free power and help save the planet from climate change. Companies in the Pacific Northwest and elsewhere are raking in billions to pursue the dream with investments from tech heavyweights such as Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Despite the financial momentum, and headline-grabbing scientific breakthroughs, huge hurdles remain. In fact, no fusion company&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/fusion-fever-a-reality-check-on-the-multibillion-dollar-race-to-reinvent-energy-and-save-the-planet/">Read More<

Investor sentiment for Amazon is &#8220;mixed,&#8221; according to a report from Wedbush last week. In addition to AWS and AI, the company could also be facing retail margin pressure due to rising oil prices and is dealing with ongoing competition from Chinese companies such as Temu and TIkTok Shop, Wedbush said in its report. The company&#8217;s stock has underperformed the larger market and other mega-cap tech names since its second&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/amazon-earnings-preview-aws-growth-and-ai-strategy-in-the-spotlight/">Read More</a>

But as consumer electronics continue to evolve and choices multiply, he felt the product research process was growing overly complex, and existing online resources were just not keeping pace. &#8220;Shopping for complicated products is too difficult and time-consuming for people,&#8221; said Golden, who previously co-founded a photo product site called Collage that was acquired in 2021. &#8220;Ultimately, I saw lots of people not ending up with the right product for themselves because of these difficulties.&#8221;&#8230; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/ai-product-recommendation-startup-wants-to-become-the-starting-point-for-shopping-online/">Read More</a>
