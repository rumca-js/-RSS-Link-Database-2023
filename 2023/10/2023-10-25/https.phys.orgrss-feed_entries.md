When targeting problem proteins involved in causing or spreading disease, a drug will often clog up a protein's active site so it can't function and wreak havoc. New strategies for dealing with these proteins can send these proteins to different types of cellular protein degradation machinery such as a cell's lysosomes, which act like a protein wood chipper.

## Chaotic jumble of merging spiral galaxies hints at possible fate of Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies

The swirling arms of a spiral galaxy are among the most recognized features in the cosmos: long sweeping bands spun off from a central core, each brimming with dust, gas, and dazzling pockets of newly formed stars. Yet this opulent figure can warp into a much more bizarre and amorphous shape during a merger with another galaxy. The same sweeping arms are suddenly perturbed into disarray, and two supermassive black holes at their respective centers become entangled in a tidal dance. This is the case of NGC 7727, a peculiar galaxy located in the constellation of Aquarius about 90 million light-years from the Milky Way.

A timer option is a financial instrument, launched by Société Générale Corporate and Investment Banking in 2007, that allows buyers to specify the level of volatility and allows them to exercise their option at a random maturity time. In other words, the payoff of the timer option depends only on a random date determined by the time needed to realize a prescribed variance budget for the underlying asset. This is contrary to vanilla options, which are always exercised at a fixed, predetermined price within a given timeframe.

Most people will agree that over the past several years, American political leaders have been saying—and sharing on social media—unusual things that politicians would never have said a decade or two ago. At times, their words can seem out of character for what a leader should typically say and can even appear antidemocratic in nature.

The work leveraged networks of thousands of acoustic receivers that tracked 200 tarpon over more than five years. One of the key findings is that there are two distinct subgroups of tarpon, which has immediate implications for efforts to conserve the fish, known to anglers as the "Silver King."

The use of whistleblowing to challenge teacher absence in the developing world is worth considering, but its effectiveness can be dampened by offering monetary rewards for reporting absent colleagues, according to a field experiment conducted by Stefano Fiorin (Bocconi Laboratory for Effective Anti-Poverty Policies and Department of Economics) with the collaboration of the Afghan Ministry of Education. "Moral aversion to being paid for harming others can reverse the effect of financial incentives," explains Fiorin in the fourth video of the LEAP Talks series.

And they will hardly be alone. Alongside NASA's Artemis Program, the European Space Agency also plans to send astronauts to the moon and establish a permanent habitat there (the Moon Village), while China and Russia are working toward creating the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS). Numerous commercial space companies will also be there to provide crew transportation, cargo, and logistical services.

A model examines farmers' profits and the health and environmental costs of growing corn in the US Midwest, where about 20% of the world's corn is grown. Corn farming involves applying fertilizer or manure to provide the crop with nitrogen, a vital nutrient. But around half of the nitrogen added to fields never makes it into the crop, and instead enters the environment, either through the air or the water.

Modern physics can explain everything from the spin of the tiniest particle to the behavior of entire galaxy clusters. But it can't explain life. There's simply no formula to explain the difference between a living lump of matter and a dead one. Life seems to just mysteriously "emerge" from non-living parts, such as elementary particles.

With male infertility a mounting global concern impacting approximately 12% of men, according to the National Institutes of Health, a Penn State research team has discovered a gene that plays a key role in initiating and sustaining spermatogenesis. The finding, they said, may open a door for future therapies to boost sperm counts.

Lead optimization in drug discovery is a challenging process that heavily relies on hypotheses and the experience of medicinal chemists. This often leads to uncertain outcomes and inefficiency. Furthermore, the process is time-consuming and requires significant resources. Therefore, the introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) predictive tools to accelerate this process would be highly valuable in the field of drug discovery.

By analyzing deep optical imagery from the IAC Stripe 82 Legacy Project, an international team of astronomers has serendipitously discovered a new almost dark galaxy. The newfound galaxy, dubbed "Nube," has a very low surface brightness and is as massive as the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The finding is reported in a paper published October 18 on the pre-print server arXiv.

Trees isolate carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, benefit wildlife, and biodiversity and make us humans happy. Perhaps you're lucky enough to have trees in your backyard, outside your window, or in a nearby park. Forests aren't the only place where foliage enriches the planet. But until now, we have simply not been able to account for all the many trees not in forests, according to new research from the University of Copenhagen's Department of Geosciences and Natural Resource Management.
