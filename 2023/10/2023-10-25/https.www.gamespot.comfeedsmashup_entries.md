Though, as with all things, it took some effort to adapt nearly a decade of lore and turn the heavy subject matter of these games into a family-friendly PG-13 movie.</p><p dir="ltr">The Five Nights at Freddy's movie has been in the works nearly since the first game, in which you play a security guard who must survive a night in a decrepit Chuck E Cheese knock-off where the animatronics try to eat you, came out way back in 2014.

Even lapsed fans who haven't regularly watched the show in decades still tune in to watch the newest Treehouse.</p><p dir="ltr">The Treehouse episodes are special because they are non-canon, which means the writers can experiment or try something wild. Regular characters can die, often in bloody, gruesome ways. What's more, the episodes are presented as an anthology, with each Treehouse of Horror containing multiple shorter stories. And many of the annual specials, especially late in the series' run, are considered the best of their respective seasons. That's especially true for the recent Treehouse of Horror XXXIII, which was arguably the best Simpsons Halloween episode in decades.</p><p dir="lt

Not Metroid though, as Nintendo's action-packed video game series has a timeless design that mixes high-tech powersuits with alien worlds that look as good today as they did decades ago.

<p>Woody from Toy Story has come to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2/">Red Dead Redemption II</a> in an incredible fan-made video. YouTube user eli_handle_b.wav, who has wowed us with their creations before like Michael Scott in Mass Effect, is back to show us what Andy's favorite toy would look like in Rockstar's western.</p><p>In the amazing video, we see Woody strolling through a saloon, playing dead to avoid a bear (and then getting trampled by said bear), roasting Micah for being "trash," and eventually giving Micah a proper beating. It's very well made, and also tonally jarring given Toy Story is a family friendly, lighthearted series, and Red Dead Redemption is... not. Woody is a cowboy, though, so it's a natural crossover in some respects.</p><p>Check out the full video below, and be sure to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@eli_handle_bwav">visit eli_handle_b.wav's YouTube page</a> to see their other fantastic videos, like this one of <a href="ht
