		Australia’s upcoming digital identity system should allow its users to decide what sort of data they wish to share, says former New South Wales minister Victor Dominello.

Dominello was recently named as the chair of a new advisory body focused on its national digital identity system, the federal Ministerial Digital ID Expert Panel. Known for his role in steering the NSW Digital ID project, Dominello will be tasked with providing advice on building the Australian digital ID, <a href="https://www.innovationaus.com/experts-to-guide-lagging-digital-id-program/">according</a> to trade publication InnovationAus.

		Rare is the move made by Worldcoin Foundation or its founder Sam Altman that does not leave a non-zero percentage of intelligent people wondering, WTF?

<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/worldcoin">Worldcoin</a> exists to encourage all of humankind to be cryptocurrency users and, to make that happen, it collects the irises of people to create reliable and, one hopes, secure digital IDs.

This week, organization announced it is changing how it rewards the people who collect irises using a Worldcoin device called orbs. They had been awarded a so-called stablecoin, a cryptocurrency created to avoid the vertiginous swings typical of the market. Now they will be compensated with WLD, Worldcoin's cryptocurrency.

Why? Not clear.
