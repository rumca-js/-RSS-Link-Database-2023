<p>The Australian’s remarkable World Cup century from just 40 balls against the Netherlands was in all senses an extraordinary knock</p><p>Sometimes, all you need are the numbers. Glenn Maxwell made the fastest World Cup century, taking 40 balls. He arrived in the middle for the first ball of the 40th over. In all List A cricket, it was the latest start in an innings for any player to score a hundred. And it took nine balls of that span for him to first get on strike.</p><p>He took 27 balls to go past 50, then 13 to pass a hundred. That last baker’s dozen included two dots and three singles. All up the match saw nine overs bowled between Maxwell facing his first ball and being caught for 106. Australia went from meandering towards 300 to posting 399, on to win by 309. It was in all senses extraordinary.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/oct/26/glenn-maxwell-tears-up-cricket-history-books-with-innings-of-riotous-expression">Continue reading...</a>

Twice they hit back at Celtic. The Spanish team may feel they should have gone further given second-half territorial dominance but Celtic contributed enough to a pulsating contest to deserve their point.

<p>Play forward, on the front foot, take risks, be brave; all the things trumpeted by Birmingham City’s top brass as reasons to be cheerful about a new, ambitious era led by Wayne Rooney and fronted by Tom Brady. All of those things were on show in Rooney’s first home game in charge, the only problem being those buzzwords were exhibited best not by Birmingham but Hull. Liam Delap and Jaden Philogene, two of the most exciting players in the Championship, got the goals, Philogene’s a peach from distance, killing the game.</p><p>After all the pre-match pyrotechnics and fireworks, Rooney’s rather understated entrance fell flat. His first visit to St Andrew’s, in 2002, ended with him being sent off for Everton, aged 17, for a lunge on Steve Vickers 15 minutes after entering and this proved another visit to largely forget, with away supporters basking in Birmingham’s pending defeat approaching full time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/25/wayne-rooneys-birmingham

So how is it going to do that? How do you tell Hamas militants from non-combatants? How do you know Hamas military locations from civilian buildings?</p><p>The answer is that you can’t. A terrorist organisation is made up of civilians who wish to fight, and they can move between being combatants and civilians at will. The locations used by terrorists can change all the time. Thus a state waging a war against a terrorist organisation can never win using military means alone.

He died this week at 78, still the club chairman, in the job he loved – even if it had brought him untold trouble and disappointment. No trophy was lifted during his almost 20 years in the chair, though he had been on the club’s board when the FA Cup – Joe Royle, Joe Parkinson, Paul Rideout and all that – was won in 1995. There were the David Moyes years, too, 11 years when Everton, routinely cash-strapped, always punched above their weight and became a model for solidity, endeavour and a tight bond between fans and players. “The people’s club,” they called it, a knowing nod to that more globalised, corporate lot across Stanley Park.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/25/bill-kenwright-everton-football-dail

Macdonald, Monica Dolan and Carol Morley relive the hectic shoot that turned her amazing life into a quirky road movie</p><p>Audrey Amiss was the talented daughter of Sunderland shopkeepers who made a splash in the press by winning a place at the Royal Academy’s schools in London. In her final term, she was hospitalised for the first of many mental breakdowns, after which she disappeared for 30 years into a job as a shorthand typist in the civil service. But unknown to anyone except those who tried to care for her, Amiss never gave up on her art. “I was once in the tradition of social realism, also called the kitchen sink school of painting,” she wrote. “But I am now avant garde and misunderstood.”</p><p>Film-maker Carol Morley had never heard of Amiss until she was awarded a screenwriting fellowship at the Wellcome Foundation medical charity. “Somebody said, ‘We’ve got the archive of a wom

So, via the world wide web, my friend booked himself a parking space at Wrexham’s B&amp;Q, 2pm to 6pm, three quid. Up he parked, walked to the ground, and watched his team come back from 2-0 down to win 3-2. Nice work all round. The following morning, still warming in the afterglow of this famous victory, he received an email from the online parking app provider inviting him to, believe it or not

But I suspect that Savage Waters is not the surfing doc that director Mikey Corker set out to make. The story begins when Matt Knight, a sailor and surfer in his 50s, reads a book written by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/nov/28/weatherwatch-ef-knight-sails-storm-trinidad">Victorian adventurer EF Knight</a> (no relation): an account of an 1890s voyage to find Spanish gold rumoured to buried in the rocks of the Savage Islands, a small Portuguese archipelago in the North Atlantic.

Addressing 2,500 people at New York’s Hunter College one June night in 1983, Maurice Bishop won the crowd over with ease, covering everything from the Palestinian struggle to Ronald Reagan’s Medicaid cuts. At one point, the 39-year-old prime minister of Grenada described a “secret report” from the US state department warning that the revolution he fronted was even worse for US interests than the Cuban and Nicaraguan ones.</p><p>Why? Because its leaders were young, Black, socialist and, most crucially, English-speaking. The thousands of people who chanted: “Forward ever!

<p>The Moneyball author develops a misguided soft spot for fallen crypto king Sam Bankman-Fried</p><p>There is a suspense embedded in Michael Lewis’ account of the rise and fall of Sam Bankman-Fried that makes an already fascinating book more delicious. As followers of the collapse of the crypto king’s empire will know, halfway through the writing of the book, the author’s task changed dramatically from profiling one of the world’s youngest billionaires to charting his spectacular implosion. Bankman-Fried’s cryptocurrency exchange, FTX, is bankrupt and he is now appearing in a Manhattan federal court on multiple charges of fraud. In Going Infinite, the suspense is less rooted in whether or not he is guilty than whether Lewis will ever stop being so thoroughly charmed by him.</p><p>I should say here that I love Michael Lewis. As with all of his writing – with the exception of a toe-curling profile he did of President Obama for Vanity Fair 11 years ago – Going Infinite is insanely read

<p>A 17-year-old with a passion for robotics has produced a cheaper utensil that uses sensors to cancel out hand tremors</p><p>The motivation for his invention came to Aarrav Anil last year when he saw his uncle Arjun, who has Parkinson’s disease, struggle to eat. Some food spilled out of his mouth, the rest splattered on his clothes. Arjun attempted to keep his dignity but the frustration forced the retired civil servant, who is in his 70s, to give up and call his helper to feed him.</p><p>The sight of his uncle’s tremors shaking the spoon so violently inspired Aarrav, 17, from Bengalaru, south India, to turn to robotics. He locked himself in his room with microcontrollers, sensors, motors, and a 3D printer. What emerged was a prototype of a smart spoon that is now undergoing trials at the RV College of Physiotherapy in Bengalaru.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/oct/25/indian-schoolboy-invents-affordable-smart-spoon-for-trembling-hands">Continue read

<p>Analysis of Burgess Shale-like rocks reveal certain types of clay increase chances of soft-bodied fossil preservation</p><p>When did the first animals appear on Earth? If the fossil record is to be believed, the first animals evolved about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jul/03/explosion-of-life-on-earth-linked-to-heavy-metal-act-at-planets-centre">570m years ago</a> and proliferated rapidly during the Cambrian explosion, approximately 539m to 485m years ago. But if you follow the molecular clock, which uses the rate at which genes accumulate mutations to extrapolate living animals back to their oldest common ancestor, animals probably first evolved about 800m years ago.</p><p>Now researchers have taken a different approach and asked when were conditions right for preserving animal fossils? The first animals are thought to have lacked mineral-based shells or skeletons, and would have needed exceptional conditions to be fossilised, akin to the famous 500m-year-old

Then the climate crisis forced them to adapt, so they became programmes about how wondrous our world was, and still could be, if we could only stop damaging it. Now, wildlife series are evolving again, and Life on Our Planet is part of a new breed that looks at humanity killing itself, and says: hey, nature has been through worse than this before. Here, the story that will happily carry on without us is told to us as an awesome, cinematic epic.</p><p>The concept is very close to that of Chris Packham’s superior BBC series Earth.
