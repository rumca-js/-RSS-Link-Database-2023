<p>A police inquiry called the Seoul crush that killed 159 a ‘man-made disaster’, yet one year on, victims’ families have no official apology, no independent inquiry and no accountability</p><p>Time stands still in Choi Min-seok’s room.

In a small pouch are his ashes, transformed into jade-coloured stones.</p><p>At 19, he had dreams of becoming a nurse, once he had completed his compulsory military service. His medical school vest still hangs on the wall.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/26/seoul-itaewon-crowd-crush-south-korea-anniversary-parents-seek-justice-one-year">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The actions taken by Spears in response to the madness around her were, in the circumstances, only proof of her sanity</p><p>The rollout this week of Britney Spears’s memoir, The Woman in Me, seeks, among all the usual aspirations of the celebrity memoir, to execute a strange brief: to prove, finally and decisively, just how competent the 41-year-old is. Spears, who for 13 years toiled under the Grimms’ Fairy Tale-like curse of a conservatorship overseen by her father, has been legally in control of her life for 18 months. With the exaggerated care of someone trying to prove they’re not drunk, her appearances this week have seemed, at times, contrived to illustrate “independence”, “fun”, and an occasionally grim-looking levity in the service of convincing everyone she’s free and in charge.</p><p>The irony is that from the outside, the trajectory of the singer’s life and career looks like a classic catch-22 in which the central trauma is so profound that no single position in regar

<p>In his explosive new documentary Mutiny in Heaven, director Ian White explores the contradictions at the heart of the menacing Melbourne band destined for self-destruction</p><p>In 1981, at a garbage dump on the outskirts of Melbourne, a band is making a video. The idea is to recreate a vision of hell. A cartoon death’s head with six limbs flashes on the screen. We see a young and scrawny Nick Cave – “a fat little insect” – pole-dancing in the middle of a circus tent. The song is an ode to self-loathing called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WO7_Zn_iKU">Nick the Stripper</a>.</p><p>Behind him, the Birthday Party swings and stumbles. After a year in London, the band – originally dubbed the Boys Next Door – have returned to their home town as a very different and much more menacing beast to cut their first full album, Prayers on Fire. The tune, if you can call it that, hangs on a ghostly three-note refrain by the guitarist Rowland S Howard.</p> <a href="https://www.theguar

<p>The underwhelming box office of the seventh instalment has now been followed by a year-long delay for the next chapter</p><p>Since 1996, the Mission: Impossible franchise has put Tom Cruise through the wringer.

<p>Three intrepid film-makers set out to investigate spooky goings-on at a remote property. If you suspect this plot was worn out, you’d be wrong</p><p>It’s to Hell House franchise creator Stephen Cognetti’s credit that this fourth film in the series manages to lovingly revivify two horror tropes usually to be found mouldering at the back of the genre closet: the found-footage expedition and demonic clowns. That is partly on account of the mythology he has accrued over the last three instalments, centring on occult goings-on at the Abaddon Hotel on New York’s rural outskirts; it is embroidered and deepened by this quasi-prequel, helping fit out those cliches with an unsettlingly long shadow.</p><p>Everything in the film is framed by a group of documentary-style talking heads, discussing the tragic attempt of their friend Margot (Bridget Rose Perrotta) to make a true-crime exposé of the Carmichael Manor. This is the site of what, in 1989, appears to have been a double, perhaps triple

<p>Bad things happen on the Yorkshire moors when an artist begins work on a haunted mansion</p><p>In the late 19th century, American weapons heiress Sarah Winchester began what would become an infamous building project: the Winchester House in San Jose. Construction lasted for decades, and the house sprawled, mazey and deliberately bizarre, with stairways leading to nowhere and one tower torn down and rebuilt more than a dozen times.</p><p>Palace of Shadows fictionalises that story and transplants it to the Yorkshire moors. Ray Celestin’s gun magnate is Mrs Chesterfield, who expands her labyrinthine mansion further and further out into the moor, perhaps to repel the spirits of those killed by her company’s bullets – or to lure them in. The real house in San Jose is strange enough, but the Chesterfield house is an even more unsettling structure, like something Lovecraft might have designed in collaboration with Piranesi.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/oct/25/palac

<p>A much-loved actor pays tribute to the Bard in this companionable but compelling memoir</p><p>Of the numerous showbiz myths that have attached themselves to Judi Dench, the most improbable is surely the account of when, as a young actor, she played the title role in Franco Zeffirelli’s production of Romeo and Juliet at the Old Vic. Legend has it when her parents came to see the play, her line “Where is my father and mother, nurse?” prompted her proud father to call out “Here we are darling, in Row H.” One of the many delights of this new book chronicling Dench’s lifelong love affair with Shakespeare is to learn that it actually occurred. “No one ever believes me when I tell that story, but I swear to God it’s true,” she says.</p><p>Dame Judi may have conquered the peaks of stage, screen and TV, but the bard has always been the bedrock of her acting passion, and during her seven-decade career she’s played nearly all the great and not so great female roles.
