That means there are all new--and quite numerous--side missions to complete, like completing all of <strong>Marko's Memories</strong>, a chain of side quests that will see the Spider-Men aiding a troubling but also troubled Sandman as his psyche has been spread across the city, crystalized as physical memories you can explore.

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvels-spider-man-2/">Spider-Man 2</a> is full of side quests, but none of them are harder to find and finish than the <strong>Spider-Bots</strong>. That's because they're scattered throughout the city and don't appear on your mini-map unless you unlock the All Seeing upgrade or successfully spot their pulse. They're so small and so numerous that they can stump you well after the credits if you're not looking intently. Alternatively, you could use our guide here and find them all easily.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Spider-Man 2 - all 42 Spider-Bots</h2><p dir="ltr">Each Spider-Bot is decorated like a different version of Spider-Man.

The director responded by saying he'd want "to play with the characters I loved.

<p>As part of Call of Duty's The Haunting event, Activision brought back the "Massive Resurgence" battle royale mode in Warzone. It increases the player count from 100 to 150, but developer Infinity Ward quickly scaled it back to 100 players. The studio has now explained why.</p><p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/InfinityWard/status/1715045251671601275?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">post on X/Twitter</a>, Infinity Ward said Massive Resurgence with 150 players felt "a bit too chaotic" for players. The Haunting added a number of spooky elements to battle royale, and 150 players instead of 100 did not provide enough "breathing room" for players to "experience all The Haunting has to offer," Infinity Ward said.</p><p>The reduced player count will remain in place for the entirety of The Haunting, which runs through November 6. After that, when things are back to normal, Infinity Ward will boost the player count back up to 150.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-cod-warzones-massive-r

You can tilt your gun to fire as you sprint or slide, allowing you to keep mobility in a gunfight without sacrificing precision like you'd lose when spraying your gun with hip-fire. This is meant to be a faster alternative to aiming down sights.</p><p dir="ltr">However, this angled position might look a bit awkward or distracting to use.

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvels-spider-man-2/">Spider-Man 2</a> offers a bigger and more detailed world than Insomniac's previous web-slinging games, so that means a longer campaign, a deeper open world, and more side missions are all to be expected. For big fans, that's probably exactly what they'd hoped anyway. If you want to check out the Spider-Man 2 mission list or learn of playtime estimates for various playstyles, here's everything you need to know.</p><h2>How long to beat Spider-Man 2</h2><p>Spider-Man 2 is about as long as other major PlayStation first-party games lately--so much so that I now wonder if it's an explicit goal within the publisher to achieve these numbers. A <strong>main-campaign-only playthrough</strong> will take you about 15 hours, while <strong>a more typical playthrough</strong>, which includes beating the full game plus a number, but not all, of side missions, is going to take you around 20 hours.

<p dir="ltr">Like Insomniac's two Spider-Man games before it, Marvel's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvels-spider-man-2/">Spider-Man 2</a> has a pretty easy Platinum Trophy to earn. There aren't really any especially unforgiving Trophies standing in your way, save for a notable exception that may have you scratching your head as you fruitlessly scour the entirety of New York City. To earn the Just Let Go Trophy, you'll need to <strong>find the science trophy Miles and Phin won together</strong> which you may recall from a flashback you witnessed during the events of Spider-Man: Miles Morales.</p><p dir="ltr">That's going to be tricky as it's quite small, meaning it's pretty well hidden despite sitting in plain sight.

<p>In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvels-spider-man-2/">Spider-Man 2</a>, the Platinum Trophy is going to be very popular with players, just as the last two were in this series. That's because it comes relatively easily, though a few Trophies may stump you. One in particular is the <strong>Home Run Trophy</strong>, which asks you to round the bases at the Big Apple Ballers Stadium. That's a simple enough task once you know where that is, so let us tell you.</p><h2>Where is Big Apple Ballers Stadium in Spider-Man 2?</h2><p>There are a few sports fields around the open world in Spider-Man 2, but if you're looking for the baseball field, you'll want to head to Coney Island, which is found in the <strong>southeastern corner of the map</strong>. The story will bring you to this area naturally, but you might overlook the field as you play carnival games and get dizzy on thrill rides, or you might want to unlock this Trophy sooner than that.

<p>In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvels-spider-man-2/">Spider-Man 2</a>, you'll need to visit Aunt May's grave if you want to unlock the game's Platinum Trophy. That seems a bit coldly juxtaposed, but to be fair, Batman Arkham did something very similar. Games have been tying somber memorials to metagame unlocks for years. If you're seeking to unlock the You Know What To Do Trophy on PS5, here's where you ought to look.</p><h2>Spider-Man 2: Where is Aunt May's grave?</h2><p>You can find Aunt May's grave in the cemetery located in the northwest corner of the map, located in the Harlem district as marked in the map below. Specifically, May's grave is nearly perfectly centered in the cemetery grounds. While playing as Peter, you can head there and look for an interaction prompt, which will pop up when you get close to it. Peter will share some words for his dearly departed and you'll earn the You Know What To Do trophy for your efforts. You can visit it as Miles too, there

Sonic as a franchise is notoriously inconsistent, offering up some amazing highs, some truly dire lows, and a fair few games that are forgettably mediocre. But then there's that one weird category several Sonics fall into: games that are obviously, undeniably flawed in some way, but still have that something that makes a Sonic game feel special. Maybe not everyone can feel what makes them great, but for others, those qual
