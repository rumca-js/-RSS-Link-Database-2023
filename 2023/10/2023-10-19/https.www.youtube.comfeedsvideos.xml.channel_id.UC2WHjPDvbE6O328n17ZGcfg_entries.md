I figure it's best to start the project using an existing boilerplate template that contains a few things that I need, like authentication, a database, nextjs, tailwindcss, and even a payment gateway which will come in handy down the line.

I'm building a platform for programmers and folks interested in computer science to discuss current tech & programming news, how we can utilize it as programmers, and what it means for us and the software development industry. It's under the same umbrella as the Dev Notes newsletter, which is a newsletter for programmers and folks interested in computer science - but the platform is to foster community and encourage discussion about these topics.
