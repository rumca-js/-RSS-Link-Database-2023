(Hacking Physics To Save Lives)", "description": "Crashing a car is usually not a good idea. But sometimes, it can save lives.\n\u2193\u2193\u2193 More info and sources below \u2193\u2193\u2193\n\nNo one ever wants to get in a car crash. But if you ever do, be very thankful for the engineers who crash test cars. You may have seen crash test simulations on TikTok using physics engines like BeamNG but I promise you they are nothing compared to the real thing! Join us for this DEEP dive into the physics of car crashes and the ways that engineers hack Newton's laws to keep you safe.\n\nFilmed on location at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety https://www.iihs.org/\nIIHS on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@iihs-hldi \nIIHS resources for teachers: https://classroom.iihs.org/ \n\nCrash test sensor car by PocketLab: https://www.thepocketlab.com/ \n\nReferences: https://sites.google.com/view/be-smart-crash-test-physics/home \n\nJoin our Patreon community: https://www.patreon.com/itsokaytobesmart\n\nSUBSCRIBE so you don\u2019t miss a video! \u25ba\u25ba http://bit.ly/iotbs_sub \n\n0:00 Intro - D", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnAhWHv9TM8", "date_published": "2023-10-19T13:13:38+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "Be Smart", "album": "Be Smart", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/SnAhWHv9TM8/hqdefault.jpg"}]
