That unparalleled level of freedom can be found in nearly every aspect of the game, from its character creation to combat, and after two full playthroughs and a dozen ongoing campaigns, I've still barely scratched the surface. No two experiences are alike, and every character I've created feels unique. While the game can't always keep up with the spontaneity of a real-life Dungeon Master, it manages to offer plenty of agency while also ensuring that its vast, web-like narrative is compelling from start to finish.\n\n#gaming #baldursgate3 #gamespot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOG1jjvLh28", "date_published": "2023-10-19T22:30:09+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GameSpot - YouTube", "album": "GameSpot - YouTube", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/pOG1jjvLh28/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Marvel's Spider-Man 2 - 9 Things I Wish I Knew", "description": "It's time to save the city again from all manor of criminals, cultists, and super villains.

But then there's that one weird category several Sonics fall into: games that are obviously, undeniably flawed in some way, but still have that something that makes a Sonic game feel special. Maybe not everyone can feel what makes them great, but for others, those qualities will overshine all of the negatives. Sonic Superstars is one such game, one with glaring flaws that I happen to like a lot.\n\n#gaming #SonicSuperstars #gamespot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENbNyvYP658", "date_published": "2023-10-19T00:23:48+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GameSpot - YouTube", "album": "GameSpot - YouTube", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/ENbNyvYP658/hqdefault.jpg"}]
