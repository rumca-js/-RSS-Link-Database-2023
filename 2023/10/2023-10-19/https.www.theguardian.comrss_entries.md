<p>The head coach was on the underdogs’ staff when they caused the biggest World Cup shock in beating South Africa in 2015</p><p>Maybe everyone is obsessing about the wrong Rugby World Cup. Of course it is tempting to fixate on the 2019 final when South Africa’s “Bomb Squad” detonated England’s hopes and dreams but in certain respects it was a spectacular one-off. Those English supporters seeking a more relevant historical precedent might just be better off casting their minds back to a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/sep/19/south-africa-japan-rugby-world-cup-2015-match-report">sunny day in Brighton in 2015</a>.</p><p>No one, as now, thought South Africa could possibly lose on that Saturday afternoon in September. They did not take into account Japan’s bright young forwards coach, one Steve Borthwick, who had been plotting the Springboks’ downfall for months. From the opening minute South Africa’s fans could scarcely believe their eyes. Rarely, if ever, has a supposed

<p>Joe Biden and Rishi Sunak are arguing for restraint in Gaza, but they show too little urgency </p><p>Joe Biden was scarcely back in the White House after Wednesday’s Middle East trip before Rishi Sunak became the next international leader to fly into Tel Aviv to express solidarity with Israel. Mr Sunak’s visit, which also came after one by the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, on Tuesday, followed an established <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/2023-10-18/rishi-sunak-to-visit-middle-east-as-concerns-grow-over-israel-gaza-crisis" title="">pattern</a>.

<p>A new drama charts the endurance athlete’s attempts to swim from Havana to Florida, accompanied by former girlfriend Bonnie Stoll and assorted marine predators. It’s a story of friendship, survival – and sharp elbows</p><p>In 1978, Diana Nyad, then 29, decided to swim from Havana to Key West, Florida. Like everything else this endurance athlete does, she made the challenge seem like no biggie: a natural progression, even, for someone whose surname is derived from the word “naiad” (water nymph) and who has been accused of having a “superiority complex”. At about 110 miles, the journey would dwarf her previous accomplishments, such as circling the island of Manhattan in just under eight hours. But it wasn’t to be. Violent storms put paid to her attempt after she had covered nearly 80 miles in 42 hours and been blown far off course.</p><p>Nevertheless, the Havana-to-Florida dream endured. As her 60th birthday loomed, and with three decades behind her as a sports broadcaster, Nyad set

Jazz musician and composer whose prolific output was deliriously entertaining, bewildering and bewitching<p>The jazz composer Carla Bley, who has died aged 87, created an enormous body of work with emotional punch, intellectual reach and musical depth. She was also a role model for independent musicians, with her own label and studio in New York state.</p><p>She wrote short, unforgettable tunes with the same authority that she applied to long, through-composed suites. Three works established her importance. A Genuine Tong Funeral (1968) was a “dark opera without words”, adapted for the vibraphone player Gary Burton. Charlie Haden’s Liberation Music Orchestra album(1969), for which Bley arranged tunes such as We Shall Overcome and Ornette Coleman’s War Orphans, showed that she could lead an unruly crew of soloists and bond them together without losing anyone’s individuality. The third career-launcher was the ambitious “chronotransduction” Escalator Over the Hill (1971), the jazz-rock-

From the much-loved gangster series Peaky Blinders to the Emmy-winning care home drama Help, Graham also has near-impeccable taste in projects. His selection process is guided by his wife (and frequent co-star), Hannah Walters, who helps Graham, who has dyslexia, sift through scripts.

<p>The super-producer, who worked with David Bowie and Marc Bolan among others, reflects on a career filled with highs and lows</p><p>In the storied London rock scene of 1969, Tony Visconti was living a dream, even if he didn’t know the full extent of it at the time. “I used to have these soirees at my apartment in Earl’s Court and, on any given night, I would have Marc Bolan and David Bowie there, and the three of us would be jamming,” he said. “I never thought to record any of that because I had no idea they were going to become legends.”</p><p>As it turned out, the music that Visconti went on to produce for both Bolan and Bowie is part of what turned them into legends. He oversaw the 10 best studio albums Bolan made with T-Rex, as well as many sets with Bowie, including such albums as The Man Who Sold the World, Young Americans, the famed Berlin trilogy, involving Low, Heroes and Lodger, as well as his final, revelatory creation, Black Star.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.co

<p>Any prospect of Polexit is now off the cards – the election results put us (unlike the poor Brits) back inside the EU tent</p><p>Ten days ago, my friends and I watched the performance of a strange play on Polish public television. Billed as a pre-election debate (indeed, the only pre-election TV debate), it featured people dressed up like journalists, acting the parts of journalists who asked the candidates such Orwellian questions as – I am paraphrasing – “Do you want Poland to be rich and secure, like it is now, or would you rather that it was poor?”</p><p>It was at this moment that we realised just how far Poland had strayed from even a semblance of democratic standards. Eight years ago, when PiS – the Law and Justice party – came to power for the first of two terms in government, nobody would have thought of hijacking public television for the propaganda aims of one party. This time, nobody was remotely surprised. The national broadcaster TVP was fully captured by PiS.</p><p>W

These were the work of Humphrey Pakington, the recusant owner who built them 400 years earlier, and much appreciated by a number of terrified Catholics back then, as well as armies of thrilled and bewildered schoolchildren ever since. These days, the manor’s website asks: “If these walls could talk … what tales of PERSECUTION and DEATH would they tell …” This makes me wonder if the backstory of the place is entirely suitable for infant minds, but I don’t recall my teachers getting very deep into the dark side of the English Reformation.</p><p>We were captivated, no doubt, but as with all school trips the des

## Christine review – Stephen King’s evil car still has a one-track mind

<p>John Carpenter’s enjoyably pulpy adaptation of King’s 1983 horror novel, about a car that infects its owners with evil, gets a 40th-anniversary revival</p><p>Three years after Stanley Kubrick unveiled the vast mysterious grandeur of his film version of The Shining, John Carpenter demonstrated a very different and more unassuming approach to Stephen King with this adaptation of King’s cult horror classic; it came out in 1983 and is now revived for its 40th anniversary. Carpenter’s attitude was very far from Kubrick’s transformative auteurist vision, closer to Brian De Palma and Carrie in fact. It did not behave as if King’s book was raw material to be refined and elevated into art; Carpenter’s Christine kept the trashiness, pulpiness and pure un-grownup-ness, like a mixture of Duel, Crash and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.</p><p>It’s the story of a red-and-white 1958 Plymouth Fury automobile called Christine with a mind of its own, discovered as a mouldering wreck by a teen car enthusias

<p>A bracing dive into the film-maker’s darkly beguiling mind</p><p>Werner Herzog plays a certain role in the public imagination. At least I think it’s the public imagination and not just my own. The German film-maker has become meme-ified and satirised – not his work, but his person, his wild-haired, Bavarian-accented, sad-eyed, difficult-truth-intoning person. As I read Herzog’s new book, I found myself thinking of the bears at my local zoo. Two young grizzlies were introduced last year; I became fascinated by them and went to see them almost every week. As I watched the bears play and swim and sleep, I was occasionally visited by strange, glinting moments of dark understanding: that they were predators, that if I met them in the wild, they might very well consign me to the void.</p><p>Of course, bears are Herzogian (if I may turn man into adjective) – after all, he made the documentary <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2006/feb/03/1" title="">Grizzly Man</a><em>, </em>a

There is outright joy in that inspired, forthright title. Surely I’m not the only Powell/Pressburger superfan to have screamed halfway through this statement from Emeric Pressburger about his writing practice, in Kevin Macdonald’s biography: “But if I can help it, I never sit down to write the real script until I know where I’m going and I’ve worked out the rhythm and so on beforehand.” Was that deliberate? I can’t tell.</p><p>I Know Where I’m Going! is a movie of romance and myth, comedy and whimsy, but fiercely rooted in reality – and geography. And it is very unusual, maybe entirely unique, in

Now they are working to restore this ancient landscape – and provide a sanctuary for guests to recharge</p><p>When Roger Tempest inherited Broughton Estate at the age of seven, tadpoles flowed from the taps and the main house was so exposed to the elements that in winter the billiard table gathered a light dusting of snow. The family dined in hats and gloves. The land had been given to his ancestors in 1097, in the aftermath of the Norman invasion, when wolves still roamed England. For almost a millennium, these 3,000 acres on the edge of the Yorkshire Dales have mirrored the history of our land: the enclosures, the persecution of predators, deforestation, modern agriculture and the gradual eradication of the wild. Today, Broughton is part of a new conversation about land use that could rewrite the book on what England looks like.</p><p>Roger is the 32nd generation, and that weight of history came with a c

<p>Ambitious, tense, explosive: this genre-blurring whodunnit travels time to visit four detectives investigating the same murder – in different eras. It’s exceptionally good value</p><p>The first episode of Bodies left me with the impression that it was yet another solid cop show, with a twist. Granted, the twist is so substantial that it should be referred to as a Twist – four detectives discover the same body, in the same spot, decades apart – but for a brief time, it seems good rather than great. Fine, not fantastic. It begins in 2023, with police attending a far-right march in London’s East End, but hops back to 1941, and 1890, before pulling off an even more audacious leap. The modern-day stuff is thrilling and tense; in the past, it is cartoonish and cod-historical. But as the first episode came to an explosive end, I immediately started the next. And the next, and the next, and the next.</p><p>It starts us off gently, in the present day. Detective sergeant Shahara Hasan (Amak

<p>As wolf numbers surge, herders in the north of the country are relearning old ways to keep the apex predators at bay</p><p>In the pre-dawn darkness of Sierra de la Culebra, Zamora, Spain, a sudden howl pierces the cold.

As the sky beings to lighten, their shapes emerge: first the alpha male, and then the rest of the wolf pack, appearing in the twilight where light and darkness merge.</p><p>In Europe, this large carnivore was hunted for centuries and almost exterminated, surviving only in inaccessible or sparsely populated areas. Now, thanks to changing attitudes and increased protection, Europe’s wolf population is slowly recovering, and the apex predators are gradually returning to their former territories.</p><p>The Iberian wolf had practically disappeared by the 1970s, but numbers have been steadily growing</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/19/wolf-how-spain-shepherds-learning-to-live-with-old-

He tells <strong>Nosheen Iqbal </strong>that if the opposition is able to form a coalition government it is likely that the new prime minister will be Donald Tusk.
