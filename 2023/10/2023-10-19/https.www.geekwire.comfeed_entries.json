The Seattle company is shutting down its core business and laying off a majority of its workforce, according to a memo sent to employees Thursday morning. The startup sent shockwaves through the Seattle tech ecosystem and broader trucking sector after abruptly shutting down operations on Wednesday. In the memo, Convoy CEO Dan Lewis said the company faced both an &#8220;unprecedented freight market collapse&#8221; and &#8220;dramatic monetary tightening.&#8221; &#8220;This combination ultimately crushed our progress at the same time that it was crushing our logical strategic acquirer \u2014 it&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2023/convoy-collapse-read-ceos-memo-detailing-sudden-shutdown-of-seattle-trucking-startup/\">Read More<", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2023/convoy-collapse-read-ceos-memo-detailing-sudden-shutdown-of-seattle-trucking-startup/", "date_published": "2023-10-19T16:09:54+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GeekWire", "album": "GeekWire", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://www.geekwire.com/wp-content/themes/geekwire/dist/images/geekwire-logo-rss.png"}, {"source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed/", "title": "Seattle cloud company Skytap lands $18M", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Brad-Schick-Outdoor_Web.jpg\" width=\"500\" /><br />Skytap, a Seattle company that helps companies move operations to the cloud, raised $18 million in funding from Vistara Growth.", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2023/seattle-cloud-company-skytap-lands-18m/", "date_published": "2023-10-19T15:48:47+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GeekWire", "album": "GeekWire", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://www.geekwire.com/wp-content/themes/geekwire/dist/images/geekwire-logo-rss.png"}, {"source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed/", "title": "As the GeekWire Summit kicks off, see what geeks on the street have to say about AI", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"709\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/geek-on-the-street-1260x709.jpg\" width=\"1260\" /><br />At the GeekWire Summit in Seattle today, we&#8217;re going to hear from a variety of speakers and panelists about how artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming society. The title of our annual tech conference is &#8220;AI Gets Real.&#8221; During a recent visit to the historic Pike Place Place Market, I gave tourists and other geeks on the street the chance to get real, and share their impressions of AI.

When one of the boys was 2, he set him up with an app to watch vaguely educational programming during a long flight.
