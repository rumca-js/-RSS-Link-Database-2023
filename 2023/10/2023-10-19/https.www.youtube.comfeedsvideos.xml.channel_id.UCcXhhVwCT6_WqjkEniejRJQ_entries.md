Huge Thanks to Tom and Yan for the www.tightinator.fun tool!
This tool has really been such a help in my process to find a way to accurately rotate a shaft using mechanics only.

The Tightinator  is measuring the tightness of transients by measuring the standard deviation of a set number of consecutive transients. When we are looking at the "Best 300" its the tightest 300 consecutive transients of an audio recording we are measuring.
