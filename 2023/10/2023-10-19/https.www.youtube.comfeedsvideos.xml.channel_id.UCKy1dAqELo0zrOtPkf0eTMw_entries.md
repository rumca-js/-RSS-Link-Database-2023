In today's Daily Fix:
A reliable leaker may have revealed the U.S. date for the PlayStation 5 slim and PS5 slim bundle with Spider-Man 2. It doesn't look like there's a fancy Spider-themed PS5 in the bundle, just the standard edition with a copy of the game. That bundle looks like it'll arrive in stores on November 8 for $559.99. The non-bundle PS5 slims will go on sale November 10. In other news, the Metal Gear Solid Master Collection, Volume 1 will finally let you pause during those lengthy cutscenes—the catch is that it might take about 10 seconds to actually see the pause menu. A YouTuber had apparently gotten ahold of an early copy and in his streamed gameplay, it took quite a while to actually pause the game. This could be a bug that'll be patched out likely on Day 1, or...maybe it's Konami's way of making you sit through those cutscenes? And finally, The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria has been delayed on PS5 just days ahead of its launch. The PC version will hit the Epic G

This isn't a graphics comparison, just some gameplay to show how the city has changed, but we recorded in 4K Fidelity mode in both games. Spider-Man 2 features Venom, Kraven, and a whole host of new and returning villains alongside new abilities, skills, suits, and more.

Wizard with a Gun reviewed by Carli Velocci on PC, also available on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5.

Wizard with a Gun does what it says on the tin, but not much more. There are tons of cool guns and spells to craft, elemental enemies to defeat, and neat areas to explore. But poor balance in almost every aspect of combat and an unsatisfying ending make a lot of the time spent not seem worthwhile. With some updates and improvements where it counts, Wizard with a Gun could be a fun time for survival sandbox fans, but right now it feels unfinished.

Cities: Skylines 2 reviewed by Leana Hafer on PC.
Cities: Skylines 2 is not the best game in the lineage of Will Wright's original 1989 classic. The champion is still the original Cities: Skylines, at least for now. If Skylines 2 gets the same incredible post-launch support and additional paid and free content as its predecessor, and if the modding community is allowed to thrive, I think this sequel might come out ahead in the long run. There are so many enjoyable new systems and exciting additions, sadly encased in an awful-looking block of concrete that gets in the way of how much I know I could be loving them. It makes too many promises of realism that its most basic features like zoning can't deliver on. It feels like playing a beta, or a very early Early Access game. Frankly, Skylines 2 could have used another few months in the city planning office. For now, it's more of a fixer-upper.
