It's under the same umbrella as the Dev Notes newsletter, which is a newsletter for programmers and folks interested in computer science - but the platform is to foster community and encourage discussion about these topics.\n\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0f Dev Notes Newsletter: https://www.devnotesdaily.com/\n\ud83c\udfa5 Dev Notes on YouTube: @devnotesdaily \n\ud83d\udcd3  Studious, Notion Template for Students: https://notionstudent.com\n\n\ud83d\udc31\u200d\ud83d\ude80 GitHub: https://github.com/forrestknight\n\ud83d\udc26 Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/forrestpknight\n\ud83d\udcbc LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/forr", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8tZuv3JIJY", "date_published": "2023-10-19T18:00:10+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "ForrestKnight", "album": "ForrestKnight", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/T8tZuv3JIJY/hqdefault.jpg"}]
