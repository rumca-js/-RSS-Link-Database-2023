<p>Bill Sweeney’s comments show an unwillingness to give teams like the one they face on Saturday a hand on or off the field</p><p>Buried somewhere between Bill Sweeney’s insistence this week that he is still the right man to lead the Rugby Football Union, the outlandish assertion that “we are on the cusp of something quite spectacular”, the 38-minute monologue of excuses including those for four professional clubs going to the wall, there was one claim that particularly grated. Here was Sweeney effectively complaining about the suggestion that when teams such as Samoa – England’s World Cup opponents on Saturday in Lille – play at Twickenham, they might be given a bigger match fee for their troubles. Woe is Bill.</p><p>Sweeney would do well to remember that the last time Samoa were due to play at Twickenham, against the Barbarians in 2021, the match was cancelled at barely 90 minutes’ notice because of a Covid outbreak among the players and support staff of the invitational side.

<p>A standout turn from the Oscar winner anchors an entertaining throwback to 90s legal dramas based on an unlikely true story</p><p>Based in the mid-90s, Amazon’s robust legal drama The Burial also moves like a movie made during that exact time, in the very best way possible. The period was jam-packed with grand, dad-pleasing films taking place in the courtroom, predominantly based on books by John Grisham, perfectly tailored to big stars seeking a way to show off their argumentative skills, an actors’ showcase that at the time couldn’t be topped.</p><p>Here it’s the turn of Jamie Foxx, the sort of big, charismatic movie star it’s become too easy to underestimate as it’s become so rare for us to see him operating at his very best.

<p>A new show focuses on 50 years of groundbreaking portraiture, from babies in messy bathrooms to a grandmother explaining race to her granddaughter</p><p>JJ Levine’s Alone Time 19, taken in 2021, appears to be a conventional portrait of a traditional nuclear family: mother, father, two children, all gathered in a living room. We know the little girl is a little girl because she’s in a floral dress and has a pink bow plonked on her head. The little boy wears blue jeans and a backwards baseball cap. Look closer, though, and you begin to see a resemblance between not just the kids but also their parents who (despite different hairstyles, clothes and poses) share the same features and build. In the series Alone Time, Montréal-based artist Levine creates images of couples – and in this case a couple and their kids – with one model playing both sides of the couple, upending the idea that gender is fixed.</p><p>“There’s a tension in all my work between reality and fiction,” says Levine, w

<p>The City of Music has become unaffordable for musicians – and a magnet for partiers. Streaming services have only made things harder</p><p>In June 2016, Tiffany Gassette looked for a place to park her RV. She ended up in Lyles, Tennessee, an hour from Nashville. For the next six months, she and her three-year-old daughter, Calliope – named after the Greek muse of epic poetry and heroic song – lived off a dirt road in the middle of nowhere. For 20 miles, there was nothing but a Walmart.</p><p>Tiffany had never lived in an RV before. When winter came, the temperature dropped. The regulator on her propane tank froze. The space heaters blew out her breakers. One day, after she dropped Calliope off at daycare, she went into Nashville to busk. When she got home, her dog couldn’t see her. The cold weather had triggered her acute glaucoma. It was the loneliest, saddest time of her life. “What right do I have to be here with this child?” she asked herself. “This is no life.”</p> <a href="h

<p>As you prepare bulbs for winter, stacking them in a large container can yield spectacular results – once you get the hang of it</p><p>The brown boxes have been stacking up by the back door since the beginning of September, but I am finally thinking about planting the bulbs inside. I tend to plant them late; I’ve happily tripped over those boxes until January in the past – the flowers still come – because we live in London, where it is often warm until the year wanes, and there is always something else to do.</p><p>However, if you’re feeling keen, you can start to plant them now. A savvy bulb order will include ones that flower as early as February and March (earlier daffs, crocus, <em>Iris reticulata</em>) all the way through to late May (alliums and <em>nectaroscordum</em>). These can be planted in the same bed to usher a wave of flowers all the way through from the dregs of winter to the first barbecues of summer. In container gardens, this is where something called the bulb las
