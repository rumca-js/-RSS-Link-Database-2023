Dedicated space missions acquire these signal reflections to amass valuable environmental information. The shoebox-sized PRETTY CubeSat, flying on Europe's next Vega launcher, will investigate a new frequency and novel observation angle to better measure the rate of climate change—at the same time as gathering radiation data on its surrounding space environment.

## Unearthing the leaf miners of ancient times: 312-million-year-old fossil sheds light on insect behavior and evolution

Insects are fragile, soft-bodied animals whose remains are difficult to preserve. Wings are often fossilized, but insect bodies, if present, are usually bits and pieces of the original prehistoric animal, making it difficult for scientists to study them. One way paleontologists learn about prehistoric insects is by trace fossils, which are almost exclusively found as traces on fossil plants.

A team of astrophysicists, led by researchers from the universities of Amsterdam and Princeton, has now shown that if dark matter consists of axions, it may reveal itself in the form of a subtle additional glow coming from pulsating stars. Their work is published in the journal Physical Review Letters.
