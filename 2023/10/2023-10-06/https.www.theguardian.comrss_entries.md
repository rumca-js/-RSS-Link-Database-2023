<p>Steve Coogan’s take on the serial sex offender is astonishingly spooky. But questions remain as to whether it should have been made – and whether the BBC has given itself too easy a ride</p><p>There were no cameraphones when Margaret Thatcher spent Christmas Day at Chequers with Jimmy Savile in the 1980s. But the BBC’s controversial and much anticipated Savile drama The Reckoning serves as a sort of historical Instagram, bringing vivid and intimate pictures from the kitchen and halls of the prime ministerial retreat.</p><p>With Steve Coogan’s cunningly unctuous Savile and Fenella Woolgar’s icily strategic Thatcher matching each other for full body-capture acting, these superb scenes in the third of the four hour-long episodes illustrate how the prime minister so fell for Savile that she placed a serial sex offender <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/12/jimmy-savile-broadmoor-volunteer-role">in charge of Broadmoor psychiatric hospital.</a></p><p>The Reckoning will

<p>With the champions short of midfield options, Sunday’s game is an opportunity for Mikel Arteta’s side to turn the tables</p><p>It was not without a few strokes of luck that Arsenal edged past Manchester City in December 2015, clinging on at the end for a 2-1 win to send their supporters home dreaming of the title over Christmas. Mikel Arteta, deep into the injury-hit winter of his playing career, watched his teammates contentedly enough from the side and a breeze of change swirled around the visiting camp. The previous day Pep Guardiola had confirmed his departure from Bayern Munich and the process to install him at the Etihad Stadium was, in reality, well down the track.</p><p>Given Arsenal have not beaten City in their 15 top-flight meetings since, taking a sole early point from their encounters with Guardiola, the symbolism is clear. Ending their two-decade wait for the domestic crown will surely require putting a stop to that run and leaping the one hurdle that, during their r

<ul><li>Pool A: France 60-7 Italy</li><li>Hosts book quarter-final place as pool winners</li></ul><p>Et voilà. France are through to the quarter-finals of their own Rugby World Cup after the tournament’s latest mismatch against a demoralised Italy. The unthinkable outcome – a pool-stage exit for Fabien Galthié’s side – had remained a possibility before the game, but was never on the cards from the moment Damian Penaud scored the first of eight French tries in the second minute. Not even before that, in truth, considering France have now beaten Italy 14 times consecutively, a run stretching back to 2014.</p><p>If the predatory Penaud’s progress is a marker of France’s hopes, their fellow title contenders should be worried. The wing has now scored in seven straight matches and 14 times this year. Two tries here took him to second overall in their men’s try-scorers’ chart, with 35, now only three behind Serge Blanco. As a whole, the French machine is tuning up satisfactorily with top sp

<p>Ghosts is one of TV’s best comedies, and this funny and clever final season doesn’t disappoint. It is touching and comforting without being cheesy. Let’s hope they haunt us again one day…</p><p>Ghosts has been one of the warmest and most consistent comedies of the last few years.

Still, all good hauntings must come to an end, and this fifth series is the last.</p><p>In many ways, its end point is arbitrary. The formula is so good, and so well-oiled, that you get the sense it could have gone on for ever.

It is about abuse, violence, recovery and the redemptive power of sexual intimacy, but also about just what its title proclaims: memory, and how this accumulates over a lifetime to form an identity. Yet memory is unreliable building material; memory is the uncertain support underneath us, but solid as a crushing burden above us, a destructive gravitational force that could annihilate us entirely. And apart from anything else, memory is not necessarily the truth, so attempts to deny it are not necessarily dishonest or delusional.<br /><br />This movi

## Comedian Lou Sanders: ‘It blows my mind that people still don’t want to believe women’

<p>Off the heels of publishing a memoir, the star of Taskmaster and Mel Giedroyc: Unforgivable discusses unhappy readers, deleting Twitter, and outing Russell Brand</p><p>“Can you say I wafted in looking stunning?” asks Lou Sanders, dissolving into laughter before she’s even finished her sentence. She is joking, of course – the comedian isn’t actually desperate for a hyperbolically awed 2000s glossy magazine-style depiction of herself in print. It’s just that airing the silliest, cringiest, most wildly conceited response to any given situation – always coupled with a self-effacing acknowledgment of the ridiculousness of what she’s saying – is Sanders’ stock in trade.</p><p>What really happens is that Sanders strides into the Groucho Club (admittedly, quite a 2000s glossy mag setting) dressed, I will say, in a very fetching lilac jumpsuit. She is late but doesn’t waste time with small talk. Before she’s even properly sat down, she launches into her list of worries: she is anxious she’

<p>Aldi has had a dip in form of late, but still has a couple of decent French and Chilean lines, but Marks &amp; Spencer has some very good buys at keen prices</p><p>“What’s the best supermarket for wine?” That’s a question I am often asked, and there is no definitive answer. It depends on what you’re looking for: bargain buys or interesting bottles?</p><p>What I don’t always point out, but should, is that the answer can and does change. Supermarkets have good and bad phases, depending not only on the buying team, but also on the constraints under which they’re operating. Will their customers tolerate higher <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/aug/25/how-to-beat-the-wine-price-rise-fiona-beckett">prices</a>?

<p><strong>Crucible, Sheffield <br /></strong>It takes a while to get going but when it hits its straps, thanks to the cast’s skilful handling of farce, Sarah Tipple’s production from the Roger McGough translation becomes genuinely funny<strong><br /></strong><br /></p><p>This show presents several puzzles: how can it drag for 40 minutes and then zip along for 30? How are there underpowered performances then energetically hilarious turns moments later? How does director Sarah Tipple marshal her resources around the Crucible perfectly in one moment and then seem to lose grip of the space’s unique demands the next?</p><p>This Roger McGough translation of Molière’s Le Malade Imaginaire won fans in 2009. For a good portion of the first act, you wonder why this historic piece wasn’t left in the past.

<p>Labour’s plan for VAT and business rates on these institutions is not only fair – it’s financially sensible</p><p>One of Labour’s few firm policy commitments is to start charging VAT on Britain’s free-paying schools, and full business rates on those in England as already happens in Scotland. This has generated a loud but often poorly informed debate as the Conservatives, ever-enthusiastic advocates for the independent sector, defend its tax breaks.</p><p>The UK has about 2,600 private schools (for-profit and charitable), and they are all exempt from VAT. Additionally, the 1,300 schools with charitable status pay no corporation tax, capital gains tax or stamp duty. They also benefit from capital gains and inheritance tax relief, and gift aid on donations. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/05/rishi-sunak-and-wife-donate-over-100000-to-winchester-college">Records from 2020 show</a> that Rishi Sunak and his wife, Akshata Murthy, have donated more than £100,000 to

<p>A witty and incisive skewering of the patriachy in society and science, with endearingly straight-talking characters</p><p>Elizabeth Zott is a research scientist trying to make her way in a man’s world. It’s 1952, a time when women are expected to give up their careers to get married and have children. But Elizabeth isn’t content having her work sidelined – or, worse still, stolen – by her male colleagues at California’s Hastings Research Institute, so she resolves to keep working and never get married. When she falls in love with Calvin Evans, a Nobel-nominated chemist, she declines his marriage proposal but agrees to move in with him and get a dog.</p><p>Bonnie Garmus’s smart and funny feminist fable – a TV adaptation of which arrives this month on Apple TV+ starring Brie Larson – is read by the British actor Miranda Raison, who delights in Elizabeth’s pithy observations on the many ways women are undermined by men.

<p>The star Icelandic pianist is having an extraordinary year – recording, and now performing, Bach’s epic work 88 times around the world. He explains why it gripped his imagination, and pushed him beyond the limit</p><p>Bach is the musical love of my life. I cannot go more than a couple of days without playing his works. For me, Bach’s music does not belong to a bygone era, it belongs to the here and now. That’s one of the reasons he fascinates every new generation of musicians – because of how inherently open this music is to new ideas, styles and emotions. His music always reflects the world it finds itself in, past, present and future.</p><p>I write this as I embark on a most extraordinary year – by any standards – but particularly by those of a classical musician. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/sep/24/vikingur-olafsson-review-icelandic-pianist-brings-magic-and-spontaneity-to-bach">I am playing one single work, the Goldberg</a> Variations, <a href="https://www.vi

<p>The matinee idol’s death in 1985 changed the public’s perception of Aids. Yet in life, the golden age actor was anything but an activist</p><p>Gore Vidal’s reaction to the news of Truman Capote’s death in 1984 is well known. “Good career move,” the writer said. Rock Hudson, once the most bankable star in Hollywood, died the following year – like Capote, he was 59 – but the manner of his death and the revelations that preceded it have deterred anyone from applying Vidal’s line to him. Looked at coldly from a 21st-century vantage point, though, Hudson’s death was a good career move, deepening his persona in ways that would never otherwise have happened. The actor died of complications from Aids, having been outed as gay months beforehand. His sexuality had been an open secret within the industry for decades: his pool parties, described as “blond bacchanalias”, were legendary. The public, however, remained oblivious until 1985. “It’s odd to put it like this,” says his biographer, Mar

<p>Class politics is nowhere more visible than in the protected slaughter of game, with disastrous effects on our countryside</p><p>It’s one of the bluntest expressions of class power in the United Kingdom. Like all expressions of class power, it has become normalised until we treat it as a fixed fact of national life. I’m talking about the bronze plague that spreads over the British lowlands every year, wiping out much of our wildlife: pheasants.</p><p>This week, the pheasant shooting season began, appropriately coinciding with the Conservative party conference. Killing them requires no physical exertion and a limited skillset, as the birds are driven over the heads of the shooters by people hired to flush them out of the woods. The men (almost all are) with the guns spray shot at the low-flying birds, killing some, wounding some, missing others. One estimate <a href="https://www.animalaid.org.uk/revealed-40-birds-shot-sport-wounded-never-recovered/">suggests that between 30% and 40

<p>Tom Hiddleston’s lovably narcissistic Norse god is back with Owen Wilson for a spectacular time-hopping caper that may just save the MCU from certain death</p><p>If ever there was a time for a second season of Loki, it’s now. The first outing was a witty romp through time and space, in which Tom Hiddleston’s lovably narcissistic Norse god charmed the pants off viewers. There were wild cameos (Richard E Grant as a weird alternate Loki!). There was sizzling chemistry (the bromance with Owen Wilson’s Agent Mobius!). There was even the tender blossoming of love (with Loki’s metaverse alter ego Sylvie – almost certainly the most poignant romance a TV character has ever conducted with themselves). So, naturally, the Marvel Cinematic Universe chose to follow up this televisual triumph with a disastrous series of flops, culminating in June’s Secret Invasion: a slog of a show that felt like the death knell for the franchise’s entire TV future.</p><p>Luckily, Loki’s action-packed return sug

<p>The felling of a Northumberland tree has made headlines around the world – and led to a criminal investigation. Why did it mean so much to people?</p><p>When the famous Sycamore Gap tree, thought to be more than 300 years old, was cut down last week it caused not just anger but deep sadness. The Guardian north of England correspondent <strong>Robyn Vinter</strong> travelled to Hadrian’s Wall to report on it and was struck by the grief people felt. Even the police on the scene had stories to tell of their personal connections to the tree, which had become one of the most photographed in Britain.</p><p><strong>Michael Safi</strong> hears how the tree was a beloved living monument. How for some people it represented the beauty of the north-east, and was prized by others for the sense of history it evoked. Robin explains what local people want to see put up in its place.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/oct/06/why-britain-is-mourning-the-sycamore-gap-tree-podca
