<p>Car dealers can give buyers an instant rebate for purchasing certain electric vehicles starting in January of 2024, according to new <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-issues-guidance-for-the-transfer-of-clean-vehicle-credits-and-updates-frequently-asked-questions">guidance released by the IRS</a>. The memo <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/taxpros/fs-2023-22.pdf">says</a> eligible vehicles may qualify for a tax credit of up to $7,500. However, the credit amount will depend on whether an EV and its buyer meet certain requirements, and when a car is actually purchased.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For an electric car to qualify, it needs to have a minimum battery capacity of seven kilowatt hours. Buyers can’t claim the credit if their adjusted gross income exceeds certain thresholds – $300,000 if married and filing jointly, and $150,000 for the majority of single taxpayers. The manufacturer’s suggested retail price for the EV also can not exceed specific price points. For sport utility vehic

<p>Atari just announced <a href="https://atari.com/products/save-mary-limited-edition"><ins>preorders for a physical cartridge</ins></a> for the company’s once-ubiquitous 2600 console. You read that right. A gaming console that counts 1982 as its most successful year is releasing another new cartridge in the year 2023. The game-in-question is called <em>Save Mary</em> and was actually developed during the console’s golden years, before being shelved when the 2600 went the way of the dodo.</p>
<p><em>Save Mary </em>was in development for two whole years, which is a lifetime in the generation of gaming that preceded the NES. The normal timeframe to produce a game back then was six to nine months, with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-05-01-true-story-et-atari.html"><ins>some notorious titles</ins></a> taking just five or six weeks. <em>Save Mary</em> was originally developed by veteran Atari staffer Tod Frye, the guy behind the 2600 version of <em>Pac-Man</em> and <a href="https:

<p>Yes, Techtober is in full swing! This week, Cherlynn and Devindra chat with Engadget’s Sam Rutherford about everything from the Made by Google event. That includes the Pixel 8, Pixel 8 Pro and Pixel Watch 2. We give Google credit for leaning on AI long before it was trendy, but we wonder if the Pixel 8 Pro’s temperature sensor will actually be useful. Also, we dive into Samsung’s latest FE devices, Apple’s fix for overheating iPhone 15s, and Google’s Chromebook Plus initiative.</p>

<p>Ancient, vine-draped monuments and towering obelisks protrude from the forest floor, connected by a maze of stone paths and one hyper-speed transit capsule. Statues loom among the monoliths: hooded human figures and mythological beasts surrounded by saintly geometry in gold and turquoise. I’m running down an overgrown platform by the water, sun radiating off the side of my face, trying to find the next puzzle. I take a sharp turn, the shadows shift and my silhouette is suddenly projected in front of me: waist on a slim pivot, hip joints jutting out, sticklike arms. I remember I’m made of metal and wires, and for a brief moment, I’m surprised. I forgot — I’m a robot.</p>

<p><em>The Talos Principle 2</em> reintroduces a post-apocalyptic world filled with the puzzles and dreams society left behind, and populates it with a race of machines who simultaneously worship humans and consider themselves to be the natural evolution of humanity.

<p>Instagram might let you share Stories only with specific groups of friends in the future. During a broadcast on his page, Instagram head Adam Mosseri has revealed that the social media app has started testing the ability to share Stories to multiple audience lists. The app already has a &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-30-instagrams-close-friends-feature-lets-you-keep-stories-privat.html">Close Friends</a>&quot; feature, which gives you the ability to add certain friends to a list and to share Stories to that group of people only. It gives you a bit of privacy on the social network, especially if you have a public profile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But sometimes, you may have things to share with people outside your closest group of friends. Having the option to create and maintain multiple lists means you don't have to add people to your Close Friends list if they don't fit the description and can share relevant updates with different groups of people and subsets of followers.
