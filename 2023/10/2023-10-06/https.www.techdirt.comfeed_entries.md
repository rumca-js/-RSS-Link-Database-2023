Texas’s effort, H.B. 1181, requires commercial pornographic websites—and others, as we’ll see shortly—to verify that their users are adults, and to display state-drafted warnings about pornography’s alleged health dangers. In late August, a federal district judge blocked the law from [&#8230;]

In August we wrote about a rumored plan of Elon Musk to remove headlines from the TwitterCards (are they now X-cards? who the hell knows?), basically making the site completely useless for news consumption. At the time Musk claimed it was somehow more aesthetically pleasing. Because that’s what everyone looks for in their news links: [&#8230;]

Former officer/current prisoner Derek Chauvin decided to personify endemic police racism by pressing his knee to the neck of an unarmed black man for nearly ten minutes. This display of power continued for three minutes after another officer told Officer Chauvin he could no longer detect a pulse. This act saw Officer Derek Chauvin join [&#8230;]

Last week, exTwitter’s CEO-in-name-only Linda Yaccarino gave what is the cringiest interviews I’ve ever seen at the Code Conference. Multiple people told me they couldn’t watch more than a few minutes of it. It’s so bad. She is barely listening, extremely dismissive of important questions, and acting as if people are lucky to hear her. [&#8230;]

During peak pandemic, the FCC launched the Emergency Broadband Benefit (EBB program), giving lower income Americans a $50 ($75 for those in tribal lands) discount off of their broadband bill.

Adidas has a reputation as a jealous defender, and at times is better described as an aggressor, when it comes to enforcing its trademark rights, specifically around its admittedly famous 3 stripes logo.
