		The rise of the gig economy brings with it unchecked instances of child labor in Brazil. It's also caused an increase in Identity theft and fraud, according to a U.S. report. Facial recognition may help, but early returns in Brazil are disappointing.
<h2>In Brazil, underaged workers circumvent face biometrics</h2>
Though major delivery apps in Brazil use face biometrics to combat child labor on their platforms, minors are circumventing the safeguard, according to <a href="https://restofworld.org/2023/underage-gig-workers-brazil/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Rest of World</a>.

One restaurant owner said when an order is assigned to a female driver, the worker who arrives is usually a minor. Minors also tend to come on weekends, when restaurants are busiest.

		A lengthy newspaper article about facial recognition in schools and a likewise robust report by the American Civil Liberties Union leave the impression that local U.S. education officials aren't leading biometrics debates.

They're more being driven to decisions by fearful parents and fear-mongering vendors.

The article is in the Helena, Mont., Independent Record. It sketches a rural, conservative and gun-stocking state that this year banned continuous use of facial recognition algorithms by state and local governments.

But a lawmaker <a href="https://helenair.com/news/state-regional/facial-recognition-tech-technology-remains-school-despite-state-ban-frt/article_81a35a96-5243-11ee-9112-4f306f94289c.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">told a reporter</a> h

		American Express announced it is adding face and fingerprint recognition to SafeKey to meet regulatory requirements and securely streamline online checkout through a pilot program, claiming to be the first card issuer to use such features. Select U.S. card members can use SafeKey to check out on devices that support facial or fingerprint recognition.

SafeKey is American Express’ security standard for online transactions, based on the <a href="https://3dsecure2.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">3D Secure</a> protocol for card-not-present transactions.

If a customer is checking out through a participating merchant, SafeKey works in the background during the checkout process to make sure the card owner is conducting the transaction.

		The Security Industry Association has weighed in on a biometric privacy lawsuit that claims Meta broke the law with a discontinued face-scanning app.

SIA members say if the proposed class action filed under Illinois' Biometric Information Privacy Act is successful, it would depart from the intentions of the legislation by making biometric access control products illegal in the state.

In Zellmer vs. Facebook (<a href="https://casetext.com/case/zellmer-v-facebook-inc-2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">18-cv-01880</a>), the plaintiff accuses Meta with capturing, scanning and possessing photos of his face in the app, Tag Suggestions.

USAID is currently working on expanding third-party monitoring and other reforms, including spot checks on vendors and biometric verification of recipients, with the aim of resuming full assistance in Ethiopia.

The U.S. will immediately restart food assistance at 28 camps inside Ethiopia that are home to a million refugees, following an agreement with the Ethiopian government to transfer responsibility for storing and distributing the food to

		Two of the United States' top security agencies are recommending seven general best practices for digital identity and access management (IAM) developers and integrators of multi-factor authentication and single sign-on features.

The National Security Agency and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security agency (known better as the NSA and CISA) created the <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2023/Oct/04/2003313510/-1/-1/0/ESF%20CTR%20IAM%20MFA%20SSO%20CHALLENGES.PDF" rel="noopener" target="_blank">short list</a> as part of a large report on major but addressable industry challenges.

		Nigeria’s beleaguered passport issuance system is witnessing a revolution lately with a huge backlog of 204,332 passports cleared in three weeks by the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS).
