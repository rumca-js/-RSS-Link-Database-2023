A reference to a "remastered" version The Last of Us Part 2 has been spotted on the profile of a Naughty Dog developer, lending further credence to suggestions an enhanced version of the game is on the way.
</p><p>
Hints that a new edition of The Last of Us Part 2 was in development at Naughty Dog first surfaced back in July, when the game's composer, Gustavo Santaolalla, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-composer-lets-slip-new-edition-is-in-the-pipeline">referenced</a> a "new edition" that would enable players to interact with his banjo-playing cameo in the town of Jackson, selecting from a number of songs he can play.
</p><p>
Santaolalla wouldn't share any more details beyond that, leaving fans to ponder what exactly he was referring to. And now, thanks to

Five months after release, Bethesda's beleaguered vampire shooter Redfall has received its long-promised 60fps mode on Xbox Series X/S, as part of a major patch that also brings improved performance on PC, stealth takedowns, increased enemy counts, and more.
</p><p>
A 60fps mode for Redfall was first touted back in April, after Bethesda broke the news its game would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/redfall-locked-to-30fps-on-xbox-series-xs-at-launch">locked to 1440p and 30fps</a> on both Xbox Series X and S at launch. The studio did, however, promise a 60fps "Performance mode" would arrive at some point after release - although it's doubtful many were expecting it to take five moths to arrive.
</p><p>
Redfall's performance mode comes as part of a <a href="https://bethesda.net/e

## Baldur's Gate 3 now lets you change your name thanks to Hotfix #9

Life may be full of regrets, but if one of those regrets is that you decided to call your Baldur's Gate 3 character Bumfart the Third in a moment of weakness, there's some good news: the game's latest hotfix will finally let you change their ill-conceived name.
</p><p>
That's the headline feature for Baldur's Gate 3's Hotfix #9 (or at least it is if you're a remorseful Bumfart), but there's more where that came from. The Magic Mirror, for instance, will - as well as enabling the aforementioned renaming unshaming - allow you to customise your hirelings if their outward appearance isn't to your liking.
</p><p>
Developer Larian notes the same restrictions apply to hirelings that apply <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-patch-3-now-live-lets-you-change-your-characters-appearance">when changing the appearance

## Hands-on with AMD FSR 3 frame generation - taking the fight to DLSS 3

Two titles had supported added: Forspoken and Immortals of Aveum. We'd already seen demos of both games under controlled conditions at Gamescom back in August, but this was our first chance to go hands-on and to truly put FSR 3 through its paces. The verdict? Image quality in terms of generated frames is impressive, but elsewhere there are some fundamental issues AMD needs to address.</p><p>Let's quickly review what frame generation is about. Nvidia kicked this all off with DLSS 3, and in many respects, FSR 3 follows the exact same principles. The next frame is rendered and the one beyond that too, then via a combination of optical flow analysis informed via inputs from the game engine - such as motion vectors, for example - an intermediate frame is

If Dave the Diver is great (which it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-a-dizzying-game-of-many-parts-and-a-journey-into-deep-wonder">officially is</a>, of course) then it stands to reason that more Dave the Diver will also be great. So prepare to be showered in additional greatness when Dave the Diver's first proper content updates arrives "real soon".
</p><p>
Dave the Diver's previous big update, which released in August, was predominantly focused on quality of life improvements, and while there're plenty more of those stuffed into October's update, we get a bunch of new content too.

The glacier area, for instance - which primarily exists as a story-focused location with fewer missions compared to its counterparts right now - will receive new quests. Additionally, the ocean is set to welcome new spe

This map, which is described as an "urban battleground" was unveiled as part of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o2bxsRvvEE">Call of Duty: Next</a>. It will arrive with the first season of Modern Warfare 3 sometime in December.

Urzikstan is in Western Asia and borders the  Republic of Adal. Call of Duty regulars will know this area as the location of Warzone's Al Mazrah map.

We finally have a release date for American Arcadia: 15th November on PC (via Steam). So, if you are anything like me and rather looking forward to this release, thankfully there is not too much longer to wait. 
</p><p>
If you are unsure of what American Arcadia is all about, I will give you a little overview. It is by Out of the Blue, the same studio that gave us <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-the-sea-review-eerie-puzzles-in-paradise">2020's rather special Call of the Sea</a>, and set in the "retro-futuristic '70 metropolis" Arcadia.

On the outside, Arcadia seems to promise its residents a life of cushy luxury, but all is not what it seems. In fact, the Arcadia residents are all part of a TV show, and they have no idea they are being recorded for the entertainment of the wider publi

Microsoft plans to finally buy Activision Blizzard for $68.7bn next Friday, 13th October, according to a fresh report from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/6/23905946/microsoft-activision-blizzard-deal-finalization-timing-cma">The Verge</a>.
</p><p>
That date is still contingent on the UK's Competition and Markets Authority giving the deal an official green light - though the regulator <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-activision-blizzard-bid-provisionally-approved-by-uk-regulator">has already signalled it is likely to do so</a>. 
</p><p>
The CMA has until 18th October to weigh in with its final decision, following a deadline today for feedback on the deal's revised form - now Microsoft has agreed to sell off streaming rights for Activision Blizzard games to Ubisoft.

## Payday 3 review - furiously good fun, if criminally unadventurous

It's not that there's anything actually wrong with Payday 3. The levels are well-designed, encouraging the kind of outside-the-box thinking that rewards both the bold and the curious. The effervescent glee you feel each time you saunter past a security camera with a sports bag stuffed full of money on your back is unrivalled, and for those opting for a less stealthy approach, the gunplay &ndash; if requiring a little acclimation at first &ndash; is punchy and impactful. 
</p><p>
The trouble with Payday 3, though, is that whilst in isolation, it's a perfectly perfunctory shooter that'll happily keep you sated for a few weekends, when compared to its own predecessor, the new game repeatedly comes up short. Yes, we have some new gadgets to try, and yes, there are new ways to manage the civvies caught up in your criminal shenanigans, but ult

Earlier this week, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14s-next-patch-growing-light-gets-a-release-date">game's latest patch (6.5)</a> was released and in its ending cutscene there's a pair of legs that appear to be from a potential new playable race.

Payday 3 has had a rather rocky start, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-players-endure-second-consecutive-day-of-server-issues-preventing-them-from-playing">server issues plaguing its launch</a> leaving many unable to play the always-online heist shooter.

This patch was initially meant to be released yesterday, 5th October, and address "200+ QoL-improvements for all platforms". However, the developer has pushed it back until an unspecified time in mid-October. This, the Payday 3 team has said, is to "ensure its stability".

Climbing is one of the great joys of video games. It's one of the things I am always looking out for. 
</p><p>
It felt like it was a rarity in games until something like Crackdown came along. I was a long way through Crackdown before I realised that it wasn't really about shooting people or driving cars - its purest pleasures involved navigating the game's complex interlocking 3D world. For years I described it as a platform game, until I had a chat with John from Digital Foundry, who argued that if it was a platforming game, it wasn't a brilliant one. He was right, of course. Crackdown's not a platforming game so much as a climbing game.
</p><p>
Now climbing games are much more common. Grow Home was a great climbing game. This year I've played demos for Jusant and Surmount, both of which handle climbing in their own ways. And thi
