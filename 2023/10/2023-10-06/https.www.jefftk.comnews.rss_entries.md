Sometimes people have something they want to say without it being
traceable back to their main identity, and on internet forums it's
common for people to use multiple accounts ("alts") for this.  As
machine learning software gets better, however, it becomes
increasingly practical to link a person's accounts.

A few months ago someone ran a <a href="https://archive.ph/ml2bI">simple</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylometry">stylometry</a> tool <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33755016">across Hacker
News comments</a>, and identified many alts, including one for the
site's founder.  To further demonstrate that this isn't just an
academic consideration, I recently did the same for LessWrong and the
EA Forum.  I'm not going to share the code or the probabilities it
generated, and I've only looked at the output enough to be pretty sure
it's working.  Trained on half of the data and tested on the other
half it was consistently able to link
