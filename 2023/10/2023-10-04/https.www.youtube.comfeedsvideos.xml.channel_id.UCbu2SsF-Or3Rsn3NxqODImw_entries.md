From the ancient origins of the Isu through to the stories of Desmond Miles and Layla Hassan in the modern day, via the Renaissance-set Ezio Auditore trilogy, this video breaks down the long and dense timeline of the Assassin’s Creed franchise.

The Assassins Creed franchise has a huge, sprawling timeline that spans well over 75,000 years, and plays out across a whopping 20-plus games… and counting. It truly is a colossal chronology, and its epic narrative of an ongoing war between the Assassins and the Templars spans from the myths of ancient Greece in Assassin’s Creed Odyssey to the present day sections of Assassin’s Creed 2, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla and Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag.

With Assassin’s Creed Mirage further expanding the timeline and detailing the origins of assassin Basim Ibn Ishaq, what better time to dive back into the rich lore lurking behind this epic franchise.

This is the Assassin’s Creed franchise fully explained.
