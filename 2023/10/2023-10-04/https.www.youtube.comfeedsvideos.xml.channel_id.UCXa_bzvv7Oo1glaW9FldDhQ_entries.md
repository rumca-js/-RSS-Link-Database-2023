Mirage is exactly what it says on the tin- an old-school stealth game made for the current market.

It's been almost six years since a new iteration of the Forza Motorsport series. Other racing games have come and gone, and worthy competitors have emerged, but Turn 10 Studios' racing sim has finally returned.

However, Forza Motorsport isn't a straightforward sequel. It's a reboot, revamping the core mechanics defining the series while rethinking its approach to racing. The result is a game that's distinctly Forza while setting new standards for what that means in 2023.

Nevertheless, whether you're a veteran or curious to jump in for the first, Forza Motorsport is a gorgeous and incredibly put-together racing sim, hampered only by scant technical issues. Check out our thoughts on what makes it so good before it releases on October 10th for Xbox Series X/S and PC.
