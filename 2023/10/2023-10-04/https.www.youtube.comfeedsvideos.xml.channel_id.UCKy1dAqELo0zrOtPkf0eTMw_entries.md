Check out the latest trailer for The Invincible to get another look at this upcoming hard sci-fi game.


The Invincible puts you in the role of Yasna, a sharp-tongued astrobiologist forced to search for her crew and bring them back “dead or alive” as a perilous mission to the eerie planet Regis III takes an awry turn. On the surface, it may seem that Regis III is uninhabited but that doesn't mean the people who visit here can feel like unopposed rulers. The philosophical nature of the events on Regis III will make Yasna forever question the scale of humankind's ambitions.


The Invincible will be available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S on November 6, 2023.

## Detective Pikachu Returns Review

Detective Pikachu Returns reviewed by Carli Velocci on Nintendo Switch.

The mystery story of Detective Pikachu Returns makes some bizarre and unexpectedly dark choices to get to its underwhelmingly predictable conclusion, and as a result it’s unclear who this is all for. Is it for young kids who will find the simplified puzzles about right, or adults who grew up with Pikachu and can handle the more mature themes of the second half? It’s still a cute, bubbly, animated adventure with humor, unique pokemon to meet, and a mystery to solve, but the mystery solving is long-winded, the visuals are lackluster, and the gameplay is so basic it might as well not be there at all.

EA Sports FC 24 reviewed by Andrew McMahon on Nintendo Switch.

The series formerly known as FIFA is no longer copying and pasting its work from previous years, but it's still sub-par on the Switch. The Frostbite engine is an improvement, but still a Sunday League without the other versions’ smooth HyperMotion animation tech. Its slow gameplay and poor framerate make new features like PlayStyles pretty much useless. And while Ultimate Team is no longer just the same version from FIFA 17, connection and matchmaking issues mean other modes like Volta and Clubs are almost unplayable at the moment.

Loki season 2, episodes 1-4 reviewed by Jarrod Jones.

Those expecting a new multiversally manic season of Loki should temper their expectations; the absence of director Kate Herron has seemingly removed the series’ wily sense of anything-goes possibility, effectively turning Season 2 – and, shockingly, Loki himself – into an obedient, uninteresting cog in the MCU’s increasingly unwieldy mega-structure.

Assassin's Creed Mirage returns to the root of the long-running franchise, and is more linearly focused than the recent expansive AC games. Check out the first 19 minutes of gameplay here in 4K in the game's 60 FPS performance mode on PlayStation 5!

Unlike some of the previous entries (Assassin's Creed Valhalla or Assassin's Creed Odyssey), AC Mirage mainly takes place in one giant area, the City of Baghdad. You play as Basim as he begins his journey with the Assassins, or as they are known in this time period, the Hidden Ones. Search for clues, pickpocket, hide in plain sight, and build up to major assassinations in this throwback to the origins of the franchise.

Assassin's Creed Mirage reviewed by Jarrett Green on PlayStation 5, also available on PlayStation 4, Xbox, and PC.

Assassin’s Creed Mirage’s return to the stealthy style that launched this series doesn’t do everything right, but everything it does feels like it was done with purpose. This means a shorter game with a smaller map, fewer collectibles, smaller scope in combat, and a limited selection of gear to play with – all of which is refreshing relative to the arguably bloated scale of 100-hour games like Odyssey and Valhalla. It’s easy to recommend Mirage to anyone who’s lapsed on Assassin’s Creed, as its back-to-basics approach is a successful first step in returning the feeling that the earlier industry-defining games gave us so long ago.

Forza Motorsport reviewed by Luke Reilly on Xbox Series X. Also available on Xbox Series S and PC.

"After six long years, Forza Motorsport is off the lift and back in our lives. It looks great, feels great, sounds great, and it’s brought with it the most impressive multiplayer we’ve seen in the series so far. With 500 cars and 20 track locations it’s hardly a small start but, now positioned as a platform, Forza Motorsport has the potential to expand into a seriously rich racing destination over the coming years. If Flight Simulator on four wheels is the plan, I’m here for it. First on the list of improvements Turn 10 should focus on is revamping the new RPG-inspired upgrade system that turns progression into an unnecessarily long road ahead of each individual car, and maybe bringing back the joys of split-screen multiplayer racing to complement the excellent online modes."

Station to Station reviewed by Seth Macy on PC.

Station to Station is a relaxing, cozy railway planner with clear goals, flexibility in how you accomplish them, and the absolute perfect amount of challenge. It doesn't try to be anything more than a fun and easy going experience, and the fact you can randomize levels and crank their difficulty up a bit provides some nice variety to how you approach each session.

Loki Season 2 is upon us, and if the Loki Season 2 trailer tells us anything, the future of the MCU depends on our favorite ne'er-do-well Loki. There will be plenty for Tom Hiddleston’s signature character to solve, plus Sylvie, He Who Remains, and maybe Kang (?) will all figure into the mix!
MCU fans think this troubled phase may all come down to Loki, so get ready for our breakdown of the journey of Loki -- his timeline as it has played out for many years of Marvel movies (and now shows too). Loki has had an extremely long, non-linear journey leading to the Disney+ Loki series. Loki, Thor, Sylvie, Mobius, Odin, Frigga, the Avengers, the TVA, several variants, and even more have brought our Loki to be the character he is. Let’s explore what exactly that means in our Loki: The Story So Far video!
