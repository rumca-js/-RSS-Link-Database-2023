<p>Lavish opening ceremony has been cancelled but hosts India are scoring faster and every country emphasises attack more</p><p>There is only one stadium in the world larger than the Narendra Modi Stadium and that, in Pyongyang, is unlikely to host cricket any time soon. Even when empty, a massive ring filled with 132,000 seats in bright orange, yellow and blue, Ahmedabad’s sporting superbowl is a remarkable sight. Before the World Cup, every available surface has been decorated in the tournament’s predominantly pink and purple livery and the result is, in the best possible way, like the aftermath of a riot in a poster-paint factory.</p><p>But step outside the ground – literally just outside, to the concrete concourse that encircles it, and anywhere beyond that – and there is little sign that this tournament exists.

On Tuesday, after a weeks-long struggle with his caucus to fund the government and avert a government shutdown had proved fruitless and Kevin McCarthy had at last conceded to compromise with the Democrats, Republicans, led by Florida’s Matt Gaetz and other members of the far-right, Trumpist Freedom Caucus, voted McCarthy out of the House speakership.</p><p>He is the first speaker of the House to ever be removed from his post by a vote – a technique that was only possible because McCarthy had made so many procedural concessions to get the speakership in the first place. It took McCarthy 15 votes to achieve the speakership when the Republicans took control of the House back in January; it took him 269 days to lose it. Now, the job will be someone else’s problem.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/comm

<p>The author sets out to discover what happened to her ancestors during the Holocaust in this gripping, poignant work</p><p>Anne Berest’s work of autofiction, a bestseller in France and a finalist for the Prix Goncourt, opens on a snowy Paris morning in 2003. The protagonist’s mother, Léila, steps outside for her first cigarette of the day, only to find a mysterious postcard in the mailbox. On it are four names: Ephraim, Emma, Noémie, Jacques. Her grandfather, grandmother, aunt and uncle – all killed at Auschwitz. No signature, no explanation. “Who could have sent me this terrible thing?”</p><p>For Léila, the postcard is a threat, a provocation. For Anne, it poses a question: why does she know so little about those ancestors? Her quest to find the sender will open rifts between mother and daughter; it will also unearth the family’s origin story. Their early years of wandering; their fate under Vichy France and the Nazis; the risks her grandparents undertook in the Resistance. And th
