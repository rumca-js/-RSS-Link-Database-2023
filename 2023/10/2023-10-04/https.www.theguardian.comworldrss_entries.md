<p>US student safety not improved by surveillance technology such as cameras and facial recognition software, research shows</p><p>An <a href="https://www.aclu.org/report/digital-dystopia-the-danger-in-buying-what-the-edtech-surveillance-industry-is-selling">ACLU report</a> has found that despite claims from companies, surveillance technology in US schools does not improve student safety and constant surveillance can, in fact, cause a number of harms to students including making students less likely to report dangerous behavior.</p><p>Schools typically use technologies such as cameras, facial recognition software and communication monitoring and filtering technology, which have been marketed by education technology surveillance companies as intervention tools against school shootings, suicides and bullying. In 2021, US schools and colleges spent $3.1bn on these products and this number is expected to grow by 8% every year, according to the report.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian

In February that year, he was diagnosed with two forms of mesothelioma, and told these types of cancer were only caused by asbestos exposure.

<p>Prime minister due to announce scrapping of northern leg of project after weeks of speculation</p><p>Good morning. Rishi Sunak will deliver his speech to the Conservative conference just before noon and it is now all but certain that he will use it to announce he is scrapping the HS2 line from Birmingham to Manchester. There was imaginative spin last night to the effect that the line would still be going ahead, but just on the existing tracks. But that is not high-speed rail, and so there is no avoiding the fact that phase two of the project is dead.</p><p>Sunak is expected to announce a raft of other transport projects in north which he hopes will persuade voters the Tory commitment to levelling up has not died too. And we are expecting plenty of other policy in the speech, in which he will try to make the case he is the leader best placed to fix the “broken system” at Westminster which has held back Britain in recent decades (during which his party has largely been in power).</p
