The diagrams are not meant to literally represent the particles and their interactions but rather a way to represent the mathematical formulas that describe them. They are extremely useful in quantum field theory and other areas of physics \u2013 Frank Wilczek, who won the 2004 Nobel Prize in Physics, credits Feynman diagrams as an invaluable tool in his research.\n\nDesigning your own notation can compress co", "link": "https://matt-rickard.com/the-benefit-of-a-personal-notation", "date_published": "2023-10-04T13:30:34+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "Matt Rickard", "album": "Matt Rickard", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://matt-rickard.com/favicon-32x32.png"}]
