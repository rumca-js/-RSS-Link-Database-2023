Check out the first 19 minutes of gameplay here in 4K in the game's 60 FPS performance mode on PlayStation 5!\n\nUnlike some of the previous entries (Assassin's Creed Valhalla or Assassin's Creed Odyssey), AC Mirage mainly takes place in one giant area, the City of Baghdad. You play as Basim as he begins his journey with the Assassins, or as they are known in this time period, the Hidden Ones. Search for clues, pickpocket, hide in plain sight, and build up to major assassinations in this throwback to the origins of the franchise.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #AssassinsCreed", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxUPhF2p6Pw", "date_published": "2023-10-04T11:00:09+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "Ign - YouTube", "album": "Ign - YouTube", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/BxUPhF2p6Pw/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Assassin's Creed Mirage Review", "description": "Assassin's Creed Mirage reviewed by Jarrett Green on PlayStation 5, also available on PlayStation 4, Xbox, and PC.\n\nAssassin\u2019s Creed Mirage\u2019s return to the stealthy style that launched this series doesn\u2019t do everything right, but everything it does feels like it was done with purpose. This means a shorter game with a smaller map, fewer collectibles, smaller scope in combat, and a limited selection of gear to play with \u2013 all of which is refreshing relative to the arguably bloated scale of 100-hour games like Odyssey and Valhalla.

Also available on Xbox Series S and PC.\n\n\"After six long years, Forza Motorsport is off the lift and back in our lives. It looks great, feels great, sounds great, and it\u2019s brought with it the most impressive multiplayer we\u2019ve seen in the series so far. With 500 cars and 20 track locations it\u2019s hardly a small start but, now positioned as a platform, Forza Motorsport has the potential to expand into a seriously rich racing destination over the coming years. If Flight Simulator on four wheels is the plan, I\u2019m here for it. First on the list of improvements Turn 10 should focus on is revamping the new RPG-inspired upgrade system that turns progression into an unnecessarily long road ahead of each individual car, and maybe bringing back the joys of split-screen multiplayer racing to complement the excellent online modes.\"", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DG-KRYWyxE4", "date_published": "2023-10-04T07:01:00+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "Ign - YouTube", "album": "Ign - YouTube", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/DG-KRYWyxE4/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Station to Station Review", "description": "Station to Station reviewed by Seth Macy on PC.\n\nStation to Station is a relaxing, cozy railway planner with clear goals, flexibility in how you accomplish them, and the absolute perfect amount of challenge.

Loki has had an extremely long, non-linear journey leading to the Disney+ Loki series. Loki, Thor, Sylvie, Mobius, Odin, Frigga, the Avengers, the TVA, several variants, and even more have brought our Loki to be the character he is.
