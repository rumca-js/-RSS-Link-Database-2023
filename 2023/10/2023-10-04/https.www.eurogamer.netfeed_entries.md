A group of former BioWare staff members has launched a lawsuit to seek better severance pay from the maker of Mass Effect and Dragon Age. 
</p><p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-lays-off-50-employees-as-part-of-shift-towards-a-more-agile-and-more-focused-studio">50 staff were let go in August</a>, as part of a move the company said would make the studio "more agile and more focused". Several veteran team members were included in the cuts, including two writers who had each worked at the studio for over 20 years.

Now, a group of seven people - with an average of 14 years at BioWare between them - have requested further compensation from the company, with a payout calculated to take their years of service into consideration.

Twitch has seen another round of layoffs, though full details are unknown.
</p><p>
The news comes from streaming insider <a href="https://twitter.com/zachbussey/status/1709215502881484865">Zack Bussey</a> and has since been corroborated by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/twitch-makes-another-round-of-layoffs">GamesIndustry.biz</a>.

The bottom of Elephant Mario's feet are pink and can't be changed due to how the model is structured, Unreal notes, but I rather like it. It makes it look like he's got a bunch of toe beans on his soles. </p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/m

What would a world shared by humans and Pok&eacute;mon really be like? It's something I imagine every Pok&eacute;fan has pondered, and yet it's also something the series' main games typically do a poor job of showing. Red and Blue, Gold and Silver, all the way to Scarlet and Violet - the story never really changes. You play as the 10-year-old version of an RPG murder hobo, storming about capturing monsters to defeat enemies, then storing said creatures inside a computer when they're no longer of use. I've always held a softer spot for the Pok&eacute;mon anime, which offers a more slice-of-life take on the traditional Pok&eacute;mon game story, and better features the other kinds of people who exist in the series' world. It's been interesting to see, over the years, the wider Pok&eacute;mon franchise include more of the anime's elements e

A new report has alleged that Hyenas, the recently cancelled space-set loot shooter from Creative Assembly, was Sega's "biggest budget game ever".

YouTube channel Volound shared an eye-opening video on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-has-cancelled-hyenas">recent cancellation</a>, with claims from anonymous developers detailing a "total lack of direction" around the game, with one contributor stating many members of the leadership team were "asleep at the wheel but they never seemed to lose their jobs". The same source noted an engine change and "not committing to doing anything adventurous with the game" were all part of Hyenas' ultimate demise.

Another contributor said that internal feedback on the game was poor, adding it was felt that Hyenas would "melt into the background of an already saturated mul

Eric 'ConcernedApe' Barone, the creator of beloved farming sim Stardew Valley, has celebrated one million followers by sharing four new screenshots of forthcoming next game Haunted Chocolatier.
</p><p>
Shared on X, formerly Twitter, the four screenshots show some new areas: an interior home and shop, a vivid forest, a mermaid fountain in (presumably) the town square, and a creepy library with a peering skeleton.
</p><p>
That forest screenshot also shows the character shooting at a leafy creature with a bow and arrow, suggestive of the increased combat focus compared with Stardew.

Reader, I am in love with the House of Wisdom. Who wouldn't be? A vast palace of books with thick walls, beautiful ceramic window inlays and plenty of what the Californian real estate industry would refer to as an enviable indoor/outdoor flow. In the 9th Century, when Assassin's Creed Mirage is set, the House of Wisdom was one of the biggest libraries that had ever existed, mounted like a jewel inside a ringed city, Baghdad, that was on its way to being the largest city in the world. All of the Golden Age is visible here: the love of learning, of curating the lessons of the past but also looking to the future. Criers invite people for what amounts to TED Talks on astronomy, on the use of the astrolabe. Celebrity poets argue in the courtyards. Political intrigue is everywhere you look. Everybody has heard a rumour about something o

Nintendo has announced it is ending online play services for both the 3DS and Wii U. These services will be terminated "as of early April 2024," the company wrote in an update earlier today. 
</p><p>
Nintendo has been steadily winding down its support for these older consoles, having sunsetted the eShop for both platforms last year. Of course, this had no effect on the online play capabilities of the games. 
</p><p>
However, as of April next year, games on either the Wii U or 3DS will only be playable offline. This means "online cooperative play, internet rankings and data distribution" will also be affected. It also means no more online town hopping in Animal Crossing: New Leaf (pictured above).

In the view of Forza Motorsport, cars are serious business. This you can tell from the score, by Peter G. Holmstr&ouml;m, which is laden with hammer blows and ticking synth. It sounds like the work of Hans Zimmer, and you could lift it out and lay it snugly over a Splinter Cell or a Deus Ex - one of those tech-infested thrillers in which the world is redeemed by hardware, and the solitary souls who guide it. (Such is racing, I guess, in the eyes of its admirers.) This approach differs from that of Gran Turismo 7, the chief rival of Forza Motorsport in the mainstream simulator stakes. That game presents its races in a caf&eacute;, amid the glint of coffee pots and the steam of lightly brewed jazz. Slotted together, both works spin and blur into a similar conviction; when you apply the brakes, you notice that they lie at o
