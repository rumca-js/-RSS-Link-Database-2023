In short, EA's latest football sim introduces a number of subtle improvements to its on-pitch action while sprinkling in some incremental additions to long-standing game modes like Ultimate Team and Career. It still offers an exciting, albeit familiar, game of back-and-forth football, but the demanding yearly release schedule isn't doing the series any favors. Even with the fancy new rebrand, EA FC is an expected follow-up to FIFA 23, offering a slight evolution rather than anything revelatory.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">As is often the case from one game to the next, the pace of play in EA FC 24 feels a tad slower compared to last year.

It's purposely much more like the older games that predate Assassin's Creed Origins and the run of lengthy RPG experiences. That means the world feels both more tightly constructed and <em>much</em> smaller by design. With that comes a shorter playtime too.
