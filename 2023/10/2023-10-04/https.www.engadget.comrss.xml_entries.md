<p>Patreon <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://news.patreon.com/articles/patreon-reimagined">announced</a> a rebranding of its platform through a series of updates on Wednesday. New features give creators more personalization and control while offering supporters more ways to follow their favorites. In addition, the platform is integrating more free content, allowing every creator to host communities non-paying members can access. Patreon also tweaked its branding with a new logo, color themes, photography and fonts.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most notable update for creators is the ability to bolster their communities for free members. Creators can now let people join for free, offering content and updates for non-paying members while (optionally) hiding things like early access to podcasts or videos behind a paywall. They can also use a new commerce tool to sell individual pieces of content like recordings, videos and downloadable files. It makes the platform more of an all-in-one s

The 2010 open-world Western <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-original-red-dead-redemption-is-coming-to-ps4-and-switch-165058354.html">launched on PS4 and Switch</a> in August but only runs at 30fps on those platforms —&nbsp;a point many fans took issue with. PS5 owners will now see smoother framerates when playing the title in backward compatibility mode.</p>
<p>Rockstar updated the game with patch 1.03, pushed to PlayStation owners on Tuesday. The patch notes state the higher framerates are only available to PS5 owners, not the standard PS4 or even the more powerful <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-11-07-sony-playstation-4-pro-review.html">PS4 Pro</a>.

<p>Google is infusing its new Pixel 8 phones with generative AI, adding support for on-demand summarization, translation and read-aloud features in articles and web pages, plus more tricks. All of this is handled through the Assistant, either via spoken word or on-screen prompts.</p>
<p>On Pixel 8s, the Assistant will be able to quickly summarize website text, offering a breakdown of the page and bullet points of relevant content. It's a lot like interacting with Bard or Bing AI, in this regard. Prompts will pop up at the bottom of the summary with potential follow-ups — an article about iPhones, for example, will end with action buttons reading, “About iPhones,” and, “Who invented the iPhone?”</p>

<p>Reddit is revamping search and making a key feature of its app more accessible. The company announced a series of updates it says makes search faster and easier across its app and mobile site.</p>
<p>The changes include a new “media” tab in search and within individual subreddits so users can more easily browse images, video clips, and GIFs. Additionally, search results in Reddit’s app and website are getting a simpler, cleaner look.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Google has committed to providing seven full years of software support for it's Pixel phones, the company announced Wednesday during its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-2023-liveblog-live-updates-on-the-pixel-8-reveal-130029820.html">Made by Google event</a>. That might not be all that exciting to shoppers, at least compared to new hardware or OS features, but it puts Google well ahead of the competition — and may ultimately be a boon for both consumers and the environment.</p>
<p>Previously, Google's policy on updates to support its phones was five years (at least for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230315091807/https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705?hl=en">Pixel 6 and later</a>), which in itself was nothing to scoff at. Not only will an extra two years potentially save consumers from shelling out for a brand new handset, but it may save some aging Pixels from ending up in a landfill quite as quickly.

<p>On Wednesday at its annual hardware event, Google announced its next flagship phone: <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N0b3JlLmdvb2dsZS5jb20vP2hsPWVuLVVTIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyMDBiODI5OS03YzFhLTQ2NzAtODc3Zi0zMmQ1YTRjMDYxYTAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAXV91-Eeg5JXmshLd2BUrx-pqiN6k4hkAlC0WEXeS1hW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.google.com%2F%3Fhl%3Den-US">the Pixel 8 Pro</a>. Starting at $999, it costs $100 more than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-7-and-pixel-7-pro-review-still-the-best-bargain-in-flagship-phones-170031940.html">its predecessor</a>, so to make up for that increased price Google added a number of enhanced photo and video features, a new temperature sensor and seven years of software support.</p>

## Google's Pixel 8 is a smaller 6.2-inch flagship with a bigger battery

<p>Google's new Pixel 8 comes with upgrades to all the major smartphone specs this year, but in a slightly smaller package. The 6.2-inch screen is smaller than the display found on the Pixel 7 (which was smaller than the Pixel 6 before that). However, the newest Pixel has the same 1,080 x 2,400 resolution. Google's Actua OLED technology promises vivid color and details, at up to 1400 nits of brightness. That's 40 percent brighter than last year's Google flagship.</p>
<p>Last year's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-7-and-pixel-7-pro-review-still-the-best-bargain-in-flagship-phones-170031940.html">Pixel 7</a> had a 90Hz screen, while Pixel 8 has a dynamic display with 60-120Hz refresh rates. Alongside a smaller display, this year's Pixel 8 comes with a larger battery (minimum 4,485mAh), which together, should lead to improved battery life. It'll also pack fast charging, which can top-up up to 50% charge in around 30 minutes.</p>

The Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro look largely the same as their predecessors, with a couple of key differences. The regular Pixel 8 is slightly smaller, which makes it easier to use with one hand. Meanwhile, the Pro model has a new matte finish, upgraded cameras and an intriguing temperature sensor.</p>
<p>Across the Pixel 8 series, we’re also getting the company’s Tensor G3 processor, Assistant improvements and, notably, seven whole years of Android and security updates. So, you might actually be able to hang on to your Pixel flagship for a lot longer than before. Now we’ll just have to wait and see if the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro do enough for you to <em>want</em> to keep them around for years to come.</p>

As ever, Pixel users will be able to download the new version of the operating system first on supported models (Pixel 4a and newer). Compatible Samsung Galaxy, iQOO, Nothing, OnePlus, Oppo, Realme, Sharp, Sony, Tecno, vivo and Xiaomi devices will gain access to Android 14 later this year.</p>
<p>Deeper customization is a major focus this time around. You'll be able to choose from a variety of lock screen templates. There's the option to add new clocks and shortcuts (such as the QR reader or the Google Home app) to the lock screen for swift access. Switching between wallpapers should be easier too.</p>

<p>When Google debuted <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-watch-review-battery-life-fitbit-heart-rate-sensing-015412121.html">the Pixel Watch last year</a>, hopes were high that it would be a real rival for the Apple Watch. But, due to subpar battery life and some friction around integrating Fitbit’s health-tracking features, the company failed to deliver a truly satisfying contender. The hype for the Pixel Watch 2 is significantly less than for its predecessor, and Google needs to convince us it adds enough to justify an upgrade.</p>
<p>From the outside, the Pixel Watch 2 brings a fairly modest set of updates, but it offers some compelling new features that could make it one of the best health and wellness-tracking wearables around. At a starting price of $350, the Pixel Watch 2 sits between the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-hands-on-the-spinning-bezels-triumphant-return-110047694.html">$300 Galaxy Watch 6 and the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic</a>, as

<p>Google’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-watch-2022-announcement-141418770.html">Pixel Watch</a> had years of development time but it still managed to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-watch-review-battery-life-fitbit-heart-rate-sensing-015412121.html">stumble</a> rather than sprint out of the gate. A year later, and the company is hoping it’s a good time to make a better first impression with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-watch-2-hands-on-new-biometric-sensors-in-a-slightly-lighter-package-143002557.html">Pixel Watch 2</a>. Google says the new wearable has better health and fitness tracking, paired with far sturdier battery life and better integration with its services. And its case is reportedly made out of 100 percent recycled aluminum, to help bolster its green bona fides. But, as pretty as that first-generation watch was, it’s time to see if the company has the gear to back up its many promises.</p>

The novel translation feature, which Engadget tested earlier this year, uses the phone’s folding display to translate both sides of a live conversation.</p>
<p>Dual-screen interpreter mode uses the Pixel Fold’s inner and outer screens to let two people who speak different languages speak face to face, viewing the other person's translated words on their screen in real time. For example, the Pixel Fold owner holds the device while viewing the other person’s live-translated text on the inner screen. Meanwhile, the other person will see the Pixel owner’s spoken words tran

Chesky wants Airbnb to expand its focus and is currently planning a push into long-term rentals. The service already offers monthly rentals, but apparently, only 18 percent of gross nights booked in the second quarter of 2023 come from stays longer than 30 days. Chesky believes the company can do more to drum up interest in long-term bookings and that offering rentals for up to a year represents a &quot;huge opportunity.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>A Florida-based company called X Social Media has accused Elon Musk’s X Corp. of trademark and service mark <a href="https://www.engadget.com/x-sues-x-in-trademark-infringement-lawsuit-092041443.html">infringement</a>. With SpaceX, AI venture xAI (not to mention the brief existence of banking startup x.com), Musk <em>really</em> loves the letter X. At the time of the renaming, trademark attorney Josh Gerben told <em>Reuters</em> there was “about a 100 percent probability that both opportunistic and legitimate plaintiffs will sue Twitter/X over the new name.” Conveniently, Gerben’s law firm is representing the plaintiff in this case.</p>
<p>X Social Media says it’s “offered its advertising and social media services connecting law firms and those in need of advocates since 2016.” While its logo looks vastly different from the logo used by the social network formerly known as Twitter, it apparently “frequently emphasizes the ‘X’ portion of its mark throughout its advertising.” The pl
