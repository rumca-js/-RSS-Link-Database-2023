With luck, it&rsquo;ll continue getting better in the lead up to October 10 and 11. The cost of solid-state drives have tumbled this year. All our recommended deals are all-time low prices (or very near it).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get the best prices, you&rsquo;ll need an Amazon Prime subscription, as the discounts are only available to members. Good news is, getting<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/402239/how-to-get-amazon-prime-for-free.html\"> Amazon Prime for free</a> is easy. Not interested in Prime, but still want to save money? We&rsquo;re also keeping an eye out for sales at rival stores, like Newegg.

First, to see <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2079103/hands-on-with-surface-laptop-go-3-and-surface-studio-2.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft&rsquo;s latest offerings for the Surface line</a>, which took a backseat to the AI-infused update to Windows 11. And second to see <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2085741/2085741.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Google reveal its Chromebook Plus push</a>, a new standard for the company&rsquo;s OS along with its hardware partners. And at the end of it all I had to ask myself: What the hell is Microsoft thinking?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Never mind the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2081319/the-new-windows-ai-tools-arent-ready-for-prime-time.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2089601/google-just-gave-microsoft-a-budget-laptop-beat-down.html", "date_published": "2023-10-04T11:30:00+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "PC world", "album": "PC world", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "I\u2019m a longtime PC builder, but this boutique PC taught me a few lessons", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Building your own gaming PC is one of the most satisfying experiences you can have in the hardware world. You&rsquo;ve got the entire arsenal of PC hardware and components to choose from. If you&rsquo;re up to the challenge, it&rsquo;s fun to make these parts all work brilliantly together. Sometimes, things go wrong &mdash; and you learn, and do it again better in the future. In the end, you&rsquo;re left with a sense of satisfaction if you stick with it. Did we mention it&rsquo;s often cheaper, too?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you&rsquo;re a seasoned PC builder yourself, what lessons could you learn from a custom, boutique PC? That&rsquo;s the question I asked myself. After having built dozens upon dozens of gaming PCs for fun (and for science!), I decided to order a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.falcon-nw.com/desktops/tiki&", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2085780/im-a-longtime-pc-builder-but-this-boutique-pc-taught-me-a-few-lessons.html", "date_published": "2023-10-04T10:30:00+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "PC world", "album": "PC world", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": null}]
