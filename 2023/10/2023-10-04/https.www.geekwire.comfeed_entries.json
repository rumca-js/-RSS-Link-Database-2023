The system recently returned from an airport in Fairbanks, Alaska, where it put a dent in 20,000 gallons of toxic, PFAS-contaminated wastewater that had accumulated for 40 years. For decades companies have added PFAS to firefighting foams, food packaging, carpets and fabrics, water-repellent clothing and non-stick pans.
