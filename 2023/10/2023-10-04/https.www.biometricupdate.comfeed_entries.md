		Early reactions to a report that the UK's police minister wants people in a permanent biometric crime lineup are not overly positive.

It is being called "Orwellian" in the opinion outlet The European Conservative, for example.

Minister <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202309/facial-recognition-will-transform-investigative-work-says-uks-top-cop">Chris Philp</a> has said he wants, within two years, infrastructure and software in place that enables police to compare CCTV images against the nation's passport and immigration photo databases.

Philp <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202310/uk-minister-wants-police-biometric-passport-database-searches-to-catch-shoplifters">has said </a>there are no legal restrictions stopping the plan. The College of Policing,

		Digital public infrastructure (DPI) projects, including digital IDs, are gaining more ground as part of the fight against poverty. During UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Action Week in September, global stakeholders promised to raise <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202309/400m-mobilized-to-support-digital-public-infrastructure-development-in-100-countries">$400 million</a> for DPI projects before 2030.

This week saw an update on an ambitious digital ID project for financial inclusion in Africa while experts from the Global South called for more funding, increased transparency and better infrastructure in order to fast-track DPI projects.

		The Swedish government is rushing to prepare the public for expanded police use of biometric systems including those monitoring from traffic stanchions and drones.

Gang violence that includes firearms and explosives has pushed the government and a far-Right conservative party to examine the proposed surveillance change in a fast-tracked inquiry, according to local reports.

The nation's justice minister this week said the inquiry will be completed in half the usual time for such a body. A finding could be published by spring. Government inquiries generally are used to bury a topic or to show the public an action has been thought through. The latter is more likely in this case.
