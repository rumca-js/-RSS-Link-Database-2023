<p>Between excellent remakes, surprise hit indie games, and the gaming industry duking it out with AAA blockbusters, some games were bound to get overlooked in a year of non-stop hits. Is the latest EA Originals game Immortals of Aveum one of those titles? That's up for debate, but it is a fact that the spell-slinging blaster did find itself sandwiched between <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Madden-NFL-24-PlayStation-5/dp/B0C6NDYH6Z?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">Madden NFL 24</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Armored-Core-VI-Fires-Rubicon-PlayStation/dp/B0BX4KZ5PJ?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon</a>, and Sea of Stars this year.

<p>Actor and writer Donald Glover has shared his thoughts on artificial intelligence, and he is cautiously optimistic about the potential for the technology to help do good things. Speaking to <a href="https://www.complex.com/music/a/eric-skelton/donald-glover-interview-quiet-comfort">Complex</a>, the actor said there is "a good reason to be cautious" about AI. Right now, the conversation around AI, as he sees it, is focusing on "the scary stuff" and not how AI "can actually help us solve these problems that we have."</p><p>"I get it. It is scary on some level. But I'm like, you could band together and do something really cool with it. Like, something really new. And you can do all that stuff faster. You know, AI's not gonna take your job, the person who's really good at AI is gonna take your job," he said.</p><p>Glover said he is in favor of legislation pertaining to AI, though he doubts this will actually happen. The Atlanta star said what's scary to people about AI is that it feel

<p>The acclaimed RPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/">Baldur's Gate 3</a> has received a number of major patches since its release earlier this year. As its name implies, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/3716089610947840482">Hotfix 8</a> is focused on more minor issues with the game, but it also shaves the game's lovable Sphynx cat His Majesty once again. It also adjusted Steelclaw's eye color, so the two of them are no longer identical twins.</p><p dir="ltr">You can find the full patch notes below, but they essentially boil down to a number of bugs being squashed. For example, companions will no longer transfer story items to the player when they're dismissed, which is how things worked back in Patch 2. The hotfix also resolves several crashes that ended multiplayer games, including one that triggered during dialogue after an active roll. The patch also corrects Raphael's portrait, giving him the correct hair color once again. Als

<p>Marvel Studios set up Kang the Conqueror, played by Jonathan Majors, to be the next big bad for their wave of movies and television series for years to come. He debuted at the end of Loki Season 1 as He Who Remains, another Kang variant but was killed by Sylvie--a Loki variant played by Sophia Di Martino. Kang will also appear in Loki Season 2 as one of his variants Victor Timely as well (as also seen in the Quantumania post-credit scene).</p><p>However, the uncertainty of Majors' pending lawsuit has already had some effect on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jonathan-majors-dropped-from-movies-ad-campaign-amid-domestic-assault-allegations/1100-6513365/">the actor's career</a>, but it wouldn't affect the production of the upcoming Loki season.

<p dir="ltr">Loki Season 2 is an exemplary example of the state of the Marvel Cinematic Universe these days. As a production, it's immaculate. It's very well put-together with even better production design than the first season had, we've got a stellar cast without any annoying characters, and it doesn't over-indulge itself on fake-looking CGI sets. However, as a story, I can't tell if it's a carefully layered mystery or just another massively rejiggered MCU plot that doesn't end up meaning much of anything.</p><p dir="ltr">After watching four of the six episodes of Loki Season 2, I'm leaning toward the latter--but the pieces are there for them to prove me wrong.</p><p dir="ltr">The show starts off on the wrong foot in that regard, because it doesn't actually address what the cliffhanger from the end of Season 1 was about. Oh, I've got a pretty good theory--though I'll spare you the spoilers for now--but the answer isn't given in the episodes that were shown to critics.</p><a href="h

<p dir="ltr">Nintendo's previous WarioWare game for Switch, Get It Together, was divisive. While I <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/warioware-get-it-together-review-a-platform-for-change/1900-6417725/">enjoyed it well enough</a> for what it was, it was a huge change of pace for the series, due to its focus on adding characters with unique abilities that were used to solve puzzles in different ways. For Wario's second microgame outing on Switch, WarioWare: Move It, Nintendo has ditched that to focus purely on microgames that function as quick non sequiturs, requiring you to figure out the goal and quickly execute a solution. And as the name implies, it also reintroduces this in the context of movement-based microgames using the Joy-Con controllers. That's right: waggle is back, baby.</p><p dir="ltr">WarioWare isn't exactly trying to hide the connection. The game revolves around posing in different "Forms" exactly like in the Wii game Smooth Moves, so the individual games rely
