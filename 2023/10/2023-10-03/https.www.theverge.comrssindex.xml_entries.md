  <p id="4TIp6B">Samsung’s FE series is back after a year off, this time with a pair of Galaxy Buds in the mix. </p>
<p id="3A21KT">The Galaxy S23 FE has the specs we’d expect of a “value flagship” smartphone and a price that makes more sense: $599, rather than the $699 Samsung charged for the S21 FE. The Galaxy Tab S9 FE comes with robust water and dust resistance and a much friendlier $449 price tag than the pricey standard S9, which starts at $799 — but you’ll have to settle for an LCD panel rather than OLED. And the Galaxy Buds FE offer active noise cancellation for $99.</p>

And a software trick allows you to add a portrait mode blur effect after a photo is taken. These are some of the small changes that make for a better experience

  <p id="AxBBIs">A hit-and-run in San Francisco last night “launched” a pedestrian in front of a Cruise robotaxi, the company said Tuesday. The robotaxi “braked aggressively to minimize impact,” while the driver of the other vehicle fled the scene. The condition of the struck pedestrian is unknown at this time. </p>
<p id="UEGVCW">The crash was the latest in San Francisco to involve a driverless vehicle, as hundreds more have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/10/23827790/waymo-cruise-cpuc-vote-robotaxi-san-francisco">hit the road recently for 24/7 commercial service</a>.

  <p id="jngDeW">Epic Games will be introducing age ratings to all <em>Fortnite</em> experiences starting later this year. The new system will go into effect on November 14th and will include “all first and third party playable content” in the game, which basically means everything built in the Creative mode. The ratings will be powered by the <a href="https://globalratings.com/">International Age Rating Coalition</a>, which works with the likes of the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) and Pan-European Game Information (PEGI).</p>

  <p id="VhgsZh">Ford announced a new “Flash” trim of the model year 2024 F-150 Lighting, with a bigger screen, longer range, and a heat pump to help improve battery conditioning on those colder days. The company said it is also expecting to make more F-150 Lightning deliveries to customers later this year after a factory shutdown restricted Ford’s supply of the electric truck. </p>
<p id="oEJQTw">Ford says it is targeting an EPA-estimated range for Flash of 320 miles, which would fit neatly in between the automaker’s Standard Range and Long Range models. The F-150 Lightning Standard Range typically gets less than 300 miles of EPA-estimated range, while Extended Range variants can travel as far as 350
