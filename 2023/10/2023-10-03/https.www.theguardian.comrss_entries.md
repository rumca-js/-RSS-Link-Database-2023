<p>My friend David John, who has died aged 95, was an artist and sculptor who played a notable part in raising the quality of Catholic church furnishings in the postwar decades.</p><p>David’s first major commissions were with the Liverpool architect FX (Francis Xavier) Velarde, providing sculpture and furnishings for the shrine church of Our Lady of Lourdes, Blackpool (1955-57), and St Luke, Pinner (1958).

## The truth about wrinkles: what are they – and what do they really say about our skin?

<p>The human face shows the most visible signs of ageing – from frown lines to crows’ feet. But some scientists suspect wrinkles could also be driving the ageing process</p><p>The face is like a party balloon. At the height of the fun it is plump and firm, the skin is taut, the surface smooth. It <em>shines</em> with good health. But once the games are done and the cake demolished, there’s a perceptible sense of deflation: the firmness goes, the structure sags, the surface dulls and wrinkles.</p><p>As the most exposed area of human skin, the face is prone to wrinkling. It is here that all the factors that drive their formation come together in one place. There’s the raft of intrinsic changes that see the skin become thinner, weaker and less elastic, while the supporting muscle, bone and fat decreases. There’s the extrinsic ageing due to sun damage, smoking, poor diet and pollution that accelerate the tissue’s decline. And then there’s the impact of physical demands: when we raise our

Eight months after they delayed <strong>Kevin McCarthy</strong>’s election as speaker of the House of Republicans for days, far-right Republicans are now moving to boot him out of the job, and it may be up to Democrats to save him – should they choose to do so.

<p>The Panorama investigation teased for a week turned out to be yet another revelation about men in power preying on the vulnerable. This time, will it lead to positive change?</p><p>Monday’s Panorama had – I believe uniquely in the programme’s 70-year history, and certainly for the first time since social media came into being – been teased for a week. The results of a special investigation would be revealed, it promised, but gave no further clues and managed to avoid any leaks. In what felt like a slightly distasteful move, capitalising on the grim story and therefore the alleged victims’ suffering, the announcement came after the Russell Brand rape and sexual harassment allegations. Imaginations were duly seized and speculation mounted that it would be something similarly celebrity-led. If not, it would be something constitutionally weighty that was more in keeping with the BBC’s flagship current-affairs programme. The revelation of another Partygate-type scandal perhaps, or the

One of the greatest Manchester City footballers who went on to become a successful businessman and chairman of the club<p>The footballer Francis Lee, who has died aged 79, was a prolific striker who won the First Division title with Manchester City in 1968 and then did the same with Derby County in 1975. Up front in various positions for England he was also a highly effective operator, including at the 1970 World Cup finals in Mexico, where he appeared in celebrated matches against Brazil and West Germany.</p><p>Short and stocky, golden-haired, self-confident and tenacious, Lee also won the FA Cup, the League Cup and the European Cup Winners’ Cup during a glorious period with City, for whom he was the leading goal scorer across five seasons, partly thanks to his great ability at winning and taking penalties. For England he scored 10 goals in 27 appearances between 1968 and 1972.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/03/francis-lee-obituary">Continue reading...</a

<p>The towering Slovenian striker followed in the footsteps of Haaland at Salzburg and now stands in Manchester City’s path</p><p>When Erling Haaland looks across the centre circle at kick-off on Wednesday night he may, at first, wonder whether he has glimpsed his own reflection. RB Leipzig have the option of fielding a young, 6ft 4in product of the Red Bull Salzburg machine with a prolific goalscoring record to accompany frightening physical and technical attributes. Benjamin Sesko is destined to become a household name and could press himself into the wider consciousness during Manchester City’s visit to Germany.</p><p>Sesko and Haaland were ships in the night when, four years ago, they briefly coincided on Salzburg’s books. While the Norwegian earned himself a move to Borussia Dortmund, his junior clubmate was scoring goals in the Uefa Youth League and taking notes on first-team games from the side. As far as Sesko remembers there was just one meeting between the pair when travell

<p>From the National to U2 and Taylor Swift, artists are digging beyond their best-known songs to affirm the connection they share with their loyal fans</p><p>When you’ve seen a band play live 34 times, they can only surprise you so much. Not only do you know the recorded songs intimately, but the nuances of how they perform them live: the singer’s rakish gestures, the guitarists’ live-wire body language, the unexpected moments of violence. But on the second of two nights at Alexandra Palace last week, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/the-national">the National</a> played an entirely different set to the one I had seen the night before: no repeated songs across a performance that lasted two and a half hours.</p><p>I had also been to see them in Dublin a week prior, so this set took me into the eighth hour of seeing them live in seven days. Yet, knowing that they had dispensed with most of the hits on Tuesday, on Wednesday I felt like a spoilt kid on Christmas morning as the

<p>For years, the island’s cuisine – from boba to bao – has been mistaken for ‘Chinese food’</p><p>It always warrants a double take. This time, I was in Malmö, Sweden, admiring the cobblestone pavement and enjoying the cool, crisp weather, when the sign came into view: “Yi Fang Taiwan Fruit Tea” it said, next to a line of Chinese script. I recognised the brand immediately. Yi Fang is a Taiwanese bubble tea chain with outposts in more than a dozen countries across the world – it’s a store I have seen multiple times around the block in Taipei where I live.</p><p>It may not be as surprising to discover such a shop in Sweden today as it would have been 10 years ago but, as a Taiwanese American food writer, I couldn’t help but think about the remarkable globalisation of my island’s cuisine. I also made a mental note that if I needed a hug from home, an ice-cold cup of bubble tea would be within easy reach.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/oct/03/bubble-tea-bao-g

<p>In an extract from his memoir, the 13-year NBA veteran reveals the childhood tragedy he has kept secret for more than 30 years</p><p>I’ve never told anyone this before, but my best friend died in my arms – and it was all because of basketball. It’s a day I’ve kept tucked away in a corner of my mind for over 30 years, like the carefully folded contents of a weathered trunk, buried behind cobwebs and cardboard boxes in the farthest corner of an attic. Until I started writing this book, I hadn’t spoken about what happened to anyone, including my parents and siblings. It’s a guarded memory I’ve only revisited in moments of solitude on my road to the NBA, and I debated dredging up the past when my family has always been about moving forward. Still, what happened changed the course of my life, as well as theirs, and I can’t possibly tell my story without it.</p><p>When it happened, Chris was seven and I was six. We were two inseparable bundles of energy who lived in neighboring tenement

Affectionate, loyal, endlessly patient – even when my baby son whacks him with a hairbrush, or yanks his tail, he never swipes.

I think of him as a sort of honoured house guest. He really is the very best of cats.</p><p>The two kings of the pet world, dogs and cats, inspire desperate tribalism from their respective camps.

Sniffing out a couple of suckers, Michael and an associate talk up a supply they don’t have. (“Do you know where this stuff comes from? It comes from Maryland,” says Michael. “That means it’s good,” says his cohort.) They set out to scam the buyers by taking the $40 in cash, dropping them off on another corner and driving off to their secret stash of nonexistent fireworks. But as they pull away, they realize their marks have stiffed them by only giving them $20. So they decide to clock out for the night and go to the movies.</p><p>There’s nothing in th

There’s the inherent tension between Ukrainians and Russians, symbolised in the marriage between Ukrainian wife Irka (Oxana Cherkashyna) and ethnically Russian husband Tolik (Sergiy Shadrin); the interventionist forces from Russia and Chechnya we see tramping through the area stirring up hatred and bloodshed; and the fatal blend of machismo, sheer fecklessness and trigger-happiness that causes stupid acts of destruction. In the space of a single opening shot that pans 360 degrees around one room, heavily pregnant Irka and Tolik go from being ordinary expectant parents, cheerfully bickering over where Irka’s hospital bag i

<p>JK Rowling, as Robert Galbraith, is back with a cult classic, while elsewhere past crimes make for gripping reads</p><p>I would describe myself as a fan of JK Rowling’s Robert Galbraith novels – if there is one thing Rowling/Galbraith does well, it is creating a cast of characters to root for, whether that’s Harry, Ron and Hermione, or her private investigators Cormoran Strike and Robin Ellacott and their will-we-ever-admit-our-feelings dance. But I didn’t love the previous novel in the series; <em>The Ink Black Heart</em>, which centred on online persecution of a murder victim, had a bitter, angry vibe and far too much transcription of internet chat. <strong><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-running-grave-9781408730942">The Running Grave</a></strong> (Sphere) thankfully steers clear of such topics, and is much more enjoyable.

<p>It is five months since the League One side found the net and they could equal EFL’s longest barren run on Tuesday</p><p>The mind can only begin to wonder about the kind of goal celebration Cheltenham Town have planned. Something flamboyant, a touch theatrical? A choreographed team move? Off-the-cuff or calculated? Or maybe the joy will be muted, more Shearer than Sturridge. Perhaps they are ready to unleash a self-deprecating routine when the moment finally arrives? After all, the players at League One’s bottom club have had almost five months to iron out the finer details. They have played more than 1,100 minutes since last scoring a goal.</p><p>The numbers make for grim reading: Cheltenham have scored three own goals but it is more than 18 hours since one of their players scored for them – more than 15 in the league after their failure to find the net in defeat at Lincoln last Saturday made it 10 straight games without a goal. They have more red cards (two) than goals and if Ch

<p>Former Barcelona striker under police investigation for allegedly promising to help a friend’s club gain promotion</p><p>Even before the leak, rumours had been circulating for a while.

<p>With no end to the conflict in sight, politicians and the public must not waver in our resolve to support the wartorn country</p><p>The blue and yellow flag still flies high over Britain’s town squares and public buildings, signalling our unwavering and enduring solidarity with Ukraine’s war effort.</p><p>Well, in theory, anyway. For you can feel the fatigue descending now, like heavy autumn mist pooling in the bottom of a valley; a sort of strange public torpor, quietly smothering the high emotion of the early days of the war. Having leapt too quickly at the assumption that Kyiv couldn’t possibly hold out against the mighty Russian army, British public opinion then swung wildly towards what has turned out to be an equally unrealistic idea, namely that plucky Ukraine could somehow achieve a David v Goliath victory over the rusting superpower within the year. We could put up with one winter of rocketing gas bills, surely, if that was the price to be paid for peace in Europe. Only n

<p>What if James Joyce and his great love had split up at the start? Morrissy’s reimagining is a stylistic tour de force that the man himself would have surely admired</p><p>In Dublin on 10 June 1904, in Nassau Street, James Joyce, aspiring writer and penniless flâneur, accosted a handsome young woman with auburn hair and a self-possessed stride. Her slightly comical name – though Joyce never thought it so – was Norah Barnacle. She had come from Galway the previous year to work as a chambermaid in Finn’s hotel, at the far end of Nassau Street. He asked her for a date, and she accepted. Thus began one of the most famous romantic partnerships in world literature.</p><p>Famous, and extremely unlikely. Joyce was highly educated, perhaps too much so, knew a number of languages including Danish, wrote verse and prose of exquisite sensitivity, and had no doubts as to his own genius. Nora – the “h” was the least of the things Joyce took from her – had left school at 12, was not much interest

<p>Hideaki Anno’s four-part reworking of his philosophical 90s anime classic Neon Genesis Evangelion reaches its conclusion with an emotional father-son confrontation</p><p>As far as grandiose projections of one man’s psyche go, Hideaki Anno’s Neon Genesis Evangelion franchise must be near the top. Not only did he spin this iconic 90s anime series about a messianic mech-fighter blowout from his own clinical depression, but he’s also recently managed to chew over the material a second time, reworking it as a series of four films: the so-called Rebuild of Evangelion. Production on this final one – which roughly retreads the same story material as the highly rated 1997 cinema release End of Evangelion – was apparently slowed by another bout of Anno’s mental illness.</p><p>Part of what was reportedly blocking Anno creatively was that he struggled to identify with the protagonist Shinji Ikari, who has a more hopeful perspective on mankind, and instead feels closer these days to Shinji’s f

If the present leader, Rishi Sunak, loses power next year, the Tories would be wise to pause. For all the hysteria of modern Westminster, Sunak has steered his ship from a tempest into calmer waters with some dignity. But politics rarely forgives defeat. He has been an energetic and intelligent prime minister, and should surely be allowed to recover his party from anything less than a humiliating defeat. But parties tend to reward a challenge from a more extreme wing. Badenoch may well step in.</p><p>Everything in her record suggests she is something of a rarity.
