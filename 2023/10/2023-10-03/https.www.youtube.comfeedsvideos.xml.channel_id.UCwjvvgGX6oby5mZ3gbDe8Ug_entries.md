One speculation is that CCP leader Xi Jinping secretly visited the Lingyin Temple to offer incense. The open gate and red carpet of Lingyin Temple were, in fact, prepared for Xi. On the afternoon of September 22, Xi met with Assad at the West Lake State Guesthouse in Hangzhou, six kilometers away from the Lingyin Temple. Later, people noticed a suspected Tablet of the National Fortune of the People's Republic of China enshrined in the Lingyin Temple. No one knows when this tablet appeared.
