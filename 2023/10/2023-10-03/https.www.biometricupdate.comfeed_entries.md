		CCTV images from shoplifting, burglary and theft investigations in the UK should be compared against Home Office passport and immigration databases with facial recognition, Police Minister Chris Philp says according to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12584717/Shoplifters-beware-Police-start-checking-CCTV-thefts-against-official-government-photo-databases-game-changing-crackdown-crime.html">Daily Mail</a>.

There are no legal restrictions to keep the government data from being used in criminal investigation, Philp said during the Conservative party conference. The College of Policing also said in August that police in England and Wales will be directed to consider all potential evidence to find suspects or stolen property.

		With the rise of digital public infrastructure (DPI) and digital ID infrastructure, the European Union sees an opportunity for a comprehensive migration policy to provide consistent migrant management, according to an <a href="https://publications.iom.int/system/files/pdf/pub2023-075-r-access-to-digital-identity.pdf">IOM report</a> on access to digital identity for migrants in Europe.

The migrant population made up 3.6 percent of the global population in 2020, according to the report. Almost 13 percent of the EU's population for the same year were international migrants. Data from 2018 shows that one billion people in the world did not have a basic proof of legal identity, which is often essential for basic services and for vetting.

		When U.S. state of New York schools got the OK last week to use biometric systems short of facial recognition, the move gave more momentum to policies arming teachers with guns.

One of the first reactions came from the Security Industry Association, which <a href="https://www.securityindustry.org/2023/10/02/new-york-lifts-ban-on-biometric-technologies-in-k-12-schools/">criticized</a> the fact that the state's department of education continued to bar face biometrics collection of any kinds on school grounds.

The board <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202309/facial-recognition-shut-out-of-new-york-state-schools">announced</a> that other biometrics systems can be used by schools so long as boards examine how doing so would affect privacy and civil rights, how effective t

		<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/thales-digital-identity-and-security">Thales</a> is bringing its OneWelcome Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) platform to Terveystalo, Finland’s largest healthcare service provider. In a release, Terveystalo says it hopes the<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/thales-credits-digital-id-with-some-of-its-financial-buoyancy"> digital identity</a> platform will accelerate its digital transformation in order to make access to its services faster and more secure for customers.

Danny de Vreeze, VP of Identity and Access Management products at Thales, says the deal is a natural fit for the French firm, which invests in “deep tech” innovations such as advanced biometrics, AI and quantum comput

		In the next few months, a new generation ID card production facility, which will be as expedient as the country’s <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202108/how-augentic-delivered-cameroons-biometric-passport-project-amid-the-pandemic">passport issuance system</a>, will go operational in Cameroon.

This is according to the Delegate General for National Security (DGSN), Martin Mbarga Nguele, who made the announcement in Douala recently as he commissioned a modern biometric passport production center in the economic capital. The DGSN is the ID-issuing authority.

The announcement by Mbarga Nguele has been greeted with renewed hope among citizens as the issuance of ID cards <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202303/opposition-mps-push-for-parliamentary-debate-on-camer

		A logical idea in the U.S. to get more people enrolled in a trusted digital ID program has become proposed legislation.

The history of biometric identification in the United States has been one of half-measures, programs created by individual states and isolated agency efforts. Whether it is the result of national leaders accepting the technology or its need, the legislation could result in greater digital security for ordinary Americans.

A more <a href="https://www.billtrack50.com/billdetail/1609681">strategic digital ID bill</a>, also introduced this year, would overlie the new legislation, which is more about service delivery.

The company shows a negative EBITDA, but growth reflects in the firm’s success in new strategic markets in the Middle East, including the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, which have implemented Facephi’s SaaS through the fintech firm Qashio.

The launches come months after the National Assembly <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202307/bhutan-adopts-national-identity-bill">adopted a legislation</a> to govern the self-sovereign identity (SSI), which seeks to make access to digital services seamless for citizens of the mountainous South Asian country.

		It is now compulsory for businesses in the industrial sector to use the United Arab Emirates digital national ID, the UAE Pass, to access services offered by the country’s Ministry of Industry and Advanced Technology (MoIAT).

According to a <a href="https://wam.ae/en/details/1395303201347">report</a> from the Emirates News Agency, the UAE Pass will henceforth be required to access services related to industrial standards, conformity assessments as well as for accreditation services.

The UAE Pass can be used by downloading it from Google Play or App Store and registering following three simple steps, which require the user to upload their Emirati ID, ensure their phone number and email are correct, and then set up a password to access the services available on the app.

		A Spanish legal ruling on facial recognition could have ramifications for businesses using biometrics to monitor workers.

According to an article in<a href="https://www.gearrice.com/update/a-spanish-company-forced-to-compensate-an-employee-for-using-facial-recognition-to-monitor-him-irregularly/"> Gearrice</a>, the Social Court No. 2 of Alicante found that Albero Forte Composite SL, a plastics manufacturer also known as Plastic Forte, had violated its workers’ right to privacy in using facial recognition to create a database that could be used to control entry and exit. Employees signed a consent form allowing their images to be used for various purposes, but the document did not cover face biometrics.

		Fifteen years after its passage, the U.S. state of Illinois' Biometric Information Privacy Act only looks more threatening to non-governmental organizations using biometric scans in the state.

<a href="https://www.law360.com/cybersecurity-privacy/articles/1725957">Analysis</a> of BIPA's impact in the trade publication Law360 notes what so many have said before. The courts have largely defined BIPA as a big stick to be used on businesses who are not careful enough with people's biometric data.

The liability law requires non-governmental organizations to get consent before collecting a person's biometric data and disclose how collected data is protected and managed. It has influenced related legislation in other states.
