A new SEC filing revealed that Docket raised $5.35 million. Arjun Pillai, the startup&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, confirmed the funding to GeekWire but declined to share additional details. Foundation Capital General Partner Ashu Garg is listed as a director in the filing. &#8220;I believe AI will heavily augment the future of sales to make it easier on both the seller and buyer sides,&#8221; Pillai told GeekWire. Docket sells an AI platform billed as a &#8220;virtual sales engineer.&#8221; The&#8230; <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2023/entrepreneur-who-sold-last-startup-to-zoominfo-is-raising-cash-for-new-seattle-ai-startup/\">Read More</a>", "link": "https://www.geekwire.com/2023/entrepreneur-who-sold-last-startup-to-zoominfo-is-raising-cash-for-new-seattle-ai-startup/", "date_published": "2023-10-03T21:39:23+00:00", "bookmarked": false, "dead": null, "artist": "GeekWire", "album": "GeekWire", "user": null, "language": "en-US", "thumbnail": "https://www.geekwire.com/wp-content/themes/geekwire/dist/images/geekwire-logo-rss.png"}, {"source": "https://www.geekwire.com/feed/", "title": "Microsoft and Oracle, frenemies at last: What others can learn from their unlikely partnership", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" height=\"667\" src=\"https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/satya-nadella-and-larry-ellison_web.jpg\" width=\"1000\" /><br />&#8220;All partnerships are tactical. There is no such thing as a strategic partnership.&#8221; That&#8217;s one of the lessons that business and technology leader Bob Muglia tells the companies he works with these days. It&#8217;s one of the insights that has stuck with me since my recent interview with Muglia during an event for his book, The Datapreneurs, hosted by Island Books on Mercer Island in the Seattle area. Muglia, the former Snowflake CEO and past Microsoft executive, said this in response to my question about the recently expanded partnership between Microsoft and Oracle.
