The graphical improvements are massive, and the game makes good use of the PS5's additional horsepower to deliver jaw dropping vistas all rendered with striking attention to micro detail. \n\nWe get to see some great use of cutting edge rendering techniques like photogrammetry, which comes together with impressive post processing effects for a presentation that's nothing short of spectacular. While there are some rough edges in certain aspects like sky rendering and shoddy anti-aliasing, by and large - Final Fantasy 16 is a game that doesn't fail to impress.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pduVzktTXY", "date_published": "2023-06-21 16:00:09+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Final Fantasy 16 Review - The Final Verdict", "description": "About seven years since it entered full production, Final Fantasy 16 is here.

However, the average gaming fan will find that the Game Gear offerings in this update are lackluster and better left in the past. \n\nWithout any modernization efforts, these titles were either poorly conceived or didn\u2019t age remarkably well. Still, the four core remastered titles at the center of Sonic Origins Plus are worth the price of admission for this package if you hadn\u2019t previously acquired the Sonic Origins base game. With speedy, platforming action, vibrant pixelated art, and mesmerizing level design, there\u2019s plenty to love with the Anniversary editions of Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Sonic CD.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IscBY00R364", "date_published": "2023-06-21 13:00:17+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
