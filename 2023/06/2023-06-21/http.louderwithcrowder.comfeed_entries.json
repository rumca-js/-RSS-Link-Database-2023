The reality is the bar's so low, showing the slightest bit of nuance or slaughtering the tiniest of leftist sacred veals makes you \"right-wing\" these days. When you hear what Sheridan told <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> about his meeting pitching the show to HBO and what was said to him by a vice president at the network, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/little-mermaid-south-korea\" target=\"_blank\">the crap that winds up on air</a> starts to make sense.</p><blockquote>\"<em>\u2018Look, it just feels so Middle America.

I will bet you a free case of Bud Light (after rebate) this is not the only Vice President at a media company who feels this way.</p><p>Sheridan, to his credit, got the last word by working everything this VP said into the dialogue of an uppity NYC reporter. Then he had Jamie Dutton kill the reporter.</p><p>Years later this now-former VP, possibly forgetting this conversation, emailed Sheridan to congratulate him on <em>Yellowstone's</em> success. AND to pitch Sheridan a new show.</p><blockquote><em>\u201c</em><em>Great idea.

Both have strong ideological beliefs and are the chief executives of states where those beliefs have turned into policies. Florida and California are two IRL examples of what conservative vs progressive governance is. Let the two of them crisscross the country making the case to the rest of America.</p><p>My money is on Florida winning.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

A (soon to be) former recruiter is caught on video bragging about how much they profit off of Ukraine and how little it costs for them to buy a senator. If you've ever viewed Blackrock as Tomax and Xamot managing Cobra Commander's hedge fund, you're gonna LOVE Serge Varlay.</p><p>He's the latest to find himself saying, \"Wait, my date was a reporter for the <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/john-fetterman-special-assisstant\" target=\"_blank\">O'Keefe Media Group</a>?

You can buy one of them for about ten grand.</p><p>It's the Ukraine comments about how much Blackrock makes off of the Ukraine war where you can really appreciate Serge's inner douche.</p><p>\"The Ukrainian economy is tied very largely to the wheat market, global wheat market, prices of bread, you know, literally everything goes up and down. This is fantastic if you\u2019re trading. Volatility creates an opportunity to make a profit. War is real f*cking good for business. [...] it\u2019s exciting when sh*t goes wrong.\"</p><p>What makes those comments fascinating is the day before this video dropped, <a href=\"https://humanevents.com/2023/06/19/blackrock-jp-morgan-set-up-reconstruction-bank-for-ukraine\" target=\"_blank\">Human Events had a story</a> about Blackrock setting up what they call a \"reconstruction bank\" in Ukraine, where they already making some serious cash.</p><blockquote>With the steep cost to rebuild, the Ukrainian government reached out to BlackRock in November to see if there was a conceivable way of attracting investments.<br /> <br />Philipp Hildebrand, BlackRock vice-chair, said: \u201cSo many of today\u2019s long-term challenges are best addressed through blended finance and this is one.

There will be a follow-up video dropping sometime today.</p><p>It's alarming how long Blackrock has been able to operate like this without anyone noticing. I was shocked to hear them named dropped on a 2011 episode of <em>The Office</em> as \"the paragon by which all hedge funds must now be compared.\" Now they are the ones most behind forcing corporations to affirm every radical progressive policy at the expense of the American people.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.
