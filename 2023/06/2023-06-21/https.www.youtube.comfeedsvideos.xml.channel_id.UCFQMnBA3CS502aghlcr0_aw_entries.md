It is finished. Traders Domain is closed for business, having run out of money and unable to pay creditors. 

The owner, Ted Safranko jumps on a call with Coffeezilla to argue that he has no responsibility, and is confronted with paperwork that suggests otherwise. Coffeezilla discovers even more evidence from the Traders Domain backend provider B2Broker including support chats that show fraudulent record keeping, and finally Coffeezilla puts together 9000+ daily account statements in order to map out the scheme. And finally somehow Jordan Belfort the "Wolf of Wall St" makes an appearance.

This video is an opinion and in no way should be construed as statements of fact. Scams, bad business opportunities, and fake gurus are subjective terms that mean different things to different people. I think someone who promises $100K/month for an upfront fee of $2K is a scam. Others would call it a Napoleon Hill pitch.
