Timebeat just launched the TimeCard mini, and you can find out more here: https://store.timebeat.app/collections/timecard-mini

It's expensive, but that's because it includes a *full* PTP time server with GPS and PPS output, including a Raspberry Pi and high-accuracy TXCO timing circuit!

Note: Timebeat did NOT offer any form of compensation for this video, but since they provided the hardware for review, I am checking the 'Paid Promotion' box on the video.

More to come, make sure to follow me and see what I'm bringing to LTX 2023...
