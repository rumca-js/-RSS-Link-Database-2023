  <p id="fEYIGT">A landmark US climate trial over whether the state of Montana is violating young people’s right to a healthy environment came to an early close on Tuesday. Its outcome could shift policy in a state with one of the biggest coal reserves in the nation and might even influence a slew of other suits outside of Montana.</p>
<p id="GKmWZl">The case,<em> Held v. Montana</em>, was filed by a group of 16 youths ranging from five to 22 years old. They say they “have been and will continue to be harmed by the dangerous impacts of fossil fuels and the climate crisis,” according to the <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/571d109b04426270152febe0/t/6210037f5cbf9b34dc9abb84/1645216660046/Held+v+Montana+Complaint.pdf">complaint</a> filed in March 2020. Similar suits have been filed by young people across the US. But last week, the Montana case became the first in the nation to make it to trial.</p>

  <p id="ymp">After more than a year of brutal cancellations and layoffs at HBO, it looks like Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav’s devotion to quick revenue is as strong as ever. Warner Bros. Discovery may be licensing HBO Original Series to Netflix, <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/06/warner-bros-discovery-in-talks-to-license-hbo-original-series-to-netflix-1235421444/"><em>Deadline</em> reported yesterday</a>. <em>Deadline</em>’s sources claim it’s a financial move HBO’s old guard disagreed with but that it’s necessary to shore up the bottom line. They also say it’s possible the deal may not see the light of day.</p>
<p id="dADZhH">The show rumored to be the subject of the agreement is Issa Rae’s <em>Insecure, </em>which lived on HBO for five seasons until it ended in December 2021. Other shows would follow that. The deal wouldn’t be exclusive; WBD would still be able to show the series on its own platform, Max. </p>

Just like the Bing chatbot on Microsoft Edge, Opera’s AI assistant lives within the browser’s sidebar, where you can have it answer questions using real-time information, generate text or code, brainstorm ideas, and more.</p>
<p id="gNJhvq">The built-in chatbot is powered by Opera’s Composer AI engine and connects to OpenAI’s GPT model. To use the tool, you need to sign up for an Opera account if you don’t have one already. Once that’s done, you can click the Aria icon on the left side of the screen to start chatting. While <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/24/23735673/opera-ai-aria-side-panel-edge">Opera first started testing the revamped version of the browser</a> in May, now it’s available to everyone who downloads...</p>

  <p id="NxOGeE">Reddit is cracking down on the latest form of community protest: switching to Not Safe For Work (NSFW). Some subreddits had switched to NSFW to protest Reddit’s recent treatment of moderators and upcoming API pricing changes, but a Reddit admin — that is, an employee — said Wednesday that doing so is “inappropriate” and against the rules.</p>
<p id="TnlQCJ">“Changing a previously SFW community to a NSFW community in order to protest Reddit policies is inappropriate for the members of your community and not acceptable overall,” the admin, ModCodeofConduct, wrote <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/14f75zy/is_transitioning_a_sfw_community_to_nsfw_allowed/joz9ddt/">on Wednesday</a>.

  <p id="eo5xFB">Being able to watch multiple things on TV at the same time is obviously a huge convenience for sports fanatics. So it makes sense that YouTube TV focused <em>exclusively</em> on sports <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/14/23638949/youtube-tv-multiview-early-access">when launching its multiview feature</a>. It’s been several months since then, and today, the company says it’s (slowly) expanding multiview to also feature news, business, and weather programming. That’s the good news.</p>
<p id="GVoWZe">The bad news is that for now, one frustrating catch remains: you’re limited to the preselected multiview groupings that YouTube TV chooses itself and can’t yet customize any of this yourself. </p>

  <p id="4MfnAt">The other day, I was going through a bag full of old tech — I mean, <em>really</em> old tech — trying to convince myself to finally get rid of phones that I hadn’t used for 10 years or so when I came across a battery. One of the batteries that I used to carry around in case my phone ran out of juice.</p>
<p id="VSeegx">You see, once upon a time, smartphones had replaceable batteries. Instead of having to carry around a portable charger or search desperately for a wall socket so you could charge up your failing phone (assuming you had a power cord with you), you could pull off the back of your phone, replace the out-of-power battery with a fully charged one, and proceed happily on your way.</p>

  <p id="H5KCP1">Nintendo is releasing a new <em>WarioWare</em> game for Switch, and the gimmick for this one is moving. In <em>WarioWare: Move It!</em>, you’ll move and shake your way through more than 200 microgames while holding onto Joy-Con controllers.</p>
<p id="XFnjOn">Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4kkqicAeG0">trailer for the game</a> showed off a whole bunch of silly microgames, which will force you to do things like shake paws with a dog, ski down a mountain, flail your arms in the air, and even slide down a slide you might be familiar with if you’ve played <em>Super Mario 64</em>. The game isn’t just a solo endeavor: you’ll also be able to play local co-op with a friend for what’s sure to be some very silly shenanigans, or you can play special minigames in a party mode with up to three other people.</p>

  <p id="1rnqgH">Mario’s big year continues. Following the debut of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23608700/super-nintendo-world-entertainment-miyamoto-takahashi-interview">a theme park</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23669598/super-mario-bros-movie-review">an animated movie</a>, 2023 will also be getting the next <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> game. It’s called <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> and is a return to the 2D side-scrolling action of the original games and the <em>New Super Mario Bros. </em>series. It has some weird new abilities, including the ability to turn into an elephant. It launches on October 20th.</p>
<p id="Y92Xa4">The last mainline <em>Super Mario</em> game was <em>Odyssey</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16552118/super-mario-odyssey-review-nintendo-switch">which hit the Switch back in 2017</a>.

  <p id="nngxw3">Nintendo is remaking one of the most beloved RPGs of all time: <em>Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars. </em>The new version of the game for Nintendo Switch, titled only <em>Super Mario RPG</em>, was revealed during the June Nintendo Direct presentation on Wednesday.</p>
<p id="2cYpQc"><em>Super Mario RPG</em> looks like a faithful reimagining of the original, though with a modern art style. I saw a bunch of iconic characters and moments from the Super NES classic: Mallow and Geno are back, for example, as are baddies like Birdo and Booster (!). It appears the battle system will be largely similar as well. And the game’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r5PJx7rlds">reveal trailer</a> was filled with remixes of songs from the original game. To my ears, they were awesome adaptations of the tracks from <em>Legend of the Seven...</em></p>

  <p id="kIdKj2">The Federal Trade Commission is suing Amazon for enrolling customers in its Prime program without their consent and making it difficult for them to cancel their subscriptions.</p>
<p id="EgZPLc">In its complaint filed Wednesday, the FTC accuses Amazon of “knowingly” deceiving millions of customers into subscribing to Amazon Prime through the use of “dark patterns.” Specifically, the FTC describes how Amazon’s checkout process would allegedly present customers several options to subscribe to Prime, making it difficult to locate the option to simply finish a purchase. The commission also alleges that Amazon required customers to go through multiple unnecessary steps before successfully unsubscribing from the program.</p>

  <p id="fmDPDt">Nintendo is holding <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/20/23766999/nintendo-direct-june-2023-date-stream">its second Direct showcase event of the year</a>, and it sounds like it’ll be a big one. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/8/23591422/nintendo-direct-february-2023-news-trailers">Back in February</a>, the company showed off <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, released a remastered <em>Metroid Prime</em>, added Game Boy games to Switch Online, and gave us a release date for <em>Pikmin 4</em>. This time around, the focus will be on Switch games coming out through the rest of 2023.</p>
<p id="BpUIt7">That includes the next <em>Pikmin</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/8/23591725/pikmin-4-release-date-nintendo-direct-2023">which launches in July</a>, but it’s also likely we’ll see what big game or games Nintendo has in store for the always-important holiday season. Right now, the only major release on the calendar is the first expansion for <em>Pokémon Violet</em> and <em>Scarlet</em>,  <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23616694/pokemon-violet-and-scarlet-dlc-expansion-trailer-nintendo-switch">which is due out in the fall</a>. The Nintendo Direct showcase is expected to last around 40...</p>

  <p id="aG3xNX">I woke up at 7AM yesterday and discovered that two of my Nest cameras were showing as offline. After hours of troubleshooting and hard resetting the cameras to get them working again, I realized the problem was a peculiar issue on Google’s end. Hundreds of Nest Cam owners have reported their cameras showing as offline over the past week or so, but Google hasn’t notified owners or even posted the issue on its <a href="https://status.nest.com/history">Nest service status page</a>.</p>
<p id="DyesLJ">Reddit users in the UK started reporting Nest Cam outages yesterday with similar reports on <a href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Cameras-and-Doorbells/Offline-since-24-hours/td-p/437856">Google’s own support forums</a>. Twitter is <a href="https://twitter.com/carl_moffat/status/1670889044694167561">littered with complaints</a> about offline Nest Cams. <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/06/20/google-nest-camera-offline-bug/"><em>9to5Google </em>even reported</a> on the issues earlier this month, but over the past day the problem has affected a lot more Nest Cam...</p>

  <p id="tnbRtx">Spotify has officially announced a redesign for its desktop app that aims to offer easier access to details on the song or podcast you’re currently listening to, and give you new ways to organize your playlists and other content. According to a <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-06-20/spotify-desktop-experience-redesign-your-library-now-playing-views-customize/">blog post published yesterday</a> the changes — which Spotify calls “one of its biggest revamps yet” — are rolling out to “all Desktop users worldwide” from this week.</p>
<p id="Oe9qrD">The biggest change you’re likely to notice after the update is the Your Library sidebar on the left of the screen. Rather than showing a simple text list of playlists, the interface now includes colorful icons. It also shows recently played artists and albums to quickly jump back into, alongside playlists. You can minimize the sidebar...</p>

  <p id="bFd9kU">It’s that time of year again. Amazon <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/2023/6/prime-day-is-back-this-july-11-12-with-big-savings-new-amazon-exclusive-deals-and-celebrity-product-launches">once again announced</a> its annual sales event for Prime members. Amazon Prime Day officially kicks off at 3AM ET / 12AM PT on Tuesday, July 11th, and runs through Wednesday, July 12th. </p>
<p id="g8smIy">If you can’t wait until the Black Friday / Cyber Monday holiday shopping season, Prime Day offers some of the best deals you can get on a range of goods. That’s assuming, of course, Amazon won’t surprise us again with another “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/23387398/amazon-prime-early-access-sale-2022-deals-news-date-time-retailer">Prime Early Access Sale</a>” (aka, Prime Day 2.0) as it did in early fall last year. </p>

  <p id="pdqflM">Discord plans to give creators a new way to make money from their communities by selling digital products via one-time purchases. These new “Downloadables” can be things like a recipe ebook, a gaming guide, or a digital wallpaper, and the company plans to begin experimenting with them “over the coming months,” Discord’s Derek Yang <a href="https://discord.com/blog/server-subscriptions-updates-media-channels-tier-templates-and-more">wrote in a Tuesday blog post</a>. Downloadables will be available to purchase from a Server Shop, which is also in testing.</p>
<p id="vPXAlf">The new Downloadables and Server Shop add to Discord’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/1/23488381/discord-server-subscriptions-program-monetization">server subscriptions</a> as ways for creators to monetize their servers. Server subscriptions are getting an improvement, too: the company is adding tier templates to make it easier to decide what subscriptions to offer to your community....</p>

  <p id="rrBCqV">Reddit has started removing moderator teams managing subreddits that switched the labeling on their communities to Not Safe For Work (NSFW) in the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/8/23754780/reddit-api-updates-changes-news-announcements">latest protests against the site</a>. In addition to applying an age gate for desktop viewers and restricting access on mobile devices to logged-in users in the Reddit app, Reddit also doesn’t show ads on subreddits tagged NSFW. This cuts into its ability to monetize them, which is a major part of Reddit’s disputed push to charge apps for using the API. </p>
