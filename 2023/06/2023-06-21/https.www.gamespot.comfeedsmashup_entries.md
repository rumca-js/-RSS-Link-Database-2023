Pascal's comments to <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/awards/pedro-pascal-last-of-us-mandalorian-gladiator-2-1235650184/">Variety</a> shed light on the importance of representation and breaking racial stereotypes in the entertainment industry.</p><p dir="ltr">During the interview, Pascal discussed the significance of blind casting and the need to cast actors based on their talent and suitability for a role rather than limiting characters to specific racial identities.

The agency accused Amazon of deceiving customers into signing up for Prime. The complaint claimed that the company made it difficult to buy items without subscribing to Prime. Allegedly, customers were sometimes presented with buttons to close transactions that did not clearly state they would also be enrolled in Prime.</p><p>The FTC has said that the public version of the complaint has been significantly redacted, however it also claimed that the agency has "a number of allegations" which confirm the legitimacy of the lawsuit. FTC Chair Lina Khan said in a prepared statement, "Amazon tricked and trapped people into recurring subscriptions without their consent, not only frustrating users but also costing them significant money. These manipulative tactics harm consumers and law-abiding businesses alike."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lawsuit-accuses-amazon-of-decieving-customers-into-buying-prime/1100-6515397/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">It's been a years-long quest of mine to find good alien abduction horror games. There are strangely few, and I've never really understood why. There are, after all, roughly a few dozen Lovecraftian horror games and as many or more Resident Evil-inspired experiences newly lurking each and every year in the deep recesses of Steam. And yet, whenever extraterrestrials are involved in games, it's usually the case where we're killing them with futuristic weaponry in action-oriented games like Halo, Mass Effect, or Resistance.</p><p dir="ltr">Even when they are the main antagonists in a horror game, like Dead Space, we're usually equipped well enough to fight back, turning them into gameplay obstacles. These games can be fun, but they leave me wanting. For a long time, I've sought a good horror game where we behave as ants do to humans: completely incapable of understanding their intentions and powerless to stop them.</p><p dir="ltr">On itch.io, one such game is going viral, and for very good reason. <a href="https://toothandclaw.itch.io/incident-at-grove-lake">Incident at Grove Lake</a> is an equally terrorizing and mesmerizing microgame built around the unshakeable worry that, in the far reaches of the cosmos, there may be horrors we can't possibly comprehend.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-alien-abduction-horror-game-is-going-viral-for-good-reason/1100-6515388/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Microsoft will be increasing the price of its Xbox Series X consoles and Game Pass subscription service across the world. While the console price will remain the same in the US, Japan, Chile, Brazil, and Colombia, in the rest of the world, the new pricing will see it match the PS5 and its recent global price hike.</p><p>"We've held on our prices for consoles for many years and have adjusted the prices to reflect the competitive conditions in each market," said Kari Perez, head of communications for Xbox, to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/21/23768400/microsoft-xbox-series-x-xbox-game-pass-price-increase">The Verge</a>. The new pricing will set the MSRP of the Xbox Series X to £480 in the UK, €550 in several European markets, CAD $650 in Canada, and AUD $800 in Australia as of August 1. As for the Xbox Series S, its price won't be increased and will remain the same in all markets where it's sold.</p><p>Xbox Game Pass and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, on the other hand, is getting a global price increase from July 6. In the US, it'll increase from $15 a month for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate to $17, and the base Xbox Game Pass subscription will go up from $10 to $11. PC Game Pass pricing will remain the same, and if you're an existing Game Pass monthly subscriber, these new changes will only take effect from August 13, or September 13 if you live in Germany.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-x-consoles-and-xbox-game-pass-subscriptions-are-getting-a-price-increase/1100-6515385/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>While Square Enix is focusing much of its efforts on Final Fantasy 16, it did have some recent news for Dragon Quest fans. The Pokemon-influenced side series is getting a Switch-exclusive comeback in the form of Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince.</p><p>At the latest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-june-2023-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-4782/">Nintendo Direct</a>, Square Enix debuted a trailer for Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince. The titular dark prince is thrown into a world of monsters, but also cursed to be unable to attack them. Saved by a monster-raising mentor, he must become a monster wrangler to survive.</p><p>In play, you can scout, capture, and train various monsters that roam the world. You can combine monsters to create new, more powerful ones. The game looks to have an open-world feel, somewhat like the more recent Switch Pokemon entries. You can also test your wits and skills against monsters in a coliseum. The trailer concludes with a glimpse of Hero from Dragon Quest IV, so the game might take place in the same universe as Chapters of the Chosen.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-quest-monsters-the-dark-prince-brings-more-creature-catching-to-switch-in-december/1100-6515384/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning Part One cast and crew filmed the movie's most dangerous stunt on the very first day of production. The reason? If star Tom Cruise was injured or died performing the stunt, the production could halt or shift gears without costing absurd amounts of money.</p><p>In the stunt in question, Cruise rides a motorcycle off a cliff and then base jumps from the air to safety. In an interview with <a href="https://www.etonline.com/media/videos/tom-cruise-on-performing-the-most-dangerous-stunt-of-his-career-in-mission-impossible">Entertainment Tonight</a> (via <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/tom-cruise-mission-impossible-7-motorcycle-stunt-day-one-filming-1235649298/">Variety</a>), Cruise explained the logic of doing the stunt the very first day of production. "Well we know either we will continue with the film or we’re not. Let’s know day one!" he said, “Let us know day one what is going to happen: Do we all continue or is it a major rewrite?”</p><p>He elaborated that he didn't want to distract from such dangerous stunt with any of the other work of filming. He added, "I was training and I was ready. You have to be razor sharp when you’re doing something like that. It was very important as we were prepping the film that it was actually the first thing. I don’t want to drop that and go shoot other things and have my mind somewhere else. Everyone was prepped. Let’s just get it done."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tom-cruise-performed-mission-impossible-7s-biggest-stunt-on-the-first-day-of-production/1100-6515378/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>EA Tiburon has revealed a lengthy deep dive into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/madden-nfl-24/">Madden 24</a>'s on-field changes players can expect to find when the game arrives this August. Though you can read about most of those in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/for-madden-24-ea-tiburon-has-added-or-adjusted-more-than-1700-tackling-animations/1100-6515346/">a separate article</a>, we'd be remiss not to mention one of the big takeaways from the team's newest blog post: Everyone hates the Mahome dive pass, and EA Tiburon knows it.</p><p>Carving out a section of the lengthy blog, the team addressed the dive pass, first seen in the trailer, which is meant to replicate a circus-like pass Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes actually attempted in Super Bowl 55 back in 2021. In real life, the pass fell incomplete, but the Madden team likes to bring famous moments like this to the game (see OBJ's star-is-born 2015 grab or the Tyree helmet catch from the 2007 Super Bowl for other examples), so this year, it's decided to bring Mahomes' acrobatic throw to the game.</p><figure style="width: 1198px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4155243-screenshot2023-06-20135722.png"><img alt="Some players have joked (or threatened?) to uninstall the game once an opposing QB pulls one of these off." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4155243-screenshot2023-06-20135722.png" /></a><figcaption>Some players have joked (or threatened?) to uninstall the game once an opposing QB pulls one of these off.</figcaption></figure><p>The only problem is nobody seems to like it. Though players are instructed not to share impressions, images, or videos from the ongoing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-24-beta-how-sign-ups-and-codes-work-whats-included-and-more/1100-6514959/">Madden 24 beta</a>, it hasn't stopped a number of them from taking to social media to rant about the throw. Some don't like the animation <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@bad.vibes.4ever/video/7242495895701327147?_op=1&amp;_r=1&amp;_t=8d1ikAlv8J8">applying to other QBs</a> or its <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Madden/comments/146b1d3/cant_wait_part_2/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_term=1">lack of accuracy drop-off</a> when attempted, while others are just out to determine <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT819gL82/">how to activate it</a> in the first place.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-has-addressed-madden-24-mahomes-dive-pass-that-everyone-hates/1100-6515349/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The Josh Allen-starring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/madden-nfl-24/">Madden NFL 24</a> was recently revealed by EA, but the studio only revealed the broad strokes regarding what players can expect for changes. In a new blog post, EA Tiburon is sharing a lot more about what players will see and experience on the field in Madden 24. Note that today's news doesn't discuss things like the return of Superstar mode or the new additions to Franchise, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-nfl-24-release-date-beta-franchise-superstar-mode-whats-new/1100-6514873/">though we've gone over those previously, if you're curious</a>. This is purely about on-field AI, gameplay, and Xs and Os.</p><p>Though the game was plagued by save data issues that persisted for months post-launch, the on-field changes to last year's game have largely been welcomed by the community, and EA Tiburon says it's building on that new foundation with Madden 24. Fieldsense, the overarching term for the core gameplay overhaul, is said to benefit from improved AI "especially in opposing QBs, run blocking, and pass coverage," while improved catch animations are meant to allow receivers to catch balls in stride, bringing more fluidity to the passing game. If done well, it should allow burners like Tyreek Hill a chance to better separate from defenders.</p><p>Tackling has also received a sizeable suite of changes. The game's conservative tackle is gone in Madden 24, replaced with the wrap tackle, with outcomes based on what the team calls the "Tackle Advantage Algorithm." Like the tackling improvements added last year, this sounds like further animation branching technology, in this case allowing smaller defenders to take bigger ball carriers out at the legs. There's also the "Big Man Wrap" (unrelated to my preferred restaurant order) which will see bigger defenders, such as Vita Vea, driving the ball carrier backward.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/for-madden-24-ea-tiburon-has-added-or-adjusted-more-than-1700-tackling-animations/1100-6515346/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Wonder</a>. And while the new Mario game looks lovely, it ended with a showstopper: Elephant Mario. We have seen approximately 1.5 seconds of Elephant Mario and we are ready to die for him.</p><p>Now to be clear, Mario has donned animal-themed suits lots of time in the past. Raccoons, frogs, penguins, even kitty-cats as immortalized in the recent Super Mario Bros. Movie. But all of those suits are just that: suits. They uniformly look like Mario putting on a pair of footie pajamas.</p><p>Elephant Mario is different. This isn't Mario in an elephant suit. This is Mario <em>as an elephant</em>. Like an elephant happened to find 10XL-size overalls and grew out a beautiful mustache. Just look at this thicc king.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/everyone-loves-elephant-mario-thicc-king/1100-6515373/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>During the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-june-2023-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-4782/">June Nintendo Direct</a>, Mario was back in the spotlight with a new 2D adventure game. Super Mario Wonder looks similar in style to the New Super Mario Bros. series, but upgraded with tons of new visual flourishes, enemies, and power-ups. The Nintendo Direct also announced that it's releasing this year, on October 20. Based on early retail listings it appears to be $60.</p><p>While the art style was somewhat similar to NSMB, Mario has noticeably different animations for elements like jumping and running, and even little touches like grabbing his hat after it falls off when going through a pipe. The trailer also showed new power-ups, like one that turned Mario into an elephant, and gameplay elements that played with foreground and background layers.</p><p>In an announcement following the presentation, Nintendo explained that the adventure kicks off when Mario touches a "Wonder Flower." That unlocks various wonders of the world that change gameplay in unique ways, like making pipes come alive or summoning hordes of enemies. Mario, Luigi, Toad, Princess Peach, Princess Daisy, and Yoshi are all playable characters, and the game features four-player co-op.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-bros-wonder-a-new-2d-mario-is-releasing-in-october/1100-6515326/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>In the past year, AI has become a controversial topic when coming into the artistic landscape. Programs and services like Midjourney have already been used for political cartoons and book cover designs, but now Marvel has used AI to create the intro for its new Secret Invasion series on Disney+.</p><p>The intro hits hard with its theme of shape-shifting people, going back and forth from Skrull to human, in a barrage of dark and light greens. It's full of weird and alien shapes, and while it might be too on the nose with something to say about trying to be human, but that is specifically the intent.</p><p>"We would talk to them about ideas and themes and words, and then the computer would go off and do something," Secret Invasion director Ali Selim told <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23767640/ai-mcu-secret-invasion-opening-credits">Polygon</a>. "And then we could change it a little bit by using words, and it would change."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-marvels-secret-invasion-has-an-ai-made-opening/1100-6515375/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Upon first impression, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-xvi/">Final Fantasy XVI</a> struck me with its darker and more violent tone than anything in the series' past. It's not just in the graphic depictions of bloody battles or godlike beings crushing each other to a pulp, but also in the explicit narrative threads about persecution and enslavement. It delves into the death and destruction that follows in the wake of all the political drama and supernatural standoffs. The brutality inflicted upon its victims is laid bare at nearly every turn, sometimes to the point of embellishment, to strike the nerves it wants to hit. But there's a thematic coherence to it all that melds what happens to the people at the ground level with the fantastical elements that steer their destinies. And within that harsh exterior, glossed with magic and aether, is a gripping story about characters clinging to their humanity, the bonds that give them strength, and the lengths they'll go to make the world a better place--all told in a way that only Final Fantasy can.</p><p dir="ltr">Final Fantasy has always been about reinvention and FFXVI perhaps marks the series' most drastic shift yet. The combat system veers much closer to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/devil-may-cry-5/">Devil May Cry</a> than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-xv/">Final Fantasy XV</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake/">VII Remake</a>, and is a shining example of what an action-RPG can be. Eikon battles initially seem to be just explosive set-pieces but grow into meaningful moments that are as narratively driven as they are utterly impressive spectacles. Through the awe-inspiring battles and emotional cutscenes, I found myself repeatedly asking in disbelief, "Did this game just do this?" as the soundtrack's beautiful melodies were seared into my memory. However, those peaks are also met with dated design conventions that stick out like sore thumbs, making for some noticeable lulls in the 50-plus hours I spent with the game. Still, I’ll always remember FFXVI for its powerful and stunning moments, for those are the reasons it stands among the storied franchise's best.</p><p>FFXVI is very much about the growth of Clive and the people around him, but story's initial emphasis on the nations and political structures of Valisthea set the stage for everything that follows. Valisthea is a world plagued by environmental decay and war is fueled by the hunger for resources, which in this case, are the crystals. Because they are a catch-all magical resource, those with the inherent ability to wield magic are abused, subjugated, and treated as property; tools to be used and sacrificed in service of their supposed superiors. Thus, liberation and revolution are the narrative throughlines, and FFXVI heavily leans into these themes, using them as a strong foundation to build every facet of the story and its characters.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-16-review-on-its-own-terms/1900-6418081/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The recently released demo for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lies-of-p/">Lies of P</a> has earned plenty of praise from players who have enjoyed its meaty combat systems, but one aspect of the game that has drawn criticism is its dodge move. In response to feedback of this crucial gameplay mechanic, game director Jiwon Choi says that changes will be made to the dodge ability before the Pinocchio Souls-like launches in September.</p><p>"In Lies of P, dodging and guarding are one of the most crucial elements, alongside the P-Organ," Choi explained. "Given the inherent intricacies of the game's structure, it is imperative to handle these elements meticulously with great care. We are currently undergoing a comprehensive evaluation on the various aspects of the dodging system, including the invincibility frames, distance mechanics, and more. Our team of developers is fully committed to delivering an exceptional combat experience that not only maintains the essence of enjoyment but also reflects the precise attention to detail required."</p><div>          </div><p> </p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lies-of-p-dodge-ability-is-getting-a-comprehensive-fix-before-launch/1100-6515362/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Square Enix says it's open to making a first-person Final Fantasy game in the style of Call of Duty. Final Fantasy is known for its wide range of genres and mechanics, such as traditional turn-based combat and even real-time action across its many games, but Square Enix is evidently open to evolving the series further.</p><p>This comes by way of a recent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-20/-final-fantasy-xvi-reinvents-the-franchise-for-the-ps5?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTY4NzI5NDgzNywiZXhwIjoxNjg3ODk5NjM3LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJSV0tMMDNEV0xVNjgwMSIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.9OLcHlX_bvakwSOS7H-Fx97pn82433i1FR--0B-HdT8">Bloomberg</a> interview with Square Enix Vice President Yoshinori Kitase, who discussed how Final Fantasy has evolved over the years.

When asked if the series could ditch its RPG systems in favor of a first-person military shooter, Kitase said he'd be open to making a Final Fantasy game similar to Call of Duty.</p><p>Of course, this was just a hypothetical comment, but the series has ventured into shooter territory before. One such game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dirge-of-cerberus-final-fantasy-vii/">Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII</a>, a third-person shooter released for the PS2 in 2006.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/even-a-cod-style-shooter-isnt-off-the-table-for-final-fantasy/1100-6515361/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Square Enix's cutesy Final Fantasy-themed racer, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/chocobo-gp/">Chocobo GP</a>, has had a surprise resurrection this week, with the game re-releasing on Switch with no trace of microtransactions.</p><p>The game had a rocky launch due to controversy over aggressive monetizations and grindy battle passes, which led to Square Enix discontinuing its main in-game currency, Mythril, and releasing its last major content update just nine months after launch. <a href="https://support.eu.square-enix.com/news.php?id=19033&amp;la=2&amp;n=2&amp;drt=1671580800&amp;tag=65e7349908a2c24616f2d668a26f11e3cc3f7dd5">The update</a> stated that after Season 5, released on December 21, 2022, there would be no further updates to add new maps or characters, and no more battle passes. Sales of Mythril were stopped, with the currency removed from the game altogether on January 6, 2023.</p><p>Now, the release date on Chocobo GP's Switch eShop listing has been updated to June 15, 2023, offering a full, microtransaction-free version of the game.

## You Can Finish The Fortnite Battle Pass Faster Than Ever With This Creative Mode Trick

<p><span>If you're desperate to get your hands on Optimus Prime and aren't happy about the speed with which you're moving through Fortnite's Chapter 4 Season 3 battle pass, it may just be time for you to try something other than Battle Royale to get your XP fix. And no, I'm not talking about Save the World. I'm talking about Creative.</span></p><p dir="ltr">Before you scoff, listen to this: In all, you can earn around 10 levels per day grinding XP in Creative right now, if you know what to do, all thanks to some changes the mode has undergone recently. It won't necessarily happen quickly, but if you're out of quests to do in Battle Royale, or if you just don't want that stress, you should find some Creative maps to try--you should be able to easily level faster in Creative mode than in Battle Royale.</p><p dir="ltr">So here's the deal. Two very important things happened for Creative mode last season: Epic increased the daily XP cap to about five battle pass levels' worth of XP, and it introduced the Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN). Before the studio settled on this new cap, the amount of XP you could get from Creative each day was all over the place--some days you could pull 3 or 4 levels, and others just 1 or 2. It likely depended on how much time you were spending in Creative overall--the more XP you got from Creative, the more the game may have been throttling it over time. But now it seems to pretty consistently allow you to get this set amount of XP each day, regardless of how often you play.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-finish-the-fortnite-battle-pass-faster-than-ever-with-this-creative-mode-trick/1100-6515355/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Season 4 of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20/">Call of Duty: Warzone 2</a> includes the brand-new Vondel map for battle royale and DMZ. This medium-size map includes 15 main points of interest, but there's also a secret townhouse filled with loot, and we'll guide you bypassing Vondel's "stuck door," and help you get geared up with some high-tier loot.</p><p dir="ltr">During your adventures on Vondel you might've noticed a townhouse with a stuck door. It looks like any other door that you should be able to enter, but running up to this specific door gives you text that reveals the door is stuck. There's also a prompt to interact with the door but nothing happens, and that's because you'll need to find the secret entrance.</p><p dir="ltr">This building (as marked on the screenshot below) is located in the section of townhouses just west of Vondel's Police Station.
