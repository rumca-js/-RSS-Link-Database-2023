[{"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "The Change review \u2013 Bridget Christie\u2019s super-cool menopause comedy is like nothing else on TV", "description": "<p>She decides to take back 3.5 million minutes of domestic drudgery, jump on a motorcycle and set off on a voyage of self discovery. Hot flushes have never looked hotter! </p><p>Did no one think to cast standup Bridget Christie in the upcoming Barbie movie? If it\u2019s true, as Christie asserts, that \u201cThe Hulk is the only menopausal role model in the history of TV and film\u201d, then having Christie play Menopausal Barbie alongside Issa Rae as President Barbie and Nicola Coughlan as Diplomat Barbie in Greta Gerwig\u2019s panorama of modern womanhood might have helped. As it is, she\u2019s had to do it all herself. As usual. Christie writes and stars in The Change \u2013 her sitcom debut \u2013 as Linda, a much put-upon wife, mother and retail worker who reaches a crisis point at her 50th birthday party.</p><p>It\u2019s not just the menopause. It\u2019s also the cluelessness of her husband (Omid Djalili), the open disdain of her teenage children and society\u2019s general denial of the full humanity of older women that pushes Linda over the edge. She determines to take back some of those 3.5 million minutes of domestic drudgery (she\u2019s been keeping careful record) and heads off on an adventure of self-discovery. She looks pretty cool doing it too, astride her Triumph motorcycle, amid the mystical ancient woodlands of the Forest of Dean, in search of a time capsule she hid there as a 10-year-old. Thus, by the first commercial break of the first episode, The Change has already succeeded in its primary goal: Linda is the role model we\u2019ve all been waiting for. Hot flushes never looked hotter.</p><p>The Change is on Channel 4.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/21/the-change-review-bridget-christies-super-cool-menopause-comedy-is-like-nothing-else-on-tv\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/21/the-change-review-bridget-christies-super-cool-menopause-comedy-is-like-nothing-else-on-tv", "date_published": "2023-06-21 21:35:50+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "Pentagon leaks suspect Jack Teixeira pleads not guilty to six charges", "description": "<p>Air national guard member, 21, enters pleas in Massachusetts federal court days after being indicted by grand jury</p><p>Jack Teixeira, the Massachusetts air national guard member accused of leaking highly classified military documents on a social media platform, pleaded not guilty on Wednesday to federal felony charges.</p><p>Teixeira, 21, entered the pleas during a hearing in Worcester\u2019s federal court days after he was indicted by a grand jury on six counts of willful retention and transmission of national defense information.
