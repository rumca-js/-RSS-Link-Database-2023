## Xbox Raises Prices for Series X, Game Pass - IGN Daily Fix

In today's Daily Fix:
Microsoft has decided to raise the price of the Xbox Series X in select markets, and is raising the price of its Game Pass service in all markets. Gamers living in select European countries, the U.K., Canada, and Australia can expect to pay a little more for brand-new Xbox Series X consoles, while the U.S. is (so far) spared from the hike. Monthly Game Pass Ultimate subs are going up by about $2 in the U.S., and comparable increases every where else. PC Game Pass, however, is staying the same price. In Nintendo news, the Big N just had their latest Nintendo Direct, showcasing a new 2D Super Mario Bros. game, a remake of the classic SNES title Super Mario RPG, a new Princess Peach game, and a few more. Most of these games are scheduled for release this year, and it feels like, in a post-Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom world, this is the congratulatory victory lap the Nintendo Switch needs to close out this generation. Nintendo does have one more major event this year, so maybe we'll hear something—anything—about their next major console.

There’s no shortage of new PlayStation games on the way, but now that the dust has settled on Sony’s summer showcase and the other big publishers have shown their hands, we’re feeling a little let down. Spider-Man 2 looks amazing, but we expected as much - it was a little weird that the release date got saved for Summer Game Fest. Naughty Dog’s big announcement is that The Last of Us multiplayer is a ways off. Bungie’s first new IP under Sony, Marathon, is a cross-platform multiplayer game, despite the original Marathon’s single-player campaign being beloved by longtime fans. PSVR 2 is getting some new games, but why isn’t Sony making any of them? And don’t even get us started on Project Q, a handheld seemingly designed for no one. But ultimately, PlayStation 5 is selling amazingly, so maybe Sony’s strategy is working?

With Starfield being the center of the Xbox 2023 Showcase last week, Bethesda gave us a deep dive into one of the biggest games this generation.
