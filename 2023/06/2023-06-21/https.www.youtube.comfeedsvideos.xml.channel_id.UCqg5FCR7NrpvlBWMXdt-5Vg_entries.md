This week on Breakout, we discuss today's Nintendo Direct showcase which signaled the Switch still has some life left in it before the inevitable follow-up console.

Featuring Nick Calandra, Marty Sliva, and KC Nwosu, the freeform podcast dives into a bit of our daily lives, the latest games, movies, tv shows and books, the occasional craft beer review and random topics we find interesting.
