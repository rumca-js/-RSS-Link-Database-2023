<p>Starmer and his party seem to have concluded direct support for homeowners cannot be justified – but it’s smart politics to be seen to take on the banks</p><p>Labour’s “five-point plan” to ease the pain in the mortgage market can be boiled down to a single idea: get heavy with the lenders – the banks and building societies – to make them play nicely with over-stretched borrowers.</p><p>One cannot call it a radical idea, however. First, it’s in the interests of lenders themselves, up to a point, to be flexible by, say, lengthening the term of the loan, granting a payment holiday or allowing a borrower to switch to interest-only arrangements for a while. Second, many banks say they already have such policies in place, even if critics say they’re not advertising them with enthusiasm.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/jun/21/lets-not-pretend-labour-has-found-a-way-to-defuse-the-mortgage-timebomb">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This taboo-breaking comedy about parenting a child with disabilities is back for a one-off special with an air of finality. It’s sad, funny, lovely and tearjerking all at once</p><p></p><p>When I first became a parent, a friend cut through all the cooing and celebration and asked a clever question: what was the scariest thing about it? It took me a minute to find the answer: you can’t undo it. You can never undo it. Mortgages and marriages and other things that seem permanent are, in fact, easily dismantled, but once you are a kid’s parent, that’s it. It’s a life sentence.</p><p>Most parents don’t want to be freed, because they love their child so completely that returning to a world without them feels absurd. There She Goes, however, is a comedy about people who have longed for a reset button. Emily (Jessica Hynes) and Simon (David Tennant) have a learning-disabled daughter, Rosie (Miley Locke), who is non-verbal and exhibits extremely challenging behaviour due to a chromosomal disorder. Every day is a nightmare of torn books, smashed possessions, smeared food and scratched skin, to a soundtrack of grinding screeches where the girl’s words should be. With the regular joys of parenting out of reach, the show and its characters have had to fight to find their own.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/21/there-she-goes-review-a-beautiful-cathartic-return-for-david-tennant-and-jessica-hynes">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In a new documentary, two trans film-makers aim to shed light on a community often stereotyped and undervalued</p><p>For trans film-maker Kristen Lovell, her new documentary The Stroll – co-directed with another trans film-maker, Zackary Drucker, and premiering on HBO this week – was about including an ignored chapter of trans history, one that she herself lived. Young, Black, and trans in 90s New York, Lovell was fired from her job when she began to live her truth and was forced to sustain herself via sex work. The Stroll is a testament to what she went through just to be herself and the stories of so many other women like her that she met along the way.</p><p>“It was just time to tell this story,” Lovell told me. “There was a void, a generational void, where we went from the likes of Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P Johnson to this new generation that’s coming up and fighting again for trans rights, and there’s a generational gap. Trans history is something that’s not taught in schools, so the new generation really didn’t have an understanding of all this stuff.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/21/stroll-documentary-trans-sex-workers-new-york-city-hbo">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The speaker had to step in after the PM’s claims about the economy stretched the credulity of at least one MP at PMQ</p><p>It was just after Rishi Sunak had answered Stephen Flynn’s first question that the speaker intervened. The SNP leader in Westminster had merely wondered if some of the prime minister’s promises to fix the economy showed that he had been taking honesty lessons from Boris Johnson. This was too much for Lindsay Hoyle. He urged MPs to be more cautious in their use of language. There was a danger that people might think Flynn was accusing the prime minister of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/15/partygate-report-published-boris-johnson-misled-parliament">deliberately misleading parliament</a>.</p><p>So there we had it. A new precedent. No one can now compare another MP to Boris Johnson, because to do so is to accuse them of lying. Spare a thought for Jacob Rees-Mogg. Or Jake Berry. Now officially banned from being mentioned in the same breath as their hero. From now on, “to do a Johnson” is officially translated in Hansard as “to habitually tell lies”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/21/has-rishi-sunak-been-taking-honesty-lessons-from-boris-johnson">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Lee Carsley’s European Under-21 Championship squad want to be England’s first victors since 1984 and to stake a senior claim</p><p>Some of the brightest young talents in English football have congregated in the city known as the Las Vegas of the Black Sea, but Jack Grealish need not fear he is missing out. Rather than looking to tour Batumi’s famed clubs and casinos, Lee Carsley’s England Under-21s squad have travelled to this subtropical region of Georgia at the foot of the Caucasus for business rather than pleasure.</p><p>If their principal mission is to be the first England side to win this age group’s European Championship since that of 1984, Carsley’s players will also be hoping to catch the eye of Gareth Southgate as they kick off their campaign against the Czech Republic on Thursday evening. The England manager’s attendance at a 16-team tournament jointly hosted by Georgia and Romania emphasises its role as a form of international finishing school.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/21/england-under-21s-european-championship-georgia-gareth-southgate">Continue reading...</a>

Dettori seized control of the Queen’s Vase from the off aboard Gregory, the even-money favourite, and simply refused to yield as Saint George and Oisin Murphy ground their way to within a head of the leader in the straight.</p><p>It was the moment that Dettori and also the meeting had needed, and having fought off Saint George after he came alongside a furlong out, Gregory stayed on again to finish a length-and-a-half clear at the line.

That something as basic as water is being mismanaged, and has been for decades, is shocking. This is especially so given that our taxes fund expert regulators to act on our behalf and oversee this resource, and the water companies that provide the services.</p><p>When the head of the Environment Agency confessed that our resource management systems were more than 50 years old, it was like saying our businesses are still running on typewriters and carbon paper. It is made more depressing because I spent a career in the water sector, including decades in developing countries.

<p>Hounded by sections of the media for political correctness, Australia’s leader made vital contributions with bat and ball</p><p>In the moment after striking the winning boundary at Edgbaston, Pat Cummins looked to have taken his celebration cues from Usman Khawaja. Charging down the pitch for a second run that became obsolete as the ball ricocheted into the rope, he embarked on the turning circle of a semi-trailer back towards Nathan Lyon at the far end and started throwing his gear away as he went. Bat? Didn’t need that any more. Bear hug? That was far more pressing.</p><p>It was emotion bursting out in its purest form, something instinctive. “I can’t really remember any of it, to be honest,” he told BBC radio, eyes and mind and limbic system still adjusting after the adrenaline bath of those final overs. On one part, though, he was very clear. “Never thought of a draw,” he said about the over when he clubbed two sixes off Joe Root, dynamiting the target down to 37, making the chase seem possible again after Alex Carey’s wicket.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/21/cricket-pat-cummins-answers-critics-with-one-of-great-ashes-captain-displays">Continue reading...</a>

## Final Fantasy XVI review – sophisticated spectacle is a breath of fresh air

<p><strong>Square Enix; PS5<br /></strong>A more mature and realistic tone, stunning performances, a rounded likable hero and a fully realised world make up for moments when this epic 40-hour game becomes a chore</p><p>What makes a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/final-fantasy">Final Fantasy</a>? Given the frequent tone changes for the series – this one boasts an obvious Game of Thrones influence and a mature age rating – it’s an open question, but fans come back for more than just chocobos and moogles. For me, Final Fantasy is more of a mood. Other fans can rest easy – there is still much of the series’ DNA in Final Fantasy XVI, and that is ultimately what helps the game in its weaker moments.</p><p>The game radiates a sense of care, in its themes and in the way characters treat one another. Like Final Fantasy VII, it reminds us that we have one planet to live on and that we should treat one another with kindness. Sure there is swearing and violence, but they are genuine expressions of desperation and surprise, and they feel earned. Who wouldn’t swear at seeing a monster the size of a mountain raze everything in its path?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jun/21/final-fantasy-xvi-review-square-enix-ps5">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Striker believes her January move from Chelsea to Spurs is the main reason she is part of the Lionesses squad </p><p>“The risk paid off,” Bethany England says, sounding like a gambler who has just cleaned up on the Strip rather than a footballer standing in the rain on a dreary day in east Staffordshire. The setting may be somewhat incongruous for such a bold statement but, ultimately, that does not make it any less justified, for this is very much someone who rolled the dice and won big.</p><p>England is part of England’s squad for the Women’s World Cup and reflecting on how that came about the 29-year-old is in no doubt of the moment that changed everything, the moment the doors slid in her favour: her <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/04/bethany-england-transfer-tottenham-chelsea-wsl-record-deal">move from Chelsea to Tottenham in January</a>. It was not an easy decision, especially for someone who, by her own admission, “has never dealt well with change”, and there was immediate pressure given the £250,000 fee, a domestic record for a British player in the women’s game. But it simply had to be done given the striker’s lack of game time allied to her desperate desire to travel to Australia and New Zealand with the Lionesses. England needed to be playing and scoring again and Spurs offered her that opportunity. She well and truly took it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/21/bethany-england-womens-world-cup-australia-new-zealand">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘As you can tell by their closed eyes, all the women around me that day were exhausted. In Iran, women have to be superheroes to overcome all the restrictions they face’</p><p></p><p></p><p>I was born in Tehran and live there still today. I took this on my way home from work after a tiring day. I work for one of Iran’s news agencies, where my duties include editing other photographers’ reportage and shooting on assignment. On the bus that day, the women around me, as you can tell by their closed eyes, were also exhausted.</p><p>I took it discreetly with my iPhone, and I knew straight away that it was a powerful image. It speaks to a sense of loneliness – the isolation that comes with working in the capital, an issue for all workers regardless of gender. The black and white accentuates that feeling. Its formal composition, the sense of movement and strong diagonals also make it striking. Behind is the Chamran Expressway against the Alborz mountain range and the Milad Tower – one of the city’s most recognisable landmarks. The tallest tower in Iran and the sixth tallest telecommunication tower in the world, it has become a symbol of Tehran. Although initial construction plans began in the mid-70s under the last Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, it wasn’t built until long after the 1979 revolution, when Iran became an “Islamic republic”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/21/iranian-women-farnaz-damnabis-best-photograph">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Barbican, London<br /></strong>In this intriguing show, the photographer, film-maker and dancer explores the Black American experience from a wide range of angles</p><p>Carrie Mae Weems appears and disappears among the endless rows of concrete slabs that make up Berlin’s Holocaust Memorial. She’s there and then she isn’t in this short film, traversing past and present in the late winter sunshine, wringing her hands, catching her breath. As she moves out of sight, distant traffic glints brightly at the far end of the row. Later, in two series of photographs, we see her – always from behind in the same long black gown – in the ruins of ancient Rome and also among Mussolini’s fascist architecture. And here she is again, outside the Louvre in Paris and Frank Gehry’s Guggenheim Bilbao, then in Philadelphia, Dresden and Boston. The figure in the long black gown is Weems playing the role of her own alter ego, her personal muse. She’s an African American witness at large in the world. For all that, Weems is hard to pin down – and the Barbican’s Reflections for Now show traces the complexities of her development.</p><p>Weems, who trained as a dancer before embarking on photography and art, often appears as a protagonist in her work. Now 70, she takes photographs, constructs installations and makes films. She also writes – and her words are a constant presence in this, the largest UK show of her work since the 1980s. Her art is rich and full of variety, without wavering from her focus on the Black American experience.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/21/carrie-mae-weems-review-evil-clowns-race-riots-and-tense-kitchen-table-dramas">Continue reading...</a>

## Private schools are on the offensive because Labour looms – and their privileges are under threat | Lola Okolosie

<p>Britain’s fee-paying schools could soon lose their controversial VAT exemption, and fear their protests are falling on closed ears</p><p>How do you square the circle that is a 20% tax exemption for wealthy people? That is the difficult question the Independent Schools Council (ISC), the lobby group for the UK’s private schools, finds itself trying to answer. Accepting that it is “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/15/private-school-officials-called-labour-minister-chippy-in-private-messages">increasingly likely</a>” that Labour – which has a policy of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/may/31/small-independent-schools-on-labour-private-school-tax-policy">charging VAT</a> on private school fees – will win the next election, the body representing independent schools has stepped up its tactics.</p><p>In its fightback against one of the few policies that puts clear daylight between the Tories and Labour, the ISC has written to MPs and contacted private schools – one letter gives schools “a template that Labour insiders suggest could be shared with parents to try to discredit the party’s policy”. This prompted party figures to warn that they could write to the Charity Commission about private schools expressing political opinions or engaging in political campaigns. Were all this not enough, the lobby group’s own emails reveal that officials described Labour’s shadow education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, as “chippy” – someone who “doesn’t know diddly” and can not “appreciate the great good our sector does”.</p><p>Lola Okolosie is an English teacher and writer focusing on race, politics, education and feminism</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/21/private-schools-labour-britain-fee-paying-vat-exemption">Continue reading...</a>

## Les Siècles review – Raw, radical and revelatory as Roth’s period band thrill

<p><strong>Barbican, London<br /></strong>François-Xavier Roth led an exhilarating and illuminating programme that moved through 80 years of French music, from Berlioz to Boulanger</p><p>There are symphony orchestras and there are period instrument bands, and then there is Les Siècles. Founded in 2003, François-Xavier Roth’s crack French ensemble pulls off the remarkable feat of finessing a dizzying array of music on instruments specific to the time of composition. What’s more, they do it all in the same concert. As a London Symphony Orchestra principal guest conductor, Roth is no stranger to these shores, but this was the first time he’s brought his Paris-based outfit to the Barbican, an event well worth the waiting for.</p><p>The programme spanned 80 years of French music: from 1841 and Berlioz’s frothy take on Weber’s Invitation to the Dance to Lili Boulanger’s death-haunted D’un soir triste. The latter was written in 1918, the year she died at the age of 24. Tonal contrasts throughout were revelatory. The diaphanous textures of Debussy’s Prélude à l’après-midi d’un faune responded instinctively to the gut strings and mellow early-1900s horns. The sound was warm, though never amorphous, in a performance shot through with airiness and light. By contrast, the Berlioz was rich and hefty, an intoxicating waltz fed by a raw, earthy energy. The change to natural horns here lent the music a brazen theatricality.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/21/les-siecles-review-barbican-francois-xavier-roth-berlioz-boulanger">Continue reading...</a>

<p>More women are feeling backed into a corner after the supreme court struck down the nationwide right to abortion last year</p><p>The last thing Jana wanted was to go back on hormonal birth control. But after Roe v Wade<em> </em>was overturned, prompting abortion bans in her state and ones around her, she felt she didn’t have a choice.</p><p>Jana, who asked to go by a pseudonym because she doesn’t want her politically conservative family to know her story, started using birth control at 13. For nearly a decade, she tried different kinds of hormonal contraception to find the one that least exacerbated anxiety and depression. Her weight fluctuated, making her eating disorder even worse. After nearly a decade, her therapist suggested she get off birth control altogether. It worked. She felt in touch with her adult body for the first time in her life, and her mental health was finally in a good place. She started using apps to track her menstrual cycle, to tell her when she was ovulating and should avoid sex or use a condom.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/21/roe-reversal-dobbs-decision-birth-control">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Novelists including Virginia Woolf and Georgette Heyer prove that women are just as capable of  bold escapes and derring-do  as men</p><p>One rainy holiday, Robert Louis Stevenson came up with the story of Treasure Island to entertain his stepson. The pair agreed that “it was to be a story for boys ... Women were excluded”.</p><p>This gender division was by no means new in adventure stories. In the 18th century, “a lady of adventure” was a prostitute. Early novelists including Aphra Behn, Anne Radcliffe and Charlotte Lennox, and memoirists such as Laetitia Pilkington, wrote stories of women expanding their horizons in far-flung, historical or gothic spaces. The act of publication was often just as scandalous as the contents. Samuel Richardson, whose novel Clarissa (1748) features a woman defending herself from attempted rape for over 1,000 pages, called these authors a “set of wretches” for failing to meet his standards of femininity. Jonathan Swift called Pilkington a “profligate whore”, though he admired her wit – which, we can all agree, was awfully nice of him.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/21/top-10-adventure-stories-for-girls">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Exclusive</strong>: Crown Prosecution Service claims no one is convicted solely via lyrics, but shocking new research finds juries being shown music and dance as evidence of guilt</p><p>On 6 February 2020, around 11.15am, a 16-year-old boy stepped out of Brighton’s Regent Hotel and walked towards the terraced green of Regency Square. He had with him a handful of small, pebble-sized packages, some bound in blue plastic, the others in white. The different colours let him know which contained heroin, and which cocaine. Plain clothes police officers watching the boy soon discovered another 115 similar wraps in the hotel room he had been staying in.</p><p>Just over a year later, at the crown court in Lewes, a jury convicted the boy, who had been sent to Brighton by a north London gang known as the Mali Boys, of two counts of being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/21/behind-bars-how-rap-lyrics-are-being-used-to-convict-black-british-men">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The definitive guide to making this salty-sweet, deliciously oily yet crisp and fluffy Italian-French repast – think onion, olive and anchovy pizza</p><p>Visitors to the Côte d’Azur don’t need to set foot in a museum to clock that the region was for a long time under Italian control. In fact, it became part of France only as recently as 1860, which explains why the traditional dialect, architecture and, most obviously, cooking all have a distinctly Ligurian feel (and why there’s a statue of Giuseppe <a href="https://www.deliciousmagazine.co.uk/recipes/garibaldi-biscuits/">Garibaldi</a> in <a href="https://www.bakingmartha.co.uk/blog/2016/2/22/old-fashioned-nice-biscuits">Nice</a>, his birthplace).</p><p>It’s unsurprising, then, that pissaladière, “a typically Niçoise hors d’oeuvre”, according to the city’s disgraced former mayor <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-jacques-medecin-1186011.html">Jacques Médecin</a>, bears more than a passing resemblance to pizza. (Indeed, food writer Caroline Craig, whose family hails from farther west, fancifully dates the Provençal fondness for the stuff to the Roman occupation, while <a href="https://www.jonathanmeades.co.uk/">Jonathan Meades</a> believes that Marseille does better pizza than Naples). But, as <a href="https://noblerot.co.uk/restaurant/soho">Noble Rot Soho’s chef Alex Jackson</a> observes, whatever you liken it to, pissaladière is “much more than the sum of its parts. To call it ‘onion tart [or pizza] with anchovies and olives’ somehow underplays it”. Salty-sweet and deliciously oily, it’s ideal cut into small squares and paired with a well-chilled aperitif or, served in more generous wedges, with a green salad. Sunshine optional.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/21/how-to-make-the-perfect-pissaladiere-recipe-felicity-cloake">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Forget your inhibitions this summer. Instead, wear colourful clothes, get enough rest and celebrate every personal best</p><p>Unless your body is morgue-ready – in which case, please remain in situ – then your living, breathing human self is beach-ready just the way it is.

Many of us find it relatively straightforward to be kind (and relatively less judgmental) towards other people. Because all you have to do is remember not to be a cruel git. But when it comes to our view of ourselves, we can be over harsh and critical, submitting ourselves to a level of scrutiny that we wouldn’t dream of applying to others.</p><p>But the 1980s idea that we must all prepare ourselves for the Great Unveiling of the Socially Acceptable Flesh and improve our aesthetic qualities before we venture near a beach or swimming pool … Well, that has kind of had its day.

I was with a friend who had never heard of it, and so a couple of hours later we were playing it on the Switch in a pub, honking and flapping and making life difficult for any human unfortunate enough to cross our path. The sheer physical comedy of the game – the goose’s waddling gait, the appalled reactions of the villagers, the mischievous glee of running away from a gardener with a trowel in my beak and throwing it into the pond – is delightful. If anything, it’s even funnier now, because you can play with two geese (one of you can run interference while the other steals sandwiches).</p><p>When people talk about funny video games, they often mention Monkey Island or Sam and Max – games with quippy writing and witty characters, wordplay, and self-referential puzzle design.

<p>Far from being persecuted, Trump has been handled with vastly more deference than anyone else would be</p><p>Donald Trump’s indictment earlier this month on 37 counts related to mishandling classified information set off <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-indictment-republicans-say-biden-weaponizing-doj-rcna87962">a firestorm</a> on the political right. Conservatives accused Joe Biden of using the justice system to prosecute his main political rival and attempting to “steal” the 2024 election. Kevin McCarthy, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, promised to “hold this brazen weaponization of power accountable”. In short, the right wants us to believe that Biden and his administration will stop at nothing to put Trump in jail as quickly as possible.</p><p>In fact, the exact opposite is true. Worried about just this type of accusation, the justice department under Merrick Garland and the FBI have approached their investigations of Trump much too cautiously. Far from being persecuted because of who he is, Trump’s status as a former president and as the unofficial leader of the Republican party have led to him being handled with vastly more deference than anyone else would be. The result has been a series of delays and missteps which may allow Trump to escape accountability once again.</p><p>Andrew Gawthorpe is a historian of the United States at Leiden University.

## Reproduction by Louisa Hall review – pregnancy, pain and Frankenstein

<p>A visceral novel about Mary Shelley, the violence of procreation and our overheating planet</p><p>Are pregnancy and childbirth the most or least natural things we do? At the heart of Louisa Hall’s brainily visceral new novel is a reading of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/11/100-best-novels-frankenstein-mary-shelley" title="">Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein</a><em> </em>as a book whose uncanny energy is forged in the crucible of reproduction. Pregnant, nauseous, fearful of miscarriage, Hall’s narrator fails in her attempt to write a novel about Shelley, in part because her insights about Shelley’s masterpiece have become too turbulent and revelatory. “How could she,” the narrator asks, “a creature who never had a mother, have observed such physical changes with anything other than terror? What am I? she must have wondered. What kind of creature is this?”</p><p>Hall is best known for her ambitious AI novel <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/21/speak-louisa-hall-book-review" title="">Speak</a> (2015), which intertwines letters, diaries and court transcripts across several centuries to tell the tragic story of the rise and fall of a generation of intelligent, human-seeming dolls. She has now turned her attention inward, in this short, intricate work of autofiction about pregnancy and childbirth. But the preoccupations of Speak are still here: a thread about IVF introduces questions about the relationship between scientific overreaching and “natural” biology, darkened by an increasingly unnatural climate.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/21/reproduction-by-louisa-hall-review-pregnancy-pain-and-frankenstein">Continue reading...</a>

## The Wicker Man review – brilliant conspiracy chiller is a one-movie genre in itself

<p>The satirical masterpiece  goes well beyond what one expects from folk horror, with Edward Woodward as the priggish cop sent to investigate a pagan island</p><p>After 50 years, here is a re-release for that gamey satirical masterpiece of folk horror – although “prog horror” is perhaps a better description. Folk horror, like film noir, is a term that seems to have been first used by critics before film-makers themselves, but The Wicker Man is so much better and more distinctive than any film that comes under the folk-horror heading that it’s virtually a one-movie genre in itself. It now appears billed as a “final cut”: a restoration complete with the footage that was excised when it was released as a B-picture support to Don’t Look Now in 1973.<br /><br />It is a brilliant conspiracy-chiller set on May Day on a remote fictional island off the Scottish coast, ruled over by the haughty laird Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee), whose inhabitants are devoted to sinister pagan observances to preserve the annual fruit harvest on which their economy depends. The Summerislanders are variously polite and insolent towards a thin-lipped young copper from the mainland who has been alerted to the disappearance of a teenage girl by an anonymous letter. This is the fiercely respectable Sgt Neil Howie, wonderfully played by Edward Woodward, a stickler for the Christian religion, saving himself for marriage to his demure fiancee, and outraged and yet also faintly excited by the sensual abandonment he sees around him.</p><p>The film is a genuinely scary adventure in group psychopathology, carried off by director Robin Hardy with an inspired seriousness and density of imagined folkloric detail. It is all clearly inspired by Ira Levin at some level, but adapted by Anthony Shaffer from the 1967 novel Ritual by David Pinner, an actor-turned-writer who originally developed the story for Michael Winner and whose cop protagonist may owe something to a part that Pinner played in the West End: Sgt Trotter, from Agatha Christie’s The Mousetrap. (Like TS Eliot’s The Waste Land, incidentally, The Wicker Man is indebted to the images of death and rebirth from James Frazer’s The Golden Bough.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/21/the-wicker-man-review-one-of-a-kind-horror-returns-for-midsummer-nights-screaming">Continue reading...</a>

## The Driver’s Seat (AKA Identikit) review – Elizabeth Taylor captivates in bizarre 70s mystery

<p>Taylor is both hammy and subtle as a woman on the verge of a breakdown in this preposterous but watchable 1974 drama that features an extraordinary cameo from Andy Warhol</p><p>It’s peak 70s Liz Taylor in this arrestingly bizarre movie directed by Italian film-maker Giuseppe Patroni Griffi in 1974, which he co-adapted from the 1970 novella by Muriel Spark and was released under the title Identikit in the US. With her big sunglasses and permanently dishevelled jet-black hair, Taylor gives an intense and more-than-slightly alarming performance in a preposterous, slightly dated yet very watchable psycho-existential mystery, a cousin to the era’s paranoid thrillers. It was shot by Vittorio Storaro, who repeatedly directs light sources into the camera so that the figures often move like shadows behind a disconcerting glow, which is part of the film’s distinctive puzzle.</p><p>Taylor plays Lise, a single woman of a certain age who is clearly on the verge of a breakdown. Lise lives in Hamburg, where she is seen buying oddly garish, multicoloured clothes in a department store, high-handedly terrorising the sales assistants and announcing that these garments are appropriate for the warm, southern climes to which she says she is heading. We first see Lise drifting through a surreal department filled with naked mannequins; perhaps The Driver’s Seat has been an influence on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/peter-strickland">Peter Strickland</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/21/the-drivers-seat-aka-identikit-review-elizabeth-taylor-andy-warhol">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Festivals have to be slightly different and magical’: Orkney’s St Magnus festival

<p>Rooted in Orkney culture, the midsummer arts festival celebrates the past and the present of these beautiful islands, and, if the music of Peter Maxwell Davies is no longer its backbone, his guiding spirit remains</p><p>Saint Magnus’s death began the first ever St Magnus festival in 1977 with Peter Maxwell Davies’s opera The Martyrdom of St Magnus. His birth opens the 2023 festival in David McNeish’s powerful if static new play, Thora, gives a voice to the mother of the patron saint of Orkney. Magnificently brought to life by Isabella Jarrett, Thora, in her old age, tells her own story including the brutal rape that begat her son, whose own life ended in violence and whose skull is in Kirkwall’s 12th cathedral that bears his name.</p><p>The St Magnus festival was co-founded by Maxwell Davies, Orcadian poet George Mackay Brown, arts campaigner Marjorie Linklater and Norman Mitchell, music teacher and cathedral organist. Ticket sales have always been split equally between visitors and residents, but the local community was and remains at its heart, and the islands’ rich past is a tangible part of the midsummer festival, which takes in classical, contemporary and traditional music, literature and dance as well as drama.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/21/festivals-have-to-be-slightly-different-and-magical-orkneys-st-magnus-festival">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The final Frank Bascombe book explores happiness and denial, completing a social history of Ford’s own boomer generation from midlife to end times</p><p>In 1986, Richard Ford took an Alice Hoffman novel out into his back yard and shot it. Hoffman had had the temerity to give Ford’s third novel, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/19/richard-ford-book-club" title="">The Sportswriter</a>, a middling review in the New York Times. Ford at the time believed The Sportswriter to be his masterpiece. It tells the story of Frank Bascombe, once an author of short stories, now, in his late 30s, a sportswriter living a middle-class life in the ordinary town of Haddam, New Jersey.</p><p>Frank is, when we first meet him, divorced and mourning the death of his nine-year-old son, Ralph. The action of the novel begins in a cemetery, where Frank and his ex-wife pay a dawn visit to Ralph’s grave. Nonetheless, The Sportswriter is about that great American theme, the pursuit of happiness. Can you be happy in the face of the horrors that life throws at you? Frank’s answer is a provisional yes. Hoffman, in her review, suggested that Frank’s happiness was just a project of denial – that he was an egoist who “chooses to ignore tangled, emotionally charged family relationships, fixating instead on non-relationships and non-events”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/21/be-mine-by-richard-ford-review-america-the-fools-paradise">Continue reading...</a>

<p>No longer just for solstice, a new type of tourism means these mysterious rock formations are being visited year round. Our writer joins a stone hunt on the Cornish moors</p><p>Up on Cornwall’s Penwith Moors time takes a strange quality. Here the landscape is a morass of knotted bracken and bristly gorse, a soft marigold tinge signalling warmer summer days. A grey smudge of cloud sags on the horizon and the wind whirs like white noise, a low and disorientating murmur. The topography is a palimpsest, with working farms etched over ruinous mines and prehistoric settlements. And at its heart is a scattering of ancient stones, the enigmatic quoits, barrows and stone circles that have captivated and confounded societies for millennia.</p><p>It’s an enchanting place just to wander, but to help me dive deeper into the mysteries of the moors, I am meeting artists and stone enthusiasts Lally MacBeth and Matthew Shaw. Almost immediately I feel underdressed in hiking boots primed with mud and a hardy waterproof – in Cornwall, we come perpetually prepared for the threat of showers. MacBeth, on the other hand, looks the part of an antiquarian in an emerald-green blazer and matching beret finished with a swipe of ruby lipstick. The only muted part of her outfit is a monochrome badge, the size of a small pebble, that reads: “The Stone Club”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/jun/21/stone-circles-and-tombs-cornwall-uk">Continue reading...</a>

Crashing into a car is an extreme version of the same ploy and, if you hadn’t so quickly twigged that it was a scam, you might have lost more of your belongings. Axa’s response has been appalling. Insurers take care to hold customers to a deadline when making a claim, but tend to allow themselves indefinite time to process it. Axa requires claims to be submitted within 31 days of a theft, but its terms and conditions omit to bind it to any timescales.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jun/21/axa-has-gone-quiet-after-a-holiday-scam-brought-our-travel-plans-crashing-down">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Vilified as the scourge of perfect lawns, these tiny plants fight air pollution and keep soils healthy</p><p>Mosses are tiny plants often ignored or treated as the scourge of perfect lawns, and yet they are superheroes of the plant world. They help fight air pollution and the climate crisis, keep soils healthy, colonise bare ground paving the way for other plants to grow, and can survive harsh environments ranging from deserts to polar regions.</p><p>They lack proper roots and absorb all their nourishment like sponges through their leaves, which makes them particularly good at feeding on pollutants and fine particles of dust in the air. They soak up to 20 times their own weight in water, and when this evaporates it cools the surrounding air by up to 2C.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jun/21/moss-superheroes-plant-world-air-pollution">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘We all had to take our tops off’: Joanna Lumley on acting, travel – and her hatred of sex scenes

<p>Born in India to a military family, Lumley found fame as a model and actor in the 1960s. As she begins a new TV travel series, she discusses her ancestral history, single motherhood and the joy of playing Patsy Stone</p><p>‘I can’t bear places where you can’t open the windows,” says Joanna Lumley, sitting next to me on a sofa. She has just tried and failed to open the windows of the hotel room in which we meet. “And I can’t bear the thought of a year without a suitcase.”</p><p>Lumley has become almost as known for her travel programmes as for her acting roles – though nothing, of course, will ever eclipse her gloriously awful Patsy Stone in the 90s comedy Absolutely Fabulous – and recently has been off again. This time she journeys from Indonesia to Jordan, via India, Zanzibar and Madagascar, for the four-part ITV series Joanna Lumley’s Spice Trail Adventure. As ever, she is a great travel companion – enthusiastic about everything, beautifully polite and kind to everyone she meets – and I suspect you will never view your spice rack in the same blase way again after watching her programme. Hold a nutmeg in your hand and you are holding, according to one version of history, the kernel of the British empire.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jun/21/joanna-lumley-acting-travel-hatred-sex-scenes-we-had-take-our-tops-off">Continue reading...</a>
