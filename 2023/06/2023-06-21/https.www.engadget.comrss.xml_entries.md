<p>Twitter has resumed paying its Google Cloud contract, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-21/twitter-resumes-paying-google-cloud-patching-up-relationship?utm_medium=social&amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-tech&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_content=tech&amp;sref=10lNAhZ9#xj4y7vzkg"><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a>. If you missed the initial news of the impending showdown, <em>Platformer</em> reported on June 10th that Twitter had been refusing to pay Google for its cloud services ahead of their contract’s June 30th renewal date. The possibility of losing access to Google’s infrastructure led to a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-has-reportedly-refused-to-pay-its-google-cloud-contract-161936042.html"><ins>frantic rush</ins></a> at Twitter to migrate as many of its services off of Google’s servers. However, that effort was reportedly “running behind schedule,” opening the door for some of the company’s in-house tools to go offline come the end of the month.</p><p>Now it appears Twitter has found a way to avoid that scenario. <em>Bloomberg </em>reports <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-names-nbcu-ad-exec-linda-yaccarino-new-twitter-ceo-155537363.html"><ins>Linda Yaccarino</ins></a>, the company’s newly appointed CEO, “helped get the relationship back on track.” In fact, the two companies are reportedly negotiating a broader partnership that could include advertising and Google’s use of Twitter’s paid API. Twitter does not operate a public relations department Engadget could contact for comment.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Twitter’s Google Cloud contract dates back to 2018. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, the contract has cost the company between $200 million and $300 million annually and was one of the early targets of Elon Musk’s cost-cutting. Google reportedly “struggled” to get in touch with the billionaire to talk about Twitter’s unpaid bills, and at one point attempted to reach him through SpaceX, which also does business with the tech giant.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/twitter-has-supposedly-started-paying-its-google-cloud-bill-again-213824844.html?src=rss

<p>Earlier this year, AST SpaceMobile, with the help of AT&amp;T, managed to connect an off-the-shelf Samsung Galaxy S22 to a satellite in low-Earth orbit to complete a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/att-completes-the-first-space-based-voice-call-using-a-standard-smartphone-120012437.html"><ins>two-way voice call</ins></a>.

<p><em>EVE Online</em> has finally embraced its destiny. The game, often jokingly called a “spreadsheet simulator” due to the competitive advantages its most dedicated players can gain by tracking in-game data, now has a Microsoft Excel add-in. “Gain a competitive edge by harnessing the power of data, as access to and the understanding of data can spell the difference between victory and defeat,” developer CCP Games wrote Tuesday in a <a href="https://www.eveonline.com/news/view/information-is-power-excel-release">blog post</a>. The free extension, first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/eve-online-microsoft-excel-partership-spreadsheet-161108942.html">announced last year</a> at EVE Fanfest, is available now.</p><p>Besides serving as crossover marketing for CCP Games and Microsoft, the add-in could help level the playing field and make it easier for new players to enjoy the long-running MMO. “You can now quickly and efficiently arm yourself with the information and knowledge to reach your goals and aspirations,” the development team said. “Easy access to in-game data facilitates decision making and brings added fairness and accessibility to everyone, without requiring coding knowledge or dependence on player-developed third-party tools.” CCP Games collaborated with Microsoft’s Excel team to create the add-in.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Available data includes “your assets with location and item value, market orders, item market prices, wallet transactions, skills, as well as an overview of corporation finances (if you have required roles) to make informed decisions.” After importing your in-game information, you can generate custom reports or visualization tools like graphs and charts. The developer describes it as the “first and only” video game to offer official Excel-based data integration.</p><p>“CCP Games has extensive experience in the MMO space, so it’s only natural that we collaborate with them to launch the first-ever native Microsoft Excel add-in for a video game,” said Catherine Pidgeon, Microsoft’s Head of Product, Excel. “With the add-in, the <em>EVE Online</em> player base can seamlessly export and manage data without third-party tools. Through this collaboration, we’re excited to see how players of <em>EVE Online</em> of all skill levels can use Excel to streamline data management and take their in-game experience to new heights.”</p><p>To try out the tool, select the “Insert” tab in Excel (desktop or web) and then the “Get Add-ins” button, and look for <em>EVE Online</em>. Alternatively, you can find the add-in <a href="https://excel.new">in the Microsoft Store</a>. Finally, CCP Games launched a <a href="https://ccpgames.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/EVEExceladd-in/EenbFfUFKqFJveetDBh2z5gBDgL6QWZ-YZeMfxEVyeCVtQ?rtime=G6EC3p9w20g">sample workbook</a> to help you get started.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/eve-onlines-spreadsheets-in-space-now-integrate-seamlessly-with-microsoft-excel-194719853.html?src=rss

## House and Senate bills aim to protect journalists' data from government surveillance

<p>News gatherers in the US may soon have safeguards against government attempts to comb through their data. Bipartisan House and Senate groups have <a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wyden-lee-and-durbin-introduce-press-act-to-protect-reporters-first-amendment-rights-against-government-surveillance">reintroduced</a> legislation, the PRESS Act (Protect Reporters from Exploitive State Spying), that limits the government's ability to compel data disclosures that might identify journalists' sources. The Senate bill, would extend disclosure exemptions and standards to cover email, phone records, and other info third parties hold.</p><p>The PRESS Act would also require that the federal government gives journalists a chance to respond to data requests. Courts could still demand disclosure if it's necessary to prevent terrorism, identify terrorists or prevent serious "imminent" violence. The Senate bill is the work of Richard Durbin, Mike Lee and Ron Wyden, while the House equivalent comes from representatives Kevin Kiley and Jamie Raskin.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Sponsors characterize the bill as vital to protecting First Amendment press freedoms. Anonymous source leaks help keep the government accountable, Wyden says. He adds that surveillance like this can deter reporters and sources worried about retaliation. Lee, meanwhile, says the Act will also maintain the public's "right to access information" and help it participate in a representative democracy.</p><p>The senators point to instances from both Democratic and Republican administrations where law enforcement subpoenaed data in a bid to catch sources. Most notably, the Justice Department under Trump is known to have <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjODEzYWUzOS03ZDU4LTQxY2ItYWM2Ni1hZDgzMDYwNmNlZWYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMS8wNi8wMi91cy90cnVtcC1hZG1pbmlzdHJhdGlvbi1waG9uZS1yZWNvcmRzLXRpbWVzLXJlcG9ydGVycy5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwOTYzZThjMC00M2NlLTQ4MzMtOGQwZC0wYjU4NGE5ZTFiZGEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARFpHHp4yYhO6MXuYxneMtP5pbG6zYcF2tepaQqDxTWG&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2021%2F06%2F02%2Fus%2Ftrump-administration-phone-records-times-reporters.html">seized</a> call records and email logs from major media outlets like <em>CNN</em> and <em>The New York Times</em> following an April 2017 report on how former FBI director James Comey handled investigations during the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>Journalist shield laws exist in 48 states and the District of Columbia, but there's no federal law. That void lets the Justice Department and other government bodies quietly grab data from telecoms and other providers. The PRESS Act theoretically patches that hole and minimizes the chances of abuse.</p><p>There's no guarantee the PRESS Act will reach President Biden's desk and become law. However, both Congress camps are betting that bipartisan support will help. The House version passed "unanimously" in the previous session of Congress, Wyden's office says.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/house-and-senate-bills-aim-to-protect-journalists-data-from-government-surveillance-192907280.html?src=rss

## Microsoft is raising Xbox Series X and Game Pass prices in most countries

<p>If you've been interested in picking up an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/xbox-series-x/">Xbox Series X</a>, it may be wise to do so by the end of July unless you're in the US, Japan, Chile, Brazil or Colombia. Microsoft confirmed to Engadget that it's increasing the price of the console in most other countries.</p><p>Starting on August 1st, the Xbox Series X will cost $650 CAD in Canada, £480 in the UK, €550 in most European countries and $800 AUD in Australia. The increases are roughly in line with the PS5 price changes <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-raises-playstation-5-pricing-082732792.html">Sony made in most markets last year</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“We’ve held on our prices for consoles for many years and have adjusted the prices to reflect the competitive conditions in each market,” Xbox communications chief Kari Perez told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/21/23768400/microsoft-xbox-series-x-xbox-game-pass-price-increase"><em>The Verge.</em></a> “These Game Pass price adjustments are not related to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-merger-temporarily-blocked-by-us-judge-061933491.html">Activision Blizzard deal</a> and are intended to match local market conditions.&quot;</p><p>The Xbox Series S pricing is staying the same in all markets at $250 (or the local equivalent). Microsoft will soon introduce <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-series-s-will-be-available-with-1tb-storage-in-black-for-349-on-september-1st-181414018.html">a black model with 1TB of storage for $349</a>.</p><p>Microsoft's own studios are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-is-no-longer-making-new-games-for-the-xbox-one-174452073.html">no longer making games for the Xbox One</a>. If you don't want to buy a Series X or S, you can still stream upcoming games like <em>Starfield </em>and <em>Fable </em>to the older console through Game Pass Ultimate. But guess what? That service is getting a price hike too, including in the US.</p><p>Xbox Game Pass will soon cost $11 per month, an increase of $1. Game Pass Ultimate is getting a bigger jump, from $15 per month to $17. <em>The Verge </em>has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/21/23768400/microsoft-xbox-series-x-xbox-game-pass-price-increase">a list</a> of the price increases for other markets. The price of PC Game Pass (which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-game-pass-pc-price-increase-september-17-082218831.html">doubled from $5 to $10 per month</a> in 2020) is not changing, while Xbox Game Pass won't be going up in Norway, Chile, Denmark, Switzerland or Saudi Arabia.</p><p>The price changes will take effect for new Xbox Game Pass members on July 6th. It won't apply for existing subscribers until August 13th (September 13th in Germany). If you happen to have access to Game Pass through an annual code, the price changes won't affect you until it's time for you to renew.</p><p>This is the first time that Microsoft has increased Game Pass pricing since it introduced the service in 2017 as part of a transition away from Xbox Live Gold. Still, it was inevitable that the prices would go up at some point. The importance of Game Pass to Xbox's business model was undoubtedly a factor in the decision.</p><p>Conversely, you might have expected the price of the Xbox Series X to <em>drop </em>at this point in its lifecycle, not to increase. Microsoft can't pin the blame on a console shortage — Xbox head Phil Spencer recently said the company had <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-has-increased-xbox-series-xors-stock-supply-while-debuting-an-all-new-xbox-series-s">increased the supply</a> of Xbox Series X/S. Instead, Microsoft suggested the Series X increase is due to market conditions such as inflation and currency fluctuations.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-is-increasing-xbox-series-x-and-game-pass-prices-in-most-countries-182635680.html?src=rss

## Otter’s AI chatbot pays attention during meetings so you don’t have to

<p>Otter.ai just announced Otter Chat, an AI chatbot <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL290dGVyLmFpL2Jsb2cvb3R0ZXItYWktY2hhdC1haS1wb3dlcmVkLW1lZXRpbmctYXNzaXN0YW50IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyMzU3Y2U3NC03NmExLTQwNzAtYmIwZC0zNTM4ZDY2MzFhYTEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAaRJ7qC1BTPD16vcx-MCLkVnS8-azFipj6bzgzCpjM9T&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fotter.ai%2Fblog%2Fotter-ai-chat-ai-powered-meeting-assistant"><ins>specifically designed for work meetings.</ins></a> This “collaborative AI intelligence” acts as a help center for anyone participating in the meeting, transcribing meeting data and winnowing it down into an actual conversation. This allows it to accurately answer questions about the meeting that just transpired, in case you were busy doing important work stuff like, uh, playing the new Zelda just out of frame.</p><p>The cheekily-named OtterPilot chatbot does more than just summarize meetings. It collaborates with everyone involved to generate content based on meeting data, like blog posts and follow-up emails. It’s sort of like an unpaid intern, but without the ability to go out and fetch coffee (for now.) The company says this is a major step up from platforms like ChatGPT, as they source information from public data, whereas Otter AI Chat sources information from actual team meetings. The toolset is collaborative in nature, so the chatbot communicates with every team member simultaneously or on a one-on-one basis. You can even have a related bot attend the meeting in your stead. Work/life balance, baby!&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="5cbe2065cd04404d9afd4fa660d81cd0"></div><p>This little bot also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/otter-ai-meeting-summary-120032728.html"><ins>does the standard stuff</ins></a> that has made Otter.ai a popular destination for remote workers. It transcribes entire meetings, summarizes contents into easily digestible formats, creates lists of actionable items and much more.</p><p>Otter says its AI systems are already used to transcribe over one million words every minute and over one billion words since launching last year. Otter AI Chat rolls out to all users in the coming days, so check your update field. The company also says no information will be stored by third parties when using the service, which is always nice.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/otters-ai-chatbot-pays-attention-during-meetings-so-you-dont-have-to-174103036.html?src=rss

## Dropbox’s new tools reimagine the cloud service as your AI sidekick

<p>Dropbox <a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/product/introducing-AI-powered-tools">announced</a> two new products today that (not quite shockingly) shift the company’s focus to AI. Dropbox AI scans your documents, providing summaries and answers, while the more ambitious Dropbox Dash serves as a unified search bar for your life.</p><p>Dropbox AI is the simpler of the two new offerings. It applies artificial intelligence to file previews, offering summaries and a natural language Q&amp;A about your docs. “With the click of a button, you can summarize your content, like contracts and meeting recordings, into a concise explanation,” the company explained. Or, ask Dropbox AI questions about the content of a specific file, and it can answer. “With Dropbox AI, now you can pull up a file, ask it anything, and Dropbox will read the document for you and give you an answer,” CEO Drew Houston said in a promotional video.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Meanwhile, Dropbox Dash has a much broader scope, essentially serving as a souped-up and AI-powered version of Apple Spotlight search, Windows Search or third-party launcher apps like Alfred. Dropbox wants Dash to be your one-stop shop for anything you need to know — locally or online. “Dropbox Dash is AI-powered universal search that connects all of your tools, content, and apps in a single search bar,” the company wrote. “With connectors to major platforms like Google Workspace, Microsoft Outlook, Salesforce, and more, you can find everything in one place, fast.” The idea is to provide customers with a ChatGPT-like dialog box that answers questions about all the personal and work-related content in your digital universe.</p><figure><img alt="Screenshot (over teal blue background) of a browser window with an overlay for Dropbox Dash. A cursor is hovering over a back arrow as the result " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/871cac30-1052-11ee-a87a-a142f3a8d0d6" style="height: 1080px; width: 1800px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Dropbox</div></figure><p>In addition to being a universal search bar, Dropbox Dash is also a browser extension. The company organizes URLs into Stacks, described as “Smart collections for your links that offer a quick way to save, organize, and retrieve URLs” — similar to how playlists store songs. The extension also adds a start-page dashboard showing search, Stacks, shortcuts and other suggested contextual items. Finally, Dropbox says Dash will eventually “pull from your information and your company’s information to answer questions and surface relevant content using generative AI.” (For example, you could skip searching your business’s internal links and pages and ask Dash when the next company holiday is.)</p><p>Trusting a company with all that data is a tall order. Dropbox wants to assure customers that it’s prepared for that responsibility — pledging to be transparent and not sell your data to advertisers. “In this next era of AI, it’s more important than ever that we protect our customers’ privacy, act transparently, and limit bias in our AI technologies so they’re built as fairly and reliably as possible,” the company said.</p><p>As lofty as Dropbox’s ambitions are with Dash, I can’t help but see an AI-powered “search box for everything” as a logical extension of modern operating systems. I’d be surprised if Apple, Microsoft and Google haven’t already been working on their versions of an AI-infused universal search bar to eventually bake into their products on the OS level. If those suspicions are correct, that could leave Dropbox with a brief window to establish Dash before the heavy hitters step in and make a third-party variant redundant for most customers.</p><p>Dropbox AI for file previews is available in alpha today for Dropbox Pro customers in the US. In addition, it will “start rolling out” for “select Dropbox Teams.” Finally, you can <a href="https://dropbox.com/dash">sign up to join the waitlist</a> for Dropbox Dash.</p><div id="77a8b7c7eb5f442081b36c50d2d098c3"></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/dropboxs-new-tools-reimagine-the-cloud-service-as-your-ai-sidekick-171544676.html?src=rss

<p>Konami has finally shared a release date for<em> Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1</em>. In case you missed the publisher’s original announcement, Konami announced the compilation alongside <a href="https://www.engadget.com/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater-is-being-remade-for-modern-platforms-204716222.html"><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em></a> during Sony’s recent PlayStation Showcase.

## 'Batman: Arkham Trilogy' comes to Switch this fall

<p>You'll soon have a way to revisit Rocksteady's best-known games on a Nintendo handheld. Warner Bros. Games has <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230621059757/en/Warner-Bros.-Games-and-DC-Announce-Batman%E2%84%A2-Arkham-Trilogy-for-Nintendo-Switch%E2%84%A2">revealed</a> that <em>Batman: Arkham Trilogy</em> will release on the Switch sometime this fall. The bundle will include <em>Arkham Asylum</em>, <em>Arkham City</em> and <em>Arkham Knight</em> as well as all the previously-released DLC for the trio. There's no mention of Switch-specific features, but Turn Me Up Games (involved in Switch ports for <em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2</em> and <em>It Takes Two</em>) is responsible for the adaptation.</p><p><em>Arkham Asylum</em> revolves around Batman's fight against The Joker and allies as they take over the game's namesake asylum. <em>Arkham City</em> expands the battle to Gotham and includes more classic villains, such as Mr. Freeze and The Penguin. <em>Arkham Knight</em> adds its titular supervillain and introduces more open-world gameplay that includes a drivable Batmobile.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="3f0f8d99977b428ba0155d11e64021bb"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>For the most part, all three games earned a reputation for an engaging story and varied gameplay that included combat, stealth and puzzle solving. The brawls were a particular highlight — you were rewarded for performing seamless combos while dodging opponents that can come from multiple directions at once. The series arguably popularized a fight formula that has surfaced in games ranging from <em>Spider-Man</em> to <em>Shadow of Mordor</em>. Throw in the animated Batman' series voice cast (such as Mark Hamill and the late Kevin Conroy) and it's easy to see the appeal for fans of the caped hero.</p><p>This won't thrill Switch fans who were hoping for a version of Rocksteady's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-is-delayed-until-february-2nd-2024-201547147.html">upcoming <em>Suicide Squad</em> game</a>. This is more a bid to reach an untapped audience than to set the stage for the studio's first new game in nearly eight years. Still, you might not mind if you're either new to the franchise or want to revisit the series. If nothing else, it may serve as a palate cleanser for those who thought <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gotham-knights-october-21-release-date-up-195135689.html"><em>Gotham Knights</em></a> missed <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/gotham-knights">the mark</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/batman-arkham-trilogy-comes-to-switch-this-fall-163027577.html?src=rss

<p>Qualcomm expanded its <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/internet-of-things/consumer/audio/qualcomm-s3-gen-2-sound-platform">S3 Gen 2 Sound</a> platform today with an eye on gamers. The new chip, designed for dongles and adapters, can deliver sub-20ms latency while supplying an additional backchannel for voice chat.</p><p>The expansion to Qualcomm S3 Gen 2 Sound combines <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-sound-wireless-audio-quality-160036734.html">Snapdragon Sound</a> and LE Audio for “ultra-low latency of less than 20ms for lag-free wireless audio with voice back-channel for in-game chat.” The chip-maker notes that it reduces latency even more when skipping the voice chat and delivering game audio only. Additionally, a Qualcomm representative tells Engadget that it could also work with wireless charging cases with audio-transmission features (handy for wireless listening to in-flight entertainment).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It also supports the latest version of <a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/auracast/">Auracast</a>, a broadcast standard based on Bluetooth LE Audio.

<p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) isn't done with Amazon despite <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-settles-lawsuit-with-ftc-over-ring-doorbell-privacy-concerns-191257621.html">two recent</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-will-pay-25-million-to-settle-ftc-lawsuit-over-alexa-privacy-for-kids-193330840.html">settlements</a>. The agency <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/06/ftc-takes-action-against-amazon-enrolling-consumers-amazon-prime-without-consent-sabotaging-their">has sued</a> Amazon over claims the company fooled customers into signing up for Prime while simultaneously thwarting attempts to cancel. The online retailer allegedly violated the FTC Act and Restore Online Shoppers' Confidence Act through misleading designs that got users to register for Prime without true consent. Leaders even &quot;slowed or rejected&quot; design changes that would have made it easier to cancel Prime, the FTC argues.</p><p>We've asked Amazon for comment. In a statement, FTC chair Lina Khan maintains that Amazon &quot;tricked and trapped&quot; customers. This both angered users and cost them &quot;significant money,&quot; she says. The FTC also asserts that Amazon made multiple attempts to &quot;delay and hinder&quot; the investigation.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As <em>CNBC</em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/21/ftc-sues-amazon-over-deceptive-prime-sign-up-and-cancellation-process.html">notes</a>, the FTC has been investigating Amazon Prime sign-up and cancel systems since March 2021. The investigation deepened in 2022 after <em>Insider</em> said it <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-prime-ftc-probe-customer-complaints-sign-ups-internal-documents-2022-3">obtained</a> internal documents purportedly showing that Amazon was aware of customer objections as early as 2017. Shoppers were encouraged to sign up for a 30-day trial with a single click during checkout, but had to wade through multiple pages to cancel service before the trial ended. Amazon even used the term &quot;Iliad&quot; to describe the cancellation process, alluding to the sheer length of Homer's epic poem.</p><p>The FTC under Khan has closely scrutinized Amazon's practices. Officials have examined the internet giant's acquisitions <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-amazon-mgm-investigation-195722033.html">of MGM</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-completes-one-medical-acquisition-163431975.html">One Medical</a> as well as privacy issues with Alexa and Ring doorbells. Khan was a notable critic of Big Tech before her nomination as FTC chair, and Amazon even <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-ftc-chair-lina-khan-recusal-antitrust-investigations-181556108.html">called for her recusal</a> in antitrust cases over claimed bias.</p><p>The concept of deceptive design, also known as &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-13-websites-not-following-eu-gdpr-rules-study.html">dark patterns</a>,&quot; isn't new. In 2020, the European Union said that many websites made it unnecessarily difficult to reject tracking cookies.

<p>The terrific <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/vampire-survivors/"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a> is on the way to the Nintendo Switch.

<p>A rumor suggested that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-next-nintendo-direct-will-take-place-on-june-21st-145140349.html">today's Nintendo Direct</a> would include a remake of a SNES classic, and that looks to have held up. <em>Super Mario RPG</em> is back with &quot;brand-new graphics&quot; and it's coming to Nintendo Switch on November 17th.&nbsp;</p><p>The 1996 original was the very first Mario RPG. It tasks Mario, Bowser, Peach and friends with taking down a mechanical enemy named <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Smithy">Smithy</a> and recovering stolen pieces of the Star Road. The remake uses the same art style as modern Mario games. Although there's still some platforming involved, you'll need to engage in turn-based combat to overcome opponents.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="252aa2991cef417fb67ce742a7131fd5"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>That's not the only new version of an older game Nintendo announced during the Direct.

## Texas says state-funded EV charging stations need to include Tesla’s NACS connector

## Final Fantasy XVI review: A welcome dramatic turn for the series
 - [https://www.engadget.com/final-fantasy-xvi-review-ps5-140058789.html?src=rss](https://www.engadget.com/final-fantasy-xvi-review-ps5-140058789.html?src=rss)

<p>It’s back again. This time, it’s real-time. With <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>, the series’ creators have decided that the future of the franchise is action-centric and storyline driven. And it’s been inspired by epic fantasy series from television. Until now, the Final Fantasy games have never quite had their angry, moody dark moment. With nuanced, occasionally horny characters and often a lot of violence, is this the series’ moody teenager era?</p><p><em>FFXVI </em>is the first game in the series made for the PS5, expanding the detail of both character models and environments. While the significant characters move and emote realistically, Square Enix has kept an artistic touch to character design. The most impressive parts are the environments, with gorgeous forests, medieval fortresses and major landmarks towering over the usual fields and cliffs you’ll be exploring and fighting at. The quality isn't consistent enough in an era of games like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/horizon-forbidden-west-review-water-robot-dinos-080126554.html"><em>Horizon: Forbidden West</em></a><em>, Dead Space </em>and<em>&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/elden-ring-12-million-copies-18-days-105555964.html"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>, though. I noticed when character models and environments weren’t given the same attention as key scenes and chapters.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Unlike previous Final Fantasy games, while there’s still an ensemble cast, you’ll only ever control the protagonist <a href="https://www.engadget.com/final-fantasy-xvi-preview-demo-release-date-130020481.html">Clive</a> — yes, an interesting choice in hero name, one that even some in-game characters are... surprised by. You’ll eventually be able to offer simple commands to your faithful wolf, Torgal, and you’ll be joined by other companions that will fight entirely independently of you. These include your childhood friend Jill, the mysterious daddy of thunder, Cid, and several more spoiler(ish) additions.</p><p>Fortunately, and unlike an awful lot of non-playable battle allies in RPGs, they can usually attract the attention of a monster or two and even finish off enemies by themselves. Still, there’s no escaping the fact that it’s an even looser party battle dynamic than its predecessor <em>Final Fantasy XV,</em> let alone older titles.</p><p>The tale of <em>FFXVI</em> is achingly <em>Game Of Thrones</em>-y. It starts out as a battle of warring states, of religion versus monarchy, wars for the sake of controlling resources — or escaping inhospitable land. Sometimes the inspiration is a little on the nose: Dad dies early on? Check. Mysterious wolves? Check. Creepy mother-son relations? Check. However, the series has always drawn on pop-culture inspiration over the years: Dungeons and Dragons, Star Wars and Lord of the Rings have all been tugged at for monster names, storylines and more.</p><section><img alt="Final Fantasy XVI review" class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/355e2eb0-1010-11ee-bffb-d4e2656d5dae" style="height: 1350px; width: 2400px;" /></section><p>Within the opening hours, we meet Clive, his sickly (but ‘chosen’) younger brother Joshua and their childhood friend, Jill. Clive and Joshua’s mother, the Cersei-styled Anabella Rosfield, swiftly betrays her family and the entire nation. The leader, her husband, is slaughtered in front of Joshua, whose latent powers as a dominant fully awakened due to this trauma. Arguably even more harrowing, a chocobo (the game series’ giant bird mounts) gets bricked in the <em>head</em> and someone kills an <em>owl</em>. This all happens in the span of a couple of minutes.</p><p>In the form of the giant fire Eikon (elemental deity), Phoenix, Joshua burns enemies and allies alike to ash, and as Clive watches, horrified, he somehow unleashes a new, never-before-seen Eikon of his own, Ifrit, who has a surprisingly grisly encounter with Phoenix. Clive wakes up with no memory of this, however, while a foreboding figure in a hood watches all of this unfold, So yeah, the perfect pilot episode of a fantasy series on HBO. The superb voice acting and writing really helps sell the melodrama and seriousness of the story. For a series often criticized for cliche or awkward translations, this is all so much better. The voice actor for Cid is Ralph Ineson – who was even in<em> GoT. </em>Get ready for lots of Yorkshire accents: It’s time for all to learn what “ta-ra” means. Square Enix notes that, even if you pick the Japanese language setting, the game’s lip sync is set to the English version.</p><figure><img alt="Final Fantasy XVI review" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/5b621f70-101c-11ee-abf7-5e355e39c797" style="height: 1350px; width: 2400px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Square Enix</div></figure><p>If you haven’t played a Final Fantasy title before — and Square Enix is positioning this as an action game for that kind of player — Ifrit is usually a run-of-the-mill summonable demon. He’s rarely a crucial plot pivot, so it’s cool to see the series subvert expectations and pay tribute to the games of the past. There are lots of Easter eggs like this, both subtle and obvious.</p><p>The crystal theme, originally penned for the first Final Fantasy game on the Nintendo Entertainment System, is remixed and dropped in during multiple points of the game, while Cid (a character found in every FF game, either as a non-playable character or party member) has a daughter called Mid — a reference to the grandson of <em>Final Fantasy V</em>'s version of Cid.</p><p>While other games, including spin-offs and <em>Final Fantasy XV</em>, have touched on real-time combat, <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em> goes all in. It’s dangerous new territory for a series with some die-hard fans, but possibly a necessary move to attract a new audience.</p><p>But it’s not Devil May Fantasy. It doesn’t appear to be a particularly deep system on either the default or story-centric difficulties. I found myself leaning on abilities I knew could do sustained damage, doing well-timed dodges and countering.</p><p>There are layers to battles – but they’re easy to ignore. Mid-game skills like the ability to jump and then kick-off an enemy, or launch yourself into the air with a pull attack normally used to sling smaller enemies toward you, offer some more vertical approaches to combat. However, I rarely needed to figure this out during battles, and it was more about relentlessly attacking and paying attention to incoming attacks that enemies usually signposted. Clive will bolster his initial fire attacks, courtesy of Phoenix, with skills from other Eikons, adding new forms of attack or counters. If there’s some kind of elemental scissors-paper-rock dynamic, I didn’t notice it, or missed an explanation.</p><p>The major difference between action- and story-focus modes is the inclusion of several accessories that make <em>FFXVI</em> one of the most accessible (and forgiving) action RPGs I’ve ever played. You’ll start the game with a handful of accessories like the Ring of Timely Focus which slows down when an evadable attack approaches, giving you ample time to dodge. The Ring of Timely Strikes will unleash a barrage of complex attacks just by spamming the square button. I played with the Ring of Timely Focus occasionally equipped, helping me to hold my own in more difficult scenes filled with enemies, but tried to fight the bigger enemies (and bosses) with only my own skills. There is a new game plus mode that offers hardier enemies and challenges, but I haven’t had time to play it yet.</p><p>The bosses, while spectacular, have a tendency towards being damage sponges – especially the Eikon-on-Eikon fights that typically include three or more transitions in a single battle. Once you’ve figured out the timing of dodges to attacks, it’s often repeated to boredom. But hey, they always look cool. Some of these boss fights are.. incredibly epic – and I mean Bayonetta-level of ridiculous. There aren’t many boss battles in video games that reach the level of Clive’s duel against Bahamut…</p><p><em>Final Fantasy XVI </em>also has a wonderful hidden weapon: Its own built-in wiki. Active Time Lore, a play on active time battles from the series’ arguable heyday of the late-’90s, not only fills in the narrative gaps plaguing FF but plenty of other politically tilted RPGs.</p><p>Both <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-06-06-remastered-final-fantasy-xii-comes-to-ps4-in-2017.html"><em>FFXII</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-01-13-why-final-fantasy-xiii-just-didnt-work.html"><em>FFXIII</em></a> suffered from lots of fictional terminology and complicated back-story. With the latter, developers relegated anything close to a glossary to menus that were difficult to navigate and consequently rarely investigated.</p><figure><img alt="Final Fantasy XVI" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/fad0e270-1022-11ee-9f26-0f7e5f5fccb0" style="height: 1350px; width: 2400px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Square Enix</div></figure><p>Active Time Lore, which can be summoned from the touchpad during almost any scene or area, brings a convenient shortcut to that tip-of-the-tongue, which-warring-state-is-he-from-again quandary. It’s an elegant solution, inspired by Amazon Prime Video’s X-Ray feature. It also ensures gamers don’t come undone when there are so many political maneuverings, time skips, false deaths and hooded strangers.</p><p>All of this is augmented by Vivian, a character whose sole purpose appears to be educating Clive about the wider political implications of his fight to dismantle the political structure around huge magical crystals (by destroying them), dominants (by besting them, usually) and freeing indentured magic-wielding slaves. All while seeking vengeance for his brother.</p><p>Talking with her at your base of operations will open a handy personnel chart of all the main characters, their associates, and the rest. It also comes with a chronological slider, so you can guess who’ll betray who next. If you came undone during a season of Game of Thrones, you might understand why this could be needed.</p><figure><img alt="Final Fantasy XVI review" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/357475d0-1010-11ee-bfef-b33476296374" style="height: 1350px; width: 2400px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Square Enix</div></figure><p><em>Final Fantasy XVI </em>is different – perhaps due to the producer, Naoki Yoshida, who worked on the online MMORPG <em>Final Fantasy XIV </em>as both producer and director. But with<em> Final Fantasy VII Remak</em>e (including the next <a href="https://www.engadget.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-rebirth-is-delayed-to-early-2024-211301245.html">chapter</a>) offering the party battles I want, I don’t see a problem in Square Enix taking the series in this direction. I miss the party battle dynamics, but I didn’t feel hamstrung by my own mediocre action game reflexes or skills. If you are looking for challenging battles, the game comes with post-game content aimed at completionists and the muscular of thumb. But for those looking for a fantasy adventure with a plot that’s kept me hooked – so far – the sixteenth Final Fantasy delivers.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/final-fantasy-xvi-review-ps5-140058789.html?src=rss

## Nest WiFi Pro review: Google’s WiFi 6E mesh is more approachable than the rest

<p>Google’s pitch for its own mesh networking products has been to focus on clever trade-offs to keep the cost down, making it accessible to the masses. The <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Hb29nbGUtTmVzdC1XaUZpLVByby1SZWxpYWJsZS9kcC9CMEJDUVNZUFpCLz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby0xM3EtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImI5NDc0Y2MwLTExM2UtNDQ5OC05ODU3LWIyZWJiMzhjZDFiYSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAcOb-dye1godWoXyNBCaTCPnjGIyJHL1ZTUKppn0dLGJ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGoogle-Nest-WiFi-Pro-Reliable%2Fdp%2FB0BCQSYPZB%2F">Nest WiFi Pro</a>, the company’s latest flagship, builds upon that existing (and winning) formula with the addition of WiFi 6E. Part of its appeal is the Google brand, plus the promise of regular free software updates and tight integrations with most of the world’s smart home players. In a head-to-head race, the Nest WiFi Pro will be bested by plenty of its competitors, but Google’s user-friendliness means it’s the default option for pretty much everyone.</p><h2>Hardware</h2><p>As I said in our main mesh WiFi buyer’s guide, I’ve been using Google’s first-generation version for years, and also reviewed the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-07-google-nest-wifi-review.html">second-generation Nest WiFi</a>, so I feel like this is my turf. The Nest WiFi Pro is Google’s first to harness WiFi 6/6E, which was irritatingly omitted from the last model on cost grounds. Because of this, they can’t integrate with your existing Google / Nest WiFi hardware, meaning that any upgrade will require you to start fresh.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p></p><p>In terms of looks, the Pros are ovoid bumps that stand taller than their predecessors and demand more space. ‘Round back, you’ll find the jack for the barrel power cable and two ethernet ports which Google <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N0b3JlLmdvb2dsZS5jb20vZ2IvcHJvZHVjdC9uZXN0X3dpZmlfcHJvX3NwZWNzP2hsPWVuLUdCIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiOTQ3NGNjMC0xMTNlLTQ0OTgtOTg1Ny1iMmViYjM4Y2QxYmEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWM091X6ch4uP8cGZ1wh-fH9fPzyVL_jejqhzMoCzpsP&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.google.com%2Fgb%2Fproduct%2Fnest_wifi_pro_specs%3Fhl%3Den-GB">says</a> “support 1 Gbps wired speeds per router.” Inside, it packs a Cortex A35 dual-core 64-bit ARM CPU paired with 1GB of RAM and 4GB of storage like its predecessor. It is available in four colors: Snow, Linen, Fog and Lemongrass.</p><p>The Nest WiFi Pro doesn’t reserve a chunk of its spectrum for dedicated backhaul. Instead, it dynamically shunts traffic around the available space for optimal performance, which will primarily take place on the 6GHz band, since plenty of devices in our homes don’t have the components necessary to access it. <a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/12367191?hl=en">Google adds</a> that using 6GHz as backhaul frees up lots of space in the 2.4 and 5GHz bands, improving performance for all the other devices on the network.</p><p>One interesting tweak from the last model is that you can’t get the Pro with a built-in smart speaker. This is  good, since I never liked the idea of having a speaker inside my WiFi apparatus. But I will concede that I did like being able to use Spotify Connect on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-07-google-nest-wifi-review.html">original Nest WiFi</a> in my kitchen without buying another speaker.</p><h2>Installation</h2><p>Since it's a Google product, expect the Nest WiFi Pro to be relatively easy to install through your phone — for most of the process. If you, like me in this instance, already had a Google mesh in place, you'll need to factory reset, wipe and deactivate everything. Once done, you can just connect the first node to your modem with an ethernet cable (supplied) and let the app do the rest for you.</p><p>The Google Home app will almost instantly find the new product waiting to be installed and get you started. It took me ten minutes to get the first one running, and that included an unrelated issue with my cable modem that forced me to restart. It took another ten minutes to install the other nodes, but all I had to do was scan the QR code and follow the on-screen instructions.</p><p>The app doesn’t offer any advice about optimum node placement or identifying potential weak spots. Google’s website offers the stock line that you should put a node halfway between the primary and wherever in your home you need WiFi. That’s fine, but I suspect novice users might appreciate more guidance, especially if they’re struggling with structural issues that mean adjoining rooms aren’t getting a good signal.</p><h2>Performance</h2><figure><img alt="Image of three Nest WiFi Pro units, rear-on, in front of a blurred bookcase." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/e6473090-0c56-11ee-9ebf-ecd2c1872324" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Daniel Cooper / Engadget</div></figure><p>I don’t have many WiFi 6E-compatible devices at home, and there was a fair distance between the nearest node and my office, so I didn't have high hopes that switching to the new system would deliver great gains. Yet, compared to the WiFi module in my office, which is connected via Ethernet to my modem, I saw my speed jump from around 120 Mbps to an average of 240 Mbps.</p><p>The only place where the Nest WiFi Pro’s connection was anything other than eye-wateringly fast was in my notorious back bedroom. The room, surrounded by Victorian (and modern) plumbing, was previously barren territory for my older system, but it was now joined up here. And while speeds fell to 63 Mbps, I never saw a dropout or stutter in performance. In fact, WiFi performance in that room is more than sufficient to work and take video calls.</p><p>Despite the fewer modules, connectivity was stable and I never noticed a drop when I ran between rooms. Armed with all the devices I could muster, me and my kids scuttled around the house walking to the furthest points of the house watching plenty of streamed video, and none reported an issue. My average speed tests shook down to close to 250 Mbps, and the connection was smooth enough for my purposes.</p><h2>Additional features</h2><p>The Nest WiFi Pro supports Matter and Thread, so you can control your smart home from the Google Home app. When I opened the app after installing the new hardware, it asked if I wanted to connect to my Philips Hue and iRobot products. You’ll still need to have your Hue Bridge connected, however, so you’re not saving a plug on your Ethernet switch. That’s unfortunate compared to, say, some Eero models which have built-in Zigbee units that allow you to ditch the bridge entirely. But if you’re all-in on Google’s Assistant then you’ll  benefit from having everything hooked up inside one app.</p><p>A key selling point of Google’s network products is the promise to keep them up to date with software and security updates. The company has rolled out <a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/topic/6318633?sjid=3172454786104930652-EU">fairly regular updates</a> over the last seven years and there’s no indication yet that it’s going to stop. I’ve been fairly happy with the work done for my first-generation Google WiFi pucks. If I do have a concern, it’s that Google sometimes axes products not long after launch, so you do run the risk of investing in the company only for its impatience to get the better of it.</p><h2>App and controls</h2><p>I preferred when you could control your Google WiFi through the standalone app, but these days it’s all rolled into the company’s Home app. That’s great as a one-stop shop for any compatible smart home gadgets you might have, but it’s less comprehensive. When managing your network, you can look at per-device traffic, set priority access (or pause connection to) any device on the network. You’ll also be able to run speed and mesh connection tests to ensure that your network performance is optimal.</p><p>Some of these features aren’t standard on other routers, and some you need to pay extra to access. Others may offer you a good deal more, too. If you’re looking for more fine-grain control, you probably won’t find it on the Nest. As much as Google calls this a “Pro” router, it’s more to gesture toward being<em> more premium</em>, rather than for actual professionals. There’s no access to some of the harder-core settings or browser-based controls page for power users. Instead, this is a locked-down, curated experience for people who want their WiFi to work without much .</p><p>For parental controls, you can set up groups within the Family WiFi menu to pause multiple devices at once. You can also schedule access times, a feature that several other mesh products expect you to pay to use. And while there’s no specific way to filter individual websites, you can designate some hardware to be routed via Google’s SafeSearch to block a broad swathe of content online. What this system lacks is any fine-grain control for concerned parents or the ability to monitor a specific device’s browsing history. But I’ve always been of the opinion that overzealous parenting just creates kids who learn at a young age to hide what they’ve been up to.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>What Google’s WiFi products have always offered is a fairly acceptable blend of power, price and performance. You won’t be getting into the nitty-gritty parts of running a network, but you’re also not paying a huge amount of cash. It should appeal to people who really don’t want to worry about doing much more than running the odd speed test and quickly setting up a guest network without any stress. Something like the TP-Link XE75 might run faster and offer more features, but for this price, Google’s remained true to its ethos of making the right compromises.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/nest-wifi-pro-review-googles-wifi-6e-mesh-is-more-approachable-than-the-rest-130029818.html?src=rss

<p>Apple has <a href="https://podcasters.apple.com/5304-elevating-nine-podcast-subcategories-charts">updated</a> its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-iphone-cases-153035988.html">Podcasts app</a> on iOS, iPadOS and macOS with features that make it easier to find content in your favorite genres. It now includes nine new subcategories: Mental Health, Relationships, Self-Improvement, Personal Journals, Entrepreneurship, Documentary, Parenting, Books and Language learning. Those come on top of existing subcategories like True Crime, Sports and others.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-mental-health-condition-detection-iphone-report-171343401.html">focused on mental health</a> over the past few years, and recently introduced the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-ios-17-revamps-core-apps-172548767.html">Journal app</a> that lets you document how you're feeling. In addition, the company recently introduced a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/heres-everything-apple-announced-at-wwdc-2023-223303827.html">mood tracking feature</a> as part of Health in iOS 17. The addition of the Mental Health subcategory in Podcasts, along with others like Relationships, Self-Improvement and Personal Journals, appears to be part of that.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Apple Podcasts update makes it easier to find content in your favorite genres" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/b83f6fa0-102a-11ee-beb3-ed62d296c821" style="height: 655px; width: 1000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>Each subcategory has its own charts showing top shows and episodes in your particular market. &quot;For example, a listener in the U.S. can browse the charts for Mental Health, which display the top 200 shows and top 200 episodes available in the U.S. based on a mix of listening, follows, and completion rate,&quot; Apple wrote in its Podcasts for Creators blog.&nbsp;</p><p>As a point of comparison, Spotify has eight main podcast categories and no less than 54 subcategories. YouTube offers 14 main podcast categories and PocketCast 19, but neither offer subcategories. With the new additions, Apple appears to offer a good selection without overwhelming users.</p><p>The nine new subcategories, along with the 19 primary categories, have been updated with new artwork and recommendations as well. The latter includes New &amp; Noteworthy shows, Shows of the Month, Feature Channels and Creators and global Highlights.&nbsp;</p><p>With the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-ios-17-revamps-core-apps-172548767.html">upcoming release</a> of iOS 17, Apple <a href="https://podcasters.apple.com/5303-ios-17-whats-new-apple-podcasts">is adding</a> some new Podcasts features like a refreshed Now Play experience and Queue, episode art, search filters and more.

## Apple's union-busting practices violated employee rights at NYC store, judge rules

<p>Apple is once again in trouble for its union-busting practices. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) judge ruled Apple interfered with employees' organizing efforts at its World Trade Center store in New York City after workers, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-21/apple-illegally-interrogated-staff-about-union-judge-rules?leadSource=uverify%20wall"><em>Bloomberg </em>reported</a>. Managers were found to have taken away pro-union flyers in the break room and attempted to dissuade employees from joining unions, which prosecutors argued had led employees to end the organizing campaign. A <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/02-CA-295979">judge ordered Apple</a> &quot;cease and desist from coercively interrogating employees regarding their protected concerning activities and Union sympathies.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>The news broke in early 2022 that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-store-employee-union-plans-230050218.html">Apple store workers nationwide were quietly organizing</a> in response to concerns that their wages didn't reflect the rising cost of living. However, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-union-starbucks-cwa-cumberland-012024025.html">Apple soon hired the anti-union law firm Littler Mendelson</a>, which also represents Starbucks and McDonalds, among others. The company also instructed store managers to share anti-union sentiments, such as warning employees that joining a union could bring reduced pay, career opportunities and time off. That May, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-store-world-trade-center-union-busting-complaint-060937009.html">Communications Workers of America filed Unfair Labor Practice charges</a> for the Apple stores in the World Trade Center and Atlanta's Cumberland Mall.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Union efforts are slowly gaining ground at Apple stores across the country. The NLRB previously found Apple had violated federal law in Atlanta, including daily mandatory anti-union meetings for employees and interrogating workers. Last year, employees at an Apple store in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/second-apple-store-to-unionize-oklahoma-city-070056192.html">Maryland and another in Oklahoma voted to unionize</a>. Yet, other locations like the St. Louis branch abandoned plans to unionize, blaming similar tactics by Apple.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apples-union-busting-practices-violated-employee-rights-at-nyc-store-judge-rules-115036323.html?src=rss

<p>Amazon has announced the dates for its next annual shopping event. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-day-kicks-off-july-11th-this-year-050624779.html">Prime Day 2023</a> will be on July 11th and 12th this year, beginning at 12AM PT/ 3AM ET on Tuesday, July 11th, and concluding at the end of Wednesday, July 12th.</p><p>Prime Day isn’t necessarily a perk of Amazon’s subscription service, like access to Prime Video content, but most deals on Amazon during the two-day event are exclusively available to Prime members. The cost of Prime has increased quite a bit since its launch in 2005, and even in the past few years. An annual membership will set you back $139 right now, $20 more than its previous price. (Then again, maybe <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-is-reportedly-trying-to-offer-prime-subscribers-free-cell-phone-service-140026387.html">free phone service </a>could soon sweeten the deal?).</p><p>Prime Day is typically the best time of the year to get Amazon devices – I’m keeping an eye out for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-kindle-scribe-review-e-ink-reader-tablet-pen-drawing-price-battery-life-140019784.html">Kindle Scribe</a> – but we also expect to see worthwhile sales on headphones, robot vacuums, laptops, SSDs and much more.

We’ve already tested the S5 II but now we’re looking at what I think is the more interesting model, the S5 IIX. It has an identical design and many of the same features as its sibling, like the new autofocus system and highly effective in-body stabilization. However, it adds a key function: the ability to record high-quality, easy-to-edit ProRes video internally. The new autofocus is good but not quite up to the Sony A7 IV, and it lacks the full-frame 4K 60p video of the Canon R6 II, but it’s far better for video than both models, thanks to the ProRes option and other features not in either rival model. Engadget’s Steve Dent tests it out.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-s5-iix-review-power-and-value-in-one-vlogging-package-133058128.html"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/ai-generated-music-wont-win-a-grammy-anytime-soon-211855194.html%20https://www.engadget.com/...">AI-generated music won’t win a Grammy anytime soon</a></h2><h3>But human-written songs with some AI-generated elements might.</h3><h3></h3><p>The Recording Academy CEO, Harvey Mason Jr., said this week that although the organization will consider music with limited AI-generated voices or instrumentation for award recognition, it will only honor songs written and performed “mostly by a human.”</p><p>“At this point, we are going to allow AI music and content to be submitted, but the Grammys will only be allowed to go to human creators who have contributed creatively in the appropriate categories,” Mason said in an interview with Grammy.com.

## Twitch replaces its mature content mode with more granular 'labels'

<p>Twitch has overhauled its mature content policies, switching from a general toggle to specific categories describing what viewers can expect. The new <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2023/06/20/introducing-content-classification-labels/">Content Classification Labels</a> are mature-rated games, sexual themes, significant profanity or vulgarity, gambling, violent and graphic depictions and, lastly, drugs, intoxication or excessive tobacco use.</p><p>The ratings apply to both the game and you. For example, if you're playing a mature-rated game, Twitch will automatically label it as such. But, if you're playing an E-rated game and excessively swearing, you will need to mark your stream as having significant profanity or vulgarity. In general, it's pretty obvious when to use a label based on their names, but Twitch's <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Content-Classification-Guidelines?language=en_US">Content Classification Guidelines</a> break down when to use each one in incredible detail (from pose examples to categorizing swear words). The rules around what's not allowed on streams have stayed the same.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You can access Content Classification Labels in the Stream Manager's &quot;Edit Stream Info&quot; section below the language control. A pull-down menu will show the six options with a short description following each. All you need to do is click whichever applies to your current stream and, if it changes, add or remove them as you go.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="A pull down shows different labels to choose for the Twitch stream. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/68b1ada0-1010-11ee-9fbd-adecca143bdf" style="height: 576px; width: 831px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Twitch</div></figure><p>Keep in mind that whatever labels remain checked when you end a stream will be automatically applied to your next one unless you unclick them. You can <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-reporting-and-appeals-tools-181800017.html">report users to Twitch</a> (and vice versa) for not including required labels, and if Twitch agrees, they will issue a warning.</p><p>While these new Content Classification Labels are already available to use, Twitch is giving everyone an adjustment period of sorts. You can still get warnings, but Twitch will only start tallying them after July 20. At that point, &quot;repeated warnings&quot; will likely still not get you suspended with Twitch, instead opting to lock certain classifications onto your account for a set amount of days or weeks.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/twitch-replaces-its-mature-content-mode-with-more-granular-labels-100501056.html?src=rss

## Instagram finally lets users download Reels

<p>TikTok has enjoyed a significant advantage over Instagram Reels in that anyone can download a TikTok video and post it to another social media network — something that helps draw new users to the platform. Now, Instagram has finally gained that ability, according to a post by CEO Adam Mosseri (using the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-is-rolling-out-its-telegram-like-broadcast-channels-worldwide-160815133.html">new broadcast channels</a> feature) spotted by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/20/instagram-now-finally-allows-users-to-download-public-reels/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The feature is only available to US users on mobile for now, and only for public and not private accounts. At the same time, users with public accounts can choose a setting that blocks users from downloading their Reels. To use the feature, you tap on the &quot;Share&quot; icon for a given Reel and select &quot;Download.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Instagram now lets users download Reels to their smartphones" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/cda6b5c0-1010-11ee-bfb5-4782b8f3923b" style="height: 1276px; width: 1312px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>An image posted by Mosseri (top) appears to show that downloaded Reels will be watermarked with the Instagram logo and name of the account, much as TikTok does. YouTube also started <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-watermarking-shorts-videos-080310791.html">adding watermarks</a> to Shorts videos created on desktop, likely also as a way to bring attention to its short video feature.&nbsp;</p><p>Instagram now appears to be taking the same tack, likely also seeing it as a way to ensure people see Reels on other social media networks. It's not going out of its way to accommodate videos from rival platforms, though. The Meta-owned company allows TikTok and other videos to be uploaded, but its algorithms <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-reels-repost-tiktoks-best-practices-200536658.html">stopped promoting</a> any watermarked videos from rivals back in 2021.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/instagram-finally-lets-users-download-reels-093425845.html?src=rss

## Popular subreddits welcomed porn content to protest Reddit's API changes

<p>While most subreddits <a href="https://www.engadget.com/popular-subreddits-plan-to-extend-blackouts-indefinitely-205005565.html">that went dark</a> to oppose the website's API changes are now live and active again, some moderators aren't done protesting the changes on the platform. As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/20/23767098/reddit-subreddits-porn-protest"><em>The Verge</em></a> reports, several popular subreddits that historically prohibited porn have started allowing users to post NSFW or Not Safe For Work content. These communities include r/interestingasfuck, r/TIHI (Thanks, I Hate It), r/mildlyinteresting and r/videos.&nbsp;</p><p>In r/TIHI's case, for instance, a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TIHI/comments/14cghn3/welcome_back/">stickied post</a> says the subreddit is removing a rule that forbids extreme NSFW content and will now welcome them, as long as they're legal under US law. A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/14c0vcf/rinterestingasfuck_will_be_reopening_monday_june/">similar post</a> on r/interestingasfuck lists a smaller and less restrictive set of new rules, including labeling whether a post is NSFW or not and prohibiting sexual content with minors. By allowing their subreddits to be filled with posts deemed not safe for work, the moderators have made sure that Reddit can't monetize them. NSFW subreddits haven't been eligible <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditforBusiness/comments/bdwlin/update_to_nsfw_advertising_policy/">for ad targeting in years</a>, and the website doesn't allow ads for adult-oriented products, as well.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Reddit's response to the situation has been swift — administrators have reportedly removed whole moderating teams for communities that have labeled themselves NSFW. If you take a look at the r/interestingasfuck and r/TIHI subreddits, you'll see that their moderator boxes are empty, save for a note that says &quot;This subreddit is unmoderated. Visit r/redditrequest to request it.&quot; Reddit spokesperson Tim Rathschmidt told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/20/23767848/reddit-blackout-api-protest-moderators-suspended-nsfw"><em>The Verge</em></a>: &quot;Moderators incorrectly marking a community as NSFW is a violation of both our Content Policy and Moderator Code of Conduct.&quot;</p><p>The other subreddits mentioned now have a full moderating team and no longer have explicit posts. It's unclear whether the mods themselves decided to go back to regular programming or whether they were forced to do so. Several r/mildlyinteresting moderators told the publication that while it's true they were locked out of their subreddits by a Reddit admin, they were reinstated by a different administrator. Said admin reversed the seven-day suspension they got, as well.</p><p>All these events stemmed from Reddit's decision to start charging access to its API. Reddit was originally targeting companies scraping the website for content used to train Large Language Models for generative AI, but its decision also affects thousands of third-party clients and apps that tie into the platform, including ones with moderation tools. Thousands of communities protested the move by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/reddit-sees-more-than-6000-communities-go-dark-in-protest-over-api-changes-095311637.html">setting their subreddits</a> private and making them inaccessible.&nbsp;</p><p>Reddit CEO Steve Huffman, however, was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-reddit-blackout-is-already-forcing-unexpected-changes-103521266.html">unmoved</a> by the protest and told the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/06/15/1182457366/reddit-ceo-steve-huffman-its-time-we-grow-up-and-behave-like-an-adult-company?refresh=true"><em>NPR</em></a>: &quot;It's a small group that's very upset, and there's no way around that. We made a business decision that upset them.&quot; He also told <em>NBC News </em>that he plans to allow ordinary users to vote moderators out more easily based on their decisions. A company representative <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/14bwfai/moderators_voice_concerns_over_reddits/">echoed</a> that sentiment in a post on the website and added: &quot;If a moderator team unanimously decides to stop moderating, we will invite new, active moderators to keep these spaces open and accessible to users&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/popular-subreddits-welcomed-porn-content-to-protest-reddits-api-changes-061033337.html?src=rss

## Amazon Prime Day kicks off July 11th this year

<p>Amazon has officially <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-prime-day-2023-date">announced</a> the dates for its next annual shopping event. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-day-2023-124519231.html">Prime Day 2023</a> will be on July 11th and 12th this year — the event will begin at 12AM PT/3AM ET on Tuesday, July 11th, and conclude at the end of the day on Wednesday, July 12th. As it has been for the past few years, Prime Day will be a two-day event during which Prime members can snag deals on everything from electronics to fashion to Amazon's own devices.</p><p>The past couple of years saw Prime Day in different seasons, mostly due to COVID-19 repercussions. In 2020, Amazon had to delay Prime Day until October, and it rebounded a bit in 2021 by having Prime Day in June. Last year, Amazon fully returned to its roots by having its main shopping event in July, although it did add a second Prime Day in October in the lead-up to the holiday shopping season.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Aside from drumming up a large number of sales in a short period of time, Prime Day has always been a way for Amazon to increase the numbers of subscribers it has for its <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9hbWF6b25wcmltZT90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby0xM24tMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImU4YTcwMWZhLTdmMzEtNDZhOS1iMWQxLTkwYTg2OTEyMTY3NSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAeDJVgLoQQ27rcgNN6Myb4cVZjr_nu3KxWAL8XPyznIY&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Famazonprime">subscription service</a>. Prime Day isn’t necessarily a perk of Prime like access to Prime Video content or free two-day shipping are, but it certainly helps that most deals you’ll find on Amazon during the two-day event are exclusively available to Prime members. However, that doesn’t change the fact that the cost of Prime has increased quite a bit since its launch in 2005, and even within the past few years. An annual membership will set you back $139 right now, $20 more than its previous price.</p><p>If you do plan on putting that Prime membership to use next month, you can turn to Engadget to find the tech deals worth your month during the two-day event. Unsurprisingly, Amazon Prime Day is one of the best times of the year to get Amazon devices, since most of them will likely be down to all-time-low prices. But we also expect to see worthwhile sales on headphones, robot vacuums, laptops, SSDs and much more.
