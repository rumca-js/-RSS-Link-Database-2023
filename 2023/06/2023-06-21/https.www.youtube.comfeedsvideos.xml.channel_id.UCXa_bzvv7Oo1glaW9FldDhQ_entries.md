Sonic Origins Plus, which bundles the base Sonic Origins offerings with 12 additional Game Gear titles and additional character select options, might be a homerun for longtime Sonic fans. However, the average gaming fan will find that the Game Gear offerings in this update are lackluster and better left in the past. 

Without any modernization efforts, these titles were either poorly conceived or didn’t age remarkably well. Still, the four core remastered titles at the center of Sonic Origins Plus are worth the price of admission for this package if you hadn’t previously acquired the Sonic Origins base game. With speedy, platforming action, vibrant pixelated art, and mesmerizing level design, there’s plenty to love with the Anniversary editions of Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Sonic CD.
