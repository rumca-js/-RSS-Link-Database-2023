Gamers living in select European countries, the U.K., Canada, and Australia can expect to pay a little more for brand-new Xbox Series X consoles, while the U.S. is (so far) spared from the hike. Monthly Game Pass Ultimate subs are going up by about $2 in the U.S., and comparable increases every where else. PC Game Pass, however, is staying the same price. In Nintendo news, the Big N just had their latest Nintendo Direct, showcasing a new 2D Super Mario Bros. game, a remake of the classic SNES title Super Mario RPG, a new Princess Peach game, and a few more. Most of these games are scheduled for release this year, and it feels like, in a post-Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom world, this is the congratulatory victory lap the Nintendo Switch needs to close out this generation. Nintendo does have one more major event this year, so maybe we'll hear something\u2014anything\u2014about their next major console.\n\n#IGN #Gaming", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6hvDNL60n0", "date_published": "2023-06-21 22:38:05+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Trepang2 - Official Launch Trailer", "description": "Trepang2 is available now on PC, and coming later in 2023 to Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5.
