## Microsoft Outlook: Hereâ€™s a workaround for slow startups

<p>If you&rsquo;re a Microsoft 365 subscriber experiencing Outlook freezes at startup, there&rsquo;s some good news on the way&mdash;Microsoft&rsquo;s not only aware of the issue and working on a fix, but it has a workaround to try, too.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-shares-workaround-for-outlook-freezes-slow-starts/&amp;xcust=2-1-1963598-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Bleeping Computer reports</a>, this problem affects Microsoft 365 users who sync their Outlook data files between their local PC and the cloud. When starting the app, it may act slow or even outright freeze; in airplane mode, you might also see an error message of &ldquo;<em>Cannot start Microsoft Outlook. Cannot open the Outlook window. The set of folders cannot be opened. The attempt to log on to Microsoft Exchange has failed</em>&rdquo; when trying to open the program.</p>



<p>Some users have been able to get into Outlook by quitting the misbehaving app and then opening it again, but Microsoft is currently suggesting a better workaround via Outlook&rsquo;s Account Settings. In the Exchange Account settings, choose <em>More Settings &gt; Advanced</em>, then check the box for <em>Turn on shared calendar improvements.</em> (Having trouble finding that option? You can read the more detailed instructions in <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/outlook-starts-up-slowly-and-hangs-at-splash-screen-when-rest-to-mapi-is-unexpectedly-toggled-c155c379-5ba5-4067-9d0a-5c3b7d603702#:~:text=Another%20solution%20is%20to%20explicitly%20specify%20the%20REST%20state%20in%20the%20Outlook%20account%20settings.%20This%20is%20done%20by%20toggling%20%22Shared%20Calendar%20Improvements%22%20off%20and%20on%3A&amp;xcust=2-1-1963598-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Microsoft&rsquo;s support page on the issue</a>.)</p>



<p>Microsoft says this startup problem is caused by a conflict in the app, where it&rsquo;s unable to determine the default state of the cache, due to Office and non-Office MAPI apps making different calls on that status. The program then acts unresponsive or stall out. When new profiles are created, or the setting for shared calendar improvements is turned off, it can trigger this scenario.</p>



<p>In other news about Outlook, Microsoft recently announced that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1961053/email-and-calendar-replaced-by-new-outlook-in-windows-11.html">it will completely replace</a> Windows 11&rsquo;s native Mail and Calendar apps by the end of 2024. In its post detailing the transition, new PCs shipping with Windows 11 will reflect the switch beginning in early 2024. Access to the Mail and Calendar applications will remain available in the Microsoft Store app through 2024.</p>

<p>Black Friday. President&rsquo;s Day. Labor Day. All of these arbitrary holiday designations for retail sales were not enough for the corporate juggernaut that is Amazon. No, nothing would suffice for Bezos&rsquo; baby, so he had to invent an entirely new holiday, more bombastic and arbitrary than any that came before: Prime Day. (And also it&rsquo;s more than one day, just because Jeff loves torturing web writers like yours truly). Alright, let&rsquo;s stop beating around the bush: it&rsquo;s July 11th and 12th. </p>



<h2 id="what-is-amazon-prime-day">What is Amazon Prime Day?</h2>



<p>Prime Day is Amazon&rsquo;s designated sale day, in addition to, well, all the other sales the site has throughout the year. As usual, Amazon will have discounts on literally tens of thousands of items all across its vast retail imperium, from carpet cleaners to CPUs.</p>



<h2 id="when-is-amazon-prime-day-2023">When is Amazon Prime Day 2023? </h2>



<p>July 11th and 12th. And Prime Day isn&rsquo;t reserved for Americans. According to Amazon, the July 11th and 12th sale will extend to 24 countries:</p>



<ul><li>Australia</li><li>Austria</li><li>Belgium</li><li>Brazil</li><li>Canada</li><li>China</li><li>Egypt</li><li>France</li><li>Germany</li><li>Italy</li><li>Japan</li><li>Luxembourg</li><li>Mexico</li><li>Netherlands</li><li>Poland</li><li>Portugal</li><li>Saudi Arabia</li><li>Singapore</li><li>Spain</li><li>Sweden</li><li>Turkey</li><li>United Arab Emirates</li><li>United States</li><li>United Kingdom</li></ul>



<p>India will get its own Prime Day sometime later this year. </p>



<h2 id="what-time-does-prime-day-2023-start">What time does Prime Day 2023 start?</h2>



<p>Prime Day deals will begin appearing at 3 A.M. Eastern Daylight Time in the US. It should begin at similar times in other counties, sometime in the wee hours of the morning. </p>

<p>As usual, Amazon will have discounts on literally tens of thousands of items all across its vast retail imperium, from carpet cleaners to CPUs. Some of the electronics brands Amazon is already highlighting include Anker and Waze, but some of the most dramatic discounts are usually saved for Amazon&rsquo;s own crop of Fire tablets, Kindle e-readers, and Echo smarthome devices. Amazon&rsquo;s press release says there will also be discounts on Amazon Prime Video movie and TV purchases, streaming Amazon Music deals, and celebrity and influencer picks. </p>



<p>While deals will be available site-wide as third-party sellers look to get in on the action, the deepest discounts will be reserved for Amazon Prime subscribers. (Naturally. I mean, it&rsquo;s in the name). Prime members will be able to sign up for invite-only deals, personalized alerts via email, the Amazon shopping app, or Alexa-compatible devices.</p>

<p>Amazon is so eager for you to spend money on Prime Day that it&rsquo;s pushing some of the deals forward for weeks and weeks. At <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/primeday&amp;xcust=2-1-1963008-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Amazon.com/primeday</a>, you can see some of the biggest discounts that will be available on Prime Day itself and sign up to receive alerts. Note that some of the deals, like this insane 43-inch Amazon Fire HDTV for <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08T6DZ81T/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=B08T6DZ81T&amp;pd_rd_w=1H4oc&amp;content-id=amzn1.sym.11cc0bc0-b794-4619-98b2-660efa994dec&amp;pf_rd_p=11cc0bc0-b794-4619-98b2-660efa994dec&amp;pf_rd_r=S7EJH6QZCS1JCM4S835H&amp;pd_rd_wg=QXFNe&amp;pd_rd_r=fdb54949-b530-45d0-a11c-231eb76213d0&amp;xcust=2-1-1963008-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">just a hundred bucks</a>, require you to click on &ldquo;request invite&rdquo; before the deal starts in order to get access to limited quantities. </p>



<h2 id="when-does-prime-day-2023-end">When does Prime Day 2023 end?</h2>



<p>Prime Day ends at the end of the day on July 12th, based on your local clock. Third-party sellers may have discounts up for a few hours or days after, but once Amazon&rsquo;s primary listings stop showing discounts, the party&rsquo;s over. </p>

## How to resize Windows 11â€™s taskbar
 - [https://www.pcworld.com/article/1961282/how-to-resize-the-taskbar.html](https://www.pcworld.com/article/1961282/how-to-resize-the-taskbar.html)

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>Remember the good old days when you could resize the Windows taskbar by simply grabbing it with your mouse and dragging it to the desired position? That option is completely removed in Windows 11, along with a number of other useful taskbar features. You can&rsquo;t move the taskbar to the sides of the screen either, for example.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s hard to understand why Microsoft chose to remove truly useful features that users have become accustomed to over the years. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/549576/the-windows-11-taskbar-is-an-annoying-step-backward.html">The Windows 11 taskbar is an annoying step backwards</a>. </p>



<p>But if you miss having a narrower or wider taskbar, it&rsquo;s actually possible to adjust the size of the taskbar in Windows 11 as well. But you have to use the registry editor and that&mdash;as the backbone of Windows&mdash;has the potential to go wrong.</p>



<p>So our standard warning applies: Editing your Windows registry isn&rsquo;t difficult, especially this small change. But there are always risks when tinkering with the registry, so if you&rsquo;re not fully comfortable doing so, don&rsquo;t do it. And just in case, back up the registry before making any changes. Let&rsquo;s get to it!</p>



<h2 id="1-the-registry">1. The registry</h2>



<p>Start the Registry Editor by clicking the Start button, typing <strong><em>regedit </em></strong>and pressing <strong><em>Enter</em></strong>.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Win11 registry editor" class="wp-image-1961343" height="631" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/registry-editor-win11.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<h2 id="2-key">2. Key</h2>



<p>In the registry editor, browse your way to the key (folder) <strong><em>HKEY_CURRENT_USER \ Software \ Microsoft \ Windows \ CurrentVersion \ Explorer \ Advanced</em></strong>.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Windows 11" class="wp-image-1946221" height="617" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/steg-for-steg-02.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Foundry</p></div>



<h2 id="3-dword">3. Dword</h2>



<p>Right-click on <strong><em>Advanced </em></strong>and select <strong><em>New</em></strong>, and <strong><em>32-bit value (DWORD)</em></strong>. Name the new value <strong><em>TaskbarSi</em></strong>.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Windows 11" class="wp-image-1946224" height="617" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/steg-for-steg-03.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Foundry</p></div>



<h2 id="4-value">4. Value</h2>



<p>Double click on your new value and set it to <strong><em>0 </em></strong>for minimum, <strong><em>1 </em></strong>for default and <strong><em>2 </em></strong>for largest size. Restart Windows 11 and your taskbar will be the new size you selected.</p>

## Windows may soon have fewer folder options in File Explorer

<p>When&rsquo;s the last time you used File Explorer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Display file icon on thumbnails&rdquo; option? How about the Sharing wizard? If the answer is &ldquo;never,&rdquo; you&rsquo;re not alone. Microsoft has taken some usage data and decided to trim down the Folder Options in File Explorer for Windows 11. The curtailed options are coming in build 23481, currently in the Insider Preview Build. But if you&rsquo;re especially attached to any of them, you&rsquo;ll be able to bring them back with some registry tweaks. </p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/06/14/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-23481/&amp;xcust=2-1-1962876-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Windows Insider Blog</a> (spotted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.tomshardware.com/news/microsoft-to-remove-multiple-folder-options-from-file-explorer&amp;xcust=2-1-1962876-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Tom&rsquo;s Hardware</a>), the Folder Options settings being removed are as follows: </p>



<ul><li>Hide Folder Merge conflict.</li><li>Always show icons, never thumbnails.</li><li>Display file icon on thumbnails.</li><li>Display file type information on Folder tips.</li><li>Hide protected OS files.</li><li>Show drive letters.</li><li>Show popup description for Folder and Desktop items.</li><li>Show encrypted or compressed NTFS files in color.</li><li>Use sharing wizard.</li></ul>



<p>Exactly how infrequently these settings are used wasn&rsquo;t shared by Microsoft.</p>



<p>As a general principle, new operating systems (or the forever update model Microsoft seems half-committed to) should offer more options rather than fewer. One of my most simple measurements for improvement from version to version is being able to do away with third-party tools I had previously relied on because they&rsquo;re now baked into the OS. Requiring a dive into the Registry Editor to re-enable an option you previously relied upon, even if you&rsquo;re in a minority of users, seems counter to that kind of improvement. </p>



<p>That said, these changes aren&rsquo;t set in stone. The Insider Preview Build is used to test precisely this kind of minutia, and the power users that provide feedback via that channel are exactly the kind of people who might object to some or all of these changes. We&rsquo;ll see if they make it into final builds later this year. Or perhaps we <em>won&rsquo;t </em>see if Microsoft&rsquo;s evaluation of how infrequently these options are actually used is accurate. </p>

<p>One of the very first mechanical keyboards that I bought was from Varmilo, a Chinese brand focused on simple designs with solid components. Solid enough, in fact, that I still use that board on a regular basis, even after modifying it several times. So I was excited to check out one of the company&rsquo;s latest models in a more official capacity, seeing how Varmilo had improved in the last few years.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Further reading:</strong> See our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406235/best-gaming-keyboard.html">best gaming keyboards</a> to learn about competing products.</p></blockquote>



<h2 id="the-varmilo-minilo-vxb67-design">The Varmilo Minilo VXB67 design</h2>



<p>The Minilo VXB67 is a gorgeous little board, mixing subtle hues with high-quality plastic and understated lighting into an appealing whole. It&rsquo;s also sticking with those high-quality components, with a compact but high-quality plastic body and completely custom electro-capacitive switches (more on those later).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The low point of the design is its confusing function key layout, which is exacerbated by an inability to reprogram any keys at all. This gives the Minilo a steep learning curve even compared to other compact keyboards, and it insists that you adapt to it instead of the other way around. But if you can forgive this quirk, and you&rsquo;re not looking for easy customization, it&rsquo;s a high-quality offering with some unique appeal in a sea of samey gaming and typing boards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Compared to more utilitarian designs, like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/812395/logitech-mx-mechanical-keyboard-review-2.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Logitech&rsquo;s MX Keys Mechanical</a> or even <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/823922/keychron-q5-mechanical-keyboard-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Keychron&rsquo;s Q</a> series, or the bombastic disco light show of gaming keyboards, the Minilo is pleasantly understated. The plastic case has a double-layered effect, with an eggshell-colored exterior and a layer of minty green directly surrounding the keys. These colors are continued into the keycaps themselves, accented by a splash of blue on the modifier keys. I think it would look great next to that new <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1937288/best-of-computex-2023-the-most-intriguing-and-innovative-pc-hardware.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Fractal Design Terra case</a> from Computex. If you&rsquo;re not a fan of this particular &ldquo;Eucalyptus&rdquo; combination, there&rsquo;s a pink-themed &ldquo;Mendozae&rdquo; option available as well.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>The Minilo is a high-quality offering with some unique appeal in a sea of samey gaming and typing boards.</p></blockquote></figure>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Varmilo Minilo VXB67 hero shot from the front" class="wp-image-1948408" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DSC03810.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>



<p>The good looks extend to the rest of the board. Note the logo on the bottom right, which lights up (and can be disabled if you please), and the matching green bottom plate with its engraved metal badge giving you all the manufacturer and model details. There&rsquo;s a lot of careful and very appealing work put into this board, as you might expect from a manufacturer that focuses so closely on its colorful special editions. Double-stage keyboard feet are a nice surprise, ABS keycaps (instead of the more premium PBT) slightly less so.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The layout is a variation of the popular 65% semi-standard, though I found a couple of the choices to be odd. The Delete key is just above the arrow cluster, instead of in the upper-right corner as in most similar designs. Some of the function layer layout is strange, too: F-keys along the top are obvious enough, but who looks for the Print Screen key on L, or media keys from T to P? More complex hardware functions, like controlling the lighting or pairing via Bluetooth, require a dive into the user manual.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Varmilo Minilo VXB67 rear" class="wp-image-1948412" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DSC03887.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>



<p>For example, the board has no power switch. It&rsquo;ll auto-sleep after 30 minutes, and re-awaken with a double-tap of the space bar. To turn off the white LEDs, you press Fn+X. To pair a new Bluetooth device or switch between existing paired devices, press Fn+Q, W, or E&hellip; which will flash a light on 1, 2, or 3, despite the fact that these keys aren&rsquo;t the ones you&rsquo;re pressing. To switch the top row from the default numbers to the function row, press Fn+Page Down. None of these operations are indicated on the keycaps themselves.&nbsp;Oh, and there&rsquo;s no manual in the box: You have to search for it on Varmilo&rsquo;s support site, adding yet another bit of frustration to all this. </p>



<p>Perhaps worse, there&rsquo;s no way to change any of these pre-programmed functions. That&rsquo;s a definite ding against the design in 2023. Budget boards like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1801607/g-skill-km250-keyboard-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">the excellent G.Skill KM250</a> can get away with that, but Varmilo can&rsquo;t, especially on a compact board where a comfortable and intuitive layout is crucial for usability. This is the biggest drawback of an otherwise excellent product.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="what-about-the-varmilo-minilo-vxb67-switches">What about the Varmilo Minilo VXB67 switches?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>This board comes with switches designed exclusively by and for Varmilo. That&rsquo;s not exactly uncommon these days &mdash; half the gaming keyboards seem to have &ldquo;custom&rdquo; switches, which generally means a company like Kailh or Gateron made them, possibly with a little extra design work, possibly not, and re-branded the outer casings. That&rsquo;s not the case here: The &ldquo;Jasmine&rdquo; switches on our review unit are electro-capacitive, and fairly unique for it.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Varmilo Minilo VXB67 hero Jasmine switches" class="wp-image-1948413" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DSC03655.jpg?quality=100&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>



<p>&ldquo;Electro-capacitive&rdquo; used to refer to a design that used a sliding stem as well as a rubber dome between the switches and the circuit board registering key presses, resulting in a distinctive &ldquo;thock&rdquo; feel that made the Happy Hacking keyboards popular. That isn&rsquo;t what Varmilo&rsquo;s electro-capacitive switches do. There&rsquo;s no sheet of rubber domes, each switch is entirely contained in its own Cherry MX-style housing.&nbsp;What the electro-capacitive term refers to is the stem and leaf design, which does not require direct contact like a typical MX-style switch, actuating the press by mere proximity instead of the usual &ldquo;click.&rdquo; This means that from the top of a keypress to the bottom, the only resistance you feel comes from the stem sliding along the switch housing and the spring itself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If all that seems like Greek to you, here&rsquo;s the TLDR version: The EC V2 switches in this board are <em>very </em>smooth. The &ldquo;Jasmine&rdquo; variant of the switch isn&rsquo;t just color-coded to match the keyboard, it&rsquo;s also a speedy linear design, so they&rsquo;re slightly lighter than most switches with a faster activation. If you like to type lightly without bottoming out (pressing down until you can&rsquo;t anymore), you&rsquo;ll be particularly pleased with these switches.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Varmilo Minilo VXB67 from the side" class="wp-image-1948410" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DSC03913.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>



<p>And that&rsquo;s a very good thing, since you don&rsquo;t have any other choices. While most keyboards in this price range come with hot-swap switch sockets that let you customize the switches, Varmilo omits the feature on the Minilo. That&rsquo;s not out of any kind of stinginess: The unique properties of these EC switches make them incompatible with other MX-style switch designs, even if they look very similar. If that extra flexibility is important to you, there&rsquo;s another slightly more expensive model of the Minilo with standard MX switches, hot-swap sockets, RGB lighting, and a 2.4GHz wireless dongle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But again, even with the limitations, these switches are <em>very </em>good. Smooth and quiet thanks to boxy stems, an all-plastic body, and a bit of silicone between the plate and the PCB, this board was surprisingly low-volume in an empty coffee shop even without switches with &ldquo;silent&rdquo; properties. It&rsquo;s a shame that ordering the EC V2 switches or the hot-swap sockets are an either-or proposition.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="how-does-the-varmilo-minilo-vxb67-compare-to-the-competition">How does the Varmilo Minilo VXB67 compare to the competition?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Varmilo asks a little less than $110 for the Minilo VXB67 on its website, with a choice of several electro-capacitive switch variants. It&rsquo;s about $5 more if you go for the model with standard MX switches and hot-swap sockets, which also lets you connect via a wireless USB dongle in addition to Bluetooth and upgrades the lights to RGB.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Varmilo Minilo VXB67 from the front" class="wp-image-1948411" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DSC03930.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>



<p>However, postage to the U.S. makes the price shoot up considerably &mdash; around $150 total for me. Buying from third-party vendors on Amazon or the MechanicalKeyboards.com specialty store brings the price back down to the $110-130 range, depending on your switch choices.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Do you want a very pretty keyboard with zero programming options, or a board that&rsquo;s less eye-catching and more customizable?</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>That puts the Minilo in the midrange category for mechanical boards, competing with wireless non-gaming designs like the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09MNBP7YP/&amp;xcust=2-2-1948170-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Keychron K6 Pro</a>. In that context, the question becomes clear: Do you want a very pretty, very high-quality keyboard with essentially zero customization options (including programming), or a board that&rsquo;s less eye-catching but allows you to customize to your heart&rsquo;s content?&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Varmilo Minilo VXB67 with cable and puller" class="wp-image-1948409" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DSC03973.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>



<p>I can&rsquo;t answer that question for you. But I can say that there&rsquo;s no reason for Varmilo to omit programming options, even if the electro-capacitive switches take hot-swapping off the table. You&rsquo;ll have to learn this board, not make it conform to your user style. It&rsquo;s an oversight that&rsquo;s hard to forgive when every other board in this price range offers at least some kind of programming option &mdash; even Logitech.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you can get over that limitation, the Varmilo Minilo VXB67 is an excellent little board that&rsquo;s equally comfy on your desktop or in your laptop bag. Just don&rsquo;t expect it to be especially accommodating.&nbsp;</p>

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>In some categories of computer software, there are scant free options and spending a few bucks on paid software makes a big difference. In other categories, paying for software is not necessary. Video editing is one such example. In fact, one program widely used in Hollywood is free, and there are several other decent programs for Windows users&mdash;including the utterly fantastic DaVinci Resolve. Windows even has a built-in program now that Microsoft is the owner of the simple video editor Clipchamp.</p>



<p>In addition to introducing you to some of the best free video editing options, we&rsquo;ll point you to websites where you can download free video clips, sound effects, music, and more to use in your films.</p>



<p><em>This article was translated from Swedish to English, and originally appeared on pcforalla.se</em>.</p>



<h2 class="toc" id="microsoft-clipchamp">Microsoft Clipchamp: Built-in and simple</h2>



<p>In 2021, Microsoft bought the simple, web-based video editor Clipchamp and it&rsquo;s now a built-in application in Windows 11. In its basic version, Clipchamp is free for everyone, but if you want more features, you&rsquo;ll need a subscription. Luckily, it&rsquo;s included in the Microsoft 365 subscription, so if you&rsquo;re already subscribed to the Office programs, you&rsquo;ll also get Clipchamp&rsquo;s extra features.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Clipchamp has a simple interface with a timeline where you can place clips that you then trim and cut to create a film. Simply drag from the left or right edge of a clip in the timeline to trim. Move the time marker and click the scissors icon to the left above the timeline to split the clip into two parts that you can work on separately. To cut off a piece in the center of a clip, divide it into three parts. Then select the center section and click the the trash-can icon next to the scissors icon, or press the backspace key. Then move the following part back to close the gap.</p>



<p>You can separate audio and video for more advanced clips, and add transitions, text, still images, sound effects, and music. If you&rsquo;ve been using Apple&rsquo;s iMovie on the iPhone or iPad, for example, you&rsquo;ll quickly adapt to Clipchamp.</p>



<p>One problem you&rsquo;ll encounter if you capture video with an iPhone or newer Android phone is that the files you import are probably in HEVC format, which is not supported by Clipchamp. The program will convert these to H264 format on import, but it can take a while if the films are large and numerous.</p>



<p>For a much deeper dive into its capabilities, check out our tutorial on <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/708192/how-to-use-clipchamp-microsofts-video-editor.html">how to use Clipchamp, Microsoft&rsquo;s sleeper-hit video editor</a>.</p>



<h2 class="toc" id="Davinci-Resolve">Davinci Resolve: The giant</h2>



<p>You don&rsquo;t have to spend a single cent to edit video like a pro. Well, you&rsquo;ll have to take a course or two to get as good as a pro, but you can use the same program as many pros&mdash;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve&amp;xcust=2-1-1955503-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Davinci Resolve</a>.</p>



<p>The program, from Blackmagic Design, is one of the four video editing program used in the movie and television industry, but unlike Adobe Premiere Pro, Avid Media Composer, and Apple Final Cut Pro, it&rsquo;s free for individual users. There&rsquo;s a paid version too, but it doesn&rsquo;t add much that the average home user will miss.</p>



<p>Davinci Resolve has an interface similar to Premiere, so if you&rsquo;ve tried that before, it might be a little easier to get started. However, because it&rsquo;s a professional program with everything needed to edit video for television, there&rsquo;s a learning curve. Expect to have to keep at it for a while and maybe watch the occasional guide on YouTube before you feel completely comfortable with the program.</p>



<p>Video editing in general is resource intensive, but Davinci Resolve is particularly so. It requires at least 16 gigabytes of RAM, an SSD for storage, and a graphics card or integrated graphics circuit with at least 2 gigabytes of video memory and support for OpenCL 1.2 or CUDA 11.</p>



<p>When you first start the program, you&rsquo;ll be prompted to start your first project and can also choose which set of keyboard shortcuts you want to use&mdash;if you have used Premiere, for example, you may choose the same keyboard shortcuts it uses, but otherwise you can choose the program&rsquo;s own shortcuts.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Davinci Resolve" class="wp-image-1808540" height="656" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/davinci-media.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Foundry</p></div>



<h3 id="importing-and-sorting">Importing and sorting</h3>



<p>Davinci Resolve is a so-called nonlinear editor, which means that any changes you make will not affect the original files. When you export a finished film, the program copies the selected parts from them and puts them together with the various effects and other changes you have made. Therefore, you can sort your original files as you wish, but be aware that you cannot delete or move them, as the program needs access to them in order to create a final film. For example, if you have the files on an external SSD and don&rsquo;t have it connected when you try to edit, the program will display a large &ldquo;Media Offline&rdquo; warning.</p>



<p>To add video files as clips to use in your projects, start by opening the <em>Media</em> tab. Then you can simply drag the files from Explorer into the program, which will chew on them for a while as the files load; they then end up in the <em>Media Storage</em>. Select a file to view the clip in the preview box at the top right. Here you can play the clip and also jump around in it via the timeline below.</p>



<p>Above the Media Storage area you will find <em>Media Pool</em>, which is also a grid of video clips. The difference between the two is that the Media Pool shows the files you have added to the open project. On the left is a panel where you can sort and organize all the clips&mdash;the Media Pool is also available in Davinci Resolve&rsquo;s other work tabs (<em>Cut</em>, <em>Edit</em>, <em>Fusion</em>, <em>Color,</em> and <em>Fairlight</em>). You can create bins to collect different types of clips&mdash;for example, for different scenes or different locations. You can also differentiate using color-coding.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Davinci Resolve" class="wp-image-1808542" height="656" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/davinci-o%CC%88verga%CC%8Ang.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Foundry</p></div>



<h3 id="cut-the-film">Cut the film</h3>



<p>Go to the <em>Cut</em> tab, where you will find the easier of two ways to put a film together. The interface here is divided into three main sections: the Timeline at the bottom where you place clips and do the actual editing, the Media Pool at the top left, from which you drag clips to be included in the Timeline, and the Preview at the top right.</p>



<p>Drag a clip from the Media Pool to the timeline to add it to your film. The simplest edit you can make is to trim the beginning and end. Hold your pointer to the edge of the clip so that it shows a small triangle, square brackets, and the beginning of a piece of film. Click and drag sideways to trim.</p>



<p>To divide clips into pieces so that you can work on each part separately, move the red time marker in the timeline and click the leftmost scissor button above the timeline.</p>



<p>You can also add only selected parts of a clip in the Media Pool to the timeline. Move the timestamp to where you want to add the new clip. Double-click the clip to open it in the preview. Locate the point in the clip you want to start at and press the <em>i</em> key. Then find the point in the clip you want to end at and press the <em>o</em> key. Then press <em>F12</em> to add the selected part of the clip to the timeline.</p>



<p>To add transitions between clips, you must trim the clips at least slightly on both sides of the transition. Then place the timestamp in the center of the clips. Click one of the transition buttons in the center above the timeline: <em>Dissolve</em> or <em>Smooth Cut</em>. If you have trimmed the clips sufficiently beforehand, the transition now appears in the timeline and you can play the preview to see the transition.</p>



<p>Now click on <em>Inspector</em> at the very top right. This shows the settings for the transition, such as how long it should be, and you can also change the type of transition.</p>



<h3 id="other-tabs">Other tabs</h3>



<p>The <em>Edit</em> tab is a more advanced type of editing with much finer control, but also more fiddling to get the film right, so I recommend starting with the Cut tab until you feel it&rsquo;s not enough.</p>



<p><em>Fusion</em> is Davinci Resolve&rsquo;s tool for building and working with special effects, and not something you should start with right away.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Davinci Resolve" class="wp-image-1808544" height="656" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/davinci-color.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Foundry</p></div>



<p><em>Color</em> is all about adjusting exposure and colors either for effect or to make different clips blend together better. It&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;ll start using pretty soon if you&rsquo;re putting together more ambitious films, such as the same scene shot with multiple cameras. The Color tab allows you to make these different angles show the same colors.</p>



<p>Two things you can try in the Color tab are <em>Auto Color</em>, which tries to optimize the colors in one or more selected clips, and automatic color-matching between clips. Select the clip you think has the right colors and then Ctrl-click on the clip you want to have the same colors. Right-click on the first one and select <em>Shot Match to this Clip</em>.</p>



<p><em>Fairlight</em> is all about audio editing and effects. For example, you can remove or at least reduce the noise from a windy recording.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Davinci Resolve" class="wp-image-1808547" height="656" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/davinci-export.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Foundry</p></div>



<p><em>Deliver</em> is the tab you use to export a finished film in a suitable format, and of course you can save different versions for different purposes. Here you can set the resolution, file format, and more before you start the export (which can take a while).</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lightworks" class="wp-image-1808548" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/lightworks.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Foundry</p></div>



<h2 class="toc" id="Lightworks">Lightworks: A professional program with a good free version</h2>



<p>If Davinci Resolve doesn&rsquo;t appeal to you, you can try another program used professionally, but with a different approach to free users. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://lwks.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1955503-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Lightworks</a> is a long-standing program that was used in the 1990s in Hollywood films such as <em>Pulp Fiction</em> and <em>Braveheart</em>. Thelma Schoonmaker, who has been editing Martin Scorcese films for 50 years, is one of its most famous users. The program has continued to evolve over the years, with different owners.</p>



<p>Since 2020, it is owned by the new company LWKS, started by two of the developers, who have chosen to provide the basic version of Lightworks completely free of charge. Unlike other &ldquo;demo&rdquo; versions of paid programs, almost nothing is missing. The only major limitation for home users is that finished films can only be exported at 720p resolution and not 1080p or 4K.</p>



<p>Like Davinci Resolve, Lightworks has a fairly steep learning curve. However, the interface has a clear focus on creativity, so if you roll up your sleeves and get started, it shouldn&rsquo;t take long to get decent results. The program can be controlled almost entirely with the keyboard, so focus on learning all the shortcuts.</p>

<p>You start by creating a project and adding clips via the <em>Import clips</em> button. The interface is divided into three parts: <em>Sources</em> (clips, effects, transitions) at the top left, <em>Preview</em> and <em>Info</em> at the top right, and <em>Timeline</em> along the entire bottom of the window. Once you have some clips, you can drag one to the timeline to add it to the film. Here&rsquo;s how to make simple cuts:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Move the red time marker to the right place in the clip.</li><li>Press the <em>C</em> key or the icon with two red arrows facing each other during the preview to split the clip.</li><li>Now you can edit each half of the clip separately.</li></ol>



<p>You can trim at the beginning or the end of a clip by either grabbing the edge and dragging with the mouse or moving the time marker with the <em>A</em> and <em>S</em> keys, pressing the <em>W</em> key to switch to trim mode and then press the <em>comma</em> or <em>point</em> to trim left or right. Press the <em>tab</em> when you are done.</p>



<p>If you have created a gap in the timeline by trimming in the center, you can automatically move the parts together by right-clicking in the gap and selecting <em>Close gap</em>.</p>



<p>Add simple transitions by selecting the tab <em>Transitions</em> at the top left and drag and drop a transition where you want it in the timeline and the program will do the rest.</p>

<p>To create an overlap between sound and image (called a J or L clip), you can temporarily mute either the video or audio track and trim the other. Trim forward in one and backward in the other by an equal number of frames, then move them back together with both active. Lightworks shows with a little red icon how many frames out of sync the tracks are so you can easily fix it if you made a mistake.</p>
