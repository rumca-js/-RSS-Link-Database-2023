## The Change review – Bridget Christie’s super-cool menopause comedy is like nothing else on TV

<p>She decides to take back 3.5 million minutes of domestic drudgery, jump on a motorcycle and set off on a voyage of self discovery. Hot flushes have never looked hotter! </p><p>Did no one think to cast standup Bridget Christie in the upcoming Barbie movie? If it’s true, as Christie asserts, that “The Hulk is the only menopausal role model in the history of TV and film”, then having Christie play Menopausal Barbie alongside Issa Rae as President Barbie and Nicola Coughlan as Diplomat Barbie in Greta Gerwig’s panorama of modern womanhood might have helped. As it is, she’s had to do it all herself. As usual. Christie writes and stars in The Change – her sitcom debut – as Linda, a much put-upon wife, mother and retail worker who reaches a crisis point at her 50th birthday party.</p><p>It’s not just the menopause. It’s also the cluelessness of her husband (Omid Djalili), the open disdain of her teenage children and society’s general denial of the full humanity of older women that pushes Linda over the edge. She determines to take back some of those 3.5 million minutes of domestic drudgery (she’s been keeping careful record) and heads off on an adventure of self-discovery. She looks pretty cool doing it too, astride her Triumph motorcycle, amid the mystical ancient woodlands of the Forest of Dean, in search of a time capsule she hid there as a 10-year-old. Thus, by the first commercial break of the first episode, The Change has already succeeded in its primary goal: Linda is the role model we’ve all been waiting for. Hot flushes never looked hotter.</p><p>The Change is on Channel 4.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/21/the-change-review-bridget-christies-super-cool-menopause-comedy-is-like-nothing-else-on-tv">Continue reading...</a>

## IVF, egg storage, fertility ‘windows’: I’m so relieved all that is behind me | Emma Brockes

<p>Record numbers of women are freezing their eggs. With advances in reproductive technologies come not just new possibilities, but new dilemmas</p><p>One of the great reliefs of middle age is not having to give any thought to fertility. That particular hustle, which can blow a hole through a woman’s 30s and early 40s – and even, thanks to the lottery-ticket promise of tiny advances in IVF, later – is mostly in the rear-view mirror by the time 50 rolls around, and what was once all-encompassing fades. For many women, I think, the predominant feeling looking back is: thank God that particular nightmare is over.</p><p>A report <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/20/rise-women-freezing-eggs-uk">released this week</a> by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) brings it all flooding back, pinging tiny depth charges off otherwise innocuous-sounding words – “cycle”, “storage”, even “window” gets a look-in – and yanking one back to a fraught and what seemed, at the time, never-ending period.</p><p>Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/21/ivf-egg-storage-fertility-windows-freezing-eggs-reproductive-technologies">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Our antiquated ideas about what an elite athlete should be are evolving. And the league’s foreign stars are showing there is more than one way to win</p><p>“<em>Basketball is not the main thing in my life. And probably never gonna be.</em>”</p><p>Those are not the words you might expect to hear from the Denver Nuggets’ point-center Nikola Jokić: a bonafide superstar, two-time league MVP, who was, at the time of these comments, about to head into his (and his franchise’s) first ever NBA finals (where he would win, handily, for that matter). But Jokić is not the type of superstar we’ve come to expect in the NBA. He has something that has been rare, and even frowned upon, among athletes of his caliber: perspective. So, in a world where work/life balance is a hot button topic, and we’ve recently lived through a pandemic that flipped our lives upside down, why are his sentiments so polarizing? And are they a true anomaly, or a bellwether?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/21/europes-jokic-and-antetokounmpo-show-america-how-to-be-a-balanced-superstar">Continue reading...</a>

Jennifer Lawrence plays Maddie, a woman in her early 30s who has been unlucky in love, who still lives in her childhood home, all alone since the death of her mother and not much idea about what to do with her life. She scratches a living as an Uber driver, but her car gets repossessed for non-payment of Montauk’s exorbitant property taxes on a house which she stubbornly won’t rent or sell to the arrogant tourist incomers who are pricing locals like her out of the neighbourhood.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/21/no-hard-feelings-review-jennifer-lawrence-comedy-plays-sex-work-for-laughs">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Honduran authorities are investigating a reported prison riot in which  at least 41 women died on Tuesday. The president of an association for prisoners' families, Delma Ordonez, told Reuters that a brawl had broken out at the prison in Tamara in the early hours of Tuesday between members of two rival gangs, Barrio 18 and the Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13). President Xiomara Castro said she was shocked by what she called the 'monstrous murder' of the women, which she blamed on powerful street gangs. Julissa Villanueva, the head of the country’s prison system, suggested the riot had started because of recent attempts by authorities to crack down on illicit activity inside prisons, and called Tuesday’s violence a result of 'the actions we are taking against organised crime'</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/20/honduras-prison-riot-women-killed">‘Monstrous murder’: 41 women killed in Honduras prison riot</a></p></li></ul> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2023/jun/21/honduras-families-seek-answers-prison-riot-many-dead-video-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Is environmental change behind the mysterious rise in allergies, from asthma to anaphylaxis?</p><p>Allergic begins with a minute-by-minute account of a man in a car having an allergic reaction to a bee sting. Author Theresa MacPhail is coolly scientific as she describes anaphylaxis progressing through his body, the rising panic of his helpless girlfriend and the firm resignation of the pharmacist who refused to give him adrenaline because the law forbade it. The man in the car was MacPhail’s father, and he died that day. The book continues, describing the science, politics and personal experience of allergies in the same matter-of-fact tone, with the same sense of building to a grimly inevitable conclusion. Allergic people, MacPhail says, are the “canaries in the environmental change coal mine”; the way we live is making allergies worse.</p><p>MacPhail, a medical anthropologist, has spent years researching allergies: what they are, why we have them and what, if anything, we can do to avoid them. The task is difficult because of the lack of standardisation of almost everything. The levels of allergens in skin-prick tests vary widely. So do immunotherapy treatments. Experts she spoke to couldn’t even agree what an allergy was. In one study, depending on which definition was used, “up to 39% of children went from having asthma to not having it”. Almost everyone she interviewed agreed that allergies are becoming both more prevalent and more severe, but there’s no agreed-on way to measure them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/21/allergic-by-theresa-macphail-review-in-canaries-the-coal-mine">Continue reading...</a>
