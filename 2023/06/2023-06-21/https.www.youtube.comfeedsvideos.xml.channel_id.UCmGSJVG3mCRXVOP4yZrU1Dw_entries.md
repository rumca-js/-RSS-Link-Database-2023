My next video is live on Nebula NOW! It's the first episode of a new series we’re calling Eyes Only - where we use leaked and declassified documents to understand what’s really happening behind the scenes. The first episode is about the US's secret Cold War plan to invade Cuba. Watch now: https://nebula.tv/videos/johnnyharris-the-secret-cold-war-plan-to-invade-cuba
