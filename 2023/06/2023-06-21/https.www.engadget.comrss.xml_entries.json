Dropbox AI scans your documents, providing summaries and answers, while the more ambitious Dropbox Dash serves as a unified search bar for your life.</p><p>Dropbox AI is the simpler of the two new offerings. It applies artificial intelligence to file previews, offering summaries and a natural language Q&amp;A about your docs. \u201cWith the click of a button, you can summarize your content, like contracts and meeting recordings, into a concise explanation,\u201d the company explained. Or, ask Dropbox AI questions about the content of a specific file, and it can answer. \u201cWith Dropbox AI, now you can pull up a file, ask it anything, and Dropbox will read the document for you and give you an answer,\u201d CEO Drew Houston said in a promotional video.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Meanwhile, Dropbox Dash has a much broader scope, essentially serving as a souped-up and AI-powered version of Apple Spotlight search, Windows Search or third-party launcher apps like Alfred. Dropbox wants Dash to be your one-stop shop for anything you need to know \u2014 locally or online. \u201cDropbox Dash is AI-powered universal search that connects all of your tools, content, and apps in a single search bar,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cWith connectors to major platforms like Google Workspace, Microsoft Outlook, Salesforce, and more, you can find everything in one place, fast.\u201d The idea is to provide customers with a ChatGPT-like dialog box that answers questions about all the personal and work-related content in your digital universe.</p><figure><img alt=\"Screenshot (over teal blue background) of a browser window with an overlay for Dropbox Dash.

The company organizes URLs into Stacks, described as \u201cSmart collections for your links that offer a quick way to save, organize, and retrieve URLs\u201d \u2014 similar to how playlists store songs. The extension also adds a start-page dashboard showing search, Stacks, shortcuts and other suggested contextual items. Finally, Dropbox says Dash will eventually \u201cpull from your information and your company\u2019s information to answer questions and surface relevant content using generative AI.\u201d (For example, you could skip searching your business\u2019s internal links and pages and ask Dash when the next company holiday is.)</p><p>Trusting a company with all that data is a tall order. Dropbox wants to assure customers that it\u2019s prepared for that responsibility \u2014 pledging to be transparent and not sell your data to advertisers. \u201cIn this next era of AI, it\u2019s more important than ever that we protect our customers\u2019 privacy, act transparently, and limit bias in our AI technologies so they\u2019re built as fairly and reliably as possible,\u201d the company said.</p><p>As lofty as Dropbox\u2019s ambitions are with Dash, I can\u2019t help but see an AI-powered \u201csearch box for everything\u201d as a logical extension of modern operating systems. I\u2019d be surprised if Apple, Microsoft and Google haven\u2019t already been working on their versions of an AI-infused universal search bar to eventually bake into their products on the OS level. If those suspicions are correct, that could leave Dropbox with a brief window to establish Dash before the heavy hitters step in and make a third-party variant redundant for most customers.</p><p>Dropbox AI for file previews is available in alpha today for Dropbox Pro customers in the US.

This time, it\u2019s real-time. With <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>, the series\u2019 creators have decided that the future of the franchise is action-centric and storyline driven. And it\u2019s been inspired by epic fantasy series from television. Until now, the Final Fantasy games have never quite had their angry, moody dark moment. With nuanced, occasionally horny characters and often a lot of violence, is this the series\u2019 moody teenager era?</p><p><em>FFXVI </em>is the first game in the series made for the PS5, expanding the detail of both character models and environments. While the significant characters move and emote realistically, Square Enix has kept an artistic touch to character design. The most impressive parts are the environments, with gorgeous forests, medieval fortresses and major landmarks towering over the usual fields and cliffs you\u2019ll be exploring and fighting at. The quality isn't consistent enough in an era of games like <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/horizon-forbidden-west-review-water-robot-dinos-080126554.html\"><em>Horizon: Forbidden West</em></a><em>, Dead Space </em>and<em>&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/elden-ring-12-million-copies-18-days-105555964.html\"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>, though. I noticed when character models and environments weren\u2019t given the same attention as key scenes and chapters.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Unlike previous Final Fantasy games, while there\u2019s still an ensemble cast, you\u2019ll only ever control the protagonist <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/final-fantasy-xvi-preview-demo-release-date-130020481.html\">Clive</a> \u2014 yes, an interesting choice in hero name, one that even some in-game characters are... surprised by. You\u2019ll eventually be able to offer simple commands to your faithful wolf, Torgal, and you\u2019ll be joined by other companions that will fight entirely independently of you. These include your childhood friend Jill, the mysterious daddy of thunder, Cid, and several more spoiler(ish) additions.</p><p>Fortunately, and unlike an awful lot of non-playable battle allies in RPGs, they can usually attract the attention of a monster or two and even finish off enemies by themselves. Still, there\u2019s no escaping the fact that it\u2019s an even looser party battle dynamic than its predecessor <em>Final Fantasy XV,</em> let alone older titles.</p><p>The tale of <em>FFXVI</em> is achingly <em>Game Of Thrones</em>-y. It starts out as a battle of warring states, of religion versus monarchy, wars for the sake of controlling resources \u2014 or escaping inhospitable land. Sometimes the inspiration is a little on the nose: Dad dies early on? Check. Mysterious wolves? Check. Creepy mother-son relations? Check. However, the series has always drawn on pop-culture inspiration over the years: Dungeons and Dragons, Star Wars and Lord of the Rings have all been tugged at for monster names, storylines and more.</p><section><img alt=\"Final Fantasy XVI review\" class=\"e2ehero-url\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/355e2eb0-1010-11ee-bffb-d4e2656d5dae\" style=\"height: 1350px; width: 2400px;\" /></section><p>Within the opening hours, we meet Clive, his sickly (but \u2018chosen\u2019) younger brother Joshua and their childhood friend, Jill. Clive and Joshua\u2019s mother, the Cersei-styled Anabella Rosfield, swiftly betrays her family and the entire nation. The leader, her husband, is slaughtered in front of Joshua, whose latent powers as a dominant fully awakened due to this trauma. Arguably even more harrowing, a chocobo (the game series\u2019 giant bird mounts) gets bricked in the <em>head</em> and someone kills an <em>owl</em>. This all happens in the span of a couple of minutes.</p><p>In the form of the giant fire Eikon (elemental deity), Phoenix, Joshua burns enemies and allies alike to ash, and as Clive watches, horrified, he somehow unleashes a new, never-before-seen Eikon of his own, Ifrit, who has a surprisingly grisly encounter with Phoenix. Clive wakes up with no memory of this, however, while a foreboding figure in a hood watches all of this unfold, So yeah, the perfect pilot episode of a fantasy series on HBO. The superb voice acting and writing really helps sell the melodrama and seriousness of the story. For a series often criticized for cliche or awkward translations, this is all so much better. The voice actor for Cid is Ralph Ineson \u2013 who was even in<em> GoT. </em>Get ready for lots of Yorkshire accents: It\u2019s time for all to learn what \u201cta-ra\u201d means. Square Enix notes that, even if you pick the Japanese language setting, the game\u2019s lip sync is set to the English version.</p><figure><img alt=\"Final Fantasy XVI review\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/5b621f70-101c-11ee-abf7-5e355e39c797\" style=\"height: 1350px; width: 2400px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Square Enix</div></figure><p>If you haven\u2019t played a Final Fantasy title before \u2014 and Square Enix is positioning this as an action game for that kind of player \u2014 Ifrit is usually a run-of-the-mill summonable demon. He\u2019s rarely a crucial plot pivot, so it\u2019s cool to see the series subvert expectations and pay tribute to the games of the past. There are lots of Easter eggs like this, both subtle and obvious.</p><p>The crystal theme, originally penned for the first Final Fantasy game on the Nintendo Entertainment System, is remixed and dropped in during multiple points of the game, while Cid (a character found in every FF game, either as a non-playable character or party member) has a daughter called Mid \u2014 a reference to the grandson of <em>Final Fantasy V</em>'s version of Cid.</p><p>While other games, including spin-offs and <em>Final Fantasy XV</em>, have touched on real-time combat, <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em> goes all in. It\u2019s dangerous new territory for a series with some die-hard fans, but possibly a necessary move to attract a new audience.</p><p>But it\u2019s not Devil May Fantasy. It doesn\u2019t appear to be a particularly deep system on either the default or story-centric difficulties. I found myself leaning on abilities I knew could do sustained damage, doing well-timed dodges and countering.</p><p>There are layers to battles \u2013 but they\u2019re easy to ignore. Mid-game skills like the ability to jump and then kick-off an enemy, or launch yourself into the air with a pull attack normally used to sling smaller enemies toward you, offer some more vertical approaches to combat. However, I rarely needed to figure this out during battles, and it was more about relentlessly attacking and paying attention to incoming attacks that enemies usually signposted. Clive will bolster his initial fire attacks, courtesy of Phoenix, with skills from other Eikons, adding new forms of attack or counters. If there\u2019s some kind of elemental scissors-paper-rock dynamic, I didn\u2019t notice it, or missed an explanation.</p><p>The major difference between action- and story-focus modes is the inclusion of several accessories that make <em>FFXVI</em> one of the most accessible (and forgiving) action RPGs I\u2019ve ever played. You\u2019ll start the game with a handful of accessories like the Ring of Timely Focus which slows down when an evadable attack approaches, giving you ample time to dodge. The Ring of Timely Strikes will unleash a barrage of complex attacks just by spamming the square button. I played with the Ring of Timely Focus occasionally equipped, helping me to hold my own in more difficult scenes filled with enemies, but tried to fight the bigger enemies (and bosses) with only my own skills. There is a new game plus mode that offers hardier enemies and challenges, but I haven\u2019t had time to play it yet.</p><p>The bosses, while spectacular, have a tendency towards being damage sponges \u2013 especially the Eikon-on-Eikon fights that typically include three or more transitions in a single battle. Once you\u2019ve figured out the timing of dodges to attacks, it\u2019s often repeated to boredom. But hey, they always look cool. Some of these boss fights are.. incredibly epic \u2013 and I mean Bayonetta-level of ridiculous. There aren\u2019t many boss battles in video games that reach the level of Clive\u2019s duel against Bahamut\u2026</p><p><em>Final Fantasy XVI </em>also has a wonderful hidden weapon: Its own built-in wiki. Active Time Lore, a play on active time battles from the series\u2019 arguable heyday of the late-\u201990s, not only fills in the narrative gaps plaguing FF but plenty of other politically tilted RPGs.</p><p>Both <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2016-06-06-remastered-final-fantasy-xii-comes-to-ps4-in-2017.html\"><em>FFXII</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2012-01-13-why-final-fantasy-xiii-just-didnt-work.html\"><em>FFXIII</em></a> suffered from lots of fictional terminology and complicated back-story. With the latter, developers relegated anything close to a glossary to menus that were difficult to navigate and consequently rarely investigated.</p><figure><img alt=\"Final Fantasy XVI\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/fad0e270-1022-11ee-9f26-0f7e5f5fccb0\" style=\"height: 1350px; width: 2400px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Square Enix</div></figure><p>Active Time Lore, which can be summoned from the touchpad during almost any scene or area, brings a convenient shortcut to that tip-of-the-tongue, which-warring-state-is-he-from-again quandary. It\u2019s an elegant solution, inspired by Amazon Prime Video\u2019s X-Ray feature. It also ensures gamers don\u2019t come undone when there are so many political maneuverings, time skips, false deaths and hooded strangers.</p><p>All of this is augmented by Vivian, a character whose sole purpose appears to be educating Clive about the wider political implications of his fight to dismantle the political structure around huge magical crystals (by destroying them), dominants (by besting them, usually) and freeing indentured magic-wielding slaves. All while seeking vengeance for his brother.</p><p>Talking with her at your base of operations will open a handy personnel chart of all the main characters, their associates, and the rest. It also comes with a chronological slider, so you can guess who\u2019ll betray who next. If you came undone during a season of Game of Thrones, you might understand why this could be needed.</p><figure><img alt=\"Final Fantasy XVI review\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/357475d0-1010-11ee-bfef-b33476296374\" style=\"height: 1350px; width: 2400px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Square Enix</div></figure><p><em>Final Fantasy XVI </em>is different \u2013 perhaps due to the producer, Naoki Yoshida, who worked on the online MMORPG <em>Final Fantasy XIV </em>as both producer and director.

I miss the party battle dynamics, but I didn\u2019t feel hamstrung by my own mediocre action game reflexes or skills. If you are looking for challenging battles, the game comes with post-game content aimed at completionists and the muscular of thumb.

Part of its appeal is the Google brand, plus the promise of regular free software updates and tight integrations with most of the world\u2019s smart home players. In a head-to-head race, the Nest WiFi Pro will be bested by plenty of its competitors, but Google\u2019s user-friendliness means it\u2019s the default option for pretty much everyone.</p><h2>Hardware</h2><p>As I said in our main mesh WiFi buyer\u2019s guide, I\u2019ve been using Google\u2019s first-generation version for years, and also reviewed the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-07-google-nest-wifi-review.html\">second-generation Nest WiFi</a>, so I feel like this is my turf. The Nest WiFi Pro is Google\u2019s first to harness WiFi 6/6E, which was irritatingly omitted from the last model on cost grounds. Because of this, they can\u2019t integrate with your existing Google / Nest WiFi hardware, meaning that any upgrade will require you to start fresh.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p></p><p>In terms of looks, the Pros are ovoid bumps that stand taller than their predecessors and demand more space. \u2018Round back, you\u2019ll find the jack for the barrel power cable and two ethernet ports which Google <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N0b3JlLmdvb2dsZS5jb20vZ2IvcHJvZHVjdC9uZXN0X3dpZmlfcHJvX3NwZWNzP2hsPWVuLUdCIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiOTQ3NGNjMC0xMTNlLTQ0OTgtOTg1Ny1iMmViYjM4Y2QxYmEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWM091X6ch4uP8cGZ1wh-fH9fPzyVL_jejqhzMoCzpsP&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.google.com%2Fgb%2Fproduct%2Fnest_wifi_pro_specs%3Fhl%3Den-GB\">says</a> \u201csupport 1 Gbps wired speeds per router.\u201d Inside, it packs a Cortex A35 dual-core 64-bit ARM CPU paired with 1GB of RAM and 4GB of storage like its predecessor. It is available in four colors: Snow, Linen, Fog and Lemongrass.</p><p>The Nest WiFi Pro doesn\u2019t reserve a chunk of its spectrum for dedicated backhaul. Instead, it dynamically shunts traffic around the available space for optimal performance, which will primarily take place on the 6GHz band, since plenty of devices in our homes don\u2019t have the components necessary to access it. <a href=\"https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/12367191?hl=en\">Google adds</a> that using 6GHz as backhaul frees up lots of space in the 2.4 and 5GHz bands, improving performance for all the other devices on the network.</p><p>One interesting tweak from the last model is that you can\u2019t get the Pro with a built-in smart speaker. This is  good, since I never liked the idea of having a speaker inside my WiFi apparatus. But I will concede that I did like being able to use Spotify Connect on the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-07-google-nest-wifi-review.html\">original Nest WiFi</a> in my kitchen without buying another speaker.</p><h2>Installation</h2><p>Since it's a Google product, expect the Nest WiFi Pro to be relatively easy to install through your phone \u2014 for most of the process. If you, like me in this instance, already had a Google mesh in place, you'll need to factory reset, wipe and deactivate everything. Once done, you can just connect the first node to your modem with an ethernet cable (supplied) and let the app do the rest for you.</p><p>The Google Home app will almost instantly find the new product waiting to be installed and get you started. It took me ten minutes to get the first one running, and that included an unrelated issue with my cable modem that forced me to restart. It took another ten minutes to install the other nodes, but all I had to do was scan the QR code and follow the on-screen instructions.</p><p>The app doesn\u2019t offer any advice about optimum node placement or identifying potential weak spots. Google\u2019s website offers the stock line that you should put a node halfway between the primary and wherever in your home you need WiFi. That\u2019s fine, but I suspect novice users might appreciate more guidance, especially if they\u2019re struggling with structural issues that mean adjoining rooms aren\u2019t getting a good signal.</p><h2>Performance</h2><figure><img alt=\"Image of three Nest WiFi Pro units, rear-on, in front of a blurred bookcase.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/e6473090-0c56-11ee-9ebf-ecd2c1872324\" style=\"height: 1200px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Daniel Cooper / Engadget</div></figure><p>I don\u2019t have many WiFi 6E-compatible devices at home, and there was a fair distance between the nearest node and my office, so I didn't have high hopes that switching to the new system would deliver great gains. Yet, compared to the WiFi module in my office, which is connected via Ethernet to my modem, I saw my speed jump from around 120 Mbps to an average of 240 Mbps.</p><p>The only place where the Nest WiFi Pro\u2019s connection was anything other than eye-wateringly fast was in my notorious back bedroom. The room, surrounded by Victorian (and modern) plumbing, was previously barren territory for my older system, but it was now joined up here. And while speeds fell to 63 Mbps, I never saw a dropout or stutter in performance. In fact, WiFi performance in that room is more than sufficient to work and take video calls.</p><p>Despite the fewer modules, connectivity was stable and I never noticed a drop when I ran between rooms. Armed with all the devices I could muster, me and my kids scuttled around the house walking to the furthest points of the house watching plenty of streamed video, and none reported an issue. My average speed tests shook down to close to 250 Mbps, and the connection was smooth enough for my purposes.</p><h2>Additional features</h2><p>The Nest WiFi Pro supports Matter and Thread, so you can control your smart home from the Google Home app. When I opened the app after installing the new hardware, it asked if I wanted to connect to my Philips Hue and iRobot products. You\u2019ll still need to have your Hue Bridge connected, however, so you\u2019re not saving a plug on your Ethernet switch. That\u2019s unfortunate compared to, say, some Eero models which have built-in Zigbee units that allow you to ditch the bridge entirely. But if you\u2019re all-in on Google\u2019s Assistant then you\u2019ll  benefit from having everything hooked up inside one app.</p><p>A key selling point of Google\u2019s network products is the promise to keep them up to date with software and security updates. The company has rolled out <a href=\"https://support.google.com/googlenest/topic/6318633?sjid=3172454786104930652-EU\">fairly regular updates</a> over the last seven years and there\u2019s no indication yet that it\u2019s going to stop. I\u2019ve been fairly happy with the work done for my first-generation Google WiFi pucks. If I do have a concern, it\u2019s that Google sometimes axes products not long after launch, so you do run the risk of investing in the company only for its impatience to get the better of it.</p><h2>App and controls</h2><p>I preferred when you could control your Google WiFi through the standalone app, but these days it\u2019s all rolled into the company\u2019s Home app. That\u2019s great as a one-stop shop for any compatible smart home gadgets you might have, but it\u2019s less comprehensive. When managing your network, you can look at per-device traffic, set priority access (or pause connection to) any device on the network. You\u2019ll also be able to run speed and mesh connection tests to ensure that your network performance is optimal.</p><p>Some of these features aren\u2019t standard on other routers, and some you need to pay extra to access. Others may offer you a good deal more, too. If you\u2019re looking for more fine-grain control, you probably won\u2019t find it on the Nest. As much as Google calls this a \u201cPro\u201d router, it\u2019s more to gesture toward being<em> more premium</em>, rather than for actual professionals. There\u2019s no access to some of the harder-core settings or browser-based controls page for power users. Instead, this is a locked-down, curated experience for people who want their WiFi to work without much .</p><p>For parental controls, you can set up groups within the Family WiFi menu to pause multiple devices at once. You can also schedule access times, a feature that several other mesh products expect you to pay to use. And while there\u2019s no specific way to filter individual websites, you can designate some hardware to be routed via Google\u2019s SafeSearch to block a broad swathe of content online. What this system lacks is any fine-grain control for concerned parents or the ability to monitor a specific device\u2019s browsing history. But I\u2019ve always been of the opinion that overzealous parenting just creates kids who learn at a young age to hide what they\u2019ve been up to.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>What Google\u2019s WiFi products have always offered is a fairly acceptable blend of power, price and performance. You won\u2019t be getting into the nitty-gritty parts of running a network, but you\u2019re also not paying a huge amount of cash. It should appeal to people who really don\u2019t want to worry about doing much more than running the odd speed test and quickly setting up a guest network without any stress. Something like the TP-Link XE75 might run faster and offer more features, but for this price, Google\u2019s remained true to its ethos of making the right compromises.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/nest-wifi-pro-review-googles-wifi-6e-mesh-is-more-approachable-than-the-rest-130029818.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/nest-wifi-pro-review-googles-wifi-6e-mesh-is-more-approachable-than-the-rest-130029818.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-21 13:00:29+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Apple Podcasts update makes it easier to find content in your favorite genres", "description": "<p>Apple has <a href=\"https://podcasters.apple.com/5304-elevating-nine-podcast-subcategories-charts\">updated</a> its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-iphone-cases-153035988.html\">Podcasts app</a> on iOS, iPadOS and macOS with features that make it easier to find content in your favorite genres.

We\u2019ve already tested the S5 II but now we\u2019re looking at what I think is the more interesting model, the S5 IIX. It has an identical design and many of the same features as its sibling, like the new autofocus system and highly effective in-body stabilization. However, it adds a key function: the ability to record high-quality, easy-to-edit ProRes video internally. The new autofocus is good but not quite up to the Sony A7 IV, and it lacks the full-frame 4K 60p video of the Canon R6 II, but it\u2019s far better for video than both models, thanks to the ProRes option and other features not in either rival model.

The new <a href=\"https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2023/06/20/introducing-content-classification-labels/\">Content Classification Labels</a> are mature-rated games, sexual themes, significant profanity or vulgarity, gambling, violent and graphic depictions and, lastly, drugs, intoxication or excessive tobacco use.</p><p>The ratings apply to both the game and you. For example, if you're playing a mature-rated game, Twitch will automatically label it as such. But, if you're playing an E-rated game and excessively swearing, you will need to mark your stream as having significant profanity or vulgarity. In general, it's pretty obvious when to use a label based on their names, but Twitch's <a href=\"https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Content-Classification-Guidelines?language=en_US\">Content Classification Guidelines</a> break down when to use each one in incredible detail (from pose examples to categorizing swear words). The rules around what's not allowed on streams have stayed the same.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>You can access Content Classification Labels in the Stream Manager's &quot;Edit Stream Info&quot; section below the language control. A pull-down menu will show the six options with a short description following each. All you need to do is click whichever applies to your current stream and, if it changes, add or remove them as you go.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt=\"A pull down shows different labels to choose for the Twitch stream. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/68b1ada0-1010-11ee-9fbd-adecca143bdf\" style=\"height: 576px; width: 831px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Twitch</div></figure><p>Keep in mind that whatever labels remain checked when you end a stream will be automatically applied to your next one unless you unclick them. You can <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitch-reporting-and-appeals-tools-181800017.html\">report users to Twitch</a> (and vice versa) for not including required labels, and if Twitch agrees, they will issue a warning.</p><p>While these new Content Classification Labels are already available to use, Twitch is giving everyone an adjustment period of sorts. You can still get warnings, but Twitch will only start tallying them after July 20. At that point, &quot;repeated warnings&quot; will likely still not get you suspended with Twitch, instead opting to lock certain classifications onto your account for a set amount of days or weeks.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/twitch-replaces-its-mature-content-mode-with-more-granular-labels-100501056.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/twitch-replaces-its-mature-content-mode-with-more-granular-labels-100501056.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-21 10:05:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Instagram finally lets users download Reels", "description": "<p>TikTok has enjoyed a significant advantage over Instagram Reels in that anyone can download a TikTok video and post it to another social media network \u2014 something that helps draw new users to the platform. Now, Instagram has finally gained that ability, according to a post by CEO Adam Mosseri (using the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/instagram-is-rolling-out-its-telegram-like-broadcast-channels-worldwide-160815133.html\">new broadcast channels</a> feature) spotted by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/20/instagram-now-finally-allows-users-to-download-public-reels/\"><em>TechCrunch</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The feature is only available to US users on mobile for now, and only for public and not private accounts. At the same time, users with public accounts can choose a setting that blocks users from downloading their Reels. To use the feature, you tap on the &quot;Share&quot; icon for a given Reel and select &quot;Download.&quot;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img alt=\"Instagram now lets users download Reels to their smartphones\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/cda6b5c0-1010-11ee-bfb5-4782b8f3923b\" style=\"height: 1276px; width: 1312px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Engadget</div></figure><p>An image posted by Mosseri (top) appears to show that downloaded Reels will be watermarked with the Instagram logo and name of the account, much as TikTok does. YouTube also started <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/youtube-watermarking-shorts-videos-080310791.html\">adding watermarks</a> to Shorts videos created on desktop, likely also as a way to bring attention to its short video feature.&nbsp;</p><p>Instagram now appears to be taking the same tack, likely also seeing it as a way to ensure people see Reels on other social media networks. It's not going out of its way to accommodate videos from rival platforms, though. The Meta-owned company allows TikTok and other videos to be uploaded, but its algorithms <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/instagram-reels-repost-tiktoks-best-practices-200536658.html\">stopped promoting</a> any watermarked videos from rivals back in 2021.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/instagram-finally-lets-users-download-reels-093425845.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/instagram-finally-lets-users-download-reels-093425845.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-21 09:35:07+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Popular subreddits welcomed porn content to protest Reddit's API changes", "description": "<p>While most subreddits <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/popular-subreddits-plan-to-extend-blackouts-indefinitely-205005565.html\">that went dark</a> to oppose the website's API changes are now live and active again, some moderators aren't done protesting the changes on the platform. As <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/20/23767098/reddit-subreddits-porn-protest\"><em>The Verge</em></a> reports, several popular subreddits that historically prohibited porn have started allowing users to post NSFW or Not Safe For Work content. These communities include r/interestingasfuck, r/TIHI (Thanks, I Hate It), r/mildlyinteresting and r/videos.&nbsp;</p><p>In r/TIHI's case, for instance, a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/TIHI/comments/14cghn3/welcome_back/\">stickied post</a> says the subreddit is removing a rule that forbids extreme NSFW content and will now welcome them, as long as they're legal under US law. A <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/14c0vcf/rinterestingasfuck_will_be_reopening_monday_june/\">similar post</a> on r/interestingasfuck lists a smaller and less restrictive set of new rules, including labeling whether a post is NSFW or not and prohibiting sexual content with minors. By allowing their subreddits to be filled with posts deemed not safe for work, the moderators have made sure that Reddit can't monetize them. NSFW subreddits haven't been eligible <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditforBusiness/comments/bdwlin/update_to_nsfw_advertising_policy/\">for ad targeting in years</a>, and the website doesn't allow ads for adult-oriented products, as well.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Reddit's response to the situation has been swift \u2014 administrators have reportedly removed whole moderating teams for communities that have labeled themselves NSFW. If you take a look at the r/interestingasfuck and r/TIHI subreddits, you'll see that their moderator boxes are empty, save for a note that says &quot;This subreddit is unmoderated. Visit r/redditrequest to request it.&quot; Reddit spokesperson Tim Rathschmidt told <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/20/23767848/reddit-blackout-api-protest-moderators-suspended-nsfw\"><em>The Verge</em></a>: &quot;Moderators incorrectly marking a community as NSFW is a violation of both our Content Policy and Moderator Code of Conduct.&quot;</p><p>The other subreddits mentioned now have a full moderating team and no longer have explicit posts. It's unclear whether the mods themselves decided to go back to regular programming or whether they were forced to do so. Several r/mildlyinteresting moderators told the publication that while it's true they were locked out of their subreddits by a Reddit admin, they were reinstated by a different administrator. Said admin reversed the seven-day suspension they got, as well.</p><p>All these events stemmed from Reddit's decision to start charging access to its API. Reddit was originally targeting companies scraping the website for content used to train Large Language Models for generative AI, but its decision also affects thousands of third-party clients and apps that tie into the platform, including ones with moderation tools. Thousands of communities protested the move by <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/reddit-sees-more-than-6000-communities-go-dark-in-protest-over-api-changes-095311637.html\">setting their subreddits</a> private and making them inaccessible.&nbsp;</p><p>Reddit CEO Steve Huffman, however, was <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-reddit-blackout-is-already-forcing-unexpected-changes-103521266.html\">unmoved</a> by the protest and told the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/06/15/1182457366/reddit-ceo-steve-huffman-its-time-we-grow-up-and-behave-like-an-adult-company?refresh=true\"><em>NPR</em></a>: &quot;It's a small group that's very upset, and there's no way around that.

A company representative <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/14bwfai/moderators_voice_concerns_over_reddits/\">echoed</a> that sentiment in a post on the website and added: &quot;If a moderator team unanimously decides to stop moderating, we will invite new, active moderators to keep these spaces open and accessible to users&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/popular-subreddits-welcomed-porn-content-to-protest-reddits-api-changes-061033337.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/popular-subreddits-welcomed-porn-content-to-protest-reddits-api-changes-061033337.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-21 06:10:33+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Amazon Prime Day kicks off July 11th this year", "description": "<p>Amazon has officially <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-prime-day-2023-date\">announced</a> the dates for its next annual shopping event. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-day-2023-124519231.html\">Prime Day 2023</a> will be on July 11th and 12th this year \u2014 the event will begin at 12AM PT/3AM ET on Tuesday, July 11th, and conclude at the end of the day on Wednesday, July 12th. As it has been for the past few years, Prime Day will be a two-day event during which Prime members can snag deals on everything from electronics to fashion to Amazon's own devices.</p><p>The past couple of years saw Prime Day in different seasons, mostly due to COVID-19 repercussions. In 2020, Amazon had to delay Prime Day until October, and it rebounded a bit in 2021 by having Prime Day in June.

Prime Day isn\u2019t necessarily a perk of Prime like access to Prime Video content or free two-day shipping are, but it certainly helps that most deals you\u2019ll find on Amazon during the two-day event are exclusively available to Prime members. However, that doesn\u2019t change the fact that the cost of Prime has increased quite a bit since its launch in 2005, and even within the past few years. An annual membership will set you back $139 right now, $20 more than its previous price.</p><p>If you do plan on putting that Prime membership to use next month, you can turn to Engadget to find the tech deals worth your month during the two-day event. Unsurprisingly, Amazon Prime Day is one of the best times of the year to get Amazon devices, since most of them will likely be down to all-time-low prices. But we also expect to see worthwhile sales on headphones, robot vacuums, laptops, SSDs and much more.
