If you said the Valve Index, you&rsquo;re wrong: <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/search?q=meta+quest+2#gsc.tab=0&amp;gsc.q=meta%20quest%202&amp;gsc.page=1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">it&rsquo;s the Meta Quest 2</a>. Yes, the stand-alone, wireless headset from Facebook&rsquo;s parent company is by far the most popular option, even for gamers who just want something to connect to a PC, because it&rsquo;s cheap and has tons of tools for doing so. That means the new, just-announced <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.meta.com/en-gb/blog/quest/vr-hardware-news-quest-3-sneak-peek-price-drop/&amp;xcust=2-2-1938809-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Meta Quest 3</a> will probably take its place when it arrives later this year. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Quest 2 was a gentle revision from the original design, more focused on the ecosystem than the hardware. That&rsquo;s not the case with the Quest 3. Even with the short preview video posted by Meta, we can see it&rsquo;s inheriting a ton of advanced hardware and capability from the much more expensive Quest Pro. The Quest 3 will feature a new Snapdragon processor with &ldquo;double the GPU power,&rdquo; higher-resolution displays, new controllers with more advanced haptics and without the sensor rings, and a 40 percent thinner build. Those last two points should make it a lot easier to throw on for a quick session, to say nothing of travel. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But perhaps the biggest change is full-color pass-through cameras with depth sensors, enabling the Quest 3 to function as a full augmented reality set as well as VR. The Quest 2 had pass-through camera functionality, but it was sort of bootstrapped onto the motion and position sensor system, limited to choppy black-and-white video just to let you walk around a room without tripping over an ottoman like Dick Van Dyke. The new system is fully capable of AR gaming&hellip;the better to compete with <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/557878/apple-reality-headset-ar-vr-design-features-specs-price.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Apple&rsquo;s much-rumored AR system</a>, no doubt. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Quest 2 and Quest 3 size comparison \" class=\"wp-image-1938862\" height=\"439\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/350954660_231811119570856_2438219435834379037_n.png\" width=\"780\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Meta</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Though Meta didn&rsquo;t show it, presumably the Quest 3 will preserve the ability to connect to a local gaming PC, either wirelessly or via USB-C, and play PC VR games through Steam VR or Quest&rsquo;s proprietary store. Despite raising the price significantly to $500, it&rsquo;ll still be the cheapest new VR system around, and won&rsquo;t require the extra dedicated room sensors of Valve and HTC&rsquo;s hardware. If you&rsquo;re looking for an even cheaper solution, the older Quest 2 is getting a discount to $300 for the base model &mdash; which is technically just <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/820552/the-quest-2-is-now-100-more.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a return to its original retail price</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Quest 3 will get a more thorough technical breakdown before its release, sometime in the fall of 2023. </p>\n\nVirtual Reality</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1938809/the-meta-quest-3-is-thinner-faster-and-pricier-at-500.html", "date_published": "2023-06-01 15:00:31+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "The Full Nerd: Computex\u2019s hottest PC hardware trends (with Paul\u2019s Hardware, Ian Cutress, and Alex from LTT)", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello from Taiwan!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode of The Full Nerd, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/Gordonung&amp;xcust=2-1-1938793-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gordon Ung</a> and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/morphingball&amp;xcust=2-1-1938793-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/AdamPMurray&amp;xcust=2-1-1938793-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Adam Patrick Murray</a> are live from MSI&rsquo;s booth to talk about the hottest PC hardware trends of Computex 2023.

The company has also been on the cutting edge in terms of features&mdash;as seen in the U3000&rsquo;s integrated low-power radar. But the U3000 is also dauntingly pricey at $550 and we have some quibbles with the mounts and cabling. The features and captures are great, but that&rsquo;s a ton of cash for a dual-channel dash cam&mdash;parking RADAR or not.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>Further reading:</strong> See our roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/428348/best-dash-cam-reviews.html\">best dash cams</a> to learn about competing products.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"thinkware-u3000-design-and-features\">Thinkware U3000 design and features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The U3000 is a display-less (an app and voice feedback serve instead), dual-channel dash cam that includes both a 2160p/158 degree field-of-view front cam, and 1440p/ 128 degree FOV rear camera. Our test unit arrived with both auxiliary port and OBDII power cables. OBDII is by far the easiest way to provide constant power for parking surveillance as you don&rsquo;t have to tap any wires. Just plug it in to your vehicle&rsquo;s diagnostic port.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The front dash cam is removable, sliding to the left off the thin mounting plate that sticks to your windshield via semi-permanent double-sided tape. I was a bit disappointed that the sticky tape was old-school 3M without a tab protruding from the protective covering for easy removal. (Tip for my short-fingernailed fellows: Put your tape in the freezer for a few minutes to stiffen the sticky stuff and lower the adhesion factor.)</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Thinkware U3000 dual-channel dash cam\" class=\"wp-image-1928393\" height=\"872\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/thinkware-u3000-hero.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>Thinkware U3000 dual-channel dash cam</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Jon L. Jacobi</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I also was a bit disenchanted with the way the camera and mount coupled. There are three tabs on the mount that the camera hooks and locks onto; however, it wasn&rsquo;t all that easy to align the tabs with their holes as you can&rsquo;t see them during the process. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually, I noted the relative position of the top of the camera and mount and the procedure became easier, but give me a magnetic mount &agrave; la the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1529994/nexar-one-pro-dash-cam-review.html\">Nexar One Pro</a> or <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/394668/garmin-dash-cam-57-review.html\">Garmin&rsquo;s dash cams</a> any day. In a camera this expensive, fragile plastic tabs shouldn&rsquo;t be involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The back camera also mounts with sticky stuff, but there&rsquo;s no separate mounting plate so removal on a regular basis isn&rsquo;t feasible. No one stole the unit from my convertible parked here in San Francisco during testing, but left there long enough, it would definitely disappear.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1928400\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Thinkware-U3000-side-shot.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Jon Jacobi / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The main camera is approximately 4.3-inches long/high, by 2.7-inches wide, by 2.0 inches thick where the camera resides. (See below.) The rear camera measures around 3.1-inches wide, by more or less 1.5-inches thick and deep. The logo makes it easy to determine  the orientation, unlike with some rear cameras. (I have installed some upside down initially)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the right side of the main camera (when stuck to the windshield) is the micro card slot and venting, while on left there&rsquo;s only venting. The surface facing you when the camera is mounted is home to the microphone, Wi-Fi, on/off, and manual record buttons, as well as status lights for the Bluetooth/Wi-Fi, record, and GPS. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The top edge (when mounted) of the U3000 houses the mini-USB port for the rear camera, the DC power input, and 2.5mm jacks for the &ldquo;ext.&rdquo; (optional GPS antenna) and the &ldquo;bat.&rdquo; port (communication/power cable from an iVolt Xtra BAB-95 battery).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>By far the most unique feature of the U3000 is the low-power radar used to detect the presence of vehicles and people and wake the camera from semi-sleep in parking mode.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1928399\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Thinkware-U3000-lens.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>My main complaint here relates to the rather thick mini-USB cable that&rsquo;s included. After the thin cables and Type-C connectors offered by the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1518169/viofio-a139-pro-dash-cam-review.html\">Viofo A139 Pro</a>, this old-school solution just isn&rsquo;t as cool. Not to mention being harder to route and hide in the cabin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be sure to stick with the included 64GB Micro SD card. When I tried to use one of my own 128GB card, the U3000 got stuck in a &ldquo;Card format required&rdquo; loop, causing it to continually reboot. As this was before I&rsquo;d linked with the phone app, there was nothing to be done about it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><br />As for the U3000&rsquo;s phone app, it&rsquo;s called Thinkware Dash Cam Link. Unlike Nexar&rsquo;s app, it&rsquo;s compatible with my Pixel 4 (mostly&mdash;you must use Bluetooth rather than Wi-Fi linking initially). As the webcam itself lacks a display, the app is your only recourse for changing settings, etc. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, as the storage is removable, there was no repeat of the transfer issues I had with the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1529994/nexar-one-pro-dash-cam-review.html\">Nexar One Pro</a>. The app uses its own Wi-Fi hotspot when you employ the live view or want to view/offload captures</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1930293\" height=\"840\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Thinkware-U3000-app.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Live View, the main page, and one of the settings pages in the Thinkware app.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Thinkware was one of the first companies to offer bad driver, <em>excuse me</em>, &ldquo;road safety&rdquo; features for its dash cams. The U3000 follows suit with warnings of lane departure, forward and rear collision, as well as forward vehicle departure. I turn them off and pay attention to my driving. You may want them. Taste varies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By far the most unique feature of the U3000 is the low-power radar used to detect the presence of vehicles and people and wake the camera from semi-sleep in parking mode. This makes the U3000 ideal for surveillance, and should extend the run time of the mode beyond the usual 48 hours. Most cameras, including the U3000 will sense low voltage and turn off the camera completely. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>GPS is the icing on the U3000 cake, or should be. See below. I should mention that the U3000 is warrantied for a full year. Most Amazon bargain cams are 90 days. In a field not renowned for hardware longevity, 365 days is a good thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-does-the-thinkware-u3000-perform\">How does the Thinkware U3000 perform?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, the Thinkware U3000&rsquo;s captures were very good, at least in terms of color and detail. The front captures were better than the rear, though both offered very good detail. The rear camera had a slight tendency to overexpose in bright light, though it handled flaring at night almost as well as the front camera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Colors are rich without being oversaturated, and there aren&rsquo;t any appreciable motion artifacts such as tearing or bouncing. I did see mild stabilization issues in one capture, but that seemingly cured itself over the next few minutes of the drive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Right-click and select &ldquo;Open image in new tab&rdquo; or &ldquo;Save image&rdquo; to see the following captures in higher, or full resolution.</em></p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1814921\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Thinkware-U3000-front-day.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>This forward daytime capture doesn&rsquo;t show any license plates, but the street signs are easily readable.

The magic of AirJet is a combination of exotic materials, geometry, and physics: The 2.8mm chip has cavities in the top full of vibrating membranes, which blast cool air across the heat spreader underneath, cooling down a CPU or other component. Despite the miniscule dimensions, it can send individual air particles whooshing over the heat spreader at up to 200 kilometers per hour, letting PC vendors cool compact components much more effectively than ever before.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And boy does it. AirJet started showing up in actual products at Computex 2023. First, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1925950/1925950.html\">Zotac&rsquo;s previously passively cooled PI430AJ Pico mini-PC embraced AirJet</a> to upgrade from a two-core Atom processor to an Intel Core i3 with <em>eight</em> efficiency cores. That&rsquo;s a monumental leap in performance. Gordon also got a chance to see a Sabrent Rocket SSD running in a Thunderbolt enclosure to see the difference AirJet&rsquo;s active cooling can provide versus traditional passive designs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Watch it in action in the videos above, but spoiler alert: AirJet is some of the most exciting PC technology I&rsquo;ve seen in <em>years</em>. <em>&mdash;Brad Chacos</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"nvidia-ace-for-games\">Nvidia ACE for Games</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Nvidia&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-ace-for-games-sparks-life-into-virtual-characters-with-generative-ai&amp;xcust=2-1-1937288-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) for Games</a> offers us what feels like one future of PC gaming&mdash;and it&rsquo;s an odd one that may not come to pass. That&rsquo;s not because it&rsquo;s not possible: ACE envisions a future where NPCs are actually AIs, with natural language interactions powered by the cloud and/or your GPU. Imagine getting into a prolonged debate with a generic RPG merchant about the merits of lagers versus stouts, and you get the idea.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That means, conceptually, that that merchant might know everything there is to know about the world, including the game&rsquo;s major twists and turns. Or not. Or maybe just a piece of gossip that will advance the story. Narratively, AI characters may bog down the main story or completely undermine it, meaning that game designers may simply refuse to use ACE. But if AIs enter society, they&rsquo;ll eventually make their way into gaming. ACE could be the way. <em>&mdash;Mark Hachman</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"mobile-pixels-geminos\">Mobile Pixels&nbsp;Geminos&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Mobile Pixels Geminos\" class=\"wp-image-1937536\" height=\"577\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/mobile-pixels-geminos.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1024\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mobile Pixels</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I&nbsp;wasn&rsquo;t&nbsp;prepared to re-imagine the&nbsp;tried-and-true,&nbsp;side-by-side&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/395110/ultrawide-vs-dual-monitors.html\">dual-monitor setup</a>, but the&nbsp;Mobile Pixels&nbsp;Geminos&nbsp;has me doing just that.

It kind of looks like a futuristic terrarium at first glance due to its glass panels. The square build and angled top piece set it apart from more traditional-looking cases as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The unorthodox design is intentional, as it&rsquo;s meant to hold larger components and water-cooling systems. There&rsquo;s even quite a bit of space for cable management. The front fans are also positioned in a way that allows airflow through a mesh cover, which helps keep everything nice and cool. If you&rsquo;re serious about showing off your PC and have the space for it, the Sanctum 810 looks mighty fine. <em>&mdash;Ashley Biancuzzo</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"asus-rog-strix-scope-ii-96-keyboard\">Asus ROG Strix Scope II 96 keyboard</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Asus ROG Strix Scope II 96 keyboard\" class=\"wp-image-1937299\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Asus-ROG-Strix-Scope-II-96-keyboard.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Asus</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>By the time you finish saying &ldquo;<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://rog.asus.com/articles/gaming-keyboards-gaming-mice/show-your-strength-with-the-rog-strix-scope-ii-96-wireless-keyboard/&amp;xcust=2-1-1937288-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Asus ROG Strix Scope II 96 keyboard</a>&rdquo; you may well be able to buy one. Despite the long name, Asus&rsquo;s first 96 percent ROG wireless gaming keyboard packs in some very spiffy features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The keyboard&rsquo;s ROG PBT doubleshot keycaps and soft comfy wrist rest sound very appealing, but the main jam for most gamers will be the hot-swappable, mechanical ROG NX Snow Switches. ROG&rsquo;s latest mechanical switches use new composite materials on the top and bottom switch housings to dampen sound. But they also have factory-applied lubrication for smooth linear keystrokes and &ldquo;thocky&rdquo; acoustics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the real draw for me is the keyboard&rsquo;s Tri-Mode connectivity with ROG Omni Receiver. I&rsquo;m hoping the latter will mean I can forget worrying about USB passthrough. While the Tri-Mode connectivity gives you three connection types&mdash;2.4GHz RF wireless, Bluetooth (up to three devices simultaneously) and a USB connection&mdash;the ROG Omni Receiver allows you to connect three devices wirelessly using a single USB dongle and &ldquo;without compromising performance.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The keyboard layout looks promising too, offering all the functionality of a full-sized keyboard, but with bonuses like rad hotkeys preprogrammed for Xbox Game Bar and recording. <em>&mdash;Dominic Bayley</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"msi-mag-a850gl-power-supply-and-its-yellow-12vhpwr-cables\">MSI MAG A850GL power supply (and its yellow 12VHPWR cables)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s the simple things in life that always amaze you.

While some people still resist the 12VHPWR cable, the ship as sailed, and the MSI MAG A850GL&rsquo;s simple yellow cables could go a long way toward helping people avoid problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"cooler-master-motion-1-haptic-gaming-chair\">Cooler Master Motion 1 haptic gaming chair</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Say hello to a new frontier for immersive gaming. <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1935999/cooler-masters-motion-1-haptic-gaming-chair-gets-your-body-in-the-game.html\">Motion 1, a &ldquo;haptic engine gaming chair&rdquo; collaboration</a> between Cooler Master and D-Box, aims to get your whole body in the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It uses more than 65,000 haptic effects such as movements, waves, vibrations, and textures. All of these supposedly combine to simulate the entertainment you&rsquo;re experiencing on screen. And just in case you&rsquo;re concerned about ergonomics, the Motion 1 includes magnetic lumbar support and a headrest as well. So at least you can save your actual body even if your in-game body gets pulverized in the virtual world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The chair is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.cmodx.com/motion-1&amp;xcust=2-1-1937288-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">already up for pre-order</a>&nbsp;on Cooler Master&rsquo;s CMODX website retailing for $2,229.00. That&rsquo;s more than the Herman Miller Aeron ergonomic wonder-chair so you&rsquo;ll need to really be invested in the haptic technology to justify the expense. But at the end of the day gaming is about having fun, and a chair that makes the experience more immersive looks like a hell of a lot of fun. <em>&mdash;Sam Singleton</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"pc-components-in-actual-colors\">PC components in actual colors!</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Thermaltake toughliquid AIO turquoise \" class=\"wp-image-1937535\" height=\"614\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/thermaltake-toughliquid-240-argb-sync-turquoise.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1024\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Thermaltake</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>For the longest time, PC components have been limited in color. You&rsquo;ll see lots of black, and sometimes (but not always) some white and silver as well. Computer cases get more variety, with occasional options in wild shades like blue or red. (Ahem.) Inside the case? It can be work to find enough worthy components to do an all-white build, much less one with fun color accents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But at Computex 2023, vendors are branching out, and it&rsquo;s wonderful. We saw multiple cases sporting mid-century modern hues, with <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://computex.thermaltake.com/2023/cooler.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1937288-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thermaltake even offering matching AIO coolers</a>. Think pale turquoise, matcha green, forest green, and pastel pink&mdash;shades that can really pop against a white build, or add a subtle flavor to a black one. (A dark forest green AIO in an otherwise all-black PC? Yes, please.) Fingers crossed that this becomes a lasting trend&mdash;and one that brings even more colors into play. <em>&mdash;Alaina Yee</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"cooler-master-qube-500-flatpack\">Cooler Master Qube 500 Flatpack</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Cooler Master Qube 500 Flatpack case color options\" class=\"wp-image-1935910\" height=\"799\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/coolermasterqube500flatpack.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>Worried about dust?

Cooler Master is capturing that same vibe with its <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1935899/1935899.html\">Qube 500 Flatpack case</a>, which comes deconstructed. You put it together yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The novelty of the design is compelling, especially since this fully modular case is simple yet flexible in both configuration and aesthetics. This 33L mini-tower can fit plenty of hardware inside&mdash;an E-ATX motherboard, a CPU cooler up to 172mm in height, a GPU as long as 365mm, a 280mm radiator, and up to three 3.5-inch drives. Not everything will fit at the same time, of course, but a lot will.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also swap the included panels for other colors, and the options include several fun shades. There&rsquo;s a bright yellow (aka &ldquo;Bumblebee&rdquo;), and then three dessert-colored pastel hues (mint, pink, and cream). With this mix of good looks and smart design, the Qube 500 could go a long way in popularity, especially with the company&rsquo;s encouragement of 3D-printed accessories. If it kicks off a new trend when it launches on September 15, I won&rsquo;t be surprised. <em>&mdash;Alaina Yee</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"cooler-master-sneaker-x\">Cooler Master Sneaker X</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Cooler Master Sneaker X\" class=\"wp-image-1935753\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Sneaker-X-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Cooler Master</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s everything you need to house a high-end gaming rig but <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1935746/wow-this-high-end-gaming-pc-looks-like-an-actual-sneaker.html\">it looks like a gigantic sneaker</a>.
