This video is part of everyday anal sex education as outlined in the <a href=\"https://www.cde.ca.gov/ls/he/se/index.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">California Healthy Youth Act</a>. It is about the birds and the bees and all that sodomy.</p><blockquote>You don't have to go inside the booty hole you can actually just push on the seam and that stimulates the prostate gland. They...</blockquote><p>Right. \"They.\"</p><blockquote>...apparently really like that. So that's why, for male and male, anal sex is still very pleasurable because of the fact that it hits the prostate and there's a lot of nerve endings in your booty, as well.</blockquote><p>And if you still have trouble stimulating your prostate, they sell toys to help you at Target. But you have to go to where they sell tampons and maxi-pads. The anal sex toys haven't been moved to the children's toy aisle. Yet. After all, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/target-pride-collection\" target=\"_blank\">this is Target</a> and <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/cvs-toy-aisle\" target=\"_blank\">not your neighborhood CVS</a>.</p><p>The state education laws requiring such graphic discussion of anal sex were passed by the state of California in 2019. El Dorado High School is in Orange County, California. The OC voted for Democrat Joe Biden 53% to 44% in 2020.</p><p>It's the beginning of June and we need to pace ourselves. Instead of expressing the obvious disgust over what progressives have been allowed to turn our public schools into, I'll close by advising that if you share that disgust, stop voting for the people who promote it.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

\"fastest girl in Connecticut\" wound up losing more than 20 races in High School when Connecticut state law allowed medicore male runners to compete against girls if those boy decided they identified as girls. Mitchell is suing he state to get the law changed to allow other female athletes the opportunity to perform on a level playfield.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/finally-girls-sue-to-block-transgender-women-from-competing-in-girls-sports\" target=\"_blank\">The lawsuit was filed in 2020</a>. It's getting revisited thanks to a new interview with Mitchell from <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2023/05/31/runner-chelsea-mitchell-who-lost-to-trans-athletes-this-is-about-fairness/\" target=\"_blank\">the New York Post</a>. As an example of how much more ridiculous the issue has gotten since then, we now have <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/skateboarder-speaks-girls-competition\" target=\"_blank\">27-year-old \"women\" stealing opportunities from 13-year-old girls and bragging about it</a>.</p><p>It was during Mitchell's first statewide track meet as a high school sophomore that she discovered boys could compete against girls if those boys said they were girls. First and second place that year were taken by two of those girls who were born boys but said they were girls.</p><blockquote>It was just obvious to everyone there that they had a huge advantage. Everyone could see it.</blockquote><p>Chelsea ran in the 55-meter dash. <a href=\"https://www.athletic.net/TrackandField/Division/Event.aspx?DivID=93644&amp;Event=41&amp;type=4\" target=\"_blank\">The boys' record for it is 6.26</a>. The girls' record is a 6.77, which wouldn't rank her in the top ten for boys'. Though if you need more of a visual aid, this is the thumbnail for our 2020 post when the lawsuit was first filed.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"59922\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=33781715&amp;width=980\" />\n</p>\n<p>Mitchell goes on to tell the post:</p><blockquote>Just two athletes took so many opportunities away from biological females. Even though there were only two of them, they took 15 state championships away from other girls \u2014 and there were 85 girls that were directly impacted from them being in the races.</blockquote><p>Mitchell had attempted to share her story in 2021 in USA Today. Activists forced the paper to edit her OpEd because she referred to males as \"male.\"</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/USATODAY?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@USATODAY</a> published our client Chelsea Mitchell\u2019s opinion about the unfairness she experienced being forced to compete against male athletes. But after backlash from the woke mob, editors unilaterally changed Chelsea\u2019s words & called them \u201churtful language.\u201d 1/3 <a href=\"https://t.co/tAtzrZgPzt\">pic.twitter.com/tAtzrZgPzt</a><br />\u2014 Christiana (Holcomb) Kiefer (@ChristianaADF) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChristianaADF/status/1397610845761425410?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 26, 2021</a></blockquote> </div><p>Mitchell now wants to help other girls, especially now that the issue has gotten a lot worse. In 2020, this happened under a Republican president who should have taken the issue seriously. Now under Democrat president Joe Biden, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/espn-sam-ponder-lia-thomas\" target=\"_blank\">they want to change the rules to allow MORE boys who claim to be girls to compete against girls</a>. Effectively robbing these girls of so many opportunities to learn, grow, and develop through sports. The same opportunities WIll Thomas was afforded before he transitioned to Lia and went from being a mediocre male swimmer to an NCAA champion female swimmer.</p><p>A three-judge panel of the Second Circuit ruled against Mitchell's case in December. On June 6th, the argument is being reheard before the full Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York City. I'm afraid the words \"New York City\" gives away the eventual outcome. But maybe the three-judge panel will vote to be on the right side of history instead.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

Yet there is no \"proof.\" And as an example of how difficult it is to get \"proof,\" Elon Musk just revealed a line of code that's been throttling tweets since 2012.</p><p>Elon made the revelation during an interview with The Babylon Bee.

And I'm not even sure what can be done. But if Twitter just found one line of code that has been severely throttling tweets for eleven years -- three presidential elections ago -- how many more lines of secret code have been written since then. People who work for Big Tech have over a decade of growing more bitterly partisan and more outspoken about blocking any opposing viewpoint. </p><p>And this is a platform that less than a quarter of America uses. OVER SEVENTY PERCENT of America uses Facebook, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2022/10/31/social-media-disinformation-dhs/\" target=\"_blank\">who created a portal so the federal government could block posts</a> the federal government deemed \"misinformation.\"</p><p>That was blatant. How easy is it for a single coder to sneak a single line of code into these platforms to throttle THEIR political opponents?
