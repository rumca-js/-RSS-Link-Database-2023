► Lyrics “Nefarious” ◄

Set me ablaze 

Another day your vain injustice reigns 
You’ve held us down so long, entrapped us in your siren song 
I’ve found a way to face this corrupt place 
Not holding back this time, nefarious regimes must die 
 
Set me ablaze, but don’t think I’ll just walk away 
Just walk away 
Cause I’m changing my fate 
I swore that I would make you pay, you won’t escape 
 
Now it’s too late to save your legacy 
Rain fire from above, I’m not afraid to call your bluff 
You’ll rue the day you made us enemies 
One by one, we’ll rise up, it’s safe to say we’ve had enough 
 

All your power and riches are no match for us 
Horrors you have wrought, surviving the onslaught 
Ivory towers will crumble down and turn to dust 
Is that all you’ve got? Now it’s your turn to rot 
 
Set me ablaze, but don’t think I’ll just walk away 
Just walk away 
Cause I’m changing my fate 
I swore that I would make you pay, you won’t escape 
 
Say your goodbyes 
Shrouded in lies, you’ll face this damnation 
Fall from the sky 
Drenched in your vile intentions, know my vengeance 
You’ll know my vengeance 
 
Wash away those lines in the sand 
Count your days, this is who I am 
 
Set me ablaze, but don’t think I’ll just walk away 
Just walk away 
Cause I’m changing my fate 
I swore that I would make you pay, you won’t escape 
 
Godslap
