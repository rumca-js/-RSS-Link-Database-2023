## The Guardian view on the Covid-19 standoff: it’s a matter for the inquiry | Editorial

<p>Lady Hallett should be able to decide what is relevant in Boris Johnson’s papers – not the Cabinet Office</p><p>As with everything else involving Boris Johnson, theatricality looms large in the dispute over whether his WhatsApps, diaries and notebooks should be released without redaction to the official Covid-19 inquiry. The Cabinet Office had until 4pm on Thursday to comply with <a href="https://covid19.public-inquiry.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/24141256/2023-04-28-Section-21-Notice-for-the-Cabinet-Office.pdf" title="">a demand</a> from the inquiry chair, Lady Hallett, to hand them all over. After the deadline passed, the standoff soon morphed into a high-stakes <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/01/government-to-launch-legal-action-in-attempt-to-retain-johnson-whatsapps" title="">court challenge</a> by ministers. Apart from anything else, this means further delays to an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/30/covid-inquiry-whatsapp-messages-boris-johnson" title="">already slow inquiry</a> process.</p><p>This dispute could have been seen coming. Ever since Lady Hallett was appointed in 2021 to conduct what Mr Johnson called “a forensic and thoroughgoing” inquiry into the UK’s response to the pandemic, it was blindingly clear that she would need to see all the evidence about the government’s handling. Since Lady Hallett was appointed under the Inquiries Act 2005, it was also clear that she had the powers to compel witnesses and evidence. Her ​moral ​position was strengthened further this week when Mr Johnson <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/31/boris-johnson-says-his-whatsapps-and-notes-can-be-given-to-covid-inquiry" title="">handed</a> all his papers to the Cabinet Office and said they should be passed to the inquiry.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/01/the-guardian-view-on-the-covid-19-standoff-its-a-matter-for-the-inquiry">Continue reading...</a>

## The Guardian view on the snap Spanish election: Europe needs Sánchez’s gamble to pay off | Editorial

<p>This summer, Spain could become the latest country to feature a radical right presence in government</p><p>Spain’s socialist prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has a reputation for judicious risk-taking. In 2018, after orchestrating a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/01/mariano-rajoy-ousted-as-spain-prime-minister" title="">vote of no confidence</a> in the incumbent centre-right government, he was appointed prime minister despite the socialists having a mere 84 MPs in a 350-seat parliament. Mr Sánchez was not even a sitting deputy at the time.</p><p>This July, progressives both inside and outside Spain must hope that the prime minister’s gambling instincts will pay off once again. Following regional and municipal polls in which the centre-right Partido Popular (PP) had a field day, and the radical right Vox party doubled its share of the vote, Mr Sánchez has surprised Spain by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/29/spain-pm-calls-snap-election-after-opposition-and-far-right-wins-in-local-polls-pedro-sanchez" title="">calling</a> a snap general election on 23 July, anticipating one due in December. This is a manoeuvre that Sir Humphrey in Yes Minister might describe as “brave”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/01/the-guardian-view-on-the-snap-spanish-election-europe-needs-sanchezs-gamble-to-pay-off">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With the writer’s latest big screen adaptation The Boogeyman opening in theatres, we select the best interpretations of his work</p><p>Based on King’s own wrestle with outraged fans struggling to accept his swerve away from books solely within the horror genre, Misery is another story that also exists outside of what we might typically expect from him. It’s a darkly comic thriller devoid of nefarious supernatural elements that instead weaponises a woman’s extreme loneliness and even more extreme entitlement to tell one of cinema’s most effective, and evergreen, stories of unhinged fandom. A perfectly calibrated Kathy Bates, who remains the only Oscar winner for a King movie to date, alternates her romance novel-fixated antagonist Annie between sweet and sour from scene to scene, William Goldman’s canny script adding more complicated emotional texture to what could have descended into cheap hagsploitation. Her seat-edge interplay with a never-better James Caan is a truly terrifying battle of wits, crescendoing in a scene of unforgettably well-orchestrated violence, a “hobbling” made even more horrifying by her profession of love directly after. Pop culture might have shifted since Annie’s paperback obsession but the intensity of fan culture remains just as scary. <em>Benjamin Lee</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/01/best-stephen-king-movies-the-shining-carrie">Continue reading...</a>

## Diablo 4 review – a hell of a good time?

<p><strong>PlayStation 4/5, Xbox, PC; Blizzard Entertainment</strong> <br />Behind the screams and stunningly-costumed demons, this is escapist junk food for gamers – which may be exactly what you’re after</p><p>Diablo 4 wants you to know that it’s very serious indeed. From its gripping introduction, evoking Blizzard’s Warcraft 3-era heyday of best-in-class cinematics, to the richly macabre backdrops that host its continuous loop of demon-slaying ultraviolence, this is a game with a mission statement: please don’t make fun of us for being too cartoonish, <a href="https://www.mtv.com/news/8rnjez/diablo-iii-art-direction">like you did with Diablo 3</a>.</p><p>It’s done well, for the most part. The writing harkens back to Diablo’s original two outings; a gothic, low fantasy miasma of hopelessness and intrigue. Most impressively, this version of Diablo’s world feels, well, like a world again; a place with history and tension, rather than a collection of maps strung together to facilitate dungeon delving.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jun/01/diablo-4-review-a-hell-of-a-good-time">Continue reading...</a>

## The debt ceiling fight was never about debt. It was about Republican power | Mark Weisbrot

<p><strong>(Roswell/RCA)</strong><br />On the veteran band’s first album since drummer – and Dave Grohl’s best friend – Taylor Hawkins’ death, every anguished, searching and sometimes triumphant song is about death</p><p>In 1995, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/22/swagger-power-and-all-star-cameos-foo-fighters-roar-back-with-new-drummer">Foo Fighters</a> released their eponymous debut album, recorded by Dave Grohl alone the previous year in the months after Kurt Cobain’s suicide. The contemporary press was revealing: the album was not greeted with the universal warmth one might have expected. Interviewers and critics seemed to be suspicious and combative. There was a consensus that the album was selling well due to residual affection for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/nirvana">Nirvana</a>, or as a kind of mass sympathy vote; that either way, it was unlikely to be a project with legs. One frequent line of questioning involved picking over its lyrics for references to his former band and its late frontman, despite Grohl’s repeated insistence that almost all the songs predated Cobain’s death and that the album was not an act of posthumous reflection or mourning – whatever grieving he had to do was done in private.</p><p>How times change. Twenty-eight years later, Foo Fighters are enshrined as a dependable rock institution. Dave Grohl’s charm and affability mean his name seldom appears in print unaccompanied by the phrase Nicest Guy in Rock; his image long uncoupled itself from the darkness and angst that consumed Nirvana. And the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/26/taylor-hawkins-death-foo-fighters">death in 2022 of Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins</a> was marked with very public grieving: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/sep/04/taylor-hawkins-tribute-concert-review-stars-unite-to-honour-the-late-foo-fighters-drummer">tribute concerts in LA and London</a> – billed by Grohl as “gigantic fucking nights for a gigantic fucking person” – their bills featuring everyone from Rush to Liam Gallagher to Miley Cyrus, their conclusion emotionally charged performances by Foo Fighters themselves, Grohl fighting back tears as he sang.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/01/foo-fighters-but-here-we-are-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Northern Stage, Newcastle upon Tyne<br /></strong>Politicians’ glib statements frame the struggles of one man confounded by a bewildering welfare system, in an adaptation of the Ken Loach film that both moves and provokes</p><p>It is as if this adaptation of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/12/i-daniel-blake-ken-loachs-welfare-state-polemic-is-blunt-dignified-and-brutally-moving">Ken Loach movie</a> has been suspended between quotation marks. Topping and tailing Mark Calvert’s heartfelt production is the claim by Damian Green, former secretary of state for work and pensions, that I, Daniel Blake was a “<a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/damian-green-never-seen-i-9166462">work of fiction</a>”.

The story of a decent man laid off because of heart problems, only to find a support system purpose-built to make his life difficult, is interspersed with verbatim remarks by politicians from George Osborne to Liz Truss.

<p>Cats show their feelings from whiskers to tail. Here is how to read their body language and boost their health and happiness</p><p>Shortly after my partner and I adopted our two cats, our fluffy black one, Mambo, decided that I am his special human. Mambo rarely lets anyone else pet him, but he follows me everywhere, trilling to greet me, rubbing his cheek on my hand, sitting on my stuff or watching me work. He also loves it when I bring out his puzzle toys and treats for games. I did not expect to get this much attention from a cat, so I joked with friends that Mambo was behaving like a dog. But, when my cat behaviourist friend told me, “No, he is behaving like a CAT!” I decided to find out more.</p><p>As a new cat owner, I started questioning the popular belief that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/08/the-inner-lives-of-cats-what-our-feline-friends-really-think-about-hugs-happiness-and-humans">cats are less sociable</a> and trainable than dogs.

<p>Across the UK, fossil fuel companies’ broken promises have left scarred and polluted landscapes, and no one held accountable</p><p>When you’re in a hole, keep digging. This is the strategy of opencast miners across the world: our past debts and future liabilities can one day be discharged if only we’re allowed to dig a little deeper and extract a little more. And public authorities keep falling for it.</p><p>The UK’s biggest opencast coalmine, Ffos-y-Fran in south Wales, was granted permission in 2005 on the grounds that it would rehabilitate a hill, on the outskirts of Merthyr Tydfil, which had been made dangerous by the shafts and spoil heaps left by deep mining. It wasn’t called a coalmine, but a “land reclamation scheme”. If the reclaimers happened to stumble across 11m tonnes of coal while improving the land by digging a 400-hectare (1,000-acre) pit, 200 metres deep, who could blame them for taking it?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/01/fossil-fuel-toxic-legacy-coal-wales-mining">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Al Pacino will become a father again at 83. Robert De Niro, 79, just had his seventh child. What’s the endgame for this fantastic actors’ smackdown? </p><p>Al Pacino and Robert De Niro are forever destined to be intertwined. The two greatest actors of their generation – the two greatest actors of most generations – Pacino and De Niro will spend the rest of eternity being compared. People will tie themselves up in knots over who did the best work, who was the best in The Godfather Part II, who won their first scene together in Heat, who was the least bad in Righteous Kill.</p><p>And now the comparisons have started to spill out from their professional efforts. A couple of weeks ago Twitter blew a gasket trying to work out whether Al Pacino was sexier than Robert De Niro. The competition between them is fierce, and never lets up.

## Two-child limit on UK welfare benefits ‘has failed to push parents into jobs’

<p><strong>Exclusive</strong>: Policy misunderstands realities of caring roles and has left hundreds of thousands of families in poverty, study finds</p><p>The UK’s controversial two-child benefit limit, which restricts welfare payments to larger families in an attempt to force parents to get a job, has failed to increase employment levels – but it has left hundreds of thousands of households in poverty, according to the first study of its kind.</p><p>The government introduced the two-child limit in 2017, arguing that removing eligibility for benefits worth £3,000 a year per child for a family’s third and subsequent children would “incentivise” parents to move into work, or work more hours to make up the difference.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/01/two-child-limit-on-uk-welfare-benefits-has-failed-to-push-parents-into-jobs">Continue reading...</a>

## Roger Waters review – a powerful, humanist spectacular

<p><strong>Utilita Arena, Birmingham</strong><br />Arriving after accusations of antisemitism in Germany, Waters tells crowd ‘I will not be cancelled’ – but edits out clumsy elements to leave a stronger show</p><p>‘If you’re one of those ‘I love Pink Floyd but I can’t stand Roger’s politics’ people, then you might do well to fuck off to the bar,” announces the singer via a recorded message before the show. There isn’t a mass stampede, although the “can’t stand Roger’s politics” people have certainly been vocal lately. He’s been called an antisemite and “Putin apologist” by Polly Samson , wife of ex-bandmate David Gilmour, who gave her tweet his approval. Waters has condemned the invasion of Ukraine but been denounced in the country for also saying it <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/08/roger-waters-pink-floyd-un-security-council-ukraine-russia">“was not unprovoked”</a>, views which led to Polish concerts being cancelled. He won a legal battle to perform in Frankfurt after more accusations of antisemitism (which he denies). Last week it was reported that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/26/berlin-police-investigate-roger-waters-nazi-style-uniform-pink-floyd-concert">German police are investigating him over a “Nazi-style” costume</a> worn on stage in Berlin.</p><p>Here, Waters tackles all this head-on. A screened statement points out that a satirical “depiction of an unhinged fascist demagogue” has been part of his shows since The Wall in 1980 and that his father was killed fighting the Nazis. Then he launches into a 10-minute tirade in which he decries his “brutal” treatment in Germany and says that the Daily Mail, the Times and the Daily Telegraph are trying to destroy him over his support for human rights in Palestine. “They’re trying to cancel me like they cancelled Jeremy Corbyn and Julian Assange,” he rages. “I will not be cancelled.” By the time he thanks the crowd for their support, the 79-year-old is tearful. “I’m fucking dying here,” he pleads.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/01/roger-waters-review-a-powerful-humanist-spectacular">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Using chemicals in the environment can save wildlife from deadly pathogens, but process is not without risks, say experts</p><p>Joseph Hoyt and his team first showed up to the abandoned mineshaft in Wisconsin during the late summer of 2017, personal protective equipment in hand. Long before Covid-19, the supplies were to protect them from the chlorine dioxide gas they had brought along. Their aim was to use the disinfectant gas to kill the <em>Pseudogymnoascus destructans</em> fungus lining the walls of the mineshaft, which had <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/news/national-news-release/how-does-white-nose-syndrome-kill-bats">already killed millions</a> of bats across North America.</p><p>“You’re talking about essentially an entire taxonomic group that has been reduced by over 90% – it’s like the equivalent of losing all birds or something like that,” says Hoyt, an assistant professor in disease ecology at Virginia Tech University.

<p>A gossipy, insightful survey of the (often closeted) gay contribution to American theatre</p><p>It may seem strange given theatre’s reputation for sexual licence, but in the 20th century, gay men and lesbians on Broadway had to spend most of their careers in the closet.

Don’t believe me? Make a list of the others. Hint: you won’t need both sides of the paper. Correction: you won’t need paper.</p><p>Gays on Broadway, the latest book – he has written more than 50 – by cultural critic and novelist Ethan Mordden, is a whistle-stop historical tour. It begins at the turn of the 20th century and culminates with Tesori and Lisa Kron’s musical Fun Home and the 2019 Broadway production of The Inheritance, Matthew Lopez’s six-and-a-half-hour gay revamp of Howards End (depending on your viewpoint, either deeply moving or Howards Endless).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/01/gays-on-broadway-by-ethan-mordden-review-stage-whispers">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Alexios and Leandro worked on a Greek summer camp, discovered a shared sense of humour and have been best friends ever since</p><p>Growing up in Greece, Alexios attended the same summer camp in Thessaloniki every year. In 2011, when he was 17, he became a camp counsellor. “I was in charge of the activities like sports and swimming,” he says. It wasn’t long before he became best friends with Leandro, a fellow camp counsellor, the same age as him. Leandro says: “I was living in Bulgaria at the time, because of my father’s job, but I’d also grown up in Greece and gone to the camp every year. It had a private beach and a beautiful hill covered in pines. It was a great experience to return to.”</p><p>At camp, Alexios quickly noticed how popular Leandro was. “Everyone wanted to be his friend,” he says. “One day, I went to his tent to say hello. We ended up listening to music together and it all started from there.” The friendship clicked straight away and the pair soon became inseparable. “Other camp counsellors seemed more reserved, but Alexios was very honest and open,” says Leandro. “It was just so instant. It made it really easy to build a friendship.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/01/how-we-met-everyone-thought-we-were-dating-its-rare-for-two-men-to-be-so-close">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘I’m terrified’: Nightdive Studios’s boss on remaking System Shock

<p>CEO Stephen Kick tells the eight-year story of his firm’s ambitious reboot of a lost sci-fi horror gaming classic</p><p>“Anxious. Excited. Terrified.” That’s how Stephen Kick, chief executive of Nightdive Studios, was feeling when I spoke to him last week, before the launch of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/may/30/system-shock-remake-review-pc">System Shock</a>. A remake of the 1994 cyberpunk shooter that inspired lauded games from Bioshock to Deus Ex and Dead Space, System Shock was announced in 2015, but was delayed again and again; at one point it was started again from scratch. So Kick is justifiably nervous. “We don’t yet know how this is going to be received,” he says. “Because it took so long … financially, it was the most expensive project that we’ve ever done.”</p><p>Happily for Nightdive Studios, when System Shock was released this week, it became an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?filter=topsellers">instant top seller</a> – and critics <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/may/30/system-shock-remake-review-pc">liked it</a>, too. But this was never a sure thing. Even though video game remakes are enormously popular, as demonstrated by the success of this year’s reimagining of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/mar/17/resident-evil-4-remake-review-beautiful-tense-camp-gory-all-thats-best-about-the-series">Resident Evil 4</a>, spending eight years rebuilding another studio’s game is a considerable commitment. For Kick and Nightdive, System Shock is more than just money-spinning digital necromancy. It is one of the reasons for the studio’s existence.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jun/01/im-terrified-nightdive-studioss-boss-on-remaking-system-shock-2">Continue reading...</a>

## Ignore any lofty claims about the Bollywood hit The Kerala Story: this film will only incite hatred against Muslims | Asim Ali

<p>The controversial film championed by the BJP is an Islamophobic fantasy</p><p>Two weeks after I was born in the curfewed town of Aligarh, in Uttar Pradesh, the Aligarh riots of 1990 broke out. What began as skirmishes exploded into widespread bloodletting after <a href="https://jsis.washington.edu/southasia/publication/the-production-of-hindu-muslim-violence-in-contemporary-india/">three leading</a> Hindi daily newspapers published front-page headlines reporting the targeted killing of Hindus inside a hospital run by Muslims. Those killings turned out to be the <a href="https://jsis.washington.edu/southasia/publication/the-production-of-hindu-muslim-violence-in-contemporary-india/">fevered imaginings</a> of two Hindu “eyewitnesses”. But the actual <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/10/world/muslim-hindu-riots-in-india-leave-93-dead-in-3-days.html">massacres</a> ignited by this fake news eventually left about a hundred people <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/10/world/muslim-hindu-riots-in-india-leave-93-dead-in-3-days.html">dead</a>, the vast majority of them Muslims.</p><p>A fortnight ago, I watched the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/09/india-police-investigating-film-portrays-kerala-islamic-terrorism-hub">new Bollywood hit The Kerala Story</a>, in a rundown cinema in Delhi. The sluggish air conditioning seemed to have given up against the sultry May heat. A group of (largely) young Hindu men packed out the theatre. Occasionally, they broke out into passionate chants of “Jai Shri Ram”, the cry that often accompanies videos of “vigilante violence” committed against Muslims. Yet when they streamed out of the theatre, they looked more horrified than enraged, like sports fans numbed after their side has taken one beating after another. The rolling spectacle of an all-round “Hindu humiliation” – including graphic scenes depicting Hindu women being violently raped by Muslims – had lasted for more than two hours.</p><p>Asim Ali is an independent political researcher and columnist based in Delhi</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/01/bollywood-hit-kerala-story-islamophobic-bjp">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Netflix’s recreation of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster is disappointingly insight free. It’s obsessed with facts to the point where it neglects both character and story</p><p>It feels borderline immoral to criticise The Days, a serenely measured and thorough dramatisation of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster and its aftermath. The resourcefulness and courage of the men on duty at the power station at the hideous moment when calamity struck, who stayed for a week afterwards working to avoid a much worse catastrophe, deserves our deep respect. But as a drama, The Days is too respectful: its desire not to leave anything out might result in tired viewers abandoning their posts.</p><p>One of the most powerful earthquakes in recorded history took place under the sea off Japan’s east coast on 11 March 2011, rupturing the mains electricity supply to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. When a subsequent tsunami flooded the station – situated only 10 metres above sea level – it nullified the site’s emergency diesel generators. Now completely without power, the plant’s reactors could no longer be cooled – only an improvised damage limitation exercise would avoid a total meltdown.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/01/the-days-review-this-nuclear-disaster-drama-is-no-chernobyl">Continue reading...</a>

## Elizabeth Holmes’ big con deserved prison time – so why do I feel sorry for her?  | Emma Brockes

<p>Seeing the former founder of Theranos turn herself in should have offered the thrill of schadenfreude. Instead I felt sympathy</p><p>It is an image that, for any number of vilified public figures, is supposed to offer the audience a measure of closure: a version of the perp walk to the front door of the jail. On Tuesday, Elizabeth Holmes, erstwhile founder of the blood testing startup, Theranos, self-presented to a federal prison in Texas to begin her <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/30/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-prison-sentence-start">11-year sentence for fraud</a>. So much about Holmes has turned out to be phoney that, on looking at the photos and feeling the first peckings of sympathy, I instantly checked myself to see where I was being manipulated.</p><p>Still, a measure of sympathy remained. Holmes was dressed in jeans and a sweater, her black turtle-neck long retired along with the contrived pitch of her voice. It is always curious in these circumstances to consider what the fraudster tells herself has actually happened, how far into denial the internal narrative goes. On the evidence of her own testimony and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/07/business/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-interview.html">interview Holmes gave to the New York Times </a>last month, she is deeply invested in the story of her own victimisation, both by her former business partner and boyfriend, Sunny Balwani, currently serving his own <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/07/former-theranos-exec-sunny-balwani-prison-sentence">almost 13-year sentence</a>, and by Silicon Valley itself.

## ‘I felt extreme confusion: was I one or two people?’: Katie Cuddon’s sculptural explorations of motherhood

<p>Fired up by the experience of raising a child in the pandemic, the sculptor discusses her latest works exploring the ‘incredibly physical’ relationship between mother and baby</p><p>The “mother” has retreated with her child to an old kitchen chair. Her body has become a vessel, pink as new skin, comforting as a hot-water bottle. Yet something is a little off. She doesn’t exactly nestle the rolled-up blanket that is her “baby”. Although tied by a harness strap, this infant sits atop the mother like an awkward offering. As the mother’s head tips back in what might be ecstasy, exhaustion or simply for a glimpse of the world beyond, it turns out she has no face – her neck ends in a dark opening, a void.</p><p>For the sculptor Katie Cuddon, that emptiness is an “element of horror” within Night Portraits, her new exhibition of clay works exploring early motherhood in its bodily and psychological contradictions and complexity. “My work comes from feelings that inhabit the body and take it over,” says the artist, who became a mother in 2018. “The relationship you have with a small child is incredibly physical. I felt extreme emotions and confusion: was I one or two people? It’s a really interesting place to think about sculpture from” – how the experience of motherhood can turn “coordinates of space and time on their heads.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/01/katie-cuddon-sculptural-explorations-of-motherhood">Continue reading...</a>

<p>George Orwell’s voice comes alive again in a biography drawing on newly discovered letters</p><p>Though he worked for the BBC for two and a half years and often spoke on air, no recording of George Orwell’s voice has been found. Many friends and memoirists have described it, and his struggles to make himself audible (all the more so after a sniper’s bullet went through his throat in Spain), but their accounts vary: was his voice high-pitched or husky, old Etonian or a Cockney drawl? DJ Taylor settles for calling it deadpan, but its elusiveness seems apt.</p><p>Orwell was one of the great voices of the 20th century. But the voice of the early novels isn’t the voice of Animal Farm or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/1949/jun/10/georgeorwell.classics">Nineteen Eighty-Four</a>. And the voice of the reporter, down and out among Kentish hop-pickers or Grimethorpe miners, isn’t the voice of Tribune’s “As I Please” columnist. As Taylor rightly says, Orwell remains an indispensable reference point today, whether the topic is CCTV, ID cards, cancel culture or Ukraine.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/01/orwell-by-dj-taylor-review-a-very-english-socialist">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As adults, we are taught to keep a lid on our emotions. It has left me longing for the days of relentless, unbridled mirth</p><p>A cute video of a baby laughing its head off has been doing the rounds on Twitter this week. He is sitting in a cardboard box as it’s dragged along by the family dog. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (Rospa) may frown at such a caper, but their concerns wouldn’t bother this bairn, for the lad’s quite helpless with mirth. Naturally, his joy is infectious.</p><p>When I was not much older than a baby, I was obsessed with Led Zeppelin. In the live recording of Stairway to Heaven at Madison Square Garden in 1973, Robert Plant follows up the lyric about forests echoing with laughter with a question for the crowd: “Does anyone remember laughter?” he enquires plaintively. Even as a devotee of his work, I remember thinking this plea a bit on the dismal side. But now, looking at the delight of the baby in the box, I find myself asking a similar question: does anyone remember laughing like that?

<p>G7 sought deterrence without escalating new cold war but Beijing responded with rage</p><p>After the May G7 summit in Hiroshima, the US president, Joe Biden, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/22/us/politics/biden-china-g7.html">claimed</a> that he expected a “thaw” in relations with China.

<p>The father and son DJ duo have become viral sensations for their guerrilla raves. Now working with brands and major labels, can they keep their countercultural spirit alive?</p><p>In a public square in Dalston, east London, out the back of the kind of bog-standard white van more used to transporting fitted kitchens or cleaning supplies, a crowd of ravers are in a jubilant mood, all sweat-sheen and wide smiles. Inside the van DJs spin tunes characteristic of this itinerant party, dubbed <a href="https://www.instagram.com/homebassuk/?hl=en">HomeBass</a>: garage, jungle, drum’n’bass. It begins to rain but they remain in place, arms upraised, waiting for the first drop from rising jungle star Nia Archives.</p><p>What began with the van pulling up to forest raves during Covid – with all the legal and ethical quandaries that entailed – is now a UK dance music phenomenon. Artists of the calibre of Fatboy Slim, the Ragga Twins and Eats Everything have played out of the HomeBass van. There have been festival takeovers, thousands-strong pop-up raves and subsequent police shutdowns; Sony, MTV and Universal have enlisted HomeBass to add spice to album releases, a record label is in the works and US promoters have been in touch. This weekend they head to a secret Manchester location.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/01/homebass-the-white-van-shaking-up-uk-rave-culture">Continue reading...</a>

## Changing Ends review – Alan Carr’s childhood makes for relentlessly funny TV

<p>This semi-autobiographical sitcom is a light, self-deprecating slice of hilarity. Its tale of growing up in 1980s Northampton is camp, cheeky and clever</p><p>It would take a hard heart not to fall for Changing Ends. It is a steamroller of a comedy, open, welcoming and beaming with easy charm. Written by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/alan-carr">Alan Carr</a> and Two Doors Down’s Simon Carlyle, it tells the story of Carr’s early life in Northampton, joining him on the precipice of “big school” in 1986. Carr is not your everyday 11-year-old, with his penchant for scarves, earmuffs and Murder, She Wrote; that he ends up as a confidant of the dinner ladies, and not the football lads, is no great surprise to anyone. Still, it isn’t easy being different in the east Midlands in the 80s and young Alan has issues to deal with on all sides.</p><p>Carr himself appears as a sort of ghost of Christmas yet to come, albeit a more cheerful one, dropping in to scenes to narrate for a while, or crack jokes about the star he would become. But the show belongs to Oliver Savell, who is remarkable as the young Alan. Sometimes, on screen, you can tell when a child actor is just doing their best, but Savell is fantastic and manages to embody the real Carr without it seeming like an impersonation. He is camp, he is cheeky and he gets it just right. He deserves all the acclaim that will inevitably come.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/01/changing-ends-review-alan-carrs-childhood-makes-for-relentlessly-funny-tv">Continue reading...</a>

## The backlash: how slavery research came under fire

Before his work was even published, it would spark a bitter conflict at the university – with accusations of bullying and censorship that were quickly picked up by rightwing papers as a warning about “fanatical” scholars tarnishing Britain’s history.</p><p>Bell-Romero, originally from Australia, had recently finished a PhD at Cambridge. He was at the start of his academic career and eager to prove himself. This was the ideal post-doctoral position: a chance to dig into the university’s archives to explore faculty and alumni links to slavery, and whether these links had translated into profit for Cambridge. It was the kind of work that, Bell-Romero said, “seems boring to the layperson” – spending days immersed in dusty archives and logbooks, exploring 18th- and 19th-century financial records. But as a historian, it was thrilling. It offered a chance to make a genuinely fresh contribution to burgeoning research about Britain’s relationship to slavery.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2023/jun/01/cotton-capital-legacies-of-slavery-research-backlash-cambridge-university">Continue reading...</a>
