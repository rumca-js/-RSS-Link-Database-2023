<p>The maverick singer-songwriter answers your questions – from how she coaxed Bruce Springsteen on to her record to how she’s coping since her stroke</p><p><strong>Which of your tracks are you most proud of?</strong> <em>axolotly<br /></em>I really like Bus to Baton Rouge: the lyrics, the recording, the way it came about. I was thinking about the house my mother’s parents lived in. My grandfather was a Methodist preacher and I remember the way my grandmother would throw the coffee grounds into the garden. She made the best banana pudding. There’s a little darkness in there, too. “The sweet honeysuckle that grew all around / Were switches when we were bad” is about the narrow branches they’d use to whip us. We were told: “Pick a switch, child”, and you’d have to go into the garden and pick your instrument of torture.</p><p><strong>Your </strong><strong>1988 eponymous album</strong><strong> was released by British label Rough Trade</strong><strong>, whose other albums at the time were by the likes of </strong><strong>Easterhouse, Band of Holy Joy, the Smiths and the Woodentops</strong><strong>. How did it feel being a country singer in such company?</strong> <em>VerulamiumParkRanger<br /></em>I didn’t get the chance to meet the Pixies or any of those bands, but at the heart of what I do is rock’n’roll and punk. Hank Williams was a punk, but I have just as much in common with Shane MacGowan of the Pogues. [Rough Trade’s] Geoff Travis still comes to my shows. I had a very different experience on a major label. I told one guy I wanted the producer who did Bob Dylan’s Blonde on Blonde and he went: “Is Blonde on Blonde a band?” I hated the way they made my music sound. I went to one guy’s office in Beverly Hills and he was jumping up and down in his Gucci shoes going: “It sounds so good!” And I’m sitting there going: “It sucks. I hate it.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/01/lucinda-williams-reader-interviewer">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘One guy came into A&E because his washing machine was broken’: my life as a doctor in badly behaved Britain

<p>What with the hypochondriacs and the time-wasters, a medic’s work is never done. And let’s not forget the injured bottoms …</p><p>At school, I was quite nerdy and interested in human biology, so I decided to go into medicine. No one else in my family is a doctor, so I didn’t have any role models. At medical school, you were given a whole dead body to dissect – I heard stories of people playing cricket with limbs and skipping with intestines.</p><p>Dealing with patients every day means dealing with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/27/hypochondria-brain-mental-health-causes">a lot of hypochondria</a> – people who have minor symptoms, or absolutely nothing wrong with them, are often convinced that they are dying. One lady came into A&amp;E every day for a year – even though she would be waiting six hours or more to be seen. We have had parents who wanted to have a party, but didn’t have childcare, so dropped off their kids at A&amp;E. Another set of parents came into A&amp;E on Christmas Day to try to get batteries for their kids’ toys because the shops were closed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/01/one-guy-came-into-ae-because-his-washing-machine-was-broken-my-life-as-a-doctor-in-badly-behaved-britain">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Smart, funny and an absolute blast: Poker Face and Patricia Arquette’s High Desert are making offbeat mystery shows into television’s hottest trend. Here’s to the noir-ish caper!</p><p>You wait years for a pulpy TV series about a female sort-of private investigator who drives a classic car around the more sun-bleached parts of the United States, then Natasha Lyonne and Patricia Arquette put on their statement sunglasses in the very same year. Poker Face and High Desert have emerged as two of the more original series to debut in 2023, and both share a similarly noir-ish spirit – though their protagonists run with that in very different directions.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/17/high-desert-review-patricia-arquettes-comedy-is-so-jampacked-its-exhausting">High Desert</a> is the messier of the two mysteries. Arquette plays Peggy Newman, a formerly successful drug dealer whose business empire was busted by the FBI a decade ago. She is now a recovering addict working at a wild west theme park in Yucca Valley, California. Despite the freewheeling chaos that dogs her life, Peggy is “the asshole whisperer”, with a nose for detail and a keen eye for a con artist. Through a series of unlikely events, including a breast enhancement operation, workplace theft and a hallucinatory conversation with a cactus flower, Peggy ends up on the tail of a man who calls himself “Guru Bob” (Rupert Friend, proving himself to be a standup slapstick artist), who may be even more of a fraud than he first appears to be.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/01/drugs-and-natasha-lyonne-how-2023s-most-wildly-entertaining-tv-is-all-about-female-private-eyes-poker-face-high-desert-patricia-arquette">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The YA author’s debut collection for adults includes some fine folkloric and ‘horror-adjacent’ short stories</p><p>Moïra Fowley is the well-regarded author of three Young Adult novels, best known of which is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/ng-interactive/2015/jul/29/extract-the-accident-season-moira-fowley-doyle">The Accident Season</a>. Eyes Guts Throat Bones is her first venture into stories for adults, which came about when she abandoned writing a fourth YA novel during the pandemic to bring, in her own words, something “bloody and beautiful” screaming into the world in a “horror-adjacent” mode.</p><p>The first story, What Would You Give for a Treat Like Me, is a strong opener: a vivid, neatly executed post-apocalyptic road story with fairytale echoes. The world has been taken over by forest and a wider spirit of transformation that has somehow been set loose by the coming together of the unnamed narrator and her partner Melissa. A group of adults and children are driven forward by the need to survive. The party are consumed by sudden alteration into bullfrogs, bears, wolf cubs, rose bushes; into salt crystals or gingerbread that crumbles into sugary grains. When the couple arrive, alone, at their destination, the lost children return in their mutated forms, two of them made of mud and mulch “smelling of damp dead things, earthworms in their ears and woodlice between their teeth, eyes still shining”. Melissa seems to have known this outcome all along. “Come in little children, [she] said. Come inside.”</p><p>Eyes Guts Throat Bones is published by W&amp;N (£16.99).

<p>A relatable but ultimately unsatisfying exploration of what staring at a phone all day does to the soul</p><p>There are people who sleep with their smartphones beneath their pillows.

There are people, too, who spend the night holding their phones just as they might once have held the hands of their lovers.</p><p>Phillip Maciak recognises this scenario very well. One of the premises of Screen Time is that screens should not be seen as discrete objects, things that in times past sat in the corner of a room or on a desk. Nowadays, the functions of TV sets and record players can be accessed on phones and iPads that are small, portable, designed to make life without them almost unimaginable. Screens have become less like devices and more like implants.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/01/screen-time-by-phillip-maciak-review-why-were-hooked">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Denver or Miami? Our contributors pick the winner, key players and dark horses before the NBA’s grand finale tips off</p><p>A lot has been made of the importance of <strong>a balanced roster with continuity</strong>, but, somehow, still not enough. The Nuggets are the prime example of this: their core has been together for years, they’ve had the same coach the entire time, their role players know their roles and execute them brilliantly, and they have arguably the best player in the league in Nikola Jokić to tie it all together. <strong>CDL</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/01/nba-finals-2023-picks-denver-nuggets-miami-heat">Continue reading...</a>

The tradition stretches back over a century, and some of the most famous speeches in US history – from George C Marshall’s revealing of what would become known as the Marshall Plan to David Foster Wallace’s This Is Water – have been given to graduating students.</p><p>What’s less typical about this year, the speakers agree, is the environment the class of 2023 finds itself entering, faced with threats to democracy, the climate catastrophe, entrenched racism and a host of other crises.

<p>It’s been a fixture on British TV screens for decades – as has one of its hosts, Phillip Schofield. But now This Morning is in turmoil after he admitted to an ‘unwise, but not illegal’ workplace relationship</p><p>Daytime TV is supposed to be sunny, lighthearted and varied, and for decades ITV’s This Morning won awards for fulfilling that role. At the heart of its award-winning success, at least for the past 14 years, were Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield. TV critic <strong>Scott Bryan</strong> tells <strong>Nosheen Iqbal</strong> how they were seemingly the perfect double act to interview everyone from prime ministers to grieving parents from the This Morning sofa.</p><p>Yet recently tabloid newspapers began reporting that their much-vaunted friendship was under strain and hinting at a darker reason than the usual TV ego clash. The rumours reached a fever pitch before Schofield, 61, eventually resigned. The former children’s TV presenter later released a statement admitting to an “unwise but not illegal” affair with a much younger, much more junior colleague.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/jun/01/sofas-smiles-and-scandal-whats-going-on-at-itv-this-morning-podcast">Continue reading...</a>

By “ridiculously high standards”, I am of course referring to the quality of the show itself, not the quality of the products or employees of the Wernham Hogg paper company: a collection of nitwits led, in the Slough branch, by the awful and incorrigible David Brent – unforgettably and rather perfectly imbued by Gervais with an unrelenting stink of insufferability.</p><p>But then the US version of The Office came along, introducing the employees of the Scranton branch of another paper company, Dunder Mifflin, led by a new love-to-hate nincompoop: Steve Carell’s hilariously impetuous Michael Scott. I remember being less than wowed by its opening episodes. But then something crazy happened: the show found its groove, one season rolled into another, and – at the risk of inciting my British colleagues at the Guardian to demand my immediate removal from this masthead – I came to like it much more than the original.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</a></strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/01/the-office-australia-star-felicity-ward-amazon-prime-australian-version-could-be-great">Continue reading...</a>
