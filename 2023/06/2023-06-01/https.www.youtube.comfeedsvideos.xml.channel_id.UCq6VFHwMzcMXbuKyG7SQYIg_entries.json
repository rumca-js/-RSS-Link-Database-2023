Now it\u2019s your turn to rot \n \nSet me ablaze, but don\u2019t think I\u2019ll just walk away \nJust walk away \nCause I\u2019m changing my fate \nI swore that I would make you pay, you won\u2019t escape \n \nSay your goodbyes \nShrouded in lies, you\u2019ll face this damnation \nFall from the sky \nDrenched in your vile intentions, know my vengeance \nYou\u2019ll know my vengeance \n \nWash away those lines in the sand \nCount your days, this is who I am \n \nSet me ablaze, but don\u2019t think I\u2019ll just walk away \nJust walk away \nCause I\u2019m changing my fate \nI swore that I would make you pay, you won\u2019t escape \n \nGodslap \n\n---\n\nMonuments Links\n\n\u25ba Website https://www.thisismonuments.co/\n\u25ba Official Store https://www.thisismonuments.co/product-category/merch/\n\u25ba Instagram https://www.instagram.com/thisismonuments/\n\n\u25ba Facebook https://www.facebook.com/thisismonuments/\n\u25ba Twitter https://twitter.com/thisismonuments\n\u25ba YouTube https://www.youtube.com/user/MONUMENTSONLINE\n\u25ba Spotify https://open.spotify.com/artist/71IBhhBhtPLZ8OyVuXOw77?si=ZMR1SVL6Tn6uQZ8UGtSs4w\n\u25ba Apple Music https://music.apple.com/kz/artist/monuments/128844824\n\u25ba Twitch https://www.twitch.tv/thisismonuments\n\n\u25ba GodSlap Twitter https://twitter.com/GodSlapOfficial\n\u25ba BadEgg Twitter https://twitter.com/badeggpub\n\n---\n\n#monuments #nefarious #godslap", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyRnrq8wgfM", "date_published": "2023-06-01 18:00:27+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCq6VFHwMzcMXbuKyG7SQYIg", "title": "My New Biggest Fear", "description": "This is the greatest awful dare of All Time\nMerch https://moistglobal.com/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNMQoTatinE", "date_published": "2023-06-01 02:15:03+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
