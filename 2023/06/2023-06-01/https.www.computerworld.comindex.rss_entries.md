<p>As generative AI tools such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard continue to evolve at a breakneck pace, raising questions around trustworthiness and even human rights, experts are weighing if or how the technology can be slowed and made more safe.</p><p>In March, the nonprofit Future of Life Institute published <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3691639/tech-bigwigs-hit-the-brakes-on-ai-rollouts.html">an open letter</a> calling for a six-month pause in the development of ChatGPT, the AI-based chatbot created by Microsoft-backed OpenAI.
