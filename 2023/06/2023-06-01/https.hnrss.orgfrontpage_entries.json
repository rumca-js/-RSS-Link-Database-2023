Existing solutions are non-binding, and therefore, require constant self-discipline and vigilance to be effective. Which is ironic, considering the problem we are trying to solve, is a lack of self-discipline.<p>There exists a physical solution to this problem, in the form of a time-locked safe[1]. It\u2019s effective for reducing app usage, but it's cumbersome and inconvenient.<p>Fundamentally, what these lock-boxes do is impose a real-world cost on breaking your commitment. It\u2019s not impossible to break your commitment, but it would require destroying the lock-box, and that incurs a cost.<p>I created a digital version of this, as an app (Android-only). Commitment\u2019s are backed with cash deposits, and the phone API\u2019s are used to detect violations and enforce compliance. No self-reporting required. And it even works if the monitoring app is uninstalled, or its background service disabled.<p>An example commitment: Stop using Tinder, for the next week, or forfeit $20 to the Red Cross charity.<p>The solution also generalizes to other types of commitments:<p><pre><code>  - Commit to using an app more (e.g. meditation)\n  - Commit to visiting a location (e.g. gym)\n  - Commit to making a phone call (e.g. mom)\n</code></pre>\nIt\u2019s currently only available for Android, but I'm considering doing an IOS version as well. Hope you like it, and please share any feedback you might have in the comments!<p>[1]: <a href=\"https://www.thekitchensafe.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.thekitchensafe.com</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36152222\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36152222</a></p>\n<p>Points: 7</p>\n<p># Comments: 6</p>", "link": "https://discipline.io/", "date_published": "2023-06-01 15:12:07+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Ask HN: Who is hiring?

If you ask around in other blueteams something simple like \"How many machines you got?\" you'll always get responses like \"well, one software says 30.000, the other one 24.000 and our SNMP sensors say around 38.000...\" which is kinda ridiculous to start with. If you then ask whether or not they use log4j in any of their software they either shrug or say \"nope\" with a panicking voice, because they don't really know for sure.<p>Anyways, my solution currently is a peer-to-peer approach where the systems themselves decide to mitigate issues, propagate patches (or even vaccines for zero-days) and also share incidents that look suspicious, so the surrounding nodes can start to quarantine themselves off, for example, when something really bad happened. For this to be a reliable product I decided to ditch the whole Windows \"hooks are kinda useless\" shitshow, and went for Linux/BSD/Unizes in general first, while leveraging a mixture of golang for userspace and eBPF for kernelspace.<p>But I wouldn't be a good founder if I ignored my customers, right?<p>So my questions are now somewhat to all the cyber security professionals out there:<p>- What are your biggest pain points? Do you use yet another Elastic Search dashboard that's painful to use in practice?<p>- Do you have a reliable software inventory / SBOM?<p>- Do you have a reliable network inventory / NBOM / SaaSBOM?<p>- Do you have an SBOM for all third-party software that's only available via binaries, where you don't have the source code available?<p>- Does your anti-virus / EDR solution still require signatures or is it behaviour driven?<p>- What about golang malware (aka malware that doesn't need to call hooked APIs in the kernel and can instead just use something like purego to generate shellcode directly)?<p>- How confident are you that your CVE/NVD vulnerability database is correctly tagged? (hint: I think it's not reliable for more than 80% of entries)<p>- Do you use Linux in your infrastructure? If so, which distributions?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36149904\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36149904</a></p>\n<p>Points: 13</p>\n<p># Comments: 8</p>", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36149904", "date_published": "2023-06-01 11:51:16+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Israeli Translator Destroys ChatGPT Hebrew Translation of the Great Gatsby", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNBjTY_mRio\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNBjTY_mRio</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36149858\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36149858</a></p>\n<p>Points: 10</p>\n<p># Comments: 6</p>", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNBjTY_mRio", "date_published": "2023-06-01 11:43:23+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Industry docs reveal makers of 'forever chemicals' covered up health dangers", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2023-05-secret-industry-documents-reveal-makers.html\">https://phys.org/news/2023-05-secret-industry-documents-reveal-makers.html</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36149789\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36149789</a></p>\n<p>Points: 26</p>\n<p># Comments: 9</p>", "link": "https://phys.org/news/2023-05-secret-industry-documents-reveal-makers.html", "date_published": "2023-06-01 11:33:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Maryland License Plates Now Inadvertently Advertising Filipino Online Casino", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/4a3xe9/maryland-license-plates-now-inadvertently-advertising-filipino-online-casino\">https://www.vice.com/en/article/4a3xe9/maryland-license-plates-now-inadvertently-advertising-filipino-online-casino</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36149690\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36149690</a></p>\n<p>Points: 54</p>\n<p># Comments: 23</p>", "link": "https://www.vice.com/en/article/4a3xe9/maryland-license-plates-now-inadvertently-advertising-filipino-online-casino", "date_published": "2023-06-01 11:18:44+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Show HN: Word2vec Algorithm in ~100sloc with NumPy", "description": "<p>Here's a small demonstration of the fundamental aspects of the word-to-vec\nalgorithm.

The main criticism is that its too focused on parsing. Thats just like 5 chapters. I skipped these and went straight into the intermediate language, code generation, and optimizing chapters.<p>These chapters give a detailed account of things such as register allocation, instruction selection, and instruction scheduling. The optimizing chapters are also good.<p>im not claiming im an expert compiler person. I am not but compilers is something i want to learn and so i gave the dragon book a try and i really liked it.<p>more importantly the dragon book made me realize that compilers are mathematical systems in a way. the ast is tree and trees have mathematical properties but graphs are needed for register allocation, dataflow analysis for optimization. optimization is math problem.<p>So i think this book gave me a better understanding of the field and it made appreciate compilers.<p>i'd say if youre interested in compilers you can start with \"essence of compilation\" by dr. siek and get some experience writing compilers and then read the dragon book.<p>i just wanted to share my experience. i think the dragon book is a great book.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36146877\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36146877</a></p>\n<p>Points: 9</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36146877", "date_published": "2023-06-01 02:14:23+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "FAA seeks public input on drone operations", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-seeks-public-input-drone-operations\">https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-seeks-public-input-drone-operations</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36146627\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36146627</a></p>\n<p>Points: 7</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>", "link": "https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-seeks-public-input-drone-operations", "date_published": "2023-06-01 01:24:44+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "More malicious extensions in Chrome Web Store", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://palant.info/2023/05/31/more-malicious-extensions-in-chrome-web-store/\">https://palant.info/2023/05/31/more-malicious-extensions-in-chrome-web-store/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36146278\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36146278</a></p>\n<p>Points: 13</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>", "link": "https://palant.info/2023/05/31/more-malicious-extensions-in-chrome-web-store/", "date_published": "2023-06-01 00:26:45+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
