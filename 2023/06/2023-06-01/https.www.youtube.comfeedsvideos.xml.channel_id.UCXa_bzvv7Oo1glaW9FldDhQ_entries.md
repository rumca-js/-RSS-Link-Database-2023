Ashfall doesn’t have a concrete release date at the moment - but the developers are targeting to complete the game by Q4 2024. That is definitely a pretty risky move since Q4 is usually packed with blockbuster releases, and a new MMORPG is likely to get brushed under the barrage of other highly anticipated releases at the same time. But if Ashfall is able to generate enough hype with its marketing, it might just stand a chance against the heavy hitters of next year.

But looking at Ashfall in isolation, it’s a solid game that has plenty of great things going for it - right from the well realized world to the vast scope of the open world and the dynamic combat loop and much more. Hopefully, Legendary Star Studio is able to take these merits and craft a game that ends up surpassing the expectations of the player in every manner. Fingers crossed, until then.

This DLC feels like an earnest attempt at addressing criticisms the game got when it was first released. Its writing is much improved, the smaller scope helps make the DLC feels like a more focused experience, and the game’s combat is improved quite a bit with the addition of new spells and abilities. 

The only real downside is that you’d have to play through the story of Forspoken for the DLC to make much sense.
