  <p id="Kokm14">Those of you concerned about artificially intelligent robots taking over the world should really be keeping an eye on robot vacuums. I swear these things are breeding.

  <p id="BEUZPb">Microsoft is greatly improving its free version of Microsoft Teams on Windows 11 today. The built-in Teams app will now include support for Microsoft’s communities feature inside Teams, the company’s answer to Facebook and Discord. It’s also getting support for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/12/23400270/ai-generated-art-dall-e-microsoft-designer-app-office-365-suite">Microsoft Designer</a>, the AI art tool that lets you generate images for things like event invitations or social media posts using text prompts.</p>
<p id="756Yrz">Microsoft Teams communities <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/7/23497938/microsoft-teams-communities-feature">originally launched in December</a> for family and friends — or small community groups and businesses — to organize through meetings, calendars, and chat. It’s Microsoft’s answer to what you might find on Facebook or how people use Discord, WhatsApp, Reddit, and many other services for organizing groups.</p>

  <p id="DEWx3x">Starting June 4th, the 128GB version of the Quest 2 will cost $299.99 while the 256GB version will cost $349.99, <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/06/meta-quest-3-coming-this-fall/">Meta announced today</a>. That’s a $100 price cut for the entry-level version and a $80 price cut for the step-up model. As well as cutting the price of the headset, Meta also says it’s working on a software update that will improve both CPU and GPU performance on the Quest 2, as well as the more recent Quest Pro. </p>
<p id="GiCie0">News of the price cut comes roughly a year after Meta <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/26/23279272/meta-quest-2-occulus-100-price-increase">increased the price of both storage variants</a> of the headset by $100, almost two years after its original release in 2020.
