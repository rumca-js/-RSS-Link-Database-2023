Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and political commentator Matt Walsh discuss his landmark documentary, “What Is A Woman?,” its inception and purpose, how the trans movement has distorted culture and endangered children, the realities of being mobbed, and how Matt continues to push the envelope with his ongoing endeavors.

Matt Walsh is a popular writer, speaker, and one of the Right's most influential voices. He is the host of “The Matt Walsh Show,” and author of the best-selling children’s book Johnny the Walrus. His documentary “What is a Woman?” has become a cultural phenomenon and one of the most talked-about documentaries of 2022.
