<p>Getting access to everything you want to watch without a cable subscription is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-video-streaming-services-133000093.html">easy these days</a> — but the subscription fees <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-27-how-to-stream-more-and-spend-less.html">can add up quickly</a>. On average, streaming services charge between $5 and $15 each month for their on-demand libraries. If you're a Verizon Wireless customer, however, you might be able to save a little with a new bundle: starting on June 2nd, the company will offer Netflix's Premium Plan and Paramount+ with Showtime for $25.99 per month.&nbsp;</p><p>The deal is available exclusively through <a href="https://plusplay.verizon.com/discover">Verizon's +play portal</a>, which it introduced last year as a tool to help customers manage their streaming subscriptions and discover new content. It's essentially a service that helps you consolidate all of your streaming bills in one place, and this bundle seems to be an incentive to get more users on the service. To get access, however, you'll need to be a Verizon Wireless customer specifically: subscribers to Verizon Fios don't qualify.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Netflix's Premium plan costs $19.99 on its own, and you'll pay $11.99 for Paramount+ with Showtime —  Verizon's deal can save about $6 a month for a qualifying customer.&nbsp;</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/verizon-streaming-bundle-offers-netflix-premium-and-paramount-with-showtime-for-26-190627317.html?src=rss

## ‘Spider-Man 2’ will let you swap between Peter and Miles with the push of a button

<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/spider-man-2/"><em><ins>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</ins></em></a> gameplay that Sony <a href="https://www.engadget.com/first-look-at-spider-man-2-gameplay-shows-spidey-in-the-venom-suit-212740681.html"><ins>showed during last week’s PlayStation Showcase</ins></a> shed some light on what it will be like to play as both Peter Parker and Miles Morales in the same game. During a spectacular set piece, the action switched between the two characters. One of the burning questions fans were left with was how swapping between the Spider-Men would work throughout the single-player game, and now developer Insomniac has provided an answer.</p><p>&quot;When you're playing the main story, we control when you switch between Pete and Miles... it's done in service to the story when we're making those switches, for sure,&quot; <em>Spider-Man 2</em> creative director Bryan Intihar told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-how-character-switching-in-spider-man-2-works"><em><ins>Eurogamer</ins></em></a>. &quot;We have content designed around Peter, we have content designed around Miles and we have content where you can play either. You'll be able to, in the open world, freely switch between them with a simple button press.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It seems that the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-05-02-three-points-of-view-on-grand-theft-auto-5.html"><em>Grand Theft Auto V-</em>style character switching</a> will happen swiftly too, thanks to the PS5’s capabilities. One of the early examples of the console’s speedy loading times was seen in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/miles-morales-ps5-review-spider-man-161228925.html"><em>Spider-Man: Miles Morales</em></a>, where players could use the fast travel system to get from one end of Manhattan to the other in just a couple of seconds.</p><p>In addition, Miles and Peter will each have their own skill trees, and there will be a third one that they share so you can use some of the same abilities with either character. &quot;We saw in the gameplay reveal where Miles has the evolved Venom powers, whereas Peter has the Symbiote abilities. And so those, those change a bit of how you play, and you can upgrade those in their respective trees as well,” game director Ryan Smith said.</p><p>Meanwhile, by expanding to Queens and Brooklyn in the sequel, Insomniac says the sequel’s map is around double the size of the previous two games. “Since these two areas are somewhat smaller and residential, I think you’ll find them different from Manhattan,” Intihar said in a <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2023/06/marvels-spider-man-2-map-roughly-twice-the-size-of-previous-games-character-switching-detailed"><em><ins>Gematsu</ins></em></a> translation of a <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/news/202306/02304688.html"><em><ins>Famitsu</ins></em></a> interview. “We’ve prepared some unexpected situations we haven’t done before, like a battle on the river between two of the cities, so I hope you’ll look forward to them.”</p><p>Insomniac hasn’t revealed a release date for <em>Spider-Man 2</em>. However, it said the PlayStation 5 exclusive is still on track to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spider-man-2-ps5-release-date-2023-185123502.html">arrive this fall</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/spider-man-2-will-let-you-swap-between-peter-and-miles-with-the-push-of-a-button-182502190.html?src=rss

## Moto Razr 2023 hands-on: Two promising foldable updates to an iconic phone

<p>When Motorola rebooted the legendary Razr line as a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-14-motorola-razr-review-2020-foldable-fashion-statement.html">foldable phone in 2019</a>, it felt like such a natural evolution. Unfortunately, we haven’t gotten a ton of updates since then aside from a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/motorola-razr-5g-snapdragon-765g-better-camera-foldable-1400-dollars-190049338.html">mildly-upgraded 5G variant in 2020</a> and a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/motos-folding-razr-2022-finally-packs-a-flagship-processor-085914570.html">China-only version late last year</a>. But that changes now because today Motorola is announcing not one but two new members of the Razr family with the Razr and Razr+. And after getting a chance to check both of them out, I feel like each one has some interesting features you don’t get on competing devices.</p><p>In terms of general design, both the Razr and Razr+ share the same chassis and internal flexible display. The main difference is that the Razr+ sports a 3.6-inch 144Hz pOLED screen on its front – which Motorola claims is the largest exterior display on any foldable available today – while the standard Razr has a much smaller 1.5-inch external panel. The Razr+ also boasts faster performance thanks to a Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chip that helps the phone achieve a 165Hz refresh rate on its main screen, whereas the Razr uses a Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 chip that can only support 144Hz. Both also feature 30-watt wired charging and wireless Qi charging, though the latter is capped to a slow 5 watts.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="de671c519b5d49edb836dcb229a879ca"></div><p>Both feature a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, 8GB of RAM and up to 128GB of storage (or 256GB on the Razr+). They have the same 32-megapixel hole-punch selfie cameras on the interior, with the Razr+ packing a 12-MP main rear camera and a 13-MP ultra-wide/macro setup, while the regular Razr’s sensors are 64-MP and 8-MP respectively. And as a nod towards everyday durability, both Razrs do have some form of water resistance, though their IP52 ratings aren’t good for protecting against more than a weak splash or light rain.</p><p>With that out of the way, I’m going to focus on the Razr+ because it’s the more interesting of the two. Unlike the previous foldable Razrs from 2019 and 2020, the new model doesn’t sport the line’s iconic chin, which is a bit sad. But in exchange, you get a much bigger screen that feels more usable when compared to rivals like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-4-review-camera-samples-specs-price-battery-life-170027529.html">Samsung’s Z Flip 4</a>. And the way the display wraps around the phone’s two main cameras looks better too.</p><figure><img alt="The Razr+ will be available in three colors: Infinite Black, Glacier Blue and Viva Magenta." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/a380bbb0-0084-11ee-af5f-5cae933cc328" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>On top of that, Motorola optimized the exterior display so you can access your most important apps, notifications and more without things feeling too cramped. Heck, there are even some simple games that have been tweaked specifically for the outside display. That means you can do stuff like look at a map, respond to texts or check your calendar without having to open the phone. This gives you some of the adaptability of a big foldable like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review-specs-price-a-flagship-foldable-refined-131543810.html">Z Fold 4</a> but in a more compact device.</p><p>Then when you open up the Razr+, you’re greeted by a beautiful 6.9-inch flexible OLED display with great brightness (up to 1,100 nits). And while there technically is a crease that you can feel if you run your fingers over the middle of the screen, visually, it’s almost undetectable. It’s a really nice acheivement and when you combine that with a chassis that folds completely flat and measures just 15.1mm when closed, you start to really appreciate the many subtle design tweaks Moto made to get here. You even get Gorilla Glass Victus in the front and back for a bit of extra toughness (except for on the Viva Magenta model which gets a vegan leather material in the rear).</p><p>In a lot of ways, the Razr+’s body feels like a more polished and functional take on the Z Flip 4’s template. The outside screen is bigger and easier to use while the flexible display on the inside doesn’t suffer from any distracting furrows or wrinkles. Moto even included a slightly larger 3,800 mAh battery, which is great because longevity has never been a strong suit of flip-style foldable phones. And thanks to a new hinge that can hold its position when half open, Moto was even able to include a number of nifty camera modes so you can hold the phone like an old-school camcorder, use the exterior screen to give your subjects a preview of your shot or trigger the new Photobooth mode by holding your hand up.</p><p>As for the standard Razr, the benefit of having a smaller exterior screen is that it leaves room for a larger sensor on its main camera in addition to a slightly bigger 4,200 mAh battery. And while you don’t get Gorilla Glass Victus on its exterior, subbing that out for vegan leather seems like a great choice both for style and durability.</p><figure><img alt="The standard Razr will be available in three colors (cream, lilac and sage), but feature vegan leather on its front and back instead of Gorilla Glass Victus like on the Razr+." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/dc5f9a00-0084-11ee-b7ed-050d82996c38" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>But my favorite thing about the 2023 Razr family is that by expanding the line into two devices, it feels like Motorola is making foldable phones a lot more approachable. At $1,000, the Razr+ is almost bridging the gap between modern flip phones and bigger foldable devices and could be ideal for people who want a compact device that doesn’t sacrifice much in terms of usability.</p><p>My one concern at this point is Moto’s timing. Currently, the Razr+ is slated to be available for pre-order starting on June 16th before official sales begin on June 23rd. That’s close to when Samsung typically announces new foldables in the late summer, which means the Razr+ may only be on the market for a month or two before fresh opposition (likely with faster silicon) appears.</p><figure><img alt="Both the Razr and Razr+ are made with the same chassis and 6.9-inch interior flexible OLED display. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/1f9b0ed0-0085-11ee-9dec-96007f72ce85" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Meanwhile, for those curious about foldable handsets, there’s the standard Razr. Sure, it’s got a slower chip and its exterior screen isn’t meant for much more than checking notifications. The one hang-up is that at least for now, there’s no official info about an expected price or release date. But according to Motorola executives, it will also be “meaningfully cheaper” than the Razr+, which could make it a great entry-level foldable – especially if Moto can get the price down around $750 or less.</p><p>But if you’re like me and you’ve been waiting for more foldable phones to hit shelves, between Moto’s two new Razrs and Google’s upcoming Pixel Fold, this summer has gotten a lot more exciting real quick.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/moto-razr-2023-hands-on-two-promising-foldable-updates-to-an-iconic-phone-specs-price-180043133.html?src=rss

## Motorola's folding Razr+ will have a giant external display

<p>Motorola skipped the US market with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/motos-folding-razr-2022-finally-packs-a-flagship-processor-085914570.html">last year's Razr</a>, but it's coming back — and there may be reasons to consider the company's latest foldable phones over Samsung's rival <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-4-review-camera-samples-specs-price-battery-life-170027529.html">Galaxy Z Flip</a> series.The company has introduced a 2023 Razr family headlined by the Razr+ (Razr 40 Ultra in Europe), a flagship-level model whose centerpiece is a comparatively huge 3.6-inch, 1,056 x 1,066 external display running at up to 144Hz. The extra real estate allows for quick access &quot;panels&quot; (including a dedicated Spotify panel) and even mini games.</p><p>The folding action is also improved. Like the Z Flip, you can now open the device at different angles for hands-free recording and video viewing. A redesigned hinge also makes this the thinnest foldable phone on the market when closed, Motorola claims. The internal 6.9-inch, 165Hz 1080p screen (slightly larger than the 6.7 inches of before) is &quot;nearly creaseless&quot; at the same time, and you'll find spatial audio that includes Dolby Atmos support.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Razr+ isn't any faster than the 2022 model with a Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chip and 8GB of RAM. Motorola is rethinking its camera approach, mind you. The new phone includes 'just' a 12MP main camera, but dual-pixel autofocus and a wide f/1.5 aperture could make it well-suited to low-light shots. You'll also find a 13MP ultra-wide cam that doubles as a macro shooter, and a 32MP selfie camera sits in a cutout in the main display. The clamshell should last longer, too, thanks to a larger 3,800mAh battery that reportedly lasts all day and night with wireless or 30W wired charging.</p><p>The price may be as much of a draw as the phone itself. Motorola will sell the Razr+ with 256GB of storage on June 23rd through its website, AT&amp;T, Google Fi, T-Mobile, Optimum Mobile and Spectrum Mobile for $1,000, or $41.67 per month in a two-year instalment plan. In Europe, it's available now for €1,200. That's well below the price of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/motorola-razr-5g-snapdragon-765g-better-camera-foldable-1400-dollars-190049338.html">past US models</a>, and makes it competitive with the Galaxy Z Flip 4 you can buy as of this writing. It's just a question of whether or not you like Motorola's hardware enough to avoid waiting for the likely Galaxy Z Flip 5 launch this summer.</p><figure><img alt="Motorola Razr (2023)" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/4d3ab6b0-fff4-11ed-b296-238d2f2bcce3" style="height: 1280px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Motorola</div></figure><p>There will also be a rare option for the budget-conscious, or those who simply want to reduce the temptation to check their phones. The plain Motorola Razr (Razr 40 elsewhere) has a 6.9-inch, 144Hz 1080p main display with the same hinge tech as the higher-end model, but carries a much smaller 1.5-inch external screen that provides just the essentials — in a sense, it harkens back to older Z Flip models.</p><p>You'll have to settle for a Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 and 128GB of storage. However, you will get a larger 4,200mAh battery and a higher-resolution 64MP main camera. This may be the better option if you're more interested in longevity than raw speed.</p><p>The base Razr will reach North America sometime in the &quot;coming months.&quot; Motorola hasn't divulged pricing, but executives say the device will be &quot;meaningfully cheaper&quot; than the Razr+. If so, that could make it one of the first modestly-priced foldables in the US. You won't have to pay top-tier money to get a more pocketable handset, even if you're sacrificing some performance in the process.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/motorolas-folding-razr-will-have-a-giant-external-display-180012979.html?src=rss

## VR Assassin’s Creed, Stranger Things and Ghostbusters arrive on Meta Quest later this year

<p>Meta announced a slate of upcoming games today for its standalone VR headsets (including the upcoming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-meta-quest-3-is-a-499-mixed-reality-headset-with-full-color-passthrough-141204527.html">Meta Quest 3</a>). Apple is expected to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-wwdc-2023-what-to-expect-from-ios-17-to-new-macbooks-160033810.html">enter the virtual headset space</a> next week, so Meta is hoping to make a lasting impression with its lineup of upcoming VR titles from beloved franchises, including Assassin’s Creed, Stranger Things, Ghostbusters and Attack on Titan — along with some VR remakes of old-school classics.</p><p>In addition to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asgards-wrath-2-is-metas-most-ambitious-vr-game-to-date-172826048.html"><em>Asgard's Wrath 2</em></a>, the most enticing game may be the one we know the least about. Although it was little more than a tease, Meta confirmed that <em>Assassin’s Creed Nexus VR</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/assassins-creed-splinter-cell-oculus-vr-173053513.html">isn’t vaporware</a> after all: The next VR installment in the long-running series will launch in the Meta Quest Store later this year. Unfortunately, further details must wait for its official reveal at Ubisoft Forward on June 12th.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="6668baf2696440739cb6fc81eaf1625a"></div><p>We first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/stranger-things-vr-game-coming-from-netflix-091242862.html">learned about</a> an upcoming <em>Stranger Things VR</em> game late last year, and today we got a closer look. The title lets you play as season four villain Vecna as you “invade the dreams and memories of fan-favorite characters and harness telekinetic powers to possess minds and battle creatures.” Gameplay includes grabbing, crushing and throwing opponents using telekinesis and opening and closing portals “at your peril.” Meanwhile, the story will allow you to tap into Vecna’s more human past to “relive memories from [Henry Creel’s] time at Hawkins Lab with Dr. Brenner as you explore an otherworldly, interconnected hive mind.” <em>Stranger Things VR</em> is developed by Tender Claws and will launch this fall on “major VR platforms,” including Meta Quest Pro / 3 / 2.</p><p><em>Ghostbusters: Rise of the Ghost Lord</em> is another <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ghostbusters-rise-ghost-lord-vr-meta-quest-2-psvr2-trailer-014513278.html">previously announced</a> VR game in the pipeline from an iconic IP. The trailer focuses on the backstory of Gustav Hookfaber, a disgruntled and morally confused scientist who has transformed into the villainous Ghost Lord to wreak havoc on San Francisco. You’ll wield proton packs and other classic equipment for solo or co-op ghost-busting. “Continue the Ghostbusters’ legacy, protect the city from fiendish ghosts, and experience all the humor and frights from the beloved franchise,” the game’s description reads. <em>Ghostbusters: Rise of the Ghost Lord</em> will launch on Meta headsets this fall.</p><div id="c01d736003244f48b6fccc72b52f283f"></div><p>Although it may not be as familiar to younger audiences, <em>The 7th Guest</em> was one of the coolest spectacles to fire up on your cutting-edge CD-ROM in the mid-90s. About three decades later, you’ll be able to play an updated version of the atmospheric adventure / puzzle game in virtual reality. “[Developer Vertigo Games] is using volumetric video capture to recreate the FMV (full-motion video) storytelling of the original game, bringing the classic adventure to life like never before,” the description reads. “And for the first time ever, the iconic mansion is being recreated in full 3D — though don’t be surprised if it starts shifting around you. After all, it’s haunted.” <em>The 7th Guest</em> arrives later this year for Quest.</p><p>Another remake, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-12-01-bulletstorm-remaster-ps4-xbox-pc-gearbox-people-can-fly.html">ultraviolent 2011 first-person shooter</a><em>Bulletstorm</em> is also getting a VR makeover. And the game’s creatively gruesome “Skillshots” are in tow. “Kick an enemy into a cactus?” the game’s teaser asks rhetorically. “Skillshot. Crush one under a hot dog cart? Skillshot.

## 'Asgard's Wrath 2' is Meta's most ambitious VR game to date

<p>One of the biggest announcements at today's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/metas-next-quest-games-showcase-is-june-1st-165019399.html"><ins>Meta Quest Gaming Showcase</ins></a> was <em>Asgard’s Wrath 2,</em> a sequel to the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/asgards-wrath"><ins>well-regarded original</ins></a> from 2019 that’s slated for release this winter. It's shaping up to be Meta's most ambitious game to date — it's an action RPG that the company thinks can stand alongside the genre’s heaviest hitters on consoles and PC. To live up to that promise, developer Sanzaru Games may have to push a VR headset that uses mobile technology from 2020 to its limits.</p><p>In a gameplay overview video, Sanzaru studio creative director Mat Kraemer said that <em>Asgard's Wrath 2</em> features &quot;massive worlds beyond the scope of any other game on the Meta Quest platform.&quot; Much of the action will take place in Ancient Egypt rather than the Norse setting of the first game, though you’ll still visit Muspelheim (a location that God of War fans will be familiar with).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="d35ff9f9a948470c99f3bbce75a76d70"></div><p>Like <em>Asgard's Wrath,</em> the sequel features animals you can turn into companions to help with  puzzles and combat. For the first time in the series, you can also use the animals as mounts to help you traverse the larger landscapes. Elsewhere, there’s a more aggressive approach to combat this time around, compared with the original game's defense-based system. Previously, players had to parry and block before having the opportunity to remove enemy shields. In <em>Asgard's Wrath 2</em>, they can use rapid attacks to chip away at shields or use skilled parries for more powerful attacks. In a neat touch, enemies will be able to catch thrown weapons and hurl them back at you.</p><p>Many of the elements you'd expect from a modern action RPG are present here, from crafting, minigames (including fishing and a slingshot shooting gallery) and extensive exploration to gear and weapon upgrades and enemies that grow stronger as you do. Both you and your animal buddies have skill trees to level up. As in the first game, you'll be able to manipulate the world with cosmic powers. Elemental weaponry should provide more enemy variety and customization, while you can possess mortals to use their skills and abilities and help them fulfill their destinies.</p><figure><img alt="A screenshot of Asgard's Wrath 2 from a first-person perspective. The player character is shown holding a shield in one hand and lashing a whip with the other. In front of the player is a large, crab-like monster. To the left is a pillar with art depicting an ancient Egyptian figure." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/8e6e3b60-0095-11ee-9dba-fa117ac5aa98" style="height: 1080px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sanzaru Games/Oculus Studios</div></figure><p>That's a lot for any game to juggle, let alone one that's running on a similar chipset to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-28-samsung-galaxy-s20-ultra-review-space-zoom-camera.html"><ins>Samsung Galaxy S20 series</ins></a>. Sanzaru, which made the original game for Oculus Rift, is developing <em>Asgard’s Wrath 2 </em>for Meta Quest 2. The headset uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2, which is derived from the Snapdragon 865.</p><p>While many players will be diving into the game on a Quest 2, the Meta Quest 3, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-meta-quest-3-is-a-499-mixed-reality-headset-with-full-color-passthrough-141204527.html"><ins>which was revealed today,</ins></a> will be available by the time <em>Asgard’s Wrath 2 </em>comes out. “Meta Quest 3’s advanced processor and higher resolution will provide an even better look and feel within <em>Asgard’s Wrath 2</em>, while players will have a more comfortable wear during the game’s 60+ hours of gameplay,” a Meta spokesperson told Engadget.</p><p>In any case, it seems that Sanzaru is squeezing as much as it can out of the current headset, which gave the studio more to work with than the Rift.</p><p>&quot;The biggest and best thing is that now we're working with devices that are completely wireless, untethered, kind of the way this a game like this is meant to be played, because it's so combat centric,&quot; Sanzaru creative director Grace Lingad told Engadget. &quot;We really focus on visceral, gesture-based, physics-based combat. Being free of external tracking sensors and wires and everything like that, the Quest platform has really been a game changer for the franchise.&quot;</p><p>As for how the game might run on the Quest Pro, Lingad (who spoke to Engadget before the Quest 3 was announced) said that Sanzaru’s focus was on the Quest 2 due to that headset having a big install base. “We really want to make sure as many people as possible can enjoy this game,” she said.</p><figure><img alt="A screenshot of Asgard's Wrath 2 from a first-person perspective. One of the player character's hands is holding a leash for a panther, on which they are riding. The other had is pointing a sword toward an ancient Egyptian temple." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/d016db30-0095-11ee-bce8-fa76d959aa1b" style="height: 1080px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sanzaru Games/Oculus Studios</div></figure><p>In recent weeks, critics have called out other major action RPGs, namely <a href="https://www.engadget.com/redfall-review-good-enough-for-game-pass-000641521.html"><em><ins>Redfall</ins></em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/diablo-iv-review-a-mechanically-perfect-romp-through-a-shallow-world-160017353.html"><em><ins>Diablo IV</ins></em></a>, over the state of their open worlds outside of the main quests. Striking the right balance between having plenty to do in <em>Asgard's Wrath 2</em> and giving players open areas to tear across on their mounts while dealing with the limitations of the Quest 2 hardware was something Sanzaru had to bear in mind.</p><p>&quot;That's one of the big design challenges that the team had to deal with, because there's ways that we can build the levels so that they feel like they're sprawling, but of course, we have to consider the hardware limitations,&quot; Lingard said. &quot;There's some amount of negative space, which is good for the eyes, for the mind to rest.</p><p>&quot;We do try to tuck in little side areas, but they're hidden and tucked away,&quot; she added. &quot;It's really for the players, the ones who really like to explore that whole, 'hey, there's this little area, if I can crawl through there...' and then you emerge into this secret monster den and we hide some really challenging stuff in there, really good rewards in there. So, in that way, we keep the density high, but it's not like all <em>bam, bam, bam,</em> in your face, which I think is a clever move by our team.&quot;</p><div id="dd0377ec7c804ac6bd66d9120ee9e204"></div><p>Sanzaru, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-26-facebook-buys-asgards-wrath-sanzaru-games.html"><ins>which Meta snapped up in 2020</ins></a>, estimates <em>Asgard's Wrath 2</em>'s campaign will take 60-plus hours to beat. That’s around twice the length of the original game. On top of that, there's an endless mode called Uncharted Rifts that has randomly generated dungeons. Players can dip into that mode at almost any point to plunder high-level loot to take back into the campaign, but Uncharted Rifts could keep ardent fans going well after they've finished the story.</p><p>Add everything up, and that's a long time to spend playing a game in a virtual reality headset, particularly one with fast-paced combat. Motion sickness has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-08-30-how-to-make-players-sick-in-your-virtual-reality-game.html"><ins>a long-standing concern for VR users</ins></a>. Sanzaru has kept that in consideration while building out <em>Asgard Wrath 2</em>'s settings and accessibility features.</p><p>Lingard said it was important for the team to offer a swathe of settings that players &quot;can use to tailor their experience to their comfort level.&quot; Those concern factors such as motion sickness and combat difficulty. The accessibility options include movement settings, such as snap turning and smooth turning with the controller, rather than having to rotate your body. It's particularly important for a VR game to give players a wide array of options, Lingard notes, because the experience is &quot;so visceral and personal.&quot;</p><p>Since everyone's history with VR is different, &quot;we really make it a point to have a lot of settings available.&quot; she said. &quot;We really want to respect people's time. For some people, maybe this is their first game in VR. We're hoping we really launch with a splash and people want to check it out for themselves. We want to make sure that experience is as accessible and as easy to get into as possible.&quot;</p><p>On that note, Sanzaru wanted to make sure <em>Asgard's Wrath 2</em> is welcoming to VR newcomers and folks who haven't played the first game. You can opt to see a recap of the previous title before you get started</p><p>We’ll need to wait several more months to find out whether the Quest 2 and Quest 3 (which is said to offer double the graphics performance of the current model) can truly support Sanzaru’s ambitions. But if you're a fan of the first game or you're looking for a lengthy, immersive VR experience, it may be worth adding <em>Asgard’s Wrath 2</em> to your wishlist.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/asgards-wrath-2-is-metas-most-ambitious-vr-game-to-date-172826048.html?src=rss

## Lordstown's EV pickup has a worryingly short 174 miles of EPA range

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/lordstown-motors-freezes-production-to-address-quality-issues-210811052.html">Lordstown Motors' problems</a> now include the performance of its first EV. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) <a href="https://fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&amp;id=46519&amp;id=46329&amp;id=46312">has rated</a> the Endurance pickup's range at just 174 miles. For context, the all-wheel drive <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-f-150-lightning-ev-preview-video-170103332.html">Ford F-150 Lightning</a> manages 240 miles with a smaller battery, and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-r1t-electric-truck-review-150019762.html">Rivian R1T</a> manages 289 miles. This is also well short of Lordstown's original claim that the truck would manage an EPA-rated 250 miles of driving.</p><p>We've asked Lordstown for comment. <em>Autoblog</em><a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2023/06/01/lordstown-endurance-pickup-gets-epa-rated-174-miles-of-range/?ncid=edlinkusauto00000015">notes</a> EPA figures are sometimes too conservative. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-15-porsche-taycan-first-drive.html">Porsche Taycan</a>, for instance, regularly exceeds its government-rated range in real-world driving. The Endurance also tows more than the F-150, although it has less than half the payload capacity. The Ford is also priced $399 lower.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If the rating holds up, it largely limits the appeal of the Endurance to customers who only need short-distance hauls, such as contractors who make infrequent stops in a single city. It could be problematic for workers who make many stops, not to mention anyone who has to travel between cities.</p><p>Accurate or not, the EPA rating compounds Lordstown's troubles. The Ohio brand is still <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lordstown-motors-may-stop-endurance-ev-production-in-the-near-future-180630375.html">grappling with production issues</a> that have hindered its output. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-selling-its-stake-in-troubled-electric-pickup-maker-lordstown-motors-091509553.html">GM sold its stake</a> in the company last year, and manufacturing partner Foxconn is threatening to pull out over an alleged stock-related breach of contract. Now, it's not clear that the Endurance will be competitive even if Lordstown can solve its other dilemmas.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/lordstowns-ev-pickup-has-a-worryingly-short-174-miles-of-epa-range-164714534.html?src=rss

<p>Don't worry if your favorite shop or gym doesn't have a digital membership card, as you'll soon have a way to create one yourself. Google Wallet will soon add the option to save passes to wallet by taking a photo of the card. So long as there's a barcode or QR code, you can replicate it on your Android phone for convenience and a backup.</p><p>Google is also matching Apple in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/maryland-drivers-license-id-apple-wallet-162457417.html">supporting digital IDs</a>. As of today, Maryland residents can add their driver's licenses and ID cards to Wallet on any device using Android 8 or newer. Arizona, Colorado and Georgia residents will have the option in the months ahead. You can already use the Maryland IDs for TSA PreCheck lines at some airports, but an upgrade later this year will let you use digital IDs to verify online accounts or book cars through Turo.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Health insurance cards are also coming to Wallet through Humana in the US and the UK government's HMRC app. As these cards include sensitive info, you'll have to verify through a phone sign-in (such as your fingerprint) whenever you want to use them. Later this year, you can add corporate badges to Wallet.</p><p>You'll also have a way to get your passes through Google's Messages app when RCS is enabled. You can check in to a flight or train ride using a chatbot and get a Wallet pass without leaving the app. This will initially be available for travelers through Spanish train operator Renfe as well as Vietnam Airlines, while gourmands can reserve restaurants through platforms like TagMe.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-wallet-will-let-you-add-passes-by-taking-a-photo-160028725.html?src=rss

## Ford will offer flexible Mustang Mach-E leases to Uber drivers in three cities

<p>Uber drivers won't just have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-rents-tesla-evs-to-drivers-131556170.html">easy access to Tesla cars</a> when they want to switch to EVs. Ford and Uber are launching an expanded Drive pilot program that provides a flexible <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fords-upgraded-mustang-mach-e-offers-more-range-at-a-lower-price-161151398.html">Mustang Mach-E</a> lease to rideshare drivers in Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco. Operators pick leases in one- to four-month increments, and get their Mach-E within two weeks. After that, they use a Ford Drive app to handle payments and maintenance. Ford, meanwhile, buys fleets of the electric crossovers from dealerships and uses them for service.</p><p>A lease costs $199 per week with 500 included miles, and $249 per week with 1,000 miles. Drivers pay 20 cents for every additional mile beyond what their plan offers. That may seem expensive, but Ford is counting on the no-hassle exits and renewals as a draw. Uber workers can lease only when they have enough driving time to justify the expense.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Ford and Uber initially tested Drive in San Diego last year with over 150 Mustang Mach-E cars in the fleet. The companies didn't say how successful the initial run was, but they note that California is Uber's best market for EV demand. Nearly 10 percent of all passenger miles were completed in EVs as of late 2022, Ford says.</p><p>To qualify, drivers need to have at least a 4.85-star rating and over 150 trips. The Mustang on offer is a no-frills rear-wheel drive model with 247 miles of range, although it does have CoPilot360 driver aids.</p><p>The lease option is in line with Uber's goal of becoming a zero-emissions service in North America and Europe by 2030. This theoretically makes EVs more viable for drivers who can't commit to a purchase or multi-year lease. Uber also sweetens the proposition with an extra $1 per ride (up to $4,000 per year) and the option of serving premium Comfort Electric passengers. Not that Uber has much choice. California will require that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-rule-ride-hailing-ev-2030-072036470.html">most ride hailing cars are electric</a> by 2030, while New York City wants a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/new-york-city-uber-lyft-electric-cars-2030-222628210.html">wholesale switch</a> by the same year.</p><p>Ford, meanwhile, benefits by getting the Mach-E into the hands of rideshare drivers who would otherwise rent a Tesla EV through Hertz. This boosts exposure for the brand for passengers, too, and helps with Ford's bid to establish itself as a general mobility company. The challenge is simply competing against Tesla's sheer volume. The Hertz deal puts up to 50,000 Tesla EVs on American roads, and Ford's Drive pilot won't compete at its current scale.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ford-will-offer-flexible-mustang-mach-e-leases-to-uber-drivers-in-three-cities-151534606.html?src=rss

<p>Arturia's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-fx-collection-3-distortion-lo-fi-granular-effects-173429817.html">effects collection</a> just became a better value, particularly if you're looking to recreate classic sounds. The company has <a href="https://www.arturia.com/products/software-effects/fx-collection/overview">released</a> an FX Collection 4 pack that adds four effects, including a brand new Rotary CLS-222 kit (above) that modernizes the Leslie rotary speaker emulator. It's best known as the sound used by guitarists like George Harrison and David Gilmour, and has also been used by jazz organists.</p><p>FX Collection 4 otherwise adds effects you previously had to buy separately, including the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-dist-coldfire-distortion-plugin-204028687.html">Dist Coldfire</a> distortion plugin, the Korg-derived Filter MS-20 and the upgraded <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturias-augmented-brass-plugin-is-built-for-synthwave-and-sci-fi-scores-150043349.html">Rev LX-24</a> '80s reverb box. There are tweaks to several tools, including 40 new presets for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-efx-fragments-granular-vst-effect-193053457.html">Efx Fragments</a> and new functionality for the Bus Force and Rev Spring-636 effects. You might also be happy to see support for NKS VS3 and Apple Silicon AAX.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There's now a total of 30 effects, including the SansAmp pedal-inspired OpAmp-21, Dist Tube-Culture (a riff on the legendary Thermionic Culture Vulture distortion unit) and the tape emulation tool Tape Mello-Fi. While this won't cover every possible need, there's a good chance you can either reproduce a familiar sound or make an ordinary instrument almost unrecognizable.</p><p>The company is offering FX Collection 4 for $399. That's not particularly expensive as far as plugin bundles go. You might not need to buy much else to complete a track. We'd add that Arturia runs frequent sales, so it's worth watching out for potential discounts.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/arturias-fx-collection-4-adds-a-leslie-rotary-speaker-emulator-150009128.html?src=rss

<p>It didn't take long for me to fall in love with <em>Street Fighter 6</em>. Maybe it was during a particularly epic Drive Gauge parry, which filled my computer screen with explosive color, or while playing through the <em>Yakuza</em>-esque World Tour, as I picked fights with randos on the street. At some point, I felt like I was home again, combo-ing into Dragon Punches and wreaking havoc with Chun Li's endless arrays of lethal kicks. <em>Street Fighter 6</em> proves that <em>Street Fighter</em> is back – it's a game primed to welcome new fans and bring old ones back into the fold.</p><p>When I talk about old fans, I'm referring to myself. I remember the sense of awe I felt when I first encountered a <em>Street Fighter 2 </em>cabinet at my local Burger King (my hometown was sadly devoid of arcades). The sprites were bigger than I'd ever seen and gorgeously animated. The characters were all distinct and filled with personality. And the controls opened my eyes to the possibilities beyond mere platformers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There's a reason <em>Street Fighter's </em>special moves have lived on: They're easy to learn, but they require practice to pull off consistently. Get good enough, though, and they start to feel like an extension of yourself. If you're a hadouken master, you may as well have lightning crackling around your fingers.</p><p></p><figure><img alt="Ryu charging a hadouken in Street Fighter 6" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/23ad4da2-0083-11ee-afbc-a31ddeaec0d8" style="height: 1080px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Capcom</div></figure><p>In an effort to open up to new audiences, <em>Street Fighter 6</em> takes a remarkable new approach to special moves. In addition to the classic controls fans love, there's also a &quot;Modern&quot; scheme, which dramatically simplifies button inputs, as well as &quot;Dynamic&quot; controls, which basically let you mash buttons to have the game's AI take the wheel. The modern mode replaces the six separate punch and kick buttons with three buttons for light, medium and heavy attacks. There's also a standalone special move button that activates different attacks depending on how you're holding the directional pad. This change gives you four functional buttons right on the face of your gamepad, rather than shoving some attack buttons to shoulder buttons like the classic controls.</p><p>While <em>Street Fighter's</em> hardcore fans may decry these options as a way to water down the series, I see them as essential to its survival. The previous entry, <em>Street Fighter V,</em> was widely criticized for catering to e-sports players and other diehards. It took years for a traditional arcade mode to appear, but by then many had already written the game off. <em>Street Fighter 6, </em>on the other hand, is a direct appeal to casual fans and the <em>Street Fighter</em>-curious.</p><p>That's also evident in the new World Tour mode, which involves designing your own fighter to go on a series of quests throughout an NYC-like environment. It's basically a <em>Street Fighter</em> RPG crossed with a Yakuza game: You'll earn experience points and level up, and you can also challenge people on the street to impromptu matches. The results are almost always ridiculous — I never got tired of seeing bored businessmen throw down — but crucially, it's also genuinely fun.</p><p>Early on, World Tour also serves as a sort of interactive training mode for new players. It helps you understand the modern fighting mode, as well as some of the finer details of street fighting. You're also coached along the way by Luke, the last character introduced in <em>Street Fighter V</em>, and the ostensible main character for this game. As a big brother figure, he's cocky yet supportive, a helpful combination for new players.</p><div id="acc6ca38c10b461f9997e359d2d9f509"></div><p>Even before you get into a match, <em>Street Fighter 6 </em>oozes style. The opening menus are a combination of neon city lights and street art, the character select theme is a catchy (if cringey) hip hop tune, and the music in every stage got my subwoofer thumping. <em>Street Fighter 6</em> feels like a party that everyone's invited to, the vibes are just spot on.</p><p>Maybe that's why I had a hard time peeling myself away to deal with the real world, or to play other titles like <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>. The arcade mode is breezy enough to complete in under 10 minutes. By default it includes four fighting matches and one classic vehicle destruction mini-game, and the actual gameplay feels more addictive than ever. As usual, playing through an arcade session unlocks background details for characters, but this time you also earn classic <em>Street Fighter </em>art, most of which hit me right in my peak ‘90s nostalgia heart.</p><section><img alt="Guile punching Ryu in Street Fighter 6" class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/23ad4da0-0083-11ee-b176-4edcca8aceae" style="height: 720px; width: 1280px;" /></section><p>On top of the usual super-responsive <em>Street Fighter </em>mechanics, there's also a Drive Gauge that unlocks a wealth of new options. You can use it to launch into attacks that throw your opponents against the wall (leaving them vulnerable to some satisfying follow-up combos), parry attacks, throw out a reversal after blocking and rush across the screen. The drive gauge, which regenerates over time and with your own attacks, can also be used to give your special moves more bite. All of the drive mechanics are relatively easy to pull off, they typically just involve hitting two buttons, but learning how to deploy them will take some time.</p><p>Super Arts, the super-powered attacks that require more complex button inputs, also make a return. (Otherwise, <em>Street Fighter </em>players would probably just revolt again.) They rely on a separate super gauge, and in addition to dealing tons of damage, they can be used to blow away your competitor's drive gauge.</p><p>I swapped between an Xbox Elite 2 controller and a Hori arcade stick while playing <em>Street Fighter 6</em> on my PC, and both inputs felt incredibly smooth. As someone raised on SNES fighting games, I tend to favor gamepads, but I also found myself enjoying the arcade stick experience more than usual. The combination of <em>Street Fighter 6's</em> visuals, thumping soundtrack and overall style made me feel like I was in an actual arcade, and having a fight stick on my desk just enhanced that sensation.</p><p>In addition to Luke, <em>Street Fighter 6</em> adds new characters like the Judo expert/supermodel Manon (what a concept!), and the dapper older fighter JP. It usually takes me a while to warm up to new characters, especially when I haven't had much time with the classic <em>Street Fighter</em> roster recently, but all of the new additions bring something to the franchise. A few are also nods to earlier characters: Kimberly is a student of the former <em>Final Fight</em> ninja Guy; Lily is a member of T. Hawke's Thunderfoot tribe; and Jamie takes inspiration from Yun and Yang.</p><p>As for online play, I was only able to try <em>Street Fighter 6's</em> multiplayer for a few short sessions, but all of my matches felt smooth and lag-free. Of course, the experience will likely be different once hordes of desperate players show up. A new dedicated Battle Hub also serves as an online space for interacting with other players using your World Tour avatar. You can queue up for matches at arcade cabinets, play older games like <em>Final Fight </em>and <em>Street Fighter 2</em>, and even jump into matches with other player's avatars. I enjoyed the social element of Battle Hub, and it made multiplayer matches far more appealing than just queuing up against faceless players.</p><p><em>Street Fighter 6</em>'s many modes and fighting options may feel overwhelming to new players, but it's ultimately a celebration of everything that makes <em>Street Fighter </em>great. Franchises like <em>Mortal Kombat</em> have their extreme gore and (surprisingly) robust storytelling to rely on. The joy of Capcom's series has always been around hanging out with your friends, perfecting your combos and special moves, and learning the intricacies of your favorite characters. <em>Street Fighter 6</em> is a reminder that <em>Street Fighter </em>is for everyone, and that's a beautiful thing to behold.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/street-fighter-6-gets-the-vibe-right-141559193.html?src=rss

<p>Mark Zuckerberg has revealed the Meta Quest 3, the company's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-project-cambria-details-vr-headset-roadmap-181023351.html">long-rumored</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-quest-3-2023-233025187.html">next-gen</a> virtual reality headset. The Meta CEO showed off the device for the first time a few hours before the latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/metas-next-quest-games-showcase-is-june-1st-165019399.html">Meta Quest Games Showcase</a> and just ahead of Apple's WWDC.</p><p>As with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-quest-pro-review-a-next-gen-headset-for-the-vr-faithful-specs-price-130045313.html">Quest Pro</a>, the Quest 3 supports mixed reality and offers full-color passthrough. This enables users to see a color version of the physical space around them via the external cameras. The headset will be able to blend augmented reality elements into the outside world. Zuckerberg says it's &quot;the first mainstream headset with high-res color mixed reality.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Zuckerberg claims the device has a &quot;next-gen&quot; Qualcomm chipset and that it offers twice the graphics performance of the Quest 2. It's said to be Meta's &quot;most powerful headset yet. Despite the extra oomph, the Quest 3 is 40 percent thinner and more comfortable than its predecessor, Meta's CEO noted.</p><div id="ed7236106a1e4563b22fa8d01b1d4dbe"><blockquote class="instagram-media" style="border: 0; margin: 1px; padding: 0; width: 99.375%;"><div style="padding: 16px;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cs809N-BUJ7/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" style="padding: 0 0; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 100%;" target="_blank"><div style="display: flex;"><div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;"></div><div style="display: flex;"><div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;"></div><div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 14px; width: 60px;"></div></div></div><div style="padding: 19% 0;"></div><div style="display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;"></div><div style="padding-top: 8px;"><div style="color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal;">View this post on Instagram</div></div><div style="padding: 12.5% 0;"></div><div style="display: flex; margin-bottom: 14px;"><div><div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px;"></div><div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;"></div><div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px;"></div></div><div style="margin-left: 8px;"><div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 20px; width: 20px;"></div><div style="width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent;"></div></div><div style="margin-left: auto;"><div style="width: 0px; border-right: 8px solid transparent;"></div><div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 12px; width: 16px;"></div><div style="width: 0; height: 0; border-left: 8px solid transparent;"></div></div></div><div style="display: flex; margin-bottom: 24px;"><div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;"></div><div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 14px; width: 144px;"></div></div></a><p style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; white-space: nowrap;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cs809N-BUJ7/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">A post shared by Mark Zuckerberg (@zuck)</a></p></div></blockquote></div><p>Meta has redesigned the controllers for Quest 3. It says they're more streamlined and ergonomic, and they incorporate the TruTouch haptic feedback tech seen in the Touch Pro controllers. The new Touch Plus controllers also no longer have outer tracking rings. That, Meta says, will help them feel like a more natural extension of your hands and take up less space. In addition, the Quest 3 will support <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-27-oculus-quest-hand-tracking-hands-on.html"><ins>hand tracking</ins></a> from the jump.</p><p>The headset will start at $499 for 128GB of storage and it'll be available this fall in all countries where the Quest 2 is available. It's half the price of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-drops-the-price-of-its-quest-pro-vr-headset-to-999-153753541.html">Quest Pro</a> and it costs the same as a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/playstation-vr2-review-great-headset-should-be-cheaper-130032254.html">PlayStation VR2</a> (which users need to plug into a PS5).&nbsp;</p><p>The Quest 2, meanwhile, will once again cost $299 for the base 128GB version starting on June 4th. Meta<a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-quest-2-price-increase-180745817.html"> increased the price of that headset by $100</a> last year, blaming increased manufacturing costs. In March, it cut the price of the 256GB Quest 2 by $70 to $429 to help &quot;more people get into VR,&quot; Zuckerberg said at the time.</p><p>The Quest 3 will be fully compatible with every Quest 2 app and experience. The company will reveal more details about at its Connect conference, which will take place on September 27th,&nbsp;</p><p>It's hardly a surprise that Meta has a Quest 3 on the way. Earlier this week, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said he'd had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/metas-quest-3-headset-could-feature-color-cameras-for-more-lifelike-pass-through-video-155645837.html">hands-on time with a Quest 3 prototype</a>. Gurman wrote that the headset “feels far lighter and thinner” than the previous model and that it had a sturdier head strap. Unlike the Quest Pro, though, the Quest 3 may not have face or eye-tracking features.</p><p>Even if it weren't for all the reports that an updated headset would arrive this year, Meta is continuing to invest in VR games and experiences — it has sunk <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-q3-2022-earnings-211903277.html">tens of billions of dollars</a> into building its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-metaverse-meta-explained-or-not-120032885.html">vision of the metaverse</a> over the last couple of years. It's hard to imagine the company doing that without having a successor to the three-year-old Quest 2 in the works.</p><p>In another year, Zuckerberg might have waited until Connect to reveal the Quest 3. However, Meta may be trying to steal some of Apple's thunder. The latter is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-mixed-reality-headset-wwdc-2023-announcement-221042779.html">widely expected</a> to reveal a premium mixed-reality headset at WWDC next week. As such, Meta may soon have a major competitor in the mixed reality space.</p><p><em>This story is developing, please refresh for additional updates.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-meta-quest-3-is-a-499-mixed-reality-headset-with-full-color-passthrough-141204527.html?src=rss

## AMC transfers its on-demand streaming users to Vudu

<p>AMC Entertainment’s streaming service is migrating its users to Vudu. The companies announced today that Vudu is “the official new streaming platform for consumers of AMC Theatres on Demand.”</p><p>AMC launched its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-15-amc-on-demand-streaming.html">on-demand streaming service</a> in 2019, and its popularity surged during pandemic-era lockdowns. In 2020, as moviegoers largely avoided theaters, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/universal-amc-theater-window-222954241.html">partnered with Universal</a> to allow the studio’s films to jump to premium video-on-demand (PVOD) platforms — including AMC’s service — only 17 days after premiering in theaters. However, as viewing habits have readjusted in the last three years, AMC has now decided to offload the service to a frequent partner instead.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Vudu says AMC Theatres On Demand customers will have their content libraries automatically upgraded “to the highest quality format available on Vudu, including 4K Ultra HD.” In addition, new Vudu accounts moving from AMC’s service will get 15 percent off every purchase for their first month on the platform.</p><p>Fandango Media, a joint venture between NBCUniversal and Warner Bros. Discovery, currently owns Vudu. Walmart <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-02-22-wal-mart-buying-vudu-streaming-movie-service.html">bought</a> the platform in 2010 and ran it for a decade before <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fandango-vudu-deal-walmart-streaming-192652676.html">selling it to Fandango Media</a> in 2020 for an undisclosed amount. Its new owner then rolled FandangoNow, its previous standalone streaming service, into the platform in 2021, keeping the name Vudu for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vudu-fandangonow-merge-111549415.html">resulting product</a>.</p><p>The companies didn’t reveal any business details of the handoff. “As we continue to evolve our business and remain focused on Making Movies Better by enhancing the theatrical experience, we’re even more excited to expand our relationship with a trusted partner, who will ensure a continued preeminent experience for those consumers who are streaming their post-theatrical movies at home,” said Nikkole Denson-Randolph, AMC Senior VP of Content Strategy &amp; Inclusive Programming.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/amc-transfers-its-on-demand-streaming-users-to-vudu-140033151.html?src=rss

## The best password managers for 2023
 - [https://www.engadget.com/best-password-manager-134639599.html?src=rss](https://www.engadget.com/best-password-manager-134639599.html?src=rss)

<p>You might’ve seen password managers in the news recently because of the <a href="https://blog.lastpass.com/2022/12/notice-of-recent-security-incident/">breach affecting LastPass customers</a>. We need to trust that all of our logins, banking credentials and other sensitive information has been neatly locked away, only accessible by us when we need it. But most tech is fallible, and the benefits of unique, strong passwords across your online presence outweigh the risks. Password managers remain a great way to securely store all of the credentials you need on a regular basis. We tested out nine of the best password managers available now to help you choose the right one for your needs.</p><h2>How do password managers work?</h2><p>Think of password managers like virtual safe deposit boxes. They hold your valuables, in this case usually online credentials, in a section of the vault only accessible to you by security key or a master password. Most of these services have autofill features that make it convenient to log in to any site without needing to remember every password you have, and they keep your credit card information close for impulse purchases.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But given that passwords are one of the <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/choosing-and-protecting-passwords">top ways to keep your online identity secure</a>, the real value of password managers is staying safe online. “It's just not possible without a password manager to have unique, long and hard-to-guess passwords,” Florian Schaub, an associate professor of information and of electrical engineering and computer science at the University of Michigan, said.</p><p>Common guidance states that passwords should be unique, with the longest number of characters allowed and uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. This is the exact opposite of using the same password everywhere, with minor variations depending on a site’s requirements. Think of how many sites you have credentials on — it’s an impossible task to remember it all without somewhere to store them safely (no, a sticky note on your desk won’t cut it). Password managers are more readily accessible and offer the benefit of filling in those long passwords for you.</p><h2>Are password managers safe?</h2><p>It seems counterintuitive to store all your sensitive information in one place. One hack could mean you lose it all to an attacker and struggle for months or even years to rebuild your online presence, not to mention you may have to cancel credit cards and other accounts. But most experts in the field agree that password managers are a generally secure and safe way to keep track of your data, and the benefits of strong, complex passwords outweigh the possible risks.</p><p>The mechanics of keeping those passwords safe differs slightly from provider to provider. Generally, you have a lengthy, complex “master password” that safeguards the rest of your information. In some cases, you might also get a “security key” to enter when you log in to new devices. This is a random string of letters, numbers and symbols that the company will send you at sign up. Only you know this key, and because it’s stored locally on your device or printed out on paper, it’s harder for hackers to find.</p><p>These multiple layers of security make it difficult for an attacker to get into your vault even if your password manager provider experiences a breach. But the company should also follow a few security basics. A “zero-knowledge” policy means that the company keeps none of your data on file, so in the event of an attack, there’s nothing for hackers to find. Regular pentests and security audits keep the company up to par on best practices, and other efforts like bug bounty programs or hosting on an open source website encourage constant vigilance for security flaws. Most password managers now also offer some level of encryption falling under the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). AES 256-bit is the strongest, because there are the most number of possible combinations, but AES 128-bit or 192-bit are still good.</p><h2>Who are password managers for?</h2><p>Given their universal benefit, pretty much everyone could use a password manager. They’re not just for the tech-savvy people or businesses anymore because so much sensitive information ends up online behind passwords, from our bank accounts to our Netflix watch history.</p><p>That’s the other perk of password managers: safe password sharing. Families, friends or roommates can use them to safely access joint accounts. Texting a password to someone isn’t secure, and you can help your family break the habit by starting to use one yourself, Lisa Plaggemier, executive director at National Cyber Security Alliance, said. Streaming is the obvious use case, but consider the shared bills, file storage and other sites you share access with the people around you as well.</p><h2>Are password managers worth it?</h2><p>You likely already use a password manager, even if you wouldn’t think to call it that. Most phones and web browsers include a log of saved credentials on the device, like the “passwords” keychain in the settings of an iPhone. That means you’ve probably seen the benefits of not having to memorize passwords or even type them out already.</p><p>While that’s a great way in, the downfall of these built-in options are that they tend to be device specific. If you rely on an Apple password manager, for example, that works if you’re totally in the Apple ecosystem — but you become limited once you get an Android tablet, Lujo Bauer, professor of electrical and computer engineering, and of computer science, at Carnegie Mellon University, said. If you use different devices for work and personal use and want a secure way to share passwords with others, or just don’t want to be tied to one brand forever, a third-party password manager is usually worth it.</p><h2>How we tested</h2><p>We tested password managers by downloading each of the nine contenders on iPhone, Android, Safari, Chrome and Firefox. That helped us better understand what platforms each manager was available on, and see how support differs across operating systems and browsers.</p><p>As we got set up with each, we took note of how they iterated on the basic features of autofill and password generators. Nearly all password managers have these features, but some place limits on how much you can store while others give more control over creating easy-to-type yet complex passwords. From there, we looked at extra features like data-breach monitoring to understand which managers offered the most for your money.</p><p>Finally, we reviewed publicly available information about security specs for each. This includes LastPass, which more experts are shying away from recommending after the recent breach. For the sake of this review, we’ve decided not to recommend LastPass at this time as fallout from the breach still comes to light (The company <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/lastpass-engineer-breach-security-roundup/">disclosed a second incident earlier this year </a>where an unauthorized attack accessed the company’s cloud storage, including sensitive data).</p><h2>Password managers we tested</h2><ul><li><p><a class="rapid-with-clickid"

with their private information and, after testing it out, it’s clear why. The service includes industry standard encryption, a “secret key” that only you know on top of your master password, a zero-knowledge policy that means it keeps no data, and other security features like frequent audits and a bug bounty program.</p><p>Plus, it has a pretty intuitive feel. A tutorial at download helps you import passwords from other managers onto 1Password so that you don’t feel like you’re starting over from scratch. It also clearly rates the strength of each password and has an “open and fill” option in the vault so that you can get into your desired site even more quickly. We also liked the option to scan a set up code to easily connect your account to your mobile devices without too much tedious typing.</p><p>At $3 per month, the individual subscription comes with unlimited passwords, items and one gigabyte of document storage for your vault. It also lets you share passwords, credit card information and other saved credentials. If you upgrade to the family plan for $5 each month, you’ll get to invite up to five people (plus more for $1 each per month) to be a part of the vault.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Number of tiers:</strong> 4</p></li><li><p><strong>Pricing:</strong> $3/month for Individual, $5/month for Families, $20/month for Teams Starter Pack, $8/month per user for Business</p></li></ul><h2>Best free password manager: Bitwarden</h2><p></p><p><a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden’s</a> free plan includes unlimited passwords on an unlimited number of devices, which is more than we’ve seen from some of its competitors. There are drawbacks like you can only share vault items with one other user, but we think that’s a fair tradeoff.</p><p>Bitwarden is based on open-source code, meaning anyone on GitHub can audit it, which is a good measure of security. On a personal level, it includes security audits of your information, like a data breach report, that can keep you in the know about when your passwords have been leaked and when it's time to change them. Plus, it’s widely available across the platforms we tested with a level of customization, options to access your vault and more.</p><p>Bitwarden may be the best free password manager, but it does have a paid version and we do think it’s worth it. At $10 annually for individuals or $40 for families, you unlock encrypted file storage, emergency access, unlimited sharing and more. But the free version comes with the basics that can get anyone set up on password management easily.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Number of tiers:</strong> 3</p></li><li><p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free, $3/month per user for Teams Organization, $5/month per user for Enterprise Organization</p></li></ul><h2>Best cross-platform availability: NordPass</h2><p></p><p>Across password managers we tested, cross-platform availability was relatively similar. Most are widely available across web browsers and different operating systems, including our other top picks on this list. But we wanted to give a nod to <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL25vcmRwYXNzLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImE2NDlkOWQ2LTEwYzMtMzVhZi05NGMyLWRmZTkxOTI1MTU2YSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAXc3dvFt_FBTUl4eh8nwWwcOj_8uRtp4H_WvfMoCusWk&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fnordpass.com%2F">NordPass</a> here because of how easy the service makes it to access your vault from any platform.</p><p>NordPass has a free option with unlimited passwords and syncs across devices. A $2-per-month premium subscription keeps you logged in when switching devices, comes with security notifications and allows for item sharing. A family subscription comes with six premium accounts and only costs $4 per month. This makes it a pretty good budget option as well. Besides the pairing code to connect accounts, NordPass is a pretty standard password manager. Scanning a code gets me from my laptop to mobile device to work computer super easily. If you’re constantly switching devices and those extra few seconds save your sanity, it’s worth considering.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Number of tiers:</strong> 3</p></li><li><p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free, $2/per month for Premium, $4/month for Family</p></li></ul><h2>Best for shared access: Dashlane</h2><p></p><p><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=05a8faef-22e0-48ab-a365-0cc59778dc54&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Dashlane&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIwNWE4ZmFlZi0yMmUwLTQ4YWItYTM2NS0wY2M1OTc3OGRjNTQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFzaGxhbmUuY29tLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYTY0OWQ5ZDYtMTBjMy0zNWFmLTk0YzItZGZlOTE5MjUxNTZhIn0&amp;signature=AQAAATgyIRk0s8jpy1K1ohYYrEeJBH8EG2HW8Y3B-l7cs7a-&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dashlane.com%2F">Dashlane</a> has four subscription options: A free user gets access to one device with unlimited passwords; an advanced user pays $3 per month to get upgraded to unlimited devices and dark web monitoring; for $5 per month, a premium user also gets VPN access and an $7.49-per-month family plan includes access for up to 10 people.</p><p>It met all the criteria we looked for, but with a clear emphasis on sharing credentials. Dashlane highlights “secure sharing” starting at its free level, which is a feature that some competitors keep behind a paywall. Access for up to 10 members in a family plan is one of the bigger plans we’ve seen as well. While we were testing it, password sharing seemed front of mind with a tab dedicated to it in Dashlane’s browser extension. Arguably the biggest caveat here, though, is lack of Linux support.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Number of tiers:</strong> 4</p></li><li><p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free, $3/month for Advanced, $5/month for Premium, $7/month for Friends and Family</p></li></ul>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-password-manager-134639599.html?src=rss

## BeReal is testing a direct messaging feature called RealChat

<p>BeReal was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-morning-after-be-real-apple-app-store-awards-121556627.html">Apple's iPhone app of the year</a> for 2022, but buzz around the social media app (that forces you to post daily selfies) has died down of late. Now, the French company has introduced &quot;RealChat&quot; private messaging, allowing it to boast a feature found on most major social media apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/01/bereal-is-adding-a-messaging-feature-called-realchat/https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/01/bereal-is-adding-a-messaging-feature-called-realchat/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> has reported.&nbsp;</p><p>The function is one of the most requested, the company said. You can only message another user if you're friends with them on the platform. For a message to be deleted, both parties have to do so — deleting your own message won't delete it from a friend's app. The chat system will reportedly feature blocking and reporting features.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>BeReal has an interesting and somewhat messy approach to social media. It sends notifications at a different time each day, prompting you to quickly share photos taken with your phone's front and rear cameras simultaneously. You have a two-minute window to do so, forcing you to share spontaneous moments without spending extra time to make sure the photos are perfect. Friends are notified when you're late or revise a post.</p><p>Earlier this year, BeReal <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bereal-says-it-has-more-than-20-million-daily-active-users-172721921.html">refuted</a> an <a href="https://petapixel.com/2023/02/22/bereal-may-be-on-the-out-users-have-nearly-halved-since-peak/#:~:text=According%252520to%252520the%252520report%25252C%252520BeReal,3.3%252520million%252520in%252520January%2525202023.">analytics report</a> that engagement on the app had fallen significantly, saying it still had 20 million daily active users. The company admitted that while it's been busy behind the scenes, it hasn't released many new features of late, so &quot;people have been guessing what we've been up to and how things are going, and not always accurately.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the past couple of months, though it has launched an <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-04-19/our-new-integration-allows-you-to-share-music-and-podcasts-on-bereal-heres-how/">integration with Spotify</a> showing what you're listening to when you post, along with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bereal-says-it-has-more-than-20-million-daily-active-users-172721921.html">Bonus BeReal</a> feature that lets you post more than one BeReal if you post on time. As with other social media apps, the RealChat feature looks like a way to boost time spent on the app and allow friends to comment privately on posts.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/bereal-is-testing-a-direct-messaging-feature-called-realchat-132602404.html?src=rss

## Android can now 'remix' emojis and help with reading practice

<p>Google has listed a bunch of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-mwc-2023-feature-update-android-wear-os-112426636.html">features</a> rolling out to the Android ecosystem starting today, June 1st, and one of them can help new readers improve their diction and vocabulary. The new reading practice tool for phones and tablets is available with thousands of compatible children's books on Play Books. It challenges kids or people who've only started to learn English to read sentences with the mic on. The buttons that show up when they tap help allow them to quickly look up the definition of words or to hear the sentence be read out loud for guidance. It's now available in the English language for users in the US, as long as they have a device running Android 8 and above.&nbsp;</p><p>The tech giant is also rolling out new widgets that show entertainment suggestions for Google TV, stock trading information from Google Finance and curated stories from Google News. These widgets will be available for everyone with devices running Android 6 and later in all supported languages. Meanwhile, for those tired of the usual emoji options, there's a new tool called &quot;Emoji Kitchen.&quot; It lets users fuse and remix emoji available on Gboard — so long as they have a compatible combination — and then turn them into stickers they can send.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Users with devices running WearOS 2 now have new Spotify tiles and watchface complications to choose from. Spotify DJ, available in US, Canada, UK and Ireland for premium subscribers, can play a personalized selection of tracks or stream episodes from the user's favorite podcasts the moment they press play on the new smartwatch tile. WearOS 3.0 users can now also add a tile for a single to-do list from Google Notes. Those living in Washington, DC and the San Francisco Bay Area are getting something extra: They now have the option to load their SmartTrip and Clipper cards to their Google Wallet, so they can tap and pay to ride local transportation using their smartwatches.&nbsp;</p><div id="c7bb3c65da1c4eadb279ae3e92fa0426"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>Aside from all these features, which have only started rolling out, Google has also announced that its One subscription service's dark web report is fully available in the US. Subscribers will be able to run scans to check if their Gmail addresses have been exposed in the dark web. They can also check if any sensitive information, such as their social security numbers, have been compromised. Plus, they can choose to start automatically monitoring the dark web for their personal information, so they'd get notified as soon as any of their details get posted. Dark web monitoring is only available to Google One customers in the US at the moment, but Google plans to expand its availability to more than 20 countries in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/android-can-now-remix-emojis-and-help-with-reading-practice-130053394.html?src=rss

## NVIDIA's Neuralangelo is an AI model that can generate 3D objects from 2D videos

<p>NVIDIA has introduced a new AI model called <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2023/06/01/neuralangelo-ai-research-3d-reconstruction/">Neuralangelo</a> that can create 3D replicas of objects from 2D videos, whether they're classic sculptures or run-of-the-mill trucks and buildings. Neuralangelo works by selecting several frames showing the subject from different angles in a 2D video, so it can a get a clear picture of its depth, size and shape. It then creates a rough 3D representation of the object before optimizing it to mimic the details of the real thing.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the company, the new model has adopted the technology from its old one, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-instant-nerf-artificial-intelligence-130015116.html">Instant NeRF</a>, to be able to accurately capture the finer details of whatever the user wants to recreate in 3D. Those include its texture, patterns and color variations. NVIDIA says Neuralangelo's ability to capture tricky textures, such as the roughness of roof shingles and the smoothness of marble, &quot;significantly surpasses prior methods.&quot; It's apparently even good enough to create usable virtual objects from videos taken by smartphones, which could give creators an easy way to generate 3D recreations for their projects. It's a quick solution, too: NVIDIA Research told us the tool can create 3D scenes within two hours.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Ming-Yu Liu, co-author of the paper on Neuralangelo, said it will &quot;eventually enable developers to import detailed objects — whether small statues or massive buildings — into virtual environments for video games or industrial digital twins.&quot; In the video below showing what the technology can do, NVIDIA said it can create large-scale vistas from drone footage, making it easier for developers to recreate real locations in their games. It has a lot of other potential applications, as well, including in robotics, virtual reality experiences, architecture and, of course, art.</p><div id="5215c685ee054e339798c5e6fdfa9b0c"></div><p>The company's research arm will present Neuralangelo at the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition event that's taking place on June 18th through the 22nd in Vancouver.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/nvidias-neuralangelo-is-an-ai-model-that-can-generate-3d-objects-from-2d-videos-130023299.html?src=rss

However, that doesn’t make them immune to rapid power drain when they’re constantly in use. If your dad is one to complain about having no juice left while out and about, a battery pack like <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMEI0NjlMV0Y0Lz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby0xMHQtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImRmZDM2ZWRjLWVmZGYtM2E3Ny04NjVhLWNiZjE4YTI0OGQ2YiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAU20e0hlAO7KAQTVouWcQd5j8HuCYo7CyGZ4QXLZ9FVF&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0B469LWF4%2F">Anker’s MagGo</a> is a solid option. Removing the need for cables, the MagGo battery pack utilizes Apple’s MagSafe technology and snaps to the back of compatible iPhones and will begin charging wirelessly. Often half the price of Apple’s own <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BcHBsZS1NSldZM0FNLUEtTWFnU2FmZS1CYXR0ZXJ5L2RwL0IwOTlCV1k3V1QvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTEwdC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZGZkMzZlZGMtZWZkZi0zYTc3LTg2NWEtY2JmMThhMjQ4ZDZiIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAXQ-32dt6WvM7GwtxhWmmQwpVXR1lZpy8UUezJV8dwsD&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-MJWY3AM-A-MagSafe-Battery%2Fdp%2FB099BWY7WT%2F">MagSafe Battery Pack</a>, Anker’s version comes in a range of different colors and also features a small kickstand that lets dad rotate the phone to either portrait or landscape mode when the need arises.</p><h2>Nintendo $50 eShop Gift Card</h2><p></p><p>If dad has a Nintendo Switch (or one of the company’s handhelds), then he’s probably already pretty up-to-speed on the Nintendo eShop. Every so often, the company will reduce a wide range of first-party and indie games, allowing you and dad to build out your collection for a lot less. The good news is that throughout the year, retailers will often offer discounts on <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2Ftem4udG8vM0c2bVRMRyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZGZkMzZlZGMtZWZkZi0zYTc3LTg2NWEtY2JmMThhMjQ4ZDZiIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAfJNb25SF0g4-vtHHLGz51xtwTI2ywB_sNfmy2iaBrQe&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Famzn.to%2F3G6mTLG">eShop credit</a>, which when combined with an existing sale, can lighten dad’s overall spend on games. Deals are often around 10 percent off, meaning you may be able to secure a $50 card for just $45.</p><h2>1Password subscription</h2><p></p><p>If dad has passwords with “123456” in it, instead of shaming him, consider directing him to a password manager instead. Sure, most browsers come with their own built-in password tools, but <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=29d07367-7ffa-4e05-9a7f-c1dd19430630&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=1Password&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyOWQwNzM2Ny03ZmZhLTRlMDUtOWE3Zi1jMWRkMTk0MzA2MzAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly8xcGFzc3dvcmQuY29tLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZGZkMzZlZGMtZWZkZi0zYTc3LTg2NWEtY2JmMThhMjQ4ZDZiIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAfu0oq32_ohcdXf1lg871Hg53EDeO7CyqyljPFtqYI42&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2F1password.com%2F">1Password’s subscription service</a> operates across a wide variety of devices, browsers and operating systems. It’ll save all of his passwords and suggest stronger ones and handle two-factor authentication requests but that’s not all: Give it addresses, card details and other important information and it’ll reduce the time and effort it takes to fill in all of those annoying online forms.</p><h2>Blink Mini Camera</h2><p></p><p>From unwanted intruders to porch pirates, security cams are a very useful tool not only as a deterrent, but also to capture irrefutable proof of wrongdoing. Blink has a wide range of indoor and outdoor home security products, but its <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9CbGluay1NaW5pLXBsdWctc2VjdXJpdHktZGV0ZWN0aW9uL2RwL0IwN1g2QzlSTUY_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMTB0LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkZmQzNmVkYy1lZmRmLTNhNzctODY1YS1jYmYxOGEyNDhkNmIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAbyk9GzD3fm6TRWjQy8qNvh3t8nuiPVqTAQQLi594nyZ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBlink-Mini-plug-security-detection%2Fdp%2FB07X6C9RMF%3F">basic 1080p indoor plug-in camera</a> is a solid choice for keeping an eye on pets, but also unwelcome guests in the dead of night. It comes with two-way audio, allowing dad to covertly startle a friend or family member, and motion detection, letting him focus on the specific areas of the home. The Blink Mini also ties in perfectly with Alexa, so it’s a solid choice for families who already own an Echo device.</p><h2>Tapo Matter Supported Smart Plug Mini 3-Pack</h2><p></p><p>One of the most important parts of building a smart home is incorporating all of the non-smart electronics like appliances and lighting into the network. <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9UUC1MaW5rLVRhcG8tU3VwcG9ydGVkLVAxMjVNLTMtUGFjay9kcC9CMEJYTU5KRFczLz90aD0xJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTEwdC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZGZkMzZlZGMtZWZkZi0zYTc3LTg2NWEtY2JmMThhMjQ4ZDZiIn0&amp;signature=AQAAATlcu5x4hT9i4nsvcgWtslc0TWd3Aro5ciF4zsbxVvxW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FTP-Link-Tapo-Supported-P125M-3-Pack%2Fdp%2FB0BXMNJDW3%2F%3Fth%3D1">Tapo’s Smart Plug Mini outlets</a> are basic in nature, they serve as a simple on or off switch for things like that antique lamp mom and dad bought to go with their coffee table. Tapo’s app pairing is super simple and the plugs will soon support the new Matter standard, as well as both Google Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa. That means dad will be able to create smart home routines that feature devices that weren’t necessarily designed to support them.</p><h2>Fire TV Stick 4K</h2><p></p><p>Most newer TV models come with their own set of apps, but often the older, slower <em>dumb </em>television in the back room needs some love too. <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDhYVllaMVk1P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTEwdC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZGZkMzZlZGMtZWZkZi0zYTc3LTg2NWEtY2JmMThhMjQ4ZDZiIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAdRLPM3fsx9w0-61KtdAzWgdcn5x8M_AO-qiqx7EjF1q&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08XVYZ1Y5%3F">Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K</a> delivers all of the major streaming apps you need and ensures that they’re regularly updated to include all of the latest features.

It’s also perfect for eyeglasses, should dad need to repair them too.</p><h2>JLab Go Air Pop earbuds</h2><p></p><p>Listening to music on-the-go doesn’t need to be expensive. <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2Ftem4udG8vMzlIRXlnVSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZGZkMzZlZGMtZWZkZi0zYTc3LTg2NWEtY2JmMThhMjQ4ZDZiIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAVl8r4M-oHyTF7LEI20sKc0b6PN-sOF_YPvVRmYn5Ipt&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Famzn.to%2F39HEygU">JLab’s Go Air Pop</a> wireless earbuds are a perfect example of that. For just $20 (sometimes less), these small but colorful Bluetooth buds offer on-board touch controls, the ability to use either earbud independently, EQ presets and IPX4 moisture resistance (meaning they’ll survive a low-pressure spray of water). They’re also really solid in the battery life department, too: the Go Air Pops will provide dad up to eight hours on a charge but the case will give you three additional charges before you need to plug the entire set in.</p><h2>Fitbit Aria Air smart scale</h2><p></p><p>Nobody is saying that dad needs to lose or gain weight, but he’s looking for a better way to track his body measurements then a smart scale could help.

If dad already has a Fitbit smartwatch or tracker, it’ll put it alongside his existing exercise data, giving him a nice snapshot of his overall fitness and body health.</p><h2>SanDisk 512GB Extreme microSD</h2><p></p><p>Portable memory and storage might not be a glamorous gift, but they play a vital part in extending today’s tech gadgets.

Its standard price is over $100, but we wanted to mention it here since you can often find it for around $50.</p><h2>Amazon Smart Thermostat</h2><p></p><p>No smart home is complete without a smart thermostat handling all of the family’s heating and hot water needs.

<p>Polestar has announced its <a href="https://media.polestar.com/us/en/media/pressreleases/667903">latest over-the-air upgrade for the Polestar 2 EV</a>, and it includes an integrated YouTube app right on the home screen. Volvo, a part-owner of Polestar, first mentioned its plan to make <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volvo-google-home-youtube-180057471.html">YouTube available for its infotainment in 2022</a> — though it was through the Play Store. While you don't want to be watching YouTube videos as you cruise down the road (or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-touchscreen-video-games-driving-165327545.html">play video games, Tesla</a>), Polestar specifically denotes it as a way to entertain yourself while the car charges.&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, the update is solely so you can amuse yourself while sitting in the stationary car, but sure, when you drop a minimum of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/polestar-raises-the-price-of-its-single-motor-polestar-2-by-2500-130015417.html">$40,000 to $50,000 on an EV</a>, why shouldn't it provide entertainment while juicing up?&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There are also some new features for when you hit the road, including Apple CarPlay's expanded information about calls or media on the home screen. Plus, you can control calls through the steering wheel (as you can in most cars) and, more uniquely, see calls and Apple Maps right on the driver display.&nbsp;</p><p>The last bit of Polestar 2's updates focus the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volvo-polestar-range-assistant-optimizer-194501187.html">Range Assistant app</a>, with a major upgrade giving you more control over your energy efficiency, with consumption monitoring extended beyond 20, 40, or 100 miles. The update also factors environmental changes and related variables into your projected range — with real-time information available right on the driver display. Previously, this figure was a default range projection rather than one specific to you. The P2.9 over-the-air update has begun rolling out, so keep an eye out for when it reaches your EV.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/polestar-2-update-adds-youtube-integration-and-new-carplay-features-115027133.html?src=rss

## The Morning After: What to expect from Apple’s WWDC 2023

<p>Apple’s big developer conference kicks off June 5th, and all the signs point to the company’s mixed reality headset <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-wwdc-2023-what-to-expect-from-ios-17-to-new-macbooks-160033810.html">making its first appearance</a>. The tech giant has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-30-apple-buys-startup-ar-lenses.html"><ins>acquiring headset-friendly startups</ins></a> for years, and if the rumors are true, Apple’s stand-alone device (possibly called Reality Pro) may be more powerful than the Meta Quest Pro and many other high-end headsets. It could pack 4K resolution per eye, with full body-motion tracking. It may require an external battery pack and last for just two hours on a charge, but it would be relatively light and slim.</p><p>It will also likely land with a new platform (maybe called xrOS) designed with mixed reality in mind. Instead of controllers, you’d use hand gestures, gaze detection and voice commands to navigate. It sounds like Apple is approaching the cutting-edge of mixed reality, but that comes at a cost: Rumors suggest this first model could cost around $3,000. That’s three times the price of Meta’s Quest Pro.</p><p>We’re also expecting to see a new 15-inch addition to the MacBook Air series with M2 power, as well as the first look at iOS 17 and MacOS 14. We’re heading to the conference to report on everything next week.</p><p>– Mat Smith</p><p></p><h3>The biggest stories you might have missed</h3><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/you-can-watch-the-entire-first-season-of-star-trek-strange-new-worlds-for-free-on-youtube-183553558.html"><ins>You can watch the entire first season of 'Star Trek: Strange New Worlds’ for free on YouTube</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-fathers-day-gift-ideas-123012557.html"><ins>The best Father's Day tech gift ideas</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/logitech-mx-anywhere-3s-hands-on-a-nearly-ideal-travel-mouse-specs-price-availability-070134836.html"><ins>Logitech MX Anywhere 3s hands-on: An almost ideal travel mouse </ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-has-officially-stopped-supporting-the-first-gen-chromecast-095205330.html"><ins>Google has officially stopped supporting the first-gen Chromecast </ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-ipads-how-to-pick-the-best-apple-tablet-for-you-150054066.html"><ins>The best iPads for 2023 </ins></a></p><p></p><p><em>The Morning After isn’t just a</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/"><em> newsletter</em></a><em> –  it’s also a daily podcast.

## Orange Amps offers analog warmth with its first line of Bluetooth speakers

<p>It seems that guitar amp companies making Bluetooth speakers could be the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/marshall-middleton-bluetooth-speaker-flagship-weatherproof-150059250.html">new</a><a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=ed81ca97-132a-418f-b517-4a4564364034&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Fender&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJlZDgxY2E5Ny0xMzJhLTQxOGYtYjUxNy00YTQ1NjQzNjQwMzQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZmVuZGVyLmNvbS9lbi1VUy9hdWRpby9ibHVldG9vdGgtc3BlYWtlcnMvZmVuZGVyLWF1ZGlvLXJpZmYtYmx1ZXRvb3RoLXNwZWFrZXIvOTE5MDAyMTAxNS5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIxMTZjZmQxYS0xNmE1LTQ3ZWEtODI2OC1lMzc0MDNhNDkwNTIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdPXfdHdAZwRj3DWPxsDzmxjz7S3AnIv7eLmh2Ed70e0&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fender.com%2Fen-US%2Faudio%2Fbluetooth-speakers%2Ffender-audio-riff-bluetooth-speaker%2F9190021015.html">thing</a>. UK-based <a href="https://orangeamps.com/">Orange Amps</a> has just launched a duo of Bluetooth speakers called the <a href="https://orangeamps.com/product/orange-box/">Box</a> and <a href="https://orangeamps.com/product/orange-box-l/">Box-L</a>. The first is a battery-powered portable model, while the latter is a wired option that’s more of a homebody. Both echo the design of this iconic brand’s guitar amplifier and speaker series, using the same colors, logo and control panel style. The specs hint at decent stereo sound in the $300-$350 price range with Bluetooth 5.0, aptX support, a Class D amp for the subwoofer and Class AB analog amplifiers to help the full-range drivers produce a warmer sound. There are some deviations from what you'd expect, however, like the absence of USB charging, a front-facing only design and the lack of any weatherproofing or IP rating.</p><p>The Orange Box is the slightly smaller of the two models at 11 x 6.9 x 6.7-inches and 6.6 pounds with a vegan-leather carrying strap. You can choose between the classic orange exterior or a black version and it's priced at $299 (£275). There’s a 4-inch subwoofer powered by a 30W Class D amp and a pair of 2-inch full-range drivers powered by dual 10W Class AB analog amplifiers for a warmer sound.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="A cropped image shows someone in jeans and wearing chunky rings holding the Orange Amps Box portable Bluetooth speaker by its carrying strap." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/7e6b3d20-ffc9-11ed-bfb3-5db0cf612cdf" /><figcaption>The Orange Box portable Bluetooth speaker.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Orange Amps</div></figure><p>The specs for the battery-powered Box list a charging time of three hours until full and a runtime of 15 or more hours. It also lists a 2,600mAh li-ion battery, so we’re interested in a real world test. There’s no USB port, so you’re stuck with the DC19.5V charging cable that comes in the box.</p><p>The wired model is called the Box-L and it’s slightly larger at 13.8 x 7.9 x 7.9-inches and 9.6 pounds. It’s also available in orange or black and priced at $345 (£315). As mentioned, there’s no onboard battery, so it’s more of a sedentary beast. You can expect a slightly beefier sound, however, with a larger 5-inch subwoofer powered by the Class D amp and two 2-inch full-range drivers powered by dual 10W analog Class AB versions.</p><figure><img alt="An Orange Amps Box-L wired Bluetooth speaker with a black exterior sits on a granite kitchen countertop." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/c05b9450-ffc9-11ed-b7fe-5d0dde92254f" /><figcaption>The Orange Amps Box-L wired Bluetooth speaker.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Orange Amps</div></figure><p>Both models have a 50W RMS output and a frequency range of 35Hz - 20kHz, so we expect they’ll probably have a decent amount of bass. They also support Qualcomm aptX for high resolution audio, alongside AAC and SBC.</p><p>The general physical design is the same for both the Box and Box-L. The core framework is made of wood, with a tolex (vinyl) covering. At the top you get a control panel with knobs and switches, much like those found on the brand’s line of guitar amps. There’s a power toggle, battery indicator light, knobs for bass, treble and volume adjustment, as well as a 3.5mm aux input. In addition, there’s a Bluetooth pairing button that does double duty as a play/pause control and a small audio limiter light to let you know if you're driving the system too hard. The company claims to support the right to repair and will offer replacement parts in case you just can’t help yourself from pushing the speaker too hard and break something.</p><p>Both models are available today in the USA, UK and the rest of the world at the <a href="https://orangeamps.com/products/">Orange Amps website</a> as well as Amazon. Although, in Australia you may have to stick with ordering through either Amazon or the company’s regional distributor <a href="https://orangeamps.com/location/australis-music-group-pty-ltd/">Australis Music Group</a>. The portable <a href="https://orangeamps.com/product/orange-box/">Orange Box</a> is priced at $299 (£275) and the <a href="https://orangeamps.com/product/orange-box-l/">wired Orange Box-L</a> is $345 (£315).</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/orange-amps-offers-analog-warmth-with-its-first-line-of-bluetooth-speakers-110058439.html?src=rss

## Fiat's Topolino EV is an Italian twist on the Citroen Ami

<p>Fiat already has its own cute EV in the 500 series, but it has now gone even tinier in its latest urban mobility push. The company unveiled the <a href="https://www.media.stellantis.com/em-en/fiat/press/the-new-fiat-topolino-the-cutest-way-to-electrify-cities?adobe_mc_ref=">Topolino</a>, essentially a rebadged version of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hands-on-citroen-ami-ev-133032057.html">Citroen Ami</a> with a redesigned front end, brown cloth retractable roof, open sides and cream leather seats.&nbsp;</p><p>The Topolino shares Ami's drivetrain (both Citroen and Fiat are under the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020/07/17/stellantis-fca-chrysler-name-change/">Stellantis</a> umbrella) and looks nigh-on identical, apart from the aforementioned tweaks. It has a 5.5kWh battery that delivers a 47 mile range, and it'll hit a top speed of 28MPH. Fiat didn't share any interior images, but the only tech inside an Ami is a charging port and phone holder.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Like the Ami, the Topolino is technically a &quot;quadricycle&quot; and not a car, meaning it can be driven in cities without the need for a driver's license. Fiat said it wants to &quot;make young people fall in love with cars again,&quot; while promoting sustainability along with &quot;joy, optimism and fun.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Fiat's wording in the press release suggests that the car will be used to promote its sustainability and mobility aims (the words &quot;sustainable&quot; and &quot;mobility&quot; are used no less than 20 times). &quot;The new Fiat Topolino will play a socially active role in promoting electric mobility in cities and a special role in creating a personal mobility solution for the entire family,&quot; Fiat wrote, adding it fits in with &quot;Fiat’s democratic mission of providing urban sustainable mobility solutions which are accessible to everyone.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Stellantis has set a goal for 100 percent of passenger car sales to be BEVs by 2030, and that date is coming down the pike pretty quickly. Like other automakers, it hasn't showed much in terms of urban mobility options apart from a few tiny EVs. There's no word on pricing, but the Ami can be leased for 25 euros per month with a 3,850 euro down payment.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/fiats-topolino-ev-is-an-italian-twist-on-the-citroen-ami-101849140.html?src=rss

<p>Apple is expected to launch a collection of new products at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in a few days, and two of them might be new Mac desktop computers. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-31/apple-tests-new-high-end-mac-chips-ahead-of-developer-conference?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg's</em></a> Mark Gurman, the tech giant has been testing a couple of high-end Macs powered by its new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-updates-its-mac-book-pros-with-m-2-pro-and-max-chips-143848558.html">M2 Max</a> processor and the M2 Ultra chip that the company has yet to announce.</p><p>If you'll recall, Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-review-2023-m2-pro-max-140048268.html">debuted</a> the M2 Max on its 14- and 16 MacBook Pro laptops, as well as its Mac mini computer earlier this year. The desktop PC with the chip will reportedly have 8 high-performance cores, 4 efficiency cores and 30 graphics cores. It will also have 96 GB of RAM and will run macOS 13.4, the company's latest software for computers, out of the box.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Meanwhile, the unannounced M2 Ultra chip is supposed to be the more powerful option between the two, with twice as many processing cores. Specifically, the chip is expected to have 16 high-performance, 8 efficiency and 60 graphics cores, though <em>Bloomberg</em> says the company will offer a more powerful version with 76 graphics cores. Apple is even reportedly testing the computer with M2 Ultra in configurations with 64GB, 128GB and 192GB of memory.&nbsp;</p><p>Gurman also says that the M2 Ultra was originally designed for future versions of the Mac Pro, which still uses Intel processors. But the Mac Pros are testing at the momentare codenamed Mac 14,8, while the new high-end desktops with the M2 Max and M2 Ultra chips are codenamed Mac 14,13 and Mac 14,14. Presumably, that means they're a different desktop PCs altogether, perhaps new models of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-mac-studio-review-m1-ultra-desktop-130044054.html">Mac Studio</a> that's currently powered by the M1 Max or the M1 Ultra.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to high-end desktop computers, Apple might also launch new laptops at WWDC. Some possibilities include a 15-inch MacBook Air that could be powered by a processor &quot;on par&quot; with the tech giant's current-gen M2 chip, as well as a more affordable version of the 13-inch MacBook Pro.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apple-is-reportedly-testing-high-end-mac-pcs-powered-by-its-new-m2-chips-094545719.html?src=rss

<p>Roger Federer is not only one of the greatest tennis players of all time, but also certified polyglot (he's also on a Swiss coin, was voted most stylish man of the decade and was the best paid athlete in 2020, in case you were feeling good about yourself). Thanks to those skills, he's the first celebrity voice on Waze to give directions in no less than three languages (French, German and English), Google <a href="https://blog.google/waze/drive-with-roger-federer-on-waze/">announced</a>. Federer joins a host of personalities including Morgan Freeman, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bmw-reveals-three-new-evs-for-its-summer-2023-lineup-210725344.html">Liam Neeson</a>, Kevin Hart and others who've loaned their voices to Waze.&nbsp;</p><p>On top of supplying turn-by-turn directions, Federer helps get you pumped up for your commute. &quot;It's drive time — I can feel the adrenaline kick in already,&quot; he says in one recording. &quot;Time to ride! Trust your ability. I'm ready to coach you along the way,&quot; he declares in another. He even has some words of encouragement if you screw up: &quot;Make a U-Turn. Hey, even champions can mess up.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While Google continues to add well-known voices to Waze, Amazon is doing the opposite. Earlier this week, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-ditches-alexa-celebrity-voices-165511851.html">announced</a> that it was ditching Alexa's celebrity voices and would issue refunds upon request. The feature, which originally cost $1 before being boosted to $5, offered voices including Shaquille O’Neal, Melissa McCarthy and Samuel L. Jackson.&nbsp;</p><p>In any case, judging by the responses to <a href="https://twitter.com/waze/status/1663939979603484675">Waze's tweet</a>, Federer fans are more than excited to be guided by that famous, lightly accented voice — perfect for a European road trip.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/roger-federer-can-now-guide-you-on-waze-in-three-languages-084508577.html?src=rss

<p>Faraday Future has officially launched its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/faraday-future-delays-ff91-launch-050427276.html">long delayed</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/faraday-future-finally-starts-ff-91-production-after-repeated-delays-114510625.html">FF 91 electric vehicles</a>, including a limited edition called the <a href="https://www.ff.com/us/design/2022/FF91/options?VEH=FF91FNA-ALLIANCE">Futurist Alliance</a> that carries a pretty hefty price tag of $309,000. As <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2023/05/31/faraday-future-ff-91-2-pricing-announced/"><em>Autoblog</em></a> notes, that's even more expensive than the $249,000 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lucid-air-sapphire-performance-ev-204541286.html">Lucid Air Sapphire</a>, a &quot;ultra-high-performance&quot; EV with similar specs. The company's <a href="https://www.ff.com/us/design/2022/FF91/options?VEH=FF91FNA">FF 91 2.0 Futurist</a> model will sell for the same price as the Air Sapphire at $249,000, while the base FF 91 2.0, which is expected to be the most affordable of the three, doesn't have pricing yet.&nbsp;</p><p>Both the FF91 2.0 Futurist Alliance and Futurist models are powered by three electric motors and can go from 0 to 60mph in 2.27 seconds. The 1050 horsepower vehicles can go as fast as 155 mph, and their 142kWh battery can sustain a range of approximately 381 miles — shorter than the range of a Tesla Model S but longer than a Model Y's. They both have the same &quot;zero gravity&quot; seats that have a large recline angle for comfort, as well as 27-inch rear passenger displays.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>However, the automaker will only produce 300 Futurist Alliance EVs, which will feature an exclusive wheel design and will be available in bright silver, matte silver and matte black. Futurist Alliance owners will also receive exclusive professional track-time training and an Apple Watch loaded with the automaker's vehicle control features. Plus, the first 91 owners will get a high-speed internet satellite communications suite included with their purchase.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to announcing the two models' prices, Faraday Future has also launched the FF aiHypercar+, a &quot;mobility ecosystem product&quot; with a rather vague description at the moment. According to <em>Autoblog</em>, the subscription service will give customers access to some kind of AI assistant personalization and vehicle maintenance. It will cost the first 2,000 users in US and China an eye-watering $14,900 a year, so everyone else will have to be prepared to pay more than that.&nbsp;</p><p>Preorders for the FF91 2.0 Futurist Alliance and Futurist models are now open to interested buyers in the US and China for a deposit of $5,000 and $1,500, respectively. They don't have a delivery date yet, but Faraday Future says its three-phase delivery plan started on May 31st. The company will hold an event for a group of customers it's calling &quot;Industry Expert FPO(s)&quot; on June 6th, after which they'll get the chance to pay for and get the first delivery units.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/faraday-futures-ff-91-electric-vehicles-will-cost-as-much-as-309000-053144006.html?src=rss
