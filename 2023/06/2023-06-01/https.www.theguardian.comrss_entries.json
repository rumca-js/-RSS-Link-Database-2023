Grohl alone the previous year in the months after Kurt Cobain\u2019s suicide. The contemporary press was revealing: the album was not greeted with the universal warmth one might have expected. Interviewers and critics seemed to be suspicious and combative. There was a consensus that the album was selling well due to residual affection for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/nirvana\">Nirvana</a>, or as a kind of mass sympathy vote; that either way, it was unlikely to be a project with legs. One frequent line of questioning involved picking over its lyrics for references to his former band and its late frontman, despite Grohl\u2019s repeated insistence that almost all the songs predated Cobain\u2019s death and that the album was not an act of posthumous reflection or mourning \u2013 whatever grieving he had to do was done in private.</p><p>How times change.

Its tale of growing up in 1980s Northampton is camp, cheeky and clever</p><p>It would take a hard heart not to fall for Changing Ends. It is a steamroller of a comedy, open, welcoming and beaming with easy charm. Written by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/alan-carr\">Alan Carr</a> and Two Doors Down\u2019s Simon Carlyle, it tells the story of Carr\u2019s early life in Northampton, joining him on the precipice of \u201cbig school\u201d in 1986. Carr is not your everyday 11-year-old, with his penchant for scarves, earmuffs and Murder, She Wrote; that he ends up as a confidant of the dinner ladies, and not the football lads, is no great surprise to anyone. Still, it isn\u2019t easy being different in the east Midlands in the 80s and young Alan has issues to deal with on all sides.</p><p>Carr himself appears as a sort of ghost of Christmas yet to come, albeit a more cheerful one, dropping in to scenes to narrate for a while, or crack jokes about the star he would become. But the show belongs to Oliver Savell, who is remarkable as the young Alan. Sometimes, on screen, you can tell when a child actor is just doing their best, but Savell is fantastic and manages to embody the real Carr without it seeming like an impersonation. He is camp, he is cheeky and he gets it just right. He deserves all the acclaim that will inevitably come.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/01/changing-ends-review-alan-carrs-childhood-makes-for-relentlessly-funny-tv\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/01/changing-ends-review-alan-carrs-childhood-makes-for-relentlessly-funny-tv", "date_published": "2023-06-01 05:00:24+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "The backlash: how slavery research came under fire", "description": "<p>\u2022 Read more in this series: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cotton-capital\">Cotton Capital</a></p><p>More and more institutions are commissioning investigations into their historical links to slavery \u2013 but the fallout at one Cambridge college suggests  these projects are meeting growing resistance</p><p>When the historian Nicolas Bell-Romero started a job researching Cambridge University\u2019s past links to transatlantic slavery three years ago, he did not expect to be pilloried in the national press by anonymous dons as \u201ca \u2018woke activist\u2019 with an agenda\u201d.
