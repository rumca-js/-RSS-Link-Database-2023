The US Army trains soldiers for jungle warfare at the 25th Infantry Division's Lightning Academy on the island of Oahu in Hawaii.\n\nInsider's chief video correspondent Graham Flanagan spent 12 days inside the Army's Jungle Operations Training Course, where a cross section of soldiers of various ranks and experience levels learn to fight, move, and survive in the jungle. Eighty students begin the course on day one, but only 51 will make it to graduation. The rest are dropped from the course by failing one of five critical tests.\n\nOn day nine, students begin a three-day culminating exercise that incorporates the skills and lessons taught in the course, such as rope systems, rappelling, survival skills, small-unit tactics, and land navigation. Students who graduate from the course receive the Army\u2019s coveted jungle tab.\n\n00:00 Intro\n1:30 Welcome to the jungle\n2:28 Day 1/in-processing\n4:10 Critical test No. 1: knots\n5:56 Jungle school briefing\n7:15 Day 2/knots retest\n8:17 Critical test No. 2: jungle 5K\n10:09 Critical test No. 3: combat water survival assessment\n14:13 Intro to land navigation\n15:49 Day 3/land-navigation practice\n17:06 Small-unit-tactics training\n17:55 Meeting the students\n21:41 Tension builds in Asia-Pacific region\n22:35 History of jungle school\n23:55 Day 4/traps, tracking, and camouflage\n25:22 Jungle penetrator\n26:43 Day 5/rappelling\n27:36 No. 23\u2019s impact on morale\n29:41 Day 6/critical test No. 4: land navigation\n37:48 Building ruck rafts/old friends reunite\n39:18 Day 7/Survival Village\n42:55 Impact on family life\n44:02 Day 8/building signal fire\n45:23 Chinese spy balloon news\n46:24 Critical test No. 5: rope systems\n48:40 Culex briefing\n49:28 Day 9/first day of culex\n55:00 Day 10/second day of culex\n1:00:53 Day 11/third day of culex\n1:03:35 The Green Mile\n1:06:51 The Dogex\n1:07:30 Day 12/graduation\n\nMORE BOOT CAMP VIDEOS:\nHow the US Military Spends Over $44 Billion On Warplanes | Boot Camp | Insider Business\nhttps://youtu.be/LdsqlMqwmGY\nHow Air Force Pilots Fly The $165 Million Ghostrider \u2014 the \"Ultimate Battle Plane\" | Boot Camp | Insider Business\nhttps://youtu.be/l0CrdJCrZ8Q\nBoot Camp Season Five Marathon | Boot Camp | Insider Business\nhttps://youtu.be/VvUykli9Oqk\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#ArmySoldier #BootCamp #InsiderBusiness\n\nBusiness Insider tells you all you need to know about business, finance, tech, retail, and more.\n\nVisit our homepage for the top stories of the day: https://www.businessinsider.com\nInsider Business on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/businessinsider\nInsider Business on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/insiderbusiness\nInsider Business on Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/businessinsider\nInsider Business on Snapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Business_Insider/5319643143\nInsider Business on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@businessinsider\n\nHow Army Jungle Soldiers Are Training For A Future War With China | Boot Camp | Insider Business", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwBYPgBK_OA", "date_published": "2023-06-01 15:00:19+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
