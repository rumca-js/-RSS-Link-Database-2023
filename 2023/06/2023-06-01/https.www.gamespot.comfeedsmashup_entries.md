<p>Who will play Superman in writer-director James Gunn's Superman Legacy? That's a big question, and one we still don't have the answer to. Yet another name has now surfaced.</p><p><a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/columns/superman-james-gunn-pierson-fode-bold-and-the-beautiful-1235628571/">According to Variety</a>, former Bold and the Beautiful star Pierson Fode is "in the running" for the role. Sources told the site that Fode sent Gunn a tape depicting his own Clark Kent-like small-town origin story from Moses Lake, Washington. Variety said that Gunn liked what he saw.</p><p>Fode is no stranger to the superhero world, as he appeared in an episode of Supergirl in 2020. He also appeared in The Man From Toronto with Kevin Hart and Woody Harrelson. One of his next projects is Based on a True Story with Kaley Cuoco and Chris Messina.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/superman-legacy-casting-rumor-reveals-another-person-who-could-play-the-lead/1100-6514737/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## 2023 Has Been Front-Loaded With Amazing Games

<p dir="ltr">It's not your imagination: The first half of 2023 has been a remarkably great year for video games. In just over five months, we've gotten almost as many critically acclaimed games as we have over an entire calendar year in the past. And while the reasons for this are myriad--including the pandemic impacting game development and subsequent delays--the fact remains that this year is significant, and likely to be remembered as one of the best years in gaming history for some time to come.</p><p dir="ltr">Reviews certainly aren't the only measure of a game's quality, but it's a helpful metric for comparison. According to GameSpot sister site Metacritic, 2023 has already seen five games with an average Metacritic score of 90 or above. Those include, in order:</p><ol><li dir="ltr">The Legend Of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (95)</li><li dir="ltr">Metroid Prime Remastered (94)</li><li dir="ltr">Street Fighter 6 (93)</li><li dir="ltr">Resident Evil 4 (93)</li><li dir="ltr">Diablo 4 (92)</li></ol><p dir="ltr">There are other critically acclaimed games that just barely missed the 90-or-above cut, like Dead Space and Hi-Fi Rush, at a Metacritic score of 89 each. This library of acclaimed games also notably runs the gamut--from open-world adventure to fighting to horror and more. (It is notable, however, that Hi-Fi Rush is the lone new franchise on the list. Sequels and remakes are doing very well, while new IP like Forspoken and Redfall have struggled. That justifiably raises concerns regarding freshness in the gaming industry, which is a related topic worth its own consideration.)</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2023-has-been-front-loaded-with-amazing-games/1100-6514739/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Destiny 2 Update Finally Reduces Weapon Swap Delay

<p>Destiny 2 update 7.1.0.1 comes with a number of simple bug fixes and the arrival of a promised reduction in weapon swap delay. A free Marathon themed goodie is also available for Destiny 2 players.</p><p>The biggest practical change is that weapon swap delay has been reduced from two seconds to less than one second. In May, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-new-weapon-swap-delay-will-be-dialed-back-soon/1100-6514009/">Bungie implemented the weapon swap delay to combat a damage-boosting exploit</a>. With the two-second delay in place, Bungie promised that the delay would be reduced in a future update. That day is now here.</p><p>Other substantive bug fixes include repairing an issue in Salvage where players lost connection to the activity during the Boss encounter. In Bounties and Pursuits, the H.E.L.M. portal previously failed to appear during the In The Depths pursuit, halting progression. That issue has now been fixed. Problems with Guardian Ranks where the Champ title did not count for progress and where the Rank 7 objective Centrifuse was not progressing have also been repaired.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-update-finally-reduces-weapon-swap-delay/1100-6514740/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The Meta Quest Gaming Showcase has wrapped up, and for fans of virtual reality gaming, there's a lot to look forward to in the future. While it'll be getting a bigger reveal at the Ubisoft Forward event, Assassin's Creed Nexus did make a brief appearance today and it was confirmed that it'll be available later this year on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/meta-quest-3-launches-this-fall-price-starts-at-500/1100-6514723/">Quest 3</a> and Quest 2 hardware. Other announcements during the Meta showcase focused on a new look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghostbusters-rise-of-the-ghost-lord/">Ghostbusters: Rise of the Ghost Lord</a>, with the new trailer showing how you'll be able to wield and upgrade iconic Ghostbusters equipment.</p><p>This trailer also had several Easter eggs tied to the Ghostbusters universe hidden inside of it, so if you're up for a scavenger hunt, there are a few nods to the past here that you can track down. Another highlight from the showcase was the reveal of a remake of The 7th Guest, as this new version updates the 1993 spooky classic and uses some interesting technology to create a modern mystery experience. Fans of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/powerwash-simulator/">PowerWash Simulator</a> can soon gear up to blast away some muck--but in VR--and Ghost Signal: A Stellaris Game is getting a free update that will give players more options as they explore the universe.</p><p>One of the big surprises was the reveal of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/bulletstorm/">Bulletstorm</a>, as this VR version of the beloved--and foul-mouthed--first-person shooter is back and once again urges players to get creative with how they take out enemies on a lethal alien planet.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/meta-quest-games-showcase-roundup-stranger-things-vr-bulletstorm-and-more/1100-6514716/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>One of the spookiest CD-ROM games of the '90s, The 7th Guest, is getting a new lease on the afterlife with a remake for virtual reality devices. Announced at the Meta Quest Gaming Showcase, this new version of The 7th Guest, from publisher Vertigo Games and co-developers Vertigo Studios Rotterdam and Exkee, uses volumetric video capture to recreate the full-motion video storytelling of the original game, which takes place in a haunted mansion that's populated by other spirits.</p><div>          </div><p> </p><p>The end result is a surprisingly eerie game that mixes more dynamic environments in VR with head-scratching puzzles and VR-powered optical illusions. As for the ghosts who have organized a little party in Henry Stauf’s haunted mansion, you'll be able to interact with them, and fans of the original game can expect the return of characters like Martine Burden, Brian Dutton, Edward &amp; Elinor Knox, and others, as well as some surprise appearances.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/classic-cd-rom-game-the-7th-guest-is-getting-a-vr-remake/1100-6514714/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Insomniac Games has revealed more details on how switching between Peter Parker and Miles Morales will work in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvels-spider-man-2/">Spider-Man 2</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In an interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-how-character-switching-in-spider-man-2-works">Eurogamer</a>, Bryan Intihar, the game's creative director, said, "When you're playing the main story, we control when you switch between Pete and Miles... it's done in service to the story when we're making those switches, for sure." Intihar explains that whenever you switch between the two, they are pre-determined "based on what we want to do for how the story plays out."</p><p dir="ltr">There'll be moments purely meant for Peter and Miles throughout the game. However, there will also be times when you'll have the option to play as either.

<p>You can pick up acclaimed narrative game Tell Me Why on Steam and Xbox for free this month. The entire game (i.e. all three chapters) is complimentary in June to celebrate Pride month, as the game includes queer characters and themes.</p><p>From Life Is Strange developer Dontnod, Tell Me Why explores the story of twin siblings, Tyler and Alyson Ronan, who have a supernatural bond that allows them to psychically share memories and emotions. After many years away, the pair return to their childhood hometown in Alaska to sell their old family home. However, as they explore the house, forgotten memories from their childhood surface. Tyler and Alyson must use their connection to reveal the past.</p><p>Tell Me Why plays much like Dontnod's previous narrative work. Players control a character, explore environments to uncover the story, and activate supernatural powers to solve puzzles and advance the plot. The emphasis is more on emotional stakes and grounded storytelling than intriguing puzzles or engaged mystery-solving. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tell-me-why-review/1900-6417558/">Tell Me Why review</a>, reviewer Justin Clark gave the game a 7/10 and said, "There's a lot of empty disengaging space to be filled in in this game, but with a little patience and sympathy, what it does provide you is worth the effort."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grab-a-free-game-on-xbox-and-steam-right-now/1100-6514734/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Telltale's The Expanse Features Romance Options And Severed Legs

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-expanse-a-telltale-series/">The Expanse: A Telltale Series</a> shares the same setting as the TV show and book series upon which it is based: a colonized solar system set in the 2300s, where tensions between the U.N.N. (Earth and its moon, Luna), Mars, and residents of the (asteroid) Belt often bubble over into outright hostilities. Starring Camina Drummer--a beloved character from the show played by her television actress, Cara Gee--the game serves as a prequel that allows player choice to control some details of the compelling backstory the development team has created for the character.</p><p dir="ltr">Upon <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-expanse-a-telltale-series-is-a-love-letter-to-fans-of-the-franchise/1100-6514442/">attending the preview event for the game</a>, it became immediately clear to me that Telltale, Deck Nine, and everyone else involved with the game's creation--including Cara Gee herself--cared deeply about the franchise and wanted to maintain as much authenticity as possible. After entering the event space--which was transformed to mimic the interior of a spaceship--I and my fellow attendees were asked to suit up, provided with both a jumpsuit and an LED-powered AR HUD visor, and herded through the "airlock." But it wasn't just the atmosphere that conveyed the developers' commitment to the game--Cara Gee was also in attendance, and her enthusiasm was palpable.</p><p dir="ltr">"We put a lot of our blood, sweat, and tears into it, and I just really, really hope that you enjoy it," Gee said of the game during a short speech given on the event's stage. I'd soon have the opportunity to learn more about her take on the game--and her experience voicing the main character--but first, Telltale and Deck Nine wanted to give preview attendees a better idea of what else is coming in the game's first season. After witnessing a currently-unreleased story trailer, we were shown a collection of behind-the-scenes clips about the making of the game itself.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/telltales-the-expanse-features-romance-options-and-severed-legs/1100-6514688/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>At the age of 80, Harrison Ford still wants to do some of his own stunts. He rejected the help of stunt performers for one particular scene in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.</p><p>The movie opens with Ford's Indiana Jones riding a horse through Manhattan. When he finished the scene, he was immediately approached by people who wanted to help him get down off the horse--but Ford thought he should do it himself to make it look more believable for a person of his age.</p><p>"I thought, 'What the f**k<em>?'</em> Like I was being attacked by gropers," <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a43965150/harrison-ford-indiana-jones-interview/">he told Esquire</a>.

## Reddit Is Cracking Down On Third-Party Apps With Steep Price Increases

<p dir="ltr">Reddit is one of the most popular social media sites out there, especially in the gaming community, but it seems that its management <em>really</em> wants you to use its official mobile app. Recently, the creator of the popular app Apollo <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/">revealed</a> that Reddit is increasing the price of the backend access that these third-party alternatives need to survive, and it could wipe them out.</p><p dir="ltr">As noted in that thread, Apollo's creator says that Reddit's proposed cost of $12,000 per 50 million API requests would essentially kill the app overnight. These requests are how the app obtains information from Reddit, and are thus necessary to its function.

<p>Tim Robinson's abstract sketch show I Think You Should Leave just premiered its third season and much like the previous two seasons, some of the quotes might be making their way into your everyday vernacular. However, superfans of the show have actually made the weird egg game from the second episode of the new season.</p><p>In the sketch, Robinson is playing a game where you feed a giant egg eggs from a basket on the other side of the screen. The amount of eggs changes and it gets more wild from there including the giant egg getting naked. </p><p>Matthew Barton posted that he and a friend recreated the game that's the focus of the sketch. The rules of the game are unclear and get weirder and weirder as the sketch progresses. You can play the game <a href="https://egggame.org/">here</a> and try your best.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fans-created-weird-egg-game-from-netflixs-i-think-you-should-leave-season-3/1100-6514729/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Modern fight sticks also look great and boast a degree of officially endorsed customization that can make them perform even better in the competitive scene.</p><p>We've had a look at what the market has to offer in this space, so if you're looking to add some retro flavor to your gaming setup, these fight sticks will have you ready to rumble in no time. With a number of arcade classics also available on various platforms these days, you can even extra use out of these fight sticks when you dip into your classic library of games.

<p>HBO's The Last of Us is one of the network's most popular shows in recent times, and it's coming back for a second season. But when? And what's on tap for the sophomore season? Star Bella Ramsey, who plays Ellie, recently discussed Season 2 in an <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2023/05/bella-ramsey-hit-parade">interview with Vanity Fair</a>, starting off by saying the next batch of episodes are "darker."</p><p>Season 2 is a "story about revenge" and the "dangers of unconditional love." Season 2 is expected to adapt the events of The Last of Us: Part II and introduce several new characters, including Abby and Dina. Anyone who has played the game or knows the story would understand why Season 2's story would be focused around revenge.</p><p>Ramsey also discussed the phenomenon of people calling The Last of Us actor Pedro Pascal an internet "daddy." Ramsey said, "I'm worried it's gone too far."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bella-ramsey-talks-the-last-of-us-season-2-says-its-darker/1100-6514718/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Redfall is one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/redfall-review-half-staked/1900-6418062/">biggest disappointments of 2023</a> so far, falling well short of the standards set by not only Xbox exclusives, but also developer Arkane's high reputation. According to a new <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-01/arcane-s-redfall-misfire-for-xbox-panned-after-7-5-billion-microsoft-deal">report from Bloomberg</a>, the project was beset with difficulties from the start, leading to roughly 70% of the company's staff that worked on Prey leaving by the end of development.</p><p dir="ltr">The report, which cites more than a dozen anonymous sources that worked on the game, states that the game's lack of success was not a surprise to many at the studio. The sources say that the project lacked clear direction from the start, with management offering conflicting visions for the game's overall goals--some felt that they were making Redfall's Far Cry, while others were told they were making something akin to Borderlands.</p><p dir="ltr">In general, the report shows that studio staff felt uneasy about working on Arkane's first multiplayer game, given that the developer was well-known for crafting high-quality immersive sims like the Dishonored series and Prey. The report estimates that roughly 70% of the staff who worked on Prey, the studio's last game, were no longer employed by Arkane Austin at the end of Redfall's development.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/redfalls-rocky-development-caused-arkane-to-lose-70-of-preys-dev-team-report/1100-6514721/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

As a Warhammer fan, I've been well catered to with Total War: Warhammer 1, 2, and 3, but for those virtual generals among us who prefer history books over Games Workshop's Black Library, the pickings have been much more slim and mostly in the form of Total War's Sagas. But from everything I've seen so far, my excitement for a new historical Total War has only been accelerated by my time with the Pharaohs.

<p dir="ltr">Gears 6 hasn't been officially announced by Microsoft, but the former head of The Coalition knows how he would have approached the game.

"So I did write the synopsis story for Gears 6. If I were to have stayed, here's the game we would have made--at least from a story perspective. Now they probably threw that out and said, 'Good luck and goodbye.' And that's fine. I definitely had where I would go with 6."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-6-outline-was-written-but-may-have-been-thrown-out-former-coalition-boss-says/1100-6514720/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

After a demo of some of the new elements coming to the campaign, as well as a few hours hands-on with battles, it feels as though with Total War: Pharaoh, Creative Assembly Sofia is aiming to bring the feature experimentation and development that has been traditionally delivered through its new historical titles, while also aiming to deliver a much deeper, more fleshed-out Total War experience.</p><p dir="ltr">The setting of the 1200 BCE New Kingdom period of ancient Egypt in the late Bronze Age was an interesting pick, as, broadly speaking, Total War is double dipping into this period of history, having previously explored the same century with Total War Saga: Troy. While some of that Troy DNA is visible and the time period feels a little like treading familiar ground, overall, Total War: Pharaoh looks like a different beast.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">Pharaoh aims to showcase the most extensive empire in Egyptian history, mixing the beauty of the setting with the brutality of the Bronze Age.

<p>Sonic the Hedgehog co-creator Yuji Naka has been formally sentenced to prison for insider trading, and is expected to serve two and a half years in jail. Additionally, Naka has received two fines, one of $17,800 and a supplementary penalty of $1.2 million. Naka's defense team is now aiming for his sentence to be suspended sentence and to have his fines lowered, as it claims that Naka "accidentally saw information that was extremely unrelated to [his] work," as reported by Japanese news site <a href="https://times.abema.tv/articles/-/10082179">Abema Times</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/yuji-naka-has-reportedly-been-sentenced-to-2-5-years-in-prison-for-insider-trading/">VGC</a>).</p><p>Final judgment for Naka is expected to arrive on July 7, and prosecutors claim that the Balan Wonderworld director has "showed no signs of remorse" <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-co-creator-yuji-naka-admits-guilt-in-square-enix-insider-trading-case/1100-6511976/">for the crimes that he admitted to being guilty of</a>.
