## Julian Sands: an hypnotically exotic actor full of style and extravagance

<p>After the smash hit of A Room With a View, Sands’ idiosyncrasies were hard to contain in mainstream movies, but in the right roles he was mesmerising</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/27/human-remains-found-in-california-mountains-confirmed-as-julian-sands">Sands dies aged 65</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2023/jun/27/julian-sands-a-life-in-pictures">A life in pictures</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/27/julian-sands-obituary">Obituary</a></li></ul><p>Julian Sands was the English screen actor who emerged in the 1980s in a generation of floppy-haired, high-cheekboned exquisites that included James Wilby, Rupert Everett, Hugh Grant, Rupert Graves, Daniel Day-Lewis and Colin Firth. But Sands turned out to be a rarer, stranger and more exotic flower than any of them, virtually impossible to cast as a conventional lead and almost as difficult as a character turn. And this was due to his extraordinarily (and to his fans, hypnotically) eccentric screen presence – distrait, elegant, deadly serious and otherworldly – and that utterly distinctive voice: softly melodious, slightly strangulated, nasal and decelerated; he delivered lines at about 60 to 70% of the speed at which other actors spoke. These were mannerisms that became more pronounced and sometimes baffling as he got older. And yet there was always a charisma in his oddity that gave him a long and busy screen career, particularly in horror and cult movies in which audiences loved him.</p><p>I will always remember his breakthrough appearance in the Merchant-Ivory movie A Room With a View, in which he played George Emerson, the innocently honest lover of art from a déclassé background whose unaffected passion captivates Helena Bonham Carter’s Lucy Honeychurch in Florence – and is in sharp distinction to her pretentious, unfeeling fiance Cecil Vyse, played by Daniel Day-Lewis. Sands’s George leaps impulsively into trees, declaiming “Beauty! Beauty!” and kisses Lucy in a poppy field with a mad audacity which is of a piece with his defiant, weirdly innocent admiration for her loveliness.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/27/julian-sands-an-hypnotically-exotic-actor-full-of-style-and-extravagance">Continue reading...</a>

The seeds of much subsequent trouble were sown. And we ended up with a national debt vastly greater in terms of money than was necessary and very ill distributed through the community.” That is where Britain finds itself heading. Keynes’s penetrating analysis is now ringing through Whitehall and beyond.</p><p>When Jeremy Hunt sits down with industry regulators on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/26/jeremy-hunt-ask-uk-regulators-investigate-firms-exploiting-price-rises-inflation" title="">Wednesday</a>, he will need more than soundbites to make companies stop fleecing their customers.

<p>Speak directly, be understanding and remember that sign language is rarely the answer for people with acquired hearing loss, writes <strong>Quentin Kopp</strong>. Plus a letter by <strong>Wendy Ritson</strong> </p><p>Regarding the documentary on Rose Ayling-Ellis (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/26/rose-ayling-ellis-signs-for-change-review-strictly-winner-documentary" title="">TV review, 26 June</a>), I am delighted that the issues facing deaf people are getting such eloquent advocacy. It is important to remember that while it is difficult to be born with little or no hearing, and therefore be dependent on sign language, the one in six people with hearing difficulties includes huge numbers of those who had normal hearing and learned their native language.</p><p>These people will have lost their hearing for a variety of medical reasons, industrial noise exposure or, in some cases, through exposure to high-volume music. Hearing aids only augment the retained hearing – they cannot restore lost hearing. The isolation and loss of confidence from hearing loss often causes devastating problems. The sufferers are assumed to be unintelligent and are often shouted at.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/27/steps-we-can-all-take-to-raise-deaf-awareness">Continue reading...</a>

I have spent the past few weeks chatting with creatives about their favourite projects – and the words that keep coming up are “unforgettable”, “bold”, “wild” and “profound”. Artangel’s achievements are inextricably linked with James Lingwood and Michael Morris, who in 1991 took over the charitable trust established by the art historian Roger Took in 1985. “It would never have happened without them,” artist Michael Craig-Martin says. “What they’ve invented is extraordinary – an entirely different realm of projects not found in galleries or museums.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/27/complex-unsettling-creepy-jarvis-cocker-colm-toibin-and-more-on-the-disturbing-genius-of-artangel">Continue reading...</a>

<p>At first it was uncomfortable and foreign, like asking for directions overseas. But now I feel at home when socialising sober</p><p>I was about 12 years old when I had my first drink. I was at a family reunion in the small country town where I grew up and an older cousin snuck a VB out of the esky and passed it around. I remember flinching at the awful taste but powering on for a few swigs anyway, wanting to be part of the gang.</p><p>In subsequent years, my drinking built up quite a bit of steam. It helped me feel less out of place in restrictive, rural social settings, where my emerging homosexuality was doing me no favours. Once I escaped to Melbourne, it eased interactions with peers as I began to explore the queer community. In private, it was a coping mechanism to drown out crowded thoughts, residual shame around my sexuality and anxiety about not fitting in.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/27/i-used-to-drink-as-an-escape-to-quit-i-thought-of-sobriety-as-an-adventure">Continue reading...</a>

There is not much hope for democracy in a country where the most effective challenge to a tyrant’s rule comes from a murderous bandit who demands more competent tyranny.</p><p>As for what happens next, there is not much point forecasting from abroad. I learned as a correspondent in Moscow that decrypting Russian power games is hard enough from inside the country.

<p>It was a dramatic 24 hours in Russia, when the leader of the Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, mutinied, turning his forces back toward Russia in what he described as a 'march for justice'. The organisation has been one of the most effective parts of Vladimir Putin's fighting machine in Ukraine, but a feud between Prigozhin and senior Russian generals had been simmering for months over the Kremlin’s leadership of the invasion and occupation of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a>. It was an airstrike by the Russian army that apparently provoked Prigozhin to launch a bold and audacious march on Moscow, which almost sparked a civil war, forcing Putin to fortify the capital and declare an emergency. After sweeping through much of Russia on the way to the capital, he eventually called it off when a deal was brokered by the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko<strong>. </strong>The rebellion marks the most direct threat to Putin’s grip on power since he first became president 23 years ago.</p><p></p><p>The Guardian's Russian affairs reporter, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/pjotr-sauer">Pjotr Sauer</a>, explains what Prigozhin's rebellion means for Russia and its embattled president</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2023/jun/27/will-the-wagner-mutiny-cost-putin-power-in-russia-video-explainer">Continue reading...</a>

## The Spin | County cricket’s relentless spin cycle has left England short of options

<p>There is no spin bowler in England’s team for the second Ashes Test and a look at the domestic game points to a wider problem</p><p>While Nathan Lyon prepares to play his 100th consecutive Test for Australia, England have opted to go to Lord’s without either of the two spinners grabbed in a hurried supermarket sweep after Jack Leach was ruled out of the series. Moeen Ali and Rehan Ahmed must watch from the sidelines when the second Ashes Test begins on Wednesday.</p><p>Magical as Moeen is, and exciting as Rehan will be, how did England get into a situation where Leach’s injury left them calling up a white-ball specialist without red-ball overs under his belt, who officially retired from Test cricket in 2021 and who had a sore spinning finger, and then, as cover for him, a young kid who has only played 10 Championship games? There should be a thick, nicely maturing layer of experienced county spinners, tap shoes laced in anticipation of the Ashes, waiting in line between Moeen, 36, and Ahmed, 18. Where have they gone?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/27/england-cricket-spinners-county-championship-options">Continue reading...</a>

## How The Bear became the feelgood show of the summer

<p>The second season of last summer’s breakout show keeps the heat but gets out of the kitchen, with entrancing results</p><p>A year ago, The Bear, an FX on Hulu series about a beleaguered Chicago sandwich shop with big-league aspirations, became <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jun/28/the-bear-review-fx-restaurant-drama">the breakout show of the summer</a> for primarily two reasons. One, it viscerally captured, better than any scripted show in recent memory, the cortisol and cacophony of a working kitchen; each episode barely left the backroom of The Original Beef of Chicagoland, a near-constant stream of oversubscribed orders, combustible egos and “yes chefs”. And two, it was palpably hot, not least because The Beef was almost always one mistake away from a grease fire.</p><p>There was the ever-present heat of a deadline, the scorching pressure to keep up and the volatile perfectionism of head chef Carmen “Carmy” Berzatto (Jeremy Allen White). White’s Carmy – tattooed, masochistic, grief-addled yet highly competent in a tight white T-shirt – became an overnight internet boyfriend, a dirtbag sex symbol whose lack of any apparent interest in sex only heightened his appeal. With eight half-hour episodes, no sexual or romantic storylines and an ensemble kitchen crew cast that grew better by the scene, The Bear was one of the very few shows that left me craving more.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/27/bear-season-2-hulu-fx-summer">Continue reading...</a>

The second was a goofy performance in the autofictional-autofactual grey area; Appignanesi’s cheerfully dishevelled figure was at the centre of almost every shot, sometimes leaving us to wonder if and where he had staged or reconstructed certain important moments – a heightened video-diarising or guided reality.</p><p>Now, he has taken what appears to be a quantum leap to a new level of seriousness. A professional setback just before lockdown (the sudden disappearance of funding for a projected feature) leaves him with time on his hands and Appignanesi takes an interest in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/extinction-rebellion">Extinction Rebellion</a>. He brings his camera to marches and meetings and is soon a deeply committed member, culminating in a triumphant speech at an XR protest outside 55 Tufton Street in central London, the notorious headquarters of climate-denying thinktanks, storming it in front of the crowd. Then his agent offers him a lucrative gig making a TV ad for Esso – and Appignanesi is tempted.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/27/my-extinction-review-climate-crisis-extinction-rebellion-xr">Continue reading...</a>

Peel 3 cloves of <strong>garlic</strong>, then slice them thinly and add them to pan.

<p>I want to see films that respond to our real-life experiences. But few film-makers are willing to tackle this shared trauma</p><p>In March 2022, I went with some friends to see The Worst Person in the World, Joachim Trier’s wistful film about a young woman’s flailing search for fulfilment. In the epilogue – set some time after the film’s events – the protagonist, Julie, is wearing a face mask, as are others onscreen.</p><p>Leaving the cinema, I struggled to articulate why I found this detail moving. The mask signalled that Julie was now on the other side of not just profound personal losses, but also the global shutdown that rattled us all. It anchored the film’s uncertain heroine in an uncertain present. As Paul Thomas Anderson <a href="https://moveablefest.com/joachim-trier-worst-person-in-the-world/">remarked</a>: “Something about it made me feel like I had seen something that had genuinely happened.” For those of us who turned 30 amid the agonies of lockdown, this little nod to the pandemic deepened the movie’s elegy to millennial youth.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/27/hollywood-disaster-covid-films-trauma">Continue reading...</a>

Bassist and founding member Steve Harris stalks the back of the stage with a satisfied smirk, egging on drummer Nicko McBrain’s relentless kick drum.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/27/iron-maiden-review-ovo-hydro-glasgow-future-past-tour">Continue reading...</a>

## Young V&A review: ‘The cobwebs have been truly blown away’

<p>After a three-year, £13m reimagining, the former Museum of Childhood has been reborn as a joyful and inspiring paradise of play</p><p>For a museum aimed at children, the V&amp;A’s Museum of Childhood has never felt very much like fun. Standing like an imposing Victorian workhouse in London’s Bethnal Green, its cavernous interior has always had the air of a mausoleum of toys, with stacks of dusty games sealed disappointingly behind glass. Rows of Victorian doll’s houses and their haunted inhabitants stared out from sombre ranks of vitrines, in a way that seemed more geared towards antique collectors than kids. As its name suggests, it was a place where childhood went to die, providing a trip down memory lane for parents and grandparents, while their own children longed to be taken to the soft play centre.<br /><br />All that has changed. After a three-year, £13m makeover, the cobwebs have been well and truly blown away, the gloomy building injected with dazzling new energy and a mischievous sense of fun – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jun/26/cultural-education-disparity-schools-v-and-a-tristram-hunt">now fittingly rebranded as Young V&amp;A</a>.<br /><br />“It’s about stimulating creativity, curiosity and ingenuity,” says Philippa Simpson, the V&amp;A’s director of design, estate and public programme. “We want to encourage the next generation of designers, makers and doers – not be a nostalgia fest for parents.”<br /><br />The project is the work of architects <a href="https://www.dematosryan.co.uk/archive/the-museum-of-childhood/">De Matos Ryan </a>(DMR), who were responsible for the main structural changes, and <a href="https://www.theaoc.co.uk/projects/v-a-museum-of-childhood/">AOC</a>, which handled the interiors and exhibition design. Both conducted intensive months-long residencies and co-design workshops in the museum to determine what local families and schools wanted the place to be, engaging a staggering 22,000 people. The overwhelming response? “More light, more colour, more pattern, more sound!” says AOC’s Gill Lambert. In short, the place needed more zing.</p><p>The youthful buzz begins on the outside, where a bold, storey-high V&amp;A logo now perches atop the stone entrance pavilion, trumpeting the museum’s presence at full volume in bright minty blue. Crucially, it’s visible when you come out of the tube station across the street, the sight-lines aided by the removal of a thick hedge and the arrival of a big steel arch, beckoning you in from the pavement.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/27/light-colour-newly-renovated-young-v-and-a">Continue reading...</a>

It was on that ride that the two undergraduates took capsules filled with MDMA powder for the very first time. Resnikoff, a biophysics major at Berkeley, had synthesized the drug himself. As the boat cut through the water of the San Francisco Bay, Gipson began to feel “a floating sense of euphoria … like some guy could come walking up to us asking for help and his guts are spilling out, and we’d be grooving on how beautiful it was.’”</p><p>According to Rachel Nuwer’s book I Feel Love: MDMA and the Quest for Connection in a Fractured World, Resnikoff and his girlfriend’s romp was the first-ever documented instance of people taking MDMA recreationally.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jun/27/i-feel-love-history-of-mdma-ecstacy-molly">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The east London haunt, its future uncertain even after a rare protection against noise complaints, is a microcosm of a live music industry under siege</p><p>It was a cause for celebration: “London’s historic George Tavern venue has been saved,” read an NME headline in February 2019. After years of campaigning, the Stepney Green pub and gig venue secured a rare protection against noise complaints. Kate Moss had been photographed wearing a “Save the George Tavern” T-shirt while Amy Winehouse (a regular), Ian McKellen, all four of the Rolling Stones and Justin Timberlake had offered public support. Pints flowed and locals crowdsurfed. Except the war, it seems, is never quite won – and the George has become a microcosm of the broader threats from developers to music venues in 2023.</p><p>The struggle dates back to 2002. The George Tavern was up for sale and artist Pauline Forster was the only bidder that wanted to preserve its history. Originally the Halfway House, a coaching inn in the 17th century, the derelict Grade II-listed building was being considered by developers to squeeze flats out of. Forster won by offering the agent cash, even though she didn’t have it, and three days later moved in with her five sons before finding a mortgage. She never intended on becoming a publican. “I didn’t even know how to pull a pint,” she says. “I bought it for its potential as a studio but the bar was just sitting there, ready to go.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/27/the-george-tavern-the-london-gig-venue-at-the-heart-of-the-fight-against-gentrification">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Two young women drift, drink and explore volatile emotions in Sian Astor-Lewis’s debut feature, with powerful performances by Lilit Lesser and Josefine Glæsel</p><p>There are quite a few feature films around about teenage or very young women falling in love or at least experiencing queer desire for the first time, more than there were though far fewer than ones about young men. Some have been excellent – see, for example <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jul/16/dee-rees-on-her-debut-film-pariah-my-favourite-scene-is-the-dildo-scene-honestly">Pariah</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/apr/13/culture.reviews">But I’m a Cheerleader</a>, or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/20/portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire-review-celine-sciamma">Portrait of a Lady on Fire</a>. But some of the less polished examples have a worthy earnestness baked in, as if they’re on a didactic mission and straining to offer positive role models. To Nowhere, on the other hand, feels deeply personal, bloody as a fresh wound, and entirely sugar-free.</p><p>Made with just enough budget to cover a couple of song clearances and a few fancy fetish-shop props, this debut feature from writer-director Sian Astor-Lewis follows female-identifying Tulip (Lilit Lesser) and her best friend Finn (Danish actor Josefine Glæsel) – who may or may not be trans – around a scruffy corner of south-west London over the course of a day. They wake up at Tulip’s flat, where she lives with her permanently angry, recently bereaved father (Michael Warburton) and shiftless uncle Stanley (Orlando Seale). Tulip starts the day with a row with her dad, while Finn urinates on Stanley’s toothbrush. Though it’s a Thursday in autumn or winter, they’re not at school or uni, and instead get going with booze stolen from Tulip’s dementia-addled grandmother (Jane Wood).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/27/to-nowhere-review-edgy-drama-of-queer-desire-is-as-raw-as-a-fresh-wound">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I don’t want to be churlish about Prince William’s new Homewards foundation. However …</p><p>Prince William is going to solve homelessness with a new royal foundation, launching a project called Homewards that starts with £3m for six towns and cities across the UK. It’s such a short sentence to make so little sense. You can look at the housing crisis from a range of perspectives. Some people are obsessed with planning permission; some have a supply-side fetish. You don’t have to chalk it all up to the ever more feudal rentier economy. Nevertheless, we could agree, I think, that dropping half a mil into a city, even if it might put a roof over a handful of heads, would barely scratch the surface.</p><p>Furthermore, whatever your view on equality – and again, there’s a spectrum, with some people thinking great concentrations of unearned wealth are good for motivation or whatnot – it would still, I think, strike you as piquant that a man with housing plenty beyond anything he could ever use would style himself as ambassador for the business of getting people off the streets.</p><p>Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/27/prince-william-homewards-homelessness-3m">Continue reading...</a>

On a good day, she would spend it all on a <em>vetkoek</em> – traditional doughnut-like fried bread stuffed, in her case, with chicken.</p><p>“For me, it just represents a really good Friday afternoon,” says the 28-year-old chef, chuckling.

<p>Before their 80s megastardom, the band minted a strange vision of European culture and tension that still resonates. They – and superfan James Dean Bradfield from the Manic Street Preachers – reflect on its power</p><p>During a break in rehearsals for Simple Minds’ 2020 arena tour, conversation turned to the fact that the guitarist Charlie Burchill had moonlighted on saxophone on the band’s early records. Their drummer, Cherisse Osei, was intrigued. With some reluctance – Burchill likens his youthful forays on the sax to “the cat getting strangled” – he played Osei Twist/Run/Repulsion. A sound collage lurking with menaces on the second side of their 1980 album, Empires and Dance, Burchill’s foghorn alarums vie with a sickly semitone bass shift, the singer Jim Kerr’s torrential abstractions, and a woman reciting a passage from a Nikolai Gogol short story in its French translation.</p><p>“Cherisse was like: ‘What’s<em> that?!</em>’” Burchill mimes a horrified facial expression. “Because it’s fucking bonkers.” Pondering whether Simple Minds would ever plan a themed album tour around Empires and Dance, the guitarist shakes his head. “I think it would be a bit obscure, that one.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/27/a-nuclear-reactor-of-music-the-story-of-simple-minds-classic-album-empires-and-dance">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Downton Abbey actor loves to keep a low profile. So how does she feel about portraying one of Hollywood’s most glamorous and headline-grabbing stars – and writing a book about her own mental health?</p><p>For many actors, the thought of playing Elizabeth Taylor at the National Theatre would be unnerving enough. But for Tuppence Middleton, who hadn’t done much stage work, it must have felt even more daunting. Not least because the job came up just three months after the birth of her child.

<p>Film follows Keiko, deaf since birth, making her way in the ring when Covid-19 lockdown arrives in Japan and she must deal with confidence issues</p><p>The title is presumably meant to refer to the film’s fine-boned heroine Keiko Ogawa (Yukino Kishii), a scrappy boxer who has just turned professional, but it just as aptly describes the film itself: a delicate, atmospheric study that’s quite unlike most other fight movies. Based on a memoir by boxer Keiko Ogasawara, this very internal story unfolds during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, with a locked-down Japan adding a further layer of isolation to Keiko’s life. Thanks to Kishii’s luminous performance, Keiko comes across as a very self-sufficient but lonely figure, completely deaf since birth, who finds in fighting some kind of release and sensory thrill, even though her lack of hearing creates very specific challenges in the ring given she can’t hear shouted instructions from her coaches or even the bell.</p><p>Keiko’s family – mum (Hiroko Nakajima) and brother Seiji (Himi Satô), with whom she communicates mostly via sign – are supportive but don’t really get the sport’s appeal, and that sort of goes for the co-workers at her day job as a hotel housekeeper. The only person who really gets her is the “chairman” (Tomokazu Miura) of the gym where she trains; he is a man now not in the best of health, considering closing up shop as his other regular trainees gradually jump ship, some grumbling that Keiko is the one who gets all the attention now.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/27/small-slow-but-steady-review-meditative-boxing-tale-as-deaf-fighter-rethinks-life">Continue reading...</a>

Tamsin Winter’s <strong><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/bad-influence-9781474979078">Bad Influence</a></strong> (Usborne) sees scholarly Amelia agree to something she immediately regrets in a bid to shake off her “loser” status. When a photo goes viral she’s labelled a bad influence, but is determined not to let one mistake define her. Winter has an enviable lightness of touch, tackling complex themes of popularity, self-esteem and social media with heart and humour in this important, empowering read.</p><p>From debut author Freja Nicole Woolf comes <strong><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/never-trust-a-gemini-9781529509991">Never Trust a Gemini</a></strong> (Walker), a feelgood LGBTQ+ romantic comedy with a fresh, joyful energy. Fourteen-year-old Cat is convinced that a match with her oblivious crush Alison is aligned in the stars, until she meets dangerously cool new girl Morgan. Woolf brilliantly captures the chaos of early teen life with relatable characters and a girl gang echoing that of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/13/louise-rennison-obituary">Louise Rennison’s Georgia Nicolson</a> series.</p><p>To order any of these books for a special price click on the titles or go to <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/">guardianbookshop.com</a>.

## Ukraine’s biggest enemy is the western belief that it cannot beat Putin. Now is the time to rethink that | Keir Giles

<p>Amid clears signs of the Russian leader’s vulnerability, we must think beyond helping Kyiv survive and aim for Zelenskiy to actually win</p><p>The myth of Vladimir Putin’s unchallengeable power has been fatally undermined by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/25/antony-blinken-russia-ukraine-wagner-group">the challenge from Yevgeny Prigozhin</a> and his Wagner army. By surviving – for now – Prigozhin has set a dangerous precedent for others in Russia who may wish to test their strength against the Kremlin.</p><p>But the weekend’s events also showed a complete failure by Russia’s military, security and intelligence agencies – in fact, by the state as a whole – to deal with the obvious challenge of an armed group apparently heading for Moscow. The evident confusion in Moscow and inability to respond to Prigozhin’s challenge also proves Russia is not invincible in its conflict with Ukraine. That critical weakness can only be encouraging for Ukraine in its efforts to beat back the Russian invaders. Russia, it seems, may be strong on the frontline, but it is systemically fragile and the Kremlin can be frightened into paralysis.</p><p>Keir Giles works with the Russia and Eurasia programme of Chatham House and is the author of Russia’s War on Everybody</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/27/ukraine-west-vladimir-putin-russia-kyiv-volodymyr-zelenskiy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The treasures of Berlin, Monaco and the Amalfi coast can be savoured on a budget if you use these local and regional buses</p><p>With sterling in its customary parlous state, anything that makes your European holiday money go further is going to be welcome. And one simple but rewarding method is to make friends with the humble local bus. Yes, it’s true that most endure a humdrum existence ferrying commuters and shoppers about, but if you ferret around you’ll discover that many others pass through scenery worthy of a glitzy sightseeing tour. But they do so for a fraction of the cost. And furthermore, they often afford the traveller an authentic slice of local life into the bargain.<br /><br />Here, then, are six fantastically scenic European bus routes – all of them so inexpensive you’ll want to give the driver a tip.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/jun/27/6-of-the-most-scenic-and-affordable-bus-trips-in-europe">Continue reading...</a>

Who knows how much of it was inspired by actual events – but even if just a little bit of it is true, these women are clearly having way more fun than the rest of us.</p><p>Not that their lives don’t have ups and downs, especially Zaida herself. Back in Barcelona to flatsit the well-appointed home of one stable, early-to-bed couple who are off on holiday with their kids for three weeks, Zaida arrives in town freighting a broken heart, having been dumped and ghosted by (now) ex-girlfriend Gabriella (Bea Escribano).

## One Boy, Two Bills and a Fry-Up review – Wes Streeting’s memoir of hardship… and determination

<p>The shadow health secretary’s way with a cliche doesn’t much hinder his compelling story of overcoming adversity – and bankrobbing relatives</p><p>Wes Streeting’s memoir, the cumbersomely titled <em>One Boy, Two Bills and a Fry Up</em><em>,</em> pulls off the very rare trick of being both a little bit boring and unexpectedly fascinating. On the one hand, the Labour MP for Ilford North is refusing to fight as a combatant in the late <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/apr/14/fiction.martinamis">Martin Amis’s war against cliche</a>; in this book, cheeks tend to be rosy red, and working-class matriarchs are always “strong”. You know he must have written it in a great rush, against a harried background of TV appearances, leaflet drops and hospital visits (Streeting is shadow health secretary), and the gallop to the finish shows on the page, particularly when he pads things out with politics. No one wants to read this much about the road to NUS president, not even Wes’s mum.</p><p>But on the other hand, it’s also transfixing, albeit in a way I struggle fully to explain. Streeting’s rise from poverty in the East End of London to the Palace of Westminster via Cambridge University is amazingly inspiriting – even now, he’s only 40 – and there’s something so unaffected about the way he describes it, details chosen for no more writerly reason than because he remembers them: the Wall’s coleslaw and He-Man jellies he enjoyed as a treat as a boy; the skate he favoured whenever his grandfather took him down the chippy. He has no discernible self-pity and seems never to judge anyone, not even those who (the reader may think) at times let him down very badly.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/27/one-boy-two-bills-and-a-fry-up-review-wes-streeting-shadow-health-secretary-memoir">Continue reading...</a>

## The truth about inflammation: all you need to know about 2023’s hottest health topic, from causes to cures

<p>Inflammation is the scourge of modern life, judging by all the supplements, workouts and diets that promise to fight it. But what precisely gets inflamed, and why – and is it always a bad thing?</p><p>To understand what can go wrong with our bodies, it helps to remember that they haven’t evolved much since we were hunting and gathering a few thousand years ago. Our greedy response to sugar, for instance, worked well when we could only get it from wild berries; now that it’s combined with salt and fat into foods we can’t stop eating, it can be a problem. Or consider our stress response: if the only time your body reroutes resources from the immune system to your fight-or-flight system is during the occasional sabre-toothed tiger attack, that’s fine. If every mean tweet, upsetting headline or twinge of worry about the mortgage sends your systems into panic mode, your body never gets a chance to recuperate.</p><p>Inflammation, one of the least understood and most debated topics in health, works a bit like this. There are hundreds of cookbooks that promise to deliver an “anti-inflammatory diet”, with supplements, gels, teas, workouts, saunas and cryotherapy chambers offering the possibility of even more dramatic results. But inflammation, at its core, is a vital part of the body’s immune response – not something to try to eliminate. It is a complex biological process that occurs when the body detects harmful stimuli and its purpose is to protect you and kickstart healing. Sometimes this process gets out of control, leading to chronic inflammation that damages rather than heals. The tricky part? Our understanding of this process is evolving: there is a chance that, if you tweak your knee on a five-a-side pitch, you will still be given medical advice that was flipped on its head a decade ago.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/27/the-truth-about-inflammation-all-you-need-to-know-about-2023s-hottest-health-topic-from-causes-to-cures">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It has been said that condoms share marketing characteristics with napalm and funerals. But it is Ben Wilson’s mission to make us believe they are key to human happiness</p><p>It is important to Ben Wilson, the man in charge of the condom brand Durex, that he chews the condoms he sells. He likes to consider their flavour, to know the sensory experience of a customer engaged in oral sex, and to think about how it could be bettered. He makes other people sample them, too. In a car on the way to the Durex condom factory on the outskirts of Bangkok, as traffic vibrated in the heat along the highway, he told me with pride about the time he had laid out rows of bananas and condoms for a gathering of senior executives at Reckitt, Durex’s parent company. “I said: ‘If you want to work on condoms you need to put a condom on that banana and <em>taste</em> it.’”</p><p>Freshly promoted, Wilson is Reckitt’s global category director for intimate wellness, overseeing all the company’s sex-related products, including Durex condoms, lubes and toys. Sandy-haired, rosy-cheeked, nearing 50, Wilson has a kind of renegade energy, consciously uncorporate. He spikes his hair, never wears a suit and zones out to DJs Paul van Dyk and David Guetta while travelling. To prepare for his fortnightly DJ lessons, he is at his decks for up to 12 hours a week in a specially designated room in his house on the south coast of England, where he lives with his wife and two children. (Wilson’s retirement plan is fully formed: a second home in Ibiza, already bought. He would die happy, he told me, if he could play a set at the EDM festival Tomorrowland.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/27/man-who-wants-to-make-condoms-sexy-durex">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When Russia’s mercenary group marched on Moscow, it seemed to take the world – and Vladimir Putin – by surprise . What does it mean for his grip on power – and for his war?</p><p>It was a sudden, surprising and chaotic rebellion that few seemed to have expected. On Friday night, the leader of Russia’s armed mercenaries, the Wagner group, suggested his soldiers fighting in Ukraine had been attacked by their own side – the Russian military. By Saturday morning, the group had taken over a town in Russia. From there, the group’s leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, issued more threats and soon they were marching on Moscow, killing Russian soldiers on the way.</p><p>In response, Vladimir Putin issued furious statements heavy with threats. But then, just as soon as the mutiny started, it was over. The Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, announced he had brokered a deal between the two sides and that Prigozhin had agreed to go into exile in Belarus. No action would be taken against Wagner fighters.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/jun/27/what-the-wagner-mutiny-means-for-ukraine-russia-and-putin-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
