<p>At long last, parents and guardians can now get better insight into their teens&rsquo; social media&mdash;at least for Messenger and Instagram. Starting Tuesday, Meta is launching a set of Parental Supervision tools to better aid with controlling usage of both apps.</p>



<p>In Meta&rsquo;s post announcing the new features, the company outlined several ways for parents to track and understand their kids&rsquo; habits on Messenger. For starters, you&rsquo;ll now be able to see how much time a teen spends on Messenger. You can also see their contact list, privacy and safety settings, who can view their Messenger stories, and who can message them (i.e., friends, friends of friends, or nobody) as well as get notifications when changes to those settings occur. If a teen allows, you&rsquo;ll get alerts if they report someone, too. Parents will remain unable to read their teen&rsquo;s messages.</p>



<p>These tools are available now in the US, UK, and Canada, with Meta saying worldwide expansion will happen &ldquo;in the coming months.&rdquo; Further time and interaction Parental Supervision management tools should arrive over the next year, and will work in both unencrypted and end-to-end encrypted messages.</p>



<p>Instagram is also getting more parental control tools. Guardians will now be able to see the accounts their teen follows and is followed by, as well as how many friends they have in common with them. Behind the scenes, Meta is adding additional barriers to keep sketchy adults from contacting minors. An invite to connect must first be sent before a private message (much less photos, videos, or calls) can be sent&mdash;and only one invitation can be sent. This move builds on top of Instagram&rsquo;s previous restrictions, which prevented people over 19 from messaging younger teens who don&rsquo;t follow them.</p>



<p>These safety features for Messenger and Instagram are joined by a set aimed at boosting mental health. Facebook is getting Instagram&rsquo;s <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://help.instagram.com/750317295927782/?cms_platform=android-app&amp;helpref=platform_switcher&amp;xcust=2-1-1970249-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Take A Break</a> feature, which encourages users to stop using the app and establish daily limits. For its part, Instagram will begin suggesting that teens close the app if scrolling through Reels at night. (In fairness, there are a lot of adults who could use that latter feature, too.)

## Microsoft Teams now has a ******* profanity filter

<p>Dropping an F-bomb into a conversation with your friends over Friday night drinks is probably perfectly acceptable. But in a conversation about a client over Teams? Probably not. A new profanity filter within Microsoft Teams will edit out the offending words&mdash;from the transcript, at least.</p>



<p>Microsoft <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/introducing-profanity-filtering-control-and-customization-for/ba-p/3856784&amp;xcust=2-1-1970229-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">said this week that the Teams profanity filter</a>, which has been in development for some time, has finally arrived. You&rsquo;ll be able to adjust the profanity filter within the Teams transcription options within your user settings, toggling it on and off as needed. Both features are now available on the desktop and web clients for commercial customers, Microsoft says.</p>



<p>Note that the profanity toggle is user-configurable, and not subject to the whims of the meeting organizer (who might have a tendency to swear) or even your company&rsquo;s IT administrator. Filtering is entirely up to you, and your preference (on or off) will be kept private. You&rsquo;ll simply see an obscenity filtered out in your transcript of the meeting if you toggle this option on, while your more freewheeling coworker will not.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Teams profanity settings" class="wp-image-1970236" height="697" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-27-115900.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>You&rsquo;ll find the new profanity settings as part of the Microsoft Teams user options.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>You can imagine, of course, potential issues. &ldquo;Bloody&rdquo; is simply an anachronism in American English, but in the U.K., it has been considered a mild curse word. Is &ldquo;crap&rdquo; considered profane? &ldquo;Damn,&rdquo; or &ldquo;hell?&rdquo; In most circles, probably not. But certain terms used freely among Australian friends wouldn&rsquo;t fly in American circles, and Microsoft makes no distinction between the various English dialects, at least at the present. There also doesn&rsquo;t appear to be a &ldquo;dictionary&rdquo; of terms that you can toggle on or off.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, in a world where Teams now offers <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1501191/microsoft-includes-ai-powers-in-the-new-teams-premium.html">&ldquo;intelligent recap&rdquo; of meetings using Teams Premium</a>, more and more meetings may be viewed asynchronously, or offline. (As part of this update, you&rsquo;ll also have the option of adjusting the length and placement of the transcribed captions, Microsoft says.) Skimming a transcript and the associated presentation may become more common. All this feature will do is help prevent a participant (or even a potential client) from becoming turned off at your vice president&rsquo;s potty mouth.</p>

## Windows Hello gets new built-in passkey powers

<p>There&rsquo;s a multi-pronged effort to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/698137/apple-google-microsoft-commit-to-killing-passwords-entirely.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">get rid of passwords</a> going on and Microsoft is part of it, even if they&rsquo;re not exactly at the front. The company&rsquo;s latest additions to Windows 11 in the Insider Preview Build reflect that, integrating modern passkeys (biometrics, PINs, device-based access like smartphones) into the Windows Hello system. The new interface even includes passkey management. </p>



<p>According to the latest post on the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/06/22/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-23486/&amp;xcust=2-1-1969610-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Insider Blog</a> (spotted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-11-is-getting-a-built-in-passkey-manager-for-windows-hello/&amp;xcust=2-1-1969610-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bleeping Computer</a>), the new system allows users to create passkeys for supported websites and access them via Windows Hello, which can then be used to activate them via PIN, face scanning, or fingerprint scanning (with supported hardware, of course). You&rsquo;ll also be able to access a list of saved passkeys via the Accounts page in Settings and manually delete any new ones. </p>



<p>This requires not only the latest Insider build, 23486, but support from both the browser (Edge or Chrome Canary) and the website you&rsquo;re trying to access. So, in terms of the number of users who can actually access the tool for the services they want, it&rsquo;s a pretty tiny slice. But every little bit helps. That still puts Windows <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1806627/rip-passwords-google-accounts-now-support-passkeys.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">well behind ChromeOS</a> in terms of passkey support and we&rsquo;re months away from these changes making it to the general Windows 11 build. </p>



<p>Other additions in build 23486 include more effects in the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1928248/dynamic-lighting-will-be-windows-tool-to-manage-your-pcs-bling.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">new Dynamic Lighting tool</a>, a new Dev Home app that integrates with Github for developers and various other tweaks and fixes. Oh and remember that bit about removing a bunch of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1962876/windows-may-soon-have-fewer-folder-options-in-file-explorer.html">infrequently-used view options in File Explorer</a>? That&rsquo;s out the window after some no doubt pointed user feedback.  </p>

## Microsoft is working on a full cloud-based Windows OS
 - [https://www.pcworld.com/article/1969519/microsoft-is-working-on-a-cloud-based-windows-os.html](https://www.pcworld.com/article/1969519/microsoft-is-working-on-a-cloud-based-windows-os.html)

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>&ldquo;The cloud&rdquo; was a big tech buzzword about a decade ago. Everything would be accessible everywhere. And that more or less happened &mdash; with a little prep work and a decent connection, you can access pretty much anything from anywhere, from your resume .doc file to a collection of movies to full streaming PC games. But, according to recently revealed information, Microsoft is looking into streaming all of Windows to client PCs from cloud-based servers. </p>



<p>Said info was revealed as part of the ongoing Federal Trade Commission hearing into Microsoft&rsquo;s attempted acquisition of Activision-Blizzard, which has already been a treasure trove of behind-the-curtain corporate info. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/27/23775117/microsoft-windows-11-cloud-consumer-strategy&amp;xcust=2-1-1969519-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">As The Verge reports</a>, one long-term goal of the company (at least according to internal documentation dated 2022) was to &ldquo;Move Windows 11 increasingly to the Cloud.&rdquo; This would, according to the document, mean &ldquo;a full Windows operating system streamed from the cloud to any device.&rdquo; </p>



<p>The idea isn&rsquo;t a new one. Mainframe-client systems are practically ancient history in computing terms and it&rsquo;s certainly possible to do with something as robust as Windows, but that requires a fairly antiquated local network. More modern implementations include running virtual machines on powerful servers (yes, including Windows) and allowing remote workers to log into them. Companies like VMWare and V2 Cloud already offer these on a corporate level and there are even <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/398872/no-pc-no-problem-shadow-supercharges-cloud-gaming-with-lower-prices-faster-hardware-and-vr.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">services like Shadow</a> that offer a full remote Windows machine directly to consumers. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Shadow running on a Macbook" class="wp-image-1969572" height="576" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/348685-shadow-on-macbook-658419-original-1583346435-100835226-large.webp" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Shadow</p></div>



<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394962/windows-365-five-key-differences-from-windows-home-and-pro.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Windows 365</a>, launched two years ago (before this internal document), is a sort of baby step towards this reality. (It&rsquo;s where the header image for this article comes from.) For one, it&rsquo;s only available to corporate customers, so it isn&rsquo;t really relevant to the kind of everyday users Microsoft needs in order to make a major market shift. Two, it&rsquo;s part of the Azure platform, which means management is centralized with an IT department in mind. It&rsquo;s also missing a lot of consumer-focused features like media tools or the more hand-holding type of support that entry-level users rely on. </p>



<p>But the idea of Windows as a full cloud system is in line with Microsoft&rsquo;s broader market pushes in the last few years. After all, you can&rsquo;t get much more &ldquo;software as a service&rdquo; than a full operating system you pay for monthly, streamed to &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; screens that need incredibly inexpensive hardware. (Or, for that matter, the phones, tablets, and TVs that users have already purchased.) Microsoft certainly has the infrastructure to pull this off, as evidenced by <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/810011/xbox-cloud-gaming-review.html">Xbox Game Pass&rsquo;s cloud gaming push</a>, though that&rsquo;s only part of getting the experience smooth enough to sell it to regular consumers. </p>



<p>There&rsquo;s also an element to this plan that&rsquo;s far beyond Microsoft&rsquo;s control. While a corporate customer moving to the cloud can be relied upon to supply a high-quality connection, that&rsquo;s by no means guaranteed for consumers, even in ostensibly wealthy nations like the United States. The idea of losing your computer&rsquo;s full capability the moment you move away from a robust broadband connection will be a hard sell. </p>



<p>Whether Microsoft is still interested in this cloud-based push a year later, as it tries to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1930286/heres-what-windows-copilot-can-do-according-to-microsoft.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">shove &ldquo;AI&rdquo; into every press release</a>, isn&rsquo;t known. But it seems like a safe bet that the company is still working on this idea. </p>

## Zelda’s Koroks need smaller backpacks. Period.

<p>If you&rsquo;re a gamer, you&rsquo;re probably aware of the recently released <em>Legend of Zelda: Tears of Kingdom</em>, the sequel to <em>Breath of the Wild</em>. I&rsquo;ve been playing it for hours and I&rsquo;ve barely made a dent. The size of this world is just too massive to comprehend. While I love the grandiose landscapes and colorful characters (Beedle for the win!), I&rsquo;ve got one thorn in my side: the dang Koroks! These plant-like spirits can be found throughout the land of Hyrule.</p>



<p>Look, I love these cheerful creatures as much as the next person, but&nbsp;the ones carrying the oversized backpacks can buzz right off. Not only is it time consuming to transport them to the right spot, as you&rsquo;re forced to use the building mechanic (I&rsquo;m not a fan), but it totally derails me from whatever quest I&rsquo;m working on at the time. As a kind of consolation prize for finishing the Korok&rsquo;s puzzle, you&rsquo;ll be awarded a seed, which you can exchange for more inventory slots. Is the payoff worth it? Not really. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Looking for more hot-takes on video games? If so, check out this <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1502186/blizzard-promises-to-make-overwatch-2-better-but-im-suspicious.html">PCWorld writer&rsquo;s maddening experience playing <em>Overwatch 2</em></a>.</p></blockquote>



<h2 id="its-weirdly-time-consuming">It&rsquo;s weirdly time consuming</h2>



<p>Nintendo decided to take a cue from <em>Minecraft </em>and introduce a new building mechanic in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>. This mechanic allows you to grab various objects and stick them together with a material akin to chewing gum. The build mechanic is wonky, that&rsquo;s for sure. Sometimes certain objects don&rsquo;t attach exactly the way you want them to, which can be really frustrating. It takes more time than it should to build a wind-powered raft, and so on. Hilariously enough, the Koroks, specifically the ones wearing backpacks, can stick to objects as well.</p>



<p>Nothing quite kills the excitement of exploring a new area than trying to build a transport vehicle for a Korok that&rsquo;s burdened by a ridiculously large backpack. It definitely takes me out of the moment, which is a big downfall, as this is the type of game where being present is everything. I want nothing more than to explore the vast lands of Hyrule, taking in the blue rivers of Zora&rsquo;s Domain or the taupe-colored sands of the Gerudo desert uninterrupted. So, it&rsquo;s a chore to figure out how to get the backpack Koroks from point A to point B, especially with the building mechanic being as unreliable as it is. To see the aggravation in full effect, check out the video below. </p>

</div></figure>



<h2 id="other-korok-puzzles-are-far-more-enjoyable">Other Korok puzzles are far more enjoyable</h2>



<p>Koroks exist in nearly every nook and cranny of this game. Unlike the ones wearing backpacks, the other Koroks remain invisible until you solve their puzzles. Sometimes it involves putting a rock in the right place or chasing a floating flower. You don&rsquo;t have to build some elaborate vehicle and send them hurtling off in some random direction so they can meet up with their friend. The other puzzles are more straightforward and enjoyable, so I don&rsquo;t mind them as much. </p>



<p>But you haven&rsquo;t known true disappointment until you&rsquo;ve built a rocket-powered vehicle for an over-encumbered Korok in need, and all you get is one lousy seed for your efforts. What a bummer. Although you can trade in these seeds for more inventory slots, I don&rsquo;t find the payoff worth it, not when it comes to rescuing the ones with the backpacks. Plus, the more inventory slots you buy, the more seeds you&rsquo;ll need. I&rsquo;d rather solve the other Korok puzzles that don&rsquo;t take that much time or effort. </p>

<p>Mechanical keyboards have been around almost as long as personal computers, and the basic switch technology we&rsquo;re still using first popped up in the 1980s. But it&rsquo;s not an exaggeration to say that mechanical boards have never been as popular, or as stunningly variable, as they are right now. If you&rsquo;re just getting into the craze, you might feel paralyzed by the number of options available.</p>



<p>Allow us to remove some of the questioning and doubt. Below are the best mechanical keyboards we&rsquo;ve reviewed, in a variety of categories&mdash;best overall, on a budget, for gaming, wireless, et cetera. Though they excel in different areas, each mechanical keyboard pick is absolutely the best in its class, and well worth both your attention and your hard-earned dough.  </p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve singled out the Q1 Pro for its wireless prowess, but really, it&rsquo;s hard to go wrong with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/823922/keychron-q5-mechanical-keyboard-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">any of the Q series</a>. Fantastic build quality, near-endless customization, and a surprisingly fair price (at least compared to keyboards with similar features) make it the brand to beat if you want a high-end mechanical board. Q boards come in a variety of sizes and layouts, from tiny 40% all the way to a massive 108-key layout. And all of them include awesome aluminum frames, RGB lighting, hot-swap switches, internal sound damping, and easy programming with QMK or VIA. </p>

<p>This unassuming little board is packing a shocking amount of high-quality hardware, like exotic BOX switches, PBT keycaps, a brass switch plate, tons of internal foam, and hot-swap switch sockets. It&rsquo;s easily the best typing experience out of the box of any keyboard on this list, but you can customize it even further if you want, and it also comes with both Bluetooth and 2.4GHz support, which makes this our pick for the best wireless mechanical board. The plastic case and odd non-standard programming software aren&rsquo;t great, but it&rsquo;s also significantly cheaper than similarly equipped boards, so the bargain helps even things out. </p>

<p>Keychron&rsquo;s K Pro series has most of the features of the Q Pro keyboards, but with a fraction of the size and weight. The K3 Pro is an ideal combination of compact layout and comfort, requiring no extra programming or muscle memory for most users. Despite fewer options for switches and keycaps at this size, the K6 Pro also offers at least some customization choices: Its RGB lighting and programming can be tweaked in VIA software, and its switches are hot-swappable. The same features are available in 65%, tenkeyless, and full-sized layouts, but we like this one for its excellent travel capabilities. </p>

<p>Gamers who want bombastic excess in their keyboards need look no further than Razer. The latest version of the BlackWidow ditches wireless to double down on super-fast, 8,000Hz polling (which means the keyboard is faster than your puny human reflexes) and enough RGB lighting to double as emergency illumination for the average jumbo jet. It&rsquo;s also absolutely massive in terms of keys, with an extra eight macro keys and two, count &rsquo;em, <em>two</em>, programmable radial dials. Just make sure you have enough space on your desk for both the keyboard and the included light-up wrist rest. </p>

<p>This little board crams so many features into such a small price, it&rsquo;s our pick for the best budget mechanical keyboard <em>and </em>the best budget gaming board. We&rsquo;re talking PBT keycaps, high-quality Kailh switches in hot-swap sockets, RGB lighting, a radial dial, and internal foam for sound damping. All that for under 50 bucks is absolutely nuts in terms of value, and it&rsquo;s a great place to start if you&rsquo;re not sure you want to invest a lot into a fancier board. The only thing the KM250 is missing is a programming tool, but at this price, it&rsquo;s more than fair as a trade-off. </p>

<p>Keychron&rsquo;s on this list again thanks to the company&rsquo;s dedication to offering as many form factors as possible. The Q11 offers the same features as the rest of the Q series (fantastic aluminum body, hot-swap sockets, PBT keycaps, VIA programming), plus a split layout that&rsquo;s essential for users who need ergonomic customization. It&rsquo;s also a fraction of the price of other high-end ergonomic mechanical boards, with the only real downside being that it doesn&rsquo;t offer a tenting kit. </p>

<p>Arguably the most famous keyboard among mechanical enthusiasts is the IBM Model M, thanks to its unique and incredibly tactile (and noisy!) buckling spring switch mechanism. Some of these keyboards have been in continual use for more than 40 years, but if you&rsquo;re looking for something a little more accessible, Model F Labs is making reproductions with exactly the same tank-like build and modern USB connections. the typing experience is like no other, just don&rsquo;t be surprised if it&rsquo;s a little harder than you&rsquo;re used to&mdash;on both your fingers and your wallet. </p>

<h2 id="what-to-consider-when-shopping-for-a-mechanical-keyboard">What to consider when shopping for a mechanical keyboard</h2>



<p>If you&rsquo;re just getting into mechanical keyboards, then you&rsquo;re probably most interested in how it &ldquo;feels&rdquo; to use one. In short, mechanical switches offer a deeper and more satisfying press on each key, which is preferred over standard inexpensive keyboards by heavy-duty typists and gamers. (Not all of them, of course, but most people seem to favor at least a certain level of clickiness.) But there are a lot of different variables that can affect how those keys feel. </p>



<h3 id="key-switches">Key switches</h3>



<p>Modern mechanical keyboards come in a staggering array of switch varieties, from smooth and linear to loud and clickly, with tons of options for mechanisms and spring strength. The only real way to know which one you prefer is to try &rsquo;em out (retail store displays are great for this). That being said, more expensive keyboards tend to come with nicer, high-quality switches from name brands like Cherry and Gateron. For the ultimate in customization, track down a keyboard with hot-swap switches, which let you swap out the switches for new and different ones whenever you want. </p>



<h3 id="keycaps">Keycaps</h3>



<p>Keycaps are the little pieces of plastic that sit on top of the switches&mdash;what your fingers press down on. Switching out the keycaps for a set of nicer ones, maybe made of better PBT plastic or themed after your favorite TV show, is a popular and easy keyboard mod. Some keyboard makers even sell their own upgrade sets. Keycaps with a Cherry MX-compatible stem will work with almost all modern mechanical switches, just make sure you find a set that matches the layout of your keyboard. </p>



<h3 id="layout">Layout </h3>



<p>The layout of the keys on your keyboard varies more than you might think. Full-sized keyboards include a 10-key area to the right of the arrow cluster, but gaming models often omit this in order to make more room for mouse movements, calling this the &ldquo;10-key-less&rdquo; layout. Some keyboards go even smaller, with 60% being the smallest that mainstream brands use, chopping off the Function row, 10-key area, and even the arrow keys (which have to be accessed via a Fn button). A few designs go even larger than the full layout, with an extra column or two of programmable keys for custom bindings or macros. Which one you want comes down to use-case, available space, and, perhaps more pertinently, taste. <br /><br />These general layouts shouldn&rsquo;t be confused with country- and region-specific key layouts, like ANSI and ISO. Most popular designs are available in at least those two variants. </p>



<h3 id="wireless-options">Wireless options</h3>



<p>Mechanical keyboards start with a standard wired USB connection, which may or may not be detachable from the keyboard itself for easier cable routing. Wireless boards tend to default to Bluetooth these days, since pretty much all PCs and mobile devices can use it. More premium models offer both Bluetooth and the faster, more reliable USB wireless dongle, typically on a 2.4GHz connection. Gamers definitely want to stick to wired or dongle options as Bluetooth&rsquo;s susceptibility to input lag and interference can hinder gaming. </p>



<h3 id="lighting">Lighting </h3>



<p>Even budget gaming keyboards come with LED backlights these days, though they might not be the fully programable, device-synced lightshow that companies like Razer and Corsair delight in. Unless you&rsquo;re constantly playing in the dark and you can&rsquo;t touch-type, it&rsquo;s entirely cosmetic. It&rsquo;s fun, that&rsquo;s about it. </p>



<h3 id="extras">Extras </h3>



<p>Keyboard makers are forever trying to one-up each other with extra features. For a mechanical board you can generally expect a removable USB cable (maybe a braided one for nicer boards), and possibly an included keycap puller and wrist rest. Larger boards usually include dedicated media controls, and the nicer ones get a fully programmable wheel or knob, as well as hot-swap switch sockets that let you experiment with different types of key switches. An especially nice option is on-device memory, allowing you to keep key layout programs without running a driver program on each new computer. </p>

<p>Setting up a router can go fast&mdash;so fast that you might skip a few steps or think to save them for later. Except later might come too late, as I recently discovered after an unexpected (and much unwanted) reset of my router. Device configuration and settings all gone in a second&hellip;and with no recoverable backup on hand.</p>



<p>I don&rsquo;t have a right to complain, since I know better. (Originally the router setup was meant to be &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; at the start of the pandemic, but then, well&hellip;) Instead, let me serve as a lesson that you can easily improve on, especially since other things can go badly with your home network if you don&rsquo;t set it up right. Take an extra 15 minutes and follow the following four steps&mdash;and don&rsquo;t put some of them off, like I did.</p>

<h2 id="back-up-your-settings">Back up your settings</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Router settings in browser BT Smart Hub" class="wp-image-1075049" height="850" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/How-do-I-log-into-my-router-browser.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>If you don&rsquo;t see an immediate option for backing up your router settings, look for it under advanced settings or device info.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jim Martin / Foundry</p></div>



<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the step I skipped and ultimately regretted.</p>



<p>Few people use strictly default settings on their router (and honestly, for better security, you shouldn&rsquo;t leave them as they are out of the box). Most folks at least change things like the name of their Wi-Fi network and its password. You may also have a guest network and parental controls in place, and possibly more granular tweaks like quality of service (QoS) settings.</p>



<p>Backing up your settings periodically is ideal&mdash;every time you make a new adjustment, it&rsquo;s a good idea to create a new backup. You should be able to find the backup option pretty easily within your router settings, but if not, your router&rsquo;s manual should explain how to do so. It will save you time if you ever have to reset your router (or, in my case, you effectively reset the router through sheer dumb behavior). After the reset, you can load the file with your saved configuration and be back to status quo (or dang close to it) within just a few minutes.</p>



<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t backup every time you make a change, do so after you first get your router up and running. You&rsquo;ll have a baseline to work with should disaster strike.</p>



<h2 id="keep-your-firmware-updated">Keep your firmware updated</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img alt="Netgear Orbi router firmware update in mobile app" class="wp-image-1965476" height="516" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/orbi-firmware.png?w=1200" width="918" /><figcaption>This screenshot from Netgear&rsquo;s YouTube channel shows how to check for firmware updates in the mobile app for its Orbi router.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Netgear / YouTube</p></div>



<p>You&rsquo;ll often get urged by tech journalists like me to keep your firmware updated for security reasons&mdash;and that <em>is</em> true. Vulnerabilities can allow bad actors to gain access to your router and then spy on your network traffic, use your router to attack other devices on the wider internet, or just simply disable it.</p>



<p>There&rsquo;s another other main reason to stay up to date, though. Firmware updates often include fixes for bugs that can affect your router&rsquo;s functionality. In my case, my accidental router wipe happened due to older firmware causing periodic issues with logging into the device. I thought a reboot could help the problem. I accidentally ended up resetting my router instead.</p>



<p>The easy way to deal with this? Turn on automatic firmware updates for your router. Depending on the model you own, this can be full automatic updating, or automatic downloads that still require manual installation. If human intervention is involved, make it part of your PC&rsquo;s regular maintenance schedule to check up on your router every so often, too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>(For what it&rsquo;s worth, my setup required full manual downloading and updating, so while I was lazy, I was not outright ignoring options that would have made my life much simpler.)</p>



<h2 id="enable-encryption-and-other-security-settings">Enable encryption and other security settings</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Linksys router showing default Wi-Fi network name and password" class="wp-image-1965497" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG_2988-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Modern routers usually have a default Wi-Fi network name and password already set before you pull it out of the box. </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<p>Your Wi-Fi network needs a password&mdash;and a good method of securing the traffic going to and from the router. Nowadays, most modern routers enable this by default. Pull the device out of the box and you&rsquo;ll already need a password to log on to your home network.</p>



<p>But you shouldn&rsquo;t trust that your router&rsquo;s manufacturer has properly locked down the device. Your Wi-Fi password needs to be strong and unique&mdash;something you can control if you change it. Changing the Wi-Fi network name (aka the SSID) is a good idea, too, since it can give away identifying information about your device. Also, your Wi-Fi encryption protocol should be set to WPA2 at minimum. (If not, change it.) Got shiny new gadgets that support the latest WPA3 protocol, but others that don&rsquo;t? See if your router supports a mixed mode to allow both WPA2 and WPA3 devices on the network at the same time.</p>



<p>Other settings you should check for include Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) and remote access to the router, both of which you should disable. You can read the full rundown on <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/395054/how-to-secure-your-home-wi-fi-network-and-router.html">how to secure your Wi-Fi network</a> in our guide, but these tips cover the basics. Once you&rsquo;ve got everything covered, you can save yourself time down the road by backing up your settings (as mentioned above). You won&rsquo;t need to go through the whole process again if you ever reset the router or need to swap for a different unit (i.e., RMA replacement).</p>



<h2 id="change-the-routers-default-admin-password">Change the router&rsquo;s default admin password</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Screengrabs from the Asus ZenWiFi XT9 Asus Router Android app, displaying the network map and connection status of all connected clients" class="wp-image-1933951" height="886" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Asus-ZenWiFi-XT9-review-Asus-Router-control-panel-app.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>A password is needed to access to all of these settings. Replace the default with a strong, unique one of your own choosing.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thomas Newton / Foundry</p></div>



<p>To access your router&rsquo;s settings, you need a password. The default is usually printed on your device. Sometimes it&rsquo;s included on a card in the box instead. Either way, you should change it.</p>



<p>For older devices, default passwords are easy to discover&mdash;they were often reused across devices and/or listed publicly. If your router&rsquo;s firmware has an unpatched vulnerability, a hacker can exploit it and then gain access to your router. From there it&rsquo;s simple for the attacker to, say, snoop on your network traffic and look for sensitive data. Even with newer routers, which often sport passwords that look randomized and unique, you should change the default. It&rsquo;s the best way to guarantee you&rsquo;ve secured the router with a strong password.</p>



<p>Also, don&rsquo;t make a fatal mistake and use the same password as your Wi-Fi network. Make it different! And, if you have a guest network, use a unique password for it as well. (Otherwise, you&rsquo;re not getting any benefit of separating out guests.) Worried you won&rsquo;t be able to remember so many passwords? A good password manager will take care of that problem. You can easily find one through <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407092/best-password-managers-reviews-and-buying-advice.html">our list of the best services</a>. It doesn&rsquo;t have to cost anything, too.</p>

## LastPass 2FA reset prompts are locking users out of accounts

<p>LastPass&rsquo;s attempts to clean up after security breaches isn&rsquo;t going so well. At least, not for users. Some customers are getting locked out of their accounts after following LastPass&rsquo;s prompt to resync their two-factor authentication&mdash;and they&rsquo;re rightfully angry.</p>



<p>The story goes like this: In 2022, LastPass announced two major security breaches. During the first, which was <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/917244/lastpass-got-hacked-but-you-werent-2.html">revealed in August</a>, source code and proprietary technical information were hijacked. A <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1419901/lastpass-got-hacked-again-and-this-time-your-data-got-taken.html">second breach</a> led to customer data being stolen, including password vault data, some of which was stored unencrypted. </p>



<p>Customers were notified in December 2022, and at that time, LastPass recommended that users reset their 2FA secrets for authenticator apps like LastPass Authenticator, Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, or the equivalent (e.g., Authy) as a precaution. Then in May of this year, the company <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/LastPassHelp/status/1655716360574337024&amp;xcust=2-1-1968336-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">began to prompt </a>customers who hadn&rsquo;t yet made this update to do so.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Authenticator reset prompt" class="wp-image-1968338" height="211" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/lastpass4.png" width="475" /><figcaption>LastPass&rsquo;s prompt for authenticator app reset.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">LastPass</p></div>



<p>But as <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lastpass-users-furious-after-being-locked-out-due-to-mfa-resets/&amp;xcust=2-1-1968336-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Bleeping Computer</a> reports, following <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.lastpass.com/s/document-item?language=en_US&amp;bundleId=lastpass&amp;topicId=LastPass/why_do_i_have_to_reset_my_authenticator_app.html&amp;_LANG=enus&amp;xcust=2-1-1968336-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">LastPass&rsquo;s instructions</a> can lead to account lockouts. Multiple users in LastPass&rsquo;s forums have stated they can&rsquo;t login after resetting their 2FA secret&mdash;and until June 26, they also had no way of contacting support. Premium users had to log into the site to submit a support ticket, and free users simply lacked access to &ldquo;personal&rdquo; one-on-one support. Neither group could get help.</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re stuck in this situation, LastPass now has a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.lastpass.com/s/document-item?language=en_US&amp;bundleId=lastpass&amp;topicId=LastPass/LastPass_Authenticator_disable_lpa.html&amp;_LANG=enus&amp;xcust=2-1-1968336-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">special customer service page</a> for you. Should Option 1&rsquo;s SMS recovery method not work, scroll down to Option 2 and click on the red <em>Contact support</em> button to begin filing a ticket.</p>



<p>As you wait for a response, you may be able to troubleshoot the problem yourself as well&mdash;if you seem to be running up against error messages related to a wrong password. Look for a location verification email in your Inbox or Spam folders. If <em>your security email is different than your login email</em>, check that email address for the email. Click the link in it to verify your IP address. You can tell if you&rsquo;re locked out due to location verification based on the style of the denial message (see below).</p>

<p><em><sup>When location verification is required, the login error message appears above the login form. When you enter a bad password, the error message appears below the login form.</sup></em></p>



<p>If LastPass isn&rsquo;t recognizing the new 2FA codes, and you haven&rsquo;t yet deleted the last secret from your app, try the older codes.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, if these steps don&rsquo;t help (or if you&rsquo;re locked in an <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://community.logmein.com/t5/LastPass-Support-Discussions/Authenticator-Reset/m-p/305738&amp;xcust=2-1-1968336-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">ongoing cycle of authenticator reset notifications</a>), you&rsquo;ll have to wait for LastPass&rsquo;s assistance. With the new direct line of customer support for this particular issue, it will hopefully happen faster&mdash;on June 20, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://community.logmein.com/t5/LastPass-Support-Discussions/Authenticator-Reset/m-p/305738/highlight/true#M47070&amp;xcust=2-1-1968336-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">one user reported</a> being locked out for five days with still no contact from LastPass.</p>



<p>In a statement to Bleeping Computer, LastPass says its prompts for users to resync their 2FA secrets began appearing in early June, in hopes of getting more response. Earlier emails had been sent in March and April 2023 to remind customers. (A check of a PCWorld test account with LastPass does not show a record of these emails, so not all users may have received them.)</p>



<p>If this whole situation seems too messy, you can still leave LastPass&mdash;as others have already done. It&rsquo;s not difficult and takes very little time, as we explain our guide on <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1445758/how-to-export-your-passwords-and-ditch-lastpass.html">How to export your passwords and ditch LastPass</a>.
