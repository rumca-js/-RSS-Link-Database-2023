Luto is a game you might not have heard of, but it\u2019s certainly worth keeping on your radar. Set against the backdrop of a haunted house, you assume the role of an individual unable to leave the confines of this home. \n\nLuto is set to tackle heavy themes of anxiety and depression which couple with its spine-chilling horror gameplay to create something eerily reminiscent of Konami\u2019s PT. Developer Broken Bird Games seems to have a good understanding of what makes psychological horror tick, and if Luto is able to achieve its design goals - it might be one intriguing horror game, when it releases in the near future.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati5GdXCC2I", "date_published": "2023-06-27 15:30:03+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective Review - The Final Verdict", "description": "A blast from the past, Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective is a remaster of the 2011 classic with gorgeous, high-definition visuals and a rearranged soundtrack.
