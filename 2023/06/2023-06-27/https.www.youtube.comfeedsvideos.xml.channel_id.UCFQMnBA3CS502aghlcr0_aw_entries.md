Jordan Belfort responded to my request for comment claiming what I alleged was "Wildly Misleading" so I thought I'd clear the air by reading his full response. It's pretty amusing.

This video is an opinion and in no way should be construed as statements of fact. Scams, bad business opportunities, and fake gurus are subjective terms that mean different things to different people. I think someone who promises $100K/month for an upfront fee of $2K is a scam. Others would call it a Napoleon Hill pitch.
