<p dir="ltr">Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, the highly anticipated finale of the franchise, is set to hit theaters with hopes of surpassing its predecessors at the box office, despite facing the worst reviews in the series. According to analysis by <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/06/indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-box-office-projection-2-1235425453/">Deadline</a>, the film aims to achieve a domestic opening of $60 million to $65 million and a global debut of $140 million or more.</p><p dir="ltr">The performance of popcorn flicks in the post-pandemic era have shown that critical acclaim is not their sole determining factor. Despite unfavorable reviews, Jurassic World: Dominion earned $145 million in its domestic opening. Similarly, The Little Mermaid started with $118.8 million over four days. Dial of Destiny <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/indiana_jones_and_the_dial_of_destiny">holds a 65% fresh rating</a>, lower than previous chapters Raiders of the Lost Ark (93% in 1981), Temple of Doom (77% in 1984), Last Crusade (84% in 1989), and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (77% in 2008).</p><p dir="ltr">Note that the projected figures mentioned are for the standard 3-day weekend, excluding the extended five-day period with the Independence Day holiday that Dial of Destiny will benefit from after premiering stateside on June 30.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-dial-of-destiny-defy-critics-with-a-140-million-global-debut/1100-6515533/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cyberpunk-2077/">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s launch wasn't nearly as bad as reviews made it out to be, at least according to CD Projekt Red vice president of public relations Michał Platkow-Gilewski.</p><p dir="ltr">In a recent <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/cd-projekt-we-need-to-fix-the-relationship-with-our-players">interview with GamesIndustry.biz</a> (via <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-launch-cd-projekt-red-phantom-liberty-1850581473">Kotaku</a>), Platkow-Gilewski chalked up the game's poor reception to bandwagoning, stating that, at some point, it became "cool" to hate the game.</p><p dir="ltr">"I actually believe Cyberpunk, on launch, was way better than it was received," he said. "And <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-review/1900-6417622/">even the first reviews</a> were positive. Then it became a cool thing not to like it.

## Hearthstone "Titans" Expansion Brings Warcraft's Gods Into Play

<p>Hearthstone's next expansion will be named and themed after the most powerful beings in the Warcraft universe: Titans. The new set will introduce 145 new cards, including 11 Legendary "Titan" cards to represent each of Hearthstone's classes. The expansion will also include a new keyword, Forge, and the return of the Magnetic keyword. The new expansion is coming on August 1, and starting July 27 you can login for a free Prison of Yogg-Saron legendary neutral card.</p><p>To match the theme, the <strong>Titans</strong> will be extra-powerful in a few different ways. Each comes with a passive ability, along with three active abilities that can be tapped in whatever order you choose, similar to the single-ability <strong>Locations</strong>. Once you've tapped all three, the Titan will be able to attack normally using its regular attack and health stats.</p><p>The expansion will also introduce a new <strong>Forge</strong> keyword. For the cost of two mana, you can drag a Forge card to your deck to hammer out an extra ability. The upgraded version will then return straight to your hand. This will be added alongside the return of the <strong>Magnetic</strong> keyword, which lets Mechs stick to each other and combine their stats. But in a major revision, Magnetic cards will no longer require an empty space on the board to play.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hearthstone-titans-expansion-brings-warcrafts-gods-into-play/1100-6515489/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

You'll have to use every advantage and dirty trick in the book to defeat the Banished Court, and every mission earns your team new resources and grows their abilities.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-lamplighters-league-preorders-are-discounted/1100-6515506/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

The current content plans for the MMO remain in place.</p><p>In a <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2023/06/27/bright-future-for-swtor/">prepared statement</a>, BioWare's general manager Adam McKay emphasized that the MMO has been a huge success. He said, "It’s the longest-running live service Star Wars game ever and we’re enormously proud of the work the team has done in creating, expanding, and maintaining this incredible game." He added that, "[the change] means that players will continue to enjoy the SWTOR they know and love." In addition to previously announced plans, SWTOR will be receiving further updates that have not yet been revealed.</p><p>The majority of the current SWTOR team will continue to work on the MMO under Broadsword. However, not every role has been invited to move. McKay said, "This is the hardest part of this transition, and these decisions were not made lightly.

<p>New court documents reveal that if Microsoft had acquired Sega, it planned to continue to release Sega's games on other platforms. This plan was uncovered via a strategy document, released during the ongoing trial between Microsoft and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to determine the fate of the tech giant's attempted acquisition of Activision Blizzard.</p><p>A court document reviewed by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-said-it-would-have-kept-sega-games-multiplatform-after-proposed-buyout">IGN</a> says that the plans were as follows. Microsoft would have acquired Sega and worked with the company operating on a set of general principles. First, Microsoft would continue to develop and sell acquired games on relevant platforms. Second, titles formerly exclusive to PlayStation and/or Nintendo consoles would be ported to Xbox. Third, all acquired games and franchises would launch on Xbox Game Pass for PC, console, and the cloud.</p><p>Microsoft has faced frequent skepticism for its claim that Call of Duty would remain on PlayStation post-acquisition. PlayStation versions of Starfield and Redfall were canceled after Microsoft acquired developer and publisher Bethesda. However, Microsoft had made no promise to keep those games on other platforms, nor had they been announced for them.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-planned-to-keep-sega-games-multiplatform-had-acquisition-happenedm/1100-6515516/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Freddy Fazbear (and all his terrifying friends) are headed to the big screen with Five Nights At Freddy's, a feature film based on the popular horror game scheduled to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/five-nights-at-freddys-movie-confirmed-for-october-release/1100-6513020/">arrive in theaters later this year</a>.

The film seems to be sticking closely to the source material, with the game's animatronics--and even its <a href="https://freddy-fazbears-pizza.fandom.com/wiki/Cupcake_Animatronics">infamous cupcake</a>--appearing in the trailer with next to no alterations to their appearance.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">But the film isn't an exact replica of the game.

## The Barbie Movie Soundtrack Includes A Power Ballad Sung By Ryan Gosling

<p>Compiling a movie soundtrack is almost never easy, but director Greta Gerwig has built an incredible playlist made of some of today's top artists--and Ryan Gosling. The Barbie soundtrack is one of the most important tools at Gerwig's disposal that's about to paint the world pink.</p><p>Many of the film’s scenes have highly specific musical cues that she was seeking, which means she needed a team on board from the beginning to make the vision come alive.

<p dir="ltr">While the transition from Henry Cavill to Liam Hemsworth as Geralt in Netflix's The Witcher series might sound jarring, the show's executive producer believes it will be "quite flawless."</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with <a href="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/witcher-producers-henry-cavill-left-070033481.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9yZWRhbmlhbmludGVsbGlnZW5jZS5jb20v&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAABS5izdbqlYNL3PID676VLpSkFwR6emuFxAu_BiexkaisVQFgXbD9gIB2gsE45Mzc9InsnYCIARymqveVBk3Sr6wmsEoDo07SHUIOzoOAxOJF-qCkK2h9e8P4Mtnv5mXc91y-KAIxY6g7-OthM3LkWTRNl46ewcAGv-Ydbr3mjNT&amp;guccounter=1">Yahoo UK</a>, executive producer Tomek Baginski opened up about the monumental change for The Witcher.

## Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged Is Revving Up To Its Name

<p>2021's Hot Wheels Unleashed set the stage for a new era of Hot Wheels racing games. It wasn't <em>just </em>a racing game, but a celebration of the tiny toy cars that felt larger-than-life thanks to the game's physics-based racing and grandiose scale of its environments. Those pillars are what made Hot Wheels Unleashed feel distinct, and not just from Hot Wheels games of the past, but even among other contemporary arcade racing games. It's a distinction that developer Milestone seems to be doubling down on for its sequel Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged. Or, maybe rather, double jumping on?</p><p dir="ltr">In every sense of its name, Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged is very much turbocharged, with new features, vehicle types, environments, and a set of new moves. During our 30 minutes of hands-on time with the demo, we zipped and drifted around some of its new environments and tried out some of the new moves, including a double jump, which allows you to jump over other cars, reach new areas, or strategically recover after falling off the track. Additionally, players can also perform a lateral drift, which lets drivers instantly move vehicles sideways like something out of Speed Racer, enabling you to bump other cars out of the way, instantly avoid obstacles, or, once again, help you from falling off the track (which can happen pretty often).</p><p dir="ltr">These new moves are a welcome improvement while still maintaining the feel of driving and drifting familiar to returning players. The original's race-drift-ramp rinse-repeat formula felt repetitive quickly to me, so the added variety feels more substantial than just a few new tricks and gives meaningful depth to its racing. In fact, the double jump felt very similar to Rocket League--another physics-based car game and one that nurtured a competitive scene. The devs told me that Rocket League was absolutely a point of inspiration, especially for its aerial gameplay, but their focus wasn't to match Rocket League's competitive skill ceiling. Instead, their intentions were to give players more creative freedom in how to race. Still, it's the creativity of the players that will inevitably define that skill ceiling, so it'll be exciting to see how players use these moves when the game releases.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hot-wheels-unleashed-2-turbocharged-is-revving-up-to-its-name/1100-6515497/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## The Original Pitch For Alan Wake 2 Included Live Action, TV-Style Cutscenes Like Quantum Break

<p>The original pitch for Alan Wake 2 included TV-style live action cutscenes. Microsoft showed interest in that idea, but little in a sequel to the cult classic supernatural action game. This pitch evolved into Quantum Break, which Microsoft published.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-turned-down-alan-wake-2-pitch-with-tv-style-episodes-for-quantum-break-instead">Eurogamer</a> at Summer Game Fest, Remedy creative director Sam Lake discussed the pitching process for Alan Wake 2. Lake said, "so, we were creating a concept of Alan Wake 2, we were showing it to Microsoft--but other publishers as well at the time--and it was maybe slightly awkward timing as, you know, the industry shifts and changes along the way."</p><p>"It was at the time where clearly there was feeling that linear single player games are a thing of the past. Well, single-player story obviously is huge these days, but at the time, it felt like nobody was really interested."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-original-pitch-for-alan-wake-2-included-live-action-tv-style-cutscenes-like-quantum-break/1100-6515512/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown Lets You Use Screenshots In A Helpful Way

<p>Photo modes have become a popular feature in games, and for the upcoming Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, Ubisoft is putting a neat twist on that mode that sounds very helpful for a metroidvania-inspired adventure. Called The Eye of the Wanderer, this option allows for screenshots to be pinned to the map in order to help you out with exploration.</p><p>"The genre is quite dependent on being able to 'take mental notes'; remembering and visualizing things like blocked paths, or situations that need tools or powers that you don't have," senior game designer Remi Boutin explained to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-will-let-players-pin-screenshots-to-the-map">Eurogamer</a>. "We know that can be a barrier for some players, so to assist with this the Eye of the Wanderer feature allows you to take a screenshot and pin it to the map as a visual reminder."</p><p>According to Boutin, the development team at Ubisoft Montpellier wanted to ensure that "the greatest number of players" could enjoy the game with accessibility options like this, and the studio identified exploration as a key area to focus on. "Ensuring players can feel the thrill of free exploration without the frustration of feeling lost was a strong area of focus for us from the very start of development," Boutin said.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-lets-you-use-screenshots-in-a-helpful-way/1100-6515508/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Circana (previously known as NPD), has released its monthly video game report in the United States, this time for May 2023. Overall video game spending grew from the same time last year, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> became the month's best-selling game. The Nintendo Switch was the best-selling platform for the month, as well.</p><p>Tears of the Kingdom is now the second-best-selling game of 2023, trailing only <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hogwarts-legacy/">Hogwarts Legacy</a>. However, it's important to note that digital Nintendo sales are not tracked, meaning Tears of the Kingdom reached this milestone on boxed copies alone. Speaking of which, Hogwarts Legacy was May's second-best-selling game, thanks in part to the PS4 and Xbox One versions launching that month.</p><p>The top five best-sellers for May 2023 consist of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Hogwarts Legacy, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, Dead Island 2, and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/top-10-best-selling-games-of-may-2023-revealed-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-takes-top-spot/1100-6515507/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Everybody 1-2 Switch Is A Mostly Okay Party Game

<p dir="ltr">It's hard to remember a game from a major publisher that faced the same headwinds as Everybody 1-2 Switch. In 2022, before its official announcement, <a href="https://www.fanbyte.com/games/news/the-wild-story-behind-nintendos-unannounced-1-2-switch-sequel/">Fanbyte</a> reported that the game had done especially poorly in focus testing, leading Nintendo to consider the possibility of scrapping the project altogether. Then, this year, Nintendo <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/everybody-1-2-switch-announced-for-nintendo-switch/1100-6514753/">surprise-announced</a> that Everybody 1-2 Switch is in fact coming, and very soon at that, for a discount price of $30 USD (the original game cost $50). So I approached a recent hands-on session with a sort of morbid curiosity--would this be as bad as the report suggested, or had Nintendo sufficiently turned things around? Based on limited play time in a very large group dynamic, it seems like a decent party game--with one notable exception that, if indicative of more minigames like it, could really sour the experience.</p><p dir="ltr">We played a set of five minigames, showcasing the different styles of play. Some games could be played with Switch Joy-Cons, others with a mobile smart device, and some games could simultaneously support any combination of both. The latter options are how Everybody 1-2 Switch achieves the recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendos-everybody-1-2-switch-has-100-player-mode-and-can-be-played-with-your-phone/1100-6515356/">announced 100-player count</a> for certain minigames. Our group for the preview was around 15 people--a much smaller number but it still got the point across that you can play these games with a big group.</p><p dir="ltr">The first game we played was Balloons, which used the Joy-Cons. We were divided randomly into teams--you can ask the game to pick them for you--and each one would be shown a brief flash of a balloon silhouette. You'd then have to move the controller like a bicycle pump to inflate your balloon, trying to match as closely as possible to the silhouette without going over. If you went even a single pump too far, it popped. But since everyone on the team was contributing to the pumping, you would need to communicate when to stop and whether the balloon could take one more pump--and if so, who should be the one to do it. It had the raucous, risky energy of Jenga, amplified by all the moves happening simultaneously. A round was done in less than a minute, and the winner was best out of five.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/everybody-1-2-switch-is-a-mostly-okay-party-game/1100-6515500/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
