That is what this guy did. The difference is you would not become a blubbering mess as the guy -- who threatened to kill your family -- was arrested because you were afraid the guy  -- who threatened to kill your family -- might think you're racist.</p><p>If you are allergic to soy, I would suggest not watching this video (<a href="https://notthebee.com/article/this-white-guys-sobs-to-police-after-they-arrest-a-black-man-he-reported-for-threatening-to-stab-his-family-to-death" target="_blank">which turns out is from 2022</a>).</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</p><p>An armed man threatened to kill his family... what did Soy McSimp think the cop was going to do when he called 911? Tell the man to go sit in the corner? Give him detention? Drop him off at the subway with a copy of Michael Jackson Karaoke?</p><p>The cop even tried reasoning with Soy, asking him if the homeless guy who threatened to stab his family to death did what McSimp said he did. There was no calming McSimp down.</p><blockquote>Now he's gonna think I'm doing this because I'm white and he's black! Or he's homeless and I'm not! I don't want that!  I don't want him thinking I did it because he's in whatever situation he's in. I just want him to leave us alone.</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>The saddest thing about this is it wasn't performative. He wasn't on TikTok emoting <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/traffic-atlanta" target="_blank">how traffic is racist</a> or <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/weight-loss-racist" target="_blank">telling a fatty to lose weight is racist</a>. McSimp didn't know he was performing for an audience of the entire internet. He had a legit existential crisis over whether his white privilege was showing in the way he did not want his family stabbed to death. Just because the unhoused homeless person who threatened to murder his family was also blaaaaaaaack.</p><p>I'd love to know what his wife told her other boyfriend about all this.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Tough-talking union boss challenges GOP Senator to a fight, doesn't realize Senator is an undefeated MMA fighter

A Union Boss challenged a sitting GOP senator to a fight, and the senator accepted. Only unlike other checks the union boss writes that he ass can't catch, he can't rely on Democrat politicians to bail him out of this one. The GOP senator he challenged is undefeated in MMA.</p><p>Markwayne Mullin is the junior Republican senator, a wrestling coach, and a father to two Oklahoma State Wrestling Champions, his son Jayce and his daughter Larra. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/markwaye-mullin-son-daughter" target="_blank">They were featured in his campaign ad</a> attempting to explain to Democrats what a woman was. He also has 3-0 MMA record <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Markwayne-Mullin-22106" target="_blank">fighting for the Xtreme Fighting League</a>. A detail that Teamster boss Sean O'Brien might not have realized when he challenged Mullin to a fight.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>

<p>As <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/4068607-gop-senator-challenges-teamsters-boss-to-mma-fight-for-charity/" target="_blank">The Hill reports</a>, Mullin is also a successful Oklahoma businessman who did not use union labor before selling his companies. O'Brien's job as a union boss is to bully companies into bending their knee to unions, then trying to get Democrats to change laws when that doesn't work. So the two had beef before a Senate Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee hearing in March where the two had words.</p><p>Why it took O'Brien three months to issue the challenge is unclear, but he should have thought it through more. Sen. Mullin named the time (September 30th), the place (Oklahoma), and is giving O'Brien three months to run through a fight camp.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>O'Brien has two more days to respond to the challenge, which he has not done as of this writing. I would hope does. After all, he DID say anytime and anyplace.  September 30th is a time and Oklahoma is a place. I would hate to find out we live in an America where Teamsters are nothing but pussies. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## San Francisco Mayor attacks DeSantis for calling city a cesspool, claims the drugs and poop are only a "snapshot"

Oh, and drugs too. Can't forget about the drugs. Breed was asked to respond and said that the crime and poop and drugs are only a "snapshot" of her fair city. She doesn't need complaints. She needs solutions!</p><p>And for solutions, she named dropped two politicians with a century's worth of elected office between them as people who have them.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<blockquote>Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been actively engaged and working in the federal government to help deal with these challenges.</blockquote><p>Nancy Pelosi has been involved in San Francisco politics for forty-two years. When Breed was first appointed acting Mayor in January 2018 while the fecal-lined streets <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/san-francisco-shithole" target="_blank">became such a problem they created a poop tracking device so citizens could avoid the poop</a>, Pelosi was House Minority Leader in between her two stints as speaker. I'm sure those "solutions" are coming any minute now.</p><blockquote>President Joe Biden was just here in San Francisco yesterday talking about climate change and artificial intelligence. So they're talking about solutions.</blockquote><p>Set aside neither of those things address the problems in San Francisco and other progressive cities, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-california" target="_blank">this was Joe Biden in "San Francisco."</a></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>London Breed says we need solutions. And she says conservatives like Ron DeSantis don't provide any. That's bootycheeks. DeSantis saying "Everything the left has been doing for decades, we're going to do the exact opposite" IS the solution.</p><p>The people without solutions are the low-information, progressive voters in cities like San Francisco. They vote for the same failed ideology every election. Then wonder why the city has turned out the way it has. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

They say it's real. Dana White says it's real. He had a t-shirt made. There was a time when no one thought a Conor McGregor vs Floyd Mayweather fight would happen. If nothing else, it's fun to pretend. Plus as we say here at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website, these clicks don't bait themselves.</p><p>We have good news and bad news on the fight front, and all from the Elon Musk camp. Shout out to Team Zuck for keeping a tight circle. The bad news is that Elon's mom is involved, and Maye Musk says the fight is off.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>This is not the first time Mama Musk has gone Mama Grizzly and tried to fight her baby boy's fight for him. When <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-mother-nyt" target="_blank">corporate journalismers</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-mother-warren-sanders" target="_blank">socialist senators</a> have attacked Elon, Maye made it clear if they wanted to get to Elon they had to go to her first. Maye is spicy and has shown to have no f*cks to give.</p><p>However if Elon grows a set and doesn't let his mother tell him what to do, he has his MMA trainer. UFC Hall of Famer and one of. the best pound-for-pound to ever do it, Georges St. Pierre. The former dual weight class champion reached out to Elon to say he was a huge fan, and that it would be his honor to train Elon for the Zuckerberg fight. Musk said he was in and is now an official member of Tristar Gym as far as we're concerned.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>The fight has to happen. Uncle Dana says it's going to happen. In the immortal words of Bruce Buffer... actually, he'll send us a cease in desist. In the immortal words of baby brother Bruce Buffer, IT'S TIME!</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Watch: Barstool's Dave Portnoy goes berserk on "pink-haired, crazy liberals" looking to ban wood-fired pizza

	When it was announced that unelected progressive bureaucrats had a scheme to ruin pizza in New York City, you had to know that Dave Portnoy, America's pizza critic, would be activated. Spoiler: he disagrees with the new rule. And during an emergency press conference, he went off on the pink-haired, crazy liberals who have zeroed in on pizza as the latest thing Americans enjoy that they want to ruin.
</p><p>
	"But Brodigan, why do I care about NYC banning pizza?"
</p><p>
	For the same reason you need to care about the insane things California comes up with. What starts in NY/CA becomes the latest thing the left supports nationwide. Especially the more they hear people they don't like disagreeing with it.

<blockquote>Do you know what's going on in New York? You've got trash in the city. You've got rats. You've got people getting slashed on the subway. You've got flash mobs robbing stores. Can you're comping for coal-oven pizzerias?</blockquote><p>Yep. You would think New York had more important things to deal with, yet herewe are.</p><h3>Why is NYC banning pizza?</h3><br /><p>In order to lower NYC's carbon footprint, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nyc-wood-fired-pizza" target="_blank">the city has decided to target 100 pizzerias</a> that cook using wood-fired or coal-fired ovens, demanding they cut carbon emissions up to 75%. Pizzerias with these ovens made before 2016 will be forced to buy expensive emission control devices while attempting to operate in one of the most expensive cities in America to run a business. </p><p>In a statement, NYC DEP spokesman Ted Timbers called this a "common-sense rule" that was developed with restaurant groups and whatever the hell "environmental justice" groups are.</p><h3>Will NYC voters allow a pizza ban to happen?</h3><br /><p>Of course, they will. This is what New Yorkers voted for. They may not have realized it. They let themselves get distracted by social issues and in 2022 voted on abortion "rights." Even though there is more of a chance New York legalizes abortion to the eleventh trimester than <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-child" target="_blank">place a single restriction on your choice to abort a child</a>. They let New York Democrats distract them with what Ron DeSantis is doing in Florida, the state they're going to move to as New York gets too expensive and crime-ridden to live in.</p><p>Crime, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kathy-hochul-locking-up-criminals" target="_blank">that Kathy Hochul laughed about</a>. And because of predominately New York City voters, they re-elected her governor anyway. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kathy-hochul-gas-stoves" target="_blank">Enjoy your gas stoves while you still can</a>.</p><p>Radical progressives have made it clear their agenda is to regulate how you live in every aspect of your life. And that they'll do it through unelected bureaucracy knowing how unpopular their agenda is. New York City voters keep reelecting them then complain about it.  </p><p>Today it is wood-fired ovens. Next, it's going to be wood-fired barbeques. Then the left is going to move on to what you cook in your own backyard. This latest New York City regulation is another warning sign of what's coming next.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
