Horror games have been on a hot streak as of late with rgames (like Dead Space Remake) being the smash hits they were, and the future seems set to retain that upward trajectory for the genre. Luto is a game you might not have heard of, but it’s certainly worth keeping on your radar. Set against the backdrop of a haunted house, you assume the role of an individual unable to leave the confines of this home. 

Luto is set to tackle heavy themes of anxiety and depression which couple with its spine-chilling horror gameplay to create something eerily reminiscent of Konami’s PT. Developer Broken Bird Games seems to have a good understanding of what makes psychological horror tick, and if Luto is able to achieve its design goals - it might be one intriguing horror game, when it releases in the near future.

A blast from the past, Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective is a remaster of the 2011 classic with gorgeous, high-definition visuals and a rearranged soundtrack. It's about Sissel, a spirit trying to solve the mystery of his murder while ensuring a mysterious woman, Lynne, stays alive.

Sissel can change events and alter fate by possessing and manipulating different objects with his ghost powers. There are hints of something bigger going on, but the sharp writing and excellent characterization keep the plot entertaining, even with the occasionally frustrating puzzle.

Even if it doesn't boast any major gameplay changes, Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective is an enjoyable experience. The involving narrative and unique mechanics will keep you hooked, even if there isn't much replay value.
