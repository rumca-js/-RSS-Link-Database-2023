The team that made it gave the M4 large wheels that can, in seconds, swing up to become something more akin to a drone’s rotors and fly. It can also use its rotors to help it up a steep slope while the back wheels drive it forward from the ground, as described <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39018-y">in a paper in <em>Nature...</em></a></p>

<p id="OHUtJU">Perhaps the more obvious redesign is coming to the Android robot head, which is starting to appear in 3D in official Google marketing materials. Google used a bunch of versions of the 3D head in its Google I/O 2023 keynote, and the company appears willing to show them in different colors and textures instead of just the standard Android green. <em>9to5Google’s </em>article has a gallery of a few other examples, including the 3D Android robot heads at CES and in Google ads.</p>

Just like the games, the movie is an animatronic nightmare about possessed mascots at a pizza place. The movie version stars <em>The Hunger Games</em>’ Josh Hutcherson as a security guard struggling to deal with this reality. (If the premise sounds familiar, it might be because of the conceptually similar Nicolas Cage film <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v27rfaoB2Y"><em>Willy’s Wonderland</em></a> from 2021.)</p>

  <p id="ZS9qXe">The Go 3 is Insta360’s latest pill-shaped action camera, and it’s got a neat trick — the camera’s detachable case now includes a flip-up screen for a live view of what you’re recording.</p>
<p id="KICfh8">Instead of relying on a smartphone to see what you record (or estimate your composition), the Go 3’s case gives a real-time live view whether the camera is inserted or remote. Like the previous <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22319707/insta360-go-2-action-camera-test-price-specs-features">Go 2</a>, the case also charges the camera, extending its battery life from 45 minutes on a single charge to 170 minutes. Though, the capabilities of the Go 3’s case and other refinements also mean it costs more than its previous model, with the base 32GB configuration <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.insta360.com%2Fproduct%2Fgo-3&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2023%2F6%2F27%2F23775300%2Finsta360-go-3-vlogging-action-video-camera-price-specs-availability" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">available now</a> for $379.99 (the Go 2 cost $299.99 at launch).</p>

The new tools give parents the ability to see how much time their child is spending on Messenger, as well as gain more insight into how well their teen really knows the people they’re following on Instagram (and who follows them).</p>
<p id="70cb3x">The company says parents and guardians can now check into their child’s Messenger contacts list, along with their privacy and safety settings from the <a href="https://familycenter.meta.com/">Meta Family Center</a>. Parents will also get notified if their child reports someone on the app — so long as their teen enabled that setting, in addition to seeing who can and can’t message them.</p>

  <p id="Ng8DWu">A new wave of layoffs primarily targeting Ford Motor employees in engineering roles in the US and Canada are expected to take place this week as part of the company’s latest cost-cutting efforts. Leaders of the teams impacted by the job cuts received confirmation on Monday, according to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/26/ford-engineering-layoffs-us-canada.html"><em>CNBC News</em></a><em>,</em> while employees are expected to be notified over the next few days. </p>
<p id="8xtHRd">Ford declined <em>The Verge</em>’s request to clarify how many employees would be affected by the layoffs. Roles are expected to be cut across all three of Ford’s business units — Ford Blue (the company’s arm for vehicles with traditional combustion engines), Ford Pro (its commercial vehicle services and distribution business), and Model e (focusing on electric vehicles).</p>
