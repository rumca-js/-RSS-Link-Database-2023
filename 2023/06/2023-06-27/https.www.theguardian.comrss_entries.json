But Sands turned out to be a rarer, stranger and more exotic flower than any of them, virtually impossible to cast as a conventional lead and almost as difficult as a character turn. And this was due to his extraordinarily (and to his fans, hypnotically) eccentric screen presence \u2013 distrait, elegant, deadly serious and otherworldly \u2013 and that utterly distinctive voice: softly melodious, slightly strangulated, nasal and decelerated; he delivered lines at about 60 to 70% of the speed at which other actors spoke. These were mannerisms that became more pronounced and sometimes baffling as he got older. And yet there was always a charisma in his oddity that gave him a long and busy screen career, particularly in horror and cult movies in which audiences loved him.</p><p>I will always remember his breakthrough appearance in the Merchant-Ivory movie A Room With a View, in which he played George Emerson, the innocently honest lover of art from a d\u00e9class\u00e9 background whose unaffected passion captivates Helena Bonham Carter\u2019s Lucy Honeychurch in Florence \u2013 and is in sharp distinction to her pretentious, unfeeling fiance Cecil Vyse, played by Daniel Day-Lewis. Sands\u2019s George leaps impulsively into trees, declaiming \u201cBeauty! Beauty!\u201d and kisses Lucy in a poppy field with a mad audacity which is of a piece with his defiant, weirdly innocent admiration for her loveliness.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/27/julian-sands-an-hypnotically-exotic-actor-full-of-style-and-extravagance\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/27/julian-sands-an-hypnotically-exotic-actor-full-of-style-and-extravagance", "date_published": "2023-06-27 21:30:46+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Superman: Legacy: David Corenswet and Rachel Brosnahan to play leads", "description": "<p>The Pearl actor and The Marvelous Mrs Maisel Emmy-winner will play Superman and Lois Lane in director James Gunn\u2019s new reboot</p><p>David Corenswet and Rachel Brosnahan are set to take on the roles of Superman and Lois Lane in James Gunn\u2019s Superman: Legacy.</p><p>Corenswet is best known for his roles in the Ryan Murphy shows Hollywood and The Politician and starring in 2022 horror prequel Pearl.

Standing like an imposing Victorian workhouse in London\u2019s Bethnal Green, its cavernous interior has always had the air of a mausoleum of toys, with stacks of dusty games sealed disappointingly behind glass. Rows of Victorian doll\u2019s houses and their haunted inhabitants stared out from sombre ranks of vitrines, in a way that seemed more geared towards antique collectors than kids. As its name suggests, it was a place where childhood went to die, providing a trip down memory lane for parents and grandparents, while their own children longed to be taken to the soft play centre.<br /><br />All that has changed. After a three-year, \u00a313m makeover, the cobwebs have been well and truly blown away, the gloomy building injected with dazzling new energy and a mischievous sense of fun \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jun/26/cultural-education-disparity-schools-v-and-a-tristram-hunt\">now fittingly rebranded as Young V&amp;A</a>.<br /><br />\u201cIt\u2019s about stimulating creativity, curiosity and ingenuity,\u201d says Philippa Simpson, the V&amp;A\u2019s director of design, estate and public programme. \u201cWe want to encourage the next generation of designers, makers and doers \u2013 not be a nostalgia fest for parents.\u201d<br /><br />The project is the work of architects <a href=\"https://www.dematosryan.co.uk/archive/the-museum-of-childhood/\">De Matos Ryan </a>(DMR), who were responsible for the main structural changes, and <a href=\"https://www.theaoc.co.uk/projects/v-a-museum-of-childhood/\">AOC</a>, which handled the interiors and exhibition design.

Thanks to Kishii\u2019s luminous performance, Keiko comes across as a very self-sufficient but lonely figure, completely deaf since birth, who finds in fighting some kind of release and sensory thrill, even though her lack of hearing creates very specific challenges in the ring given she can\u2019t hear shouted instructions from her coaches or even the bell.</p><p>Keiko\u2019s family \u2013 mum (Hiroko Nakajima) and brother Seiji (Himi Sat\u00f4), with whom she communicates mostly via sign \u2013 are supportive but don\u2019t really get the sport\u2019s appeal, and that sort of goes for the co-workers at her day job as a hotel housekeeper.

But what precisely gets inflamed, and why \u2013 and is it always a bad thing?</p><p>To understand what can go wrong with our bodies, it helps to remember that they haven\u2019t evolved much since we were hunting and gathering a few thousand years ago. Our greedy response to sugar, for instance, worked well when we could only get it from wild berries; now that it\u2019s combined with salt and fat into foods we can\u2019t stop eating, it can be a problem. Or consider our stress response: if the only time your body reroutes resources from the immune system to your fight-or-flight system is during the occasional sabre-toothed tiger attack, that\u2019s fine. If every mean tweet, upsetting headline or twinge of worry about the mortgage sends your systems into panic mode, your body never gets a chance to recuperate.</p><p>Inflammation, one of the least understood and most debated topics in health, works a bit like this. There are hundreds of cookbooks that promise to deliver an \u201canti-inflammatory diet\u201d, with supplements, gels, teas, workouts, saunas and cryotherapy chambers offering the possibility of even more dramatic results. But inflammation, at its core, is a vital part of the body\u2019s immune response \u2013 not something to try to eliminate. It is a complex biological process that occurs when the body detects harmful stimuli and its purpose is to protect you and kickstart healing. Sometimes this process gets out of control, leading to chronic inflammation that damages rather than heals. The tricky part? Our understanding of this process is evolving: there is a chance that, if you tweak your knee on a five-a-side pitch, you will still be given medical advice that was flipped on its head a decade ago.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/27/the-truth-about-inflammation-all-you-need-to-know-about-2023s-hottest-health-topic-from-causes-to-cures\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/27/the-truth-about-inflammation-all-you-need-to-know-about-2023s-hottest-health-topic-from-causes-to-cures", "date_published": "2023-06-27 04:00:08+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Wales to clamp down on junk food meal deals to tackle obesity", "description": "<p>Welsh government says it will go further than UK government\u2019s plans for England in trying to encourage healthier eating</p><p>Clampdowns on unhealthy meal deals and supermarket temporary price reductions for foods high in fat, sugar or salt are to be introduced in Wales to help tackle the obesity crisis.</p><p>With almost two-thirds of adults in Wales overweight or obese, the Labour-led government announced it would go further than England in framing laws designed to tackle the promotion of ultra-processed foods.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/27/wales-to-clamp-down-on-junk-food-meal-deals-to-tackle-obesity\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/27/wales-to-clamp-down-on-junk-food-meal-deals-to-tackle-obesity", "date_published": "2023-06-27 04:00:08+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Why are orcas attacking boats and is the behaviour spreading? \u2013 podcast", "description": "<p>Since 2020, orcas off the coast of Spain and Portugal have been ramming boats, biting rudders and, in a few cases, sinking entire vessels.
