On an election day, the bus might pull up to a polling place to play music or give out water and snacks.</p><p>Then Georgia’s legislature made it a crime to hand out food or water to people in line to vote. Albright said the change seemed specifically designed to target groups like his, and it’s just one way that voting advocates have had to adapt to new, restrictive laws since the US supreme court gutted the Voting Rights Act ten years ago.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/27/supreme-court-voter-suppression-us-south-voting-advocates-election">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Why does the Kansas City pitcher keep getting chances to lose? Sometimes it’s easy to underestimate those athletes for whom availability is a virtue </p><p>The poet Elizabeth Bishop <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/47536/one-art">once wrote</a> that “the art of losing isn’t hard to master.” The exception to that rule may be Kansas City Royals starting pitcher Jordan Lyles, who has proven it takes a special kind of talent to consistently lose at the major league level. He’s shown, in fact, it’s possible to make a nice career out of it.</p><p>While his career has mostly flown under the radar, Lyles was making headlines for the worst possible reasons in 2023. Before <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/recap/_/gameId/401472166">Saturday’s 9-4 victory</a> over the Tampa Bay Rays, the Royals had lost all 15 games he had started this season, with Lyles himself going 0-11 in those appearances.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/27/jordan-lyles-kansas-city-royals-mlb-baseball-era-losses">Continue reading...</a>
