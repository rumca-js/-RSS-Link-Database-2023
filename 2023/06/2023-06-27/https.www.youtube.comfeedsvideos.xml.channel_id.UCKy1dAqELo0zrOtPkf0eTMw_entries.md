With “Dial of Destiny” releasing, we’re letting you know all about Indiana Jones : The Story So Far in preparation. Indiana Jones is back for the erstwhile Indiana Jones 5, where we’ll find out what happened to Mutt Williams, if anything. Indiana Jones and The Dial of Destiny stars Harrison Ford in what looks to be the last ride for the character in an Indiana Jones movie at least. Since Raiders of the Last Ark, Harrison Ford has played the leading role of Indiana Jones, Dial of Destiny being the last great adventure for the classic hero.

Lucasfilm has released many an Indiana Jones clip ramping up to the movie release of the presumably last  of the Indiana Jones saga. But should it have ended with Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade? Will there be any carryover from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, or even the Indiana Jones 4 nuke scene? To prepare for it, Indiana Jones 4 and every Indiana Jones sequel there is for that matter, we’re taking you back through Indy history, including Indiana Jones meets Mutt. Did a point of no return get crossed at the “Indiana Jones meets Mutt Williams” scene, and could it be in Indiana Jones 5, Mutt Williams returns?

We know at least the relationship between Indiana Jones and Mutt will matter in some way, but enough of that: what about the non-movies? The Indiana Jones games, Young Indiana Jones, Bethesda Indiana Jones- we’ve got it ALL and more in this recap of Indy history!
