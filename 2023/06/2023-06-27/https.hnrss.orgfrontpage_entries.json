in one place with a common interface. The application uses custom extractors specifically written for each website. This way you can endlessly scroll through posts and save the ones you like without having to deal with ads.<p>With the Endless server I am hosting you can also upvote and leave comments on posts without creating an account! With random tokens linked to your actions you basically use your device as your account and undo your actions in the future without spoiling your identity.<p>I hope to add more extractors in the future. Feel free to install the app and check out the extractors yourself or contribute to the project!

We\u2019re a platform for enterprise developers to build and host mission-critical internal apps.<p>Today we launched Superblocks AI and are excited to hear feedback from the HN community!<p>Superblocks AI combines the power of the Superblocks drag-and-drop App Builder with robust AI code generation, code optimization, code explanation, mock data generation, and API call generation across SQL, Python, JavaScript, JSON and HTML.<p>We built Superblocks AI with the intention to streamline some of the repetitive and often confusing aspects of building internal tools, here\u2019s a brief overview:<p>Generate Code: LLMs like ChatGPT have quickly become a critical part of developers' lives and we wanted to bring that experience natively into our product. The response is streamed for the best UX, similar to Chat-GPT, and can be modified before use.<p>Explain Code: Understanding someone else\u2019s code for large internal engineering teams is often a challenge. Highlight code and Superblocks AI offers an explanation that you then have the ability to add as a comment.<p>Edit Code: You can make alterations to code by highlighting it and choosing prompts like optimize performance, enhance readability, or something custom. We've added an inline code diff view for easy verification of changes.<p>Generate API Calls: You often want to make an API call but need to spend 30 minutes looking up the documentation and crafting the correct call in Postman. We provided a way for you to give a prompt, and Superblocks AI will generate REST and GraphQL queries for APIs like Stripe, Salesforce, your favorite SaaS provider, and more.<p>Generate Mock Data: This enables faster UI development by generating mock data for components like tables, charts, grids etc., which can be especially handy during prototyping.<p>I'd love to hear feedback from the HN community on how you think this feature should evolve over the next few months!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36495680\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36495680</a></p>\n<p>Points: 15</p>\n<p># Comments: 4</p>", "link": "https://www.superblocks.com/blog/introducing-superblocks-ai", "date_published": "2023-06-27 17:00:31+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Rust fact vs. fiction: 5 Insights from Google's Rust journey in 2022", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://opensource.googleblog.com/2023/06/rust-fact-vs-fiction-5-insights-from-googles-rust-journey-2022.html\">https://opensource.googleblog.com/2023/06/rust-fact-vs-fiction-5-insights-from-googles-rust-journey-2022.html</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36495667\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36495667</a></p>\n<p>Points: 104</p>\n<p># Comments: 67</p>", "link": "https://opensource.googleblog.com/2023/06/rust-fact-vs-fiction-5-insights-from-googles-rust-journey-2022.html", "date_published": "2023-06-27 17:00:05+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Patterns of Distributed Systems", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/\">https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36495335\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36495335</a></p>\n<p>Points: 40</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "link": "https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/", "date_published": "2023-06-27 16:43:12+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Caltech M4 Robot Flies, Rolls, Walks, and More", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/new-bioinspired-robot-flies-rolls-walks-and-more\">https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/new-bioinspired-robot-flies-rolls-walks-and-more</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36494966\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36494966</a></p>\n<p>Points: 39</p>\n<p># Comments: 18</p>", "link": "https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/new-bioinspired-robot-flies-rolls-walks-and-more", "date_published": "2023-06-27 16:19:58+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Zellij New WASM Plugin System", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://zellij.dev/news/new-plugin-system/\">https://zellij.dev/news/new-plugin-system/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36494935\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36494935</a></p>\n<p>Points: 48</p>\n<p># Comments: 10</p>", "link": "https://zellij.dev/news/new-plugin-system/", "date_published": "2023-06-27 16:17:40+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Pompeii archaeologists discover 'pizza' painting", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-66031341\">https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-66031341</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36494776\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36494776</a></p>\n<p>Points: 8</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-66031341", "date_published": "2023-06-27 16:07:05+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Launch HN: Fuse (YC W19) \u2013 Unified API for financial data aggregators", "description": "<p>Hey HN, we\u2019re the co-founders of Fuse (<a href=\"https://www.letsfuse.com/\">https://www.letsfuse.com/</a>).

You\u2019ll probably then experience the following issues: customers unable to use your product because their financial institution is not supported (e.g., credit unions, local or community banks); frequent disconnections; API errors; and high drop-offs during the bank linking flow.<p>We spent 2.5 years developing YSplit, a fintech app providing joint spending cards for couples. Users linked their bank accounts for spend limits but faced issues with unsupported banks and frequent disconnections. We looked at other apps and saw that the ideal solution was to rely on multiple aggregators, but it wasn\u2019t the right use of engineering resources for that startup. Upon pivoting from YSplit, though, we decided to go back to that problem and address it.<p>We provide a UI component for React, React Native, Flutter, iOS & Android native to facilitate bank account linkage within your app. When a user taps on an institution, we use a time series model to identify the most optimal aggregator to show based on historical success rates and disconnection as well as downtime. After linkage, we provide a Fuse access token for querying balance, transactions, and more via our unified API, offering a consistent model irrespective of the aggregator.<p>We also provide other products to translate historical bank data into consumer/business credit risk to help you answer questions like: How much credit can I feel comfortable offering this user or company? Is a user likely to pay me on time? Can I offer instant ACH to this customer?<p>By combining aggregators, you gain from their diverse connection methods, favoring APIs over screen scraping. Our customers have cut disconnections by 16%, increased coverage by 5k institutions in the US, and boosted conversions by 20% with Fuse. Moreover, we support aggregators in Africa, Europe, South America, Australia, and Asia, enabling global product expansion with a single API.<p>We don't store personal info and only act as a pass-through. We are currently undergoing SOC 2 II audit and can provide engagement letters for anyone looking to go to production.<p>We have a self-serve onboarding   <a href=\"https://dashboard.letsfuse.com\">https://dashboard.letsfuse.com</a> to get sandbox keys. Our docs are available here <a href=\"https://docs.letsfuse.com\">https://docs.letsfuse.com</a>. We\u2019d love for you to try it and give us feedback on improvements to the product and docs. If you have any feature requests or any aggregators you\u2019d like us to support, let us know.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a

In addition, you can create embeddings from sensitive text and documents and perform vector searches to improve your prompt context all while keeping the data confidential.<p>Developers are using Cape with data like financial statements, legal contracts, and internal/proprietary knowledge that would otherwise be too sensitive to process with the ChatGPT API.<p>You can try CapeChat, our playground for the API at <a href=\"https://chat.capeprivacy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://chat.capeprivacy.com/</a><p>The Cape API is self-serve, and has a free tier. The main features of the API are:<p>De-identification \u2014 Redacts sensitive data like PII, PCI, and PHI from your text and documents.<p>Re-identification \u2014 Reverts de-identified data back to the original form.<p>Upload documents \u2014 Converts sensitive documents to embeddings (supports PDF, Excel, Word, CSV, TXT, PowerPoint, and Markdown).<p>Vector Search \u2014 Performs a vector search on your embeddings to augment your prompts with context.<p>To do all this, we work with a number of privacy and security techniques.<p>First of all, we process data within a secure enclave, which is an isolated VM with in-memory encryption. The data remains confidential. No human, including our team at Cape or the underlying cloud provider, can see the data.<p>Secondly, within the secure enclave, Cape de-identifies your data by removing PII, PCI, and PHI before it is processed by OpenAI. As GPT-4 generates and streams back the response tokens, we re-identify the data so it becomes readable again.<p>In addition to de-identification, Cape also has API endpoints for embeddings, vector search, and document uploads, which all operate entirely within the secure enclave (no external calls and no sub-processors).<p>Why did we build this?<p>Developers asked us for help! We've been working at the intersection of privacy and AI since 2017, and with the explosion of interest in LLMs we've had a lot of questions from developers.<p>Privacy and security remain one of the biggest barriers to adopting AI like LLMs, particularly for sensitive data.<p>We\u2019ve spoken with many companies who have been experimenting with ChatGPT or the GPT-4 API and they are extremely excited about the potential, however they find taking an LLM powered feature from PoC to production is a major lift, and it\u2019s uncharted territory for many teams. Developers have questions like:<p>- How do we ensure the privacy of our customer\u2019s data if we\u2019re sending it to OpenAI?<p>- How can we securely feed large bodies of internal, proprietary data into GPT-4?<p>- How can we mitigate hallucinations and bias so that we have higher trust in AI generated text?<p>The features of the Cape API are designed to help solve these problems for developers, and we have a number of early customers using the API in production already.<p>To get started, checkout our docs: <a href=\"https://docs.capeprivacy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow
