[{"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Nintendo says it'll be easy to transfer over to its next console", "description": "<p>Nintendo has a bad reputation for its online infrastructure, often being ridiculed for <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-18-nintendo-switch-online-live-cloud-saves-broken.html\"><ins>lagging behind</ins></a> in adopting the latest technologies or features (such as <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017-07-20-nintendos-solution-for-online-voice-chat-feels-half-baked.html\"><ins>requiring a smartphone</ins></a> for voice chat). This includes transitioning user data between your old console and a new one. Fortunately, it sounds like Nintendo is at least looking into making that easier before the launch of its next console.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2023/qa2306.pdf\"><ins>shareholder meeting</ins></a> late last week, when asked if your Nintendo Switch purchases would carry over to future game consoles, President and CEO Shuntaro Furukawa says (via Google Translate), \u201cIn the transition from Nintendo Switch to the next-generation console, we would like to make every effort to ensure that customers can make the transition smoothly while using their Nintendo account.\u201d This seems to imply that Nintendo is at least looking into possibly allowing current Nintendo Switch titles purchased through the eShop to be carried over to whatever comes next. Of course, Nintendo doesn\u2019t make comments about future hardware that hasn\u2019t been announced yet, so take this with a grain of salt.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>As a reminder, previous-generation <a href=\"https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22282/~/can-i-transfer-games-from-older-systems-to-nintendo-switch%3F#:~:text=Nintendo%203DS%20and%20Wii%20U,games%20designed%20for%20other%20systems.\"><ins>Nintendo Wii U games did not carry over to the Switch</ins></a>. This is in stark contrast to Sony and Microsoft, where most last-generation console games work on new consoles. And unlike Microsoft and Sony, Nintendo likes to spice up its controller design with virtually every new console. So sometimes it\u2019s impossible to make a game work on both the new and old console generation.</p><p>At the very least, Nintendo is considering making improvements for its future console. It\u2019s always been a major disappointment, especially for digital game buyers, that previously-owned titles did not carry over to the new console. It\u2019s especially infuriating when the PlayStation 5 can play <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ps5-compatible-games-075940566.html\"><ins>most PlayStation 4 titles</ins></a>, and Xbox Series S and X can play <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/xbox-series-x-s-backward-compatibility-launch-day-142522349.html\"><ins>most Xbox One titles</ins></a> and in some cases Xbox 360 titles. And in Microsoft\u2019s case, the company lets you carry over certain physical titles as well. So, Nintendo has a few options on the table for carrying over existing games. Regardless of what Nintendo\u2019s next console is like, hopefully it\u2019ll work with all the Switch games people have amassed over the years.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-says-itll-be-easy-to-transfer-over-to-its-next-console-211411270.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-says-itll-be-easy-to-transfer-over-to-its-next-console-211411270.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-27 21:14:11+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Podcast app Stitcher is shutting down in August", "description": "<p>Stitcher is shutting down.

The company claims the deal will give owners access to 12,000 more fast charging locations. The Volvo Cars app will help users find and pay for stations.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The move makes Volvo the first European marque to use Tesla's port.

At the time, it hoped charging networks like Chargepoint and Electrify America would support the system. While that has yet to materialize, NACS is quickly gaining support beyond just automakers. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/texas-says-state-funded-ev-charging-stations-need-to-include-teslas-nacs-connector-141517283.html\">Texas will require Tesla's connector</a> on state-funded charging stations, and SAE International is working on a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-sae-is-creating-a-standardized-version-of-teslas-ev-charging-plug-175233691.html\">standardized version of the plug</a>.</p><p>Other car giants are uncertain about using Tesla's tech.

A switch isn't necessarily easy. Makers like Hyundai and Porsche have 800-volt architectures that allow faster charging than existing Superchargers, and they'd either have to press Tesla for upgraded technology or accept less-than-ideal charging rates.

Maybe the hardware your ISP gave you isn\u2019t great, or your walls aren\u2019t friendly to wireless signals. Or perhaps the signals from your all-in-one wireless modem and router just can\u2019t reach everywhere from its spot in a far corner of your house. It\u2019s these maladies that mesh systems deal with, a distributed set of smaller WiFi nodes that are spread around your home, pushing internet into every corner. Mesh routers aren\u2019t new, and we\u2019ve reviewed plenty, but now we\u2019re building a one-stop shop for everything you need to know. That\u2019s because WiFi 6E is mature and affordable enough to offer transformative wireless performance for everyone.</p><h2><strong>WiFi</strong></h2><p>WiFi is governed by the International Standard IEEE 802.11, and every few years the standards evolve. Until 2018, routers were sold under their IEEE designation, leaving consumers to deal with the word soup of products labeled 802.11 b/a/g/n/ac et cetera. Mercifully, wiser heads opted to rebrand the standards with numbers: WiFi 4, WiFi 5 and WiFi 6. We\u2019re presently between two WiFi generations, WiFi 6 and 6E, which relates to the frequencies the standard uses. WiFi 6 covers routers which operate on the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, while the latter means it can also use the 6GHz band.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Each WiFi band has tradeoffs, because the slower radio frequencies have greater range but less speed. 2.4GHz signals will travel a long way in your home but aren\u2019t quick, while 6GHz is blisteringly fast, but can be defeated by a sturdy brick wall. A lot of WiFi-enabled gear, like a lot of smart home products, only use 2.4GHz because the range is better and it\u2019s a lot cheaper. But it means that the band is also overcrowded and slow.</p><p>Linksys\u2019 CEO Jonathan Bettino told Engadget why mesh systems are an \u201cadvancement in WiFi technology\u201d over buying a single point router. With one transmitter, the signal can degrade the further away from the router you go, or the local environment isn\u2019t ideal. \u201cYou can have a small [home], but there\u2019s thick walls [...] or things in the way that just interfere with your wireless signal,\u201d he said.</p><p>Historically, the solution to a home\u2019s WiFi dead zone was to buy a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-wifi-extender-130021313.html\">WiFi Range Extender</a> but Bettino said the hardware has both a \u201cterrible user experience\u201d and one of the highest return rates of any consumer electronics product. Mesh WiFi, by comparison, offers \u201cmultiple nodes that can be placed anywhere in your home,\u201d says Bettino, resulting in \u201cubiquitous WiFi\u201d that feels as if you have a \u201crouter in every room.\u201d</p><p>Having a \u201crouter in every room\u201d is the biggest selling point for mesh WiFi given how reliant we all are on the internet. Each node is in constant contact with each other, broadcasting a single, seamless network to all of your devices. There\u2019s no separate network for the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, just a single name that you connect to.</p><h2><strong>What to look for</strong></h2><p>It\u2019s a pretty good time to buy a mesh WiFi system, since WiFi 6E represents a fairly significant leap in the technology. Matt MacPherson, Cisco\u2019s Chief Technology Officer for Wireless, said that WiFi 6E is a substantial \u201cinflection point\u201d and can take advantage of a much broader chunk of the wireless spectrum than its predecessors. \u201cIf you\u2019re using that spectrum with a WiFi 6 [device],\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019re going to get significant gains [in speed.]\u201d</p><p>MacPherson added that WiFi 6E will likely \u201ccarry you for a long time,\u201d thanks to the fact that its \u201ctop throughputs now typically exceed what people can actually connect their home to.\u201d In short, with a top theoretical per-stream speed of 1.2 Gbps, WiFi 6E is fast enough to outrun all but the fastest internet connection. (You may also see talk of WiFi 7 devices, some of which have been released already before the standard is officially launched next year. Given that it will take a generation for all of the devices in your home to be compatible with WiFi 7, it\u2019s not worth thinking about this for several years yet.)</p><h3><strong>Range and speed</strong></h3><p>Every mesh product will boast of its theoretical broadcast range in square feet, as well as its theoretical top speed. Given there are so many factors outside of the manufacturer\u2019s control, these numbers don\u2019t really mean much in the real world. Your internet provider\u2019s real speed, the construction materials and layout of your home, amongst other things, will all affect your WiFi.</p><p>It\u2019s worth saying that raw speed isn\u2019t everything, and that for most normal users, you probably need a lot less than you\u2019re paying for. Netflix <a href=\"https://help.netflix.com/en/node/306\">recommends</a> a minimum speed of just 15 Mbps to stream a 4K video to a single device. Naturally, that\u2019s just for one connection, so you\u2019ll need some more capacity if you\u2019ve got other devices all running at the same time. As cool as it is to say you\u2019ve got 100, 200 or 500 Mbps download speed, factors like latency and reliability are way more crucial.</p><h3><strong>Backhaul</strong></h3><p>Mesh WiFi systems work by connecting every hardware node to a single wireless network, letting them all communicate with each other. Imagine four people in a busy, noisy restaurant all trying to order their dinner from a weary staff member, all at once. Now imagine, while this is going on, that four more people at that same table are also trying to tell a funny anecdote. It\u2019s no surprise that it might take a long while for the right information to reach its intended destination.</p><p>To combat this, higher-end mesh systems offer dedicated wireless backhaul; a slice of the spectrum for node-to-node communication. So rather than everyone talking at once in the same space, the conversations are essentially separated, reducing the invisible clutter in the air. Because there\u2019s less confusing cross-chatter, everything moves faster, offering a significant performance boost to those systems.</p><h3><strong>Connectivity</strong></h3><p>These days, even your washing machine has a wireless connection, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should ignore the joys of wired internet. No matter how fast WiFi is, a hard line will always be faster, and some gear, like Philips\u2019 Hue bridge, still needs an ethernet connection. Plenty of routers can also use these hard connections as backhaul, eliminating further wireless clutter. It\u2019s convenient for spread-out systems and power users, but it will mean running more wires through your home. The most common standard is Cat 5e, or gigabit ethernet which, unsurprisingly, has a top speed of 1 Gigabit per second (Gbps).</p><h3><strong>Flexibility and scalability</strong></h3><p>Mesh enables you to add (or subtract) modules from your network to suit your needs. D-Link\u2019s Alan Jones said users should \u201ccheck how scalable the prospective product is\u201d before you buy. This sense of scale doesn\u2019t just apply to the number of nodes on the network, but how many simultaneous connections it can handle.</p><h3><strong>Placement</strong></h3><p>Modern mesh networking products offer one, two or three (or more) pieces of equipment that are commonly the same hardware inside and out. It normally doesn\u2019t matter which module you make the primary one to connect to your modem, usually over ethernet. You\u2019ll then set up the other, secondary nodes around your home, which is often just a case of adding them to the existing mesh network.</p><p>When installing your hardware, remember that every physical obstacle between nodes may hurt your performance. The ideal spot is, at the very least, at waist height on a piece of furniture without too many obstructions. Tables, sideboards, free-standing cupboards, and bookcases make for a good home. The rule of thumb is to place each node no more than two rooms away from the last one.</p><h2><strong>How we tested</strong></h2><p>My home covers around 2,200 square feet across three stories, with my office on the third floor. It\u2019s relatively long and thin, with the living room at the front of the house, the kitchen at the back and three bedrooms on the second floor. Its age means there are a lot of solid brick walls, old school lathe and plaster, as well as aluminum foil-backed insulation boards to help with energy efficiency. There are two major WiFi dead zones in the house, the bathroom and the bedroom behind it, since there\u2019s lots of old and new pipework in the walls and floors.</p><p>For sets that have two nodes, I placed the first in my living room, connected via ethernet to my cable modem, with the second on the first-floor landing in the (ostensible) center of the house. For three-node sets, the third went in my kitchen, which I\u2019ve found is the optimal layout to get the bulk of my house covered in WiFi.</p><p>Each mesh is judged on ease of setup, coverage, reliability, speed and any additional features. I looked at how user-friendly each companion app is from the perspective of a novice, as well. My tests included checking for dead zones, moving from room to room to measure consistency, and streaming multiple videos at once.</p><h2>The best mesh WiFi systems for 2023</h2><h2><strong>The best mesh WiFi system for most people: TP-Link Deco XE75</strong></h2><p></p><p>There\u2019s no single glitzy feature that sets <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9EZWNvLU1lc2gtV2lmaS02RS1Sb3V0ZXIvZHAvQjA5Vlc1SkhQSC8_dGg9MSZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby0xbTctMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImQ0NGYxODg2LTY1ZWUtNDY2Yy1hN2YwLTA2MGNlMjk5ODVhZSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAYJOdP2vhY_dt7hTdysGv_gz3Z5lJxB00qUul8txiBNl&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDeco-Mesh-Wifi-6E-Router%2Fdp%2FB09VW5JHPH%2F%3Fth%3D1\">TP-Link\u2019s Deco XE75</a> apart from its competition.

Each individual node has the power to cover your home in WiFi, and those extra gigabit and 2.5 Gbps ethernet ports will let you add fast backhaul or a speedy NAS. I\u2019d say that both pro users and gamers will find things to love in this package.

That\u2019ll help you evolve your network in a cost-effective way as you and your home\u2019s needs change over time. Power users will be better-equipped to deal with some of its more idiosyncratic control options, and they\u2019re more likely to take advantage of the 160MHz band support. The upfront cost is pretty expensive, that\u2019s for sure, and it\u2019s certainly not for general users, but it\u2019s a very attractive package for the right person.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-mesh-wifi-system-130028701.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/best-mesh-wifi-system-130028701.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-27 13:05:28+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Insta360's latest tiny action cam comes with a wireless display", "description": "<p>Insta360's thumb-sized <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/insta360-go-2-action-cam-minions-bello-banana-140059750.html\">Go 2</a> action cam already impressed us with its versatility, but it's about to be upstaged by its successor with some surprises.

Not only does this new model offer a longer combined battery life (more on that later), but the Action Pod body also doubles as a 2.2-inch flip touchscreen, meaning you won't need to whip out your phone as often. The whole package is essentially a 2-in-1 action cam and a wireless display.</p><p>The Go 3's camera itself has some significant upgrades as well. Video resolution has been bumped up from 1440p to 2.7k (2,720 x 1,536), meaning you'll get more out of Insta360's renowned \"FlowState\" video stabilization trick. Audio quality has been improved by the addition of a second microphone, thus solving an old pain point. The camera is also certified as waterproof at up to 5 meters deep instead of just 4, but note that the \"Action Pod\" is only IPX4 water resistant, so do not submerge that part under water.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img alt=\"The full Insta360 Go 3 assembly mounted on a selfie stick.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/87003c70-14e5-11ee-bdee-e7ce3fb1d0e3\" style=\"height: 1000px; width: 1600px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Insta360</div></figure><p>The camera's own battery life has been extended from 30 minutes to 45 minutes (1080p@30fps), and when mounted onto the \"Action Pod,\" you'll get up to 170 minutes. The Go 3 also represents an improvement in Insta360's heat dissipation design, so the only limitations on maximum video length are battery life and data storage. Say goodbye to the old 30-minute cap on each clip. This is also probably why the Go 3 comes with a new 128GB flavor, though you may still consider the 64GB or 32GB options to suit your budget.</p><p>In addition to the usual timelapse, \"TimeShift\" (Insta360's take on hyperlapse) and slow motion (up to 4x) features, the Go 3 comes with three new video modes: pre-recording, loop recording and timed capture. Timed capture in particular is handy for setting up auto capture for a sunrise, without you having to wake up to turn on the camera.</p><figure><img alt=\"A dog biting onto a Fetch Stick with a Insta360 Go 3 action cam mounted on the end.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/5d872bb0-14e5-11ee-bdd7-c17b821c4259\" style=\"height: 1000px; width: 1600px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Insta360</div></figure><p>Much like its predecessor, the Go 3 comes with a handful of accessories for various mounting methods. You still get a magnet pendant for first-person point-of-view shots from chest level, though I personally prefer using the included clip mount with a hat to match my eye level. There's also a pivot stand with a reusable sticky base \u2014 the latter can be detached if you want to switch to a 1/4-inch mount instead. If needed, you can buy a quick release mount for action sports, or a monkey tail mount for casual captures anywhere you want. Dog owners may also consider getting the \"Fetch Stick\" to get some goofy close-ups of their pets</p><p>The Insta360 Go 3 is now available via the official online store or <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMEMzVjI3TDZWLz9tYWFzPW1hYXNfYWRnXzRBRTI1QTIzMUY0QTU3MjM0NzhDOUFCMjgzRDkyQTJDX2FmYXBfYWJzJnJlZl89YWFfbWFhcyZtPUEzTENHNU9JUTgyU1FEJnRoPTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMW04LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI5Y2ZjMGExOC1kZDhmLTRkYzYtYjRkYy1iN2ZjNzZhOTYxZmEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWXa5JbbbEvxT9oB2lZGCY3IyCHLnDkteIXQ8dfjMGSM&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0C3V27L6V%2F%3Fmaas%3Dmaas_adg_4AE25A231F4A5723478C9AB283D92A2C_afap_abs%26ref_%3Daa_maas%26m%3DA3LCG5OIQ82SQD%26th%3D1\">Amazon</a>, with the 32GB, 64GB and 128GB models priced at $379.99, $399.99 and $429.99 respectively.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/insta360s-latest-tiny-action-cam-comes-with-a-wireless-display-130001905.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/insta360s-latest-tiny-action-cam-comes-with-a-wireless-display-130001905.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-27 13:00:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "TikTok is jumping off the BeReal bandwagon by killing TikTok Now", "description": "<p>TikTok has told users that it's discontinuing TikTok Now, effectively a clone of last year's social media sensation BeReal, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/27/23775125/tiktok-now-discontinued-notification-bereal-murder-clone\"><em>The Verge</em></a> reported.

That even includes third-party apps like WhatsApp, where you can share images from Google Photos just by dragging and dropping.</p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-fold-review-the-challenger-that-samsung-needs-specs-price-170003458.html\"><figure><img alt=\"TMA\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/befb7e10-14d0-11ee-957b-9c1d4e583ef6\" style=\"height: 405px; width: 675px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Engadget</div></figure></a><p>According to Engadget\u2019s Sam Rutherford, the Pixel Fold\u2019s clever hinge and slim chassis make it easy to use and carry, while its wider body makes the phone's exterior screen much more usable. With better cameras and UI tweaks to make multitasking a tiny bit simpler, the Pixel Fold more than holds its own against Samsung's Z Fold 4. The main challenge: that $1,799 price.

Anyone already on a basic plan doesn't have to worry about being kicked off it, but if they choose to move to another option or close their account, they can't get back on that tier. In Canada, the basic tier is $9.99 (CAD) per month, while the basic tier with ads, launched last year, costs $5.99. Now with the decision to remove its basic option, the streamer is pushing more of its customers towards an ad-filled viewing experience.  It\u2019s making the company money: In the first quarter of 2023, Netflix saw its basic with ads tier bring in more money per user than its standard plan.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/netflix-is-removing-its-basic-plan-in-canada-092535002.html\"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazon-will-use-small-businesses-to-help-deliver-packages-in-the-us-132503498.html\">Amazon will use small businesses to help deliver packages in the US</a></h2><h3>Your local bodega could bring shipments to your door.</h3><h3></h3><p>Amazon is launching a new hub delivery system that uses small businesses in 23 states (including California, New York and Washington) to complete customer shipments.

The Ohio-based EV startup has <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lordstown-motors-announces-strategic-restructuring-process-301863944.html\">filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection</a> in hopes of finding a buyer <em>and </em>is suing its investment partner, Foxconn Technology, for breach of contract and fraud. In its suit, Lordstown claims Foxconn's actions &quot;had the intended effect of destroying the business of an American startup.&quot;</p><p>Foxconn, primarily known for assembling Apple's iPhones, bought Lordstown's Ohio factory in late 2021 (around when <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gm-selling-its-stake-in-troubled-electric-pickup-maker-lordstown-motors-091509553.html\">General Motors jumped ship</a>) and a year later agreed to invest another $170 million through the purchase of common shares and newly created preferred shares. But, in April, Foxconn threatened to terminate the deal, claiming that Lordstown's stock dropping below $1 per share for 30 trading days in a row represented a breach in their agreement. The car manufacturer said the claims had no merit and accused Foxconn of acting in &quot;bad faith&quot; to get control of the factory and its workers without intending to support Endurance, its first pickup EV.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The decision to declare Bankruptcy doesn't exactly come as a surprise \u2014 in May, Lordstown said production would likely stop &quot;<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/lordstown-motors-may-stop-endurance-ev-production-in-the-near-future-180630375.html\">in the near future</a>&quot; and that the company would file if its deal with Foxconn didn't proceed. Lordstown also reported a $171.1 million loss for 2023's first quarter.&nbsp;</p><p>Endurance has also faced <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/lordstown-motors-freezes-production-to-address-quality-issues-210811052.html\">continual problems from production</a> to the final product. Even after Foxconn bought the factory, Lordstown failed to meet its forecasted vehicle production numbers for 2022, cutting it from 500 to 50 trucks. Then came an underperformance in miles, with the Environmental Protection Agency recently rating the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/lordstowns-ev-pickup-has-a-worryingly-short-174-miles-of-epa-range-164714534.html\">pickup's range as just 174 miles</a> versus its promised 250.
