Hello guys and gals, it's me Mutahar again! This time we take a look at a wild story involving my co-host Oompaville who you recognize on the Some Ordinary Podcast. He's been working on a candy machine for over a year and has reached a point where he's been scammed out of a million dollars and almost had his company run into ruins. Caleb always has a smile and digs himself out of any hole and this is a story I'm sure we'll laugh at years from now as he presses on and brings his dream into reality, truly inspiring stuff. Thanks for watching!
