<p>Fiorentina impressed but David Moyes’s side dug deep thanks to their relentless captain who is expected to leave this summer</p><p>Declan Rice could never have dreamed this. Almost a decade after being released as a teenager by Chelsea, West Ham’s captain and talisman has the fairytale ending he so dearly craved.</p><p>Until <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/07/fiorentina-west-ham-europa-conference-league-final-match-report" title="">Jarrod Bowen’s dramatic late winning goal</a> that prompted David Moyes to embark on a David Pleat‑esque jig across the turf at the Eden Arena, winning a first major European trophy since the days of Bobby Moore and company in 1965 had seemed the least likely scenario against Fiorentina. The Italian side dominated possession thanks to the outstanding Sofyan Amrabat despite falling behind to Saïd Benrahma’s penalty. But it is a testament to the spirit Moyes and Rice have created among this group of players that West Ham simply refused to give in. Now they have their reward.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jun/07/declan-rice-delivers-pulsating-final-act-to-push-west-ham-over-the-line">Continue reading...</a>

Off he went, racing down the touchline, only stopping when he was front of the fans behind the Fiorentina goal. The clock showed 90 minutes and Jarrod Bowen, released by a beautiful pass from Lucas Paquetá, had raced through to put West Ham within touching distance of their first trophy in 43 years.</p><p>They were all off the bench when Bowen’s shot slithered past Pietro Terracciano. West Ham had not played well but it made no difference. Moyes had the first trophy of his managerial career. Declan Rice, playing in his final game for the club, had joined Bobby Moore as one of two captains to lead West Ham to a European trophy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/07/fiorentina-west-ham-europa-conference-league-final-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An extract from the 15th anniversary edition of Inverting the Pyramid charts the rise of superclubs and all-powerful players</p><p>Football is dominated now as it never has been before by a handful of superclubs. For many of them, winning their domestic title has come to be regarded almost as a formality. There are vast imbalances within leagues and that, of course, conditions the tactical approach teams take.</p><p>If you expect to win most games comfortably, everything becomes focused on attacking – which can cause problems for the superclubs on the rare occasions they come up against a team at around their level: they forget not merely how to defend, but also how to fight. The standard of defending has declined alarmingly among elite clubs, something that’s not just to do with a shift to a more attacking focus. In the eight seasons of the Champions League from 2009–10, 21 of 104 games in the quarter-finals or later finished with a winning margin of three or more; in the eight seasons before that, there were only eight. Never has a three-goal lead seemed less secure.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/07/jonathan-wilson-inverting-the-pyramid-barcelona-pep-guardiola-manchester-city-cristiano-ronaldo-paul-pogba">Continue reading...</a>

Corporatist language is designed to bleed political rhetoric of all meaning, serving a corporate culture impregnable to changes of government.

Failure to have distinguished itself from the Tories risks early rejection in favour of a charismatic demagogue.

<p>His 2003 play about child torture and freedom of speech became a global phenomenon. But will it offend today’s audiences? The writer-director explains why he won’t be changing a thing</p><p>Iraq had just been invaded and MySpace had just launched, ushering in a new era of hyperlinked horror. That was the world in 2003, when Martin McDonagh’s play The Pillowman premiered at the National Theatre in London. It is a creepy fable of two brothers under interrogation in a totalitarian state for the torture and murder of children. One of the brothers is a writer – and the murders are copycat killings inspired by his stories.</p><p>The critical reception was initially sceptical. McDonagh was in his early 30s and riding a rollercoaster, the author of five rapturously received Irish dramas. The Pillowman was a departure. “I had the feeling that, well, this was an even better play. It was a thing for me to get those crushing reviews,” he says. “It was the first time there was such a disparity between them and what I thought we’d achieved.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/07/martin-mcdonagh-pillowman-lily-allen-child-torture-sean-connery">Continue reading...</a>

## The Groundhogs’ Tony McPhee will remain a hero for the musically adventurous

<p>Influencing Arctic Monkeys to Underworld, with music that spanned blues with John Lee Hooker to avant-garde synth experiments, the late musician was an astonishing British great</p><p>The comic strip cover of the 1972 album Who Will Save the World? The Mighty Groundhogs depicts the trio as a band of superheroes – Powerful Pustelnik, Quick Cruickshank and Marvellous McPhee – battling villains determined to overpopulate and pollute the world. But there’s a sting in the tale. The superheroes are a dismal failure. Limping away from their victorious enemies, they transform into their “secret identities”: a “curiously contrived blues and rock group whose name coincidentally happens to be the Groundhogs”. The final panel thunders: “The rock group Groundhogs might even accomplish more with music than the superhero Groundhogs ever will”, which, given that the superhero Groundhogs have just achieved absolutely nothing, is not saying much.</p><p>The illustration was the work of celebrated Marvel and DC artist Neal Adams, but, with its self-deprecation and understatement, it seems very Tony McPhee, the Groundhogs’ singer and guitarist, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/06/tony-mcphee-singer-and-guitarist-rock-band-the-groundhogs-dies-aged-79">who died on Tuesday</a>. As guitar heroes of the late 60s and early 70s went – and even the most cursory listen to his extraordinarily inventive and powerful playing on Who Will Save the World or its predecessors, Split and Thank Christ for the Bomb, demonstrates how “guitar hero” was a soubriquet McPhee fully deserved – he was remarkably unassuming. Dressed down and resolutely unglamorous, he claimed his second wife had left him because he was “boring”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/07/the-groundhogs-tony-mcphee-tribute">Continue reading...</a>

No longer part of the team, although he could almost certainly do a job if required, even Mark Noble was there, ostensibly in his role as sporting director, but no doubt brought along to ensure that whatever the outcome of Wednesday’s Tin Pot final between West Ham and Fiorentina, at least one of the dressing-rooms in Prague’s Fortuna Arena will be left spick and span with a floor clean enough to eat your pie, mash and jellied eels from.</p><p>Never mind the Saudis helping out Bury or Macclesfield (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/06/football-daily-email-benzema-messi-kante-saudi-coin">yesterday’s Football Daily</a>), how about they add Al-Dershot to their current cluster of clubs?” – Morgan Armstrong.</p><p>The merger of the PGA and DP World golf tours with LIV could be analogous to the Premier League losing washed-up players to the Saudi Pro League and then agreeing to a merger, after the Saudis offered billions upon realising their league couldn’t compete.

## Queer sounds: our writers on their favourite LGBTQ+ songs

<p>For Pride month, Guardian writers have singled out their favourite LGBTQ+ songs, from Pet Shop Boys to Frank Ocean</p><p>Valentine, the second album by the Baltimore indie-rock musician Snail Mail, AKA Lindsey Jordan, is a black hole of anxiety and desperation, a record that revels in the seamy, depressive aftermath of a breakup. Forever (Sailing) is the grand, gorgeous centrepiece of the album, an aching power ballad that finds Jordan singing, over grimy trip-hop production, about a relationship too toxic to last: “So much destruction / Look at what we did / That was so real / And you don’t just forget.” Across Valentine, Jordan rarely lets herself combust like she does on Forever (Sailing) – it’s a huge, dramatic sucker punch, a pop-star turn planted right in the middle of an indie record. Its genesis is a testament to the gay art of dredging up forgotten pop songs: Forever (Sailing)’s chorus is lifted from You and I, a chintzy 70s pop track by the forgotten Swedish diva Madleen Kane. But where the original track is a camp fantasia, Jordan plays it totally straight – finding intense pathos among the chintz. <em>Shaad D’Souza</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/07/guardian-writers-favourite-lgbtq-songs">Continue reading...</a>

## Is eating local produce actually better for the planet?

<p>Think that eating local will help save the planet? Think again. Most emissions come from food production, not transportation</p><p>In June 2005, four women spoke at a San Francisco celebration of the first World Environment Day in North America. The Bay Area locals – Jen Maiser, Jessica Prentice, Sage Van Wing and Dede Sampson – invited the audience to join them in a local food challenge: spending the next month eating only food produced within 100 miles (160km) of their homes.</p><p>Although the concept of eating locally was not new – the farm-to-table movement had kicked off in the 1960s and 70s as hippies protested processed foods and Alice Waters opened the first farm-to-table restaurant, Chez Panisse, in Berkeley, California – these women gave it new life with a new name, calling themselves “locavores”. In his 2006 book, The Omnivore’s Dilemma, Bay Area local Michael Pollan also advocated for the local food movement, and by 2007 the Oxford American Dictionary had dubbed “locavore” its word of the year.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/07/is-eating-local-better-environment">Continue reading...</a>

It’s a film that satirises racism and body-conformism, and 35 years on, it looks more than ever like a left-field riposte – part critical, part supportive – to the extravagant nostalgia of Grease, American Graffiti and TV’s Happy Days.</p><p>Hairspray spawned a stage musical version and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/jul/20/musical.comedy">a remake</a>, but neither had the flavour of this first film. Despite the high production values and relatively family-friendly script, Hairspray has the spirit of provocation in Waters’ early underground movies, a spirit which survives most obviously in the gross-out scene where a spot is burst in gruesome closeup.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/07/hairspray-review-subversive-spirit-shines-through-john-waters-high-camp-80s-musical">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘It’s a risk to put out something completely new’: why pop is so heavily plundering the past

<p>The charts are stuffed with dance-pop songs that brazenly lift from 90s hits. Is this a clever blend of nostalgia and freshness – or a sign the industry has run out of ideas?</p><p>Pop has always eaten itself, but its appetite for nostalgia has become more voracious than ever – particularly for the dance music of the 90s and 00s. There are now numerous singles that reference the era (most often with interpolation, the reusing of a lyric or melodic phrase) in the UK chart: Switch Disco and Ella Henderson’s React – likely rising into the Top 3 this week – samples Robert Miles’ trance classic Children, David Guetta’s Baby Don’t Hurt Me flips Haddaway’s immortal What Is Love, Kim Petras and Nicki Minaj’s Alone recycles the hook of Alice Deejay’s Better Off Alone, and Denham Audio has had a longstanding hit with a version of Strike’s U Sure Do. All of them hark back to an era of bright uncomplicated melodies, big melancholic chords, and messy nights out that went mercifully undocumented on social media.</p><p>Jack Melhuish – who, until Warner’s recent layoffs, served as general manager of Parlophone Records UK – says the tipping point for the craze came last year, when David Guetta and Bebe Rexha released I’m Good (Blue), which interpolated Eiffel 65’s Blue (Da Ba Dee) and later hit No 1 on the UK charts. “It wasn’t the first, but in terms of the scale of it, you’d be hard-pressed to find a 90s pop-dance sample that was as flagrant and as blatant as that,” he says. “After that record came out, there was a slight change from the producer and artist community, like: OK, now we can really go for this.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/07/its-a-risk-to-put-out-something-completely-new-why-pop-is-so-heavily-plundering-the-past">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Four years after my husband’s death, the question of where to locate my grief still isn’t easy to answer</p><p>If you could drop a pin on the map of your grief, where would you travel to? In the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/17/kat-lister-turning-the-anger-of-grief-into-comedy">early days</a> of mine, I would have motioned you to the toilet in my bathroom where I heaved on my knees, again and again, into the bowl below. Six months later, I would have swapped that room’s lino flooring for grass, walking you down to the banks of the River Thames. We’d head to the bend in the water where I scattered my husband’s ashes in a boat, marvelling at the patterns he made, watching him spiral and swirl.</p><p>These days, four years on from his death, the question of “where” to locate my grief isn’t an easy one to answer. There isn’t a cursor to follow, nor is there a grid reference to share. I suspect that this ambiguity, at least in part, reflects the intangible quality of the water in which I released his ashes. For many years, I pondered whether a headstone would have given me the sense of stability I so desperately craved. The regular pilgrimage to a rooted headstone can give a sense of direction and sanctuary to many people in their grief. A visible conduit between two disparate worlds. But, as time goes on, the distance between “then” and “now” widens – and with it, my own understanding of what transience and permanence actually mean.</p><p>Kat Lister is the author of The Elements: A Widowhood</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/07/lost-loved-one-shrines-past-grief">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Kelvin Harrison Jr plays the Caribbean-born maestro, once declared ‘the most accomplished man in Europe’, who takes on Mozart in a duel-by-violin</p><p>Period drama’s narrow focus on telling and re-telling the same stories has, historically at least, deprived audiences of some rip-roaring screen fare. That’s now changing, as evidenced by this film about 18th-century Parisian polymath Joseph Bologne AKA Chevalier de Saint-Georges. As played by Kelvin Harrison Jr, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/19/chevalier-film-joseph-bologne-true-story">this fascinating fellow</a> escaped a Caribbean slave plantation – his mother was a Senegalese-African woman; his father her enslaver – to reach the highest echelons of French society. There he excelled as a champion fencer, composer and virtuoso violinist, described by US founding father John Adams as “the most accomplished man in Europe”.</p><p>Screenwriter Stefani Robinson and director Stephen Williams have now brought his story to the screen, beginning with an impressive scene in which Bologne upstages Mozart at his own concert by challenging him to a musical duel: F Murray Abraham’s Salieri would have loved to see it! Their weapon is the violin, but the most essential element in Bologne’s armoury – and perhaps that of any Black artist – is his unassailable self-confidence. That genuine talent is the basis for this, and it is also persuasively demonstrated in the on-camera arrangements by Michael Abels, which incorporate Bologne’s own concertos with some interesting speculation on the musical influence of his Afro-Caribbean heritage.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/07/chevalier-review-neglected-18th-century-black-virtuoso-finally-gets-his-due">Continue reading...</a>

## Do you have a ‘salt tooth’? How to recognise it – and feed your cravings healthily

<p>We all know what a sweet tooth is, but some people also hanker for salt. Here’s what to do if you can’t stop dreaming of crisps</p><p>Is there any such thing as a “salt tooth”? We are familiar with a sweet tooth, and sugar cravings, along with the negative effects of those. We are broadly aware of the downsides of too much salt, including high blood pressure, which puts pressure on the blood vessels, the heart and the kidneys. It can also lead to water retention. The British Heart Foundation <a href="https://www.bhf.org.uk/-/media/files/what-we-do/influencing-change/healthlumensalt2022/bhf-salt-report-22.pdf?rev=04e38b527bd544e1b94aef7fbf767da2&amp;hash=0E6FC5772972EE976CDD854CA34892DD">concluded last year</a> that if everyone brought their consumption down to the World Health Organization salt limit of 5g a day by 2030, the result would be up to 1.4m fewer new cases of high blood pressure, 135,000 fewer new cases of coronary heart disease, up to 49,000 fewer new cases of stroke and more than 450,000 extra years in good health.</p><p>But salt is not considered a dietary luxury, even though 40% of people, <a href="https://www.bhf.org.uk/what-we-do/news-from-the-bhf/news-archive/2023/may/four-in-five-dont-know-recommended-maximum-daily-salt-intake">according to a YouGov poll</a>, would put crisps way above chocolate in the treat hierarchy. We don’t tend to police how much we eat – at least, not as rigorously as with sugar – or question whether we are innocently listening to our bodies, which need some salt for basic muscle function, or are in the grip of a compulsion.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/07/do-you-have-a-salt-tooth-how-to-recognise-it-and-feed-your-cravings-healthily">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A Hammers fan who grew used to cup finals traces decades of misery that have led to the Europa Conference League final</p><p>West Ham are in their first European final for 47 years. Back in 1976 I was a 16-year-old on a rainy night at Upton Park watching the Irons beat Eintracht Frankfurt 3-1 to reach the European Cup Winners’ Cup final. For the winning goal Trevor Brooking threw a dummy that sent a defender halfway down the Barking Road.</p><p>We lost the final 4-2 to Anderlecht, but it didn’t matter too much. I saw West Ham win the FA Cup at Wembley in 1975 and again in 1980. The Hammers reached the League Cup final in 1981. Surely finals would come round every few years? But then came the 43 years of hurt since we last won a trophy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/07/west-ham-winning-trophies-43-years-of-hurt-europa-conference-league-final-fiorentina">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Access to family papers sheds new light on the troubled singer-songwriter</p><p>“Do you curse where you come from?” Nick Drake asks an imagined lover in his 1971 song Hazey Jane I. This first comprehensive account of the revered singer-songwriter’s short life makes it clear that he did. It uses previously unseen family papers to illuminate Drake’s final years, in which, despairing at his apparent failure as a musician, he withdrew to his detested childhood home in Tanworth-in-Arden.</p><p>Towards the end of his life, Drake was pulled between two places he felt damaged him in contrasting ways. London, the hub of his musical career, was overwhelming; his family’s comfortable home in rural Warwickshire was safe but stultifying. “There’s no outlet to say what I think about this bloody place!” he told his mother and bemoaned that in Britain, unlike the US, people could never “break away from their background”. This meticulous and ultimately heartbreaking biography is the story of a man who believed he’d “failed in every single thing I’ve ever tried to do”. It’s true that a quarter of a century after his death he would become famous for his music; but also as an archetype of the doomed artist whose only acclaim is posthumous.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/07/nick-drake-by-richard-morton-jack-review-genius-remembered">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When Utah’s Republican lawmakers decided to clamp down on ‘pornographic or indecent’ texts, they won’t have had the Old Testament in mind</p><p>When I was a teenager, I read Genesis for the first and only time. It was quite the revelation. Excuse me, I would say with teenage zeal, to anyone who would listen, <a href="https://artuk.org/discover/stories/lot-and-his-daughters-a-troubling-tale-of-sin-and-seduction">do you know about Lot</a>? Do you know that his two daughters conspired to get him drunk and then they undressed him and had sex with him in order to continue the family line? This was after God turned Lot’s wife into a pillar of salt, by the way, and there was an attempted gang-rape involving angels. Oh, and this isn’t a one-off, you know. Noah – the animal rescue enthusiast – also got drunk and naked. And there was some weird business with his son, Ham. I don’t mean to be disrespectful, but there is some messed-up stuff in the Bible.</p><p>An anonymous parent in the US agrees. A Utah school district recently removed the King James Bible from school libraries for containing <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65794363">“vulgarity or violence”</a>. Last year, you see, amid an orgy of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/20/book-bans-us-public-schools-increase-pen-america">conservative book-banning</a>, Utah’s Republican legislators passed a law that allowed any parent to file a challenge about a book in a public school they considered “<a href="https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/editorial/2023/06/02/tribune-editorial-bible-is-banned/">pornographic or indecent</a>”. Of course, nobody wants pornography or indecent materials in schools, but this law has been wielded in bad faith to get rid of anything related to LGBTQ+ people or racial identity.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/07/book-bans-are-sweeping-us-schools-a-surprising-new-victim-the-bible">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I’m a pensioner who has lived here since the estate was built in 1977, but now I’m having to pay an extra £76 a week</p><p><strong>I am a 77-year-old pensioner who has been a tenant of Lambeth council in London since my estate was built in 1977. We brought up our family here, and my husband died here, but I feel I am being priced out of my home by a 350% increase in the communal heating and hot water charges the council is applying. Coupled with the rise in rent and service charges, it means I’m having to pay an extra £76 a week. The heating and hot water charges have to be paid all year, and there is no way to economise because we pay the same, however much or little we use.<br /></strong><em><strong>LF, London</strong></em></p><p>In March, you and countless other council tenants across the London borough of Lambeth were given four weeks notice of a 58% increase in weekly rent and service charges. This included an eye-watering rise in the costs of your heating and hot water, provided from a central generator by a district heat network. Your weekly heating bill soared from £13.69 to £61.99 and the hot water from £4.76 to £21.56. On top of that, you have to pay separately for electricity and cooking gas. The letter, from the Labour-run council, helpfully told residents unable to afford the rises they could avoid them by ending their tenancy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jun/07/i-fear-im-being-priced-out-of-my-home-by-lambeths-350-energy-price-rise">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Central American country has incredible wildlife and biodiversity. Our writer explores its forest and meets the Indigenous people hoping to preserve it</p><p>Suddenly the road loses the plot. Deep holes spread like a rash, then become pits that expand into missing sections filled with rainwater. An old man on a mule saunters past, unsmiling. The landscape remains the same: rolling ranching land dotted with clumps of jungle, banana and bamboo, though the houses are smaller, and poorer. The neatly painted homes of earlier in the day give way to wooden shacks. Chickens, dogs and children scratch around them. Under a thatched roof someone dozes in a gently swaying hammock. The car drops a wheel into a hole with a sickening crunch.</p><p>Panama is a neighbour to Costa Rica, and the two countries share many features, including some of the most biodiverse forests on Earth. According to <a href="https://www.fao.org/3/ca9825en/CA9825EN.pdf">UN figures</a>, Panama has about 4.2m hectares of forest, Costa Rica 3m hectares. However, stepping across the border a few days earlier, I was immediately made aware of differences. Panama seems sharper. There’s more traffic on the Pan-American Highway, garish adverts in the towns, and US-style shopping malls. Signs of consumer wealth, however, are matched by those of poverty. Now I am seeing another difference: Panama has more Indigenous people – almost half a million from a total population of about 4.3 million – and one of the trunk roads into their main rural area is disintegrating in front of us. Eventually, we pull up outside our destination and a young capuchin monkey runs out, vaults up my leg and nips me on the arm. It doesn’t draw blood, but it’s not much of a welcome.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/jun/07/i-feel-the-wing-draught-of-dozens-of-hummingbirds-the-wild-beauty-of-panama">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Arguments over the green credentials of electric cars are already over. Work on 21st-century tech, and leave the past behind</p><ul><li>Ben Lane is co-founder and CTO at Zapmap, a UK-wide map of electric car charging points</li></ul><p>It should by now be clear to all vehicle manufacturers and policymakers that the electric vehicle (EV) age is all but inevitable. Most drivers already get it, as shown by the huge order books for most electric models. The long-running fight over whether electric or petrol/diesel engines generate more emissions during their lifecycle, further fuelled by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/03/electric-vehicles-early-adopter-petrol-car-ev-environment-rowan-atkinson">Rowan Atkinson’s recent intervention</a>, is in fact all but over. After years of crunching the numbers, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-020-0488-7">peer-reviewed studies</a> consistently arrive at the same <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/3/1241/htm">conclusion</a>: EVs win. The UK government’s own research supports this position and <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1154612/zev-mandate-cost-benefit-analysis.pdf">concludes</a> that transitioning to zero-emission vehicles would “significantly” reduce overall carbon use.</p><p>Of course, where the vehicle and battery are manufactured, and how the electricity is generated, make a difference to the carbon benefits of EVs. But helpful and accessible tools such as the Transport &amp; Environment campaign’s <a href="https://www.transportenvironment.org/discover/how-clean-are-electric-cars/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw7PCjBhDwARIsANo7CgkZlwbCdlP7yMOFKlYwm90VqQRAU4evR1fZeUETaxaz-4CFcZmW7dAaAncSEALw_wcB">How clean are electric cars?</a> calculator are doing much to demystify these concerns for the average person. This tool clearly shows that across its whole lifetime, a small EV driven in Sweden using a battery produced there emits 83% less than a similar petrol car – that’s a huge improvement. Even one driven in Poland with a battery made in China still emits 37% less.</p><p>Ben Lane is co-founder and CTO at Zapmap, a UK-wide map of electric car charging points</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/07/petrol-diesel-engines-technology-electric-cars">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An agoraphobic downloads an app that promises to turn his life around – but things begin to get sinister when it takes over his social interactions</p><p>This disturbingly real-looking artificial intelligence sci-fi was made a couple of years ago on what looks like a budget of small change tipped out of the film-makers’ coin jars. It’s getting a release now presumably on account of AI anxiety creeping up the league table of things that keep people awake at night. Like the Nosedive episode of Charlie Brooker’s Black Mirror, the premise here is that in an apparently-near future people wear contact lenses that feed them information about the world. (Actually, the film is an extended version of a short made by its directors Daniel Lazo and Eran May-Raz back in 2012.)</p><p>Andrew Riddell plays Patrick, who like everyone else wears dazzling blue contact lenses that fill the air around him with holograms. Patrick is an agoraphobic who hasn’t left his apartment for over a month; he spends his time playing computer games, going hammer and tongs with 3D zombies. Saviour comes in the form of an app, Refresh, that promises to turn Patrick’s life around. And it delivers, starting with a spring clean of his apartment. The app turns dull chores into computer games; picking laundry off the floor becomes a basketball game – slam dunk the shirt into the basket, and so get a little dopamine hit. Refresh chooses Patrick a new wardrobe of clothes (ordered to arrive by drone in 30 minutes). Things begin to get sinister when it feeds him lines to speak in social interactions, like making small talk with a barber.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/07/sight-extended-review-unsettling-tale-is-an-eye-opener-in-our-age-of-ai-anxiety">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I saved money, embraced my neighbourhood and met some kind people. All while feeling good about doing my bit for the environment</p><p>After our rustbucket of a VW Polo was towed away from outside Marks &amp; Spencer, I rang the car pound to ask how much it would cost to get it out. “It will be £250, sir,” said the man. “But it’s only worth £50,” I replied. He clearly thought I might have difficulty coming up with £250 because he added kindly: “A lot of people find that a challenging sum. But there’s no shame in it.” Absolutely, but that wasn’t the issue. “Can I ring you back?

What percentage of CBI members voted in the poll?</p><p>That is the point at which the “voice of business” falls silent.

You’d be wrong …</p><p>If you come at the king, as they say, you’d better not miss. In much the same way, in the current TV landscape, if you come with a multi-part drama about a mysterious death at a luxury resort that is more an interrogation of racial inequality, privilege and class than it is a murder-mystery, you’d better be as good as The White Lotus.</p><p>Saint X tries. The new series, adapted from Alexis Schaitkin’s 2020 novel of the same name by Leila Gerstein, has two timelines (plus flashbacks). One is in 2005 on an Aruba-like island in the Caribbean, which in the space of a generation has become a tourist destination. The latest batch of (affluent, almost all white) visitors to Indigo Bay resort include the Thomas family. It comprises 18-year-old soon-to-be-Princeton-student Alison (West Duchovny – yes, daughter of) who, when not railing at her parents for not appreciating the injustice the world, is busy enjoying the freshly squeezed fruit cocktails of their labour by the pool. Blessed be the young folk in which hyper- and hypocriticism so seamlessly blend. But she adores her younger sister Claire, a shy, anxious child, and is idolised by her in turn. Her parents – Michael Park as dad, Betsy Brandt as mum – are saints for dealing with her but in all other respects are complacent monied white folks who made their compromises with life long ago and are quite happy with them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/07/saint-x-review-like-the-white-lotus-but-much-much-worse">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sam Altman, the founder of the revolutionary application Chat-GPT, is touring Europe with a message: AI is changing the world and there are big risks, but also big potential rewards</p><p>In a recent episode, the Guardian’s UK technology editor, <strong>Alex Hern</strong>, brought us an eye-opening conversation with Geoffrey Hinton, often known as the godfather of artificial intelligence. He raised the alarm that the technology was in danger of evolving faster than our ability to control it, to the extent it could become an existential threat.</p><p>Now Hern is back to present the other side of the growing debate on AI and to describe an encounter with another of the field’s leading thinkers, <strong>Sam Altman</strong>. He tells <strong>Michael Safi </strong>that Altman and Hinton agreed on one thing: AI could pose an enormous risk to the world. But from there they diverge – Altman believes those risks can be managed, regulated and ultimately harnessed towards a future where the health, education and societal benefits of artificial intelligence are truly transformative.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/jun/07/how-to-develop-artificial-super-intelligence-without-destroying-humanity">Continue reading...</a>
