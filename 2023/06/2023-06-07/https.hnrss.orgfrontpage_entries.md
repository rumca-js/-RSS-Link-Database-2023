## Show HN: I built an AI language teacher to get you speaking
 - [https://gliglish.com/](https://gliglish.com/)

<p>Hello Hacker News,<p>When learning foreign languages, I made the most progress by speaking them throughout the day, every day. So I made a site where you can *speak* to an AI language teacher to practice both listening and speaking.<p># The product<p>*What I have now:*<p>* Multilingual speech recognition: You can ask a question in English and get an answer in your target language.
* Feedback on your grammar.
* Suggestions: See examples of what to say next to keep the conversation flowing.
* Speed: Choose a lower speed for beginners or a faster one for advanced levels.
* Translations: Click to see a translation into English (or another language).
* Role-playing: Practice real-life situations.
* Available to learn American English, British English, Australian English, French, Spanish from Spain, Spanish from Mexico, Brazilian Portuguese, European Portuguese, Russian, and more.<p>*What I'd like to add:*<p>* More Situations/Characters/Customizations: A "Creator mode".
* Feedback on your pronunciation.
* Text-based responses (Type or click ‚Äì would feel like a "Create Your Own Adventure" book!)
* A dictionary.
* Phonetics: Zoom in and repeat a sound to help you hear phonemes and words more clearly.
* ‚Ä¶and so much more!‚Ä¶<p># The startup<p>Been working on this for 6-7 months now.<p>I love this project and got lots of laudatory comments about it, but still find it hard to make it take off. 31% of people come back to it, traffic is growing through word of mouth with language teachers in schools or Telegram or private intranets sharing it with others. So that's nice. But nice words alone don't pay the bills.<p>My goal is to achieve enough growth to cover costs, which would then allow me to focus 100% on the product (currently it's more like 50% of my time). But I'm not there yet.<p>A challenge I see is that most places forbid self-promotion. So I'm just not sure how on Earth I'm supposed to have a product take off. I could pay for ads, but I use AdBlock everywhere so this feels out of character. I'm a big fan of Pieter Levels (@levelsio on Twitter) because he's doing things solo, so I'm trying to emulate the same kind of success. But it seems that something is missing.<p>What features would you find most useful? How can I better market this without resorting to ads?<p>Thanks for reading!  If you've got thoughts or ideas, I would love to hear them.<p>Cheers,
Fabien</p>

## Painful Lesson: Always 'Show and Tell' Your Product Before You Develop It

<p>It's said that amazon asks their product makers to write a press release about the release of the product and work backwards from there.<p>Working backwards has its uses...<p>I recently wanted validation on a product I had already finished developing<p>I thought I needed it so others will too. I put in a lot of time architecting it, designing it with careful UX and UI.<p>When it came time to show and tell through a demo video i couldn't create a simple enough one that explains what it does.<p>So anyway I posted it in some communities and people we just confused and nobody signed up.<p>So I had to abandon the project as there were no takers<p>Cut to about a week back where I had another idea... This time instead of simply developing it further, I jumped straight to see if I can create a explainer video of the product. So with zero expectations about it working I made one without audio or music or even subtitles and posted on reddit.  It was just a screen recording of it working on my laptop.<p>To my surprise people wanted it. Some even demanding it. I quickly put up a "coming soon" website to capture emails. 36 people gave their emails! Many more I could message on reddit once I am ready.<p>Here is the link to the reddit post...
https://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/comments/13xm1s5/i_made_this_seo_keyword_searching_thingie_for_my/<p>here is what I wrote...<p>-------
Headline: I made this SEO keyword searching thingie for my own needs... Does anyone want it? Its very ugly at the moment<p>Description: Lets say you want to rank high on Google for the keyword "pet dog care"<p>Before you write any content, you want to know what questions people ask on Google, Who is ranking on the top 10 and what other keywords do they rank for?, and 'Google Suggestions' for the phrase.<p>So I made one and I find it damn bloody useful when creating highly relevant and SEO potimised content. Wonder if anyone else finds this stuff useful.<p>I have been burnt building unnecessary stuff before so I am very careful to validate first now. I will only develop this further is there is any interest here :-)
-------<p>The ugly video I shared... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-873SkJ2RI<p>link to the coming soon page... https://keywordranking.me/<p>Now I am developing the product into something others could use in collaboration with actual users and i have to do it fast since so many are waiting. This is a first for me. This is probably what product Market fit feels like... probably.</p>

## Show HN: Castled Data ‚Äì Customer engagement software on top of data warehouses
 - [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36226883](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36226883)

<p>Hi HN, We're Frank, Abhilash, and Arun from Castled Data(<a href="https://castled.io">https://castled.io</a>). Castled is a Customer Engagement platform built directly on top of cloud data warehouses like Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, and Postgres.<p>In essence, Castled is identical to Braze and Iterable with a crucial difference - we don't keep a copy of your customer data. Instead, we enable marketers to create audiences directly on their cloud data warehouse and engage them across channels like Email, Sms, WhatsApp, Push, and In-app notifications - no SQL knowledge, no engineering favours required.<p>Here is a quick demo:
<a href="https://www.loom.com/share/217a31ac47de451992573b1b37c1b8e5" rel="nofollow">https://www.loom.com/share/217a31ac47de451992573b1b37c1b8e5</a><p>We started our journey by building an open-source Reverse ETL solution to make warehouse data actionable to marketers. However, after talking to 100s of marketers, we realised that modern B2C marketers needed to leverage billions of customer data points from the data warehouse to run personalised marketing campaigns. While Reverse ETL could sync all this data to marketing tools like Braze, Iterable, etc., the traditional marketing solutions were fundamentally not designed to store and process so much data.<p>That's when we changed course to build a warehouse-first customer engagement solution. With Castled, marketers could finally use "all" the data from their data warehouse to engage their customers without any tradeoffs.<p>Customer Engagement platforms have historically been built on top of transactional databases. So, solving the same use cases on top of a data warehouse optimised for analytical workloads was a significant challenge. But fortunately, B2C marketing use cases primarily warranted bulk data access, which data warehouses were uniquely designed to solve. The architectural change also enabled us to offer capabilities that were impossible with traditional solutions.<p>As Castled is a "headless" platform - meaning we don't store any customer data - we offer a pricing model based solely on the number of team members using our platform, not the volume of data processed. The approach allowed our customers to focus on marketing efficiency without worrying about the fluctuating costs associated with data usage.<p>We have been building Castled for more than a year and have enabled many businesses to overcome the data limitations of existing marketing platforms. If you have a data problem in marketing, feel free to sign up and try our product for free - no credit card required. We have our solution hosted at <a href="https://castled.io">https://castled.io</a>.<p>We have been avid followers of HN for years now. So we look forward to your thoughts, insights, questions, and concerns about our product in the comments below. I will monitor the thread throughout the day to answer questions from the community. Also, feel free to reach out to me personally at arun@castled.io.</p>

## Launch HN: Fastgen (YC W23) ‚Äì Visual Low-Code Backend Builder

<p>Hi HN! I‚Äôm Constantin and together with my co-founders David and Mike we‚Äôre building Fastgen, a low code API and workflow builder with an integrated Postgres DB. You can use it to quickly build any custom business logic, cron jobs or complete backends.<p>We just launched our public beta, you can try it out here: <a href="https://fastgen.com/">https://fastgen.com/</a>. You can find demo videos <a href="https://youtu.be/O9IM7rLYIQU" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/O9IM7rLYIQU</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/Hc1CYJDEDQw" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/Hc1CYJDEDQw</a>.<p>At our previous company, a student financing platform, we built several internal and external facing tools and encountered how tedious it can be to create and maintain myriads of APIs/CRUD operations. We especially felt that when building for edge cases and ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù scenarios, as well as integrating with lots of third party services which receive, update and return data. In our case, a custom servicing platform which handled student repayments had to account for different student categories and repayment plans, while factoring in data we received from our KYC and ACH banking partners for each student. With Fastgen we try to eliminate boilerplate code and make it easier to adjust and share your work in a visual environment.<p>We‚Äôre low-code fans ourselves and believe it‚Äôs sometimes underappreciated how much complexity existing solutions can already handle, and we are excited to contribute to that market. The low-code space is crowded with front-end tools, but with a comparatively small number of backend tools. There is lots of busywork that comes with setting up a backend; we remove that busywork. Also, most low-code tools restrict users in what they are able to do. Our goal is to provide you with the flexibility and control inherent in coding, while still making it easier to use and faster to deploy.<p>In Fastgen you sequence 'actions' to form rest APIs and workflows through a drag-and-drop interface. Actions are essentially functions that perform specific tasks such as sending an HTTP request, checking for conditions or interacting with a database.<p>We support SQL for database operations, JSON for data structure, and comparison operators similar to JavaScript for decision-making in workflows. Everything you create can be deployed and tested instantly in the platform and will be hosted for you. Fastgen has a 'Debug Mode' that gives insights into the step-by-step execution of workflows. This aids in pinpointing issues and optimizing workflow performance.<p>While some users have created backends for full MVPs with us, others use the platform to build automations for their data/operations teams. For example, one team was missing functionality in Pipedrive for their sales team, so they created a sequence of conditions and HTTP requests to the Pipedrive API to create their own custom lead recycling process.<p>Other things our users have done include the creation of KYC onboarding flows, a Chinese translation app using ChatGPT, an API that retrieves a company‚Äôs financial filings from the SEC for a crowdfunding platform, a cron job that checks for the health status of all other APIs in a code base, a categorizer of well performing product launches, a sitemap checker for a SEO project, and others.<p>We would love for you to try out the platform and are excited for your thoughts and feedback in the comments!</p>

<p>Code review helps discover programming errors in software engineering. Would requiring paper author's to submit reproducible, or at least reviewable, code for generating their results have the same effect on academic research?<p>How much of the 'crisis of reproducibility' is caused by code that wouldn't pass the smell test, let alone a real code review?</p>
