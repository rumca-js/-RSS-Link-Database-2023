<p>It&rsquo;s finally time to bling out your PC! Microsoft has begun testing its Dynamic Lighting feature for the PC&rsquo;s RGB hardware, as well as a prettier File Explorer and updated emoji.</p>



<p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/06/07/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-23475/&amp;xcust=2-1-1946089-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Windows 11 Insider Preview build 23475</a> for the Dev Channel adds support for the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1928248/dynamic-lighting-will-be-windows-tool-to-manage-your-pcs-bling.html">Dynamic Lighting feature</a> that Microsoft recently announced, which attempts to unify the various utilities for controlling the RGB hardware made by different manufacturers inside a common interface. Several device manufacturers including Acer, Asus, HP, HyperX, Logitech, Razer, and Twinkly have partnered with Microsoft on Dynamic Lighting, Microsoft said.</p>



<p>Right now, though, the list of potentially compatible devices is small: basically a variety of Razer peripherals and not much else. Microsoft also indicated that even those peripherals have yet to be formally verified for compatibility, so there&rsquo;s no guarantee they will work. (Scroll down to the bottom of this post for a full list.) The fact that there is now a single point of control within Windows for RGB peripherals and components, though, is exciting; to date, RGB lighting controls have largely been handled by a variety of manufacturer-specific utility apps plus some more generic utilities.</p>



<p>If you have one of the approved peripherals and the new build, you can find the Dynamic Lighting controls within the Windows Settings list, specifically the <em>Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Dynamic Lighting</em> menu. There&rsquo;s an additional caveat: Because of the new code&rsquo;s instability, Microsoft recommends that you use wired, rather than wireless, peripherals.</p>

<p>Though Dynamic Lighting is certainly the flagship feature of this build, there&rsquo;s a nice change arriving in File Explorer, too. The default file manager within Windows will add a carousel view as well as better insights into how much storage remains within your OneDrive subscription.</p>



<p>Microsoft has tweaked File Explorer before, ensuring that you see how much storage you have in the cloud, and how much more you potentially need to buy.</p>

<p>Microsoft is also adding support for Unicode Emoji 15, which will tweak Microsoft&rsquo;s emoji. </p>



<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s latest build does fall under the Dev Channel, which means that there&rsquo;s no guarantee that it will come to market until it hits the Beta Channel or the Release Preview Channel. Still, given the significance of the new features, we&rsquo;d expect them to push through into the Beta Channel before long.</p>



<p>Microsoft provided a list of Dynamic Lighting-compatible hardware that was current as of press time.

## This LG portable monitor lives inside a stylish briefcase

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>&ldquo;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1787210/best-portable-monitors.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Portable monitor</a>&rdquo; usually refers to a small, secondary screen, plugged into a laptop to expand its multi-tasking capabilities on the road. LG has something different in mind with the Standby Me Go. (Yes, that&rsquo;s the real name). It&rsquo;s definitely portable, in that it lives in an old-fashioned suitcase and folds out in a stylish display. But this gadget is more of an all-in-one entertainment center. While it&rsquo;s possible to use it as a monitor or TV, it can also serve up streaming content or touchscreen games all on its own. </p>



<p>The Standby Me Go (spotted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/lgs-28-lb-stanbyme-go-combines-a-27-inch-tablet-with-a-rugged-briefcase/amp/&amp;xcust=2-1-1945788-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ars Technica</a>) is a little 27-inch LG smart TV, complete with the company&rsquo;s WebOS TV software and four internal speakers with 40 watts of output. The screen is only 1080p, but that&rsquo;s understandable given the size. The whole package folds down into a stylish briefcase, which can open up and display the screen in horizontal or vertical mode or even lay flat for head-to-head games. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="LG Standbyme go portable monitor GIF" class="wp-image-1945824" height="480" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/%EC%A0%9C%ED%92%88%EC%98%81%EC%83%81-LG-%EC%8A%A4%ED%83%A0%EB%B0%94%EC%9D%B4%EB%AF%B8-Go-2.gif" width="854" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">LG</p></div>



<p>It can run for up to three hours on its internal battery, stream content via Wi-Fi, load it up directly via USB, or cast it from a nearby smartphone. (A neat trick is that when laid flat and streaming music, the screen displays a record player animation). And, if all else fails, you can plug in whatever you want via HDMI. It comes with a handy remote, which gets a dedicated slot in the case. </p>



<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting spin on the idea for sure, but this is definitely a case (sorry) of style over substance. The 27-inch-wide, 4.6-inch-thick case <em>does </em>look incredibly slick, like a thin modern hard-sided piece of luxury luggage. But aside from its ability to be used untethered for a short time, there&rsquo;s not much you can do with this design that wouldn&rsquo;t be possible with a small smart TV, which can be had for $200 or so from many electronics stores. </p>



<p>So, how much does LG want for the Standby Me Go? <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.lge.co.kr/tvs/27lx5qkna&amp;xcust=2-1-1945788-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The listing on its Korean store</a> starts at 1.19 million won, which at today&rsquo;s exchange rate is about $920 USD. Whether that&rsquo;s worth it is up to you, or at least it might be, if LG ever decides to sell this thing internationally. </p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no better way to sweeten the deal of a new graphics card than by throwing in a recent high-end game to test it out. AMD&rsquo;s latest free game promotion includes <em>Resident Evil 4 Remake</em>, one of the best-received games of the year so far. Digital codes are now being bundled with purchases of new Radeon RX 6000 and RX 7000-series cards and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amd.com/en/campaigns/game-on&amp;xcust=2-1-1945633-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">will be available until July 1st</a>. </p>



<p>The full list of desktop GPUs (including reference cards made by OEMs like Sapphire and MSI) and Radeon-equipped laptops that qualify for the free game code are as follows: </p>



<ul><li>AMD Radeon&trade; RX 7900 XTX</li><li>AMD Radeon&trade; RX 7900 XT</li><li>AMD Radeon&trade; RX 7700S</li><li>AMD Radeon&trade; RX 7600S</li><li>AMD Radeon&trade; RX 7600M XT</li><li>AMD Radeon&trade; RX 7600</li><li>AMD Radeon&trade; RX 6950 XT</li><li>AMD Radeon&trade; RX 6900 XT</li><li>AMD Radeon&trade; RX 6800 XT</li><li>AMD Radeon&trade; RX 6850M XT</li><li>AMD Radeon&trade; RX 6800S</li><li>AMD Radeon&trade; RX 6800</li><li>AMD Radeon&trade; RX 6750 XT</li><li>AMD Radeon&trade; RX 6700 XT</li><li>AMD Radeon&trade; RX 6700</li><li>AMD Radeon&trade; RX 6700M</li><li>AMD Radeon&trade; RX 6650 XT</li><li>AMD Radeon&trade; RX 6600S</li></ul>



<p><em>Resident Evil 4</em> was originally released way back in 2005 for the Nintendo Gamecube. Despite being part of the long-running franchise, it was considered groundbreaking, both for revitalizing the stagnant series and transitioning the horror game&rsquo;s fixed camera gameplay to full 3D. You can see <em>RE4</em>&lsquo;s influence in action and shooting games to this day, in everything from <em>Gears of War </em>to <em>Fortnite. </em>The 2023 remake has been praised for its visual fidelity and improved systems, though some of the original&rsquo;s campy flavor has been removed in the remake. </p>



<p>Free codes should be included in the purchase from most online retailers, but you might have to do a little registration legwork if you buy a new GPU or laptop in a brick-and-mortar store. For those making major upgrades or building a full gaming PC, AMD is also offering <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amd.com/en/gaming/star-wars-bundle&amp;xcust=2-1-1945633-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">free codes for <em>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</em></a> with the purchase of Ryzen 7000-series CPUs. </p>

## Blackmailers are using AI to generate nudes from social media photos

<p>The latest digital security bulletin from the FBI is sure to turn some heads, in both the literal and figurative sense. According to the US federal law enforcement agency, criminals are using AI-generated images to put a new spin on blackmail. They&rsquo;ve been seen using publicly-posted images on social media and running them through an AI image generator to create convincing (but entirely fake) nude photos, then extorting the victims for money or real photos, in a practice the bureau is calling &ldquo;sextortion.&rdquo; </p>



<p>This sort of thing isn&rsquo;t exactly new &mdash; nothing was stopping malefactors from using social media selfies and Photoshop before, and that&rsquo;s happened in some isolated cases. The danger comes from the ease of access to this technique created by new AI &ldquo;deepfake&rdquo; image tools. Now criminals don&rsquo;t need months or years of experience in convincing image manipulation, they just need a few photos and the right software. The bureau says that fake explicit images of both adults and children have been spread on porn sites for general harassment in addition to being sent directly to victims for extortion attempts. The FBI has noticed an increase in victim reports over the last few months. </p>



<p>AI-generated image tools have become incredibly easy to access for the public in the last year. One need only <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1666493/hands-on-with-bing-image-creator-bing-chats-ai-art-tool.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">go to Bing</a> to generate, say, a photo of &ldquo;Marilyn Monroe in lederhosen.&rdquo; Most public-facing AI image generators won&rsquo;t let you train them on a set of specific photos or generate anything verging on pornography. But there are community-created software tools that can be run on individual PCs (often with the help of powerful consumer-grade hardware) without any such restrictions. </p>



<p>Options for victims are few and frustrating. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2023/PSA230605&amp;xcust=2-1-1945525-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">According to the FBI&rsquo;s report</a> (spotted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sextortionists-are-making-ai-nudes-from-your-social-media-images/&amp;xcust=2-1-1945525-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">BleepingComputer</a>), parents are recommended to closely monitor their children&rsquo;s online activity and periodically search for their personal info in places it shouldn&rsquo;t be. A good tip is using reverse image search services like <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/1325808?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;xcust=2-1-1945525-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Google</a> or <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://tineye.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1945525-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">TinEye</a> to find places where your personal photos may have been posted without your consent. Victims are instructed to not pay or otherwise appease blackmailers &mdash; it does not guarantee removal of images or video from the internet &mdash; and otherwise follow standard social media safety steps like declining friend requests from strangers and utilizing any available privacy settings. </p>

## 4K vs. HDR monitors: How to choose

<p>4K and HDR are the peanut butter and jelly of modern televisions. Where you find one, you&rsquo;ll find the other. Together, they&rsquo;re the recipe for a delicious eye-candy sandwich.</p>



<p>Monitors aren&rsquo;t so lucky. While it&rsquo;s possible to find 4K HDR monitors, they are fewer in number and expensive. You&rsquo;ll likely need to choose which feature is more important to you. Here&rsquo;s how to decide.</p>

<h2 id="the-basics-what-do-4k-and-hdr-mean">The basics: What do 4K and HDR mean?</h2>



<p>4K is shorthand for a display&rsquo;s resolution. It typically describes a 16:9 aspect ratio with a resolution of 3,840 x 2,160. Companies occasionally get creative with marketing but, in most cases, will adhere to this definition.</p>



<p>High Dynamic Range describes content that provides a wider range of luminance and color than previously possible. This allows brighter scenes with more contrast and colors. This term does not always refer to a specific standard, though, so it can be a bit fuzzy. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3621898/everything-you-need-to-know-about-hdr-on-your-pc.html">Read our complete guide to HDR on your PC</a> if you want to know the details.</p>

<p>The answer to this question is definitive. 4K is almost always more important than HDR. Most people should heavily favor a 4K display over one that offers HDR if forced to choose between them.</p>



<p>Why? It all has to do with standardization and software support (or the lack of it).</p>



<p>4K is not an especially common resolution even among monitor computer monitors, but it&rsquo;s nothing new. The first mainstream 4K monitors hit store shelves in 2013. Windows 10 released with good interface scaling support that made 4K resolution easy to use and has received additional updates to improve scaling over time. MacOS also has excellent scaling support for 4K resolution due to Apple&rsquo;s focus on high pixel density displays.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/06/display-scale-settings-100893875-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="display scale settings" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/06/display-scale-settings-100893875-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption>
<p>Windows&rsquo; scaling makes a 4K monitor look great even when browsing the web or writing in Word.</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p>HDR is less mature. AMD, Intel, and Nvidia moved to support it only in 2016, but Windows didn&rsquo;t add an HDR toggle until 2017. Windows still can&rsquo;t automatically detect an HDR monitor and enable the appropriate settings, though that feature is expected to arrive soon. HDR support in monitors is the wild west. Only the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://displayhdr.org/&amp;xcust=2-1-394798-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">VESA DisplayHDR certification</a> (which is entirely optional) offers a hint of standardization.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a similar story with content. 4K content is not universal but it&rsquo;s generally easy to find. Virtually all games, even those that are several years old, support 4K resolution. Major video streaming services support 4K resolution, too.</p>



<p>HDR support is less common. Only the latest games are likely to embrace it. Many streaming services don&rsquo;t yet support HDR streaming to a PC&mdash;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3620442/how-to-enable-hdr-in-windows-10.html">and there&rsquo;s some set up to do even when it&rsquo;s possible</a>.</p>



<h2 id="most-hdr-monitors-suck">Most HDR monitors suck</h2>



<p>HDR has another problem. Most HDR monitors sold today are really, really terrible at HDR.</p>



<p>As mentioned, High Dynamic Range enables a wider range of luminance and color. But you&rsquo;ll only enjoy the full benefits on a display with a range of brightness, contrast, and color approaching what HDR standards enable. Most computer monitors do well in color, but falter in brightness in contrast.</p>

<p>Different HDR standards have different limits on the maximum brightness they enable, but at minimum you can expect up to 1,000 nits. Dolby Vision HDR can deliver up to 10,000 nits. Yet most computer monitors max out around 400 nits or less.</p>



<p>Monitors also tend to have poor contrast, which limits the difference between the brightness and darkest areas of the image. Few monitors include the Mini-LED or OLED technology found in modern televisions, though they&rsquo;re become more common (albeit at a fairly steep price).</p>



<p>You can view HDR on any monitor that accepts an HDR signal, no matter its capabilities, but you won&rsquo;t see its full potential unless the monitor is of exceptionally high quality. A monitor with sub-par HDR will look <em>different </em>from SDR&mdash;but it won&rsquo;t always look better.</p>



<h2 id="who-should-care-about-hdr">Who should care about HDR?</h2>



<p>I&rsquo;ve laid out a damning case against most HDR monitors, and for good reason. HDR doesn&rsquo;t make sense for most people right now. So, is there <em>any </em>situation where it makes sense to pick HDR over 4K?</p>



<p>There&rsquo;s two cases where HDR becomes critical. Video creators shooting HDR content may want a great HDR monitor for editing. This will help you understand what viewers with a great HDR display will see.</p>

<p>Bleeding-edge, cost-is-no-obstacle PC gamers should also care about HDR. A great HDR monitor delivers a huge boost in perceived graphics quality. It&rsquo;s the single greatest improvement you can make to a game&rsquo;s visuals, and more modern games are embracing HDR.</p>



<p>However, these scenarios also benefit from 4K resolution. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine a video creator shooting in HDR but not 4K, and gamers who want the absolute best visual quality possible will also crave 4K for its unparalleled sharpness and detail.</p>



<h2 id="prioritize-4k-its-the-easy-choice">Prioritize 4K. It&rsquo;s the easy choice.</h2>



<p>In a sense, computer monitor makers and software developers have made the choice for you. You&rsquo;d of course want to buy a 4K HDR display if it did both well, but few monitors do, and there&rsquo;s a lack of content to view.</p>



<p>A quality 4K monitor like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/803583/asus-tuf-gaming-vg289q-review.html">Asus TUF Gaming VG289Q</a>&mdash;our favorite budget 4K gaming monitor&mdash;can be purchased for well under $400 and is useful no matter how you intend to use it. That makes the 4K vs. HDR debate an easy choice for most people.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve got a large house or a pet that sheds often, you should really consider picking up a robot vacuum, as they&rsquo;re an absolute godsend. If you&rsquo;re in the market for such a device, then you&rsquo;re in luck. Amazon&rsquo;s currently selling the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Lefant-M210-Pro-Self-Charging-Industrial-Grey/dp/B0BGXRZPNY&amp;xcust=2-1-1945452-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Lefant M210 Pro Robot Vacuum Cleaner for $99.99</a>, which is 75 percent off of the original $399.99 price tag. This vacuum has a suction power of 2200Pa, which is ideal for both carpet and hard floors. Let&rsquo;s get into the details then.</p>



<p>The Lefant M210 Pro features two side brushes., 2200Pa of suction power, multiple cleaning modes, and more. The sides brushes are nice because you don&rsquo;t have to untangle hair from a more traditional roller brush. The vauum will also automatically return to the charging station when it&rsquo;s time to juice up. It should run about 120 minutes on a single charge and you can set it up to be controlled via Alexa or Google Assistant with the companion app. </p>

<p>We were smitten with the Creative Pebble from the start, for good reason&mdash;the petite speakers sounded great, yet cost only $25 at launch.</p>



<p>Since then Creative has released several iterations of the Pebble, one of them being the Pebble Pro, which hit store shelves late last year. It&rsquo;s surprisingly feature-rich while offering fantastic audio, and a worthwhile while step up from purely basic speakers.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Further reading:</strong> This review is part of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407990/the-best-budget-computer-speakers.html">our roundup of budget computer speakers</a>. Go there for details on competing products and our buying advice.</p></blockquote>



<h2 id="pebble-pro-design-and-size">Pebble Pro design and size</h2>



<p>When you pull the Pebble Pro out of its box, you&rsquo;ll notice two things immediately. First, it looks just like the other Pebble devices&mdash;sleek and rounded&mdash;with similar proportions. The speakers take about as much room each as an average grapefruit (4.8 x 4.8 x 4.6 inches), and are a nice complement to the boxiness of monitors and PCs, softening the edges on a desk setup. On the bottom of each speaker is a round rubber pad for traction, ringed by a thin LED strip that can glow in rainbow colors. You control the three available light patterns (and color) through the right speaker&rsquo;s controls.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1932620" height="537" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-7.png" width="1024" /><figcaption>You can adjust the color of the Pulsate and Solo RGB lighting modes.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Second, these speakers come with quite a few ports and jacks. On the rear of the right speaker, you&rsquo;ll find a standard USB-C port that can carry both the audio signal and power, a USB-C Power Delivery (PD) port that can amplify the speaker output (but can&rsquo;t carry an audio signal), and an 3.5mm auxiliary-in jack. Also at the back is the hardwired cable connecting the two speakers. On the side of the right speaker you&rsquo;ll find two 3.5mm jacks&mdash;one for headphones, and the other for microphone passthrough. You get Bluetooth 5.3 support as well for pairing with PCs, smartphones, and other devices.</p>



<p>The button for switching between these different connection types can be found on the front of the right speaker, directly next to the volume knob. Pressing it switches between USB, Bluetooth, and aux-in modes; an LED light to the left of the volume knob will change color as you cycle through (purple, blue, and green, respectively).&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="how-does-the-pebble-pro-sound">How does the Pebble Pro sound?</h2>



<p>No matter which connection method you pick, these speakers sound fantastic. High-frequency elements come through crisp and clear, and you get enough bass for balanced audio. The Pebble Pro reproduces vocals, TV and movie dialog, and phone call chatter with accurate detail, and more impressively, it does so at its highest volumes. Normally, distortion is often an issue with budget speakers, but not these.</p>



<p>And the Pebble Pro can really fill a room with sound, in part thanks to its 2.25-inch drivers with 10-watt RMS rating. (The original Pebble was rated at 4.4 watts, and the current Pebble V3 at 8 watts.) That&rsquo;s even when you&rsquo;re drawing power from the standard USB-C port, which works for any of the three connection modes. But you can juice up these speakers by switching to the USB-C PD port and using the aux-in or Bluetooth modes. (Creative recommends its 30-watt power adapter, but you can use any similar one you have on hand.)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>The Pebble Pro reproduces vocals, TV and movie dialog, and phone call chatter with accurate detail, and more impressively, it does so at its highest volumes.</p></blockquote></figure>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Creative 30W power adapter" class="wp-image-1932650" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/creative-30w-power-adapter.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>You can plug the Creative Pebble Pro into a higher-wattage power adapter to amp up the speakers&rsquo; volume.  </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Creative</p></div>



<p>Doing so will squeeze even more volume from these petite speakers&mdash;but most interesting is that you don&rsquo;t just get a higher maximum volume, but an increase in loudness at lower settings, too. In our very informal testing (a sound meter app on our phone, held 10 inches away), the Pebble Pro clocked 74 decibels over a standard USB-C connection with Windows 10 cranked to 100 percent volume. On Creative&rsquo;s 30W power adapter (connected via USB-C PD and aux-in for audio), the average was 80dB.</p>



<p>But the jump in loudness was bigger at 40 and 60 percent volume&mdash;an increase of about 20 percent when using the USB-C PD port and power adapter. That means you can hang out at lower volume percentages and still get plenty of sound. No need to crank until you have a party, at which point you can dial it up and fill your whole living room.</p>



<p>Plugging in 3.5mm headphones sounds just as good as when letting the speakers do their thing, though what headphones you use will influence your experience. Be warned: The volume knob on the speakers affects headphone volume, so if you have it fully cranked, dial it down before putting on your cans. You can accidentally (and painfully) blast yourself with sound if you&rsquo;re not careful.</p>



<h2 id="what-about-the-pebble-pros-microphone-passthrough">What about the Pebble Pro&rsquo;s microphone passthrough?</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Creative Pebble Pro headset and microphone jacks" class="wp-image-1932633" height="438" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/5_pdt_ports.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="983" /><figcaption><p>Highlighted in this picture are the separate 3.5m jacks for headphones and a microphone.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Creative</p></div>



<p>The Pebble Pro has a nifty trick&mdash;you can pass the feed from a 3.5mm microphone through them when in USB mode, which lets you use Creative&rsquo;s software for automatic muting/unmuting during calls, as well as filtering out unwanted noise.</p>



<p>The noise cleanup feature works remarkably well&mdash;and it applies to both incoming and outgoing audio. Creative says the noise canceling is best at eliminating static background sounds like fans, vacuum cleaners, and even lawn mowers, allowing you to speak or listen without those distractions. Our testing shows that it also works well on sounds like mechanical keyboard typing when you&rsquo;re not talking. The recording we took of nonstop typing was virtually dead silent, with just a few seconds of sporadic bleedthrough clatter.</p>



<h2 id="should-you-buy-the-creative-pebble-pro">Should you buy the Creative Pebble Pro?</h2>



<p>You could spend $35 or less on excellent speakers, like one of the Pebble Pro&rsquo;s less full-featured siblings. But if you&rsquo;re seeking more premium features, these speakers offer pleasing, crystal-clear sound with plenty of volume <em>and</em> practical extras that can enhance your PC experience. Plus, the RGB lights are fun to look at.</p>
