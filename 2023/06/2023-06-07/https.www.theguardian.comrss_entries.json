Most drivers already get it, as shown by the huge order books for most electric models. The long-running fight over whether electric or petrol/diesel engines generate more emissions during their lifecycle, further fuelled by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/03/electric-vehicles-early-adopter-petrol-car-ev-environment-rowan-atkinson\">Rowan Atkinson\u2019s recent intervention</a>, is in fact all but over.

The UK government\u2019s own research supports this position and <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1154612/zev-mandate-cost-benefit-analysis.pdf\">concludes</a> that transitioning to zero-emission vehicles would \u201csignificantly\u201d reduce overall carbon use.</p><p>Of course, where the vehicle and battery are manufactured, and how the electricity is generated, make a difference to the carbon benefits of EVs. But helpful and accessible tools such as the Transport &amp; Environment campaign\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.transportenvironment.org/discover/how-clean-are-electric-cars/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw7PCjBhDwARIsANo7CgkZlwbCdlP7yMOFKlYwm90VqQRAU4evR1fZeUETaxaz-4CFcZmW7dAaAncSEALw_wcB\">How clean are electric cars?</a> calculator are doing much to demystify these concerns for the average person.
