The implications of this discovery are deeply troubling, and it is high time we expose the sinister underbelly of social media platforms. The protection of our children must be our utmost priority, and we cannot allow these predators to exploit our digital spaces.</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cBREAKING: Instagram algorithm exposed promoting pedophile networks in massive investigation, video sales, \\u2018preteensex\\u2019 menus, in-person meetups with underage boys and girls, using emojis such as a map and cheese pizza - WSJ\\u201d</div> \u2014 Jack Poso \\ud83c\\uddfa\\ud83c\\uddf8 (@Jack Poso \\ud83c\\uddfa\\ud83c\\uddf8)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/1666448337275346949\">1686147219</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/instagram-vast-pedophile-network-4ab7189\" target=\"_blank\">According to The Wall Street Journal's comprehensive investigation</a>, Instagram has become a hotbed for pedophiles to connect, share explicit content, and target innocent children. This revelation underscores the urgent need for stringent safeguards to ensure the safety of our youth online.</p><blockquote>The pedophilic accounts on Instagram mix brazenness with superficial efforts to veil their activity, researchers found. Certain emojis function as a kind of code, such as an image of a map\u2014shorthand for \u201cminor-attracted person\u201d\u2014or one of \u201ccheese pizza,\u201d which shares its initials with \u201cchild pornography,\u201d according to Levine of UMass. Many declare themselves \u201clovers of the little things in life.\u201d<br /> <br />Accounts identify themselves as \u201cseller\u201d or \u201cs3ller,\u201d and many state their preferred form of payment in their bios. These seller accounts often convey the child\u2019s purported age by saying they are \u201con chapter 14,\u201d or \u201cage 31\u201d followed by an emoji of a reverse arrow.<br /><br />Even glancing contact with an account in Instagram\u2019s pedophile community can trigger the platform to begin recommending that users join it.</blockquote><p>This alarming report should serve as a clarion call for all responsible citizens. We must demand immediate action from Instagram and its parent company, Facebook. The fact that such a vast pedophile network could exist within their platforms is a glaring failure on their part. It is imperative that they take swift and decisive action to purge these predators and make their platforms safe for everyone.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"Instagram's shocking pedophile network exposed in new report\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"221c5\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/instagram-s-shocking-pedophile-network-exposed-in-new-report.png?id=33993590&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>It is clear that the current self-regulation model employed by social media companies is insufficient in safeguarding our children. Stricter regulations must be put in place, with severe penalties for any platform found to be harboring or promoting illegal and harmful activities.

We cannot allow our children to become victims of these heinous crimes facilitated by social media platforms. It is high time we hold these platforms accountable, demand stricter regulations, and actively work towards a safer digital environment for our youth. Together, we can root out this evil, protect our children, and restore the integrity of our digital spaces.

In the UK, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/prayer-army-vet-fined\" target=\"_blank\">you can get arrested for praying</a> -- even <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/praying-arrested-silence\" target=\"_blank\">if you are praying silently</a> -- if you're doing so too close to an abortion mill. The UK government draws imaginary lines and tells you what you can and can't say in those lines.\n</p><p>\n\tIn America, we still have the First Amendment. This man should if nothing else have the same freedom to express himself by yelling Bible passages as, say, these men have to do this:</p><div class=\"twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered\" style=\"display: flex; width: 100%; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"></div> <h3>\"Respect them.\"</h3><br /><p>Another preacher, Matthew Wear, was the one taking the video. The man who got arrested is Damon Atkins. Atkins was being lectured by Police Sergeant Bradley McClure to \"respect them\" and \"let them have their day.\" When Atkins decided not to and started to read a Bible quote, McClure told him \"You're done\" and put him under arrest.</p><p>The quote? \"God is not the author of confusion.\"</p><p>According to the affidavit (<a href=\"https://www.thelancasterpatriot.com/reading-man-arrested-for-quoting-bible/\" target=\"_blank\">via The Lancaster Patriot</a>), McClure told Atkins he could stand across the street and hold his sign. He just wasn't allowed to yell anything. Atkins didn't agree to not speak, so he was arrested for \"Disorderly Conduct Engage in Fighting.\u201d</p><p>Yes. \u201cDespite being warned by police just moments prior, [Atkins] yelled derogatory comments at an organization that was holding a permitted event.\u201d</p><p>Because the group had a permit, Atkins was not allowed to yell things. Though he could stand across the street and hold a sign. Had he just done that and complied, none of this would have happened.</p><p><br /></p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"01cd7\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33958381&amp;width=980\" />\n</p>\n<p>I'm going to go out on a limb and say if it was any group of non-progressives organizing, giving a speech, or having a parade... not a single leftist would get arrested for yelling at them. Though, my only evidence is three years of seeing videos of leftists doing just that while being celebrated in the media. Sometimes while they burn cities down. </p><p>As of this writing, there is no evidence if Target has donated money to the group who had to hear a Bible quote yelled at them.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.
