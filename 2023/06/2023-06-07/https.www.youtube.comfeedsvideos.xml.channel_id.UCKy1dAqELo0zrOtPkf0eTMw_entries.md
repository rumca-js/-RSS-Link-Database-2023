## Why Spider-Verse Succeeds and Fast X Fails

It is the best of times, it is the worst of times — if we're talking about Hollywood's current franchise-forward decree where trilogies and beyond are every studio's goal.

We need look no further than the recent endings of Fast X and Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, which while both are cliffhangers, also play very, very differently from one another. Sure, audiences may have been surprised by how abruptly either film ended, but the ways in which the two hopeful blockbusters executed their cliffhangers — and how they treat their fanbases — speaks volumes about how these larger-than-life franchise films can and should be made.

Let’s dig into why Across the Spider-Verse gets away with what Fast X cannot!

Fast X and Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse are just two recent examples of contemporary moviemaking trends that put a massive stress on milking recognizable IPs for as many "universe" entries as audiences will financially support. It's not an unfounded strategy — think about marathon horror franchises like Friday the 13th that started in the ‘80s or pre-planned trilogies like Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings adaptations. But it has become a crutch for multiplex theaters and superproducers alike. Studios chase the highest profit margins, making decisions based on box office returns. Consumers dictate what hits their screens by talking with their wallets, and right now, the overwhelming data suggests that the average moviegoer wants familiar characters (superheroes), recognizable stories (with superheroes), and the comforts of blockbusters based on known properties (loaded with superhero battles).

Watch the full video for why the latest Spider-Man movie gets away with something Fast X just can't!

## The Whole, Weird Story Leading Up To Transformers: Rise of the Beasts

We’re headed back in time for Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, but before we do, let’s go WAY back to the beginning and make some sense of the wild Transformers movie timeline. Rise of the Beasts takes place in the 90s, just after 2018’s Bumblebee prequel and this time, we got robots that can change into animals! Host Kim Horcher breaks down just how this new Transformers movie fits into everything, so if you need a refresher before Transformers 7, we’ve got you covered. Autobots, roll out!

Bumblebee, Optimus Prime and the gang are set for their seventh live-action film, but Transformers: Rise of the Beasts definitely taps into the Transformers vast history, specifically Transformers Beast Wars, so hopefully the robot gorillas, scorpions and other beasts don’t take Transformers fans completely by surprise. The earlier films in the franchise actually take place later in the timeline so Transformers, Transformers Rise of the Fallen, Dark of the Moon and The Last Knight are all in the future, relative to the timeline. Confusing? Exactly! Allow IGN to untangle this one so you’re ready once Transformers: Rise of the Beasts hits the big screen.
