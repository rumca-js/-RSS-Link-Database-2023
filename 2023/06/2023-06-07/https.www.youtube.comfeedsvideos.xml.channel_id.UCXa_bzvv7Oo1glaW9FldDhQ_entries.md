After the success of 2018's Katamari Damacy REROLL, Bandai Namco is looking to bring more of the classic franchise on to modern systems with We Love Katamari REROLL + Royal Reverie. Alongside featuring the same gameplay as the 2005 PS2 classic, the remaster also features additional levels that explore the backstory of the King of All Cosmos.

We Love Katamari puts you into the shoes of the young Prince as he is tasked by his father—the King of All Cosmos—to roll up objects into massive balls that can then be turned into celestial bodies to fill up the night sky. 

Uniquely, the Young Prince is controlled by making use of both analogue sticks, rather than featuring third-person control schemes we see in modern titles. This unique control system, along with the absolute insanity of the game's writing, visuals and music, all come together to make We Love Katamari REROLL + Royal Reverie an excellent way to revisit a blast from the past.

Fighting game fanatics will be feasting well in 2023. Top brawler Street Fighter has already entered the ring first with its sixth mainline entry coming in June; Tekken 8 will follow sometime later, perhaps before the end of the year; and following its official cinematic reveal in May NetherRealm’s Mortal Kombat will return for its twelfth iteration, ambiguously titled Mortal Kombat 1. 

Although, with the game’s purported canonical soft reboot MK1 looks set to deliver a fresh start for the storied franchise, explaining the suffix ‘1’. Either way, it faces stiff competition from some of fighting games’ heavy hitters to be crowned best brawler of the year. Given the splendour of its cinematic trailer and the promise of a reinvigorated timeline it seems unfathomable Mortal Kombat 1 won’t end 2023 as one of the biggest games of the year.

Ahead of its launch just a few days from now, here, we're going to go over a few key details that you should know about the game.
