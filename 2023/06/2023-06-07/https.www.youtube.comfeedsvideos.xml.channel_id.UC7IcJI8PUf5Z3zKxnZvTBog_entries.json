There are emotions coursing through us \u2014 of anger or joy, resentment or fear \u2014 that lie just outside the sphere of ordinary consciousness, and which elude us as we rush through the challenges of our lives. \n\nThese emotions lie low in part because they are often too shocking, sad or contrary to expectations for us to want to make sense of them. We might hate where we are supposed to love; or may feel sad where we are meant to be practical \u2014 and so, out of timidity and fear, we omit to register our authentic reality. Or else our feelings get ignored because they enter our minds too fast, and in too great a quantity for us to disentangle them in the limited time we devote to self-understanding\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n\nWatch more films on SELF in our playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/TSOLself\n\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-school-of-life-for-business/\n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n\nNa Na Na Studio\nhttps://nananastudio.com/\n\n\nTitle animation produced in collaboration with\n\n\nGraeme Probert\nwww.gpmotion.co.uk", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kt5lL6kifE", "date_published": "2023-06-07 13:00:11+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
