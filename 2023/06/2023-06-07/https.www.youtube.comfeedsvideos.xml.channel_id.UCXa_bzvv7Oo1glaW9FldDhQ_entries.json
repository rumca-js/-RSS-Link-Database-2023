Alongside featuring the same gameplay as the 2005 PS2 classic, the remaster also features additional levels that explore the backstory of the King of All Cosmos.\n\nWe Love Katamari puts you into the shoes of the young Prince as he is tasked by his father\u2014the King of All Cosmos\u2014to roll up objects into massive balls that can then be turned into celestial bodies to fill up the night sky. \n\nUniquely, the Young Prince is controlled by making use of both analogue sticks, rather than featuring third-person control schemes we see in modern titles. This unique control system, along with the absolute insanity of the game's writing, visuals and music, all come together to make We Love Katamari REROLL + Royal Reverie an excellent way to revisit a blast from the past.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zi3Utp0EO0c", "date_published": "2023-06-07 21:30:10+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Microsoft and Xbox Are Missing The Point...", "description": "Microsoft and Team Xbox have to understand the fact that if they want to be market leaders, they need to work on delivering excellent and system selling AAA games.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ5CCP0BZ6M", "date_published": "2023-06-07 17:30:06+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Why Mortal Kombat 1 Will Be One of the BIGGEST GAMES OF THE YEAR", "description": "Fighting game fanatics will be feasting well in 2023. Top brawler Street Fighter has already entered the ring first with its sixth mainline entry coming in June; Tekken 8 will follow sometime later, perhaps before the end of the year; and following its official cinematic reveal in May NetherRealm\u2019s Mortal Kombat will return for its twelfth iteration, ambiguously titled Mortal Kombat 1. \n\nAlthough, with the game\u2019s purported canonical soft reboot MK1 looks set to deliver a fresh start for the storied franchise, explaining the suffix \u20181\u2019. Either way, it faces stiff competition from some of fighting games\u2019 heavy hitters to be crowned best brawler of the year. Given the splendour of its cinematic trailer and the promise of a reinvigorated timeline it seems unfathomable Mortal Kombat 1 won\u2019t end 2023 as one of the biggest games of the year.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWpWeeYbo88", "date_published": "2023-06-07 15:30:15+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Park Beyond - 11 Things You Need To Know Before You Buy", "description": "Management sims, by their very nature, are a very niche genre, but those who get into these games can never quite manage to find their way out.
