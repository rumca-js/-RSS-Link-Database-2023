<p>Tom Holland, the actor best known as Peter Parker/Spider-Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, has announced he'll be taking a year off from acting. This is primarily due to the intense production of his latest show on Apple TV+, The Crowded Room.</p><p dir="ltr">In an interview with <a href="https://extratv.com/2023/06/06/tom-holland-on-taking-a-year-off-after-draining-the-crowded-room-role-exclusive/">Extra</a>, Holland said that the production "Was a tough time, for sure. We were exploring certain emotions that I have definitely never experienced before. And then on top of that, being a producer, dealing with the day-to-day problems that come with any film set, just added that extra level of pressure."</p><p dir="ltr">Holland explained that he enjoyed "the learning curve of becoming a producer," but handling that on top of acting was more than he could handle.

<p dir="ltr">Alongside the release of its latest earnings report, GameStop has fired its president and chief executive officer, Matthew Furlong. Furlong took the reins of CEO almost two years ago to the day.</p><p dir="ltr">No explanation for the move was provided, but it is effective immediately, as of the Board's decision on June 5. The news follows the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamestop-fires-top-executive-layoffs-include-staff-at-game-informer/1100-6505238/">firing of CFO Michael Recupero</a> last year.</p><p dir="ltr">Because Furlong was terminated "without cause," he'll be entitled to a number of benefits as <a href="https://gamestop.gcs-web.com/static-files/57261241-e313-4ae8-b070-8426391fd551">outlined</a> back in June 2021. That includes six months of his base salary (he earned $200,000 annually, among many other bonuses). He also resigned as a member of GameStop's Board of Directors, which has now shrunk to five seats. His "resignation did not result from any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company's operations, policies or practices," the company said in its statement.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamestop-fires-its-ceo-after-two-years/1100-6514929/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Bandai Namco is revamping one of the biggest fads of the 1990s and early 2000s with the Tamagotchi Uni. The new keychain electronic is available to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C6RK9YR6https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C6RK9YR6">preorder now at Amazon</a> for $60 ahead of its July 15 release.</p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C6RK9YR6?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Preorder at Amazon</a> </div><p>Like the original tiny keychain toys, the Tamagotchi Uni contains a tiny digital monster you raise, starting as an egg and slowly growing into a full-grown adult Tamagotchi as you "feed" and care for it. it even features the same egg-like shape, tiny screen, and three-button design of the original toys.</p><figure style="width: 1000px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4148721-gstamaunihero.jpg"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4148721-gstamaunihero.jpg" /></a></figure><p>However, the new Tamagotchi Uni will support online connectivity and Wi-Fi, linking up with other Tamagotchi players through the "Tamaverse." This online service is described as the "Metaverse for Tamagotchi," but appears to simply be a way to play online minigames and collect special items only available through Tamaverse rather than a virtual chatroom. While you cannot send messages or directly interact with other Tamaverse users, the Tamagotchi Uni will still include parental controls to limit online features.

<p>Mojang released its game-changing 1.20 update, Trails and Tales, for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/">Minecraft</a> earlier today, on June 7. It's available now for both Java and Bedrock players. Trails and Tales introduces a wide variety of new content, such as mobs, biomes, recipes, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">As a part of the new update, players will now run into Sniffers, a new passive mob that was voted the winner of Minecraft Live 2022. These mobs can be found in the Suspicious Sand of Warm Ocean Ruins and will occasionally dig for seeds that can be made into the Torchflower Seed or a Pitcher Pod item. In addition to introducing Sniffers, players will now be able to find and ride camels. To ride them, players will need to equip a saddle on them, and once they've done that, two people can ride them around. Camels will naturally spawn whenever Desert Villages generate.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">The Trails &amp; Tales Update is out now! üôå<br />‚ñ™Ô∏è Ride a camel and hatch a sniffer<br />‚ñ™Ô∏è Find a cherry grove and dig an archaeology site<br />‚ñ™Ô∏è Craft with bamboo and trim your armor<br />It's time to head out there and tell your tale! üìñ <a href="https://t.co/MqGAumqsLP">pic.twitter.com/MqGAumqsLP</a></p>  ‚Äî Minecraft (@Minecraft) <a href="https://twitter.com/Minecraft/status/1666460065468141568?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">June 7, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">When you're done playing with the new mobs, make sure to visit the new Cherry Groves biome that can be found in the mountains. As the name suggests, Cherry Grove's biome has unique trees that can't be found anywhere else, and on top of that, the trees will have pink particles fall from them. There'll also be Pink Petals that can be picked up and crafted into other items.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecrafts-1-20-trails-and-tales-update-is-out-now/1100-6514927/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

It sees the return (and live-action debut) of characters like Ezra Bridger, Hera Syndulla, Sabine Wren, and the rambunctious droid Chopper. The new trailer shows all of this off, including Hera engaging in some high-flying battles, Sabine looking wistfully at a hologram of Ezra, and a fleeting glimpse at general Thrawn, whom Ahsoka calls the "heir to the empire."</p><div>          </div><p>In new reveals, the trailer shows Sabine Wren wielding Ezra's lightsaber and combatting a white-haired woman using an orange lightsaber.

## Madden 24 Mercifully Lets Players Turn Off One Of The Series' Worst Features

<p dir="ltr">Madden NFL 24 has been revealed, bringing with it a host of new features to feel hopeful about, such as the Tactical Blocking System meant to enhance blocking AI, as well as the return of practice minigames and Superstar mode. But for me, one of the most exciting bullet points among the many revealed already isn't a new feature at all: It's the option to turn <em>off</em> a feature first introduced in Madden 22: M Factors.</p><p dir="ltr">M Factors derive their name from X Factors, the abilities assigned to the best players to help simulate the way NFL superstars can take over a game. With X Factors, players like Justin Jefferson can become virtually uncoverable if his X Factor is activated. These have been in the game nearly a half-decade now, and generally they do a great job at achieving their goal. The best players should be able to dominate like that, and though some X Factors have had to receive nerfs or tweaks over the years, this is a system I--and seemingly most of the Madden community--really enjoy.</p><p dir="ltr">M Factors are not nearly as fun or well-developed. The M stands for momentum, an already dubious concept one ought not mention around NFL Network's <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickClaybon/status/1591927515702255616">Patrick Claybon</a> or ESPN's <a href="https://twitter.com/billbarnwell/status/1665457464026841089">Bill Barnwell</a>. M Factors are meant to simulate home-field advantage and momentum shifts during a game. Jump out to a 14-0 start, and you'll see your team get buffed or your opponent get nerfed. Each stadium has its own custom M Factor, often meant to represent a real-life aspect of the location, such as Seattle's deafening "12th Man"--a name for the crowd's raucous noise that can feel as disruptive on the field as an additional player. These are a nice idea in theory, but poorly implemented in practice. Thankfully, starting with Madden 24, commissioners in Franchise mode can elect to turn them off.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-24-mercifully-lets-players-turn-off-one-of-the-series-worst-features/1100-6514909/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Production of Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part Two has faced a setback and has now been halted due to the ongoing Writers Guild of America strike, as reported in the latest issue of <a href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/empire-magazine-buy-subscribe-today/">Empire Magazine</a>. The sequel, approximately 40% completed, has been affected by multiple delays, some related to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p dir="ltr">Empire interviewed writer/director Christopher McQuarrie, who discussed the challenges that have slowed down the Mission: Impossible franchise in recent years. The WGA strike has had a significant impact on McQuarrie's work on the film. In the interview, McQuarrie expresses his frustration with the delays, stating (via <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/1306861/mission-impossible-dead-reckoning-part-two-stopped-filming-due-to-writers-strike/">Slashfilm</a>), "It's unrelenting... Behind each tsunami is another tsunami. We live in a state of 24-hour tsunami awareness. That's just what we do."</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">An earlier strike report by <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/05/writers-strike-movie-production-impact-delays-gladiator-2-bad-boys-4-1235341085/">Deadline</a> suggested that the film was already in post-production. However, reshoots and rewrites are common in this franchise known for its pursuit of perfection. In another statement to Empire, McQuarrie acknowledged that at the time of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tom-cruise-shows-off-absolutely-wild-stunt-hes-had-in-mind-for-mission-impossible-for-years/1100-6510143/">a publicized motorcycle stunt</a>, the context had not been fully developed. McQuarrie describes writing as "a living, breathing thing."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mission-impossible-sequel-halts-production-amid-ongoing-writers-guild-strike/1100-6514907/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>If you've been looking in your <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/disney-dreamlight-valley/">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a> collections tab and noticed that you haven't made a Peppermint Tea yet, you're probably curious how to do so. Well, look no further, as we've got the two ingredients listed for you below, as well as information about why you may want to make Peppermint Tea to begin with.</p><h2>How to make Peppermint Tea in Disney Dreamlight Valley</h2><p>You'll first get the recipe for making Peppermint Tea from the Fairy Godmother during her level 7 friendship quest. This recipe--and character--was added to the game in the June 2023 update. However, you don't have to wait for this quest to make some. When you're ready to make a warm cup of Peppermint Tea, you'll only need two ingredients: <strong>Lemon and Mint</strong>.</p><figure style="width: 3840px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4149016-disneydreamlightvalley_20230607122658.jpg"><img alt="Peppermint Tea requires only Lemon and Mint.

When the Fairy Godmother gives you the recipe, make the beverage and take it to Minnie to kick off a fairly lengthy round of additional tasks.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-how-to-make-peppermint-tea/1100-6514910/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Here's what you need to know.</p><h2>Madden 24 cross-play explained: What platforms and game modes use cross-play?</h2><p>Madden 24 cross-play is available on all current-gen versions of the game.

## Forever-Exhausted Alan Wake Will Have Better Stamina In Alan Wake 2

<p>13 years is a long time to spend in one place, especially the Dark Place. Thankfully, Alan has put his time to good use, or so it seems, as Remedy has confirmed with GameSpot that Alan's notoriously lacking stamina will be improved upon for Alan Wake 2.</p><p>While speaking with Remedy for GameSpot's recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/exclusive-alan-wake-2-new-hero-saga-anderson-ushers-in-remedys-darkest-version-of-the-sequel/1100-6514543/">exclusive Saga Anderson reveal</a> story, I'd asked about Saga's physical abilities in the sequel, knowing all too well that Alan's stamina was laughably, even infamously, poor--to be fair, he's a writer, not an athlete. Remedy's director of communications, Thomas Puha, understood what I was getting at and announced the news with a laugh: "We can reveal that Alan's stamina is a lot better this time around. He can actually run more than five meters."</p><p>For players who found Alan's frequent exhaustion to be an annoyance, it seems the sequel will portray the doomed writer as someone more capable with his life on the line--at the very least, adrenaline has got to kick in, right? Still, the sequel is also set to be Remedy's first survival-horror game, so it seems safe to expect some limitations, too, unless Alan has written into existence a treadmill he's been cruising on during his time away.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forever-exhausted-alan-wake-will-have-better-stamina-in-alan-wake-2/1100-6514878/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Review Roundup For The Flash

<div><p>The Flash has faced scrutiny for over a year due to a variety of legal incidents involving star Ezra Miller. The actor was arrested twice in Hawaii on harassment and assault charges, pled guilty to trespassing after being charged with burglary, and has been accused of grooming a minor, among other incidents. The minor in question, now an adult, disputes the grooming allegation. In August 2022, Miller announced they were seeking treatment for "complex mental health issues." Later, in January, The Flash studio Warner Bros. announced that they were standing behind the actor. You can read more about the issues surrounding Miller <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dcu-studios-bosses-fully-support-ezra-millers-recovery-open-to-dcu-return/1100-6511026/">here</a>.</p></div><p dir="ltr">After years of delays and controversies surrounding star Ezra Miller, The Flash film will finally run onto the silver screen June 16. The DC superhero movie adapts the classic Flashpoint storyline and even brings back Michael Keaton's Batman--as well as Ben Affleck's--for a time-traveling tale that's receiving mixed reviews.</p><p dir="ltr">The Flash currently has a 60 metascore based on 28 reviews on GameSpot sister site <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-flash/critic-reviews">Metacritic</a>. The first half of The Flash seems to be the high point for the film, according to reviewers. The narrative is at the forefront along with Miller's Barry Allen. But critics then knocked the final climax battle for a bland CG battle with General Zod, which is teased in trailers for the movie.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-flash-review-fast-paced-fun-at-first-but-runs-out-of-steam/1900-6418077/">The Flash review</a> touches on this, with Phil Owen writing, "For almost two hours, I really enjoyed The Flash. It's a fun romp through the past with big Back to the Future Part 2 vibes, not taking itself seriously enough to be obnoxious. ‚Ä¶That all changes, however, when we hit that CGI money shot from the trailer, with two different Flashes flanking Supergirl as they slide into battle against General Zod."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/review-roundup-for-the-flash/1100-6514891/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Soda companies have been collaborating with gaming brands for years, but Coca-Cola has remained out of that picture--until now. The soda giant recently announced that it's partnering with League Of Legends in producing a limited-edition flavor of its Ultimate Zero Sugar soda, which it dubbed "+XP," for "the taste of experience points."</p><figure style="width: 4000px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1596/15969599/4148953-cocacola1.png"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1596/15969599/4148953-cocacola1.jpg" /></a></figure><p dir="ltr">League players can participate in a series of three missions to unlock ultimate emotes. The three missions are getting 7 assists in a single game for the Ultimate Teamplay emote, earning 12,000 gold in a single game for the Ultimate Gains emote, and winning a game in under 20 minutes for the Ultimate Tempo emote. These missions went live in the game on June 7 and will end on July 18.</p><p dir="ltr">Described as "a unique and bespoke collaboration," each can of the soda includes a QR code that players can scan to enter the "Coca-Cola Creations Hub," which offers digital experiences themed around the drink. For example, later this month, it will feature an Instagram filter that will transform you into a "cinematic gaming hero."

<p>Artificial intelligence has been one of the hottest topics over the last couple of months, and even No Man's Sky is getting involved in that field. Kind of. Singularity, the new free update for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/no-mans-sky/">No Man's Sky</a>, forms the second chapter of the story that was first introduced in Interceptor.</p><div>          </div><p>According to developer Hello Games, the Singularity expedition focuses on the history and origin of the harmonic camps in a mystery that touches upon artificial intelligence, the will to exist, and the very nature of what it means to be alive. The big draw here is that players will be able to build a robotic Construct and take part in a communal goal "that may shape the future" of the universe. By the end of the storyline--which runs for five weeks--No Man's Sky players will have uncovered enough clues that can inform them of what awaits them in the game's next update.</p><p>As for rewards and new gear, Singularity will have plenty of items to obtain. Players can dress up like a machine with a new customization set, new decorations will be available for bases, a groovy an Atlantideum filter can be added to jetpack trails, and the new Wayfarer's helm can be added to player wardrobes. Singularity will arrive alongside a new patch for No Man's Sky, and more details on that <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2023/06/expedition-ten-singularity/">can be found here</a>.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-mans-sky-singularity-update-will-make-you-question-the-meaning-of-life/1100-6514887/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4</a> player has already reached level 100 in Hardcore mode, just a mere days after the game's release. However, this player has lost their level 100 character (and all the gear tied to it) due to an unfortunate disconnect.</p><p>The player, Soua√Øb 'cArn' Hanaf, first reached level 100 in Hardcore mode with a Barbarian character on June 5. Blizzard actually acknowledged cArn's achievement with a <a href="https://twitter.com/diablo/status/1666203313526693892?s=46&amp;t=VClK2mskUB7UBYImaM_JWA">congratulatory tweet</a> the following day.

But then the game froze and cArn got kicked back to the main menu, where they realized their character had been wiped. When playing on Hardcore mode, dying and disconnecting causes your character to be wiped, making it an extremely tough challenge. After losing your character, you have to start over from scratch.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-diablo-4-level-100-hardcore-mode-player-loses-character-due-to-disconnect/1100-6514885/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Streamers are up in arms over a change to Twitch's Branded Content Guidelines, which banned "burned-in" video ads, audio ads, banner ads, and limits on-screen logos to just 3% of screen size. After outcry from streamers, including some of the platform's biggest names, Twitch has released an apology, though hasn't yet clarified how the guidelines will be further modified.</p><p>The initial change was shared on Twitter by streamer Zach Bussey, showing a series of illustrations that demonstrate what will and won't be allowed under the new content guidelines.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">Twitch has new Branded Content Guidelines.<br />- On-stream logos are limited to 3% of screen size.<br />- Burned-in video Ads are NOT allowed.<br />- Burned-in Display Ads are NOT allowed.<br />- Burned-in Audio Ads are NOT allowed.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TwitchNews?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc^tfw">#TwitchNews</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TOSgg?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc^tfw">#TOSgg</a> <a href="https://t.co/QrlrQhGAbm">pic.twitter.com/QrlrQhGAbm</a></p>  ‚Äî Zach Bussey (@zachbussey) <a href="https://twitter.com/zachbussey/status/1666111039736258561?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">June 6, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Streamers immediately took issue with the changes, which would eat into revenue streamers are able to make from brand sponsorships--which is especially important after the controversial <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/twitch-is-changing-its-revenue-split-for-its-biggest-streamers-from-2023/1100-6507709/">50/50 revenue split</a> came into play late last year.

<p> Do you still have an active Wordle group chat, but find the thrill of beating your friends/family/coworkers in one-off puzzles isn't quite enough? The New York Times has just introduced <a href="https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1666122805035905037">Wordle Golf,</a> a competitive ruleset for Wordle inspired by golf, where a group can compete over nine days to crown a definitive Wordle master.</p><p>Instead of assigning higher scores to earlier guesses, this competitive take on Wordle has been based around golf, where your goal is to get as few points as possible. The NYT points out that Wordle is a little easier than actual golf--especially when it comes to a "hole-in-one," which in golf is a 12,500 to one chance, while your chance of guessing the Wordle straight away is only a few thousand to one.</p><p>To play Wordle Golf, you'll need to get a group together who all agree to play Wordle for nine consecutive days. Then, all you need to do is tally your scores from each day, with the winner being the person with the lowest score at the end. Your daily score is based off the number of guesses taken to complete the puzzle, with extra penalties for missing a day or spoiling the answer.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-now-play-a-competitive-version-of-wordle/1100-6514879/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
