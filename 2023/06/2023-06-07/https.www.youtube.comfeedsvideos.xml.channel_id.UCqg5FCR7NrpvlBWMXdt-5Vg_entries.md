This week on Breakout, with the year at the half-way point, we discuss the current state of games and how over the last few weeks, things have really started heating up in a great way.

Featuring Nick Calandra, Marty Sliva, and KC Nwosu, the freeform podcast dives into a bit of our daily lives, the latest games, movies, tv shows and books, the occasional craft beer review and random topics we find interesting.
