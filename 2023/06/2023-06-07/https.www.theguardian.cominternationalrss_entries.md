<ul><li>Norwegian topples Dane 6-1, 6-2, 3-6, 6-3 in quarter-finals</li><li>Ruud will now face Alexander Zverev in the last four</li></ul><p>By the midpoint of the clay-court season, even as he navigated his favourite surface, Casper Ruud was still struggling. A year on from his breakout 2022, when he reached the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jun/05/french-open-tennis-rafael-nadal-casper-ruud-match-report">final at the French</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/sep/11/carlos-alcaraz-wins-us-open-final-tennis-casper-ruud-world-no-1">and US Open</a> tournaments, rising to world No 2, Ruud’s form had collapsed. He played nervous and tight tennis, retreating far behind the baseline, allowing opponents to dominate.</p><p>Still, Ruud kept his head down. He worked hard with a positive attitude and in the biggest clay tournament, his unwavering mentality has afforded him more success. In a highly anticipated reprise of the all-Scandinavian grudge match last year, Ruud impressively held off a late surge from an otherwise tired Holger Rune to reach his second consecutive French Open semi-final with a 6-1, 6-2, 3-6, 6-3 win.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/07/casper-ruud-dominates-rune-at-french-open-to-continue-clay-resurgence">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Regime is using sport as a tool for soft power but has failed to wash away sickening track record on human rights</p><p>Looking back, so much of it was already there on that night in Diriyah when a storm raged across the desert and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/07/anthony-joshua-andy-ruiz-jr-job-done-odd-arabian-night" title="">Anthony Joshua made history</a> – and £60m – by retaining his world heavyweight title belts.

Photographer inspired by the ordinary lives of the people he met on the streets who believed in ‘shoot first, think later’<p>Paul Ickovic, who has died aged 79, belonged to a generation of humanist photographers who strove to capture the poetry in ordinary lives with a compassionate lens. His nomadic early life had taught him to reject states and borders, and for him there was no state above that of human. He roamed the world’s streets in a search for moments that would spark discomfort and joy.</p><p>His photographs were often of <a href="https://www.paulickovic.photography/one-thing-leads-to-another" title="">solitary figures</a>, capturing their moments of introspection and alienation; a chambermaid in Prague, a diner in Boston or a Cuban waitress. Location was unimportant, for he wanted the viewer to extrapolate from a single image and recognise something of themselves – to be upset or uplifted by the reflection. Yet he was always taciturn about the meaning of his photography, once saying: “It needs no explanation; if the work is provocative, it needs only to exist.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/07/paul-ickovic-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

It was just about the only thing Head failed to make clean contact with all day, flicking mainly fingers as the batters crossed. Some of the fielders might have been tempted to flick a few fingers in his direction as well, Head having arrived at the crease with India dominant before powerfully, remorselessly turning the flow of the game in Australia’s favour and hauling them to 327 for three at the close.</p><p>A few hours earlier India had won the toss – greeted by a partisan crowd as if the Beatles had just walked on stage at Shea Stadium – and chosen to suffer.

<p>Most people would jump at the chance to see a West End musical. The prospect fills me with dread</p><p>I’m off to see Groundhog Day, the musical, at the Old Vic in London. It’s based on the 1993 film in which Bill Murray’s character relives the same day over and over. Although I’m sure it will be great, it involves one obvious drawback: having to leave the house. These days, I have less and less appreciation of how the outside world works. Having to interact with anyone or anything outside my normal daily routine leaves me with a feeling of cold dread.</p><p>It turns out that I’m more than happy in my own little groundhog day. I wake up, work all day at my computer in my kitchen (the nearest working space to the kettle), probably pop to the supermarket at some point, maybe fit in some exercise, watch telly, go to bed, rinse and repeat. My life is a predictable triangle.

French painter who wrote about her relationship with the artist Pablo Picasso in a bestselling book<p>In 1943 the artist Françoise Gilot, who has died aged 101, accompanied her teacher, the surrealist painter Endre Rozsda, to the Gare de l’Est in Paris. Rozsda was Jewish and Hungarian; the occupying Germans had begun rounding up foreign Jewish people, and he was leaving for the apparent safety of Budapest. As his train steamed out of the station, the 21-year-old Gilot wailed: “But what am I to do?” Her teacher, laughing, shouted: “Don’t worry! Who knows? Three months from now, you may meet Picasso!”</p><p>Seven decades later Gilot was to recall those words as both prophecy and curse. Two months after Rozsda’s departure she was having dinner at Le Catalan, a Paris restaurant patronised by Left Bank artists. Halfway through the meal a short, bull-necked man approached her table proffering a bowl of cherries: it was Pablo Picasso. Captivated by the fine-boned Gilot, Picasso, 40 years her senior, invited her to his studio in the Rue des Grands Augustins. By the end of the summer they were lovers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/07/francoise-gilot-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>He may have the dullest material in acting history – but Sky News’s Prince Harry stand-in is giving a heartbreaking performance in a show shot with all the panache of the world’s crappest gameshow. More!</p><p>Cast your mind back, if you will, to 2005. Michael Jackson found himself charged with molesting a 13-year-old boy at his Neverland ranch, and was tried in the Santa Barbara County Superior Court before the world’s media. The trial was closed to broadcast cameras, so Sky chose to cover the case the next best way, by hiring a Michael Jackson impersonator to wear his silliest wig, put on his silliest voice and read out real-life court transcripts on a nightly reenactment show entitled Michael Jackson Trial.</p><p>You might (correctly) remember what an all-out horror show the programme was; a cavalcade of bad wigs, stilted delivery, nightmarish prosthetics and the sort of tinpot production that makes a daytime soap opera look like an Avatar movie. It was bad, gimmicky television, designed for nothing but the worst kind of boggle-eyed rubbernecking, and it was destined never to be repeated.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/07/prince-harry-actor-car-crash-tv-sky-news">Continue reading...</a>

All of which makes Linda Yueh’s new book almost alarmingly timely, as if she were tanking the global economy as the mother of all guerrilla marketing stunts.</p><p>She opens with the bad news: economic crashes are a fact of life, and there will always be another one coming. Not only that, but however much they have in common – she surveys 10, from 1929 to 2020 – the next one will be the result of a novel combination of factors.

<p>The noble chafer beetle is in decline owing to the destruction of the habitat that its larvae need to thrive</p><p>Few UK bugs are more exotic than the noble chafer beetle, <em>Gnorimus nobilis</em>. It is currently emerging from the larval stage after three years of chewing the decaying wood of old fruit trees. The adult is a shiny metallic green speckled with white and is 2cm long. When the light strikes it, the beetle appears iridescent and can flash copper and gold. It spends the next six weeks of summer feeding on elderflower, hogweed and meadowsweet.</p><p>Like so many once-common species, it is the destruction of formerly numerous old orchards, the habitat its larva need to thrive, that have led to its decline. It is mainly found in Worcestershire, Gloucestershire and Herefordshire, but also recorded in the New Forest, Oxfordshire and Kent, although it may survive elsewhere. It can be confused with the more common rose chafer, which is a similar colour but has smooth wing cases while the noble chafer’s are wrinkled.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/07/noble-cause-protecting-englands-orchards-to-save-a-beetle">Continue reading...</a>
