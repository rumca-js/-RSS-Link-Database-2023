Theres no debate that stunt work is the most dangerous job in the film industry.  When Andy Samberg and the rest of the Lonely Island crew set out to make Hot Rod, they knew things had to be dialed up.   The reason Hot Rod works so well is because of the commitment by the stunt team.  With out a dedicated crew, Hot Rod wouldn't have been the cult classic it is today.
