Amid a cheering crowd, the C919, China's first domestically produced large passenger aircraft, completed its commercial maiden flight on May 28, 2023, and officially entered the civil aviation market. The Chinese Communist Party CCP media claimed that China has finally said goodbye to the history of "800 million shirts for one plane." What does that mean? It means that at a time when China was technologically backward, it only had shirts, not planes, and had to use the profits from exporting 800 million shirts to buy a large airliner. We believe that the CCP has cheered too soon.

As the pressure of employment becomes increasingly intense, the "four no's" lifestyle has also emerged. "Going to school has already cost me more than a decade of my life, and then working super hard for another 40 years. Life is so short, only a few decades. Why should I pay for the capital speculation of overpriced properties?" This is what people born after the year 2000 are now saying. "We have become the biggest natural enemy of real estate now. "
