  <p id="bZb1ue">Apple has a new development framework that can be used to turn your iPhone into an autonomous pet-tracking camera. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10304/">According to documentation on Apple’s website</a>, developers can use pet-tracking features with motorized phone stands to capture and follow your pet around your house while you’re not home.</p>
<p id="yz3YLJ">As noted by Apple, developers can achieve this using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/DockKit">a new framework called DockKit</a>, which can create “photo and video experiences” while an iPhone is mounted on a motorized stand. From there, devs can then use something called the Animal Body Pose API (application programming interface), which is capable of identifying and tracking animals with your phone’s camera. It’s able to identify a pet’s pose, too, including if your pet is sitting...</p>

  <p id="QezdS1">New York was eerily orange on Wednesday as smoke shrouded the city. The haze drifted in from wildfires raging in Quebec, some 500 miles away, wreaking havoc on air quality across the Northeast US.</p>

<p id="KhNVuo">On Tuesday, Twitch released new rules concerning the way streamers could display ads on the platform. The rules prohibited “burned in” video, display, and audio ads — the first two of which were popular and common formats used throughout Twitch. Twitch apparently did not discuss the new rules with ambassadors or streamers beforehand, and many were furious about the new policies. </p>
<p id="zQkS2x">Twitch content creators took to social media to decry the changes.

Having arguably the best player in the game is a big coup for both the club and the league — but also for Apple, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/14/23167555/apple-tv-mls-live-sports-streaming">which has MLS streaming rights for the next decade</a>.</p>

  <p id="03xSQZ">Reddit is creating an exemption to its unpopular new API pricing terms for makers of accessibility apps, which could come as a big relief for some developers worried about how to afford the potentially expensive fees and the users that rely on the apps to browse Reddit. As long as those apps are noncommercial and “address accessibility needs,” they won’t have to pay to access Reddit’s data.</p>

  <p id="4k4IUi">WordPress is getting a sleek new AI plug-in that can generate and edit text. The tool is called the <a href="https://jetpack.com/ai/">Jetpack AI Assistant</a> and is available free to WordPress.com users “for a limited time,” while other Jetpack users get 20 free requests and have to pay a monthly $10 fee after that. It’s the latest example of AI text-generation software, but its availability on one of the world’s biggest blogging and content management platforms will spread this technology further still across the web.</p>
<p id="R3OO3f">The assistant is the work of Automattic, the company that owns WordPress.com and contributes to the development of the open-source WordPress platform. Automattic <a href="https://jetpack.com/blog/introducing-jetpack-ai-assistant/">describes</a> the tool as a “creative writing partner” that lets users “generate diverse content at...</p>

  <p id="UemSU4">EVs are getting big — too big, some say — so it’s refreshing to see Volvo trend in the other direction. The Swedish automaker’s next EV, the compact EX30 SUV, is powered by a modest battery that nevertheless manages to churn out a decent amount of range.</p>
<p id="NEM76X">But more compelling than that is the starting price tag of $34,950, which is impressive when you consider how expensive EVs have gotten in recent years. Volvo is leaning into the “small” motif, referring to today’s announcement as an “unboxing” event. An early teaser image featured a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/9/23716016/volvo-ex30-electric-suv-global-debut-date">giant hand coming down from the sky</a> to pick up the EX30. </p>

Apple’s latest iPadOS 17 developer beta includes support for a variety of USB webcams and even cameras connected through devices <a href="https://twitter.com/jbivphotography/status/1666180017972211714">like Elgato’s Cam Link 4K</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/imPatrickT/status/1666079345562259460">mirrorless cameras</a> that have webcam modes.</p>
<p id="tjg6xk">Twitter user Stephen Robles has demonstrated the USB webcam support and notes that it only works in FaceTime right now. That’s because this is a new underlying API in iPadOS 17 and developers will need to update their apps to support the new camera options. It will be particularly useful for apps like Zoom or Microsoft Teams to be able to use external USB cameras and webcams.</p>
