Sure, audiences may have been surprised by how abruptly either film ended, but the ways in which the two hopeful blockbusters executed their cliffhangers \u2014 and how they treat their fanbases \u2014 speaks volumes about how these larger-than-life franchise films can and should be made.\n\nLet\u2019s dig into why Across the Spider-Verse gets away with what Fast X cannot!\n\nFast X and Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse are just two recent examples of contemporary moviemaking trends that put a massive stress on milking recognizable IPs for as many \"universe\" entries as audiences will financially support. It's not an unfounded strategy \u2014 think about marathon horror franchises like Friday the 13th that started in the \u201880s or pre-planned trilogies like Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings adaptations. But it has become a crutch for multiplex theaters and superproducers alike. Studios chase the highest profit margins, making decisions based on box office returns. Consumers dictate what hits their screens by talking with their wallets, and right now, the overwhelming data suggests that the average moviegoer wants familiar characters (superheroes), recognizable stories (with superheroes), and the comforts of blockbusters based on known properties (loaded with superhero battles).\n\nWatch the full video for why the latest Spider-Man movie gets away with something Fast X just can't!", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPZY_Swx1ms", "date_published": "2023-06-07 13:15:06+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "No Man's Sky: Singularity - Official Trailer", "description": "Check out the trailer for No Man's Sky: Singularity, the game's new expedition.

Rise of the Beasts takes place in the 90s, just after 2018\u2019s Bumblebee prequel and this time, we got robots that can change into animals! Host Kim Horcher breaks down just how this new Transformers movie fits into everything, so if you need a refresher before Transformers 7, we\u2019ve got you covered. Autobots, roll out!\n\nBumblebee, Optimus Prime and the gang are set for their seventh live-action film, but Transformers: Rise of the Beasts definitely taps into the Transformers vast history, specifically Transformers Beast Wars, so hopefully the robot gorillas, scorpions and other beasts don\u2019t take Transformers fans completely by surprise. The earlier films in the franchise actually take place later in the timeline so Transformers, Transformers Rise of the Fallen, Dark of the Moon and The Last Knight are all in the future, relative to the timeline.
