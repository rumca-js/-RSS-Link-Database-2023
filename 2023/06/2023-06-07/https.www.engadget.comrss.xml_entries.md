## Reddit says some accessibility apps won’t have to pay for its API

<p>Reddit is changing its controversial new API policy for the makers of some apps that are focused on accessibility, provided they don’t monetize their services. As <em>The Verge</em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/7/23752804/reddit-exempt-accessibility-apps-api-pricing-changes"><ins>reports,</ins></a> Reddit has decided to offer the developers of select “non-commercial” apps that emphasize accessibility features an exemption from its controversial new pricing structure.</p><p>“We’ve connected with select developers of non-commercial apps that address accessibility needs and offered them exemptions from our large-scale pricing terms,” Reddit spokesperson Tim Rathschmidt said in a statement. He declined to name any specific services or share how many apps might be covered by the new exemption, citing ongoing conversations with developers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The concession comes amid growing anger with Reddit over the planned changes, which many developers say will put them out of business. Last week, Christian Selig, the developer of Apollo, said the new pricing would cost him <a href="https://www.engadget.com/reddit-app-developer-says-the-sites-new-api-rules-will-cost-him-20-million-a-year-203911487.html"><ins>$20 million</ins></a> a year to keep the app running in its current state. Other developers have voiced similar concerns about the changes, currently slated to take effect July 1st.</p><p>As <em>The Verge</em> points out, the API changes have also sparked widespread concern among Reddit users who depend on services that make it easier to use the site with screen readers and other accessibility aids. Earlier this week, the moderators of r/Blind said they were planning to join the upcoming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/reddit-communities-are-going-dark-to-protest-changes-that-would-hurt-third-party-apps-154133342.html"><ins>Reddit blackout</ins></a> in protest of the changes. The effort, which more than 1,000 subreddits have signed onto, will see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/"><ins>participating</ins></a><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/143fzf6/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=ModCoord&amp;utm_content=t3_1401qw5"><ins>communities</ins></a> “go dark” for 48 hours.</p><p>While the latest change from Reddit could bring some relief to the members of r/Blind and others who depend on apps specifically tailored to their needs, the rule change won’t help the majority of third-party app developers. Apps like Apollo, RIF and BaconReader are monetized and thus don’t qualify for an exemption even though some also offer robust accessibility features. Unless Reddit makes further concessions, those developers are still facing the possibility that they will be forced to shut down, or drastically alter, their services.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/reddit-says-some-accessibility-apps-wont-have-to-pay-for-its-api-213401412.html?src=rss

<p>Amazon is reportedly planning to introduce an ad-supported tier to its Prime Video platform. <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2f007401-3eaa-4237-b69b-54ccbe125502&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Wall+Street+Journal&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyZjAwNzQwMS0zZWFhLTQyMzctYjY5Yi01NGNjYmUxMjU1MDIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9hbWF6b24tcGxhbnMtYWQtdGllci1mb3ItcHJpbWUtdmlkZW8tc3RyZWFtaW5nLXNlcnZpY2UtODk0NGZlNTE_bW9kPWRqZW1hbGVydE5FV1MiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImU3MGEyODAwLTZmY2YtNDQwMy05MTAxLTU0Mzc1MzhjYmQyMyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAeWRluA3bceuWDshicP8gRvELnyjoA4lIH66MYFdUZ0w&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Famazon-plans-ad-tier-for-prime-video-streaming-service-8944fe51%3Fmod%3DdjemalertNEWS"><em><ins>The Wall Street Journal</ins></em></a> reports that discussions are in the early stages and have been going on for the past several weeks.</p><p>The report goes on to say that advertisers are eager for Amazon to jump on board, as other players such as Netflix, have recently added an ad-supported option to their lineup.

Users can currently use Amazon’s Channel feature to subscribe to a whole host of streaming services, which include ad-free versions of Paramount+ and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hbo-max-amazon-prime-video-channels-143851389.html"><ins>Max</ins></a>.</p><p>Amazon Prime Video is currently $8.99 per month on its own or as part of an Amazon Prime membership.

It’s unclear when Amazon plans on introducing this ad-supported plan or what pricing may look like, but it should help lower the cost for those looking to subscribe to Amazon Prime Video and don’t mind ads.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/amazon-is-reportedly-planning-an-ad-supported-tier-for-prime-video-201032287.html?src=rss

## Paradox Interactive will refund physical pre-orders for ‘Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2’

<p>Paradox Interactive <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-juneupdate">announced</a> today that it will refund all physical pre-orders for <em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</em>. The long-delayed sequel to the 2004 cult classic was last available for pre-sales in early 2021. That was when Paradox announced it was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-indefinite-delay-165029556.html">parting ways</a> with developer Hardsuit Labs and pushing back the title’s release date indefinitely. However, there may be a glimmer of hope for holdouts as the publisher teased more news coming in September about the vampire game.</p><p>Paradox says it’s refunding the pre-orders because the previous physical edition included bonus-content items “no longer representative of the game.” Physical variants include the Collector’s Edition created and sold by DPA Merchandising GmbH and boxed versions of the First Blood, Unsanctioned and Blood Moon editions. Additionally, Paradox will grant digital pre-order refunds for anyone who requests one. Refund instructions vary depending on where you ordered it, but you can check <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-juneupdate-faq">Paradox’s FAQ</a> for storefront-specific guidance.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Videogame screenshot of a dark alley with street art, old tires and other random objects lying about." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/764030c0-0568-11ee-9726-acc819e1b0b3" style="height: 1080px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption>A new 2023 screenshot from ‘Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2.’</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Paradox Interactive</div></figure><p>“As development continues, we will be updating the game’s editions and bonus content, and we want to provide the best value to those of you who supported us via digital pre-order after all this time,” Paradox wrote today. “We’re excited to show you more and hope to have all of you with us in September when we reveal more.”</p><p><em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</em> was initially slated for 2020 before being <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-2021-200243795.html">pushed back</a> to 2021 and then shelved indefinitely after Paradox <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/8/19/21376269/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-writer-director-fired-hardsuit-labs-paradox-interactive">fired</a> the game’s creative director and lead writer. The publisher hasn’t yet announced the title’s new developer, although it says it will tell us that in September as well. As for an updated release date, Paradox stops short of explicitly promising one in its September announcements, but it assures gamers it will “share more information about the launch” at that time.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/paradox-interactive-will-refund-physical-pre-orders-for-vampire-the-masquerade---bloodlines-2-195302462.html?src=rss

## NYC sues Hyundai for negligence in wake of TikTok car thefts

<p>Last month, Hyundai <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundai-will-pay-200-million-after-a-tiktok-challenge-exposed-a-huge-security-flaw-133327405.html">agreed to pay $200 million to settle a class action lawsuit</a> in the wake of a viral <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/08/tiktok-challenge-spurs-rise-in-thefts-of-kia-hyundai-cars.html">TikTok car theft challenge</a>. The deal promised to pay out about $145 million to US Hyundai and Kia owners who had their cars stolen or damaged by a theft attempt — but the settlement didn't put the matter to rest. New York City has announced that it's <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hyundai-kia-new-york-tiktok-60bcd71fa1fc7f32ba91ed1b57c7e179">now suing the automaker for negligence</a> and being a public nuisance.</p><p>Specifically, the city accuses the automaker of choosing to &quot;sacrifice public safety for profits&quot; by eschewing common anti-theft technology from certain US model Kia and Hyundai vehicles. New York City alleges this was a market specific choice, noting that Hyundai and Kia vehicles sold in European and Canadian markets do, in fact, have vehicle immobilizers installed &quot;because regulations there expressly require them.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This led to a rise in thefts after the &quot;Kia Challenge&quot; went viral on TikTok earlier this year — with videos demonstrating how certain Hyundai vehicles can be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundai-and-kia-release-software-update-to-prevent-tiktok-thefts-193056722.html">quickly hot-wired using a simple USB cord</a>.</p><p>The result, the city says, was unprecedented, with a 660% increase in Hyundai and Kia vehicle thefts in the first four months of 2023 when compared to the previous year. New York City says this has resulted in not only more reports of theft, but other safety issues, including reckless driving, and violent altercations between thieves and vehicle owners, all of which it claims has made New York City less safe and caused undue burden on police resources. New York City is requesting a trial by jury and is seeking punitive and compensatory damages.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/nyc-sues-hyundai-for-negligence-in-wake-of-tiktok-car-thefts-192644446.html?src=rss

<p>Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-finally-announces-the-15-inch-macbook-air-170715355.html">announced</a> its newest laptop, the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMEM3NVpSUUxCP3RoPTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMTIzLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4ZGUwY2VkNy1lM2Q0LTQzNzEtODkxYS1iMzkxYTZiNmZkZmUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAcS2LkpcClnAIPMmnhL6PR6fk5zlX5a3GfECU0NM0AFO&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0C75ZRQLB%3Fth%3D1">15-inch MacBook Air</a>, this Monday during the brand's annual Worldwide Developers Conference — and there's already at least one retailer offering a nearly $50 discount on pre-orders. Apple set the retail price at $1,299, but right now Amazon is listing it for $1,249.99. You won't see big red discount numbers or really any indication that its on sale, other than the fact that it's cheaper than at any other retailer. The discount applies to the 256GB storage configuration in either Silver or Midnight. The larger, 512GB versions are also $49 off, but only in the Starlight or Space Gray colorways.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Amazon has a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/14-inch-macbook-pro-apple-deals-discount-amazon-best-buy-172511277.html">history</a> of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-is-offering-50-or-100-gift-cards-with-samsung-galaxy-s23-pre-orders-195933336.html">promoting</a> discounts that are small but notable (hey, $50 is $50) on new and desirable products, in the hopes that you buy your new device from its site over the competition. Apple's announcement came after many months of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-15-inch-macbook-air-12-inch-revival-170337389.html">speculation</a> that the company would put out a laptop with a screen large enough for serious productivity, without making people spring for the extra cost (and potentially superfluous processing power) of the Pro model laptops.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Our deputy editor Cherlynn Low was on the ground at WWDC and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-15-inch-preview-portable-power-213455527.html">had a chance</a> to put her hands on the newest MacBook. She was impressed by how light and thin it is at just 3.3 pounds and measuring under a half-inch thick. She reported that the Liquid Retina display was rich, vibrant and sharp. A demonstration of its processing power seemed speedy enough — that's not surprising as it has the same M2 chip as the 13-inch MacBook Air, which performs <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-air-m2-review-2022-130040098.html">remarkably</a> well. But we'll need to get a unit in for testing before we can properly evaluate it.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, here's what the new 15-inch MacBook Air offers: A 15.3-inch Liquid Retina display, a 1080p camera and a promised 18-hour battery life. The M2 chip in the base model has an 8-core CPU and a 10-core GPU, instead of the optional 8-core GPU you can get with the 13-inch version. It has the same 8GB of RAM as the smaller model (which is configurable to 24GB) and the same storage options, either 256GB or 512GB (both configurable up to 2TB of SSD). The MBA 15 sadly didn't add any additional ports — you'll still just two Thunderbolt 4 ports with MagSafe plug for power and a 3.5mm headphone jack.&nbsp;</p><p>When you pre-order now, your new MacBook Air should ship out next week.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter and </em><a href="https://subscription.yahoo.net/Newsletter/Preference/sub?b=engadgetdeals&amp;src"><em>subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter</em></a><em> for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apples-new-15-inch-macbook-air-is-already-49-off-at-amazon-184600287.html?src=rss

Technically, <em>Usagi Yojimbo</em> is set during the Edo period in Japan, but that hasn’t stopped him from showing up in modern day NYC to do battle with Shredder’s minions. To that end, the DLC will include a number of time portals that bring the ronin bunny to the present day and bring the turtles back to 17th century Japan.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="5102469ef98a43979bcb2ff3a668b6e3"></div><p>The trailer clearly advertises the presence of new characters, plural, but only Usagi is mentioned by name.

<p>A documentary about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/hideo-kojima/">Hideo Kojima</a>, one of the most lauded video game designers on the planet, is on the way. A trailer offers a first peek at what's in store for those who plan to check out <em>Hideo Kojima: Connecting Worlds.</em></p><p>Kojima <a href="https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1666445949504192515">wrote on Twitter</a> that the film will provide a behind-the-scenes look at the development of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/death-stranding/"><em>Death Stranding</em></a>, as well as &quot;shots from the early days of our independent studio, memories from my childhood and my creative journey.&quot; The trailer encapsulates all of that while suggesting the film is a celebration of Kojima and his work. Friends, collaborators and fans including Geoff Keighley, Guillermo del Toro, Norman Reedus and George Miller are shown talking up Kojima and his credentials.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Whether Kojima truly is &quot;the first auteur of video games&quot; is up for debate, especially if you're of the mind that the auteur theory can't apply to the highly collaborative process of game development. Still, there's no denying that Kojima is a vanguard in his industry. He's a fascinating guy who is behind some of the most memorable and inventive games of the last few decades, which makes him good fodder for a documentary.</p><p>PlayStation Studios and Kojima Productions helped to produce <em>Hideo Kojima: Connecting Worlds, </em>for which there's no release date as yet. The film <a href="https://tribecafilm.com/films/hideo-kojima-connecting-worlds-2023">will premiere</a> at the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tribeca-film-festival-games-official-selection-award-advisory-board-164218515.html">Tribeca Festival</a> on June 17th and Kojima will be in attendance for a Q&amp;A.

## Harvard’s synthetic heart valve is designed to grow in step with the human body

<p>Researchers have developed a promising synthetic heart valve that may eventually be used for growing children. Harvard’s Wass Institute and John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) created what they call <a href="https://wyss.harvard.edu/news/new-spun-fiber-heart-valve-is-a-step-closer-to-patients/">FibraValve</a>. This implant can be manufactured in minutes using a spun-fiber method that lets them shape the valve’s delicate flaps on a microscopic level — ready to be colonized by the patient’s living cells, developing with them as they mature.</p><p>FibraValve is a follow-up to <a href="https://wyss.harvard.edu/technology/jetvalve-for-heart-regeneration/">JetValve</a>, the team’s 2017 artificial heart valve that employed many of the same principles. The updated version uses “focused rotary jet spinning,” which adds streams of focused air to more quickly and accurately collect synthetic fibers on a spinning mandrel — making it easier to fine-tune the valve’s shape. As a result, the polymer’s micro- and nano-fibers can more precisely replicate the tissue structure of an organic heart valve. The manufacturing process takes less than 10 minutes; <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-10-13-time-machines-artificial-beats.html">alternative methods</a> can require hours.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Diagram showing various parts of the FibraValve process: a device on the left (including motor, air inflow and solution tubes) forming a stream of fibers gathered on a collection mandrel with motor (right)." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/c9f7ea00-0559-11ee-beec-68b43c96c71b" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Wyss Institute at Harvard University</div></figure><p>The technique also uses “a new, custom polymer material” called PLCL (a combination of polycaprolactone and polylactic acid) that can last inside a patient’s body for about six months — enough time (in theory) for the patient’s cells to infiltrate the structure and take over. Although it’s only been successfully tested in sheep so far, the long-term vision is for the resulting organic tissue to develop with human children as they mature, potentially voiding the need for risky replacement surgeries as their bodies grow. “Our goal is for the patient’s native cells to use the device as a blueprint to regenerate their own living valve tissue,” said corresponding author Kevin “Kit” Parker in Harvard's press release.</p><p>In the researchers’ test on a living sheep, the FibraValve “started to function immediately, its leaflets opening and closing to let blood flow through with every heartbeat.” Additionally, they observed red and white blood cells and fibrin protein collecting on the valve’s scaffolding within the first hour. The scientists say the synthetic valve showed no signs of damage or other problems. “This approach to heart valve replacement might open the door towards customized medical implants that regenerate and grow with the patient, making children’s lives better,” said co-author Michael Peters in the same press release.</p><p>The research is still preliminary, and the team plans to conduct longer-term animal testing over weeks and months for further evaluation. However, they believe their breakthrough could eventually find other uses, including creating different valves, cardiac patches and blood vessels.

<p>Disney+ has set a premiere date of August 23rd for the highly-anticipated <em>Star Wars: Ahsoka </em>series. The show takes place in the same timeline of <em>The Mandalorian,</em> but stars a character that, sort of, goes all the way back to the prequels. Former Jedi Knight Ahsoka Tano first appeared in the <em>Star Wars: Clone Wars</em> cartoon and her animated adventures continued on with <em>Star Wars: Rebels</em> before finally appearing as live action in season two of <em>The Mandalorian</em> and the first season of <em>The Book of Boba Fett.</em></p><p>Ahsoka is played by Rosario Dawson and it seems the show will be a pseudo-sequel to <em>Rebels,</em> with many characters from that show appearing in live action for the first time. Natasha Liu Bordizzo stars as Sabine Wren, Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays Hera Syndulla and Eman Esfandi appears as Ezra Bridger. Also, notorious franchise villain Grand Admiral Thrawn will make his live action debut, still portrayed by Lars Mikkelsen.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="45db26d0243348d09b5817293e2e220c"></div><p>The remaining cast includes David Tennant, Diana Lee Inosanto and the recently-deceased Ray Stevenson. There are also plenty of rumors that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-play-ahsoka-hayden-christensen-095105982.html"><ins>Hayden Christensen will return</ins></a> as Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader. For the uninitiated, Ahsoka Tano was Skywalker’s pupil before he started executing Jedi Padawans and blowing up entire planets.</p><p>Disney+ has dropped a new trailer for the show that will air on TV tonight during the NBA Finals Game 3. Most of the footage here was <a href="https://money.yahoo.com/star-wars-ahsokas-first-trailer-113800666.html"><ins>already available in the previous trailer,</ins></a> but there are a few new shots here and there. The entire show is being written by franchise co-steward Dave Filoni, who originally created the character for <em>Clone Wars.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/star-wars-ahsoka-premieres-august-23rd-on-disney-172944306.html?src=rss

## How to understand the Air Quality Index

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/air-quality/"><ins>Air quality</ins></a> levels in parts of Canada and the US have nosedived in recent days as winds have carried smoke from wildfires in Quebec and Nova Scotia across the continent. Things are bad enough that New York City was deemed to have <a href="https://qz.com/canadian-wildfire-smoke-has-given-new-york-the-worst-ai-1850513614"><ins>the worst air quality</ins></a> of any major city in the world.</p><p>Several states and cities have issued advisories urging people to stay inside if possible to avoid the dangers of unhealthy air quality. Jurisdictions are typically basing their decisions on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/epa/"><ins>Environmental Protection Agency’s</ins></a> Air Quality Index (AQI). Metro areas with a population of more than 350,000 have to report air quality data on a daily basis, while other locales simply do so as a public service.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The AQI <a href="https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/using-air-quality-index/"><ins>measures air quality</ins></a> based on five major pollutants that the Clean Air Act regulates: ozone, particle pollution (AKA particulate matter or PM2.5), carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide. The EPA also typically issues AQI forecasts for the next day each afternoon. With smoke pollution from wildfires, particulate matter is the primary air quality concern.</p><p>The EPA likens the AQI to a weather forecast that can help you plan outdoor activities. There are a couple things to keep in mind, however. For one thing, the AQI isn't fully transparent on which pollutant is the biggest contributing factor to its values at a given time. The EPA uses a formula to calculate AQI values — it doesn't simply add up the impact of each pollutant.</p><p>The AQI <a href="https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/"><ins>uses a scale</ins></a> that typically ranges from zero to 500 to denote air quality. If your area has an AQI of 50 or below, you're in a green zone. You should have good air quality and little or no risk from pollution.</p><p>When the index reaches a value of between 51 and 100, that's a code yellow, which is moderate cause for concern. The EPA says that in this range, air quality is acceptable, but there may be a health risk for some people, such as folks who are &quot;unusually sensitive to air pollution.&quot;</p><p>When the index is between 101 and 150, that's when the air quality may start to impact &quot;members of sensitive groups.&quot; These include people with heart or lung disease, older adults, children, pregnant people and those who spend a great deal of time outdoors. However, the general public is less likely to be affected in orange zones, the EPA says.</p><figure><img alt="A woman jogs with a dog along the Hudson River shortly after sunrise, as haze and smoke caused by wildfires in Canada hang over the Manhattan skyline, in New York City, New York, U.S., June 7, 2023. REUTERS/Mike Segar" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/36272910-0551-11ee-bfbd-7971acf6f3f0" style="height: 2472px; width: 3879px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mike Segar / reuters</div></figure><p>The AQI will reach a code red when the index value surpasses 151. &quot;Some members of the general public may experience health effects; members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects,&quot; according to the EPA.</p><p>Between 201 to 300, the AQI is at code purple. This denotes a health alert, the agency says. There's an increased risk of negative health effects for everyone. Once the index reaches 301, the AQI will be at a code maroon. That means the air quality is hazardous and constitutes a “health warning of emergency conditions” as everyone is more likely to be affected.</p><p>At code orange, the EPA recommends that everyone keeps outdoor activities light and short and for sensitive groups to go inside if they're experiencing symptoms. In red zones, everyone is encouraged to stay indoors if they have symptoms, while sensitive groups might consider moving all activities indoors.</p><p>When the AQI reaches code purple, sensitive groups are advised to avoid all outdoor physical activity, and others should limit outdoor activities. In maroon areas, everyone should stay inside. It's possible for PM2.5 levels to go above an AQI value of 500, in which case you should <a href="https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/extremely-high-levels-of-pm25/"><ins>take extra precautions and steps to protect yourself</ins></a>.</p><p>Fine particles from smoke can cause issues such as burning eyes, runny noses and conditions like bronchitis, according to the EPA. The particles may aggravate chronic heart and lung diseases too. The agency says those who are advised to stay indoors due to smoke pollution should try to keep the air as clean as possible inside. It suggests avoiding using anything that burns (such as gas stoves, wood fireplaces and candles) or vacuuming, since this can stir up particles that are already inside your residence.&nbsp;</p><p>If you have an air conditioner, you should run it with the air intake closed and the filter clean, the EPA says. Those who absolutely have to go outdoors might find it helpful to wear a mask that can help filter out particulate matter.</p><p><a href="https://fire.airnow.gov/"><ins>An interactive map</ins></a> shows AQI levels across the US, Canada and parts of Central America. At the time of writing, some areas of New York, Pennsylvania and Ontario are at a code maroon and have hazardous air quality, according to the EPA. Many other regions are under red and purple alerts.</p><figure><img alt="A screenshot of the EPA's AirNow Fire and Smoke map." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/1afcb410-0552-11ee-b9a3-29ed74de9b26" style="height: 1080px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">EPA</div></figure><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/how-to-understand-the-air-quality-index-165633539.html?src=rss

## Scientists develop remote-controlled pill-shaped camera to diagnose digestive issues

<p>Ingestible video capsule endoscopes <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-02-04-fda-approves-pillcam-colon-colonoscopy.html">have been around for a while,</a> but they’re severely limited and not controllable by physicians, relying entirely on gravity and the digestive system for movement. Researchers may have just gotten around that limitation by developing a pill-shaped capsule that allows for remote control, as announced by the <a href="https://mediarelations.gwu.edu/tiny-video-capsule-shows-promise-alternative-endoscopy">GW School of Medicine &amp; Health Sciences.</a></p><p>This tech lets physicians quite literally drive a miniature video capsule, called the NaviCam, throughout the digestive system to visualize and photograph potential problem areas, offering a potential alternative to the traditional endoscopy. It uses an external magnet and video game style joysticks for movement.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“A traditional endoscopy is an invasive procedure for patients, not to mention it is costly due to the need for anesthesia and time off work,” Andrew Meltzer, a professor of Emergency Medicine at the GW School of Medicine &amp; Health Sciences, said. “Magnetically controlled capsules could be used as a quick and easy way to screen for health problems in the upper GI tract such as ulcers or stomach cancer.”</p><p>This technology is still in the testing phase though results have been positive. Meltzer and colleagues at medical technology company AnX Robotica conducted a 40-person study and found that doctors could accurately control the capsule to all major parts of the stomach with a 95 percent rate of successful visualization. These patients also underwent a traditional endoscopy to confirm that the camera didn’t miss any high-risk lesions.</p><div id="undefined"></div><p>The potential benefits for patients are varied, as the camera’s designed to pick up bleeding, inflammation, and lesions. It can also automatically transmit videos and images off-site for further review. The <a href="https://www.igiejournal.org/article/S2949-7086(23)00052-3/fulltext">official study indicates</a> that using a camera capsule offers no health risks, though the tech doesn’t allow for biopsies, as it degrades inside of the body. Researchers note this pilot testing program is still in the beginning stages and a “much bigger trial with more patients” is on the horizon.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/scientists-develop-remote-controlled-pill-shaped-camera-to-diagnose-digestive-issues-164544887.html?src=rss

<p>With its seal broken by the release of ChatGPT last November, generative AI has erupted into mainstream society with a ferocity not seen since Pandora’s famous misadventure with the misery box. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chatgpt-is-suddenly-everywhere-are-we-ready-180031821.html">The technology is suddenly everywhere</a>, with startups and industry leaders alike scrambling to tack this smart feature du jour onto their existing code stacks and shoehorn the transformational promise of machine-generated content into their every app. At this point in the hype cycle you’d be a fool <em>not</em> to shout your genAI accomplishments from the rooftops; it’s quickly become the only way to be heard above the din from all the customizable chatbot and self-producing Powerpoint slide sellers flooding the market.</p><p>If <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-io-2023-everything-announced-at-the-event-193758196.html">Google’s latest I/O conference</a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-is-working-on-ai-personas-for-instagram-messenger-and-whatsapp-223316961.html">Meta’s new dedicated development team</a> were any indication, the tech industry’s biggest players are also getting ready to go all in on genAI. Google’s event was focused on the company’s AI ambitions surrounding Bard and PaLM 2, perhaps even to the detriment of the announced hardware including the Pixel Fold and 7a phones, and Pixel Tablet. From Gmail’s Smart Compose features to Camera’s Real Tone and Magic Editor, <a href="https://sherlock.scribblelive.com/r?u=https://www.engadget.com/googles-project-tailwind-is-an-ai-infused-personal-notebook-182728079.html&amp;p=73d42a20-04b5-11ee-ad9f-c3a60acc0379&amp;c=18595&amp;e=3031940">Project Tailwind</a> to the 7a’s generative wallpapers, AI was first on the lips of every Alphabet executive to take the Shoreline stage.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you’d been drinking two fingers every time Apple mentioned it during its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-wwdc-2023-live-updates-160004876.html">WWDC 2023 keynote</a>, however, you’d be stone sober.</p><p>Zero — that’s the number of times that an on-stage presenter uttered the phrase “artificial intelligence” at WWDC 2023. The nearest we got to AI was 'Air' and the term “machine learning” was said exactly seven times. I know because I had a chatbot count for me.</p><p>That’s not to say Apple isn’t investing heavily into AI research and development. The products on display during Tuesday’s keynote were chock full of the tech. The “ducking autocorrect” features are empowered by on-device machine learning, as are the Lock Screen live video (which uses it to synthesize interstitial frames) and the new Journal app’s inspirational personalized writing prompts. The PDF autofill features rely on machine vision systems to understand which fields go where — the Health Apps’ new myopia test does too, just with your kid’s screen distance — while AirPods now tailor your playback settings based on your preferences <em>and</em> prevailing environmental conditions. All thanks to machine learning systems.</p><p>It's just, Apple didn’t talk about it. At least, not directly.</p><p>Even when discussing the cutting-edge features in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-vision-pro-hands-on-a-new-milestone-for-mixed-reality-060943291.html">new Vision Pro headset</a> — whether it’s the natural language processing that goes into its voice inputs, audio ray tracing, the machine-vision black magic or that real-time hand gesture tracking and Optic ID entail — the discussion remained centered on what the headset features can do for users. Not what the headset could do for the state of the art or the race for market superiority.</p><p>The closest Apple got during the event to openly describing the digital nuts and bolts that constitute its machine learning systems was its description of the Vision Pro’s Persona feature. With the device’s applications skewing hard toward gaming, entertainment and communication, there was never a chance that we’d get through this without having to make FaceTime calls with these strapped to our heads. Since a FaceTime call where everybody is hidden behind a headset would defeat the purpose of having a video call, Apple is instead leveraging a complex machine learning system to digitally recreate the Vision Pro wearer’s head, torso, arms and hands — otherwise known as their “Persona.”</p><p>“After a quick enrollment process using the front sensors on vision pro, the system uses an advanced encoder decoder, neural network to create your digital persona,” Mike Rockwell, VP of Apple’s Technology Development Group, said during the event. “This network was trained on a diverse group of thousands of individuals, it delivers a natural representation which dynamically matches your facial and hand movement.”</p><p>AI was largely treated as an afterthought throughout the event rather than a selling point, much to Apple’s benefit. In breaking from the carnival-like atmosphere currently surrounding generative AI developments, Apple not only maintains its aloof and elite branding, it also distances itself from Google’s aggressive promotion of the technology, and also eases skittish would-be buyers into the joys of face-mounted hardware.</p><p>Steve Jobs often used the phrase “it just works” to describe the company’s products — implying that they were meant to solve problems, not create additional hassle for users — and it would appear that Apple has rekindled that design philosophy at the dawn of the spatial computing era. In our increasingly dysfunctional, volatile and erratic society, the promise of simplicity and reliability, of something, <em>anything,</em> working as advertised, could be just what Apple needs to get buyers to swallow the Vision Pro’s $3,600 asking price.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/where-was-all-the-ai-at-wwdc-163048564.html?src=rss

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/e3-2023-has-been-canceled-211201976.html"><ins>E3 is canceled</ins></a> this year due to both the pandemic’s effects on development schedules and the success of events elsewhere in the year, like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-morning-after-all-the-big-news-from-the-game-awards-including-hades-ii-death-stranding-2-idris-elba-121556862.html"><ins>The Game Awards</ins></a>. As such, expectations are higher than ever for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/summer-game-fest-in-person-show-date-e3-193242912.html"><ins>Summer Game Fest</ins></a> (SGF). It’s now the biggest mid-year opportunity for developers to reveal new games and hype up their upcoming releases. At the same time, you might not see absolutely everyone. Don’t worry if it’s all a bit overwhelming — we’ll let you know how to watch, and what you’ll likely see when Geoff Keighley and partner studios take to the stage.</p><h2>Who’s coming to Summer Game Fest</h2><h2></h2><div id="79d321b078b94b289a7e9121b0ffc994"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><h2></h2><p>Most major game developers <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1656705727971328000"><ins>will attend</ins></a> Summer Game Fest in some capacity. Former E3 mainstays Activision, EA, Microsoft, Sony and Ubisoft will be there. You can also expect well-known studios and technology companies like Amazon Games, Bandai Namco, CD Projekt Red, Capcom, Epic Games, Gearbox, Netflix, Razer, Samsung and Valve.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Keighley’s team hasn’t shared many specifics of what to expect, but there have been a couple of clues.You should see the first gameplay footage from the fighting series reboot <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mortal-kombat-1-reboots-the-series-on-september-19th-132434266.html"><em><ins>Mortal Kombat 1</ins></em></a>, while Remedy should show more of its action horror sequel <a href="https://www.engadget.com/alan-wake-ii-will-drop-on-october-17th-for-xbox-series-x-ps5-and-pc-210405566.html"><em><ins>Alan Wake II</ins></em></a>. We also wouldn’t be surprised if CD Projekt Red showed more of its <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> add-on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cd-projekt-red-cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-paid-dlc-131510675.html"><em><ins>Phantom Liberty</ins></em></a> given promises of news this month.</p><p>Don’t expect a dedicated PlayStation event at SGF. Sony held a Showcase livestream on May 24th that showcased much of what the company and its partners are working on, including the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/project-q-is-a-dedicated-ps5-streaming-device-due-later-this-year-211814445.html"><ins>Project Q</ins></a> handheld streaming device and Konami’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater-is-being-remade-for-modern-platforms-204716222.html"><em><ins>Metal Gear Solid 3</ins></em><ins> remake</ins></a>.

Double Fine and iam8bit are holding their customary “Day of the Devs” indie game presentation at 5PM Eastern on the 8th. Devolver, meanwhile, is streaming its announcements at 6PM.

## Google's Bard AI is getting better at programming

<p>It seems like there’s a new update announced every day in the ongoing race to have the most advanced AI. The latest comes courtesy of Google, which is launching<a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/bard-improved-reasoning-google-sheets-export"> further improvements to Bard</a>, including better advanced reasoning and math abilities.&nbsp;</p><p>Bard will no longer rely solely on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ai-presents-risk-of-extinction-on-par-with-nuclear-war-industry-leaders-say-114025874.html">LLMs</a>, which are best for predictions versus solving complex problems. Instead, it should now identify when further processing could help and then generate background code to improve correctness. According to Google, this update boosted computation-based word and math problems’ accuracy across their internal challenge datasets by 30 percent.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Google claims Bard should be able to provide information such as the prime factors of numbers in the millions, the growth rate of your savings and what words like “lollipop” look like backward (<em>because that will undoubtedly convince </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/godfather-of-ai-leaves-google-amid-ethical-concerns-152451800.html"><em>AI naysayers</em></a><em> that it’s the ultimate tool</em>). The company, itself, gives a standard disclaimer explaining, “Bard won’t always get it right — for example, Bard might not generate code to help the prompt response, the code it generates might be wrong or Bard may not include the executed code in its response.”&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to integrating code generation, Google has also announced a function that allows allows data that Bard produces to be editable and manipulated in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-is-shoving-generative-ai-into-gmail-docs-sheets-meet-chat-and-slides-161711903.html">Sheets</a>. It’s a minor update, but one people who hate spreadsheets will undoubtedly appreciate. It’s a minor update, but one that will take some of the stress out of building and maintaining spreadsheets.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/googles-bard-ai-is-getting-better-at-programming-160034882.html?src=rss

## The best outdoor gift ideas for dad

<p>Porches, decks, patios, balconies, terraces. Places for dads to find solace from the world around them. Those spots, and backyards overall, are excellent places to cook a meal, have a drink or simply relax. We’ve compiled a list of the best backyard gear for dads this Father’s Day, from smart grills and pizza ovens to fire pits and drinkware. There’s something that can help all dads enjoy a little time outside.</p><h2>Thermacell EL55</h2><p></p><p>When it comes to portable mosquito repellers, Thermacell’s gear is a favorite amongst the Engadget staff. The company’s newest model, the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9UaGVybWFjZWxsLVJlY2hhcmdlYWJsZS1Qcm90ZWN0aW9uLVJlcGVsbGVudC1BbHRlcm5hdGl2ZS9kcC9CMEJTMjlRTkJDP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWg0LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3NmU5OTQxZS04MDgyLTQwMWQtYWFjZS00MWQ3OTUzNTE2OTYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVUmDNrWiwRh97AubQfNHpJos5gCkMKI04aL1yFjmyBb&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FThermacell-Rechargeable-Protection-Repellent-Alternative%2Fdp%2FB0BS29QNBC">EL55</a>, is much like the E55 we previously selected. The main difference is the addition of a dimmable light for use after dark. The EL55 will last up to nine hours on a charge with the light off, or up to five and a half hours with it on. Like other recent Thermacell products, the EL55 uses liquid cartridges to offer scentless protection for a 20-foot radius.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Marshall Emberton II</h2><p></p><p>A speaker that looks like a guitar amp might be the perfect option for dads.

With up to 30 hours of listening time and a “Stack Mode” for pairing it with other speakers, there’s plenty to like here. Expect balanced sound with plenty of low-end tone in a unit that can blast tunes 360 degrees.</p><h2>Meater+ thermometer</h2><p></p><p>Maybe dad doesn’t need a new grill, but could use some help perfecting his skills or would enjoy monitoring food from afar. <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9NRUFURVItVGhlcm1vbWV0ZXItUm90aXNzZXJpZS1CbHVldG9vdGgtQ29ubmVjdGl2aXR5L2RwL0IwN0g4V1RGSFc_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8taDQtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijc2ZTk5NDFlLTgwODItNDAxZC1hYWNlLTQxZDc5NTM1MTY5NiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAcpMEJJn_nLOolrS4plcYbHrOdRdkQD5uNoXhNDtrtgU&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMEATER-Thermometer-Rotisserie-Bluetooth-Connectivity%2Fdp%2FB07H8WTFHW">Meater+</a> is a wireless probe that sends food and ambient temperature readings to your phone via Bluetooth.

There are a few different models, but I prefer the Trio’s 3-in-1 abilities. For 16 ounce cans, it’s an insulated aluminum holder. For 12 ounce cans, the Hopsulator comes with a reusable cold puck for even more efficient cooling. And as I mentioned, it comes with a lid so you can use it as a cup if you want.

## Ace Championship is more than just a Formula E feeder series

<p>“There’s nothing in between.”</p><p><a href="https://www.ace-championship.com/">Ace Championship</a> founder and CEO Dilbagh Gill is explaining the motivation behind building another all-electric racing series. Gill, who was CEO and team principal of Mahindra Racing since Formula E began, left his post last year to embark on something new. His project is one that had been “fermenting” in his mind for a year and a half. “I always thought there had to be a credible ladder in the electric racing series,” he said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Gill explained that while traditional, combustion-engine racing has had a development path for decades, there’s nothing currently that exists between electric karting and FIA world championships like Formula E. “It’s not something we’re trying to reinvent,” he said. “We’re just trying to take the ladder the other direction.”</p><p>A major hurdle for young drivers climbing the ranks in motorsport is cost. It’s not enough for a driver to be quick, they need the financial backing as well. So, in addition to creating a new training ground for future champions, Ace is also working to reduce the barrier to entry when it comes to the cost of equipment. “They have the talent, but they don’t have the opportunity,” Gill noted. “Let’s try and make a championship which can be more inclusive than motorsport is today.”</p><p>Ace Championship isn’t just hoping to develop a new crop of drivers each season. The series will also offer opportunities for ages 15-25 who are interested in engineering, communications, marketing and other aspects of motorsport to get real-world experience. Gill said that during his eight years in England at the reins of Mahindra Racing, guest lectures opened his eyes to the fact that nearly 30 percent of university students in motorsport disciplines were from Asia. “What are they going to do next?” he asked himself. “Could something like [Ace] help them find a path?” Gill further explained that Ace would offer a scholarship program to reduce the financial burden even more. “Some talented folks who can’t afford getting in, we will be supporting them,” he said.</p><p>As a means of lowering costs, teams will be able to run four drivers with two cars. In most current series, each driver has their own vehicle – hence the high cost to participate. Ace Challenger will be the series’ entry-level format, meant for drivers who found success in karting and are looking for an academy experience. Here, races will run at reduced power so that drivers can acclimate to the car as well as learn about “technique, technology and collaborating with engineers.” Ace Championship is the higher level that runs the cars at increased power output. The focus shifts from the basics to things like detailed race strategy and energy management – two key elements for Formula E and other series.</p><div id="bb04d22ad6c741e8b8b0290653a8759e"></div><p>To further level the playing field, Ace will keep all of the cars at its so-called Powerpark. “We don’t want the cars going back to their garages to start getting modified,” Gill explained. “We want to keep them in a controlled environment.” He also emphasized the importance of building the facilities in Asia. “We think Asia is going to be the melting pot [for electric racing],” he said. “From there, we are within five hours of flying to three or four regions.”</p><p>Serving as the series HQ, the campus will offer simulators for each team as well as classroom training on topics like telemetry, working with engineers and social media management. Preparation will be key because the currently proposed format would have each team traveling for around 10 weeks before returning to Powerpark. This means they’ll have to devise strategies for each circuit before they depart since there won’t be simulators to train on while they’re on the road.</p><p>With the new championship, Gill and his colleagues are also designing a completely new all-electric racer for the series. When Ace <a href="https://www.engadget.com/former-formula-e-team-lead-announces-new-electric-motorsport-racing-series-234029615.html">was first announced</a> at the Hyderabad E-Prix in February, Gill showed off a prototype vehicle that was built from a Formula E Gen2 chassis. However, the car the series will use won’t just be modified leftovers from the previous generation forever.</p><p>“After eight years at Mahindra Racing, when I left, they gave me a Gen2 car,” Gill said. “So that was an easy acquisition of a prototype – my personal car.”</p><p>Ace is currently working to build a brand new chassis, which Gill explained won’t “use anything that exists on the market.” The reason for this, he noted, is that the custom-made cars will run a front powertrain kit and no existing chassis can integrate it “without a lot of work.” The current plan is to have the new cars ready for the third year of the championship, which should begin in 2024. Gill said Ace aims to use its initial design for six years before an anticipated upgrade. Both the Challenger and the Championship series will use the same car with some physical differences – like slight variations to the nose kit and rims. Power output can be controlled by software, which will allow a team’s four drivers to use just the two cars.</p><p>Another key element of the car’s design will be LED lighting. Formula E uses lights around the halo of its cars to indicate things like Attack Mode. The Ace Championship aims to make things a bit more dynamic here, with color changes for things like when the driver is accelerating, when a car is regenerating energy through braking or when the driver is coasting. Ace also wants to take a page from the Tour de France and use the LEDs to point out the leader. Gill said the lights could also indicate the driver in P1 as well as green and purple sectors in qualifying or the driver with the current fastest lap. “We have to figure it out,” he admits, but the lights could be a simple way to make races more informative for fans and they’ll undoubtedly provide a unique look during night events.</p><p>The series is also exploring the possibility of using two different tire compounds for Ace Challenger and Ace Championship, “so that drivers can understand the different nuances,” according to Gill. He floated the idea that there’s a tire with a smaller performance window for the Challenger series so that you have to bring it to a peak and manage it the rest of the way. And for the Championship, perhaps the tire is “a bit more forgiving… so you can push it without much degradation.” Gill enlisted former Formula 1 and Mahindra Formula E driver Nick Heidfeld to work with tire manufacturers on the various compounds and Ace already has a prototype that it’s currently testing.</p><figure><img alt="Ace Championship" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/654583e0-04cf-11ee-b55f-fc9a87eb9d54" /><figcaption>The current Ace Championship prototype based on a Formula E Gen2 car</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Ace Championship</div></figure><p>At the end of the day, Gill envisions having a car that’s within three to three and a half seconds of the performance of a Formula E car. “The steps are smaller,” he explained. “New people coming to Formula E, especially on the drivers side, it takes a long time for them to get adapted.” The overall idea is for the Ace Championship cars to offer drivers a translatable experience to Formula E in the way Formula 2 does for Formula 1. “This step up from our championship isn’t where a [driver] will struggle for a year,” he said. Drivers who are new to Formula E may be quick over one lap, but variables like tire and energy management can be very challenging for the uninitiated.</p><p>“We believe tire and energy management is going to be valuable across all forms of motorsport,” Gill proclaimed. Internal combustion engines have hybrid components in series like Formula 1, and drivers and engineers must learn how to manage and deploy that energy properly during a race. That is amplified in Formula E where you start the race with less energy than it takes to finish. Teams rely on the drivers’ ability to regenerate the difference on track, as well as their strategy for managing consumption on each lap. And, of course, being able to go quick without using up your tires is a valuable skill for any racing discipline.</p><p>The Ace Championship plans to schedule races in four different regions: East Asia, Southwest Asia, The Americas and Europe and Africa. During its first two years, the series will only travel to two of those areas with the goal of expanding in 2026. Grouping races like this allows Ace to eliminate the cost of flying teams around the world between events. Racing in each region could take place over the span of a quarter, with the aim of having a new set of drivers each time. While the series hosts its first events in 2024 and 2025, it will also be building a second set of cars. Gill explained that Ace wants to have enough vehicles to have regional events take place while the others are back at Powerpark getting refurbished for the following quarter.</p><p>Scheduling is wide open at this point, though. Gill admitted a regional championship may have to be condensed into three weeks so Ace can “synchronize” with the Formula E calendar that runs from January to July. The goal here is to do tandem events with the FIA-sanctioned global EV championship, taking place around the E-Prix during the same weekend, even though it may only be one Ace category due to the time and logistics of street circuits. Again, it’s much like Formula 2 does at some Formula 1 races. Not only will piggybacking off Formula E events provide visibility for the series, but it will give young drivers and support staff a glimpse of how things are done at the next level.</p><p>Other Ace races will be standalone, including two of the six events during a regional championship being doubleheaders on back-to-back days. Gill said the current idea is for the independent races to take place on small circuits. Each regional schedule will serve as its own championship, so at the end of the first year, there will be four winners – two from each Ace category.</p><p>The ultimate prize for the Ace Championship is to train drivers, race engineers, mechanics and other members of a motorsport team who move on to FIA disciplines like the World Endurance Championship, Formula 2 or Formula 1. And that by doing so, they’re establishing a talent pool across all of those areas ready to contribute to the success of a world championship team.</p><p>“Our goal is to make world champions in the next five years,” Gill said.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ace-championship-is-more-than-just-a-formula-e-feeder-series-153018295.html?src=rss

<p>It’s not always easy (or affordable) to wrangle kids together for a trip to the cinema. And for new parents, it’s often tough to find childcare for a date night. A better option for dads and moms is a home entertainment upgrade – something that can help them relax once the kids are asleep, or to have a fun family movie night. Here are some of our favorite gift options to elevate any parent’s viewing experience.</p><h2>Sonos Beam</h2><p></p><p>There are plenty of soundbars out there, but few are as versatile as the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1e71dc69-0ad7-47e7-abf5-dc3926557fa3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sonos&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIxZTcxZGM2OS0wYWQ3LTQ3ZTctYWJmNS1kYzM5MjY1NTdmYTMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc29ub3MuY29tL2VuLXVzL3Nob3AvYmVhbSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzFhM2I0ZjgtNjQwZS00MjEwLWJkNDAtM2ViZDVkZTQwODQxIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAfdPHlZlknPWDIm1eDDDU0RJE4hR7UrXy_sHnATXDBbl&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fbeam">Sonos Beam</a>. It's a sleek box that'll instantly upgrade any TV with expansive and detailed sound<em>. But,</em> it's also a smart speaker with support for Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. That makes it a viable alternative to devices like the Echo. Being able to shout "Play some Sesame Street songs!" comes in really handy for new parents. Trust me.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>LG C2 OLED</h2><p></p><p>There’s no better home entertainment upgrade than a new TV, and <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDlSTUxMSlBYLz90aD0xJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTExeS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzFhM2I0ZjgtNjQwZS00MjEwLWJkNDAtM2ViZDVkZTQwODQxIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAd5z9vqV-66FJrajduhTxYDCb7Wbiw8fV_eqQbPtuiyM&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09RMLLJPX%2F%3Fth%3D1">LG’s C2</a>, like the company’s previous flagship OLEDs, remains one of the best. It’ll deliver astounding 4K HDR and Dolby Vision content, with all of the eye-searing contrast and inky blacks you’d expect from an OLED panel. While LG has a newer C3 model, we think the C2 remains a better option for most people, especially since it costs far less.</p><h2>PlayStation 5 Media Remote</h2><p></p><p>If your entertainment runs through a game console, and dad just wants to kick back to watch a game or some Blu-ray discs, then he’ll appreciate navigating things with a remote instead of a gamepad. The <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9NZWRpYS1SZW1vdGUtUGxheVN0YXRpb24tNS9kcC9CMDhGQzVSNEtWP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTExeS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzFhM2I0ZjgtNjQwZS00MjEwLWJkNDAtM2ViZDVkZTQwODQxIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAXd1ZVbx1lFR3pURb_Z12teOwIlrXsjUCRJ8ZGIkFdJf&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMedia-Remote-PlayStation-5%2Fdp%2FB08FC5R4KV">PS5 Media Remote</a> matches the console aesthetically, and includes shortcut buttons for several popular apps. Plus, its batteries will last longer than the one in a DualSense so it will always be ready to go. Your biggest problem could be probably finding one in stock, although if you managed to snag the console then we think you’ll be able to figure this out too. For Xbox owners, the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2Ftem4udG8vM0drM0loUiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzFhM2I0ZjgtNjQwZS00MjEwLWJkNDAtM2ViZDVkZTQwODQxIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAeZ-0Cs3aMjQy80YY2tJQ_FGtlLvV1zWnpn6XJHe0FVJ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Famzn.to%2F3Gk3IhR">PDP Media remote</a> works for systems from the One through the new Series X/S. Instead of shortcut keys it includes a fairly standard universal remote setup so that there’s not a lot of re-learning involved.</p><h2>Roku Streaming Stick 4K</h2><p></p><p>Anyone with an older TV set would appreciate <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Sb2t1LVN0cmVhbWluZy1EZXZpY2UtVmlzaW9uLUNvbnRyb2xzL2RwL0IwOUJLQ0RYWkMvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTExeS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzFhM2I0ZjgtNjQwZS00MjEwLWJkNDAtM2ViZDVkZTQwODQxIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAVXqptoBhfxW5DlSYjp3En9lgoBnc5yy3g9XDhIUJHrI&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FRoku-Streaming-Device-Vision-Controls%2Fdp%2FB09BKCDXZC%2F">Roku’s Streaming Stick 4K</a>. It’s a $50 dongle that’ll do just about everything you’d want from a streaming device: Access a vast library of apps, offer fast performance and play content in 4K (and on supported TVs, it can also handle HDR and Dolby Vision). Even if a TV already has built-in apps, there’s a good chance the Streaming Stick will be faster, especially if the set is a few years old. Roku’s stick also makes for a great travel companion: Instead of logging into services on a hotel TV, dad just needs to plug this in.</p><h2>Apple TV 4K 2022</h2><p></p><p>The latest version of the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMEJKTUdCOTVKLz90aD0xJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTExeS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzFhM2I0ZjgtNjQwZS00MjEwLWJkNDAtM2ViZDVkZTQwODQxIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAS8WeEY8ZZtfRPhxeSHKHrPbtae2OU7_odTNpAOgyWhZ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BJMGB95J%2F%3Fth%3D1">Apple TV 4K</a> is, unsurprisingly, the best. It’s faster than ever, it’s far more affordable and it includes Apple’s revamped Siri Remote, which has a responsive (and clickable) circular trackpad. The new version is a solid upgrade for anyone with the original 4K model, and it’s even a bigger leap for owners of the company’s older set-top boxes. Sure, Apple’s TV app is also available on many competing devices, but we still prefer the user experience of the Apple TV 4K. Consider it a must buy for any iPhone-toting parents in your life.</p><h2>Sony WH-1000XM5</h2><p></p><p>Sony’s latest pair of noise-canceling headphones are among the best we’ve ever seen. The <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Tb255LVdILTEwMDBYTTUtQ2FuY2VsaW5nLUhlYWRwaG9uZXMtSGFuZHMtRnJlZS9kcC9CMDlYU0RNVDRGLz90aD0xJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTExeS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzFhM2I0ZjgtNjQwZS00MjEwLWJkNDAtM2ViZDVkZTQwODQxIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAT27QTcisAh99VFbf4t7MJ0cE1SzSSY-b9SHZ5eEj-hX&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSony-WH-1000XM5-Canceling-Headphones-Hands-Free%2Fdp%2FB09XSDMT4F%2F%3Fth%3D1">XM5</a> are supremely comfortable, offer excellent sound quality, and have far more powerful noise-blocking capabilities than before. While they’re not great for group watching, they’re the perfect pair of cans for a new dad who wants to fully immerse themselves in the latest <em>Fast and Furious</em> movie.</p><h2>Philips Hue White + Color Starter Kit</h2><p></p><p>Whether the house is already leaning into automation or not, this starter kit of <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9QaGlsaXBzLUh1ZS1TdGFydGVyLUNvbXBhdGlibGUtQXNzaXN0YW50L2RwL0IwOTVLUVNYWUg_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMTF5LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzMWEzYjRmOC02NDBlLTQyMTAtYmQ0MC0zZWJkNWRlNDA4NDEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAYXjh8DsHhl6rSfREjHILykRppI74t6DFhu_lkWFg87_&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPhilips-Hue-Starter-Compatible-Assistant%2Fdp%2FB095KQSXYH">Philips Hue White and Color lights</a> should be a good fit. It comes with three bulbs that can glow in millions of colors, as well as a button for easy manual control and a Hue bridge. The latter will be important if dad eventually wants to add to its lighting system as it supports up to 50 connected lights. He’ll be able to control his lights from anywhere using the companion mobile app, set schedules and routines and use Alexa, Google Assistant or Siri commands to change the lighting in the house as he sees fit. That means it’ll be easier than ever for dad to get the right ambiance for his next movie night.</p><h2>BenQ HT2050AA projector</h2><p></p><p>For the biggest and best screen possible, you’ll always want a projector.

## Meta vows to take action after report found Instagram’s algorithm promoted pedophilia content

<p>Meta has set up an internal task force after reporters and researchers discovered its systems helped "connect and promote a vast network of accounts" devoted to underage-sex content, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2f007401-3eaa-4237-b69b-54ccbe125502&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Wall+Street+Journal&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyZjAwNzQwMS0zZWFhLTQyMzctYjY5Yi01NGNjYmUxMjU1MDIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9pbnN0YWdyYW0tdmFzdC1wZWRvcGhpbGUtbmV0d29yay00YWI3MTg5P21vZD1kamVtYWxlcnRORVdTIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhMmRiMjg4Yi0xMDU5LTQyYWMtOTIwZi00OWM2YmM0OTgwNDAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAcb6k2fdY3bDZuS3fVxFqlGwQt-y7F29rX44uYP0DFDr&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Finstagram-vast-pedophile-network-4ab7189%3Fmod%3DdjemalertNEWS"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> has reported. Unlike forums and file transfer services, Instagram not only hosts such activities but promotes them via its algorithms. The company acknowledged enforcement problems and has taken actions including restricting its systems from recommending searches associated with sex abuse.&nbsp;</p><p>"Child exploitation is a horrific crime," Meta told the <em>WSJ</em> in a statement. "We’re continuously investigating ways to actively defend against this behavior."</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Along with the task force, Meta told reporters that it is working on blocking child sexual abuse material (CSAM) networks and taking steps to change its systems. In the last two years, it has taken down 27 pedophile networks and is working on removing more. It has blocked thousands of related hashtags (with millions of posts for some) and took action to prevent its systems from recommending CSAM-related terms. It's also trying to stop its systems from connecting potential abusers with each other.</p><p>However, the report should be a wakeup call for Meta, the company's former security chief Alex Stamos told the <em>WSJ</em>. "That a team of three academics with limited access could find such a huge network should set off alarms at Meta," he said, noting that the company far better tools than outside investigators to map CSAM networks. "I hope the company reinvests in human investigators."&nbsp;</p><p>Academics from Stanford's Internet Observatory and UMass's Rescue Lab were able to quickly find "large-scale communities promoting criminal sex abuse," according to the report. After creating test users and viewing a single account, they were immediately hit with "suggested for you" recommendations of possible CSAM sellers and buyers, along with accounts linking to off-platform content sites. Following just several recommendations caused the test accounts to be inundated with sex-abuse content.&nbsp;</p><p>“Instagram is an onramp to places on the internet where there’s more explicit child sexual abuse,” said UMass Rescue Lab director Brian Levine. The Stanford group also found that CSAM content is "particularly severe" on the site. "The most important platform for these networks of buyers and sellers seems to be Instagram."</p><p>Meta said the company actively seeks to remove such users, having taken down 490,000 accounts violating child safety policies in January alone. Its internal statistics show that child exploitation appears in less than one in 10 thousand posts, it added.&nbsp;</p><p>However, until queried by reporters, Instagram was allowing users to search terms that its own systems know may be associated with CSAM material. A pop-up screen warned users that "These results may contain images of child sexual abuse" that can cause "extreme harm" to children. However, it then allowed users to either "Get resources" or "See results anyway." The latter option has now been disabled, but Meta didn't respond when the <em>WSJ</em> asked why it was allowed in the first place.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, attempts by users to report child-sex content were often ignored by Instagram's algorithms. And Facebook's own efforts to exclude hashtags and terms were sometimes overridden by the systems, suggesting users try variations on the name. In testing, researchers found that viewing even one underage seller account caused the algorithm to recommend new ones. "Instagram’s suggestions were helping to rebuild the network that the platform’s own safety staff was in the middle of trying to dismantle."</p><p>A Meta spokesperson said it's currently building system to prevent such recommendations, but Levine said the time to act is now. "Pull the emergency brake. Are the economic benefits worth the harms to these children?" Engadget has reached out to Meta for comment.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/meta-vows-to-take-action-after-report-found-instagrams-algorithm-promoted-pedophilia-content-133343896.html?src=rss

<p>Wordpress is getting an AI writing assistant of its own called <a href="https://wordpress.com/blog/2023/06/06/introducing-jetpack-ai-assistant/">Jetpack AI</a>, and it's built into the content management system's editor. For Wordpress blogs hosted elsewhere, owners will still be able to access the tool through the Jetpack plugin. Like any other generative AI tool, Jetpack can spit out content based on the prompt users type in, whether it's a traditional article, a list or a table. The assistant can also switch the tone of the post, depending on what the user is going for: It could sound informative, optimistic, humorous or even sarcastic.&nbsp;</p><p>If the user wants to write their own post, they could still ask Jetpack for help. They could either make the tool generate a headline based on what they'd written or use it to automatically check their grammar or correct any spelling mistakes. And if they want to include a translation of their article, they can use Jetpack AI to quickly translate it into any of its 12 available languages, including Spanish, French and Korean. According to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/07/automattic-launches-an-ai-writing-assistant-for-wordpress/?tpcc=tcplustwitter"><em>TechCrunch</em></a>, Jetpack is free to use for all WordPress.com customers for the first 20 requests as sort of a free trial period. After that, users will have to pay $10 per month to be able to access the tool.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While Jetpack AI can be especially useful for people already using Wordpress, it's just one of the AI-powered writing tools that have recently popped up.

<p>After a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volvos-compact-electric-suv-will-be-called-the-ex30-090534679.html">few teases</a>, Volvo is finally revealing the EX30, its more affordable all-electric premium SUV. Designed to have the lowest carbon footprint of all its offerings, Volvo’s fourth EV brings the company’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volvo-will-go-all-electric-by-2030-and-move-all-sales-online-091653396.html">plan to go all-electric by 2030</a> one step closer to becoming a reality.&nbsp;</p><p>The EX30 includes all of Volvo’s typical safety features and an updated <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-02-09-volvo-xc90-t8-review.html">Park Pilot Assist</a> that will help you find parking spaces, along with getting into them. It also comes in five exterior colors and ambient light offerings inspired by Scandinavia, including a northern lights setting, with paired ambient soundscapes. It comes off more like what you’d get in a spa than a car, but as long as you don’t get too cozy while driving, it should be nice.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="ce1e0dc6a9d8415894a2a19e617b546b"></div><p>The EX30 is available as a Single Motor Extended Range or Twin Motor Performance. They charge from 10 to 80 percent in 26 and a half minutes, have 64 kWh of usable battery and 268 rear horsepower. Plus, there's 31.9 cubic feet of luggage space.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, where they differ: The Single Motor is real-wheel drive, offering an estimated range of 275 miles, going 0 to 60 in 5.1 seconds and with 253 lbs-ft of torque. The Twin Motor is all-wheel drive with a slightly shorter range at 265 miles, goes 0 to 60 in 3.6 seconds and has 400 lbs-ft of torque. Built with performance in mind, the Twin Motor delivers 154 more horsepower (a total of 422 HP) than its single motor sibling.</p><p>The Volvo EX30 is available for pre-order in the US starting at $34,950, with a cross-country variant launching next year. In a statement about the EX30’s release, Volvo’s chief executive Jim Rowan commented on the frequent financial barrier to buying an EV. “We know that price and cost of ownership is still one of the biggest challenges when people consider switching to an electric car,” he said. “With the Volvo EX30, we aim to bring premium, fully electric mobility to a much broader audience, helping to advance and speed up the transition to full electrification that our industry and society needs.”&nbsp;</p><p>The EX30 is significantly cheaper than Volvo’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/copy-of-volvos-c-40-recharge-is-a-solid-second-stab-at-an-ev-163057572.html">C40</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-16-volvo-xc40-ev-unveil.html">XC40 EVs</a> — both with a starting price around $55,000 and the upcoming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volvo-officially-reveals-the-ex90-ev-suv-its-safest-car-ever-144414196.html">EX90</a>, which Volvo says will be “under $80,000.”&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="Black car interior with navigation screen.

## The Morning After: iOS 17 offers better protection for unsolicited images

<p>Receiving an unsolicited image is an unpleasant experience at the best of times, and one that technology has made all too common. At WWDC, Apple announced iOS 17 will use an on-device machine learning model to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-ios-17-expands-protection-against-unsolicited-nudes-142425558.html"><ins>scan both images and videos for nudity</ins></a>. When detected, you’ll get a pop-up, telling you the system thinks the file may be inappropriate.</p><p>I wonder how much of this is a response to the practice of AirDropping inappropriate images to an unsuspecting person’s phone. One notable incident from 2022 saw a person removed from a flight after they had shared an image of themselves with other passengers. That AirDrop images have visible previews, too, currently makes it harder for people to avoid catching an eyeful.</p><p>– Dan Cooper</p><p><em>The Morning After isn’t just a</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/"><em> newsletter</em></a><em> –  it’s also a daily podcast.

As well as the Mario headsets, the startup was also supplying heads-up display gear for the US military.

## Reddit is reportedly cutting 5 percent of its workforce

<p>Reddit is going through a restructuring, and according to an email by company chief Steve Huffman as seen by <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2f007401-3eaa-4237-b69b-54ccbe125502&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Wall+Street+Journal&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyZjAwNzQwMS0zZWFhLTQyMzctYjY5Yi01NGNjYmUxMjU1MDIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9yZWRkaXQtaXMtY3V0dGluZy1hYm91dC01LW9mLWl0cy13b3JrZm9yY2UtYW5kLXNsb3dpbmctaGlyaW5nLWFtaWQtcmVzdHJ1Y3R1cmluZy02M2NmYWRlOT9tb2Q9ZTJ0d2QiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjU3MzYwMDIwLWU2ZTAtNGUxYi1hMTMzLWM2NTc1ZTgyODdmNSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAATJ-jVDyz-FX5BLZu_ywltSBTWE9Znu5C0LaeFABQybs&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Freddit-is-cutting-about-5-of-its-workforce-and-slowing-hiring-amid-restructuring-63cfade9%3Fmod%3De2twd"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>, one of the moves it's going to make is laying off 90 employees. That's around 5 percent of the company's current workforce with 2,000 employees.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, Reddit is slowing down hiring this year and reducing the intake of new workers to 100 from the 300 personnel it had originally planned. Apparently, the social network wants to focus on achieving its biggest goals, such as breaking even next year. Huffman reportedly wrote in the email that Reddit has "had a solid first half of the year," and that this restructuring will position it "to carry that momentum into the second half and beyond."</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This is but one of the moves Reddit is taking in an effort to earn money: Back in April, it also announced that it will <a href="https://www.engadget.com/reddit-will-charge-companies-for-api-access-citing-ai-training-concerns-184935783.html">start charging developers</a> for access to its API. The company made the decision just as the biggest players in tech got into generative AI, which is typically trained using data from the internet accessed via API. "[A]s a platform with one of the largest corpus of human-to-human conversations online, spanning the past 18 years, we have an obligation to our communities to be stewards of this content," the company <a href="https://www.redditinc.com/blog/2023apiupdates">said</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>While Reddit may have been looking to earn from large companies, even independent developers are affected by its decision. Christian Selig, the sole developer of Apollo for Reddit, said it would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/reddit-app-developer-says-the-sites-new-api-rules-will-cost-him-20-million-a-year-203911487.html">cost him $20 million</a> a year to keep his app running as is. Other third-party apps, such as Narwhal and Reddit is Fun, have already warned users that they can't afford paying for Reddit's API and will likely shut down. Dozens of subreddit communities across various topics are now <a href="https://www.engadget.com/reddit-communities-are-going-dark-to-protest-changes-that-would-hurt-third-party-apps-154133342.html">planning to go dark</a> starting on June 12th as an act of protest. Some of them plan to remain inactive for 48 hours, while others intend to stay dark permanently until Reddit addresses the issue.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/reddit-is-reportedly-cutting-5-percent-of-its-workforce-100556991.html?src=rss

Alexa can manage the doorbell by operating the two-way audio function, arming and disarming the device and giving you chime and motion alerts.

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-unpacked-2023-galaxy-s23-event-230050182.html">Samsung</a> has historically held Unpacked in various major cities around the world, starting with Las Vegas in 2010, but the company has yet to host the event in its home country's capital city. Now, the tech giant has announced that it's holding Unpacked in Seoul for the first time. It has no specific date yet, but it will take place in late July at COEX in Samseong-dong, Gangnam. Samsung says it will unveil its next-gen foldable devices at the event, which means we'll most likely be seeing the Galaxy Flip 5 and the Galaxy Fold 5.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;This year, Seoul was selected because of its role in influencing global trends with its dynamic culture and innovation, while it also reflects Samsung’s strong confidence in the foldable category,&quot; the company wrote in its announcement.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Galaxy Flip 5 might have a larger external display, based on the <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5">latest rumors</a>, as well as a new hinge design that makes the crease on its display less noticeable. It'll also reportedly be powered by a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip, just like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review-specs-price-photo-and-video-take-center-stage-140034341.html">Galaxy S23</a>. As for the Galaxy Fold 5, it's also rumored to have a new hinge design that gets rid of its predecessor's gap, ensures both sides lie flat on top of each other when folded and makes the display crease less visible. The device could be powered by a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, as well.&nbsp;</p><p>We have less than a couple of months to find out if those rumors are true — we'll update you when Samsung announces a specific date for the event.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/samsung-will-focus-on-foldables-in-its-upcoming-july-unpacked-event-064922443.html?src=rss
