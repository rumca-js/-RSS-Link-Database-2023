<p>This skilful three-part documentary about Africa’s cultural renaissance looks at Nigeria, Morocco and South Africa. Expect everything from TikTok dances to the legacy of Fela Kuti</p><p>Despite what the title of this show implies, Africa is not a country. It is not a monolith. It is not a single entity moving in unison. Its struggles and triumphs are complex and varied. Fortunately, this three-part documentary series never treats it as one place or people on a single journey. The journalist and broadcaster <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/afuahirsch">Afua Hirsch</a> takes on three very different countries – Morocco, Nigeria and South Africa – to paint an intricate portrait of a pan-African “cultural renaissance” that she believes is happening in “one of the fastest growing parts of the world and with the youngest population”.</p><p>She looks to the forefront of arts and culture in the countries, meeting established icons, but focusing on the younger generation’s creativity and ingenuity in reimagining the status quo. Each country contains a multitude of cultures, influences, languages and ambitions, but Hirsch braids the strands together skilfully.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/13/africa-rising-with-afua-hirsch-review-51-more-episodes-of-this-fascinating-series-please">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Fleeing Nazi Germany and ending up in Venezuela, the unusual artist found a career crafting offbeat sculptures, on display in a new exhibition</p><p>The modernist artist Gertrud Goldschmidt, better known simply as Gego, was born to unassuming, if prosperous circumstances in Hamburg, Germany, in 1912. As a Jew, she fled Nazi Germany alongside her family in 1939, arriving alone in Caracas, Venezuela, which at the time was a booming capital churning with a vibrant artistic renaissance. Seizing the opportunity presented by her departure from Europe, Gego would reinvent herself in Venezuela with the freedom and fervor of an emigrant, going on to produce a body of work that many have classified among the most original artistic outputs of the 20th century.</p><p>“I believe she is part of the incredible artists of the postwar era that have touched upon not just one medium, but many mediums,” said the art dealer Dominique Lévy, a founding member of the art agency LGDR, which has just opened a tightly curated show of Gego’s work, Lines in Space. Lévy continued, “She had the courage to stay the course without worrying about trends, without any fear. She should be up there with the greatest.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/13/gego-artist-gertrud-goldschmidt-lines-in-space">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The outrage caused by the jailing of a mother for ending her pregnancy after the legal limit should spark a wider rethink of archaic legislation</p><p>The case of a mother prosecuted for inducing her own abortion after the legal limit is tragic. Her imprisonment is unconscionable. The judge accepted that she was in “emotional turmoil” when she ended her pregnancy at between 32 and 34 weeks: with lockdown imposed, she had moved back in with her estranged partner while carrying another man’s child and was seeking to hide the pregnancy. She has since experienced guilt and depression, and is plagued by nightmares and “flashbacks to seeing [her] dead child’s face”. Her three children, one of whom has special needs and is thus especially reliant upon her, will be denied her for the next 14 months.</p><p>Many have asked good questions about the decisions of prosecutors to pursue the case in these circumstances, and of the judge to impose a prison sentence.

<p>The former Italian prime minister allowed dark forces into his governments. The consequences are yet to play themselves out</p><p>Millions of Italians will focus their attention on Wednesday on Milan’s great cathedral, as Silvio Berlusconi is given a <a href="https://www.ansa.it/english/news/2023/06/12/berlusconi-day-of-national-mourning-for-state-funeral-weds_830f1e90-8f8e-4146-9fbe-b62c53ac18a3.html" title="">state funeral</a> in the city he made his power base for over 30 years.

My 62-year-old husband, who has early-onset dementia, was diagnosed when he was 58. He hasn’t worked since he was 56, and I was forced to retire a year ago. Thinking about how we will pay for his future care keeps me awake at night. My husband had stage 4 cancer at 49, but I recall that I was relieved not to have to worry about money, as we were protected by sick pay.</p><p>Because my husband has dementia, the care he needs is deemed to be social, not medical, and so I am looking at crippling care fees, with him in a home or with a patchwork of carers at our home. I have no idea how we will fund this; it will drain our savings. I want my husband to have the dignity and care he deserves, but how long will I be able to provide it without having to sell our home?

One of the strongest elements of her political career is that she took up the tools and instruments that women and men fought for, even died for, over many years: the right to vote but also the right to be elected, and from this, the right to shape the laws and conduct of a country, and to bring about true equality and democracy through strong legislation.</p><p>I understand why people choose to demonstrate, to form pressure groups, to campaign through social media. Yet, election to office is surely the wise way to change the world, with the tools bequeathed to us by the brave of the past.

Today’s task is to nail it in a single take, and to do it – as the title of the freestyle series he’s shooting for makes clear – with No Miming. “It’s more challenging,” he goes on, “but I’ve been preparing for this all week.” There’s a break in the rain, hush falls, and Keyz goes again – careering down the stairs, mob-handed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/13/touch-mic-shell-it-british-freestyle-rap-videos-global-phenomenon">Continue reading...</a>

## Sad, confused, deluded: spare a thought for the friends of Boris Johnson at this difficult time | Marina Hyde

<p>Things may look dark but his acolytes are determined to go down fighting. And, true to type, he is determined to let them</p><p>Can I just check something before we begin, because it feels as though we’re dealing with a weight of irony that defies all known physics? Is Boris Johnson leaving British politics absolutely howling with anger because someone supposedly told <em>him</em> a lie? Is Boris Johnson wetting his pants thrice daily over the injustice of <em>him</em> being supposedly misled? Is Boris Johnson now appalled at <em>someone else’s</em> supposedly casual relationship with the truth? It seems, incredibly, that he is. In which case I honestly don’t think I could take this story more seriously. It’s too perfect. Boris Johnson has been Boris Johnsonned.</p><p>To the event horizon of irony, then, and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/12/rishi-sunak-goes-on-offensive-in-row-over-boris-johnson-honours-list">ongoing row</a> over whether Rishi Sunak did or didn’t tell Johnson he could bend the rules to get peerages for a set of political inadequates completely devoid of ministerial achievements, and notable only for their slavish loyalty to a guy who would have betrayed them in a heartbeat if he thought there was some minuscule, fleeting advantage for himself at that moment. I note there is also some hokey cokey about why Johnson, 58, couldn’t get a knighthood for his daddy (genuinely one of the worst people in the country). But let’s face it: that one can’t even be dignified with discussion.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/13/boris-johnson-nadine-dorries-tory-infighting">Continue reading...</a>

## Mbappé delivers challenge to PSG hierarchy with Real Madrid ‘lies’ claim

<ul><li>Striker says he is ‘very happy’ and will stay next season</li><li>But PSG may lose player on free transfer in summer 2024</li></ul><p>Kylian Mbappé will leave Paris Saint-Germain next summer but not before – if Kylian Mbappé is to be believed. Within an hour of his camp releasing a statement announcing he had no intention of continuing at the club beyond the end of his contract, which expires in 2024, the France striker responded to reports that he wants to join Real Madrid immediately by dismissing them as “LIES” and insisting: “I have already said that I will continue at PSG next season where I am very happy.”</p><p>Mbappé’s statement comes as a direct challenge to the PSG hierarchy, who are determined not to lose the him for free in a year’s time, as a standoff develops, the first step in a long summer. Madrid had initially planned to move for Mbappé in 2024 but would be prepared to bid now if he is put on the market, particularly after the departure of Karim Benzema 12 months ahead of schedule. The Spanish club, though, remain reluctant to be drawn into another battle having failed with a €200m (£171m) bid to sign him in 2021 and again in 2022 as his contract was coming to an end, when they believed he would join them on a free transfer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/13/kylian-mbappe-dismisses-reports-of-joining-real-madrid-immediately-from-psg-as-lies">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As well as defiant stories of empowered kids, we need to offer reminders that the responsibility isn’t theirs alone</p><p>When I was in primary school my favourite Baby-Sitters Club member was Dawn Schafer, the environmental crusader. This was the 1990s, when we were all very concerned about CFCs and other greenhouse gases, although not enough to lose sleep over them. I remember carefully spelling out CHLOROFLUOROCARBONS in bubble letters on poster paper for a school project. I had a thing for dolphins and wanted to be a marine biologist. Clean Up Australia Day was still in its infancy. <br /><br />Our world was smaller then, information thinner on the ground. Dial-up internet was years away from being a fixture in most homes and we collected cardboard circles from chip packets for fun. It’s easy to wearily suggest kids today have it better. But we didn’t feel that we had to carry the weight of the world on our shoulders. We watched Captain Planet, recycled, sometimes picked up extra rubbish if we were being punished or feeling virtuous, but we mostly trusted adults had things in hand. There was never any suggestion it might be too late to turn the ship around.</p><p>That’s a luxury today’s kids don’t have. They navigate an increasingly complex world, with more awareness than ever before about what is going wrong – and it’s taking a toll. A <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(21)00278-3/fulltext">survey of 10,000 young people</a> in 2021 found 84% were at least moderately worried about climate change, 59% were extremely worried and 45% said it negatively affected their daily life and functioning. The low hum of climate anxiety is building to a roar and it’s having a profound effect on kids’ mental health.<br /><br />In the summer of 2019-2020, as bushfires raged across Australia, driving species to the brink of extinction and turning air hazardous, it seemed something had finally shifted. This was our wake-up call. The world was taking notice and I was sure things would be different after this. We would recover and mobilise in a unified way. Then came Covid. The air was safe to breathe again, but only if no one else was standing nearby. Disposable masks littered the streets and KeepCups were banned. Along with the rest of the world, I fell into a deep funk. I watched a lot of TV.<br /><br />One night the screen transported me to a magical place, an icy island halfway between Norway and the north pole, home to reindeer, polar bears and northern lights. On the island was a mountain, its entrance marked by a glittering green art installation. And inside the mountain was a vault filled with millions of seeds. But this wasn’t a fantasy film, it was a real place: the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/03/global-seed-vault-svalbard-virtual-tour-aoe">Global Seed Vault in Svalbard</a> – built by the Norwegian government for the good of humanity. More than one million seed samples from almost every country in the world are stored there in case of global disaster, such as war – or climate catastrophe.<br /><br />This microdose of wonder during a dark time inspired what would become my first picture book. <a href="https://www.uqp.com.au/books/the-garden-at-the-end-of-the-world">The Garden at the End of the World</a> is about a girl who finds a rare plant near her home and goes on an adventure with her botanist mother to deliver it to the Global Seed Vault for safekeeping. It was the lullaby I needed to get me through lockdown – an ode to nature and wonder and the helpers; the good things already being done. I didn’t realise it would resonate with so many weary kids and parents as well.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/14/its-not-the-job-of-children-to-fix-the-climate-crisis-we-must-show-them-grown-ups-are-leading-the-way">Continue reading...</a>

The former first lady is well known for her <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/31/missing-melania-trump-breaks-silence-absence-tweet">disappearing acts</a>: she routinely vanishes from the public eye for extended periods, sparking speculation about whether she has finally left her husband and stoking conspiracy theories about her whereabouts. Now, however, Melania is making headlines because she <em>hasn’t </em>vanished. After being accused of illegally hoarding top secret documents in (among other places) a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/09/five-revelations-trump-unsealed-indictment">Mar-a-Lago loo</a>, which he denies, Trump is in the most trouble he has ever been in, and Melania is reportedly “supporting him 100%”.</p><p>According to a recent <a href="https://pagesix.com/2023/06/09/melania-trump-to-stick-by-donald-as-ivanka-stays-away/">New York Post</a> report, an anonymous source close to the Trumps is keen to reassure everyone that Melania will “stand by her man” in his hour of need. Another unnamed source insinuated that, while getting hit with a 37-count federal indictment for mishandling top-secret classified documents – which Trump also denies – might constitute a crisis in some households, it was just another day in Trump world. “They are used to dealing with this stuff,” the insider said. Yet another unnamed source said: “Melania knows what she signed up for. She is in a wait-and-see position. [Donald will] either be in prison or be president. Or both.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/13/ivanka-trump-is-long-gone-but-melania-is-waiting-will-her-husband-be-president-or-go-to-prison">Continue reading...</a>

## The hedonist’s hedonist: why Jack Grealish is having the best week of his life

<p>It’s four days since Manchester City’s £100m midfielder helped his team win the treble. He’s still partying hard</p><p>Jack Grealish is having the best week of his life. Of course he is – he’s just won the treble with Manchester City (the Champions League, the Premier League and the FA Cup), and only one other English football team has ever done that. But this isn’t just anybody having the best week of their life – it’s Jacko. To put it in context, <em>every</em> week is a good week for Grealish. He is the optimist’s optimist, the hedonist’s hedonist, the party animal’s party animal. And this is his time. In years to come, this behaviour will become known as doing a Jack. There may well be a four-day festival named after him – Grealishbury? Jackstock? – where revellers have pricey vodka poured down their throat as they “do the turkey”.</p><p>Even when he was playing terribly last year during his first season at City, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/aug/05/jack-grealish-seals-record-100m-manchester-city-move-from-aston-villa">despite having being signed for £100m</a>, Jacko was having a great time – whether photobombing other players’ interviews, telling the press <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk7SMT38nx8">he’d been playing terribly</a>, <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/grealish-foden-man-city-guardiola-22526936">being caught out on the lash</a> by his manager, Pep Guardiola.

<p>Salt affects flavour more than any other ingredient, but there are ways to keep your intake low and your food tasting good, says our panel of culinary experts</p><ul><li>Got a culinary dilemma? Email <a href="mailto:feast@theguardian.com">feast@theguardian.com</a></li></ul><p><strong>My wife tells me off for adding salt to my pasta water, and seasoning my food during cooking</strong><strong> – a pinch of salt as I cook my mushrooms just elevates them</strong><strong>. How do I keep to sensible salt levels</strong><strong> and should I add it to my mushrooms on toast</strong><strong>?<br /></strong><em><strong>Nick</strong></em><strong> </strong><strong><br /></strong>Something tells me I’m going to get into all sorts of bother for wading into a marital debate, but here goes nothing: <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/food-types/salt-nutrition/">according to the NHS</a>, adults should consume no more than 6g salt a day (that’s about a teaspoon), but <a href="https://www.actiononsalt.org.uk/">Action on Salt</a> says we are eating about 8.1g a day on average. So, Nick’s wife is right that we have a problem with salt.</p><p>To answer his question, though, you need to take a step back and look at what you’re eating as a whole. “Overall, ultra-processed and shop-bought, precooked foods have a relatively large amount of salt in them,” says Dr Saliha Mahmood Ahmed, author of <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-kitchen-prescription-9781399706292">The Kitchen Prescription</a> and former MasterChef winner. By which she means ready meals, pasta sauces, crisps and the like. If much of your diet is made up of such foods, then, Ahmed says, you are probably getting too much salt. However, if Nick mostly cooks from scratch and avoids highly salted foods in the first place, then his mushrooms are in luck: “It’s probably OK,” Ahmed says. That said, be wary of hidden salt in, say, the toast: <a href="https://www.actiononsalt.org.uk/salt-surveys/2023/bread/#d.en.1028868">research by Action on Salt</a> found that three out of four packaged sliced bread sold in supermarkets contain as much (or more) salt per slice than a bag of ready salted crisps.</p><p>Got a culinary dilemma?

So tell us what you really, really, really wanna know</p><p>With a group that completely reset popular culture followed by a thriving solo career, Melanie C is both a national treasure and a global phenomenon. Now 49, the singer once known as Sporty Spice will perform a full solo set at this year’s Glastonbury for the first time. To mark the occasion, we are inviting readers to submit questions for the sometime Spice Girl in the comments below, to be answered live from Worthy Farm later this month.</p><p>What went on to be one of the biggest pop groups in history started when Melanie C was studying at performing arts college. She responded to a magazine ad for a new girl group and, by the time she was 18 had joined the Spice Girls with Melanie Brown, Victoria Beckham, Geri Halliwell and Emma Bunton. The group’s worldwide success was immediate thanks to their anthemic pop hits laced with an affable girl-power mantra. Their breakthrough single Wannabe topped the charts in 37 countries, becoming the biggest-selling debut single of all time, and their debut album Spice was certified multi-platinum in 27 countries. Their 1997 follow-up Spiceworld received similar acclaim, selling over 14m copies worldwide.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/13/post-your-questions-for-mel-c">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The former prime minister was a symptom, not the cause, of a political culture that gorges on spectacle and trivia</p><p>Politicians, journalists and assorted hangers-on have been regaling each other with their risqué Boris Johnson anecdotes for as long as I can remember. “Boris” this, “BoJo” that. Even his detractors used his first name. The braggadocio, the enjoyment of watching his ascent, reached a peak during his tenure as mayor of London. Commentators, even those on the left, joked about how fun it was to have a Conservative in charge of the capital city who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/16/stuck-zip-wire-boris-johnson-london-2012-olympics">whizzed around on a zipwire</a>.</p><p>The bonhomie suddenly turned to buyers’ remorse when he embraced the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/21/boris-johnson-joins-campaign-to-leave-eu">Brexit cause</a> in 2016. What, I ask now, as I asked then, took people so long? It was abundantly clear to me from the moment I met him (he and I were foreign correspondents at the same time for the Telegraph) that Johnson was a charlatan.

Marinated fruit that’s perfect for pudding – or breakfast<p>There are endless ways to deal with the strawberry season that don’t involve smothering them in cream and sugar. I find the most useful are those I can enjoy for dessert or breakfast; simple ways that flatter the berries.</p><p>Remove the leaves from 400g of <strong>strawberries</strong>, then cut all but the smallest ones in half. Cut 4 <strong>passion fruit</strong> in half and remove their seeds, juice and flesh into a bowl with a teaspoon. Squeeze the juice from 1 large <strong>orange</strong> and add to the passion fruit. Stir in 1 tsp of <strong>balsamic vinegar</strong> and the merest pinch of <strong>caster sugar</strong>. Taste and tweak as necessary. Add the strawberries to the sauce and set aside in the fridge to marinate for about 30 minutes. Serve the marinated berries with ice-cream, fromage frais or by themselves. <em>Enough for 4</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/13/nigel-slater-recipe-for-strawberries-with-passion-fruit">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sincere performances and lively banter turn hokey into entertaining as Josh Lucas’s engineer and his family do battle with a megalodon</p><p>It would seem that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/03/researchers-reveal-true-scale-of-megalodon-shark-for-first-time">megalodons are the menace of the moment</a>. These ginormous sharks, thought to be extinct for millions of years, have been retro-spawned for entertainment purposes by the audiovisual-industrial complex – specifically in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/16/the-meg-shark-action-film-message-ecological-destruction">the Meg franchise</a> but also on the Discovery Channel – because great white sharks, veterans of the Jaws movies, just don’t cut it any more. Still, in thematic terms there’s a throughline that connects most shark movies: one way or another, they’re all about the return of the repressed, with the sharks manifesting the oceanic subconsciousness’ raging, violent id that has been enraged by the human superego effort at mastery over nature. In the original Jaws, it’s not so much Bruce the shark that’s the big bad as it is the township’s greedy mayor, determined to declare the beach safe in the interests of capitalism.</p><p>Directed by American Adrian Grunberg, its screenplay written by Boise Esquerra working from a screenplay by Carlos Cisco, The Black Demon effectively sticks to this well-greased formula. Yes, there’s a ginormous shark pootling around the waters along the coast of Mexico, locally known as “el demonio negro”. But the real, nefarious behemoth of the deep is a leaky oil-drilling platform offshore that was installed by a fictional conglomerate known as Nixon Oil, the name itself redolent of right-wing gringo corruption. (Which is ironic because Richard Nixon, for all his sins, was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/23/epa-william-ruckelshaus-republicans-climate-change">the president who started the Environmental Protection Agency</a>.) Paul (Josh Lucas) is an engineer who works for Nixon, and as the film starts he arrives in the town nearest to the rig he supervised building years ago, with his wife, Ines, (Fernanda Urrejola) and two kids, Audrey (Venus Ariel) and Tommy (Carlos Solórzano) in tow for a family vacation while he inspects the rig.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/13/the-black-demon-review-daft-but-fun-giant-shark-mayhem-on-mexican-oil-rig">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Feminist groups sound alarm over little-noticed plan to expand power of state-run religious courts</p><p>For months, the massive protests that have taken place in Israel have rallied groups across the country on issues surrounding the supreme court and judicial independence. Amid the uproar and media attention, however, Israeli feminist groups say a crucial element of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/27/gun-toting-prayer-reciting-protesters-throng-jerusalem-to-back-judicial-overhaul">far right’s judicial overhaul package</a> has been lost in the noise, and as a result women’s legal rights are more at stake than they have been in years.</p><p>“I think most of the public who are out protesting don’t even know about this issue, but it’s hugely problematic for women,” said the Israeli lawyer Tamar Ben Dror of the group Women Lawyers for Social Justice, referring to a subset of changes within the Israeli government’s judicial overhaul package that would massively expand the power of state-run religious courts.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/13/patriarchal-biased-israeli-women-fear-loss-rights-rabbinic-courts-legal-overhaul">Continue reading...</a>

And it’s not just Polly’s family that’s in trouble.

Each choice represents an Aspiration’s approach to a problem – Power favours assertiveness, Bliss wants to avoid conflict, and so on – and making a decision locks you out of the alternatives. If you’re not sure what to pick, you can look ahead on the tree and see what your choice may lead to.</p><p>Harmony: The Fall of Reverie is out now on PC and Nintendo Switch, and 22 June on Xbox and PlayStation; £22.99</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jun/13/harmony-the-fall-of-reverie-review-dont-nod">Continue reading...</a>

There were cameras flashing everywhere. I could hear the British people in the crowd cheering me on, saying: ‘Come on, Tessa!’”</p><p>The moment she realised she had won was surreal. “I couldn’t believe it; I was in seventh heaven.

<p>As the long-awaited UK inquiry kicks off, it’s the people in power who should be under the spotlight, not the experts who did their best to advise them</p><p>As the Covid inquiry kicks off oral hearings today, we will once again debate what exactly happened in 2020 and 2021, and who is ultimately responsible for the decisions made. The government has already started to close in on scientists and point the finger at them for the poor response in the early stages of the pandemic. The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has said it was a<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/24/sunak-says-it-was-a-mistake-to-empower-scientists-during-covid-pandemic"> mistake to “empower scientists”</a> and the BMJ pointed to the former health secretary Matt Hancock <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/373/bmj.n1504">making “science the fall guy”</a> in the blame game over what went wrong.</p><p>But it’s vital that the inquiry separates out what were scientific questions, that independent advisers and academics could provide data and input on, and what were leadership decisions. Policy measures such as closing gyms or schools or play parks, or the introduction of mandatory face coverings, were conveyed as “scientific” decisions, but they weren’t. Scientists could present the probable risks and benefits of certain policy options, but the final decision didn’t lie with them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/13/covid-inquiry-ministers-scientific-advisers">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Inert characters mar the Real Life author’s new novel – a study of education, economics and desire set on a campus in America’s midwest</p><p>Brandon Taylor’s absorbing debut, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/17/real-life-by-brandon-taylor-review-a-brilliant-debut">Real Lif</a></em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/17/real-life-by-brandon-taylor-review-a-brilliant-debut">e</a>, shortlisted for the Booker in 2020, followed a gay black biochemistry postgrad who finds his path absurdly trip-wired by the assumptions of white colleagues. As satire, it was phenomenally effective, with the choicest skewering saved for those who see the main character primarily as a means to trumpet their own empathy. Crucially, the book never made a saint of its protagonist, who, more than ready to feel the weight of the world on his shoulders, has one or two blind spots of his own.<br /><br />Taylor’s next book, <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/filthy-animals-9781911547983">Filthy Animals</a></em>, was a series of linked short stories<br />again exploring class, sex and race in a campus setting but this time<br />inhabiting three characters rather than one. His new book, dubbed “a<br />symphony of a novel” (blurb-speak for “barely disguised story collection”), sticks with higher-ed sexual entanglements in the American midwest but further stretches his canvas to more than double the number of characters, with uncertain results.<br /><br />It opens in a poetry workshop as seen through the eyes of one of its students, Seamus, whose peers are, he thinks, merely “tethering their bad ideas to recognised names and hoping someone would call them smart, call them sharp, call them radical and right, call them a poet and a thinker and a mind, even if they were just children”. He can’t hide his disparagement, not least of someone “whose work was chiefly about herself, as if all that had transpired in the existence of humankind was no more consequential than the slightly nervy account of her first use of a tampon”. His sceptical comments rile female classmates who are quick to accuse him of “violence”.<br /></p><p>There’s more than a whiff in this piss-take of MFA culture of a former creative writing graduate unloading a degree’s worth of beef (you suspect that a small portion of the book’s audience may be reading the workshop scenes very attentively indeed). But the literary send-up is just a springboard for a broader exploration of education, economics and desire. When class is brought prematurely to an end and Seamus picks up an extra shift at the hospice kitchen where he funds his study, Taylor introduces the book’s central tension, between students who have money and those who don’t, as micro-dramas continually break out among its highly strung cast over, say, the morality of selling sex clips online or working in an abattoir as they pursue ambitions in music, dance and writing.<br /><br /><em>Real Life</em> drew power from putting us in the headspace of a single character at odds with his milieu. Nothing in <em>The Late Americans</em> matches the dramatic interest of that book; the basic but unignorable problem is that the characters are simply too inert. Dialogue boils down to passive-aggressive squabbles that circle unvoiced emotion, a tension-generating strategy dulled through overuse. It hardly helps that the novel itself keeps insisting how irrelevant everything is. What starts as the despondency of particular characters (“He mattered so little”; “They were all inconsequential”) spirals into a kind of blanket auto-cancellation: “the whole world, the whole procession of its events marched on without a single notice or care that there in their tiny, obscure particle of the galaxy, two people’s hearts were breaking over and over again”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/13/the-late-americans-by-brandon-taylor-review-a-real-university-challenge">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I live with my parents while saving for my first property but wonder whether their mortgage lender would not like the plan</p><p><strong>Q</strong> I’m in my early 30s and live with my parents while saving for my first house, which I will be looking to buy in the next year or two.</p><p>My parents live in a large semi-detached house that they extended to twice the size of the original three-bed in the early 90s. They are both in their 60s now and thinking about retiring but are held back as they still have a mortgage to pay and aren’t keen to move out of the area they’ve lived in for more than 30 years. They’ve recently proposed the idea of splitting the house into two separate addresses, keeping the extended part of the house for themselves and selling me the original part of the house. Both parts of the house would be a good size and have parking and garden access, so I think we meet all the criteria for size and space that the local council would have. The sale would provide enough to pay off their remaining mortgage, making it possible for them to retire. It would also make it easier for me to get on the property ladder as they would give me a small discount on the price (property prices are high in this area).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jun/13/my-parents-want-to-split-their-home-into-two-houses-selling-one-to-me-is-it-feasible">Continue reading...</a>

Take the niceness of Bake Off and multiply it by a thousand, and you are still nowhere close to how much the contestants are rooting for one another, even though they would all clearly appreciate the $250,000 prize for themselves.</p><p>I ask Norton if he ever wishes that there was a bit more grit in the oyster? “Every now and again, there’s a little bit of grit in the oyster and it makes for great telly,” he says, adding: “It makes me so uncomfortable.” But then, to be real for a second: “I think the grit in the oyster is often the world around the drag performers. There’s so much grit out there; let’s just be nice shiny oysters in here. We had one contestant from India … well, a lot of them are trying to perform in countries where there really isn’t a safe space for them to do it.

But in a way the true creative force behind the piece, called Green Screen, isn’t her at all. It’s not even human. On the back of a giant LED screen, Steyerl has grown a vertical garden with ferns and hops. The plants generate bioelectrical signals, which are translated into sounds that have been paired with a rudimentary drum track. The results, which come warbling out of a pair of speakers, are fed into an AI engine that turns them into heavily pixelated animations of budding flowers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/13/post-internet-artist-hito-steyerl-refusing-honours-big-tech">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Kenyan novelist’s life and work has intersected with many of the biggest events of the past century. At 85, he reflects on his long, uncompromising life in writing</p><p>In October, I flew to Irvine to meet the novelist Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o. I had spent the previous few weeks in cold and windy Iowa, and the sunshine and warmth of California was a balm. I sat in the back seat of my cab, quiet. Outside, huge American trucks thundered past, the tangy smell of the ocean in the air.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/13/ngugi-wa-thiongo-kenyan-novelist-profile-giant-of-africa-literature">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The purchase of professional golf by a brutal regime has exposed yet again the lack of moral sanctities on the global free market</p><p>Brace for another season of upheaval in the sports world. The Arabs are coming. Again. After the Qatar World Cup raised misgivings about sportswashing, that charge is now being levelled at Saudi Arabia. The Saudi sovereign wealth fund PIF has essentially bought professional golf, taking over the PGA Tour by merging it with LIV, a new, smaller competition golf series that Saudi Arabia launched in 2021. Last year’s World Cup taught the Saudis a very important lesson. Oil is temporary; sport is for ever.</p><p>The move has triggered outrage. Human Rights Watch declared that Saudi Arabia “is attempting to ‘sportswash’ its egregious record of human rights violations”. US media channels have numerous segments <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/what-is-sportswashing-understanding-the-criticism-of-the-pga-tour-liv-golf-merger/">discussing</a> the ethics of accepting money from a notoriously brutal regime. These are justified concerns: Saudi Arabia’s image problem has intensified under its leader, Mohammed bin Salman, who brought the nation into global disrepute with the grisly murder of the Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a crackdown on political opposition and the ramping up of capital punishment. Last year, Saudi Arabia <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/12/saudi-arabia-executes-men-in-one-day">executed 81 people in 24 hours</a> for crimes that included witchcraft and drug smuggling.</p><p>Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/13/saudi-arabia-golf-human-rights-sportswashing">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The former PM and ex-Scottish first minister were controversial leaders. Now they are both facing disgrace – adding to the turmoil in British politics</p><p>They are two of the biggest characters in modern British politics but could not be more different. The showman-like Boris Johnson and the down-to-earth Nicole Sturgeon were tasked with the enormous responsibility of steering the nation through the Covid-19 pandemic, and often clashed. Yet both former leaders are not just out of power but facing disgrace.</p><p>On Friday, Boris Johnson suddenly quit as an MP – before the publication of a report into whether he misled parliament over the Partygate scandal, which would have led to a suspension that would have prompted a byelection. The Guardian’s political editor, <strong>Pippa Crerar</strong>, explains how in his furious resignation letter Johnson criticised the inquiry by the privileges committee, calling it a “kangaroo court” but also hit out at Rishi Sunak’s government. On Sunday came the news that Nicola Sturgeon had been arrested as part of a police investigation into allegations of financial misconduct by the Scottish National party. The former first minister of Scotland has proclaimed her innocence and said the experience was “deeply distressing”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/jun/13/the-long-shadows-of-boris-johnson-and-nicola-sturgeon-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
