<p>Trump set to appear at courthouse to answer federal charges in Mar-a-Lago document case </p><p>Good morning, US politics blog readers. <strong>Donald Trump</strong> is expected to at 3pm ET today appear at a Miami federal courthouse to answer charges brought by special prosecutor <strong>Jack Smith</strong> over the classified documents discovered last year at his Mar-a-Lago resort. It’s not the first time the former president has appeared as a defendant in court – Trump was arraigned in New York City two months ago after the Manhattan district attorney, <strong>Alvin Bragg</strong>, accused him of falsifying business records ahead of the 2016 election, a case that remains ongoing. But the charges brought by Smith are even more serious, with potentially long jail sentences and chilling national security implications. The former president is expected to mount a vigorous defense, and there’s a chance the case will not be resolved by the time of the 2024 election, where Trump looks like a good bet for the GOP’s nomination. Thus, today is likely to be the first episode of a long series of court dates for the former president. As for this blog, we’ll be following his appearance today live as it happens.</p><p>Here’s what else is going on today:</p><p><strong>Joe Biden</strong>’s schedule yesterday was upended by a surprise root canal, but the White House say he’s back in business and will meet with the Nato secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, at 1pm.</p><p><strong>Also reportedly functioning again </strong>is the House of Representatives.

<p>Latest updates: chair Heather Hallett to make opening statement as first witnesses will appear on Wednesday</p><p><strong>Keir Starmer</strong> is giving a speech to the London Tech Week conference this morning. According to extracts released in advance, he will argue that artificial intelligence will pose challenges that will require “Labour values” from government if it is going to ensure that everyone benefits. He will say:</p><p>Our country is facing a choice about who benefits from the huge disruption that tech will bring. Will it be those who already hold wealth and power, or will it be the starter firms trying to break in and disrupt the industry, the patients trying to book at appointment with their GP, the worker using technology to enhance and improve their role …</p><p>The question facing our country is who will benefit from this disruption? Will it leave some behind, as happened with de-industrialisation across vast swathes of our country? Or can it help build a society where everyone is included, and inequalities are narrowed not widened?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/jun/13/covid-inquiry-evidence-coronavirus-labour-conservatives-uk-politics-latest">Continue reading...</a>
