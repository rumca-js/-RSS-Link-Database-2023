It\u2019s not the first time the former president has appeared as a defendant in court \u2013 Trump was arraigned in New York City two months ago after the Manhattan district attorney, <strong>Alvin Bragg</strong>, accused him of falsifying business records ahead of the 2016 election, a case that remains ongoing. But the charges brought by Smith are even more serious, with potentially long jail sentences and chilling national security implications. The former president is expected to mount a vigorous defense, and there\u2019s a chance the case will not be resolved by the time of the 2024 election, where Trump looks like a good bet for the GOP\u2019s nomination. Thus, today is likely to be the first episode of a long series of court dates for the former president.
