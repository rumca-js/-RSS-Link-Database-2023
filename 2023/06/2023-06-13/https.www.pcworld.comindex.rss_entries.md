<p>Dogtown. Night is falling. Only the neon-colored OLED walls remind us that this was once a district of Pacifica, the Dubai Night City, a luxury oasis that ran out of money in the corporate war. </p>



<p>We stand on high scaffolding that was supposed to be a sports stadium. We look up &ndash; rockets scream towards a plane, it goes down, literally whizzing over our heads before crashing with a thunderous explosion. But this isn&rsquo;t just any plane, it&rsquo;s Space Force One, the government plane of President Myers of the New United States of America in <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.cyberpunk.net/us/en/phantom-liberty&amp;xcust=2-1-1951843-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>&lsquo;s hotly anticipated <em>Phantom Liberty </em>expansion</a>. </p>

<p>We&rsquo;re sitting in a cyberpunk bar sparkling with neon at CD Projekt RED&rsquo;s super stylish headquarters in beautiful Warsaw, playing on a GeForce RTX 4090, all graphics settings turned up to maximum and in the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1782490/cyberpunk-2077-overdrive-mode-benchmarks-nvidia-rtx-path-tracing.html">eye-meltingly beautiful overdrive mode</a> with full real-time pathtracing. It&rsquo;s the next-generation evolution ray tracing, in which every ray of light is physically correctly reflected, refracted or absorbed when it hits a surface. And this is the <em>Crysis</em> moment that PC gamers have been waiting for for decades. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Mega spannend: Phantom Liberty ist als Spionage-Thriller inszeniert, politische Intrigen im Stil von 24 meets House of Cards inklusive. Und es sieht einfach verdammt gut aus. Die Spiegelungen des Exosuits der Lady hier, die Sch&auml;rfe ihrer Gesichtstextur, die Nat&uuml;rlichkeit der Lippen.  Hammer. " class="wp-image-1950294" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/PhantomLiberty_02.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Mega exciting: Phantom Liberty is staged as a spy thriller, political intrigue in the style of 24 meets House of Cards included. And it just looks damn good. The reflections of the lady&rsquo;s exosuit here, the sharpness of her facial texture, the naturalness of her lips.  </p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">CD Projekt RED</p></div>



<p>&ldquo;Can It Run <em>Crysis</em>?&rdquo; may now be replaced by &ldquo;Can It Run <em>Cyberpunk</em> with Path Tracing?&rdquo; <em>Crysis</em> was a game several graphics generations ahead of its competition in 2008. </p>



<p>And <em>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty</em> is now at least one graphics generation ahead of everyone else. It&rsquo;s a completely new experience, taking games to a whole other, much more cinematic level. Where we are used to having almost a cone of light pointed at protagonists when we talk to them, here the soft glow of neon lights in a market can only outline their faces, so that we only really see them at close range. It&rsquo;s much more realistic, and gorgeous.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Auch hier: Wie scharf die Mantis Blades wirken, wie echt sich die Spiegelungen des Umgebungslichts auf dem Stahl anf&uuml;hlen. Das ist dieser Crysis-Moment, auf den wir echt lange gewartet haben.  " class="wp-image-1950299" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/PhantomLiberty_03.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Again: How sharp the Mantis Blades look, how real the reflections of ambient light feel on the steel. This is the Crysis moment we&rsquo;ve been waiting for for a long time.  </p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">CD Projekt RED</p></div>



<p>And it works fantastically in this whimsical high-tech world of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, where people have bionic eyes or we don&rsquo;t see their exoskeleton on their back until they stand up. What makes <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> so incredibly strong is that every shop assistant in a market has a story to tell that transports the fantasy of Night City. There are those who have lost their legs in the war. And others who get augmented for fun and because it&rsquo;s in vogue. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Einfach mal darauf achten, wie echt das Feuer hier wirkt &ndash; wie die Flammen in den Himmel schie&szlig;en und dort vom Scheinwerfer der Drohne durchbrochen werden. Das f&uuml;hlt sich an, wie einen Film zu spielen, was sehr beeindruckend ist. " class="wp-image-1950303" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/PhantomLiberty_04.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Just look at how real the fire looks here &ndash; how the flames shoot up into the sky and are broken through by the drone&rsquo;s spotlight. It feels like playing a film, which is very impressive. </p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">CD Projekt RED</p></div>



<p>Path tracing is a hugely exciting technology because it&rsquo;s often quite subtle. Throwing smoke grenades into a room flooded with red light feels very authentic &ndash; the smoke looks dense, <em>like smoke</em>, and not artificial, partly because the color values of this reddish smoke affect the reflections. Flames look like real flames, creating an interplay of soot, smoke clouds, and particles flickering in the air. This smoky color world also now casts its own shadows and spreads over the scenery. It feels a bit like walking through a Christopher Nolan film, or experiencing <em>John Wick 4</em> in a cyberpunk universe. </p>



<h2 class="toc" id="dogtown-is-a-fantastic-open-world">Dogtown is a fantastic open-world</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Dogtown hat diesen Vibe eines Las Vegas, das nicht fertig geworden ist: Die kunstvolle Pyramide mit LED-Architektur erinnert etwa an das Luxor, aber rund herum sind &uuml;berall runtergekommene Kasinos, unfertige Bars, M&uuml;ll und Schrott all &uuml;berall. " class="wp-image-1950315" height="585" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/PhantomLiberty_06.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Dogtown has that vibe of a Las Vegas that didn&rsquo;t get finished: the ornate pyramid with LED architecture is roughly reminiscent of the Luxor, but all around are run-down casinos, unfinished bars, trash and junk everywhere. </p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">CD Projekt RED</p></div>



<p>CD Projekt RED is incredibly good at defining a setting through its people and architecture. Dogtown<strong> </strong>is this wild mix of &ldquo;shoulda been Night City&rsquo;s Las Vegas&rdquo;, with posh hotel complexes and lavish architecture punctuated by curved OLED walls. And then elsewhere it seems so improvised and self-cobbled together again, like in <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em>. Those areas where corporations don&rsquo;t matter are ruled with a stern hand by a former military man named Colonel Hanson, and yet it&rsquo;s not one of those apocalyptic places like downtown LA in <em>Blade Runner 2049</em>. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Der Markt hier bietet Militech-Hardware, die der Konzern hier nach dem Krieg vergessen hat und in Night City seltene Cyberware. Aber jede Figur hat auch eine Geschichte zu erz&auml;hlen, die mal traurig ist, mal witzig, mal einfach nur skurril und zynisch wie diese Welt eben ist. " class="wp-image-1950319" height="637" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/PhantomLiberty_07.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The market here offers Militech hardware that the corporation left here after the war and rare cyberware in Night City. But each character also has a story to tell, sometimes sad, sometimes funny, sometimes just whimsical and cynical as this world is. </p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">CD Projekt RED</p></div>



<p>When the futuristic Space Force One crashes into a market, it kills numerous people, sends vehicles in the area careening, triggers explosions in an apartment building, and&mdash;because no one can count on fire brigade or trauma units here (which only fly in if you have the right insurance)&mdash;the people help themselves. </p>



<p>That&rsquo;s exactly the beauty of an open world: we can sit on one of the motorbikes here, such as the Brennan Apollo on the side of the road, race through the cordon of Colonel Hansen&rsquo;s troops and engage in the first wild firefight of <em>Phantom Liberty</em>.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Secret-Service-Roboter des NSU versuchen Space Force One mit der Pr&auml;sidentin an Bord zu sichern, das Raumschiff wird aber bereits von Kurt Hansens Special Forces umstellt. " class="wp-image-1950329" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/PhantomLiberty_08.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Secret Service robots from the NSU try to secure Space Force One with the President on board, but the spaceship is already surrounded by Kurt Hansen&rsquo;s Special Forces. </p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">CD Projekt RED</p></div>



<p>Or we can watch as the people of Dogtown pull others from the rubble, support drones with searchlights, and enjoy some of this exciting architecture. </p>



<p><em>Phantom Liberty</em>&lsquo;s Dogtown is big. This first section oozes that Las Vegas vibe, driven home by an LED pyramid that&rsquo;s directly reminiscent of the Luxor Hotel on the Strip. Above it are cranes that don&rsquo;t seem to have been used for ages and half the district is a construction site, including a huge amount of rubbish &ndash; Hansen doesn&rsquo;t seem to have a rubbish collection service. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Dogtown ist viel gr&ouml;&szlig;er als man vielleicht denken k&ouml;nnte: Es gibt dieses Hotel-Plaza, Wohnh&auml;user, Gesch&auml;ftsviertel, aber auch die milit&auml;rische Festung von Colonel Hansen, die eine regelrecht dystopische &Auml;ra verbreitet. " class="wp-image-1950339" height="581" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/PhantomLiberty_09.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Dogtown is much bigger than you might think: There&rsquo;s this hotel plaza, apartment buildings, business districts, but also Colonel Hansen&rsquo;s military fortress, which spreads a downright dystopian era. </p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">CD Projekt RED</p></div>



<p>The bar chain Haven, which also exists in Night City, probably also wanted to set up a location here &ndash; we cruise past an LED sign. The sign is still there, but the bar was never built, instead there is now a multiple rocket launcher. I guess they don&rsquo;t like guests here. Wait a minute, isn&rsquo;t that where the missiles on the US president came from? </p>



<h2 class="toc" id="completely-new-gameplay-and-ai">Completely new gameplay and AI</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Waffen-Fanatiker Hansen schickt uns Killer-Roboter von Militech auf den Hals. Gott sei Dank k&ouml;nnen wir jetzt auch aus Autos und von Motorr&auml;dern mit MP5s und anderen einh&auml;ndigen Waffen ballern. " class="wp-image-1950341" height="652" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/PhantomLiberty_10.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Weapons fanatic Hansen sends Militech killer robots after us. Thank goodness we can now shoot from cars and motorbikes with MP5s and other one-handed weapons. </p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">CD Projekt RED</p></div>



<p>All right, we&rsquo;ll be honest: we could have bypassed Hansen&rsquo;s special commandos entirely Solid Snake-style. <em>Phantom Liberty</em> always gives us multiple play options, but the path to the crashed Space Force One is absolutely swarming with his troops. </p>



<p>Of course, we can also take them out from a distance with the Nekomata sniper with thermal sight, but as soon as we get closer to them, the useful skills of the brand new Relic skill tree become apparent: as Fast Solo, we can activate a kind of bullet-time from the air and riddle the enemy in slow motion &ndash; either sneaky, with the Apparition in combination with a silencer.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Praktisch: Auf dem Graumarkt von Dogtown gibt&rsquo;s Bullet-Time-Cyberware &ndash; wenn Keanu Reeves schon unser Hologram-Buddy ist, wollen wir ja auch wie in Matrix ballern.  " class="wp-image-1950357" height="510" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/PhantomLiberty_11-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Practical: The grey market in Dogtown has bullet-time cyberware &ndash; if Keanu Reeves is our hologram buddy, we want to shoot like in the Matrix.  </p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">CD Projekt RED</p></div>



<p>Or the good old Warden strum rifle, which we charge up beforehand for maximum firepower (with a particularly opulent muzzle flash shadow thanks to path tracing). With new reflex builds, we now block bullets in mid-air with the Mantis Blades and, with a little skill, bounce them off so that they send their senders to the graveyard of Dogtown. </p>



<p>Or accelerate on a motorbike with our katana and slash Hansen&rsquo;s boys&rsquo; tyres in a car chase. </p>



<p>Or hack cars while driving via cyberware, initiate an emergency stop or make them spontaneously explode. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Mit Katanas wehren wir jetzt Kugeln ab und schlitzen als Motorradbiker Reifen auf, was die Waffe der Ninjas sehr viel vielseitiger macht. CD Projekt RED verfeinert enorm viele Features auf smarte Art. " class="wp-image-1950365" height="598" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/PhantomLiberty_12.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>With katanas we now deflect bullets and slash tyres as motorbike bikers, which makes the ninja weapon much more versatile. CD Projekt RED refines an enormous number of features in a smart way. </p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">CD Projekt RED</p></div>



<p>The now-much-more-aggressive (and smarter) police AI of Dogtown tries to surround our vehicle with T-bone maneuvers, ram us off the road, and set up their armored trucks and Humvees for roadblocks&hellip;which we immediately blow up with heat-seeking missiles mounted permanently in the car. Yippee-ki-yay pork chops. These new James Bond-style vehicles, armored and armed to the teeth, are one of the highlights of Phantom Liberty. Gatling guns on the bonnet? Guided missiles on the gullwing door? Dogtown has something for everyone. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Die Barghest f&uuml;hren abgefahrene Panzerfahrzeuge Marke Eigenbau ein, die mehr Waffen an Bord haben als der Aston Martin von James Bond. Darf es eine Gatling auf der Motorhaube sein? Oder Lenkraketen aus den Seitenfl&uuml;geln. " class="wp-image-1950368" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/PhantomLiberty_13.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The Barghest introduce wacky home-made armoured vehicles that have more weapons on board than James Bond&rsquo;s Aston Martin. Would you like a Gatling gun on the bonnet? Or guided missiles from the side wings. </p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">CD Projekt RED</p></div>



<p>Depending on the heat level, we can change our appearance via cyberware, the cops and Dogtown mercenaries then no longer recognize us directly. </p>



<p>Even better? These many AI optimizations for mercenaries, security, and the Night City Police Department are also coming to the main game, even if you don&rsquo;t buy the <em>Phantom Liberty </em>expansion. At maximum heat level, we even have to face five new Max Tech Special Forces bosses. </p>



<h2 class="toc" id="phantom-libertys-story-and-characters">Phantom Liberty&rsquo;s story and characters</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Die Figuren sind bisher durch die Bank exzellent geschrieben: Vor allem Pr&auml;sidentin Myers ist ziemlich Badass drauf, wirkt aber auch herrlich intrigant &ndash; schlie&szlig;lich war sie CEO von Militech, hat also sicherlich eine Tonne Leichen im Fundament ihrer Villa vergraben.  " class="wp-image-1950370" height="597" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/PhantomLiberty_14.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The characters are excellently written across the board so far: President Myers in particular is pretty badass, but also comes across as delightfully scheming &ndash; after all, she was CEO of Militech, so she certainly has a ton of bodies buried in the foundation of her mansion.  </p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">CD Projekt RED</p></div>



<p>First, the most important news first: <em>Phantom Liberty</em> still features a lot of Keanu Reeves. <strong>Johnny Silverhand</strong> is still the ex-rockstar, ex-military dynamo cyber ghost who is deeply jaded in his fury about the world, but puts his cynicism into the best one-liners we&rsquo;ve seen in videogames in recent years. &ldquo;The politician bitch will ram her fist a meter up your ass and never pull it out again,&rdquo; he opines at one point, but that&rsquo;s just Johnny as he lives and breathes.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Das hat uns richtig gefreut: Keanu Reeves hat ganz offensichtlich einen Mega-Spa&szlig; mit seinem sarkastischen One-Liner-K&ouml;nig Johnny Silverhand. In unserer Demo war der, der heimliche Star. " class="wp-image-1950371" height="599" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/PhantomLiberty_15.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Keanu Reeves is clearly having a mega-fun with his sarcastic one-liner king Johnny Silverhand. In our demo he was the secret star. </p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">CD Projekt RED</p></div>



<p>He&rsquo;s referring to <strong>President Myers</strong>, who also plays up great. The whole cast of <em>Phantom Liberty</em> just <em>screams</em> HBO quality and that&rsquo;s a rating not many games earn. The lady is pretty badass too, totally reminding us of Harrison Ford in <em>Air Force One</em> and his legendary one liner &ldquo;Get. Off. My. Plane.&rdquo; When her snow-white Secret Service robots (which look like Apple could&rsquo;ve created them) are ambushed, Miss President herself loads up the M221 Saratoga and riddles a few mercenaries. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Speaking of HBO quality, Hollywood superstar Idris Elba plays <strong>Solomon Reed</strong>, Myer&rsquo;s best agent and a man who was betrayed by the Agency and thus became a sleeper agent. He&rsquo;s a classic CIA guy, good at bringing down governments without you realizing the US is behind it. <em>Phantom Liberty</em> oozes spy thriller vibesl we have no idea who we can trust and who is just playing games with us. Think somewhere between <em>24</em> and <em>Clear &amp; Present Danger</em>. </p>



<p>In general, all the characters are very well written, with many shades of gray. There are no classic good guys and bad guys in <em>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty</em>, only go-getters who push through their goals.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="&bdquo;Konflikt ist Storytelling&ldquo;, wie der Chefautor sagt. Colonel Hansen ist ein enorm spannender Gegenspieler, weil er quasi die Rolle eines Escobar spielt &ndash; er sorgt f&uuml;r die Einwohner von Dogtown, die dadurch nicht merken, dass er sie eigentlich unterjocht. " class="wp-image-1950372" height="645" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/PhantomLiberty_16.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>&ldquo;Conflict is storytelling,&rdquo; as the head writer says. Colonel Hansen is an enormously exciting antagonist because he plays the role of an Escobar, so to speak &ndash; he takes care of the inhabitants of Dogtown, who thereby do not realise that he is actually subjugating them. </p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">CD Projekt RED</p></div>



<p><strong>Songbird </strong>wants to help V with her illness, gives us the job, then just disappears after Space Force One crash lands. She seems unconcerned about the President, but nevertheless keen to get final confirmation that Meyers is indeed dead &ndash; as if someone paid her to do it. Or is she just unable to show emotion because she&rsquo;s a holographic AI? </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="CD Projekt RED verspricht den gr&ouml;&szlig;ten DLC der Firmengeschichte und es wirkt auf jeden Fall so, als w&uuml;rden wir eine Menge neuer Charaktere kennenlernen, bei denen man immer nicht so richtig wei&szlig;: Freund, Nutznie&szlig;er, Zweck-Partner? " class="wp-image-1950374" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/PhantomLiberty_17.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>CD Projekt RED is promising the biggest DLC in the company&rsquo;s history and it certainly seems like we&rsquo;re going to be introduced to a lot of new characters with shifting motivations. </p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">CD Projekt RED</p></div>



<p>President Myers seems to have only limited faith in her country&rsquo;s political elite and seems discreetly cunning &ndash; a power politician who would certainly have no problem sacrificing her agents to remain president. In certain moments she also comes across as very human, almost friendly, but she was CEO of Militech and arms suppliers are rarely the Good Guys. </p>



<p>The president offers V, your player character, to become the NSU agent. Whether or not you refuse the offer is up to you but there&rsquo;s sure to be appropriate consequences either way. With gangs, an NSU agent is more likely to face a bullet, but with certain corporations, it&rsquo;s likely to open doors </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Idris Elba ist eine interessante Besatzung, weil er viele Rollen spielen kann: Der harte Haudegen, der einsame Wolf in Luther. Aber auch den Charme eines James Bond verspr&uuml;hen kann, was wir hier in dieser Szene sehen. Mit ihm kann CD Projekt viel variieren. " class="wp-image-1950376" height="653" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/PhantomLiberty_18.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Idris Elba is an interesting cast because he can play many roles: The tough swashbuckler, the lone wolf in Luther. But he can also exude the charm of a James Bond, which we see here in this scene. CD Projekt can vary a lot with him.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">CD Projekt RED</p></div>



<p><strong>Solomon Reed:</strong> Idris Elba is a character actor and his character oozes, well, <em>Idris Elba</em> in <em>Phantom Liberty</em>. In <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> he&rsquo;s a Jack Bauer type: a tough dog and old wolf who has seen a lot. His rather reserved manner tends to be a good choice, because Johnny Silverhand is and remains a blabbermouth. There is no harm in a cool, methodical tactician, who can also play the gentleman in the club. But he rarely plays the first violin as Keanu Reeves remains Cyberpunk&rsquo;s biggest star. And that&rsquo;s a good thing</p>

<p>Have you tried out <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/545909/android-apps-windows-11-amazon-appstore.html">Windows 11&rsquo;s ability to run Android apps</a>? Pretty neat, right? But as you probably expected, the system has a few limitations in its early implementation. One of those is that you can&rsquo;t access files on your standard Windows drive or any attached storage via Android apps and vice versa. Microsoft is addressing this teething trouble in the latest Windows Subsystem for Android update, which among other things, adds basic file sharing and transfers. </p>



<p>The update should be headed out to Windows Insider builds starting today, according to the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/06/12/update-to-windows-subsystem-for-android-on-windows-11-june-2023/&amp;xcust=2-3-1951516-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Windows Insider blog</a> (spotted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/13/23759072/microsoft-windows-11-android-subsystem-file-sharing-feature&amp;xcust=2-3-1951516-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The Verge</a>). Other changes include security updates for both Android and the Linux kernel, bumping the Chromium webview version to 113, compatibility fixes for camera and Wi-Fi, and raw input for Android apps designed specifically for PCs. </p>



<p>Android apps on Windows still have a ways to go before they&rsquo;re ready for the average user, which is probably why it&rsquo;s still not enabled by default. You have to install an Amazon app via the Microsoft Store (current rating: 1.8 stars), and there&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/920437/how-to-sideload-unsupported-android-apps-in-windows-11.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">no smooth process for importing apps</a> from either a standard Android phone or Google&rsquo;s Play Store, the de facto standard for the platform. But with steady updates, it seems like Microsoft is interested in expanding the capability, if not fully embracing Google&rsquo;s ecosystem of Android apps, as seen on <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/552417/android-on-pc-windows-11-vs-chromebooks.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Android-compatible Chromebook laptops</a>. </p>

<p>When it comes to gaming mice, there are countless options out there. From various grip styles to ambidextrous and shooter mice, it&rsquo;s easy to get lost. If you&rsquo;re feeling overwhelmed by the plethora of choices, don&rsquo;t sweat it, as we&rsquo;ve got an awesome deal on tap for you today. Best Buy&rsquo;s currently selling the <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flogitech-pro-x-superlight-lightweight-wireless-optical-gaming-mouse-with-hero-25k-sensor-magenta%2F6493155.p%3FskuId%3D6493155&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed" rel="nofollow">Logitech Pro X Superlight Wireless for $129.99</a>, which is a savings of $30. The bright magenta color scheme really pops and the mouse itself weighs just 63 grams, which is incredibly lightweight. It&rsquo;s also super fast, so let&rsquo;s get right into it.</p>



<p>The Logitech Pro X has a maximum DPI of 25,600, a wireless range of 33 feet, and five programmable buttons. The maximum DPI of 25,600 is incredibly fast, so you may want to scale it back until you get accustomed to it. The idea is to build up to a higher DPI number over a period of time. This mouse is definitely designed with competitive FPS gaming in mind. When you&rsquo;re in an intensive match in which every second counts, you&rsquo;ll need a mouse that&rsquo;s ultra-fast.</p>



<p>This is a solid deal. You better jump on it now, though, as we don&rsquo;t expect it to last long.</p>

## Samsung’s stunning 49-inch OLED ultrawide monitor gets stunning price tag

<p>There are a lot of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/813301/best-gaming-monitors.html">OLED gaming monitors hitting the market</a> right now, and after years and years of watching the tech in the home theater space, we&rsquo;re happy to see them. But if your budget and your desk real estate are both unlimited, one announcement from CES has probably been weighing on your mind: the new Samsung Odyssey G95SC. That&rsquo;s the one that features an incredible OLED screen and as much tech as Samsung could cram into it, and since it&rsquo;s 49-freakin-inches wide, that&rsquo;s a lot of tech. Today we have both a release date and a price tag for the much-anticipated monitor.</p>



<p>The date is June 26th, and the price &mdash; you might want to sit down for this &mdash; <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/monitors/gaming/49-odyssey-oled-g95sc-dqhd-neo-quantum-processor-pro-0-03ms-240hz-curved-smart-gaming-monitor-ls49cg954snxza/&amp;xcust=2-3-1951301-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">is $2,199.99</a>. All things considered, it&rsquo;s not that outrageous, considering both the prices of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1505540/samsungs-ultrawide-oled-monitor-might-give-you-sticker-shock.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Samsung&rsquo;s massive Odyssey line</a> and the premium put on OLED gaming monitors at the moment. You&rsquo;d have a hard time finding a 27-inch OLED monitor for under a grand, and this one is basically two of them stuck together, with a bunch of the latest features to boot. </p>

<p>There&rsquo;s one silver lining to that price, though. If you pre-order through Samsung&rsquo;s online store, you&rsquo;ll get a $250 gift card to use for a future purchase. That&rsquo;s a definite plus if you&rsquo;re a big Samsung fan &mdash; maybe you&rsquo;re waiting on the company&rsquo;s next high-priced folding phone anyway, and you can treat this as a sizeable discount? Otherwise, deal-hunters might want to wait for a discount later this year as Samsung tries to clear out some inventory. Or, you know, just <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1440675/alienware-aw3423dwf-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">go for a cheaper and less bombastic OLED ultrawide</a>. </p>



<p>The OLED G9 would be the centerpiece of any /r/battlestation setup, thanks to its 5120&times;1440 resolution, 240hz refresh rate, and .03ms response time. Just remember that after you pay for this thing, you&rsquo;ll need a gaming PC actually <em>capable </em>of pushing out 7 megapixels of rendered game frame, more than two hundred times a second &mdash; maybe AMD Freesync can help with that. On top of the display specs, connections include the latest HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort, and a built-in USB-C hub. </p>

## Diablo IV’s horses are a steaming pile of disappointment

<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about mounts in video games, because <em>Diablo IV</em>&lsquo;s horses bum me out.</p>



<p>From horses to dragons to oversized beds that move around as if on wheels, mounts can be just about anything in MMORPGs like <em>World of Warcraft</em> and <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>. Not only are they something of a status symbol, as they&rsquo;re usually hard-earned during challenging boss battles and unforgiving grinds, but they&rsquo;re also necessary tools to get from place to place. Me? I like a fashionable mount that lessens my travel time and helps me get to far-away lands. That said, if the mount seriously stinks, it can really impact my gameplay. </p>



<p>Like many gamers as of late, I&rsquo;ve been playing the heck out of <em>Diablo IV</em>, Blizzard&rsquo;s action role-playing game. From the spooky music to the memorable characters (I&rsquo;m a massive Deckard Cain fan), the latest installment reminds me of <em>Diablo II</em>, which was one of my favorite games as a kid. While I love the boss fights and the Gothic environment, I have one particular gripe to get off my chest: The horse mount is massively frustrating and feels, at best, like an afterthought. It irritates me to no end. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Are you looking for more bold takes on video games? If so, check out this <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1359589/why-i-quit-overwatch-2-breakup-letter.html">PCWorld writer&rsquo;s love-hate relationship with Overwatch</a>.</em></p></blockquote>



<h2 id="chill-out-already">Chill out already! </h2>



<p>Mounts are meant to make traversing <em>Diablo IV</em>&lsquo;s world of Sanctuary easier, especially when traveling long distances. Sure, I use the waypoints (a teleport system that brings you directly to a city or camp site) whenever I can, but I still need a horse to get me to the doors of a dungeon. The horse mount is unwieldy and I hate it. When you first jump onto the mount, the animal launches you into a full-on run. Maybe this is useful when you&rsquo;re trying to escape a mob of monsters, but it&rsquo;s annoying when you&rsquo;re grouping up with friends in a safe zone and the horse is determined to launch you into another dimension. </p>



<p>This is a minor nitpick, sure, but why does the horse have to go so hard?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">My big beefy ass Druid riding a horse in DIABLO IV like <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://t.co/aIDnIRa7my&amp;xcust=2-3-1945763-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/aIDnIRa7my</a></p>&mdash; Demon King Kev (@KevShitpostKing) <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/KevShitpostKing/status/1664715638655406084?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=2-3-1945763-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">June 2, 2023</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<h2 id="bushes-are-the-biggest-obstacle">Bushes are the biggest obstacle</h2>



<p>My horse mount frequently gets stuck on bushes and trees. Is it funny? Yeah, it is. Is it aggravating? Absolutely. </p>



<p>Like I mentioned earlier, mounts are generally designed to make traveling easier. Well, that&rsquo;s not the case with my not-so-trusty steed in <em>Diablo IV</em>. Sometimes I end up ditching my horse mount and just legging it across Sanctuary to meet up with my friends. I find that I&rsquo;d rather run to my destination than to ride the horse and constantly get stuck on various objects. Using the mount on the roads isn&rsquo;t horrible, but when you venture into the lush jungle areas of the game, then you&rsquo;re in for a real barrel of laughs (sarcasm). </p>



<h2 id="it-gets-spooked-by-monsters">It gets spooked by monsters</h2>



<p>Look, I get that horses get spooked in real life, but can we suspend reality for a bit? The horse will get scared and throw you off when it&rsquo;s around too many monsters. There&rsquo;s a blue bar above your skills that indicates how scared your mount is. If the bar fills up, boom, you&rsquo;re kissing dirt. It&rsquo;s frustrating, especially when you&rsquo;re trying to run past mobs of monsters to get to your destination. There&rsquo;s nothing quite like your horse depositing you in the middle of a violent mob. Sometimes I just don&rsquo;t have the time or desire to deal with ravenous werewolves and other hellish creatures. Sometimes I just want to pass them by and get to where I&rsquo;m going. </p>



<h2 id="it-has-an-8-second-cool-down">It has an 8 second cool down</h2>



<p>You know what&rsquo;s worse than your horse throwing you into a throng of angry demons? Waiting an eternity to get back on it. The mount has an eight second cool down, during which you&rsquo;re nothing but a punching bag for that massive crowd of monsters. Eight seconds may not seem like a long time to most people, but when you&rsquo;re fighting off a bunch of monsters that are out for your blood, it feels like forever. I&rsquo;ve died so many times because I couldn&rsquo;t immediately summon my horse and make a quick escape. Again, I find it easier to gang up on the mobs with friends or run past them using my dash and dodge abilities. </p>



<h2 id="the-barding-is-the-only-saving-grace">The barding is the only saving grace</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/hashtag/DiabloIV?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=2-3-1945763-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">#DiabloIV</a> They have some really cool cosmetics for characters and your horses. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://t.co/KbClQJYKpl&amp;xcust=2-3-1945763-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/KbClQJYKpl</a></p>&mdash; Encusos (@encusos) <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/encusos/status/1664471168378896385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=2-3-1945763-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">June 2, 2023</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that the horse mount ignites a maddening fury within me. I&rsquo;ve made that abundantly clear. The only thing I like about the horse mount are the barding options you can equip it with. It&rsquo;s basically armor for horses and it&rsquo;s super rad. I mean, who doesn&rsquo;t love a dramatic costume change? </p>



<p>You can either pay real money dollars for the horse armor (don&rsquo;t even get me started on microtransactions) or you can grind away and hope that it drops somewhere in a dungeon. The armor options are cool, but they&rsquo;re just cosmetics, so they have zero impact on the horse&rsquo;s speed or skill. The horse still sucks to use, sure, but at least you can beautify it. </p>

<p>Handheld consoles have been around since the late 1980s, but it recently feels like we&rsquo;ve entered a new era with home console gaming coming to portable devices. </p>



<p>From the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.techadvisor.com/article/717596/nintendo-switch-review.html&amp;xcust=2-3-1951380-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch</a> being the only realistic option for such handheld quality a few years ago, we now have credible competitors from the likes of <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.techadvisor.com/article/744299/valve-steam-deck-everything-you-need-to-know.html&amp;xcust=2-3-1951380-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Valve</a>, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.techadvisor.com/article/1073047/logitech-g-cloud-vs-steam-deck.html&amp;xcust=2-3-1951380-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Logitech</a> and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.techadvisor.com/article/743709/one-xplayer-is-a-high-end-switch-rival-for-aaa-gaming.html&amp;xcust=2-3-1951380-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Onex</a>.&nbsp;These are consoles that don&rsquo;t play traditional physical game cartridges, cards, or discs, but instead stream or download games from services such as Steam or Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<p>But with the ROG Ally, Asus wants to take things to the next level. Unlike rivals, it runs a full version of <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.techadvisor.com/article/743961/microsoft-windows-11.html&amp;xcust=2-3-1951380-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Windows 11</a>, meaning you can play the same range of games as any PC. Alongside dedicated AMD flagship processors and a 120Hz display, Asus means business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But does it live up to the hype, and more importantly, that high price? I believe so, but only if you&rsquo;re willing to fully embrace the handheld form factor and its compromises.</p>



<p><em>This review originally appeared on TechAdvisor.com.</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<h2 class="toc" id="design-build">Design &amp; build</h2>



<ul><li>Premium but bulky design</li><li>Impressive Xbox-style controls</li><li>Good range of ports</li></ul>



<p>The ROG Ally is a real statement of intent from Asus, and that starts with design. It&rsquo;s a bulky, imposing device with a distinctive gaming aesthetic, yet still feels slick enough to have mainstream appeal. I&rsquo;m not hugely into modern gamer aesthetics, but have no issue using this in public.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A reasonably light weight of 608g and thickness of 21.2mm are a big selling point of the Ally, meaning you can take it almost anywhere with you. For context, that&rsquo;s thinner and lighter than the Valve Steam Deck, despite both devices having a 7in display.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But crucially for such an expensive device, the premium look and feel isn&rsquo;t compromised to get there. The white finish won&rsquo;t be to everyone&rsquo;s tastes, but I feel it contributes to a design that&rsquo;s sleek and modern. If you&rsquo;ve used the white <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.techadvisor.com/article/722685/nintendo-switch-oled-review.html&amp;xcust=2-3-1951380-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch OLED</a>, you&rsquo;ll know what I mean.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Ally - back" class="wp-image-1816365" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/asus-rog-ally-review-5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Anyron Copeman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>As good as it looks, though, an alternative colour option would&rsquo;ve been nice. Unlike with phones, you can&rsquo;t just cover it up with a case here. However, the device does a good job of avoiding picking up visible dirt marks, something I was concerned about. Your hands can get sweaty while playing, but it won&rsquo;t show.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the design of the Ally is fairly generic, Asus has still managed to put its own stamp on the device. Small ROG-specific touches can be found across the device, from a large logo on the back to RGB lighting around both joysticks. The latter can quickly become annoying, particularly if you leave it on the default &lsquo;rainbow&rsquo; mode, but this can easily be customised or turned off altogether.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The joysticks themselves are where my thumbs naturally rest, offering a comfortable experience. My only complaint is the lack of padding, which can become uncomfortable when making lots of quick movements.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Ally - side view" class="wp-image-1816368" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/asus-rog-ally-review-8.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Anyron Copeman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>Asus has opted for Xbox-style ABXY buttons in the top-right corner, plus a directional pad diagonally opposite. Both are clicky and responsive, making them easy to press no matter the game.</p>



<p>Triggers and bumpers on the top of the Ally are just as good, but Asus has added a few extra physical buttons of its own. The most notable are two on the back of the device, which the company is calling &lsquo;Macro 1&rsquo; and &lsquo;Macro 2&rsquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;While not relevant in many games, one-tap access to functions of your choice can make a big difference in some titles. It&rsquo;s certainly a nice option to have.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shortcuts to the View, Command Center, Armoury Crate and Menu sections on the front of the device are more mundane, but still worth having.&nbsp;Combined, the physical buttons and joysticks deliver a more convincing experience than even a dedicated controller.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>The physical buttons and joysticks deliver a more convincing experience than even a dedicated controller</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>At the top, the power button doubles as a fingerprint sensor, which is a cool addition. It&rsquo;s quite small, but still relatively fast and reliable. Next to it, you&rsquo;ll find volume controls and a surprisingly good port selection. </p>



<p>Alongside a USB-C port for charging, you get a microSD slot for expandable storage, a 3.5mm audio jack, and dedicated connector for ROG XG Mobile, Asus&rsquo; external GPU system.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Ally - top" class="wp-image-1816371" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/asus-rog-ally-review-7.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Anyron Copeman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>The latter can supposedly deliver a big boost to the already excellent performance, but I wasn&rsquo;t sent one to test out. It also costs well over $1,000/&pound;1,000 and makes the Ally much less portable. For the vast majority of people, it&rsquo;s totally unnecessary.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="toc" id="screen-speakers">Screen &amp; speakers</h2>



<ul><li>7in, Full HD display</li><li>120Hz refresh rate</li><li>Impressive dual speakers</li></ul>



<p>The display on the ROG Ally is one of its key strengths. It&rsquo;s a 7in, Full HD (1920&times;1080) IPS touchscreen, complete with Gorilla Glass Victus for extra durability. That resolution gives it a classic 16:9 aspect ratio, meaning almost all games can run natively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s a real step up from the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.techadvisor.com/article/744299/valve-steam-deck-everything-you-need-to-know.html&amp;xcust=2-3-1951380-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Steam Deck</a> and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.techadvisor.com/article/722685/nintendo-switch-oled-review.html&amp;xcust=2-3-1951380-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch OLED</a>, which are both limited to 720p output. You also get a 120Hz refresh rate on the Ally, rather than the standard 60Hz on the other devices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With all that in mind, it&rsquo;ll come as no surprise to learn that the display here is a joy to use. Gameplay looks superb, with rich, vibrant colours and lots of detail. On a screen of this size, you certainly don&rsquo;t need a higher resolution.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Ally - gameplay" class="wp-image-1816390" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/asus-rog-ally-review-9.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Anyron Copeman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>When loading up a game for the first time, I was genuinely shocked by how good the screen looked. It&rsquo;s not quite high-end PC or TV console level, but it&rsquo;s not far off. This is a premium display.</p>



<p>Prior to testing, I was concerned about how the LCD panel here would compare to OLED. But darker colours and contrast are still impressive on the ROG Ally, and it doesn&rsquo;t feel like you&rsquo;re missing out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>When loading up a game for the first time, I was genuinely shocked by how good the screen looked</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>The display&rsquo;s 7ms response time isn&rsquo;t the greatest by PC gaming standards, but there was no noticeable input lag while playing. Only avid gamers will observe any difference compared to more responsive screens.</p>



<p>Given how portable the Ally is, you might want to use it outside. A maximum brightness of 502 nits means that&rsquo;s very much possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My only complaint here is the bezels, which are much thicker than they need to be. There&rsquo;s a ROG logo below the screen, but no webcam at the top &ndash; there&rsquo;s no camera at all. This is a shame. Unlike a tablet, there&rsquo;s plenty of space to comfortably hold the device already, so Asus has no real excuse for not squeezing one in.</p>



<p>However, the ROG Ally does benefit from dual stereo speakers, which emit sound from both the front and back of the device. The room-filling audio they provide is solid, considering the size of the device, with an impressive depth to music and sound effects.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Ally - speakers" class="wp-image-1816392" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/asus-rog-ally-review-6.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Anyron Copeman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>In-game character voices sound crystal-clear too, though an extra hit of bass and higher max volume would be nice. For the best experience, you&rsquo;ll still need to connect headphones &ndash; whether they&rsquo;re wired (via the 3.5mm jack) or wireless (via Bluetooth).</p>



<h2 class="toc" id="specs-gaming-performance">Specs &amp; gaming performance</h2>



<ul><li>AMD Ryzen Z1 and Radeon graphics</li><li>Superb, console-level performance</li><li>Limited storage, but microSD expansion</li></ul>



<p>Asus has made a big deal of the performance abilities of the ROG Ally, and it&rsquo;s easy to see why.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The device is powered by the Ryzen Z1 Series, new AMD chips that are specifically designed for handheld consoles. Asus claims both Ryzen Z1 and Z1 Extreme models offer flagship-level performance, but only the latter is coming to the UK &ndash; it&rsquo;s the version I&rsquo;ve been testing.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Ally - key specs" class="wp-image-1816401" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/asus-rog-ally-review-10.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption> The resolution can be increased to 1920&times;1080 in Settings</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Anyron Copeman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>While integrated AMD Radeon graphics and 16GB of DDR5 RAM (on both models) doesn&rsquo;t sound particularly impressive, the results are. Performance is excellent, and in line with <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.techadvisor.com/article/725004/best-cheap-gaming-laptop.html&amp;xcust=2-3-1951380-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">cheap gaming laptops</a> in the &pound;600-&pound;800 price range &ndash; as the benchmarks below show:</p>








<p>Crucially, that&rsquo;s reflected in real-world usage. I tried some of the most demanding PC games you can play, across three of the most popular platforms: Xbox Game Pass, EA Play and Steam. Everything runs very smoothly at 1080p, with gameplay looking superb on the ROG Ally&rsquo;s excellent display.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s not quite as good as&nbsp;a full PC gaming rig or next-gen console, but you won&rsquo;t be disappointed by the performance on offer here. There are no noticeable dropped frames, even during fast-paced action games. According to Asus, a June 2023 update supposedly increases framerates by around 10-20%, boosting performance even further.</p>



<p>Hesitations and lag aren&rsquo;t an issue while playing games, and bugs elsewhere seem related to software rather than hardware. I highly doubt more power would change anything, and it&rsquo;s worth putting up with them for the superb in-game performance.</p>



<p>One feature which can sometimes be overlooked is the vibration motor. It&rsquo;s excellent here, offering subtle feedback that really enhances the gaming experience.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Everything runs very smoothly at 1080p, with gameplay looking superb</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>After only a couple of minutes of playing, there was a noticeable build-up of heat. But the advanced cooling system means the Ally only ever gets warm to the touch, with both fans on the back of the device where they won&rsquo;t be covered by your hands. Even when in full flow, they don&rsquo;t get too loud &ndash; Asus claims a maximum of just 20dB.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike the Nintendo Switch, you have to keep the ROG Ally in one piece at all times. The controllers aren&rsquo;t detachable, although you do have the option to connect it to a TV or monitor via HDMI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It works seamlessly, with great picture quality and no drop in performance. But the feature relies on the ROG Gaming Charger Dock, which costs &pound;60 extra in the UK. Simply including an HDMI port on the device itself would&rsquo;ve solved this problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In terms of connectivity, the ROG Ally features both Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2. There&rsquo;s no cellular connectivity, but it&rsquo;s easy to hotspot from your phone while out and about.&nbsp;This isn&rsquo;t a great way to game though, as hotspotting to a phone is not a fast way to stream games and is not a method I recommend relying on. If you want to stream games, this is only realistically possible on good Wi-Fi. </p>



<p>The upcoming Android-based <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.techadvisor.com/article/1446639/razer-edge.html&amp;xcust=2-3-1951380-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Razer Edge</a> has a 5G option, but that device is much less powerful than the ROG Ally.</p>



<p>The ROG Ally Z1 version includes a 256GB SSD, while the Z1 Extreme model I tested increases that to 512GB. But with around 54GB taken up by Windows system files, it doesn&rsquo;t leave much room for games.</p>



<p>Even with only five games installed, I got a pop-up message saying insufficient storage when trying to download a sixth. Most titles I played, including FIFA 22, F1 22 and Call of Duty: Warzone, were between 50-100GB. But some &ndash; such as Forza Horizon 5 &ndash; were significantly higher.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Ally - FIFA 22" class="wp-image-1816404" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/asus-rog-ally-review-12.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Anyron Copeman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>Thankfully, the storage capacity can be expanded via microSD, but it&rsquo;s another separate purchase.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="toc" id="software">Software</h2>



<ul><li>Runs Windows 11 Home</li><li>Access to full range of PC games</li><li>Lots of software bugs</li></ul>



<p>A key advantage of the ROG Ally compared to other handheld consoles is software. It runs a full version of <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.techadvisor.com/article/743961/microsoft-windows-11.html&amp;xcust=2-3-1951380-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Windows 11</a> Home, meaning you have full access to the same range of games as a PC.&nbsp;You can use several different game services, and you aren&rsquo;t tied to one company&rsquo;s. </p>



<p>The great advantage of the ROG Ally is you can stream games if you go via a cloud gaming service, or play using on-device downloads. It&rsquo;s best with the latter, but having the option is a luxury.</p>



<p>Whether you use Steam, Xbox Game Pass, the Epic Games Store&nbsp;or even a cloud gaming service, they&rsquo;ll all work on the ROG Ally. All your downloaded games can be accessed via the Armoury Crate SE app, which opens by default when you turn on the device.</p>



<p>It acts as a simple app launcher, but also a hub for the extensive customisation options available. You can adjust controls, performance, lighting, display and audio, most of which can also be accessed via the dedicated Command Center button mid-game. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Ally - Command Center" class="wp-image-1817703" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/asus-rog-ally-review-11.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Anyron Copeman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>You will need to make sure the gamepad is selected&nbsp;for many games, with keyboard and mouse often set as the default. But changing all these settings feels slick and intuitive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sadly, the same can&rsquo;t be said for the rest of the Windows 11 experience. Microsoft&rsquo;s operating system isn&rsquo;t optimised to run on this type of hardware, and it shows. &nbsp;</p>



<p>I ran into dozens of bugs and issues during my testing time, from app crashes and stuttering to games that simply refused to display in full screen. On a couple of occasions, the screen wouldn&rsquo;t turn on at all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of these were resolved within a couple of minutes, but it&rsquo;s frustrating to encounter them so frequently. As good as the gaming is, software bugs appear to be part and parcel of the ROG Ally experience at launch. I could fix every bug by closing or minimising other apps and restarting software, but it was very frustrating. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>As good as the gaming is, software bugs are part and parcel of the ROG Ally experience</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>But the benefits of Windows 11 can just about outweigh the drawbacks. You will just need to be patient when loading games, though.</p>



<h2 class="toc" id="battery-life-charging">Battery life &amp; charging</h2>



<ul><li>40Wh battery</li><li>Less than two hours of gaming per charge</li><li>Fast 65W charging</li></ul>



<p>Battery life is the biggest reason not to buy the ROG Ally. It has a 40Wh cell, but clearly that&rsquo;s not big enough for 1080p gaming on a 120Hz display. &nbsp;</p>



<p>I fully charged the device before each gaming session, yet would always hit 0% in less than two hours. It didn&rsquo;t matter which game I played &ndash; all AAA titles deplete the battery extremely quickly. </p>



<p>This is somewhat to be expected given the size of the battery and the power needed to drive PC-level gaming. But this console can&rsquo;t even last a short haul flight before needing a charge, which defeats the point &ndash; and the joy &ndash; if gaming on the go.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Ally - battery information" class="wp-image-1817712" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/asus-rog-ally-review-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Anyron Copeman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>The <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.techadvisor.com/article/717596/nintendo-switch-review.html&amp;xcust=2-3-1951380-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch</a> can hit about six hours at best, which is much better. Granted, those games are simpler and not PC-level, but if you want true portability then this is where the compromise seems to be at the moment for such consoles; simpler games with good battery life, or PC-level games with terrible battery life. </p>



<p>A 720p video loop test at 120 nits of brightness isn&rsquo;t particularly relevant here, but a time of just five hours is well behind any Windows laptop we&rsquo;ve reviewed. Having to worry about battery life so much rather defeats the point of a portable console.&nbsp;A June 2023 update supposedly improves it by around 10-20% compared to when I reviewed the device, but it doesn&rsquo;t stop battery life from being a key weakness.</p>



<p>Of course, there are things you can do to prolong it. Dropping down to 720p gameplay or 60Hz refresh rate will mean the ROG Ally lasts longer, as will lowering the brightness. But the gaming experience is nowhere near as good when you reduce these settings. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Having to worry about battery life so much rather defeats the point of a portable console</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>At least charging speeds are decent. The 65W adapter included in the box can charge the Ally to 54% in 30 minutes and 89% in 1 hour, with a full charge taking around 1 hour 45 minutes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But when the battery lasts about the same length of time it takes to charge, this is scant consolation. As is playing the thing constantly plugged into the mains, which is possible. </p>



<h2 class="toc" id="price-availability">Price &amp; availability</h2>



<p>Poor battery life might not be a dealbreaker for you, but the price of the ROG Ally could be.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A regular Z1 version with a 256GB SSD will cost $599.99, although this model marked as &lsquo;Coming Soon&rsquo; at <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fasus-rog-ally-7-120hz-fhd-1080p-gaming-handheld-amd-ryzen-z1-processor-512gb-white%2F6543664.p%3FskuId%3D6543664&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Best Buy</a>. It&rsquo;s expected sometime in Q3 (July-September) in the US, but there&rsquo;s no word on when (or if) it&rsquo;ll arrive in the UK or mainland Europe.</p>



<p>Both models are significantly more expensive than the $399/&pound;349 starting price of the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.techadvisor.com/article/744299/valve-steam-deck-everything-you-need-to-know.html&amp;xcust=2-3-1951380-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam Deck</a>, although there are more expensive models.

<p>There are other affordable options worth considering, although none can match the performance and feature set of the ROG Ally. It just comes down to whether you&rsquo;re willing to pay the premium for it.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="toc" id="verdict">Verdict</h2>



<p>With the ROG Ally, Asus has taken handheld console gaming to the next level, but with it highlighted the compromises still needed in the category.</p>



<p>Dedicated AMD CPUs deliver top-tier performance across all the most demanding games, while the 120Hz touchscreen is a joy to behold. Xbox-style controls are familiar and easy to use, even if they can&rsquo;t be detached.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The device is relatively light and comfortable to hold, while Windows 11 means you have access to the full range of PC games. However, the general software experience is buggy at times, and battery life is terrible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Are you willing to put up with those compromises at this price? That&rsquo;s down to you. The ROG Ally, despite these downsides, is one of the best handheld gaming consoles you can buy.</p>

<p>Despite making concessions to any state-level agency that will listen, Microsoft&rsquo;s would-be purchase of mega-game publisher Activision Blizzard continues to run into regulatory hurdles. The latest obstacle for the deal is the United States Federal Trade Commission, which has filed an injunction and restraining order to block the nearly $70 billion purchase from going through. The following proceedings will determine whether the US government allows the largest deal in video game history to proceed. </p>

Essentially, the FTC had already signaled its opposition to the Microsoft-Activision deal on anti-trust grounds <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1430050/ftc-sues-to-block-microsofts-activision-gaming-deal.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">late last year</a> but had not completed the process of formally blocking the merger. This injunction, if approved by a federal judge, will stop the merger dead in its tracks until a trial to determine its legality proceeds. Microsoft and Activision had reportedly been planning to finalize the purchase in July, dealing with the legal fallout afterward&hellip;and potentially making it much harder for regulators to undo. </p>



<p>Many analysts had expected Microsoft&rsquo;s purchase to sail through a merger-friendly US federal system, as has been the case in the video game industry for years. Microsoft&rsquo;s recent publisher and developer purchases include Obsidian, Double Fine, and Zenimax, bolstering an impressive first-party stable for the PC and Xbox platforms. Adding Activision and Blizzard would give Microsoft control of such enormous gaming franchises as <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>Diablo,</em> and <em>World of Warcraft</em>. This seems to be one step too far in consolidation for the FTC, much like when AT&amp;T attempted to purchase T-Mobile and essentially turn the US mobile phone service landscape into a duopoly. </p>



<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s troubles don&rsquo;t end at American borders. The deal has also been <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1799666/uk-blocks-microsoft-activision-deal-to-protect-cloud-gaming.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">blocked by regulators in the United Kingdom</a>, on fears that Microsoft&rsquo;s dominant position in the emerging streaming/cloud gaming category could create an unstoppable giant that&rsquo;s impossible for smaller companies to compete with. Microsoft is appealing the UK ruling (which has the potential to scupper the deal altogether) and &ldquo;welcomes the opportunity to present our case in federal court&rdquo; in response to the FTC motion.  </p>

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>AMD is stepping on the gas with its new Ryzen Pro 7040 processors for both business laptops and desktops, injecting Zen 4 CPU technology and RDNA 3 graphics architecture for increased performance. AI, too, will play a role, with some improvements for video calls to clients and partners.</p>



<p>The fine print, though, reveals a small penalty: While <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/633153/amd-ryzen-6000-pro-series-is-ready-to-super-charge-high-end-laptops.html">last year&rsquo;s Ryzen Pro 6000</a> models were designed for both 35W to 45W laptops as well as thinner 15W to 30W and 10W to 25W thin-and-light laptops, AMD&rsquo;s latest chips require more power. The high-end 8-core/16-thread Ryzen 9 Pro 7940HS consumes 35W to 54W of power, and there&rsquo;s only a single second tier of chips for laptops that consume between 15W and 28W.</p>



<p>Still, AMD claims that its new Ryzen Pro 7040 processors can actually outperform an Apple Mac not on performance, but on battery life. (While AMD refers to its mobile family as <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444850/amd-launches-mobile-ryzen-7000-cpus-prepping-for-an-ai-future.html">the Ryzen 7000 Mobile series</a>, the Ryzen 7040 series are the specific &ldquo;Phoenix&rdquo; chips designed for thin-and-light notebooks. The Pro 7040 series are the commercial offshoots for business notebooks.)</p>



<p>AMD unveiled six new Ryzen 9 Pro processors, and three new Ryzen Pro desktop chips. AMD&rsquo;s Matthew Unangst, senior director of its commercial client and workstation business, also declined to confirm reports that AMD was extending the longevity of the AM5 desktop socket until 2026. Instead, he claimed that there had been no change to the company&rsquo;s previous guidance and that it would last until at least 2025.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AMD Ryzen Pro 7040 7000" class="wp-image-1948475" height="626" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ryzen-Pro-7040-speeds-and-feeds.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>AMD&rsquo;s new Ryzen Pro 7040 mobile processors.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">AMD</p></div>



<p>AMD&rsquo;s new commercial Ryzen 7040 CPUs include the Ryzen 9 Pro 7940HS, the Ryzen 7 Pro 7840HS, the Ryzen 5 Pro 7640HS, plus the three U-series chips: the Ryzen 7 Pro 7840U, Ryzen 5 Pro 7640U, and the Ryzen 5 Pro 7540U. The fastest Ryzen 9 Pro 7940HS incudes 8 cores and 16 threads, and boosts from a base clock of 4.0GHz to 5.2GHz. The difference between the standard Ryzen 7040 Mobile chips and the new Ryzen Pro series are security &mdash; there&rsquo;s an integrated Pluton core inside &mdash; and additional manageability features.</p>



<p>From a performance standpoint, AMD is claiming that its new Ryzen Pro chips will compete favorably with Intel&rsquo;s 13th-generation mobile processors in terms of performance, even challenging one of Intel&rsquo;s 13th-gen &ldquo;P&rdquo; performance processors with its own low-power &ldquo;U&rdquo; cores.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AMD Ryzen Pro 7040 7000" class="wp-image-1948471" height="624" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ryzen-Pro-7040-performance.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>How AMD sees the new 7040 Pro comparing to Intel&rsquo;s 13th-gen chips.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">AMD</p></div>



<p>AMD also believes that the Ryzen Pro 7040 processors have several advantages in business computers. For one, AMD claims to have held tests with multi-hour Microsoft Teams calls. Its own laptops lasted the longest, even outlasting the Apple M2 Pro and handily outperforming it by 5 to 18 percent.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Select models&rdquo; of the Ryzen Pro 7040 series include an XDNA core, the Ryzen AI technology that AMD has shown off previously. For now, Ryzen AI and XDNA are limited to accelerating and enabling Windows Studio Effects, the technologies that debuted in Qualcomm Snapdragon-powered devices like the Surface Pro 9 (5G). Windows Studio Effects include face tracking and framing, background blur, plus some audio filtering. The hope, though, is that AMD will be at the forefront of helping whatever AI technologies emerge, whether it be machine vision or content creation. </p>

<p>AMD debuted the Ryzen AI and its XDNA technology inside the Ryzen 7940HS, 7840HS, and 7640HS and the comparable U-series parts. AMD hasn&rsquo;t confirmed the exact versions of the Pro series that will include XDNA cores, but the comparable Pro 7940HS, the Pro 7840U and Pro 7840HS, the Pro 7640U and Pro 7640HS are likely.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re helping lead an industry and an ecosystem around the development of AI technologies,&rdquo; Unangst said. Still, he added, AMD&rsquo;s AI &rdquo; journey has a lot of unknowns.&rdquo; </p>



<p>AMD said notebooks like the HP Elitebook 865/845/835 series, Lenovo ThinkPad Z13/Z16, and more would use AMD&rsquo;s chips.</p>



<h2 id="amd-adds-desktop-ryzen-pro-chips">AMD adds desktop Ryzen Pro chips</h2>



<p>AMD&rsquo;s desktop version of the Ryzen Pro is all based around 65W parts. The three chips (the Ryzen 9 Pro 7945, the Ryzen 7 Pro 7745, and the Ryzen 5 Pro 7645, are all built on AMD&rsquo;s 5nm process, with clock speeds up to 5.7GHz and core counts up to 12 cores and 24 threads.</p>

<p>Unangst was asked about how long the AM5 socket would persist, especially as a version of his slide deck noted that it would be supported until &ldquo;2025+&rdquo;.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to work with our partners and with our customers,&rdquo; Unangst said. &ldquo;But we feel very confident at this point that we can commit to at least 2025. And as we look at the situation we&rsquo;ll communicate as we figure out what we&rsquo;re going to do for 2026 and beyond.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A dedicated sound card always &ldquo;sounds&rdquo; better than an integrated sound chip on the motherboard! A PC with extra RAM is always &ldquo;faster&rdquo; than a PC with less RAM! A long HDMI cable is bad for picture quality!</p>



<p>Who hasn&rsquo;t heard these &ldquo;wisdoms&rdquo; about PC hardware and peripherals? But do these bits of &ldquo;expert knowledge,&rdquo; usually expounded by &ldquo;real tech professionals,&rdquo; actually correspond to the truth?</p>



<p>Our editorial team set out to provide answers and explain the technical background of these myths, fables, and legends that have been established for years.</p>



<p><em>This article was translated from German to English, and originally appeared on pcwelt.de.</em></p>



<h2 class="toc" id="myth-1-dedicated-sound-cards-always-sound-better-than-onboard-audio-chips">Myth 1: Dedicated sound cards always sound better than onboard audio chips!</h2>



<p>Again and again you can find people saying that a dedicated sound card should always sound better than an onboard integrated sound chip on the motherboard. But is this really true?</p>



<p>Whether a dedicated sound card sounds better than an onboard audio chip depends on many different factors. As a general rule, sound cards do in fact offer higher sampling rates and better resolution than onboard chips. The processing of audio signals can also be better with dedicated sound cards due to a higher-quality audio processor.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>However, modern onboard sound chips often already deliver such high audio quality that differences in sound are only &ldquo;audible&rdquo; to professional users with the appropriate hi-fi or studio equipment. So if you&rsquo;re not doing professional audio work or have a high-end audio setup, it may not be essential to use a dedicated sound card.</p>



<p>Additionally, it&rsquo;s important to note that a dedicated sound card is an extra component in your computer that requires space and power. If you have a laptop or a small case, this of course can be a problem.</p>



<p>Ultimately, the decision between a dedicated sound card and an onboard sound chip depends on your specific needs and budget. If you choose a dedicated sound card, it&rsquo;s advisable to read ratings and reviews and make sure the card is compatible with your system.</p>



<p><strong>Answer: </strong>So, do dedicated sound cards necessarily sound better than onboard sound chips? Yes&hellip; and no. Dedicated sound cards usually have better specifications on paper, but these can typically only be distinguished when using specific applications and with the appropriate equipment and accessories. </p>



<h2 class="toc" id="myth-2-more-ram-makes-your-pc-faster">Myth 2: More RAM makes your PC faster!</h2>



<p>Next to the main processor, aka CPU, the RAM is one of the most important components in a PC. But what is the truth behind the statement that more RAM also basically makes your PC faster?</p>



<p>PC performance can benefit from an increase in RAM, but other factors are also important and can affect speed.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Gaming-PC DDR5-RAM " class="wp-image-1919653" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/pcw06_DDR5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Trident</p></div>



<p>With insufficient memory, the operating system must constantly move data back and forth between memory and the hard drive to make room for new applications and data. This process, also called swapping, can affect the speed of the computer because the hard disk is slower compared to your main system memory.</p>



<p>However, if a PC already has a sufficient amount of RAM, more RAM does not necessarily make the PC faster. That said, the RAM&rsquo;s memory clock (ex. DDR4-<em>2666</em> or DDR4-<em>3200</em>) is also important and shouldn&rsquo;t be neglected.</p>



<p>Currently it can be said that the following amounts of RAM are sufficient:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Office PC:</strong> 8 gigabytes of RAM</li><li><strong>Multimedia PC:</strong> 16 gigabytes of RAM</li><li><strong>Workstation PC:</strong> 32 to 64 gigabytes of RAM</li><li><strong>Gaming PC: </strong>16 to 32 gigabytes of RAM</li></ul>



<p><strong>Answer: </strong>No, more RAM does not generally make a PC faster. If a PC has enough RAM, adding more RAM will not speed it up any further. You either have enough, or you don&rsquo;t.</p>



<p>Rather, the speed and memory clock, should be taken into account. In modern computer systems, this should not be less than 2,666 MT/s (DDR4-2666) or, even better, 3,200 MT/s (DDR4-3200). Current gaming PCs have already made the switch to the new DDR5 standard with at least 4,800 MT/s. For much more info, check out our guide on <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/541506/how-to-choose-the-right-ram.html">how to choose the right RAM for your PC</a>.</p>



<h2 class="toc" id="myth-3-a-long-hdmi-cable-is-bad-for-picture-quality">Myth 3: A long HDMI cable is bad for picture quality!</h2>



<p>Along with DisplayPorts, HDMI connections are a prime choice for connecting your monitor to your PC. Be careful though! Supposedly, long HDMI cables have a negative effect on picture quality&mdash;but is this statement even true?</p>

<p>In truly exceptional cases, the quality of an HDMI signal (and thus the picture quality) can indeed be impaired due to possible signal losses and interference if the cable is too long, or if inferior materials have been used.</p>



<p>As a general rule, HDMI cables should be no longer than 15 meters, or approximately 50 feet, to minimize signal loss and interference. But the length as such has no negative influence on the picture quality that can be achieved via HDMI. As long as the signal holds up, you&rsquo;re good, regardless of length.</p>



<p><strong>Answer: </strong>As a rule, particularly long HDMI cables do not have a negative effect on picture quality as long as they are high-quality cables that are designed for the corresponding resolution and transmission speeds.

<p>The clock frequency of a CPU indicates how many switching or clock cycles the processor executes or processes per second. A CPU with a higher clock frequency therefore executes more switching cycles per second than one with a lower clock frequency. However, the clock frequency is not the only feature that influences the performance of a CPU.</p>



<p>There are many other factors that affect the performance of a CPU, such as:</p>



<ul><li>Number of processor cores</li><li>Size of the L1 cache</li><li>Size of the L2 cache</li><li>Size of the L3 cache</li><li>Hyperthreading support</li><li>Architecture of the CPU and its pipelines</li></ul>



<p>Therefore, it&rsquo;s important for users not to focus solely on the clock frequency of a CPU, but also to consider other features to decide which processor is best suited for certain applications.</p>



<p><strong>Answer: </strong>No, the clock frequency alone does not give any information about the performance of a CPU and only serves as a rough guide. It can also be useful to differentiate between several processors within a product family. Check out our roundup of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/401980/best-cpus-for-gaming.html">the best gaming CPUs</a> for a more holistic list of recommendations based on real-world performance.</p>



<h2 class="toc" id="myth-5-overclocking-damages-your-hardware-and-shortens-the-lifespan">Myth 5: Overclocking damages your hardware and shortens the lifespan!</h2>



<p>Overclocking your PC hardware can lead to higher performance if you run components such as the CPU, GPU or RAM at higher clock frequencies than intended by the manufacturer (&ldquo;overclocking&rdquo;). But this also increases heat generation and the power load on the components, which can lead to a higher risk of failure and in some cases even damage.</p>



<p>That said, if overclocking is done carefully and responsibly by monitoring temperatures and staying within the recommended limits of the hardware, there is usually no chance of immediate damage.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also important to note that every system is unique and not all hardware components can be overclocked equally. Therefore, it may take some time and expertise to achieve the best overclocking result for a particular system.</p>



<p><strong>Answer: </strong>So does overclocking harm your hardware? It can if you&rsquo;re not careful! But modern hardware usually has overclocking headroom built in; since some individual silicon chips run faster than others, stock frequencies tend to be conservative. Manufacturers also publish critical temperature and power limits for chips, which overclocking software adheres to unless you blow past warning screens. Stick to safe overclocks and you shouldn&rsquo;t risk damaging your PC. Nvidia, AMD, and Intel all offer overclocking tools for a reason. If chips blew up left and right, they wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>Overclocking can lead to the warranty of the components being voided if overclocking is considered a violation of the warranty conditions. The editorial team at PC-Welt and PCWorld accepts no responsibility for any overclocking attempts.</em></p></blockquote>



<h2 class="toc" id="myth-6-if-the-pc-isnt-shut-down-properly-youll-damage-it">Myth 6: If the PC isn&rsquo;t shut down properly, you&rsquo;ll damage it!</h2>



<p>Does it really damage the hardware if you don&rsquo;t shut down a PC and simply turn off the power supply?</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s advisable to shut down a PC if it is not going to be used for a long time. That&rsquo;s primarily to save energy however. You can also put your PC permanently into standby or sleep mode; here, too, the hardware is not stressed and the consumption of modern systems in these modes is now in the range of 0.x watts. </p>



<p>But what about when you don&rsquo;t shut down your PC and instead simply turn off the power supply?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Yes and no! </p>



<p>Yes, it can harm your PC if you take it off power without shutting it down first. If the PC is suddenly disconnected from power, all running processes and applications are abruptly terminated, which can lead to data loss. It can also damage the structure of the operating system and its boot loader, which means that the PC may no longer boot up properly. The consequence: The operating system may have to be reinstalled.</p>



<p>No, the hardware itself is not damaged by this. There is no threat of hardware components such as the CPU, GPU, RAM, or SSD becoming defective. Nevertheless, a PC should always be shut down or at least put into standby mode due to the reasons mentioned above. Simply disconnecting it from the power should absolutely be avoided.</p>

## Hey Microsoft: Please resurrect this dead, yet deeply useful PowerToy

<p>The PCWorld staff loves Microsoft&rsquo;s PowerToys. These utilities supercharge Windows, adding functionality that simplifies getting stuff done. We&rsquo;re always excited when new ones come down the pipeline, because the tools are so genuinely helpful.</p>



<p>But I have one complaint about them&mdash;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/563788/seven-ways-in-which-microsofts-powertoys-improves-my-life.html">the current lineup</a> doesn&rsquo;t include one of my favorites, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SyncToy&amp;xcust=2-1-1948554-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">SyncToy</a>. Released in 2009, it lets you synchronize folders on your PC. It was last updated in 2010, then languished until Microsoft finally took the download page offline in 2021.</p>



<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s right&mdash;PowerToys go much further back than Windows 10. They actually got their start during the Windows 95 era. (Yep, it&rsquo;s been decades. Sorry if you weren&rsquo;t ready for the unwanted reminder of your mortality; I didn&rsquo;t like it either.) Many of the older ones have died natural deaths because their related function became a relic of the past (CD usage, for example) or because they got replaced with native Windows features (like previewing RAW format images). But SyncToy is still relevant today, and it doesn&rsquo;t have a good replacement within Windows.</p>



<p>As a result, I&rsquo;ve been living a bit like Miss Havisham of <em>Great Expectations</em>, still very much keeping the past alive and refusing to move forward. I still use SyncToy several times a week to keep select folders mirrored between different cloud providers on my PC, as well as a local folder. (One option in SyncToy lets you &ldquo;contribute&rdquo; from one folder to another as a one-way sync, so that everything but deletions in the first folder are reflected in the second folder.) The tool is extremely simple, but it has the exact utility I want without any interface clutter or extra bloat. It&rsquo;s hard to let go of.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="SyncToy folder pair setup screen (gray background)" class="wp-image-1948561" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/synctoy3.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Yeah, it looks like it belongs to 2009, but I love SyncToy for what it does.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<p>But while I&rsquo;m okay with SyncToy&rsquo;s minimalist vibe (including full manual controls), a more modern version would be a good thing. I&rsquo;m on borrowed time. I can still install SyncToy on current Windows systems, since older PowerToys were standalone bits of software. (The Windows 10 and 11 version of PowerToys is a single app that manages all the different utilities.) However, it&rsquo;s obviously not designed for newer versions of Windows&mdash;a recent update to Windows 11 partially breaks it. And it requires the installation of .NET Framework 3.5, which is long in the tooth these days.</p>



<p>Transitioning to other software (like backup software that does file synchronization) is an obvious alternative. I&rsquo;ll have to do something if Windows 11 continues to break SyncToy&mdash;Windows 10 gets sunset in 2025, so I can&rsquo;t stay on that OS forever. And that plan can no longer be &ldquo;Plant extra copies of the SyncToy installation file in various cloud storage accounts and keep this <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://download.cnet.com/SyncToy-64-Bit/3000-2248_4-75289467.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1948554-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">download.com</a> page bookmarked.&rdquo; With Microsoft already talking about beefing up <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1930130/windows-backup-app-debuts-alongside-a-taskbar-update-users-begged-for.html">Windows 11&rsquo;s backup options</a>, this seems like the perfect side bonus to complement those new features.</p>



<p>In the meantime, I should probably get started with my replacement research. Waiting until the last minute to find a perfect Goldilocks solution won&rsquo;t work out in my favor, if experience has taught me anything. But you know what? My wish for <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/606964/hey-microsoft-you-know-whatd-make-windows-11-irresistible-universal-control-over-rgb.html">RGB lighting controls</a> in Windows 11 is <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1928248/dynamic-lighting-will-be-windows-tool-to-manage-your-pcs-bling.html">coming true</a>, so maybe it pays to put your dreams out into the world.</p>
