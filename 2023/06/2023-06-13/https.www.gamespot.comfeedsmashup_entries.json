href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-season-5-features-fantasy-role-playing-battle-pass-and-events/1100-6515137/\">Overwatch 2 Season 5</a> has arrived, bringing a new battle pass, which is themed around fantasy tabletop roleplaying games. This means fantasy skins for characters like Orisa, Genji, and Kiriko, in addition to the Mythic skin for Tracer. The Season 5 battle pass also brings a few changes compared to the previous four seasons. Instead of the Mythic skin being at tier 80, which would unlock all customization options for it, it is split into tiers 45, 65, and 80, with each tier unlocking more customization options.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">There is also story content set up around this season's battle pass, featuring a Dungeons and Dragons-like game being run by Tracer for some of the other members of the Overwatch team. At certain tiers in the battle pass, you gain the next chunk of story, which you can view from the battle pass menu.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">There is not a new hero this season, but there are two events to look forward to. The first event is the return of The Summer Games, which will bring the limited-time mode L\u00facio Ball back and introduce a new volleyball mode. This event is also when the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OWCavalry/status/1668319601073979413\">Lifeguard Mercy skin</a> will be available in the shop. The second event is Mischief and Magic, which will bring even more fantasy cosmetics and Overwatch 2's version of a Prop Hunt game mode.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Down below you can see what items you unlock at each tier in the premium Overwatch 2 battle pass, including skins, highlight intros, emotes, icons, and more.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img

Not much stands out from this group at first glance aside from Optimus Prime--but, like every other battle pass collaboration in Chapter 4, his style options are severely lacking.</p><p>But this is still a quality group, and it's a lineup that holds a specific appeal to me because all but one of the new original characters looks like they walked into this game from a JRPG. Even Optimus Prime first appeared on screen as an anime character, so it's not like he breaks that mold, really.</p><p>All of which is to say that this group of new Fortnite skins has a surprisingly compelling aesthetic, and there are at least four or five that are going to end up as common choices for main skins well after this season ends. Now, let's argue about which ones are the best.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>8.

Lorenzo's story implications are more interesting than this skin is--he's likely the same person as Renzo from last season's pass, and the Ageless Champion from the Season 1 pass, and by extension Geno, the founder of the Imagined Order. But that's a story for another article.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7.

Epic didn't start including one every season until Chapter 3 Season 4, but this is the first time in that span that the reactivity is actually prominent in the design of the skin.

What if I told you this skin was an homage to Final Fantasy XIII-2, and that the two main styles represented Noel and Serah from that game, and the transformation emote was a nod to how that game let you switch between them at any time? I don't know if it's true, but it's what I choose to believe.</p></h3></p><br />", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-chapter-4-season-3-battle-pass-skins-ranked/2900-4774/", "date_published": "2023-06-13 20:20:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "The New Forza Motorsport Makes Smart Changes To Career Mode and AI", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">After about six years and a couple of entries in the <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/forza-horizon-5/\">Forza Horizon series</a>, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/forza-motorsport/\">Forza Motorsport</a> is making a comeback this year. The sim-racing franchise, focused on realism and professional tracks, will be one of Xbox's 2023 heavy hitters, but I'd been wondering what's actually new for this entry. As a long-time racing enthusiast dating back to the <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/gran-turismo/\">first Gran Turismo</a>, I've seen how the genre has evolved and, at points, stagnated. But from what I've seen so far, Forza Motorsport is fine-tuning the racing sim formula in smart ways by dialing in on two major areas: its career mode's gameplay loop and its driver AI behavior.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Following the Xbox Games Showcase during Summer Game Fest, I was able to get a hands-off demo of Forza Motorsport and see the new sim racer in action. The emphasis was on the Builder's Cup Series, which is a career-style mode filled with racing events featuring certain conditions, restrictions, and challenges, as your typical sim-racing campaign would have. The key difference is in how progression works.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Instead of racing to rack up money to spend on upgrades, you earn credits called Car Points, which is akin to XP or skill points in an RPG. Your allotment of Car Points lets you pick and choose which upgrades you want for your car without having to commit to them since you're not necessarily \"purchasing\" parts. Using certain car parts means spending Car Points to equip them, but if you switch it out to a better part or back to stock, you get the Car Points back. It's like being able to respec your character in an RPG without consequence. You're effectively creating a \"build\" for your car in the RPG sense, letting you spec out your car without buyer's remorse.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-new-forza-motorsport-makes-smart-changes-to-career-mode-and-ai/1100-6515194/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-new-forza-motorsport-makes-smart-changes-to-career-mode-and-ai/1100-6515194/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-06-13 20:07:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "McDonald's Made A Grimace Game For Some Reason", "description": "<p>To honor Grimace's 52nd birthday, McDonald's has released a free-to-play <a href=\"https://grimacesbirthday.com/\">Game Boy Color game</a> that can also be played on your PC or mobile device.</p><p>The game is called Grimace's Birthday (via <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/mcdonalds-grimaces-birthday-gameboy-free-game-pc-1850534656\">Kotaku</a>) and it was made by a Brooklyn-based indie studio, Krool Toys.
