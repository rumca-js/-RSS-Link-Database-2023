I've always liked drawing in Fresco, but I was hesitant to recommend it because of the monthly subscription price. But I was so wrong. First the freee version is fully featured, I didn't realize that. And on the iPad it's only $10 a year.

If you want to learn about all of Fresco's cool features, I recommend @chris-piascik channel. He's got some great tutorials over there that really helped me understand how animation works in the app.
