I've been maintaining a </span>

<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fQq7pTtNVMYVRgOPbjNz2jnyw4RABGrQoplrSQntbn8/edit">spreadsheet</a>
of contra dance events 

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/dance-weekend-and-festival-survey">for
a while</a>.  With the end of 

<a href="http://www.thedancegypsy.com/aboutDG.php">the Dance Gypsy</a>,
and 

<a href="http://www.contradancelinks.com/">ContraDanceLinks</a>
going stale, however, people asked if I could convert this into
something more usable.  So! Here's 

<a href="https://trycontra.com/events">trycontra.com/events</a>:



<p>

</p>

<p>

Initially it shows you all the events that it knows about.  These are
dance weekends, camps, festivals, etc which have a bunch of contra
dancing.  You can limit to just one state if you want:

</p>

<p>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/trycontra-events-limit-ca-big.png"><img class="mobile-fullwidth" height="429" src="https://www.jefftk.com/trycontra-events-limit-ca.png" width="550" /><div class="image-vertical-spacer"></div></a>

</p>

<p>

If you click the "map" tab at the top you can see where these events
are:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>

Clicking on a marker on the map shows you more about it:

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/trycontra-events-map-view-infobox-big.png"><img class="mobile-fullwidth" height="451" src="https://www.jefftk.com/trycontra-events-map-view-infobox.png" width="550" /><div class="image-vertical-spacer"></div></a>

</p>

<p>

If your screen is wide enough it shows both views at the same time:

</p>

<p>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/trycontra-events-both-view-big.png"><img class="mobile-fullwidth" height="338" src="https://www.jefftk.com/trycontra-events-both-view.png" width="550" /><div class="image-vertical-spacer"></div></a>

</p>

<p>

One thing that makes this tricky is that events are usually annual,
but for a while after an event it's not clear when the next one will
be or even if it will happen.  I handle these by guessing that there
will be another one next year, same month, and showing an empty entry
with a question mark:

</p>

<p>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/trycontra-events-inferred-big.png"><img class="mobile-fullwidth" height="418" src="https://www.jefftk.com/trycontra-events-inferred.png" width="550" /><div class="image-vertical-spacer"></div></a>

</p>

<p>

Note that this doesn't replace the main <a href="https://trycontra.com">trycontra.com</a> functionality of
listing local dance series.  It also has a pretty different audience,
and so different design goals: the main site is aimed at people who
don't dance (yet!) and is very simple, while this is for people who
already contra dance and would like to go to more events.

</p>

<p>

Right now this only shows the data that I was already collecting in
the spreadsheet: name, date, url, location, contra bands, contra
callers.  Several people have asked for additional data for filtering,
including:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<ul>
<li>Covid requirements (especially masking)
</li>
<li>Event length (day, weekend, week)
</li>
<li>Role terms
</li>
<li>Family events
</li>
<li>Which non-contra dances or performers are included
</li>
</ul>



<p>

While I'd be happy to tweak the UI to add them, each bit of
information requires collection and maintenance. If someone else
wanted to volunteer to take on some amount of collection, however, I
could give them edit access to the sheet and they could go do that?

</p>

<p>

Let me know if you run into any bugs, inaccuracies, or other frustrations!
