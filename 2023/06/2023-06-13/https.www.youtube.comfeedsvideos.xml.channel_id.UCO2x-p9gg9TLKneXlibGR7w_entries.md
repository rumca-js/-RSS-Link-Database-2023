Robotic vacuums have been iterating rapidly on one another and the new DEEBOT T20 OMNI from ECOVACS is probably one of the best. With a new hot-water mop washing system and a hot air dryer, you can go days or weeks without even thinking about the base station and thanks to excellent navigation and mapping capabilities, it'll get stuck less often than any other vacuum on the market (hasn't gotten stuck even once for me)!
