## Bazball unpacked: how England have turned up the dial in Test cricket

<p>Andrew Samson takes a statistical deep dive into England’s seismic change in approach and explains how the data supports it</p><p>If one match captures it, it was England’s 74-run win in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/05/anderson-and-robinson-bowl-england-to-stunning-first-test-win-over-pakistan" title="">Rawalpindi against Pakistan last December</a>. With hindsight, we can imagine exactly how England planned to go about this game, something along the lines of: “This pitch is flat, and we will need to bowl at least 250 overs to have a chance of getting Pakistan out twice. Given that it is winter, and will be getting dark early, there will probably be around 400 overs in the match. So that means we can’t bat for more than 150 overs across our two innings. If Pakistan score at their usual 3.5 runs an over across their two innings, they will get about 875. Which means we need 900 ourselves, and we need them in 150 overs.” The result? England scored <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/england-in-pakistan-2022-23-1330866/pakistan-vs-england-1st-test-1330871/full-scorecard" title="">921 runs in 136.5 overs</a> (a run-rate of 6.73) and bowled Pakistan out for 579 and 268 in a total of 252 overs, to win with around 20 minutes of light remaining. Bazball buys the bowlers time and never more so than in ’Pindi, a ground where <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/08/australian-bowlers-toil-with-ball-as-pakistan-test-peters-out-into-draw" title="">Australia’s visit nine months earlier</a> returned just 24 wickets and three innings in a soporific draw.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/13/bazball-unpacked-england-test-cricket-analysis-ashes">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Rico Verhoeven’s Dutch-produced acting debut is a slapdash meeting of illogical storylines amid meaningless plot points</p><p>This hapless Dutch-produced thriller almost redeems itself with a decent final sequence staged in the neon-doused John Wick style, but it is too little, too late. Gigantic 6ft 5in kickboxer Rico Verhoeven blows his shot at action stardom with a showing of anti-charisma best described as if Lenny from Of Mice and Men had become a special forces operative. And the Amsterdam tourist board – for whom this at least lustrously shot film serves as a long commercial – must hold serious dirt on Frank Grillo for him to have signed up. Even by his snap-your-hand-off-for-a-paycheck standards, he has a binfire on his hands.</p><p>Verhoeven plays Matteo, former crack point man for a tactical unit of vague remit, who is licking his wounds after a hostage rescue at the German national opera goes south and his boss is killed. Recuperating at a Romanian sawmill, as you do, he returns to Amsterdam to make contact with bereaved wife Helene (Marie Dompnier) as well has his goddaughter (Pippi Casey). But the former’s new husband Paul (Peter Franzén) is siphoning money from Saban (Grillo), a “Eurotrash Tony Montana” who runs the local branch of a global crime syndicate. Which puts the family in the line of fire, and forces Matteo to dust off his particular set of skills.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/13/black-lotus-review-kickboxer-thriller-looks-like-ad-for-amsterdam-tourist-board">Continue reading...</a>

## The best recent crime and thriller writing – review roundup

<p>An Indian village seeks mob justice after a girl’s death, the great Inspector Banks bows out, and clerical investigations resume for Richard Coles</p><p>Regular readers of this column will know I am a sucker for a “small community rocked by a horrible crime” story, particularly if it takes place in a setting unfamiliar to me. (See <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/sep/17/the-dry-completely-changed-my-life-jane-harper-australias-queen-of">Jane Harper</a>, who does this for Australia.) Now I’ve a new writer to shout about: Nilanjana Roy’s <strong><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/black-river-9781782279433">Black River</a></strong> (Pushkin Vertigo) takes place in the small village of Teetarpur, just outside Delhi. “There is nothing Teetarpur is famous for,” writes Roy. “The village lies at the edge of the Delhi-Haryana border, an hour’s drive down silent, forested roads covered in powdered summer dust. Its soul has remained half a century behind the capital.” Munia is a shy, sweet eight-year-old, “a brown scrap, so easily overlooked”. But she is the apple of her single father Chand’s eye. Almost as soon as the book starts, we see her murdered – hanged from a jamun tree – and then watch the village turn into a mob as her corpse is discovered, with suspicion falling upon a homeless man who was with her body. Sub-inspector Ombir Singh investigates, tries to prevent mob justice and, with his limited resources, digs to the core of a crime with long tendrils and dark origins. Roy brings rural India and Delhi to vivid life as much as she does her characters. The death of Munia is shocking and devastating: it is the mystery that drives this thriller but also its heart, as Roy tells of Chand’s prior life, and his love for his daughter. Riveting.</p><p>It is bittersweet to crack open the 28th, and final, Inspector Banks novel. The mighty <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/oct/14/peter-robinson-obituary">Peter Robinson</a>, who died last year, created one of the most convivial, compelling detectives in Alan Banks: compassionate, intelligent and music-loving, he was the sort of man you wanted to spend time with. <strong><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/standing-in-the-shadows-9781529343168">Standing in the Shadows</a></strong> (Hodder &amp; Stoughton) is a worthy addition to the Banks canon. It opens in 1980, in a Leeds living under the shadow of the Yorkshire Ripper, where student Nick discovers that his ex-girlfriend has been murdered, and that he is the prime suspect. We then move to 2019, when a skeleton that is most definitely not Roman is discovered on an archaeological dig near Scotch Corner in North Yorkshire, and Banks and his team are called in. Robinson handles his two plots with characteristic skill: the voice of student Nick is brought to enjoyably irritating life; and it is a pleasure to be back in Banks’s company, whether it’s watching him with his friends and colleagues, listening to his thoughts on music or waiting for his intuition to kick in and for him to see to the heart of things. Robinson was an author at the top of his game, and Banks a detective at the top of his. Both will be sorely missed by their readers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/13/the-best-recent-and-thriller-writing-review-roundup-black-river-nilanjana-roy-standing-in-shadows-peter-robinson-a-death-in-parish-richard-coles">Continue reading...</a>
