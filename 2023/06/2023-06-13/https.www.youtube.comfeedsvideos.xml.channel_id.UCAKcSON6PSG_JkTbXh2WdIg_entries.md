The Nude Party’s latest album, 'Rides On,' released on March 10 of this year. It’s the band’s third album, and the band have been busily touring in support of the album; in fact, they’ll be touring in Europe for most of June.

On April 16, The Nude Party played a show at the Turf Club in St. Paul, and the next day, they visited The Current studio to play four songs from the album. Watch their performance of the song "Hard Times (All Around)" above.
