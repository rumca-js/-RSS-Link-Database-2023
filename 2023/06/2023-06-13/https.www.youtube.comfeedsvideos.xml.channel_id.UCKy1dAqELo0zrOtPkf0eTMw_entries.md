Savage Gauntlet is a brand-new player versus environment (PvE) game mode coming to Exoprimal. In this new co-op game mode, five-player teams take on PvE scenarios that rotate weekly. These limited-time missions are late-game content that offers a higher level of challenge. Exofighters are encouraged to take leveled-up Exosuits into these combat tests and equip Module power-ups. Savage Gauntlet presents squads across the world with the same objective and the Exoprimal community is invited to vie for the fastest completion time. The missions are replayable and groups are welcome to come back and try new strategies to achieve higher rankings and even earn rewards.

Exoprimal is an online, team-based action game pitting humanity’s futuristic Exosuit technology against history’s most ferocious beasts – dinosaurs. Set in 2040, players are pulled into wargames orchestrated by the advanced A.I. Leviathan. In the main game mode Dino Survival, teams of five Exofighters race to complete objectives while fending off hordes of dinosaurs to survive. Each match is different from the last, and players can swap between Exosuits at any time and change their tactics as new challenges arise. Along the way, players will unlock story sequences and earn rewards to customize their Exosuits. 

Exoprimal releases worldwide on July 14 for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Windows, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PC via Steam.

Check out the teaser trailer for Disney and Pixar's Elio, an upcoming movie starring America Ferrera, Yonas Kibreab, Jameela Jamil, and Brad Garrett.

For centuries, people have called out to the universe looking for answers—in Disney and Pixar’s all-new movie “Elio,” the universe calls back! The original feature film introduces Elio, an underdog with an active imagination who finds himself inadvertently beamed up to the Communiverse, an interplanetary organization with representatives from galaxies far and wide. Mistakenly identified as Earth’s ambassador to the rest of the universe, and completely unprepared for that kind of pressure, Elio must form new bonds with eccentric alien lifeforms, survive a series of formidable trials and somehow discover who he is truly meant to be. 

Directed by Adrian Molina (screenwriter and co-director of “Coco”) and produced by Mary Alice Drumm (associate producer of “Coco”), the film features the voices of America Ferrera as Elio’s mom, Olga; Jameela Jamil as Ambassador Questa; Brad Garrett as Ambassador Grigon; and Yonas Kibreab as the title character. 

Elio releases in theaters on March 1, 2024.

From filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos and producer Emma Stone comes the incredible tale and fantastical evolution of Bella Baxter (Stone), a young woman brought back to life by the brilliant and unorthodox scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe). Under Baxter’s protection, Bella is eager to learn. Hungry for the worldliness she is lacking, Bella runs off with Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), a slick and debauched lawyer, on a whirlwind adventure across the continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella grows steadfast in her purpose to stand for equality and liberation.

Poor Things opens in theaters on September 8, 2023.
