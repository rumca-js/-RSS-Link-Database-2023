This was the 1990s, when we were all very concerned about CFCs and other greenhouse gases, although not enough to lose sleep over them. I remember carefully spelling out CHLOROFLUOROCARBONS in bubble letters on poster paper for a school project. I had a thing for dolphins and wanted to be a marine biologist. Clean Up Australia Day was still in its infancy. <br /><br />Our world was smaller then, information thinner on the ground. Dial-up internet was years away from being a fixture in most homes and we collected cardboard circles from chip packets for fun. It\u2019s easy to wearily suggest kids today have it better. But we didn\u2019t feel that we had to carry the weight of the world on our shoulders. We watched Captain Planet, recycled, sometimes picked up extra rubbish if we were being punished or feeling virtuous, but we mostly trusted adults had things in hand. There was never any suggestion it might be too late to turn the ship around.</p><p>That\u2019s a luxury today\u2019s kids don\u2019t have. They navigate an increasingly complex world, with more awareness than ever before about what is going wrong \u2013 and it\u2019s taking a toll. A <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(21)00278-3/fulltext\">survey of 10,000 young people</a> in 2021 found 84% were at least moderately worried about climate change, 59% were extremely worried and 45% said it negatively affected their daily life and functioning. The low hum of climate anxiety is building to a roar and it\u2019s having a profound effect on kids\u2019 mental health.<br /><br />In the summer of 2019-2020, as bushfires raged across Australia, driving species to the brink of extinction and turning air hazardous, it seemed something had finally shifted. This was our wake-up call. The world was taking notice and I was sure things would be different after this. We would recover and mobilise in a unified way. Then came Covid. The air was safe to breathe again, but only if no one else was standing nearby. Disposable masks littered the streets and KeepCups were banned. Along with the rest of the world, I fell into a deep funk. I watched a lot of TV.<br /><br />One night the screen transported me to a magical place, an icy island halfway between Norway and the north pole, home to reindeer, polar bears and northern lights. On the island was a mountain, its entrance marked by a glittering green art installation. And inside the mountain was a vault filled with millions of seeds. But this wasn\u2019t a fantasy film, it was a real place: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/03/global-seed-vault-svalbard-virtual-tour-aoe\">Global Seed Vault in Svalbard</a> \u2013 built by the Norwegian government for the good of humanity. More than one million seed samples from almost every country in the world are stored there in case of global disaster, such as war \u2013 or climate catastrophe.<br /><br />This microdose of wonder during a dark time inspired what would become my first picture book. <a href=\"https://www.uqp.com.au/books/the-garden-at-the-end-of-the-world\">The Garden at the End of the World</a> is about a girl who finds a rare plant near her home and goes on an adventure with her botanist mother to deliver it to the Global Seed Vault for safekeeping. It was the lullaby I needed to get me through lockdown \u2013 an ode to nature and wonder and the helpers; the good things already being done. I didn\u2019t realise it would resonate with so many weary kids and parents as well.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/14/its-not-the-job-of-children-to-fix-the-climate-crisis-we-must-show-them-grown-ups-are-leading-the-way\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/14/its-not-the-job-of-children-to-fix-the-climate-crisis-we-must-show-them-grown-ups-are-leading-the-way", "date_published": "2023-06-13 15:00:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Guns, girls and that moustache: Magnum PI is the perfect antidote to a bad day", "description": "<p>Running around like a day-drunk Han Solo in a dazzling Hawaiian shirt, Tom Selleck\u2019s cocky and chivalrous private investigator remains a TV great</p><ul><li><em>Magnum PI is streaming on Binge.

His sceptical comments rile female classmates who are quick to accuse him of \u201cviolence\u201d.<br /></p><p>There\u2019s more than a whiff in this piss-take of MFA culture of a former creative writing graduate unloading a degree\u2019s worth of beef (you suspect that a small portion of the book\u2019s audience may be reading the workshop scenes very attentively indeed). But the literary send-up is just a springboard for a broader exploration of education, economics and desire. When class is brought prematurely to an end and Seamus picks up an extra shift at the hospice kitchen where he funds his study, Taylor introduces the book\u2019s central tension, between students who have money and those who don\u2019t, as micro-dramas continually break out among its highly strung cast over, say, the morality of selling sex clips online or working in an abattoir as they pursue ambitions in music, dance and writing.<br /><br /><em>Real Life</em> drew power from putting us in the headspace of a single character at odds with his milieu. Nothing in <em>The Late Americans</em> matches the dramatic interest of that book; the basic but unignorable problem is that the characters are simply too inert. Dialogue boils down to passive-aggressive squabbles that circle unvoiced emotion, a tension-generating strategy dulled through overuse. It hardly helps that the novel itself keeps insisting how irrelevant everything is. What starts as the despondency of particular characters (\u201cHe mattered so little\u201d; \u201cThey were all inconsequential\u201d) spirals into a kind of blanket auto-cancellation: \u201cthe whole world, the whole procession of its events marched on without a single notice or care that there in their tiny, obscure particle of the galaxy, two people\u2019s hearts were breaking over and over again\u201d.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/13/the-late-americans-by-brandon-taylor-review-a-real-university-challenge\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/13/the-late-americans-by-brandon-taylor-review-a-real-university-challenge", "date_published": "2023-06-13 06:00:42+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "A three-week repair to my cherished Mini has taken eight months", "description": "<p>I miss it, and wanted it checked over to take part in a charity drive</p><p><strong>I am a pensioner and last September had my cherished low-mileage classic Mini transported to a garage in Northampton for repairs on its automatic gearbox.</strong></p><p><strong>I wanted the car checked over because I intended to take part in a 1,000-mile charity drive to raise money for multiple sclerosis.
