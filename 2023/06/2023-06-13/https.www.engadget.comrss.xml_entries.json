The company is continuing the fun with a built-in minigame when you search for &quot;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=katamari\"><ins>Katamari</ins></a><ins>&quot;</ins> (via <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/google-katamari-damacy-search-minigame-widget-1850534121\"><em><ins>Kotaku</ins></em></a>), a game series that originally launched on the PlayStation 2. The minigame lets you roll everything on the page into a virtual ball. To start, you click on the Katamari ball icon on the right side of your screen. You play the game by using your keyboard\u2019s arrow keys if on a desktop or laptop or with your finger if on a mobile device.</p><p>The easter egg is likely referencing the <a href=\"https://www.bandainamcoent.asia/sea/news/we-love-katamari-reroll-royal-reverie-release-date\"><ins>recent remaster</ins></a> of <em>We Love Katamari </em>earlier this month. The game, which was originally released on PlayStation 2 in 2005, got a remaster titled: <em>We Love Katamari Reroll+ Royal Reverie</em>. The title was made available on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and on Steam.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The Katamari series is developed by Bandai Namco and revolves around a series of puzzle-action games where you play as the Prince of All Cosmos. In the surreal series, you\u2019re tasked with rolling up a ball of random things such as cats, cars and more \u2013 those balls replace the stars in the sky that were destroyed by your father, The King of the Cosmos.</p><p>Thankfully, Google\u2019s version is a little less stress-inducing. There\u2019s no goal or time limit per-se, you just roll a Katamari ball till your heart\u2019s content (or if you have nothing left to catch). I spent more time than I\u2019m willing to admit &quot;testing&quot; the game on my computer and it runs pretty well in my experience. Mobile, on the other hand, is a bit rough. The game seems to have a decent amount of input lag which makes the experience less than desirable. But as a little easter egg, Katamari fans should still get a laugh out of this.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/googles-katamari-damacy-easter-egg-lets-you-roll-up-your-search-results-220033724.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/googles-katamari-damacy-easter-egg-lets-you-roll-up-your-search-results-220033724.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-13 22:00:33+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Fast-paced platformer 'Neon White' is coming to Xbox", "description": "<p>During the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/watch-the-xbox-games-showcase-extended-here-at-1pm-et-160311431.html\">Xbox Games Extended Showcase</a>, it <a href=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/06/13/idxbox-reveals-10-games-coming-to-game-pass/\">emerged</a> that several more indie titles are bound for Game Pass.

At a session following this week\u2019s Xbox Showcase at Summer Game Fest, five fellow spirits and I tried to escape hell.&nbsp;</p><p>In this early build of the game, there were two character types in play: a swordsman who could deal heavy close-range damage and an archer who could send up to three arrows toward enemies before having to reload. I got to play as the latter. Alongside the standard attacks, I could hold the action button to charge up a heavier piercing shot. The archer, when he reloads, recalls his fired arrows back to him, meaning strategic placement can effectively double the damage dealt.</p><div id=\"266bbb172f4144bf90138b751d61737f\"></div><p>All the characters also have a dash move, while trigger buttons open your world map, emote wheel and co-op powers. These co-op powers will vary depending on your character type and often demand careful planning to pull them off. Pressing the RB trigger displays a trio of circles on the ground; two of your fellow immortals need to activate the empty circles in order to trigger the attack. For me, this rained arrows on a wide area of the map, but for the swordsman, it launched a wide-ranged healing spell.</p><figure><img alt=\"33 Immortals&#xa7;\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/d8064021-0986-11ee-bd8b-04a294cfb8f5\" style=\"height: 1080px; width: 1920px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Thunder Lotus</div></figure><p>With plenty of enemies on-screen, especially in the more challenging portal dungeons, it\u2019s a lot of fun just chaotically spamming attacks, helping the rest of your team finish off mid-bosses, or picking off easier foes at a distance before they coordinate their attacks.</p><p>If the sword and bow options sound a little limiting, don\u2019t worry: <em>33 Immortals</em> will offer up plenty of different character types to play with. With seven deadly sins and seven heavenly virtues, we\u2019ll likely get to play around with seven different warriors. Outside of co-op powers and quirks, the button layouts don\u2019t change among characters, making it easier to try out every option. To add a little more complexity, you can gather up in-game currency from monsters you kill, exchanging them for healing or trinkets to boost attack speed, defense and more.</p><p>And you\u2019ll likely have to try, try and try again. Each raid is built to be around 25 minutes long, and you'll want to keep as many players alive (and online) as possible so you'll be able to fell the boss at the end. More players will mean it\u2019ll take less time to shave the health bar of bigger enemies, as the game apparently isn\u2019t built to scale with how many characters are playing. More immortals is always better.</p><p>By the way, you\u2019re not quite <em>immortal</em> as a fighter, either. After taking too much damage, you\u2019ll fall and reappear as an ethereal spirit, not able to do anything but float around until another raider can resurrect you \u2013 something that proved to be particularly frustrating in the middle of difficult fights. Naturally, it\u2019s just better if you fight more cautiously, heal your allies and\u2026 don\u2019t die.</p><p><em>33 Immortals</em> is inspired by Dante's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_Comedy\"><em>Divine Comedy</em></a><em>.</em> You're rebelling against God\u2019s final judgment that your soul is damned, and there's a fun twist in the way God delivers his anger when you beat one of his dungeons. As you step out of the portal, the ground around you will get immolated in holy fire, and you\u2019ll have to dodge this and spawning enemies until God chills a little.</p><p>While this was an early demo, latency was a struggle for my machine, but the team has plenty of time to stabilize \u2013 and offer demos that are not in the middle of a hectic Xbox showcase.

At Summer Game Fest, the game\u2019s creative director Chris Esaki talked a group of journalists through this new career-mode loop and the shift in philosophy for the series.</p><p>Esaki described <em>Forza Horizon </em>as \u201ca whole new take on falling in love with cars.\u201d We saw a career mode event called the Builders Cup, which began with a narrated showcase of a trio of cars. After picking one to roll with, you then head into \u201copen practice,\u201d where you get to know the car. These sessions are packed full of stats and challenges; you earn Car Experience Points (CXP) for every corner you take, and the closer to perfection you are the more CXP you\u2019ll get. CXP is specific to each car, and is used to upgrade parts and customize vehicle performance.</p><p>After open practice, you head into a race, where there\u2019s a new \u201cchallenge the grid\u201d system that lets you essentially bet against your racing talent. You choose where on the grid to start and how fast your AI opponents are, with higher rewards as the difficulty scales up.

The news comes in the wake of the company <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/embracer-group-loses-undisclosed-2-billion-deal-amid-challenging-year/1100-6514494/\">revealing</a> that a deal that would have been worth $2 billion in revenue over six years fell apart, despite Embracer having a verbal agreement from its unnamed proposed partner.</p><p>It will take until March next year to complete the restructuring process. It's &quot;too early to give an exact forecast&quot; on how many of Embracer's nearly 17,000 workers will be impacted, CEO Lars Wingefors <a href=\"https://embracer.com/releases/open-letter-by-embracer-group-ceo-on-restructuring-program/\">wrote in an open letter</a>.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>&quot;The actions will include, but not be limited to, closing or divestments of some studios and the termination or pausing of some ongoing game development projects,&quot; Wingefors wrote. &quot;It will also include decreased spending on non-development costs such as overhead and other operating expenses. We will reduce third party publishing and put greater focus on internal [intellectual property] and increase external funding of large-budget games.&quot;</p><p>It is not yet clear which studios the company plans to close or sell. Embracer says the game cancellations are &quot;almost entirely&quot; for projects that haven't been announced and for which it projects low returns. &quot;All announced significant releases will still be released as planned,&quot; Wingefors said. For instance, Crystal Dynamics, which is <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazon-games-tomb-raider-crystal-dynamics-173848481.html\">working on a new Tomb Raider game</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/perfect-dark-initiative-xbox-announcement-005705713.html\">helping The Initiative with <em>Perfect Dark</em></a>, says those projects won't be impacted by the changes.</p><p>Over the last several years, Embracer has vacuumed up a wide array of notable gaming companies and intellectual property rights. It <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/embracer-group-gearbox-merger-aspyr-acquisition-154253122.html\">bought Gearbox for $1.3 billion</a> in 2021.

Wingefors noted there will also be more accountability across the company to make sure &quot;performance is in line with or exceeding current targets.&quot;</p><p>Wingefors ended the letter by noting some of the decisions Embracer makes as part of the restructuring will be &quot;difficult&quot; ones. However, he wrote, &quot;we are doing this because we are confident that we will emerge a stronger, more efficient company setting out on a stable future to build even greater value across our many studios and fantastic portfolio of IPs.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/embracer-announces-layoffs-and-game-cancellations-after-a-2-billion-deal-falls-through-144311854.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/embracer-announces-layoffs-and-game-cancellations-after-a-2-billion-deal-falls-through-144311854.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-13 14:43:11+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Watch the trailer for the second season of Apple TV+ series 'Foundation'", "description": "<p>Following a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-plus-foundation-season-two-teaser-release-window-181532332.html\">sneak peek</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/foundation-will-return-to-apple-tv-on-july-14th-140038865.html\">teaser</a>, Apple TV+ has finally released the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=89f68c82-f255-44fa-8db9-03fec996b93a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YouTube&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4OWY2OGM4Mi1mMjU1LTQ0ZmEtOGRiOS0wM2ZlYzk5NmI5M2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj0ydDBCR2tWUU11USIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNDYyNzcxZjgtYzMwNS00Yjk4LTlhNjYtMjA2NWQ0MmFhMDkzIn0&amp;signature=AQAAASNlDN_ZTrVrZP0Cx1IZiOwTukzSMMhkjLdCqzPgmYz0&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D2t0BGkVQMuQ\">official trailer for season two of Foundation</a> \u2014 set 100 years ahead of season one's finale.

Paul McCartney has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/13/ai-used-to-create-new-and-final-beatles-song-says-paul-mccartney\">revealed</a> to BBC Radio 4 that he's using AI to turn a John Lennon demo into one last song for The Beatles. The technology helped extract Lennon's voice to get a &quot;pure&quot; version that could be mixed into a finished composition. The piece will be released later this year, McCartney says.</p><p>McCartney didn't name the song, but it's believed to be &quot;Now and Then,&quot; a 1978 love song Lennon put on cassettes meant for the other former Beatle. <em>The Guardian</em> notes the tune was considered for release as a reunion song alongside tracks that did make the cut, such as &quot;Free As A Bird,&quot; but there wasn't much to it \u2014 just a chorus, a crude backing track and the lightest of verses. The Beatles rejected it after George Harrison thought it was bad, and the electrical buzz from Lennon's apartment didn't help matters.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The inspiration for the revival came from dialog editor Emile de la Rey's work on the Peter Jackson documentary <em>Get Back</em>, where AI separated the Beatles' voices from instruments and other sounds. The tech provides &quot;some sort of leeway&quot; for producing songs, McCartney adds.</p><p>To date, music labels typically haven't been fond of AI due to copyright clashes. Creators have used algorithms to have famous artists &quot;sing&quot; songs they never actually produced, such as a recently pulled fantasy collaboration between Drake and The Weeknd. This, however, is different \u2014 McCartney is using AI to salvage a track that otherwise wouldn't have reached the public. It won't be surprising if other artists use the technique to recover work that would otherwise sit in an archive.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/paul-mccartney-is-using-ai-to-create-a-final-song-for-the-beatles-133839244.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/paul-mccartney-is-using-ai-to-create-a-final-song-for-the-beatles-133839244.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-13 13:38:39+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Meta's Horizon Worlds is getting a text-based 'world chat' feature", "description": "<p>After introducing <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/meta-quests-give-you-more-to-do-in-its-horizon-worlds-vr-social-network-073029493.html\">mini-games</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/metas-horizon-worlds-is-opening-to-young-teens-in-the-us-and-canada-194600914.html\">allowing access</a> to younger teens, Meta is trying to make its VR-based Horizon Worlds more social. In its latest update, the company released a new feature called <a href=\"https://www.meta.com/en-gb/blog/quest/meta-horizon-worlds-v114-release-notes/\">world chat</a> that lets users send messages to anyone else in the same world session. At the same time, it's promising strict security controls for the new feature.&nbsp;</p><p>A voice chat feature is already available, but this works much like a regular text messaging app. A screen shot (below) shows a classic group texting interface, with multiple users participating.

You'll be able to @mention others in world chat, provided they're in the same world. It offers ease-of-use tools like quick replies so you can connect without the need to type long messages.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt=\"Meta's Horizon Worlds is getting a text-based 'World Chat' feature\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/274247c0-09e5-11ee-be7d-f5db9cd71926\" style=\"height: 2050px; width: 4670px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Meta</div></figure><p>Along with world chat, Facebook introduced tools to &quot;help create a positive community experience,&quot; it said. To start with, it automatically scans and deletes messages that go against its code of conduct. It allows users to blur chats so that messages from people they don't know will be blurred, and their own chats will appear blurred to others. Users can report, block or mute anyone, and minimize or hide the chat window.</p><p>The blur setting is automatically enabled for teens aged 13-17. Meta is also expanding parental supervision tools to allow users to ensure that their kids &quot;have an age-appropriate chat experience by changing or locking the blurred chat settings,&quot; it wrote.</p><p>Earlier this year, US senators <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/senators-urge-meta-not-to-open-horizon-worlds-up-to-younger-teens-161159421.html\">urged Meta</a> not to open Horizon Worlds up to younger teens, citing the company's record of failure to protect them. That concern appeared to be justified following recent report of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/meta-vows-to-take-action-after-report-found-instagrams-algorithm-promoted-pedophilia-content-133343896.html\">widespread CSAM on Instagram</a>. Meta <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2023/04/horizon-worlds-teen-expansion-us-canada/\">did it anyway</a>, though, promising to put in place age-appropriate tools and protections. &quot;We have to build experiences which are tailored to the unique vulnerabilities of teens,&quot; the company said at the time.

You can create schedules and routines, too, either through a plug\u2019s proprietary app or through your preferred smart home platform. But much like other IoT devices, which system plays nice with which plug depends on compatibility, and each brand\u2019s app offers different features. We tested out ten popular options to see which are worth buying.</p><h2>What to consider when buying a smart plug</h2><p>Before you buy one, it helps to know what a smart plug can and can\u2019t do. They work best with things that have an on/off switch, making them great for lamps and other lights. If you want a plug-in fan to move some air around before you get home, a smart plug can help. You can load a basic coffee maker with grounds and water the night before and wake up to a fresh pot in the  morning. And instead of an air purifier running all day, you could set it to just run when you\u2019re away. But any device that needs to be programmed further, or requires a stand-by mode, isn\u2019t ideal.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><h3><strong>Setup and use</strong></h3><p>Adding a smart plug to your home is relatively simple. You\u2019ll use the manufacturer\u2019s app to initially connect, after which you can add the plug to a compatible smart home ecosystem. Both the brand\u2019s app and your smart home app will let you name the plug, set schedules and program \u201croutines\u201d which control multiple smart devices at once. But as you can guess, a manufacturer\u2019s app only lets you control products from that brand. If you want to operate a plug from TP-Link\u2019s Kasa, a bulb from GE\u2019s Cync and a camera from Wyze, you\u2019ll need to use a smart home platform, which means you\u2019ll need to consider compatibility.</p><h3><strong>Compatibility</strong></h3><p>Smart home devices connect through wireless protocols, often using more than one to communicate with your phone, smart speaker, internet connection and in some cases, one another. The majority of smart plugs use WiFi, but some newer plugs use a low-power network standard called Thread. It\u2019s more secure than WiFi, tends to be more reliable and its mesh capabilities provide stronger coverage as more Thread devices are added. These devices require a Thread border router, such as an Apple HomePod or TV, a fourth-generation Amazon Echo or Google Nest Hub.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/matter-smart-home-standard-released-160059101.html\">Matter</a> is a new wireless standard intended to solve compatibility issues between different brands and manufacturers, while also improving security and reliability. Only a few such smart plugs are available right now, and they currently work via WiFi, Bluetooth and Thread networks. These devices require a controller that stays at home, like a smart speaker, if you want to manage things when you\u2019re out and about. If the device <em>also</em> uses Thread, you might need a smart speaker that acts as a border router, like the ones listed above. If all that sounds complicated, it is. Matter promises simplicity, but hasn\u2019t delivered just yet.</p><p>As for Bluetooth, most plugs, including all Matter plugs, use the short-range protocol to get the device set up for the first time. Some can continue to run on Bluetooth in the absence of another option, but the connection isn\u2019t as reliable and you won\u2019t be able to control the plug when you\u2019re away from home, or perhaps even just on the other side of the apartment.</p><p>Because Matter is relatively new, it may be easier to consider the manufacturer\u2019s system you\u2019d use the most. There are four major \u201cbranded\u201d smart home platforms: Amazon\u2019s Alexa, Google Home, Apple\u2019s HomeKit and Samsung\u2019s SmartThings. The first two work with the widest range of brands and are compatible with both iOS and Android devices. HomeKit not only limits app access to Apple devices, but it\u2019s also compatible with fewer plugs. You can also turn to open-source software like Home Assistant or go with the larger functionality of IFTTT if you want to, say, tweet to turn your lights on. For the purposes of our testing, we stuck with the four big players. Nearly every plug we looked at clearly stated which platforms it works with, both on the packaging and retail product pages.</p><p>Of course, there\u2019s no rule that says you have to stick with one home assistant. You might have an Echo Dot in the basement, a HomePod in the living room and a Google Nest Mini in the kitchen, each controlling their compatible devices. You only need to pair up the right smart home platform with the right device (and then just remember which speaker controls what).</p><figure><img alt=\"Five smart plugs from TP-Link, Amazon, Emporia and GE are stacked on a yellow, orange and brown tiled surface.  \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/abb9a9f0-fff7-11ed-8793-52cc472ff4e4\" style=\"height: 1200px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Amy Skorheim / Engadget</div></figure><h3><strong>Sharing</strong></h3><p>Once a plug is set up with your platform and voice assistant of choice, anyone can control the plug just by talking. If someone else wants to control things with their phone, things get more complicated. Google makes it easiest, allowing you to invite another person just by tapping the + button within the Home app. Whomever you invite will have full access to your connected devices \u2013 including cameras \u2013 so this is only for people you trust the most.</p><p>HomeKit makes it similarly easy to grant app access to someone else, but as with most things Apple, it only works for other iOS users. Amazon only allows you to share access to your Echo, not your connected home devices.</p><p>Many smart plug manufacturers allow you to share control through their app by inviting another person via email. But this only grants access to devices of that brand. Hopefully as Matter expands, multi-admin features will become more widespread.</p><h2>How we tested</h2><p>Before we decided which smart plugs to test, we considered brands Engadget staffers have had the best experiences with, both in review capacity and personally. We also checked out other online reviews. We then looked at factors like price, compatibility and relative popularity. I got ahold of ten smart plugs from eight manufacturers and set up each one using its proprietary app, then added it to all compatible smart home platforms. Plugging in a cadre of lamps, I tested the plugs using an iPhone 11, Galaxy S10e, Echo Dot, HomePod mini and Nest Mini. I accessed the plugs via the apps and through voice commands and controlled them in my home and away from it. I programmed schedules and routines and moved the plugs to different outlets, including ones in the basement to gauge range.</p><p>Here\u2019s every smart plug tested before settling on our top picks:</p><ul><li><p><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\"

Energy</a> (Matter)</p></li></ul><h2>The best smart plugs</h2><h2>Best overall: TP-Link Kasa EP25</h2><p></p><p>All of the plugs eventually did what they said they would, but each had a quirk or two that gave me pause \u2013 except TP-Link\u2019s <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9LYXNhLVNtYXJ0LVN1cHBvcnRlZC1TY2hlZHVsaW5nLUVQMjVQNC9kcC9CMEIxNEM3MTlULz90aD0xJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTEybi0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOGNmYWNlYjgtOGJmNS00NjJjLWIyMDEtYzFiMTRmNDI2YTcwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAATVeQ0mnebS3GSYDCv1BCql5J1rTNbfKpjELFIikAgF4&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FKasa-Smart-Supported-Scheduling-EP25P4%2Fdp%2FB0B14C719T%2F%3Fth%3D1\">Kasa EP25</a>. From installation to implementation, it was fuss-free and reliable. It\u2019s also one of the cheaper plugs on our list at just $13 each (but you\u2019ll usually find it in a four-pack). It works well with both iOS and Android and on all four smart home platforms. The Kasa app has a clean, intuitive design and includes the features you\u2019d expect like timers, schedules, a vacation mode and smart actions (aka scenes). TP-Link makes a wide range of other smart devices, so you could expand your smart home without having to leave the Kasa app.</p><p>The EP25 is an updated version of the HS103 that adds HomeKit compatibility, so I was able to control it with both an iPhone and an Android phone. If you also live in a blended OS home, I recommend onboarding with the iPhone first. After tapping the + button in the Kasa iOS app, a HomeKit pop-up will prompt you to add the plug using the QR code from the box. (The code\u2019s also printed on the plug, but that\u2019s harder to access.)</p><p>Once set up in HomeKit, it was easy to add the plug to the other smart home apps. Google Home and SmartThings just need your TP-Link log-in details and Alexa uses the Kasa \u201cskill.\u201d Once you\u2019ve added one plug, any future TP-Link devices you incorporate should automatically show up in each app. If you\u2019re only using an Android device, the Kasa app will walk you through using a temporary Wi-Fi network to get the plug online.</p><p>After setup, I named the plug and assigned it a room (making sure it was the same in each app to avoid confusing myself). Then I programmed various routines and schedules and asked all three voice assistants to turn the light on and off \u2013 everything worked without a hitch. In the weeks of testing, the EP25 never had a connection hiccup, even after I relocated it to the basement, which is the farthest point from my router.</p><p>My single complaint is that sharing with another user isn\u2019t supported within the Kasa app. You <em>can</em> share your log-in details with the other person, as the app <em>does</em> support access from multiple devices on one account. But Google Home feels like the best way to <a href=\"https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/9155535?hl=en\">share smart home device control</a>, whether that\u2019s between iOS and Android devices or when everyone uses the same OS.</p><h2>Best for homes with Alexa: Amazon Smart Plug</h2><p></p><p>If you have many Echo devices and use Alexa to answer your questions, control your music and manage your timers, <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BbWF6b24tc21hcnQtcGx1Zy13b3Jrcy13aXRoLUFsZXhhL2RwL0IwODlEUjI5VDY_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMTJuLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4Y2ZhY2ViOC04YmY1LTQ2MmMtYjIwMS1jMWIxNGY0MjZhNzAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdObz7PFS_aWFSzMamJNiho7da8RvC2BwFwpaLPacz5p&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAmazon-smart-plug-works-with-Alexa%2Fdp%2FB089DR29T6\">Amazon\u2019s smart plug</a> makes the most sense. Your Echos and Alexa app already have your details, so you won\u2019t have to create an account, enter your WiFi password or switch to a different app, which makes setup mindlessly simple. In addition to naming your plug, you\u2019ll also want to designate it as a light under Type in the settings menu. That way, when you say, \u201cAlexa, turn all the lights off,\u201d it will act accordingly.</p><p>I was impressed with the speed of the onboarding process and how seamlessly the plug blended into the Alexa ecosystem, giving it another IRL appendage to flex. I still get a small thrill when I say, \u201cAlexa, goodnight,\u201d and all goes dark. However, you won\u2019t be able to use the plug with any other smart home app, which is why it\u2019s best for those who\u2019ve already gone all-in on an Amazon home.</p><p>The only other drawback, and it\u2019s not a small one, is the Alexa app\u2019s lack of sharing capabilities. You can create households that let other people in your home access your Echo speakers through their phone, but they can\u2019t see your smart home devices. If you\u2019re the only one who needs app access and everyone else in your home is happy to interact via voice commands only, this plug couldn\u2019t be simpler. At $25, it\u2019s not the cheapest smart plug, but like all things Amazon, it goes on sale fairly often.</p><h2>Best Matter Plug: TP-Link Kasa KP125M</h2><p></p><p>Only a handful of Matter-enabled smart plugs are currently available and the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9LYXNhLVNtYXJ0LU1vbml0b3JpbmctQ29tcGFjdC1DZXJ0aWZpZWQvZHAvQjBCWUdSTFJTMT90aD0xJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTEybi0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOGNmYWNlYjgtOGJmNS00NjJjLWIyMDEtYzFiMTRmNDI2YTcwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAVoQglU4Ud6_JSSmVKjiWwLowwXacVXmZvrACeftIX8J&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FKasa-Smart-Monitoring-Compact-Certified%2Fdp%2FB0BYGRLRS1%3Fth%3D1\">Kasa KP125M</a> is the best of what we tried. It works with all four platforms, installs easily and reliably maintains connections. Most Matter devices need to be initialized with a QR code, but this plug also supports Bluetooth onboarding, which saves a step. I set it up through the Kasa app first and because I already had another Kasa plug installed, the process was simplified, automatically prompting me to add the plug with a couple of taps. Adding the device to Alexa, Google Home and Samsung\u2019s SmartThings worked the same way, with each app letting me know I had new devices available to add.</p><p>To add the plug to HomeKit, I had to scan the included barcode. The process didn\u2019t work at first and I ended up having to long-press the button on the side to make it enter pairing mode. Unlike some Matter plugs, KP125M doesn\u2019t require a Thread border router. And because it\u2019s also a WiFi plug, you don\u2019t need a Matter controller, such as a smart speaker for access when you\u2019re away from home. That said, many of the negative reviews on Amazon have to do with the plug\u2019s poor HomeKit compatibility. In addition to the setup hitch I mentioned, the connection with the HomeKit app and Siri was extremely spotty until I added Apple\u2019s HomePod mini to the mix as a dedicated hub. After that, the reliability improved.</p><p>It\u2019s important to note that our best overall pick is $7 cheaper and also works with all four platforms. The higher price tag is likely due to the Matter logo on the side. The protocol is still very new, and honestly, I\u2019d call the KP125M plug more of a hybrid WiFi-Bluetooth-Matter plug, which could be why it played nice with every platform. The other Matter plug, the <a href=\"https://www.evehome.com/en-us/eve-energy\">Eve Energy Matter plug</a>, requires you to have a HomePod for HomeKit access, a Nest Hub for Google Home connection and a SmartThings hub to make it work with Samsung\u2019s system. The promise of Matter is faster and simpler connectivity \u2013 requiring three hubs to work with various platforms seems to miss that point.</p><h2>Honorable mentions</h2><h2></h2><h3><strong>GE Cync Indoor</strong></h3><p></p><p>My main concern with the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9HRS1MaWdodGluZy1CdWlsdC1CbHVldG9vdGgtQ29tcGF0aWJsZS9kcC9CMDk0OEw3WjVXP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTEybi0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOGNmYWNlYjgtOGJmNS00NjJjLWIyMDEtYzFiMTRmNDI2YTcwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAVVzU_llYXivlFDnFSFWfYu8MVRVUVkgevIKag-6UxzA&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGE-Lighting-Built-Bluetooth-Compatible%2Fdp%2FB0948L7Z5W\">Cync plug</a> is the way the scheduling works within the proprietary app. Instead of programming when an outlet should turn <em>on</em>, you tell it when it should turn <em>off</em>. Despite my best efforts, I could not figure out how to program the Cync-connected lamp to come on at sunset, as I did with every other plug. Other than that, the app is very elegant, set up is easy and reliability is spot on. It only works with Alexa and Google Home, not HomeKit or SmartThings, but at $15, it\u2019s a couple bucks cheaper than the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=a63bc308-e20c-4e77-bcbd-6eb6848d2a64&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Wyze+Labs&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJhNjNiYzMwOC1lMjBjLTRlNzctYmNiZC02ZWI2ODQ4ZDJhNjQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3l6ZS5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvd3l6ZS1wbHVnIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4Y2ZhY2ViOC04YmY1LTQ2MmMtYjIwMS1jMWIxNGY0MjZhNzAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAV5nLz5lUL3AHw38xi7HIL_qpDcXv0cO4YKbViZwHibk&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wyze.com%2Fproducts%2Fwyze-plug\">Wyze plug</a> that has the same compatibility.</p><h3><strong>Emporia Smart Outlet</strong></h3><p></p><p>At just $12 each (sold in a four-pack), <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9FbXBvcmlhLUVuZXJneS1Nb25pdG9yLUNlcnRpZmllZC1QYWNrYWdlL2RwL0IwOENWU1NWV1AvP3RoPTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMTJuLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4Y2ZhY2ViOC04YmY1LTQ2MmMtYjIwMS1jMWIxNGY0MjZhNzAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAaNA-wLq6PAEh57D53tpn3P1keDZEybBNDky-S-tvrxp&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FEmporia-Energy-Monitor-Certified-Package%2Fdp%2FB08CVSSVWP%2F%3Fth%3D1\">Emporia Smart Outlets</a> are a good choice for those who want to keep an exacting eye on their home\u2019s energy use. Emporia also makes whole-home batteries and energy monitors, and their focus is more technical than slick. The plug/* wouldn't connect until the third try, but after that, it worked well with both Alexa and Google Home apps.

The company will hold a Nothing Phone 2 launch event on July 11th at 11AM Eastern, with a livestream available through the <a href=\"https://www.nothing.tech/\">official website</a>. The preview image doesn't show much, although we'd note that the signature Glyph lights aren't quite the same as on <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nothing-phone-1-review-transparent-smartphone-090029611.html\">the Phone 1</a>.</p><p>The Phone 2 may be more important than its predecessor for one main reason: it's the first Nothing handset coming to the US. Until now, you've had to either participate in a limited beta program or take a chance on an import. If you've made that leap, you've dealt with gaps in network coverage (such as missing 5G) and no real technical support. An official US release should improve wireless support and reach a wider audience, especially if carriers sell the phone themselves.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Nothing founder Carl Pei has described the Phone 2 as a more premium device than last year's model, which shipped with a Snapdragon 778G+ chip and other mostly mid-range specs. The company has already <a href=\"https://twitter.com/getpeid/status/1659130482242486272?s=20\">confirmed</a> it will use the slightly old (but noticeably faster) Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1. That will also deliver improved camera performance, such as RAW HDR photos and 4K video at 60 frames per second. It's not certain if there are upgrades to the cameras themselves or other key components.</p><p>Software may also play an important role. <em>Inverse</em><a href=\"https://www.inverse.com/tech/nothing-phone-2-kyle-kiang-software-investment-tech-enthusiasts\">claims</a> Nothing OS will be more &quot;distinct&quot; on the Phone 2, with a more polished experience developed in-house rather than outsourced. The phone maker reportedly has a much larger software team that now includes multiple veterans from OnePlus, Pei's former outfit.</p><p>Whether or not Nothing makes a significant dent in the US market is another matter. Apple and Samsung <a href=\"https://canalys.com/newsroom/north-america-smartphone-market-Q1-2023\">dominate</a> the American phone landscape, with even well-known names like Google and Motorola trailing well behind. OnePlus hasn't made significant inroads despite the backing of Chinese tech giant Oppo. The Phone 2 won't necessarily need to be a huge hit to succeed, but Nothing is facing rivals with many more resources at their disposal.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/nothing-will-reveal-the-phone-2-on-july-11th-120031997.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/nothing-will-reveal-the-phone-2-on-july-11th-120031997.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-13 12:00:31+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Skullcandy's $100 ANC earbuds promise a comfortable fit and custom EQ", "description": "<p>Skullcandy is known for its budget wireless earphones like the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/skullcandys-latest-cheap-earbuds-cost-just-20-120031703.html\">$20 Smokin' Buds</a>, but it's going a bit more upmarket with a new line of products.

It also has a \"Smart Mic\" option that reduces background noise so others can hear you better. You get up to 10 hours of battery life or seven with ANC on, along with an extra 25/20 hours (ANC off/on) when using the charging case.

Those include the ability to issue simple, hands-free voice commands (via its own device assistant) to turn on and adjust Stay-Aware mode, activate the device assistant, launch Spotify Tap and more. It's supposed to get smarter over time via new features released over-the-air on the Skull-iQ app. With Bluetooth 5.2, it comes with multipoint pairing, letting you pair to two devices at once, regardless of platform or manufacturer.</p><p>You can tune audio to your own hearing ability \"by taking a real-time audio test to create a personal sound profile,\" the company said. On top of that, it comes with custom EQ modes and you can also customize the buttons via the Skull-iQ app. One nice feature is support for Tile's Finding tech, so if you misplace an earbud, you can \"ring\" it using the Tile app.</p><p>The Rail, meanwhile, has no ANC but a bit more battery life, with eight hours in the earbuds and 34 hours in the charging case. As for charging speeds, 10 minutes of charge equals two hours of playtime. Otherwise, the feature set is the same, and they look identical as well. With both models, the company is promising a \"universally ergonomic fit,\" thanks to the use of VR and other \"cutting-edge\" design tools. The company didn't say much about sound quality in the PR, though.</p><p>The <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=17d37cd4-4773-4682-b78b-8e000b3d103f&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Skullcandy&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIxN2QzN2NkNC00NzczLTQ2ODItYjc4Yi04ZTAwMGIzZDEwM2YiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2t1bGxjYW5keS5jb20vcmFpbC13aXJlbGVzcy1lYXJidWRzLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMDVhMmQ5NDItNWVkNi00Y2FlLTg5YzAtNDE4OWNhZDNiYjBhIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAQsxt25R0UpqteAS03mAAIBFFKxS0oTjVF5uashTSCWy&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.skullcandy.com%2Frail-wireless-earbuds%2F\">Rail</a> (in True Black and Bone) and <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=17d37cd4-4773-4682-b78b-8e000b3d103f&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Skullcandy&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIxN2QzN2NkNC00NzczLTQ2ODItYjc4Yi04ZTAwMGIzZDEwM2YiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2t1bGxjYW5keS5jb20vcmFpbC1hbmMtd2lyZWxlc3MtZWFyYnVkcyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMDVhMmQ5NDItNWVkNi00Y2FlLTg5YzAtNDE4OWNhZDNiYjBhIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAcgKUNgXwdlEeoU3N-mIqSmK-V9aCaYE9lsQ4g-tXKzK&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.skullcandy.com%2Frail-anc-wireless-earbuds\">Rail ANC</a> (in True Black) are now available exclusively on Skullcandy's website for $80 and $100 respectively.</p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/skullcandys-100-anc-earbuds-promise-a-comfortable-fit-and-custom-eq-120023032.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/skullcandys-100-anc-earbuds-promise-a-comfortable-fit-and-custom-eq-120023032.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-13 12:00:23+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Amazon's Echo Studio smart speaker is $40 off right now", "description": "<p><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDdHOVkzWk1DP3RoPTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMTJxLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzNTZiMjNiOC0xMWRkLTRlMzEtYjU5YS0zZTQ3ZWNkZGVlMmQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARjwfQpu3Neugdd7sLMW6-szc4EqtHZIUhWVft3u1W0F&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07G9Y3ZMC%3Fth%3D1\">Amazon's Echo Studio</a> usually sells for $200 and rarely goes on sale, but you can get the supersize Alexa hub right now in Charcoal or Glacier for $160.

We called the Echo Studio the \"best sounding speaker Amazon has built\" in our review when it was released in 2019. The company has released more <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-smart-speakers-151515264.html\">speakers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-smart-display-202448797.html\">smart displays</a> since then, but the Echo Studio remains a solid option for immersive, high-resolution music streaming.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>We gave the Echo Studio a score of 88 in our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-15-echo-studio-review.html\">review</a> and praised it for having excellent audio quality best demonstrated by high-definition and Ultra HD tracks. While HD songs can show how much more detail you're getting with the device compared to normal tracks, the speaker can upmix regular stereo audio content with Dolby Atmos, giving it more \"space, clarity and depth.\" Because it has excellent audio quality, the Echo Studio also works great as a home theater speaker, though only with Fire TV devices. In addition to Dolby Atmos, the speaker also supports Dolby Digital and Dolby Digital Plus.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Like other Echo devices, the Echo Studio supports Alexa voice commands. You can ask Alexa, through the speaker, to play, pause or skip music, answer calls, play audiobooks and set alarms and timers, among many other things. One thing to note is that the Echo Studio requires more space than, say, the Echo Dot, at eight inches in height and seven inches in diameter. Amazon also recommends putting it in a place where it has six inches of clearance from walls. If space isn't an issue, the Echo Studio is an affordable option for what it can do, especially now that it's $40 off.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter and </em><a href=\"https://subscription.yahoo.net/Newsletter/Preference/sub?b=engadgetdeals&amp;src\"><em>subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter</em></a><em> for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/amazons-echo-studio-smart-speaker-is-40-off-right-now-113520048.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/amazons-echo-studio-smart-speaker-is-40-off-right-now-113520048.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-13 11:35:20+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The Morning After: Is the 15-inch MacBook Air any good?", "description": "<p>In a world where every Apple laptop is thin and light, do we still need to market some of them based on that alone?

The big innovation in <em>Alan Wake II </em>is the ability to swap between Saga and Alan, playing as both characters throughout the game.
