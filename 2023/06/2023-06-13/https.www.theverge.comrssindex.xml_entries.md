  <p id="gPVTia">Over 8,000 subreddits have gone dark to protest Reddit’s upcoming API changes, and it’s shown me just how much I rely on Reddit to find useful, human-sounding information in my Google search results.</p>
<p id="7uInDs">With Google’s generally poor search results nowadays, appending “reddit” has long been the default way I search for almost anything (and no, I’m not ready to get my info from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/4/23710071/microsoft-bing-chat-ai-public-preview-plug-in-support">an AI chatbot, either</a>). But given the sheer volume of subreddits that are currently unavailable — including some of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/13/23759674/reddit-mods-blackout-protest-extended-indefinitely">most-subscribed subreddits</a> — clicking through many Reddit links in search results takes me to a message saying the subreddit is private. </p>

  <p id="pATUKD">The Reddit blackout is in its second day as more than 8,000 communities go dark to protest the tech giant’s <a href="https://reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/13wshdp/api_update_continued_access_to_our_api_for/">plans to implement API pricing</a> that users say is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/">too high, too fast</a>. It’s created a ripple effect from bored people not being able to access r/relationships to academics missing r/AskHistorians. In the process, it’s also highlighted an issue that often lurks in the darkness: accessibility. </p>
<p id="T80bbV">Subreddits like r/blind, r/HardofHearing, and r/deaf are relatively small, but their concerns loom large in the protest. Some disabled users fear the API changes will threaten their ability to access the site.

  <p id="vR4kkv">Google just announced it’s rolling out a slew of Pixel Watch and Fitbit software updates. So many that it’s a bit confusing and all over the place, though the major highlights are nighttime blood oxygen levels (SpO2) and abnormal high and low heart rate alerts for the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23400779/google-pixel-watch-review-wear-os-smartwatch-wearable-fitbit">Pixel Watch</a>. </p>
<p id="Cbjefg">The blood oxygen tracking feature won’t be spot checks as on the Apple Watch or Samsung Galaxy Watch. Instead, the Pixel Watch will passively monitor your SpO2 as you sleep — the same as Fitbit does with its smartwatches. This is actually a good thing, as it lets you view longer-term trends as opposed to a single, random reading.<strong> </strong>Meanwhile, high and low heart rate notifications are a staple on modern wearables. Unlike EKGs for atrial fibrillation detection —...</p>

  <p id="v7nIWE">Pixar’s latest film <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/28/23659938/elemental-trailer-pixar-disney-release-date"><em>Elemental</em></a> hits theaters later this week — but we already have a new look at what’s in store for the company’s future. The studio released a teaser trailer for its next film, a sci-fi story called <em>Elio</em>, about a young boy who is abducted by aliens. Instead of the usual UFO hijinks, he ends up pretending he’s the leader of Earth when confronted with an interplanetary group known as the Communiverse.</p>
<p id="Qdo8u5"><em>Elio</em> is directed by Adrian Molina, screenwriter on <em>Coco</em>, and stars Yonas Kibreab in the lead role, alongside names like Jameela Jamil and Brad Garrett as alien ambassadors and America Ferrera as Elio’s mother. It hits theaters on March 1st, 2024.</p>
<p id="4dntQz">The new teaser comes as Disney announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23523523">a series of theatrical delays</a> tied to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/17/23687112/wga-strike-vote-authorization-amptp">t...</a></p>

  <p id="Swktca">An especially insidious form of turbulence has gotten worse because of climate change, according to new research. It’s turbulence that forms in cloudless skies that’s typically invisible to a plane’s radar, called clear-air turbulence. And it’s projected to become a bigger problem as the world warms. </p>
<p id="JZDx08">Severe clear-air turbulence (CAT) has already become more common, according to a <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023GL103814">study</a> published in the journal <em>Geophysical Research Letters </em>last week. On a typical flight route over the North Atlantic, there was a 55 percent increase in clear air turbulence between 1979 and 2020. While the increase in turbulence was the most pronounced over the US and North Atlantic, the study also found significantly more turbulence along popular routes...</p>

  <p id="1BQfc4">The most immediately enticing thing about a flip phone, at least if you ask a gadget lover older than about 30, is just the way it feels when it flips. The smartphone industry has never recaptured the way it felt to thwack your phone closed at the end of a phone call or the badassery of flicking it open as you bring it to your face. </p>
<p id="8gxB8Y">Ironically, the only real downside of the current crop of flip phones is that they can’t replicate this feeling, either. Because they’re bigger, thicker, and heavier than the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/3/4798828/status-symbol-motorola-razr">waif Razrs and Nokias</a> of the early 2000s, the only way to flip them open with one hand is to shimmy your finger between the two parts and then pry-slash-wiggle the device until it opens up. After a few minutes, you figure it out. But it...</p>

Here’s how to install the beta software on your iPhone or iPad once it’s available for your device.</p>
<p id="IFiozr">Before we get started, a word of warning: beta software is inherently unfinished and may contain bugs. Apple’s public betas (which are usually released around July) are generally more stable, but its developer betas are less so, and you should think carefully before installing them on any device you depend on. They also may not include all the features that will be in the final...</p>

But even though Telo’s truck will be mini and cute, it’s still apparently work-capable — the company claims it’s got “Toyota Tacoma capability,” but in the footprint of a Mini Cooper. That’s just about 152 inches.</p>
<p id="CT3yty">The Telo, like electric vehicles in general, can easily be compacted since it doesn’t need an engine bay up front and gas tank somewhere in the back. Instead, the batteries that power it can be stored in the floor and motors, of which the Telo has two outputting 380kW (500hp) total, can fit within a cylindrical area around the axles. Like many EVs, the Telo is promised...</p>

  <p id="3OCkvE">We knew that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2023/05/25/nothing-phone-2-carl-pei-talks-exclusively-about-the-iphone-challenger-release-date/?sh=80598b96fd88">the Nothing Phone 2</a> would arrive next month, and now we have a precise date: July 11th, a day shy of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/12/23203455/nothing-phone-1-price-release-date-specs-features">the Phone 1’s first birthday</a>. It’ll include a Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 chipset and a bigger battery, and it will launch in the US this time. We know all of this because Nothing has said so in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23745071/nothing-phone-2-specs-rumors-features">a series of spec teasers</a>, a tactic that founder Carl Pei loved to employ at the last company he helped found: OnePlus.</p>
<p id="Bld9Rd">Based on a teaser image accompanying today’s news, the Phone 2 looks like it will continue to offer the “glyph” notification lights featured on the back of the Phone 1. On that device, they’re partly a style flourish and partly practical since they can indicate different types of incoming notifications by flashing in...</p>

  <p id="1YNGrO">Microsoft is starting to enable file sharing in its Android feature for Windows 11. An update to the Windows Subsystem for Android is now available for all Windows Insiders to test and includes file sharing, drag and drop support, camera improvements, and the usual bug fixes.</p>
<p id="QBBN0N">“We’ve been listening to the community, and many of you have been asking us to support sharing files between Windows and the Subsystem,” says the <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/06/12/update-to-windows-subsystem-for-android-on-windows-11-june-2023/">Windows Subsystem for Android team in a blog post</a>. “We are pleased to announce that Windows Subsystem for Android can now share your Windows user folders, like Documents and Pictures, with the Subsystem, so scenarios like uploading a photo to a social media app or editing a video in a creative app work seamlessly.”</p>

  <p id="34WUyb">Netflix’s first live-streamed sporting event could be coming this fall. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/netflix-plans-first-live-streamed-sports-event-with-celebrity-golf-tournament-cd76c2c1?mod=djemalertNEWS"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> reports that the company is in talks to create a new, celebrity-driven golf tournament in Las Vegas that would include some of the stars of other sports content on the service like <em>Drive to Survive</em> and <em>Full Swing</em>. (Disclosure: Vox Media Studios produced <em>Full Swing</em>, and <em>The Verge</em> recently produced a series with Netflix.) </p>
<p id="74WhOy">The talks are apparently early, but a custom, talent-driven golf tournament makes perfect sense as Netflix’s first foray into sports streaming. Streaming live sports is high-stakes, hard, and expensive, and the deals for big-name events are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/22/23520130/youtube-nfl-sunday-ticket-shakeup-sports-streaming">ever more cutthroat</a>.
