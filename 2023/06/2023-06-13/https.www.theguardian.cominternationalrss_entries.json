(See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/sep/17/the-dry-completely-changed-my-life-jane-harper-australias-queen-of\">Jane Harper</a>, who does this for Australia.) Now I\u2019ve a new writer to shout about: Nilanjana Roy\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/black-river-9781782279433\">Black River</a></strong> (Pushkin Vertigo) takes place in the small village of Teetarpur, just outside Delhi. \u201cThere is nothing Teetarpur is famous for,\u201d writes Roy. \u201cThe village lies at the edge of the Delhi-Haryana border, an hour\u2019s drive down silent, forested roads covered in powdered summer dust. Its soul has remained half a century behind the capital.\u201d Munia is a shy, sweet eight-year-old, \u201ca brown scrap, so easily overlooked\u201d. But she is the apple of her single father Chand\u2019s eye. Almost as soon as the book starts, we see her murdered \u2013 hanged from a jamun tree \u2013 and then watch the village turn into a mob as her corpse is discovered, with suspicion falling upon a homeless man who was with her body. Sub-inspector Ombir Singh investigates, tries to prevent mob justice and, with his limited resources, digs to the core of a crime with long tendrils and dark origins. Roy brings rural India and Delhi to vivid life as much as she does her characters. The death of Munia is shocking and devastating: it is the mystery that drives this thriller but also its heart, as Roy tells of Chand\u2019s prior life, and his love for his daughter. Riveting.</p><p>It is bittersweet to crack open the 28th, and final, Inspector Banks novel. The mighty <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/oct/14/peter-robinson-obituary\">Peter Robinson</a>, who died last year, created one of the most convivial, compelling detectives in Alan Banks: compassionate, intelligent and music-loving, he was the sort of man you wanted to spend time with. <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/standing-in-the-shadows-9781529343168\">Standing in the Shadows</a></strong> (Hodder &amp; Stoughton) is a worthy addition to the Banks canon. It opens in 1980, in a Leeds living under the shadow of the Yorkshire Ripper, where student Nick discovers that his ex-girlfriend has been murdered, and that he is the prime suspect. We then move to 2019, when a skeleton that is most definitely not Roman is discovered on an archaeological dig near Scotch Corner in North Yorkshire, and Banks and his team are called in. Robinson handles his two plots with characteristic skill: the voice of student Nick is brought to enjoyably irritating life; and it is a pleasure to be back in Banks\u2019s company, whether it\u2019s watching him with his friends and colleagues, listening to his thoughts on music or waiting for his intuition to kick in and for him to see to the heart of things. Robinson was an author at the top of his game, and Banks a detective at the top of his. Both will be sorely missed by their readers.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/13/the-best-recent-and-thriller-writing-review-roundup-black-river-nilanjana-roy-standing-in-shadows-peter-robinson-a-death-in-parish-richard-coles\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/13/the-best-recent-and-thriller-writing-review-roundup-black-river-nilanjana-roy-standing-in-shadows-peter-robinson-a-death-in-parish-richard-coles", "date_published": "2023-06-13 08:00:43+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "Twenty-two troops injured in helicopter \u2018mishap\u2019 in Syria, US military says", "description": "<p>Ten evacuated to care facilities outside region after incident on Sunday that is being investigated</p><p>Twenty-two US service members were injured in a helicopter \u201cmishap\u201d in north-east Syria on Sunday, the US military said late on Monday, without disclosing the cause of the incident or detailing the severity of the injuries.</p><p>The military\u2019s Central Command said 10 service members had been evacuated to higher-level care facilities outside the region.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/13/troops-injured-helicopter-mishap-syria-us-military-says\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/13/troops-injured-helicopter-mishap-syria-us-military-says", "date_published": "2023-06-13 07:59:37+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "Sex trafficking: the fight to recover India\u2019s stolen children", "description": "<p>The Sundarbans is the world\u2019s largest mangrove forest and one of the most climate vulnerable locations on the planet.&nbsp;Climate change has taken an enormous toll on the rainforest in recent years, repeatedly uprooting families and decimating the incomes of residents who have traditionally relied heavily on agriculture and fishing for their livelihoods.</p><p></p><p>Now, repeated natural disasters and environmental changes to the region have created a highly vulnerable population increasingly at risk of participating in or becoming victims of child trafficking.</p><p></p><p>29 year old Subhasree Raptan started her fight against human trafficking a decade ago.
