<p>Veteran jockey did not expect to bow out on a horse with ‘great chance to win the Derby’</p><p>Frankie Dettori cannot even recall where he finished in his first Derby in 1992, but the one clear memory he retains from his debut in the Epsom classic underlines the extent to which he is a human bridge to a different age. “The only thing I remember is walking through the Gypsies [in the middle of the course] back in the day,” he said this week. “That was the only time I got to do that. From then on [after the paddock moved], we went all the way round [on the track].”</p><p>Devotees and historians of the Flat’s most famous race could also point out that it was one of the last to be run on a Wednesday, Lester Piggott was aboard the beaten favourite, Rodrigo De Triano, and Steve Cauthen and Pat Eddery were also among the 21-year-old Dettori’s rivals. And now, more than three decades later, his own time as the name that the once-a-year punters look out for on Derby day is drawing to a close.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/02/frankie-dettori-relishes-chance-to-ride-arrest-in-epsom-derby-swansong-horse-racing">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The latest reshuffle of NHS rebuilding plans does not put right a decade of neglect </p><p>When the flat roof of Singlewell primary school in Gravesend, Kent, <a href="https://schoolsweek.co.uk/the-ticking-time-bomb-leaving-schools-liable-to-collapse/" title="">fell in five years ago</a>, there was no sign of structural stress until 24 hours before it gave way. Luckily it happened at the weekend, and no one was hurt. But the incident had far-reaching consequences. The roof was made of RAAC, which stands for reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete. This was regularly used instead of normal concrete in public buildings in the UK from the 1960s until the mid-1980s, and its <a href="https://www.local.gov.uk/parliament/briefings-and-responses/office-government-property-raac-safety-briefing-notice" title="">lifespan is at an end</a>.

There isn’t even any evidence that “sentience” is a thing. More likely, like life, it is a bunch of distinct capabilities interacting, and “AI” (ie disembodied artificial intellect) is unlikely to reproduce more than a couple of those capabilities.</p><p>That’s because it is an attempt to reproduce the function of just a small part of the human brain: more particularly, of the evolutionarily new part. Our motivation to pursue self-interest comes from a billion years of evolution of the old brain, which AI is not based upon. The real threat is from humans misusing AI for their own ends, and from the fact that the mechanisms we have evolved to recognise other creatures with minds like ours are (as Freedland highlighted) too easily fooled by superficial evidence.<br /><strong>Roger Haines</strong><br /><em>London</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/02/the-existential-threat-from-ai-and-from-humans-misusing-it">Continue reading...</a>

<p>What’s often been a patronising and reductive archetype is given depth in a new season of films in time for Pride month</p><p>Before the gay best friend could be phased out, he had to come out. Today, those three short words tend to denote the most confining limitations to queer characters in film, a trope and archetype designed to keep homosexuality on the sidelines, adjacent to the more palatable lives and loves of straight people. For a time, however, sassy support was about the best representation queer people could hope for on screen, even if it required some code-reading on the viewer’s part. In Code-era Hollywood, ascribing a sexuality at all to the waspish single man commenting on, or even assisting in, the protagonists’ own entanglement would have been a detail too far. He had a name, a role, a handful of good lines. What more could he want – an identity?</p><p>Curated by the critic Michael Koresky, a mini-season of films on the Criterion Channel in June affords some depth and dignity to a character often demeaned as a patronising relic of now-outdated prejudices – even as it persists in film and TV today. Koresky’s selection delves beyond the romantic comedy realm where the trope made its most enduring impression, and into the realist dramas, psycho-thrillers and unclassifiable art films (Irma Vep, most unexpectedly) through which the gay best friend has evolved from a type to a human being.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/02/gay-best-friend-history-hollywoods-favourite-queer-character">Continue reading...</a>

One in a series of bills signed by DeSantis this year that escalated his assault on LGBTQ+ rights, the Protection of Children Act prohibits minors from attending “sexually explicit performances” and authorizes the punishment of businesses that knowingly allow children to attend such events by issuing fines and suspending or revoking their alcohol licenses.</p><p>The inaugural Pride month event that Bozanich organized in St Cloud last year featured an open-air parade and a drag show performance. This year, the 30-year-old photographer had scheduled a private event on 10 June at a gym that would once again include a drag show and would be open only to adults who had bought tickets in advance.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/02/florida-lgbtq-pride-month-ron-desantis">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The physical and emotional storm of pregnancy can dramatically alter the ways we see the world, in many cases irrevocably</p><p>Pregnant women often dream of death. I know I did, and friends told me the same, though no one talks about it with the level of commiserating jollity that they do the strange cravings or the weirdly enhanced sense of smell or even this awful thing called, apparently, “lightning crotch”.</p><p>While pregnant, I remember reading about how thin the veil between life and death can feel when you’re pregnant, even in a modern western medical system. In our collective unconscious, pregnancy is still something that can kill us, and in certain places and circumstances still does to this day. For many women, it’s the closest they feel to death in their lifetime. Which isn’t something that is really appropriate to put in a baby shower card.</p><p>Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist and author</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/02/parenthood-succession-finale-shiv-pregnancy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Supporters of the presidential candidate Ousmane Sonko have clashed with police in Dakar, throwing stones and setting vehicles alight, resulting in the death of at least nine people. Protests broke out soon after Sonko was sentenced to two years in prison for 'corrupting youth', an offence that includes having sexual relations with people under the age of 21. He was acquitted on charges of raping a woman and making death threats against her. Sonko's supporters say his legal troubles are a part of a government effort to derail his candidacy in the 2024 election. According to his legal team, the conviction will bar him from running</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2023/jun/02/deadly-riots-in-senegal-after-conviction-of-opposition-leader-ousmane-sonko-video-report">Continue reading...</a>

Like its 2018 predecessor, the newly released follow-up genuflects to its splashy source medium as it pushes the boundaries of animation, mashing up styles and textures into a free-associative, hyperkinetic torrent of psychedelic lines and color. The everything-at-once maximalist aesthetic befits a premise that explodes the wall between text and metatext with its setting in a multiverse of overlapping narratives, a pileup of Marvel-branded continuities.</p><p>And yet for all its cleverness in conception and design, the overall quotient of pound-for-pound entertainment has slipped in a difficult-to-pinpoint way.

## Good-value rosés for outdoor drinking

<p>We are buying more French-style rosé than ever, and showing a taste for more quality wines, too. And, if you know where to look, there are excellent bargains to be had</p><p>I’ve said it before, but I’ll say it again: good value is <em>not</em> the same as cheap. In fact, the French have the perfect description for it: <em>qualité/prix</em>, meaning good quality for the price. That applies to rosé as much as it does to any other colour of wine, if not even more so. There are under-£5 reds and whites out there that are really outstanding bargains (<a href="https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/310101015">Tesco’s 2022 Vista Castelli Trebbiano d’Abruzzo at £4.25</a> being a case in point), but I’m hard pushed to think of any sub-£5 rosé that rocks my boat. That’s rare even under £7, although Aldi, as ever, manages to achieve it (see today’s pick).</p><p>Cheap rosés tend to taste confected, bubble-gummy and often too sweet, both for my tastes and, it seems, the market generally: Californian rosé sales are down 20% over the past year, a Tesco spokesperson tells me, while French rosé is up 7%, which suggests that people now prefer the fashionably pale dry style of rosé they make in Provence.</p><p>For more by Fiona Beckett, go to <a href="https://fionabeckett.substack.com/">fionabeckett.substack.com</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/02/good-value-roses-for-outdoor-drinking-fiona-beckett">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A well-ironed white T-shirt tucked into dark jeans hits the right understated note – and there’s no need to pay through the nose for it</p><p></p><p>You will have heard, by now, about “quiet luxury”, which has (quietly) established itself as the dominant aesthetic* of 2023. (*Explainer: we don’t say “trend” any more. Aesthetic sounds a bit less … basic? Capitalist? But to be clear, in a fashion context it means pretty much the same thing.)</p><p>Quiet luxury is Gwyneth Paltrow defending her right to ski – something like that, the details elude me – cocooned in a creamy merino knit from The Row that costs more than a grand. (Like, how rich do you have to be to spend that on a sweater that isn’t even cashmere?) Quiet luxury is the subtle flex of Kendall Roy in an unbranded black baseball cap from Italian luxury house Loro Piana and Tom Ford sneakers. It is Mark Zuckerberg in his signature charcoal-grey T-shirt, which he orders from Brunello Cucinelli in Milan instead of buying from Gap.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jun/02/how-to-get-the-quiet-luxury-look-without-the-vulgar-price-tag">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From Cabaret to Streetcar, the West End’s hottest director has a reputation for finding leads who put bums on seats. ‘I just go on my gut,’ she says</p><p>How do you tell a story to an audience who already intimately know the ending? As a teenager, Rebecca Frecknall remembers watching Baz Luhrmann’s Romeo + Juliet with her sister. They both knew the grim fate rocketing towards its young star-cross’d lovers, but as Claire Danes reached for the gun, Frecknall’s sister let out an involuntary, “Oh no!” “Even though she knew it was going to happen,” Frecknall says with a soft smile, “she managed to get to a place where it still took her by surprise.”</p><p>It is this sort of stomach lurch that Frecknall is seeking as she directs Shakespeare’s romantic tragedy at London’s Almeida theatre this summer, starring Toheeb Jimoh and Isis Hainsworth. “I’m interested in the forward momentum of it,” Frecknall says during a lunch break in rehearsals, sitting next to a pile of recently snuffed-out candles that the stage managers have been testing, “how it just rolls down a hill towards its doom. But that’s also the challenge of this play. You’re always in conversation with the ending.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/02/rebecca-frecknall-romeo-juliet-director-interview">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Manchester City’s treble bid has been built not only on Erling Haaland but on subtle changes and innovations further back</p><p>“Talk about John Stones. Please, before Haaland.” And Pep Guardiola banged his head on the press conference dais in mock exasperation. It was September last year, at the height of Erling-mania, and Manchester City had just beaten Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League with a goal from their big new striker. But Guardiola was keen to shift the conversation elsewhere.</p><p>And in hindsight, Guardiola was not really joking. Instead, he was trying to give us a clue. He was, as ever, urging us to look beyond the superficial and see what was happening under the bonnet. The season that may well be remembered as the greatest in City’s history has been built not merely on the goals of Haaland and the assists of Kevin De Bruyne, but on the subtle changes and innovations further back. It has been, above all, the season of Stones.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/02/the-season-of-stones-how-barnsley-beckenbauer-sparked-citys-surge">Continue reading...</a>

The illustration professor already had three children from a previous marriage. But when his second wife, who was 43 at the time, made it clear she planned to be a mother, he soon learned that “changing nappies is a lot like riding a bike – you never forget how to do it”.</p><p>His daughter, who is now seven, was conceived using an egg donor. Zeegen, who is 59 and from Cambridge, says he is delighted that he went against “all rational thinking” to become a dad again – but notes that parenting is different when approaching 60. “I have a little less energy than I did at 27 with my first born.

<p>It’s undeniably seedy – but is the show a ‘toxic man’s fantasy’, as critics have said? Or is it a candid look at sex today? As 2023’s most controversial series hits our screens, we meets its stars</p><p>Months before it had even come out, The Idol was the year’s most controversial TV show. In March, Rolling Stone published an exposé featuring anonymous interviews with those working on the Lily-Rose Depp-starring HBO show, who alleged that its producers – megastar musician Abel Tesfaye, AKA the Weeknd, who also plays a lecherous nightclub owner/cult leader called Tedros, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/06/euphoria-review-zendaya-rue-sex-drugs-teen-drama-skins">Euphoria</a>’s Sam Levinson – had burned through time and money to make a series “about a man who gets to abuse this woman and she loves it.”</p><p>Following a pop star named Jocelyn (Depp) as she tries to mount a career comeback after a mental breakdown, The Idol is self-consciously pulpy and undeniably sordid: characters talk about wanting to make “giant fucking big-titted hits”, lock intimacy coordinators in closets, and say over-the-top things such as: “Will you let people enjoy sex, drugs and hot girls? Stop trying to cockblock America.” Depp spends much of the first episode topless, and the series is littered with allusions to contentious cult auteurs such as Paul Verhoeven and Gaspar Noé. When the first two episodes premiered at Cannes earlier this month, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/26/cannes-2023-peter-bradshaw-verdict-prize-predictions">critics slammed it</a> as a “toxic man’s fantasy”; for a moment, its Rotten Tomatoes rating was hovering around an almost unheard-of 9% (it now sits at 25%).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/02/im-not-used-to-seeing-sex-that-kinky-is-the-idol-the-most-shocking-tv-of-the-year">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This bill cuts programs for the most vulnerable, and is totally unnecessary – why doesn’t Biden invoke the 14th amendment?</p><p>Let’s be clear. The original debt ceiling legislation that Republicans passed in the House would have, over a 10-year period, decimated the already inadequate social safety net of our country and made savage cuts to programs that working families, the children, the sick, the elderly and the poor desperately needed.</p><p>The best thing to be said about the current deal on the debt ceiling is that it could have been much worse. Instead of making massive cuts to healthcare, housing, education, childcare, nutrition assistance and other vital programs over the next decade, this bill proposes to make modest cuts to these programs over a 2-year period. This bill will also prevent a global economic catastrophe by extending the debt ceiling until January 1, 2025 – when we will have to go through with this absurd process once again.</p><p><a href="http://sanders.senate.gov/">Bernie Sanders</a> is a US Senator, and the ranking member of the Senate budget committee.

<p>Their Saturday Night Fever soundtrack commanded the charts, but beyond that, notes Bob Stanley in an extract from his new book, their golden touch was audible everywhere from Grease to Sesame Street</p><p>Disco could be a heavy, unctuous perfume. There were reasons people hated it, and they weren’t all homophobic or racist. On the chart in 1977 was La Belle Epoque’s version of the German/Spanish 60s hit Black Is Black. Originally it had been a hit for another act with a tempting European name, Los Bravos. This 1966 version had been a thing of slab density, a three-note organ riff with a Charlie Watts clone’s monotone drumming keeping it simple as can be, and an unreal human voice, half-crow, telling the world “black is black, I want my baby back.” It sounded like the Stones fed through a telex precursor of Google Translate. It had been perfect – pop as monolithic simplicity. La Belle Epoque’s 1977 version added every imaginable bauble, it went “whooooo!!” on the beat. Musicians who longed to be in James Last’s orchestra played with funkless fingers behind girls who cooed unconvincing come-ons. This version of Black Is Black was a fug, like the ground floor of a department store, a dozen different perfumes hitting you at the same time, far too busy, forced fun, nauseating.</p><p>The Bee Gees’ Night Fever was not that dense, liquid perfume that made you feel slightly sick. This was not the sound of too much air freshener. This was air itself. Night-time air. The city. The song, taken from the soundtrack to Saturday Night Fever, also transmitted a feeling of nervousness; there was sweetness and there was fear.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/02/how-the-bee-gees-ruled-late-70s-pop">Continue reading...</a>

## Homies on Donkeys, London E11: ‘Astonishingly good’ – restaurant review | Grace Dent on restaurants

<p>Vibrant and nonconformist, this Mexican taqueria is the area’s most exciting new opening for a while</p><p>There is no cutlery at <a href="https://www.homiesondonkeys.com/">Homies on Donkeys</a>, a taqueria in Leytonstone, east London, that is run by Sandra Bello and chef Erik “Smokey” Bautista. “No cutlery, no exceptions, we got napkins, get messy,” it says on the single-sheet menu, alongside descriptions of their abundantly stacked tacos filled with reverse-braised bavette or confit pork with dripping, wobbling amounts of jalapeño relish.</p><p>This fork-free zone will come as a relief to some informal diners, who find all those butter knives, dessert spoons, cheese scoops and grape shears a bit bamboozling. It may, however, dismay anyone wearing a non-wipeable fabric such as cashmere. Homies on Donkeys is more of a sou’wester kind of place, with added salsa verde and chipotle on your chin when you pay the bill. It’s also a place for people who like 1990s hip-hop, graffiti-strewn walls and the sensation of eating in a suburban skate park: Naughty By Nature, Main Source, Gang Starr and Grand Puba blare from the stereo as I sit at a table that is absolutely nowhere near big enough for all the tacos, large plates, sides and drinks that we’ve ordered; we’re also wedged in next to the till, where the servers are constantly ringing in orders. While the seating may not be ideal, the soundscape just about makes up for it. This isn’t a 90s-themed restaurant, but if you’re of a certain age, remember the Beastie Boys back when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Y0cy-nvAg">they were gobby kids</a>, videoed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoaG31kL2m8">Dance Energy with Normski</a> on BBC Two or ever got grounded for tagging your neighbour’s garage, this place is like sensory whiplash with tacos on top.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/02/homies-on-donkeys-london-e11-restaurant-review-grace-dent">Continue reading...</a>

A team from Manchester score two improbable goals to rescue a final that had seemed lost. Having been behind with only a few minutes remaining, the goals spark wild celebrations, elevating the scorers to iconic status among the supporters.</p><p>Twenty-four years later this final is still considered a watershed moment in the club’s history. But the match did not take place in Barcelona but at Wembley – and the opponents were not Bayern Munich, but a club from Kent that had never been above the third level of English football.

<p>He may be older and wiser but the singer says his new album is his way of making the party last for ever</p><p>It has been six or so weeks since Toby, Jake Shears’s beloved 15-and-a-half-year-old border terrier, died. “It has been a rough time,” Shears says from his new London pad. (After prolonged stints in LA and New York, home, for the foreseeable, is England.) “We moved here together, and now there’s a big hole in my life. Toby’s death made me realise how much of a balm he was: if I was stressed, sticking my face in his fur always made me feel better.”</p><p>Work has helped this Scissor Sister turned solo singer through the grief. There is plenty to distract him. His new album, Last Man Dancing, has just been released; there’s a new podcast incoming, too. Plus two original musicals at different stages of development, DJ gigs, a weekly radio show, and that book he really keeps meaning to finish writing. “All that takes up space,” Shears assures me, “but I still spend time thinking about Toby. I light a candle for him every night; I sleep with his bear in my bed.

<p>Exhilarating, active, and doable in a lunch hour, urban fishing is booming among young people. Meet the new breed of anglers shaking up the banks </p><p>Graffiti, discarded beer cans, shouts from drunk punters spilling out of nearby bars … Few would describe Camden Lock as an angler’s paradise. But it’s on this stretch of London canal, far from the burbling chalk streams and tranquil ponds of the British countryside, where 22-year-old Tom Lloyd likes to fish. He’s been angling all over central London since he was a teenager. He first picked up a rod on a trip with a friend to Waltham Abbey in Essex, but quickly discovered he could fish far closer to home: “You can be in the middle of this urban setting with drunk people and beer bottles, but you’re just there catching fish with your headphones on,” he says.</p><p>Street fishing, also referred to as urban fishing, lure fishing or predator fishing, is a growing sport attracting a new, younger breed of angler. It is at its biggest in mainland Europe, especially Paris where an underground culture of millennial and gen Z anglers from all backgrounds is taking over the banks of the Seine. (When one of the movement’s pioneers, <a href="https://www.forevermissed.com/fred-miessner/about" title="">Fred Miessner</a>, died suddenly last year in a car crash, hundreds of French youth turned out for a fishing vigil.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/02/how-gen-z-got-hooked-on-urban-fishing">Continue reading...</a>

## Scotland’s glass bottle deposit plan is being kicked down the road by warring politicians | Kat Jones

<p>The environmentally sound scheme is being lost in a battle over who wields the real power after devolution</p><p>The latest constitutional crisis between the Scottish parliament and Westminster isn’t over an independence referendum or the high affairs of state. It’s about whether Scotland can recycle glass bottles more effectively. Last week, the UK government told Scottish ministers they <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/30/scottish-ministers-poised-to-back-down-in-recycling-row-with-westminster">couldn’t include glass bottles</a> in their long-planned deposit return scheme.</p><p>Doing so would violate the Internal Market Act, they said, which dictates that any condition devolved administrations wish to place on the sale of goods or services needs central government approval – part of Westminster’s post-Brexit reshaping of the way the UK works.

## Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds: Council Skies review – not enough irresistible everyman anthems

<p><strong>(Sour Mash)</strong><br />The ex-Oasis man’s new album has hints of psychedelia and Easy Now is great but there aren’t enough big galumphing choruses to bellow into the night</p><p>With <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/blur">Blur</a> about to release a new album and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/pulp">Pulp</a>’s return taking the form of a bustling summer gig schedule, all we need to make 2023 the return of the Britpop Big Three is an Oasis reunion. Alas, with Liam and Noel still scrapping, lately via the mediums of talkSPORT and Twitter, it looks like the closest we’ll get is another High Flying Birds record. Which is, admittedly, quite far. If the Gallaghers did miraculously patch things up at short notice, Noel’s solo project already has the perfect comeback track: Easy Now, the centrepiece of the outfit’s fourth album, is a vintage patchwork of lump-in-throat melodies, sleazy riffs, sentimental lyrics and a big galumphing chorus just begging to be bellowed into the cold black night.</p><p>The rest of Council Skies – a title Noel nicked from a book by his mate, the artist Pete McKee – is less moreishly nostalgic. The title track is a tinny, chugging slice of 00s indie that seems to go out of its way to produce as generic lyrics as possible (“Cause life is unpredictable / You can win or lose it all”) and although there are a few nods to the bright psychedelia and good-time glam of the band’s previous album, Who Built the Moon?, there is also much greying meat-and-two-veg guitar pop, which occasionally veers into old-man gentleness (see: the actually rather Blur-ish Dead to the World). Despite a handful of the elder Gallagher’s irresistible everyman anthems, much of Council Skies is unambitious and generic to the point of tedium.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/02/noel-gallaghers-high-flying-birds-council-skies-review-lacks-those-irresistible-everyman-anthems">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A fascinating history of cybercrime, from teenage pioneers to international bot armies</p><p>One of the most important figures in the history of cybersecurity is Matthew Broderick. In the 1983 movie WarGames he played David Lightman, a high-school computer whiz who hacks into the Norad defence system by mistake and almost sets off a thermonuclear war. The movie started a national conversation about the vulnerability of computers. President Reagan asked his security advisers: “Could something like this really happen?” Members of Congress screened clips in subcommittee hearings, leading to the first federal legislation on cybercrime. Before he was Ferris Bueller, Broderick was the fresh face of hacking.</p><p>Five years later, a Cornell graduate student named Robert Morris Jr designed a self-replicating “worm” to explore the network that connected the country’s computers, but made a crucial coding error. The worm grew too fast; the network crashed. The first person a horrified Morris alerted was his father, who happened to be one of the US government’s leading experts on data security. Media reports about this real-life David Lightman and his “Morris worm” introduced Americans to an unfamiliar word: the internet.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/02/fancy-bear-goes-phishing-by-scott-j-shapiro-hacking-for-beginners">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(New Amsterdam Records)<br /></strong>The LA collective Wild Up continue their celebration of the radical US composer with a wild and wonderful selection of minimalist-maximalist delights</p><p></p><p>Undersung and often ignored during his lifetime, Julius Eastman (1940-1990) is an artist whose influence and reputation seems to have grown exponentially in the decades since his death. Black, gay, impish and provocative – at a time when few contemporary American composers were any of those things – Eastman seems to speak with a certain urgency to 21st-century audiences. The latest of many recent tributes is this mammoth, continuing anthology of his work by the sonically omnivorous LA collective <a href="https://www.wildup.org/">Wild Up</a>. Eastman’s manuscripts are hard to find (many were infamously dumped on the streets when Eastman was evicted from his New York apartment in the late 80s; friends and lovers attest that Eastman even lined his cat litter trays with discarded manuscript pages), so Wild Up have had to diligently unearth scraps of scores and tapes of old performances to complete this seven-volume project.</p><p>After the ecstatic minimalism of <a href="https://wildup.bandcamp.com/album/julius-eastman-vol-1-femenine">Vol 1: Femenine</a> and the wonderfully demented <a href="https://wildup.bandcamp.com/album/julius-eastman-vol-2-joy-boy">Vol 2: Joy Boy</a> comes Vol 3: If You’re So Smart, Why Aren’t You Rich? The 20-minute title track, written in 1977, is the rarest composition here: a series of rising and falling chromatic scales that are slowly mutilated, complete with fiddly orchestrations, background countermelodies, vocal harmonies and instrumental freakouts that serve as a commentary. The 12-minute The Moon’s Silent Modulation, from 1970, is an episodic piece of serialism, featuring brief forays into discordant operatic harmonies, swing-style walking bass, rumbling cellos and two pianos that appear to be a fraction of a tone apart.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/02/wild-up-julius-eastman-vol-3-if-youre-so-smart-why-arent-you-rich-review-new-amsterdam-records">Continue reading...</a>

## McKinley Dixon: Beloved! Paradise! Jazz!? review – literary, urgent rap

<p><strong>(City Slang)</strong><br />This is shorter than the Virginian jazz-rapper’s sprawling breakout LP, but still full to bursting with images and invention</p><p>Richmond, Virginia rapper McKinley Dixon broke out in 2021 with <a href="https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/mckinley-dixon-for-my-mama-and-anyone-who-look-like-her-review">For My Mama and Anyone Who Look Like Her</a>, a lush collection of expansive jazz-rap tracks that made great use of his elastic flow. From bar to bar, he could shift gears from laconic and unbothered to tense and tetchy; the album’s improvisation-heavy production let Dixon stretch out and play, ducking and weaving through wandering upright bass and noodling horns.</p><p>Dixon’s fourth album tightens its lens: skipping by in 30 minutes, its songs possess a renewed urgency and velocity. But his writing is more literary and exploratory still. <a href="https://mckinleydixon.bandcamp.com/album/beloved-paradise-jazz-2">Beloved! Paradise! Jazz!?</a> (named after three of Toni Morrison’s most celebrated works) provides an embarrassment of imagistic riches: a king “ripping gold flickering flesh / Off his finger pads”; a sign in a bodega reads “‘What does your life entail?’ / Damn.” Dixon pays tribute to his hero Morrison – who he describes as “the greatest rapper of all time” – with this linguistic curiosity, uttered in his warm, often reedy, voice.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/02/mckinley-dixon-beloved-paradise-jazz-review-city-slang">Continue reading...</a>

## Protecting Bosnia and Herzegovina’s anti-fascist legacy: Mostar’s Partisan Memorial Cemetery

<p>The most significant anti-fascist architectural landmark in the former Yugoslavia has been neglected and left as a ruin for decades. Having survived the 1990s Bosnian war, the Partisan Memorial Cemetery in Mostar now faces its biggest threat – and possible disappearance – as organised neofascists are intent on destroying the necropolis and all it stands for. A small group of residents and activists are fighting to protect the cemetery and its history for future generations, but with a lack of political will, and facing fear of intimidation and attack, the Necropolis Defenders face an uphill struggle</p><ul><li><em>This story was supported by the <a href="https://pulitzercenter.org/">Pulitzer Center</a></em></li></ul><p>Mostar is the bucket-list city for every tourist to Bosnia and Herzegovina. Its Old Town features pre-Ottoman, eastern Ottoman, Mediterranean and western European architectural features and the rebuilt Unesco-designated Old Bridge that dates back to 1459. Every spring and summer the Old Town is visited by tens of thousands of day-tripper tourists and backpackers, yet only 10 minutes away, on the west side of the city, is another equally important historical landmark that sits abandoned and partially destroyed, where few tourists ever venture.</p><p>The Partisan Memorial Cemetery has no clearly visible ideological design or signage – it was supposed to mark a shared start for all the ethnic groups that made up Yugoslavia after the second world war</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/02/protecting-bosnia-and-herzegovinas-anti-fascist-legacy-mostars-partisan-memorial-cemetery">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The adverse effects on children’s mental health are well known, and pre-teens are too young to safely navigate the internet</p><p>But everyone has one,” pleads my son as his father and I tell him, for the umpteenth time, that no, he will not get a smartphone. Not now and probably not for a few more years. Despite our firm resolve, it is hard not to feel sorry for him. As the end of year 6 draws closer, the weeks are peppered with stories of new classmates whose parents have, as one friend texted recently, “cracked”. WhatsApp groups are springing up so that friends going to different secondaries can easily keep in touch. It is a world of interaction he will remain ignorant of, but, much though it pains me to see the turmoil it causes, I feel vindicated each time I read about the detrimental impact that smartphones are having on children.</p><p>One <a href="https://www.childrenscommissioner.gov.uk/resource/pornography-and-harmful-sexual-behaviour/">report published</a> earlier this year from the children’s commissioner, Dame Rachel de Souza, revealed that nearly a third of young people will have viewed pornography by the age of 11. Such content, De Souza clarifies, will not be the equivalent of “top-shelf” material some parents may have viewed in their youth and which today would be considered quaint. It is material in which “depictions of degradation, sexual coercion, aggression and exploitation are commonplace, and disproportionately targeted against teenage girls”.</p><p>Lola Okolosie is an English teacher and writer focusing on race, politics, education and feminism</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/02/teacher-smartphone-children-mental-health-internet">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Marriage is a dare and coupledom is complicated in this perceptive take on modern love</p><p>Coupledom, for the 22-year-olds in Naoise Dolan’s debut, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/17/exciting-times-by-naoise-dolan-review-a-witty-deadpan-debut" title="">Exciting Times</a>, is a fraught endeavour that can at best grant you temporary reprieve from the terror of your own brain and at worst lead to your complete annihilation. The slightly older pair at the centre of her new novel, The Happy Couple (they aren’t), are no longer spending most of their energies in relationships tallying the score. Now they linger on the qualities they love in their partners: his attention to detail; her love of music. Though the engagement that sparks this sharp-eyed marriage plot is almost an accident, the result of a passive-aggressive game of chicken gone too far, they will see it through. To do otherwise would require them to “share feelings”, which they do not do. “Have you met Irish people?”</p><p>It begins in Dublin, with a triangle. Celine is an aloof concert pianist with self-destructive tendencies living in the world of abstraction; her boyfriend Luke’s destructiveness tends to ricochet on to the people he professes to love. Maria, Celine’s ex, is intellectually and erotically a better match for her but interpersonally hard work. If an engagement pulls two co-conspirators into a seemingly airtight plot – everything hurtling towards the main event – in The Happy Couple, other people trouble the narrative’s unfolding.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/02/the-happy-couple-by-naoise-dolan-review-sharp-eyed-follow-up-to-exciting-times">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A generational football talent, a celebrated actor and now a chanteur with serious chops – the Frenchman is a polymath par excellence. He discusses politics, mortality and Pep Guardiola</p><p>Take Nick Cave, add a splash of Leonard Cohen, sprinkle with Serge Gainsbourg and you might have something approximating Eric Cantona’s first single. Yes, you read that right: The Friends We Lost is seriously good. The footballer turned actor turned chanteur whisper-croons his way through a gorgeous meditation on life with a handful of gnomic Cantona-isms thrown in for good measure (“Like a red snake in the water / In mind a winning number / Listen to the silence over the fear / The deep ocean that we can’t hear”). The single is just the start. Next up is a tour, a live album and a studio album.</p><p>Cantona tells me that, from childhood, he always hoped to play his own music on stage, but he didn’t think he had it in him. He hadn’t written any music, nor did he think he could sing. But in lockdown he decided to teach himself the guitar to help him write songs for live performances. The albums are by the by – gigging is the main attraction. “I’m still a bad guitarist, but good enough to write songs, and I wrote maybe 30. I did it just to go on stage, because I love the connection with an audience – football, theatre, music. And music, for me, was the dream.”</p><p>The infamous kick … Cantona gives Crystal Palace fan Matthew Simmons what for.

Jonathan Liew reports</p><p>This weekend Manchester City will contest the FA Cup final with Manchester United at Wembley. It’s the first time the two rivals have ever met in the final and represents the past and present of English football dominance. For years Manchester United were the all-powerful force, now it is Manchester City.</p><p>As <strong>Jonathan Liew</strong> tells <strong>Michael Safi, </strong>the transformation of Manchester City, from perennial also-rans to the most powerful club in the country, has been achieved in just 15 years. That current dominance can be traced to one crucial moment: the takeover of the club by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan of the Abu Dhabi royal family. The millions of pounds ploughed into the club have bought not just the best players but the best coach, the best medical staff, backroom analysers, scouts – and lawyers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/jun/02/is-manchester-city-dominance-english-football-fair-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
