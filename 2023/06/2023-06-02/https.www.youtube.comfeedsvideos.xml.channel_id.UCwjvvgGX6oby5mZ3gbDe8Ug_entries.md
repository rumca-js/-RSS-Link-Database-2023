In the last episode, we covered the story of this matter and concluded that the CCP's move was intended to use Micron's vacated market in China to drive a wedge between the U.S. and its allies and put the U.S.-led coalition against the CCP to the test. For example, they offered the vacated share of Micron in the memory chip market to South Korea's Samsung or SK Hynix as a lure.
Once the CCP uses its military power to attack Taiwan, the global economy will be greatly affected for sure, and no one can stay intact, away from it. South Korea will definitely be the first to bear the impact. At this critical moment, if South Korea doesn't opt for the U.S. side, it would face a major or lethal risk in the event of a conflict.
