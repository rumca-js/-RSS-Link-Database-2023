Prior to the pandemic, Robyn Hitchcock had never spent a protracted time off the road. While at home in Nashville, Hitchcock found he couldn’t stop writing songs. 

One of the results of those efforts is the new album, "Shufflemania!," released in late 2022. Hitchcock, touring once again, visited The Current studio to play songs from that album. Watch Hitchcock performing "One Day (It’s Being Scheduled)" during that session at The Current.
