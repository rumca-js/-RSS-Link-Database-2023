## Ron DeSantis gives a masterclass in shutting down heckler: "These are the people we beat every single day‚Äù

Conservatives chirping at each other over our preferred candidate is part of the process. I'm not innocent in that regard myself. But all of us on the right side should be able to enjoy watching any of our candidates shut down an interrupting progressive twat. So I give you Ron DeSantis vs. Karen McBecky today in South Carolina.</p><p>I think it's Karen McBecky. It was hard to make out what they were saying. All I could decipher was a) it sounded like a girl, and b) they sure couldn't calm down about something.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">MUST WATCH: Crowd goes wild as <a href="https://twitter.com/RonDeSantis?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RonDeSantis</a> ROASTS an enraged leftist who disrupted his speech.<br /><br />‚ÄúWe're not gonna let you impose an agenda on our kids. We're gonna stand up for our kids! ....

</p>
<p>DeSantis gets bonus points for working a campaign message into it too. He withstood all the leftist and media talking points (but I repeat myself) and didn't just win an election, he WON an argument. I keep going back to the fact the teachers union put out a poll looking for data to attack DeSantis with... <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/florida-school-board-results" target="_blank">and the poll came back in favor FOR him and against the union</a>.</p><p>That's all for the campaign trail between now and the Iowa caucuses. I'm wondering what Karen McBecky yelled. Here are my guesses:</p><p>"Is it DEE-santis or DUH-santis. America deserves to know?"</p><p>"<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/poltifact-book-ban-desantis" target="_blank">How dare you hired Penthouse forum letters from my kid</a>. Have you no shame?"</p><p>"<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-reporter-runs-away" target="_blank">Who is your favorite Disney princess</a>? Is it Anna?"</p><p>"Can you fall down so people will stop making fun of Biden?"</p><p>"Who would win in a fight between a taco and a mashed potato?"</p><p>What do you think Karen McBecky was yelling? Feel free to comment on the post or respond to the tweet that brought you here!</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Tim Scott to appear on "The View" after Joy Behar called him a bad black guy, but she won't be there

<img src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=33789996&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0" /><br /><br /><p>Joy Behar, like many white liberals before her, lashed out at presidential candidate Senator Tim Scott for not being a good black man. After all, in the eyes of Joy, you are only a good black if you agree with her white liberal opinions on anything. Scott is set to confront Behar over her racist rhetoric and will be a guest on "The View" -- the most trusted name in news for low information nincompoops -- but there is one problem. The show booked him on a day they knew the shrillest of the shrill harpies would not be there.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="3d0e4" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33790253&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Here's what Behar had to say <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/joy-behar-blasted-black-republicans-over-claim-tim-scott-doesnt-get-racism-sit-one-out" target="_blank">about Tim Scott and other black conservatives</a> who dare not agree with her:</p><blockquote>He's like Clarence Thomas. Ablack Republican who believes in pulling yourself by your bootstraps rather than, to me, understanding the systemic racism that African-Americans face in this country, and other minorities. He doesn't get it; neither does Clarence, and that's why they're Republicans.</blockquote><p>I'm sure Tim Scott, who grew up a black man with a single-black mother in the south, would have been enlightened to have Joy Behar, and old white broad, whitesplain raaaaaaacism to him. Maybe some other time <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tim-scott-the-view-joy-behar-presidential-campaign/" target="_blank">reports The Wrap</a>. Behar will not be present for the interview Monday, as it is her day off.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="a5216" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33790254&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>Behar's comments about Scott are not the only time she has lashed out about Black Americans. They are only her most recent.</p><p>In 2020, when black congressional candidate Kimberly Klacik called out Behar for performing in blackface, Behar told the black congressional candidate <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joy-behar-blackface-candidate" target="_blank">everyone loved her in blackface</a>.</p><p>In 2022, she seemed to not think black people understood how to obtain a legal firearm in America. She went on to say<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joy-behar-black-people-tiktok" target="_blank"> that once blacks were able to understand the process, we'd all be in trouble</a>.</p><p>It isn't even the first time she'd lashed out at Tim Scott. She is a real crab in a barrel when it comes to him.</p><blockquote>He does not seem to understand ‚Äî and a lot of them don't seem to understand ‚Äî the difference between a racist country and systemic racism. Maybe it's not a racist country, maybe Americans ‚Äî the majority ‚Äî are not racist. But we live in a country with systemic racism. And the fact that Tim Scott cannot acknowledge this is appalling.</blockquote><p>Again, this is Tim Scott:</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="edca7" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=33790284&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>And this is Joy Behar.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="1c16c" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=33790287&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>Tim Scott is still scheduled to appear on Monday, where we will no doubt get asked about Trump and how to pronounce "DeSantis." It would have been nice to see if Joy had the lady balls to challenge the senator's blackness to his face. My gut is that if she didn;t already have off, she would have called in sick.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Politifact changes definition of a "book ban" to claim Ron DeSantis bans books

But because Ron DeSantis signed a law saying schools won't provide it, leftists and the media (but I repeat myself) call in book banning. Politifact does now too. They just had to change the definition of banning books.</p><p>So we're all on the same page, this video <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-book-banning" target="_blank">shows the books that the media is upset aren't readily available</a> to Florida children in school.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Warning: This video contains pornographic images and content not suitable for children.

DeSantis said on the campaign trail ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not been a single book banned in the state of Florida.‚Äù Which is factually true.</p><p>So we're changing the definition.<a href="https://twitchy.com/sarahd-313035/2023/06/02/politifact-tweaks-the-meanings-of-words-in-order-to-slap-ron-desantis-with-another-false-ruling/" target="_blank"> Politifact using the "appeal to authority" fallacy</a> sites a partisan organization: </p><blockquote>"The American Library Association defines a "ban" as the removal of a book based on a person or group‚Äôs objection. It distinguishes a ban from a "challenge," which it categorizes as any push to remove or restrict materials.</blockquote><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Newspeak for "book ban" just dropped. <a href="https://t.co/Svhx62tWiz">pic.twitter.com/Svhx62tWiz</a><br />‚Äî Jeremy Redfern (@JeremyRedfernFL) <a href="https://twitter.com/JeremyRedfernFL/status/1664266287881781249?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 1, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>That is not the definition of a ban. That is an organization's opinion of what a ban is. It is the equivalent of saying not providing rated-R movies to students is a ban. Florida believes books <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chelsea-clinton-book-banning" target="_blank">about kids about tasting their vagina slime, how to give a handy to make someone cum, or read a graphic novel about two dudes f*cking</a> is not appropriate for school. Politifact and the American Library Association. appear to disagree.</p><p>This is what the left does. They <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/cdc-definition-emails" target="_blank">change the definition of schmaccine</a>. They <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/wikipedia-elon-musk" target="_blank">change the definition of recession</a>. In one instance, <a href="https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/1553101227889680384" target="_blank">they attempted to change the definition of "definition."</a> </p><p>The problem with Politifact doing it is that Big Tech companies use the "independent" "fact" checker as their excuse to throttle posts as "misinformation." Every post that correctly reports Ron DeSantis did not ban books is at risk at being throttled for no other reason than because Politifact says the American Library Association says so.</p><p><br /></p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

<p>This comes on the heels of reports the stock has entered bear territory. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2023/05/31/anheuser-busch-stock-enters-bear-territory-amid-anti-trans-bud-light-backlash/?sh=4e2c39231bfe" target="_blank">We go now to Forbes</a>:</p><blockquote>Anheuser-Busch InBev‚Äôs stock slipped 2% early Wednesday, continuing its dramatic slide against broader market gains and tanking to a new eight-month low of about $53.</blockquote><blockquote>Shares of the multinational beer giant have fallen 20% since March 31, the day before Mulvaney shared a video on TikTok showcasing the personalized cans of Bud Light sent to her by the company, commemorating the anniversary of her coming out as transgender.</blockquote><p>Forbes chalks it up to right-wing outrage over <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/james-okeefe-dylan-mulvaney" target="_blank">TikTok ing√©nue and titface performer Dylan Mulvaney</a> announcing dylanself as a new Brand Ambassador. Don't get me wrong. I'd love to take credit for it. But right-wing outrage only goes too far. Bud Light is in the toilet because <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-fenway-park" target="_blank">average, apolitical Americans are sick and tired of the work bullshit</a>. Global corporations think they need to pander to the radical left to get that sweet ESG cash.

See also <em>Stock Prices, Today's Target</em>.</p><p>Oh, and having your top executive insult your loyal fan base tends to be an unwise marketing move. The people who run Bud Light and Annheuser-Busch made it clear they hate the people who buy their product. The people are deciding to buy someone else's product as a result.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

Dorhauer is the pastor of the United Church of Christ in Ohio and has sinned. He has sinned against anti-racism with the release of a church calendar that didn't reach the commitment to anti-racism he and his church strives for. <a href="https://www.ucc.org/ucc-gmp-2024-desk-calendar-cover-does-not-reflect-commitment-to-antiracism/" target="_blank">Dorhauer issued a sniveling apology on the church's website</a> over the cover.</p><blockquote>It has been brought to my attention that a slight rotation of the cover image in either direction would more accurately reflect the racial equity we seek. I am grateful for such attention to the subtleties of racism and agree.</blockquote><p>Now, I'm sure I have you wondering, what could have possibly caused such an apology. The headline gives you a breadcrumb: it involves a white girl. Was the white girl calling the cops on two black kids playing basketball? Was she selling white girl tears? Was she culturally appropriating with braids in her hair while she did the Dougie?</p><p>Nope.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>Because in a cartoon description of a multi-cultural group of children equally spaced, laughing, and holding hands with each other, the little CARTOON white girl was on top. For this, he has sinned against the lord. The lord of Wokeness. He needs to say <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ibram-kendi-college-admissions" target="_blank">ten Ibram X. Kendis</a> and do <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/robin-diangelo-comedy" target="_blank">five Robin DiAngelos</a>.</p><p>Due to a cartoon of happy children on a calendar, Dorhauer was reminded "of the kind of diligence required to fully overcome the ravages of white privilege still embedded in our system, our psyche and our culture." He promises a new process to approve graphics will be put in place that aligns with the church's vision of "antiracism."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>While many in the woke cult are new to the game, credit Rev. Dorhauer for being true to the game. <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/an-open-letter-to-white-m_b_7857790" target="_blank">He goes back to a 2015 Huffington Post</a> blog post lecturing white men over all their whiteness. That's a full five years before it became a plank in the Democrat Party's platform.</p><p>More recently, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/03/01/new-college-florida-desantis-diversity/11373843002/" target="_blank">he attacked Florida Governor Ron DeSantis</a> over allowing opposing viewpoints on a single college campus in Florida. "I want to express my moral outrage at Gov. DeSantis willing to compromise and sacrifice the future, the vision, the hopes, the dreams and the safety of the students on this campus for his aspirations to serve as president."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>Dorhauer called for a prayer to God until "justice prevails and the evil of racism ends." The racism of a cartoon depiction of eight children living together in harmony.  That goes against all "anti"racist teachings.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

President Joe Biden fell down in public again. This time, in front of the graduating class at the U.S. Air Force Academy. The excuse is that he tripped over a sandbag, which... sure, why not. On CNN, a doctor suggested the elderly president start using a cane so he doesn't fall down as much.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Down goes Biden!

His GOP opponent is believed to either be the equally elderly 76-year-old Donald Trump or the much younger 44-year-old Ron DeSantis. Without a pandemic as an excuse to stay in the basement, you would assume more public appearances for Biden. That means more opportunities for "bad optics" of falling down like he did <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-falls" target="_blank">climbing steps in 2021</a> or <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-bike-memes" target="_blank">riding his bike in 2022</a>.</p><p>Doctor Jonathan Reiner said on CNN <a href="https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/kevin-tober/2023/06/02/wow-cnn-doctor-recommends-biden-walk-cane-stop-falling" target="_blank">he wants the president to start walking with a cane</a>.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"></div><blockquote>I would suggest to the President that he really needs to be careful and on unsteady ground it wouldn't be the worst thing for the President to use a cane.

</p><p>Both of his political opponents expressed their well wishes. Trump, who is only four years younger than Biden, <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/tv/i-dont-think-it-looks-good-for-you-trump-says-he-told-sean-hannity-to-stop-joking-about-bidens-cognitive-state/" target="_blank">told Sean Hannity. during an interview</a> he shouldn't make fun of old people falling down: ‚ÄúI said I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs good for anybody and, you know, it‚Äôs not appropriate. You can speak about it if you want, but I don‚Äôt think you should joke about it. And you really didn‚Äôt after that.‚Äù</p><p>DeSantis, who is thirty-six years younger the Biden, wished Joe Biden a speedy recovery. But also...</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">DeSantis on Biden's fall:<br /><br />"We hope and wish Joe Biden a swift recovery from any injuries he may have sustained, but we also wish the USA a swift recovery from the injuries it has sustained because of Joe Biden and his policies." <a href="https://t.co/DpUeaSIwF9">pic.twitter.com/DpUeaSIwF9</a><br />‚Äî Citizen Free Press (@CitizenFreePres) <a href="https://twitter.com/CitizenFreePres/status/1664481363469410305?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 2, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Joe Biden is back in Washington DC, <a href="https://twitter.com/Sprinter99880/status/1664524169306861568" target="_blank">where reports say he also banged his head on the door of a helicopter</a>. As of this writing, it is unclear what the president's schedule looks like today. But if I were to guess, probably another three-day weekend off in Delaware.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
