The\u00a0 legendary director Christopher Nolan is giving us his first R-rated film in over 20 years with Oppenheimer. And finally, another film we\u2019ll have to wait and see play out on the big screen is Studio Ghibli\u2019s \u2018How Do You Live?\u2019.

Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is still on track to be released later this year, but no exact release date was given. To hold you over, there's Final Fantasy 16 coming in just a few weeks. In other PlayStation news, PS5 players trying to get in on the early access of Diablo 4 were met with error messages. Blizzard is aware of the issue, but no official fix is out as of yet. A real bummer to players who shelled out extra money for one of the limited editions that promised early access. In Star Wars news, EA released some fun stats regarding Jedi: Survivor. The optional rancor boss killed 9 million of you. By contrast, Rick the Door Technician took down less than 500, which is still impressive considering Rick's difficulty. And in Nintendo news, there's some new and cute colors coming to the Switch Joy-Con. You can pair them with the upcoming Everybody 1-2 Switch, the sequel to the offbeat minigame collection from the system's launch.\n\n#IGN #Gaming", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Rjbec5JACM", "date_published": "2023-06-02 23:31:55+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Diablo 4: Act 2 Story, Dungeons, & Sidequests - Let's Play", "description": "Join IGN's Alan Wheeler on his Diablo 4 Act 2 let's play!
