<p>A Thursday start means this Test has seen fewer supporters in green than hoped, but those who were at Lord’s did not flag</p><p>There weren’t a great number of Ireland fans at Lord’s yesterday, but those that were there made themselves visible. The green shirts picked each other out in the crowd, nodded, waved and offered mutual support. A couple of them, puffing their way to the top of the Warner Stand before play, spotted a man in a splendid shamrock-print suit and altered course to share a rueful word with him. “We thought we’d better come today because it might be all over tomorrow.”</p><p>Not quite, but it was a day of unremitting flagellation. Throughout the first session, the Ireland bowlers had nothing to keep them going but the memory of a single, day-old wicket. At least their supporters in the stands had Guinness.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/02/ireland-fans-few-in-number-but-big-on-enthusiasm-despite-teams-struggles">Continue reading...</a>

## Helmut Berger obituary

Film actor whose hypnotic presence was central to a trio of films directed by Luchino Visconti in the late 1960s and early 70s<p>With his glacial blue eyes, blade-like face and feline elegance, Helmut Berger, who has died aged 78, was one of the most ravishing and hypnotic actors in postwar European cinema, and a lingering presence even after his best days were behind him. He was also Vogue’s first male cover star; the magazine photographed him in 1970 alongside his then-girlfriend, the model Marisa Berenson, while he was simultaneously in a relationship with the director Luchino Visconti. Madonna, who featured him in her controversial 1992 coffee-table book Sex, cited among her influences “every movie that Visconti ever made starring Helmut Berger”.</p><p>The first of these films – and only Berger’s fourth screen appearance – was The Damned (1969), an unrestrainedly lurid melodrama charting the decline of a fictional family of industrialists, loosely based on the Krupps family, and the rise of nazism in early-1930s Germany. As Martin von Essenbeck, heir to a steel dynasty, Berger is first seen sitting astride a chair on stage at his grandfather’s birthday party, dressed as Marlene Dietrich in The Blue Angel, singing “Children, this evening I’ll choose something for me / A man, a real man.” In blond wig, cocked silver hat, feather boa, stockings and suspenders, he tries unsuccessfully to persevere with his performance after it is interrupted by news of the burning of the Reichstag. Berger later received a photograph from Dietrich, on which she had written: “Who’s prettier? Love Marlene.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/02/helmut-berger-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

Their sexy plan, however, is cockblocked when a colleague snatches it up – “Donna forgot her key!” – and gives it bloody well back.</p><p>Didn’t matter. Point made.

<p>Dodgy plotting, confusing character motivations and the distinct sense that it had fallen in love with itself – the tale of the Roys was good. But not as good as it thought it was</p><p>There are many things Succession landed right on the jaw. The ranks of writers and executive producers brought with them great experience of many areas central to the show: politics, finance, five-star hospitality and, of course, the media. So no doubt the concept of the day five contrarian hit piece will be familiar to them.</p><p>I come not to bury Succession – maybe to even praise it a bit – but all the hype around this show has gone too far. On Tuesday morning, after watching Shiv, Ken and Romey zing at one another one final time I felt like that rogue dude in The Lego Movie. Everything about Succession, it seemed, was awesome. Not only that, it was insightful. The characters were multifaceted, many-layered scum that you would also really miss. It was the show that caught the spirit of our time, and all from the perspective of those ambling on to a private jet.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/02/was-i-alone-in-finding-succession-overrated">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Heatwave continues in south-east Asia as temperatures exceed 40C in vast swathes of region </p><p>Shanghai in China has reported a record high temperature of 36.7C, breaking the previous record by 1C. The new high temperature on 29 May comes amid the heatwave affecting southern and eastern Asia since mid-April. Vast swathes of the region have had temperatures exceeding 40C, with parts of Pakistan reaching almost 50C in mid-May.</p><p>South-east Asia has been affected particularly badly, with record high national temperatures in Laos (43.5C), Vietnam (44.2C), and Thailand (45.4C). The heatwave is attributed to low amounts of rainfall over the previous winter, resulting in drier soils that can heat up more quickly than moist soils, thus exacerbating the effect.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/02/weather-tracker-shanghai-reports-record-high-temperature-of-367c">Continue reading...</a>
