Tom Holland gives us an update on Spider-Man 4 and when we can expect it, if at all. #Spiderman4 is something many fans are looking forward to, and now we know where in the production process the upcoming #MCU movie is. We’ve got some #SpiderMan Across the Spiderverse news that’ll excite Spidey fans. The  legendary director Christopher Nolan is giving us his first R-rated film in over 20 years with Oppenheimer. And finally, another film we’ll have to wait and see play out on the big screen is Studio Ghibli’s ‘How Do You Live?’. The upcoming anime has been promoted as being Miyazaki’s final directorial film.

## Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Still Arriving This Year Despite Silence from Square Enix - IGN Daily Fix

In today's Daily Fix:

Square Enix has been awfully quiet about anything FF7, but they did drip-feed some news today. Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is still on track to be released later this year, but no exact release date was given. To hold you over, there's Final Fantasy 16 coming in just a few weeks. In other PlayStation news, PS5 players trying to get in on the early access of Diablo 4 were met with error messages. Blizzard is aware of the issue, but no official fix is out as of yet. A real bummer to players who shelled out extra money for one of the limited editions that promised early access. In Star Wars news, EA released some fun stats regarding Jedi: Survivor. The optional rancor boss killed 9 million of you. By contrast, Rick the Door Technician took down less than 500, which is still impressive considering Rick's difficulty. And in Nintendo news, there's some new and cute colors coming to the Switch Joy-Con. You can pair them with the upcoming Everybody 1-2 Switch, the sequel to the offbeat minigame collection from the system's launch.

System Shock reviewed by Jon Bolding on PC.

Nightdive's remake masterfully brings most of the aspects that haven’t aged as well into the present day, with excellent new graphics and nearly all the modern gameplay conveniences you could want. Tweaking the technical workings of Citadel space station to come out on top and foil SHODAN's machinations is just as compelling as it ever was, making the original System Shock one of gaming's classics for a very good reason.

## Should James Gunn Nuke The Snyderverse? | Super Debatable

James Gunn and Peter Safran, the newly-minted heads of DC Studios, have been busy teasing their roadmap for the DCU's Chapter One - Gods and Monsters. The ambitious ten-year plan of connected storytelling across movies, TV, and video games means the future for Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, and the rest of the Justice League is bright, but embracing all that possibility may mean having to say goodbye to the world-building and casting done during the Zack Snyder era.
