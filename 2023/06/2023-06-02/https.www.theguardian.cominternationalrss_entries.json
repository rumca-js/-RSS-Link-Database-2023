As Martin von Essenbeck, heir to a steel dynasty, Berger is first seen sitting astride a chair on stage at his grandfather\u2019s birthday party, dressed as Marlene Dietrich in The Blue Angel, singing \u201cChildren, this evening I\u2019ll choose something for me / A man, a real man.\u201d In blond wig, cocked silver hat, feather boa, stockings and suspenders, he tries unsuccessfully to persevere with his performance after it is interrupted by news of the burning of the Reichstag.
