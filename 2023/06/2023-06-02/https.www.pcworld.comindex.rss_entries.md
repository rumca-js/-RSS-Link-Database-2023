<p>Microsoft launched Cortana as an AI assistant and the flagship feature of Windows 10 in 2015. Now, eight years later, Microsoft is pulling the plug.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/end-of-support-for-cortana-in-windows-d025b39f-ee5b-4836-a954-0ab646ee1efa&amp;xcust=2-2-1940445-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">support document</a>, Microsoft said that it&rsquo;s ending support for the Cortana app, Cortana&rsquo;s only remaining presence within Windows. Instead, Microsoft said it will encourage users to use other AI-powered features, whether it be within a standalone app or simply part of Windows or Microsoft Edge.</p>



<p>Microsoft did say that Cortana will still be available within Outlook Mobile and various versions of Teams, including Microsoft&rsquo;s conferencing solution, Teams Rooms. Microsoft has used Cortana to provide a &ldquo;daily briefing,&rdquo; summarizing your Outlook emails in a glanceable synopsis. That functionality is now branded as Microsoft Viva, however. </p>



<p>&ldquo;We know that this change may affect some of the ways you work in Windows, so we want to help you transition smoothly to the new options,&rdquo; Microsoft said.</p>



<p>What killed Cortana? AI. Microsoft didn&rsquo;t explicitly say so, but it appears that the company believes that other AI-infused services, such as <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1924008/windows-copilot-will-bring-ai-into-windows-11.html">Windows Copilot</a> and the Bing Chat services within <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1656353/microsoft-edge-copilot-adds-ai-content-creation-to-your-browser.html">Microsoft Edge Copilot</a> and Microsoft 365 Copilot can fill the bill.</p>



<p>The writing on the wall outlining Cortana&rsquo;s demise was etched years ago, when Microsoft began phasing out Cortana&rsquo;s presence: <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3526472/windows-10-20h1-review-microsoft-boosts-linux-and-your-phone-but-cortana-slips-hard.html">removing it from the Windows shell</a> and separating it into an app, then gutting it to the point (initially) where <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/398829/microsofts-new-cortana-app-doesnt-know-the-answer-to-22.html">it couldn&rsquo;t do basic math</a>. In 2020, Andrew Shuman, Microsoft&rsquo;s corporate vice president in charge of Cortana, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/399164/why-cortana-wont-be-at-microsoft-build.html#:~:text=Andrew%20Shuman%2C%20Microsoft%E2%80%99s%20corporate%20vice%20president%20in%20charge,2020%20release%20itself%20was%20in%20flux%20until%20recently.">told PCWorld</a> that Cortana&rsquo;s development was pinched between the pandemic and the lack of available on-site resources. It was then that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/399164/why-cortana-wont-be-at-microsoft-build.html">Microsoft made the pivot</a> from using Cortana as a personal AI app to making it simply representative of Microsoft&rsquo;s productivity push. </p>



<p>In 2015, Cortana was something new and incredible, the flagship feature of Windows 10. Now, she&rsquo;ll just be another Microsoft consumer initiative that fell by the wayside. RIP.</p>

## Gmail integrates AI into its mobile app, sort of

<p>One of the reasons Google&rsquo;s Gmail achieved mass adoption was because it found which email you were searching for, fast. Now Gmail is revamping the process, calling out the emails it thinks you&rsquo;re searching for&mdash;or should be.</p>



<p>Google said Friday that Gmail will call out the most important emails inside a separate &ldquo;top results&rdquo; box, using &ldquo;machine learning models [that] will use the search term, most recent emails and other relevant factors to show you the results that best match your search query,&rdquo; Google said in a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/06/see-top-search-results-first-in-gmail.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1940339-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>. Other results will appear below, in an &ldquo;all results in mail&rdquo; category, sorted by recency.</p>



<p>Google referred to the new search option as a &ldquo;highly requested feature,&rdquo; and it will be rolling out over the course of 15 days, beginning on June 2. The feature will be available to those users who have personal email accounts as well as those <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393611/googles-g-suite-becomes-google-workplace-with-a-new-unified-ui.html">who subscribe to Google Workspace</a>. </p>



<p>Right now, the change to Gmail&rsquo;s search results applies only to the mobile app. Google hasn&rsquo;t offered a timetable for when this feature will come to the desktop version of Gmail.</p>



<p>If you use Outlook, you&rsquo;re probably aware that Microsoft&rsquo;s app does something very similar, organizing any search into a &ldquo;top results&rdquo; box as well as chronological search results. (The Mail app within Windows does the same thing.) The reason for doing this is apparently to call out results by relevance, rather than letting a reader assume the first result is simply ordered by the most recent email exchange.</p>

<p>For anyone who grew up with Google, of course, this is slightly odd. One of the reasons Google and Gmail took off was because Microsoft&rsquo;s integrated search was so horrific that new users flocked to Gmail just so they could find an old email. Google seems to be saying that its previous approach wasn&rsquo;t paying off.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;re also not sure if or how this will affect your ability to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393978/how-to-clean-up-your-gmail-inbox-by-quickly-deleting-old-email.html">clean up your Gmail inbox</a>, which involves using Google&rsquo;s search and filter tools to identify and delete old, unwanted email&mdash;or just <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/563899/out-of-gmail-storage-reclaim-space-by-moving-emails-to-a-new-account.html">set up a backup account</a>. Given that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393702/how-googles-new-policy-affects-your-free-storage-in-photos-and-drive.html">Google seems to be in the business of selling additional storage</a>, we&rsquo;re not sure <em>that</em> will ever change. </p>

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>The hottest trend at Computex 2023 is <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1937700/2023s-biggest-desktop-pc-trend-the-war-on-cables.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">The War on Cables</a>, in which PC accessory manufacturers are doing everything they can to hide power and data cables in PC builds. While a lot of the solutions thus far have been very specific to one brand, like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1939045/hands-on-with-icue-link-corsairs-one-cable-to-rule-them-all.html">Corsair&rsquo;s proprietary iCue Link daisy chain cooling</a> or <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1936904/asus-made-a-graphics-card-with-no-power-cables.html">Asus&rsquo; motherboard-GPU combo</a>, case maker SilverStone is here to offer some more modular, wide-open solutions. Gordon Ung reports from the front lines. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>SilverStone offers a pair of new full-sized ATX PC cases, the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.silverstonetek.com/en/press-release/23NCL?page=1&amp;xcust=2-1-1940124-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">C-341 and C-542</a>, both of which are compatible with motherboards that have rear-facing power and data cable connections. That lets you route all your power supply rails on the back of the case, effectively making every cable (except those for your GPU and whatever&rsquo;s cooling your processor) disappear. The MSI and Asus motherboards on display in the cases on the show floor demonstrate how clean the internal builds are, even using components from different manufacturers. Even the rear of the cases are slightly wider to accommodate all those cables. </p>



<p>The SilverStone C-341 is especially interesting, because it flips the usual internal motherboard layout for cases. The motherboard is mounted to the left side of the case&rsquo;s frame, not the right, and the right side of the case is open to access the primary chamber. With the bottom-mounted power supply, that puts the PCIe ports on the top of the case instead of the bottom, which might make heat management a lot easier&mdash; you can exhaust those fans right out of the top of the enclosure. Neat. </p>



<p>Both cases are full retail designs, not concepts, so they should be hitting the market later this year.

</div>


<p>Most game controllers ape the Xbox controller, which is supported equally well on the Xbox consoles and Windows. The 8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller, however, borrows equally from the Xbox and <a href="https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&amp;cx=50b714da855b604aa&amp;q=https://www.pcworld.com/article/399217/how-to-use-a-switch-pro-controller-with-a-pc.html&amp;sa=U&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjM0OHnj5H_AhWTm2oFHWW8AyEQFnoECAQQAg&amp;usg=AOvVaw2XI-aTwArFah6lc3Up_kUw">Nintendo Switch Pro</a> gamepads to create a durable, feature-rich controller that could be perfect for all your gaming endeavors&mdash;provided you can get past the learning curve.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Further reading:</strong> See our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1435842/best-xbox-controller-for-pc.html">best Xbox controllers for PC</a> to learn about competing products.</p></blockquote>



<h3 id="8bitdo-ultimate-controller-design-and-build-quality">8BitDo Ultimate Controller design and build quality</h3>



<p>The 8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller has an interesting mixture of design elements. It&rsquo;s the same approximate size and shape as the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/831843/xbox-wireless-controller-review.html">Xbox Series S/X controller</a>, offering a more hand-friendly feel than the Switch Pro controller. The chassis is smooth matte plastic, except for the bottom of the grips, which have a fine bumpy texture like the Xbox controller. There are no exposed screws, but there are a few unsightly seams.</p>



<p>There are buttons in all the places you&rsquo;d expect, but this controller has the Switch button layout instead of the Xbox one. The remainder of the layout is bog standard for Windows and Switch controllers. There are two asymmetrical thumbsticks, a d-pad, and the shoulder buttons and triggers up top. The 8BitDo Ultimate Controller also has face buttons for select/start, turbo, menu, and profile swapping. Flip the device over, and you&rsquo;ll see two more buttons on the grips. These are fully customizable in the 8BitDo app.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="8BitDo Ultimate " class="wp-image-1931948" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/8BitDo-Ultimate-10.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The 8BitDo Ultimate Controller&rsquo;s <br />underside is home to two customizable buttons, a switch for Bluethooth / 2.4GHz selection, and contacts for the included dock.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Ryan Whitwam / Foundry</p></div>



<p>The thumbsticks stand out from the crowd with their &ldquo;Hall effect&rdquo; sensing mechanism. Most gamepads use electrical resistance to track thumbstick position, but the 8BitDo Ultimate Controller uses magnets. This makes the hardware immune to drifting&mdash;a common type of hardware failure that causes thumbsticks to register movement at rest.</p>



<p>Dead center on the back are two important hardware features: a switch to flip the controller between Bluetooth and 2.4GHz, and a trio of contacts that connect the controller with the included dock. The dock charges the controller and has built-in 2.4GHz support when connected to a PC over USB. There is also a USB-C port on the top edge of the Ultimate Controller, but the dock is a much more convenient way to keep it topped up.</p>



<h3 id="8bitdo-ultimate-controller-features-and-hands-on-experience">8BitDo Ultimate Controller features and hands-on experience</h3>



<p>The 8BitDo Ultimate Controller is one of the most comfortable wireless controllers we&rsquo;ve tested thanks to the compact form factor and low mass. You can tell as soon as you pick up the 8BitDo that it&rsquo;s on the light side&mdash;228g, to be precise. That&rsquo;s a big drop from the Xbox controller at more than 300g with batteries.</p>



<p>The d-pad doesn&rsquo;t have the useful dish shape of Microsoft&rsquo;s newer controllers, but the plain cross-shaped control is more stable and accurate than the Switch Pro Controller. The ABXY buttons have a nice, tactile feel, too. However, you&rsquo;ll have to adjust to the Switch button layout. All the system buttons are clustered toward the middle of the controller, making them easy to reach but keeping them out of range of accidental presses.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="8BitDo Ultimate " class="wp-image-1931944" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/8BitDo-Ultimate-6.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The  8BitDo Ultimate Controller<br />uses the Switch layout.  </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Ryan Whitwam / Foundry</p></div>



<p></p>



<p>We&rsquo;re quite smitten with the thumbsticks, which are buttery smooth and fully customizable, thanks to the Hall-effect sensors. In 8BitDo&rsquo;s Ultimate software, you can control the size of the dead zones, flip directions, and more. That same freedom extends to the rest of the controls, which are fully configurable in the app. This is also where you can map buttons to the paddle buttons.</p>



<p>The Ultimate software is overall good once you get the hang of it. The interface is sometimes inconsistent, but it&rsquo;s serviceable to map buttons and adjust profiles. However, you have to use USB or 2.4GHz to sync&mdash;we had general issues with Bluetooth support on Windows. You&rsquo;ll want to leave it in 2.4GHz mode for PC gaming and switch to Bluetooth for Switch and mobile.</p>



<p>8BitDo claims 22 hours of play time per charge. We didn&rsquo;t get quite that much, but with a mix of Bluetooth and 2.4GHz, the 8BitDo Ultimate made it over 18 hours before dying. An Xbox controller will last you longer, but the 8BitDo Ultimate has a built-in 1,000mAh battery, whereas Microsoft&rsquo;s base model controller still needs AAs or an add-on rechargeable pack. Regardless, the 8BitDo Ultimate lasts more than long enough, and the charging dock makes it easy to keep it juiced up.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Even if you don&rsquo;t have a Switch, the 8BitDo Ultimate is one of the best PC controllers in terms of hardware and features.</p></blockquote></figure>



<h3 id="8bitdo-ultimate-controller-compatibility">8BitDo Ultimate Controller compatibility</h3>



<p>8BitDo makes two very similar Ultimate controllers. The Bluetooth version we are testing has the widest compatibility. With a USB-C port, it&rsquo;s easy to connect the controller to a PC or console the old-fashioned way if you so choose. This version retails for $70, and the non-Bluetooth is $50. That version only has 2.4GHz support for PC gaming&mdash;no Switch or mobile Bluetooth support.</p>



<p>For wireless mode, you&rsquo;ll want to stick with 2.4GHz on Windows, which works much better than Bluetooth. If you use Steam, there are some settings for controlling how non-Xbox controllers are used. For mobile devices or the Nintendo Switch, Bluetooth is the way to go. If you&rsquo;re a Switch owner, this device offers a big upgrade over the Joy-Cons. It even has a gyroscope inside, so you&rsquo;ll get the full Switch experience.</p>



<p>The button layout will be the biggest compatibility issue. Depending on the settings and button mapping, your in-game controls might not match the legends on the buttons, or the ABXY button order will be different. In either case, switching to this controller will come with a bit of a learning curve. If you aren&rsquo;t already committed to the standard Xbox layout, then it&rsquo;ll be easy to adapt.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img alt="8BitDo Ultimate " class="wp-image-1931946" height="799" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/8BitDo-Ultimate-5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>A USB-C port makes the 8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller<br />compatible with a variety of devices.      </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Ryan Whitwam / Foundry</p></div>



<h3 id="is-the-8bitdo-ultimate-controller-worth-it">Is the 8BitDo Ultimate Controller worth it?</h3>



<p>The 8BitDo has a lot going for it with the Ultimate Controller. The compact, lightweight design makes it comfortable to hold for long periods, and the Hall-effect thumbsticks should be perfectly smooth for years to come. We also like having a full customization app to adjust controller settings, including the option to assign controls to the rear paddle buttons.</p>

<p>The 8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller has wide compatibility, including Windows, Nintendo Switch, Android, and iOS. The option to use 2.4GHz and Bluetooth is appreciated, but it would be nice if Bluetooth wasn&rsquo;t buggy on Windows. On the upside, 8BitDo includes a charging dock with the controller, and it has a 2.4GHz dongle built-in. So, you might have to toggle the wireless mode, but we&rsquo;ve had no trouble using the Ultimate Controller on our devices.</p>



<p>You will pay a little more for this controller&mdash;it&rsquo;s $70 versus about $60 for the standard Xbox gamepad. However, 8BitDo&rsquo;s controller has an integrated rechargeable battery and more robust hardware. The biggest issue for PC gamers will be the button layout, which follows the Switch arrangement.</p>



<p>If you play games on both Switch and PC, this controller is a no-brainer. Even if you don&rsquo;t have a Switch, the 8BitDo is one of the best PC controllers in terms of hardware and features.</p>

<p>Us mighty Photoshop masters might look down on the humble Microsoft Paint, but at least you can use it without signing a second mortgage over to Adobe. Between that, its collection of easy, straightforward tools, and the fact that it&rsquo;s been packed in free with every copy of Windows for almost 40 years, it&rsquo;s easy to see why Paint remains popular, even when Microsoft neglects it. Today it&rsquo;s getting a long-overdue upgrade: <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/06/01/updated-paint-app-for-windows-11-begins-rolling-out-to-windows-insiders-with-dark-mode-and-zoom-improvements/&amp;xcust=2-1-1939999-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">compatibility with Windows&rsquo; Dark Mode</a>. </p>



<p>You&rsquo;d think adding Dark Mode compatibility would be trivial, but <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/2/23746471/microsoft-paint-dark-mode-windows-11&amp;xcust=2-1-1939999-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">as The Verge notes</a>, this feature has actually been in various Windows 11 beta and dev builds for over two years. The latest version is being added to Windows Insider builds in the Canary and Dev channels starting with 11.2304.17.0, which means it&rsquo;s almost certain to hit the release version of Windows 11 sometime in the near future. In addition to semi-final Dark Mode support, the updated Paint includes a new zoom tool with a granular slider and a few compatibility tweaks for better accessibility, in line with the rest of Windows. </p>



<p>To quote my editor Brad, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be so irritated if this doesn&rsquo;t come to Windows 10.&rdquo; I regret to inform you, and him, that there&rsquo;s no indication that this updated version of Paint is arriving in Windows 10 any time soon. Might I interest you in <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/551303/5-free-alternatives-to-photoshop-for-windows.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Paint.NET</a>, which has supported dark mode for years? </p>

<p>Nothing infuriates me quite like an ill fitting gaming headset. If it causes an ear ache in less than 45 minutes, I&rsquo;ll refuse to wear it ever again. If you&rsquo;re equally picky about your gaming headsets, we&rsquo;ve got a solid deal for you today. Woot, Amazon&rsquo;s discount site, is selling the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://electronics.woot.com/offers/sennheiser-game-zero-headset-black&amp;xcust=2-2-1939958-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Sennheiser Game Zero Headset for just $49.99</a>. That&rsquo;s 50 percent off of the original $99.99 price. Talk about a good deal, yeah? This accessory features XXL leatherette memory foam ear cups and a lightweight design, which means it should be comfortable to wear for long periods of time. Huzzah!</p>



<p>In addition to the comfortable ear cups, the headset also boasts crystal clear conversations thanks to the noise-canceling microphone. It has an open acoustic design, which means it allows some outside noise to bleed in. This is nice if you&rsquo;re the kind of person that prefers more natural noise to the isolated or dead-sounding noise of closed headphones. There&rsquo;s also a volume wheel on the right ear cup for quick adjustments and the collapsible design makes it super portable. Plus, it even comes with a hard carry case. </p>



<p>This is a great deal, and Sennheiser is renowned for its audio quality. You definitely don&rsquo;t want to miss out on this one.</p>

<p>The Mozilla Foundation will soon no longer support users of Windows 7, 8, 8.1 and macOS 10.12, 10.13 and 10.14 with updates for the popular Firefox browser. For a short time, an ESR (Extended Support Release) or LTS (Long-term Support) version will be available for these users before support finally ends in 2024. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.mozilla.org/de/kb/firefox-users-macos-1012-1013-1014-moving-to-extended-support&amp;xcust=2-2-1940069-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mozilla announced</a> the information in <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.mozilla.org/de/kb/firefox-users-macos-1012-1013-1014-moving-to-extended-support&amp;xcust=2-2-1940069-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">its own support blog.</a></p>

<p>The last supported version for the affected operating systems will be Firefox version 115, which is planned for the beginning of July 2023. The developers explain that Microsoft already <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1448683/windows-8-1-support-ends-january-10-secure-your-pc.html">ended support for Windows 7, 8 and 8.1 in January</a> and thus no more security updates will follow&mdash;even though there are known exploits. The Mozilla Foundation classifies the use of these operating systems as dangerous anyway.</p>



<p>The situation is similar for the three versions of macOS. The Mozilla Foundation wants to guarantee support for Firefox ESR 115 until September 2024, when Mozilla will automatically install the ESR version on the affected operating systems. Affected Windows users will not be able to switch to other well-known browsers: Microsoft Edge as well as Google Chrome ended support for Windows 7 and 8 long ago.</p>

## Bad firmware updates are teaching PC users the wrong habits

<p>Trust is everything. I&rsquo;m not an IT expert, but I have spent decades fielding questions and tending to devices belonging to friends and family. They know I&rsquo;m going to look out for their best interests.</p>



<p>But sometimes when I&rsquo;m called to action, I discover my nearest and dearest have been making decisions that can harm them. For example&mdash;not installing security patches or other firmware updates. And it&rsquo;s because their suspicion of a company outweighs their belief in me.</p>



<p>I can&rsquo;t always talk them out of the behavior, either. That&rsquo;s especially the case when the situation is like that with HP printers. Earlier this year, HP doubled down on its so-called &ldquo;dynamic security&rdquo; policy, issuing firmware updates for its printers that blocked the use of third-party ink. Instead of warnings about supposed bootleg ink, the printer just won&rsquo;t work.</p>



<p>Understandably, people were put out (including a couple of people I know) about these new draconian measures. They were even more infuriated when they realized that the only thing being protected is HP&rsquo;s bottom line.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="HP printer product page on hp.com" class="wp-image-1933406" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hp-printer-lineup.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>HP has taken to locking down its inkjet printers if you use third-party ink.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<p>&ldquo;The purpose of dynamic security feature is to protect HP&rsquo;s innovations and intellectual property, maintain the integrity of our printing systems, ensure the best customer printing experience, and protect customers from counterfeit and third-party ink cartridges that do not contain an original HP security chip and infringe HP&rsquo;s intellectual property,&rdquo; is how HP explains dynamic security on <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.hp.com/hr-en/product/hp-officejet-pro-6830-e-all-in-one-printerserie/5390307/document/c05308850&amp;xcust=2-2-1933400-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">one of its official support pages</a>.</p>



<p>Adding insult to injury was <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1925926/an-hp-firmware-update-is-bricking-printers-and-theres-no-fix-yet.html">HP then bricking some of its printers</a> with additional firmware updates, with no fix yet in sight.</p>



<p>Not all HP printers are affected by dynamic security&mdash;as my colleague Mark Hachman details, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1656073/these-hp-printers-can-be-upgraded-to-allow-third-party-printer-ink.html">you can reverse this behavior for select models.</a> But it adds yet another item to a to-do list, and for most people, figuring out if your printer qualifies for the workaround is an unwanted headache. Far easier to just ignore the update (if you can catch it before it rolls out), and if you can&rsquo;t, aggressively disabling future updates and even blocking your printers and other devices from online access in frustrated response.</p>



<p>I&rsquo;ve seen this happen from the sidelines. It makes me bite my nails in anxiety, because I get where this reaction comes from. But then I have to untangle and explain to them why they&rsquo;re stuck with a bug, missing features, or worst of all, exposed to a security vulnerability.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Brother HL-L2300D laser printer" class="wp-image-1933410" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/HLL2300D_left.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>I don&rsquo;t own this Brother HL-L2300D laser printer, but models like it exist that can take third-party cartridges. Tank printers are a way to evade third-party ink lockouts, too. </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brother</p></div>



<p>If you want to be trusted, you have to be trustworthy, and when companies like HP poison the well with anti-consumer restrictions, it teaches people to regard firmware updates with suspicion (or in the case of that one friend of mine, open hostility). It&rsquo;s self-defeating behavior, because eroding that relationship with customers mean they won&rsquo;t apply updates that keep products working optimally. (Cue an increase in angry customer service calls, forum comments, and social media posts.) Meanwhile, folks in the informal support trenches have to buy hair dye at faster rate.</p>



<p>Or they just do what I&rsquo;ve ended up doing&mdash;recommending alternative products. I myself bought a laser printer awhile back, and all I have to do is buy a third-party toner replacement. I drop new cartridge in, see that it works, and go about my life again. I tell my friends and family about this experience, too. It&rsquo;s a reminder they can take their business elsewhere&mdash;no need to change their security habits.</p>

## The War on Cables is the hottest desktop PC trend of 2023

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>Internal cable management is the most frustrating part of building a desktop PC. Wait, that&rsquo;s not right &mdash; the most frustrating part is making sure all your parts are compatible. Okay, that&rsquo;s not right either &mdash; the even more frustrating part is how expensive all those parts are. But cable management is definitely top five, especially if you like to frequently tinker with your setup. There&rsquo;s an emerging trend for PC hardware this year, and the PCWorld editorial staff has <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKCuEdJ93I&amp;xcust=2-2-1937700-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">christened it the War on Cables</a>. </p>



<p>PC hardware manufacturers are coming up with ever more elaborate tricks to keep your desktop enclosure nice and tidy, eliminating power and data cables whenever possible, and when not, tucking them all behind the motherboard so the main chamber looks like a minimalist office lobby. (I guess that would make the CPU cooler the massive reception desk?) Which you can leave bare, or fill up with nerdy stuff to show off through your case&rsquo;s big window. </p>



<p>I suspect this trend really got started years ago, when motherboards started coming with M.2 slots. When system builders could stick primary storage right on the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1520957/best-gaming-motherboards-picks-for-intel-and-amd.html">motherboard</a> and get rid of both power <em>and </em>data cables for SATA, it started an itch. That itch is now being scratched, and we&rsquo;re seeing it in new design tweaks for motherboards, fans and liquid coolers, lighting, enclosures, and even graphics cards. </p>

<h2 id="giving-props-to-gigabyte">Giving props to Gigabyte </h2>



<p>For a more recent and applicable starting point, we look to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/705375/take-a-closer-look-at-gigabytes-wire-free-project-stealth-motherboard.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Gigabyte&rsquo;s Project Stealth</a>, which goes back to 2022. The idea is simple: Take all the cable connections on the motherboard, for the power supply, fans, the case&rsquo;s front panel power switch, USB, and audio, and even SATA ports, and stick them to the back of the board instead of the front. This requires a bit of a redesign of the case itself, in order to plug everything in the rear. A slightly customized GPU rounds out the package, with the power connections facing the bottom of the graphics card instead of the top or side. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Done correctly, every cable in the system can be run through the back of the board, with the notable exception of whatever you&rsquo;re using to cool your CPU. You can actually buy Gigabyte&rsquo;s Project Stealth <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B5VX3JBJ/&amp;xcust=2-2-1937700-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">as a pre-built package right now on Amazon</a>, though it&rsquo;s a bit pricey for just a case, a motherboard, and a last-gen graphics card, and the board&rsquo;s chipset is from 2021. A new &ldquo;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.gigabyte.com/us/DIY-KIT/STEALTH-500#kf&amp;xcust=2-2-1937700-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Stealth 500</a>&rdquo; kit was announced at CES this year, though it appears to be using most of the same specs, just with a new case design and some included fans. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Gigabyte Project Stealth motherboard" class="wp-image-1938958" height="1115" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/project-stealth-motherboard-and-gpu.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Gigabyte</p></div>



<p>That&rsquo;s okay. Gigabyte isn&rsquo;t the only company on this train: New motherboard designs from <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.hardwaretimes.com/this-asus-motherboard-has-power-connectors-on-the-back-for-better-cable-management/&amp;xcust=2-2-1937700-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Asus</a>, Maxsun, and MSI are following the trend. The latter has its own &ldquo;Project&rdquo; moniker for this new design language, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1935712/msis-project-zero-continues-the-war-on-motherboard-cables.html">Project Zero</a>. Once again, you need a compatible motherboard and case to make it all work &mdash; MSI&rsquo;s initial version is in the slightly smaller MicroATX version, though standard ATX is coming. MSI says it&rsquo;s willing to make cases and boards that are compatible with other manufacturers, cementing the hope that this could become an industry-wide trend. </p>



<h2 id="other-components-follow-along">Other components follow along </h2>



<p>The case and the motherboard are the biggest pieces of this puzzle, but other components are being redesigned with a clean interior in mind as well. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1499073/corsairs-funky-new-power-supply-shorts-diy-pc-build-problems.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Corsair&rsquo;s RMx Shift power supply line</a> is notable, as it literally rotates the conventional position of the power supply by 90 degrees. That puts all the modular cable connections on the side of the PSU, facing the same side of the case as the rear of the motherboard. Again, combined with rear-facing headers on a board, that means every single power supply cable (with the possible exception of your graphics card and any non-M.2 storage) can be handled on the backside of the case, nothing in the front chamber. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Corsair RMx Shift power supply" class="wp-image-1938956" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CorsairRMxShift1-1.webp?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Corsair</p></div>



<p>Let&rsquo;s get back to Asus, which has already committed to making at least one motherboard with rear-facing connections. The graphics card has been a sticking point in all of this, especially since it&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;ll probably replace more often than your processor or motherboard. Asus has fixed that with the GPU-motherboard combo it&rsquo;s showing off at Computex. In this iteration there&rsquo;s no cable going to the graphics card at all, because the custom RTX 4070 card plugs into a custom header just to the side of the PCIe port. The power cable is technically still there, hiding the new 12VHPWR standard on the back of the motherboard and transferring all 600 watts to the card via the less-obtrusive port.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>This solution still requires both your motherboard and graphics card to match, which is probably why it appeals to Asus, maker and seller of both components. But there&rsquo;s no denying that it&rsquo;s the sleekest way to do this we&rsquo;ve seen thus far. If you&rsquo;re too young to remember Windows Millenium Edition, you might not remember the days when graphics cards didn&rsquo;t require dedicated power rails. But trust me, it made internal cable management a lot easier. Sadly there&rsquo;s no indication of whether or not this idea will make it to retail. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Corsair icue Link system GIF" class="wp-image-1935390" height="303" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/corsair-icue-link.gif" width="552" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Corsair</p></div>



<p>One system that <em>is </em>coming to an electronics store near you (if there are any electronics stores near you, anyway, it&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;re still selling Windows ME) is <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1939045/hands-on-with-icue-link-corsairs-one-cable-to-rule-them-all.html">Corsair&rsquo;s new iCue Link</a>. This &ldquo;ecosystem&rdquo; of cooling and lighting accessories uses a custom hub and wiring system to let you daisy chain any number of fans, AIO heads and radiators, and even coolant reservoirs along the same cable for power and data. Ideally implemented &mdash; with Corsair&rsquo;s proprietary and probably expensive gear, natch &mdash; you can string every cooling and lighting element inside a PC case along just one power and data cable. The way fans connect in arrays, like little LEGO blocks, is especially impressive.</p>



<h2 id="when-will-the-revolution-arrive">When will the revolution arrive? </h2>



<p>So when can you get all this wonderful tech for your next desktop build? Hard to say. Corsair&rsquo;s new power supplies are already out, and the iCue Link is scheduled for release within a month or two. The rest of the products shown off at Computex will be arriving in the latter half of 2023 or early 2024, <em>if</em> they progress to retail availability, given their project/prototype status. </p>



<p>I suspect that we&rsquo;ll see this trend evolve more slowly than some would like. Something akin to the shift to tool-free enclosure designs would be my guess. Eventually a super-clean, cable-free primary chamber will be the standard instead of the exception, but it&rsquo;ll take a few years for everyone to catch up. At which point cases will have even more big plastic and glass windows, the better to show off the Funko Pops and LEGO sets you can now perch on your GPU &mdash; contain your excitement, /r/Battlestations posters. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI Project Zero: The War on Cables" class="wp-image-1938971" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/gigabyte-project-zero-header-image.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Patrick Murray/Foundry</p></div>



<p>Will it actually make a difference for performance? Probably not. A big, open chamber looks good through plexiglass, but as far as actual cooling performance it&rsquo;s more important to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394965/how-to-set-up-your-pcs-fans-for-maximum-system-cooling.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">have your fans and radiators properly placed</a> and keep everything dust-free. And it&rsquo;s worth noting that a lot of these innovations probably won&rsquo;t make it to small form factor designs, like the gorgeous new <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.fractal-design.com/products/cases/terra/terra/terra-jade/&amp;xcust=2-2-1937700-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Fractal Design Terra</a>. Those cases are pulling every engineering trick they can just to cram components together without catching fire, they can&rsquo;t spare any thought for aesthetic cable management. </p>



<p>And this trend is, at its core, aesthetic. But I for one appreciate a clean interior build a lot more than a techno rave&rsquo;s worth of RGB LED lights, or <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/563438/you-dont-need-a-tiny-monitor-for-your-ram-but-thermaltake-will-sell-you-one-anyway.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">extraneous screens</a> strapped to every internal component. (Which, now that I think of it, will only get more numerous without cables in the way.) Now if only they can figure out a way to get an all-in-one liquid cooling setup to be &ldquo;cable free,&rdquo; we can have some real fun. </p>

You heard it was gorgeous, and highly demanding on even the mightiest hardware.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Your senses struggle to take in everything you&rsquo;re witnessing. Your eyeballs almost melt from the searing 1,000 nits brightness of the mini-LED screen. They&rsquo;re then soothed by the gorgeous crispy 4K and massaged by the punchy colors. HDR accentuates every little detail of these path traced lights. The game&rsquo;s neon signs are so vibrant that they&rsquo;re almost etched into your retina! Dark corners of the game look clear and detailed, with satisfyingly deep blacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Something else draws your attention: Is it raining outside? No&mdash;it&rsquo;s not. You realize the enveloping surround effects of the speakers have made the sound wrap around you, like a warm blanket. You quickly become part of the world you&rsquo;re gaming in, and the 4K performance is perfectly smooth. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1662185/what-is-dlss-3-nvidia-geforce-rtx-ai-feature-explained.html">Nvidia&rsquo;s DLSS 3 technology</a> makes even the most stubborn frames subject to focus on serving you a great gaming experience.</p>



<p>Fully immersed, you miss your train&rsquo;s stop home. No problem&mdash;you unplug your <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1801763/razer-blade-16-review.html">Razer Blade 16 laptop</a> from the outlet and slip it into your bookbag. At a smidgen over five pounds, you have no trouble walking the rest of the way home.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My friends, I have been a desktop enthusiast gamer for over 20 years. I put aside my desktop rig for the last several months and have been engrossing myself in the modern <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407493/best-gaming-laptops.html">gaming laptop experience</a>, and I was blown away by modern offerings like the Razer Blade 16 and its powerful GeForce RTX 4090. They&rsquo;re surprisingly versatile, with some even allowing overclocking and tuning!</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s been a surprisingly great time&mdash;but not all roses.</p>



<p>After several weeks of testing, I wanted to share the shocking highs I&rsquo;ve experienced when choosing to game on a powerful laptop, as well as compromises you should be aware of. It&rsquo;s certainly not for everyone, but there&rsquo;s magic to behold for those who wander further.</p>

<h2 id="the-bad-news">The bad news</h2>



<p>Let&rsquo;s get the drawbacks out in the open first, so we can have a frank and open discussion. I want to focus on the gaming experience, but there some harsh realities that mobile gamers will face:&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Price</strong></h3>



<p>Fire-breathing laptops like the Razer Blade 16 are high-end, premium products. Packing specs such as Intel&rsquo;s Core i9-13950HX CPU and Nvidia&rsquo;s ferocious GeForce RTX 4090 graphics, you&rsquo;ll pay a pretty penny. While you can find RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 laptops in the low to mid $2,000 range, some models will easily cost more than $4,000. The Razer Blade 16 costs $4,299. (That said, if you don&rsquo;t need the utmost performance, there are <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/630093/best-gaming-laptops-under-1000.html">solid 1080p gaming laptops available under $1,000</a>.)</p>

<p>Yes, building your own gaming desktop will always provide more raw value than gaming laptops. You can build your own desktop setup for an even higher tier gaming experience, for cheaper. Some people prefer (or even absolutely <em>need</em>) a mobile solution, however. There are many valid use cases to justify the extra expense.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remember, you&rsquo;re getting some insane performance that can slip into your backpack and sip power compared to energy-hungry desktops.</p>



<h3><strong>Cooling and battery life</strong></h3>



<p>That said, gaming laptops run hot. Fans start spinning the second you start gaming, and there&rsquo;s a lot of cooling variation between gaming laptops. The aluminum Razer Blade 16 feels warm to the touch, for example, but its fans mostly deliver an agreeable tone and loudness.&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll want to raise the laptop with a simple stand for better performance.</p>



<p>The battery life of gaming laptops also disappoint compared to simpler productivity notebooks. You can game for maybe an hour away from an outlet, but you&rsquo;ll want to be plugged in while playing the majority of the time. While the Razer Blade 16 offers surprisingly good battery life outside of gaming&mdash;hitting 7 hours in PCWorld&rsquo;s video battery rundown test thanks to Nvidia&rsquo;s Advanced Optimus technology, which switches to integrated graphics for light loads&mdash;this breed of machine really does need plugged-in power to maximize performance.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Redfall HDR" class="wp-image-1932019" height="1200" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_5947.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1188" width="1188" /><figcaption><p>Redfall HDR and Light effects Look great on the Razer Blade 16 Mini-LED. The keyboard RGB isn&rsquo;t bad either!&nbsp;</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<h3><strong>Issues to note</strong></h3>



<p>Nvidia drivers have been hit-or-miss for some RTX 40 series notebooks. There is a known issue where some laptops with drivers newer than 528.29 will have random black screens or lockups. When it works, it&rsquo;s smooth&mdash;but when you run into these issues, it can be a poor experience. I have not experienced this on the Razer Blade 16, but my <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-GeForce-i9-13980HX-Windows-G634JZ-XS96/dp/B0BS8HV64F?th=1&amp;xcust=2-2-1932012-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Asus ROG Strix Scar 16</a> still locks up more than normal, so your mileage may vary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I previously encountered various issues such as mini-LED screen flicker and a quirky touchpad on the Razer Blade 16, but those were rapidly resolved with firmware updates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now onto the good stuff!</p>

<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Redfall" class="wp-image-1932020" height="707" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_5981-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Redfall: Despite what the reviews say, the lighting still looks impressive on a mini-LED HDR screen.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>The gaming experience is what you see, hear, and feel when using a system. After trying various RTX 40-series laptops this generation, the Razer Blade 16 was the one that consistently made me feel the most immersed in the experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For context, my desktop system runs an <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html">RTX 4090 GPU</a> paired with an LG 42-inch 4K OLED&mdash;so any laptop has stiff competition. I am in no way suggesting the desktop experience is not superior, I am merely suggesting that you can have just as good as an experience with a great laptop.</p>



<p>Let&rsquo;s discuss the details of what makes the gaming experience on this Razer Blade 16. First, I&rsquo;ll describe some specific games, and then break down each element of the components that make the whole thing work.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Dead Space Remake and Callisto Protocol</strong></h3>



<p>These games are both very dark and atmospheric, with great lighting effects. The Razer Blade 16&rsquo;s mini-LED screen was a revelation here. Deep, dark black levels contrasted with the most minute details when lighting effects pop off the screen with HDR.&nbsp;After experiencing the mini-led screen, even a high quality IPS display such as the 500 nit Razer Blade 18 panel felt dull and undefined, especially in very dark scenes.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Razer Blade 16 display" class="wp-image-1801800" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Razer-Blade-16-display.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The display options for the Razer Blade 16&rsquo;s killer mini-LED dual-mode screen.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<p>Overall performance was good, even at 4K with the help of DLSS in <em>Dead Space Remake</em>, and FSR in <em>Callisto Protocol</em>. These are not the smoothest of games, with some frame rate drops evident at times&mdash;but that&rsquo;s more on the game optimization side than any issue with the hardware.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Hogwarts Legacy, Horizon Zero Dawn</strong></h3>



<p>Once again, vibrant colors absolutely dominate the experience here. While these games are typically better lit, even the darker scenes look stunning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Performance is once again great in both titles, especially with DLSS 3 in <em>Hogwarts</em>, which offers a great gaming experience over 60 FPS even at 4K resolution with ray tracing. That&rsquo;s wild for a gaming laptop, especially in such a demanding game. Sound is also crisp and crunchy in both titles, with dialog being super clear. It&rsquo;s common to hear the voices sound like they&rsquo;re really in your room, with great separation and surround effects.&nbsp;Razer nailed the Blade 16&rsquo;s audio</p>



<h3><strong>Jedi: Survivor</strong></h3>



<p>How about brand new, deeply unoptimized games like <em>Jedi Survivor</em>? The Razer Blade 16 runs them pretty well thanks to its raw brute force power! 4K with ray tracing will get you some sub-60fps performance, but it&rsquo;s close enough that it remains a smooth experience with AMD&rsquo;s FSR feature active. I dropped it down to 1080p, and it looked 99 percent as good with significantly higher FPS.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Maingear Laptop" class="wp-image-1932021" height="816" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-01-19-at-11.26.14-AM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Gaming trifecta: Last gen maingear laptop, Steam Deck, and a big ol&rsquo; screen.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>The sound is stellar, with surround effects throwing voices around and effects. The real star of the show is once again the mini-LED screen, with beautiful colors, crisp details, contrast, and brilliant HDR. The light saber almost pops out of the screen!</p>



<h2 id="what-makes-the-razer-blade-16-special">What makes the Razer Blade 16 special</h2>



<h3><strong>The mini-LED screen</strong></h3>



<p>The Razer Blade 16&rsquo;s 1000 nit mini-LED screen means it&rsquo;s super bright, and better yet, colors and contrast look significantly better than other traditional IPS screens. </p>



<p>HDR can be tricky to properly implement and calibrate for certain games, but I found the Razer Blade 16&rsquo;s screen well-tuned out of the box and it absolutely makes a tremendous difference in visuals.&nbsp; This means that games such as <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, and even the new <em>Jedi: Survivor</em> absolutely pop out of the screen. It&rsquo;s not only the brightness. Lighting elements take on new life with HDR, and ray tracing is especially beautiful.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is particularly true on the Razer Blade 16 screen. The mini-LED screens on the RTX 4090 Asus Scar 16 and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1561127/msi-titan-gt77-hx-13v-review.html">MSI Titan GT77</a> are great too, but don&rsquo;t offer quite the same color, contrast, and <em>life</em> that the Razer Blade 16 version exhibits. I have had these laptops side-by-side and compared the same game scenes with them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Furthermore, only the Blade 16 includes an unorthodox dual resolution display, meaning it can natively support 4K and 1080p with a simple restart in Razer Synapse.&nbsp;It looks good in 1080p, too. Want higher frame rate in demanding games? Switch it over, and just like magic you get better performance with the lower resolution. While I do think 1440p resolution is likely the sweet spot for laptops, Razer&rsquo;s unusual dual-mode display offers a compelling mix.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I find myself often leaving it in 4K, as the RTX 4090 in this laptop can power most games competently. 4K resolution on a 16 inch screen is not necessary by any means, but if we&rsquo;re talking the very fine details here, you can notice the increased sharpness if you really look.&nbsp;You can always plug in this laptop to a larger display if you&rsquo;d wish &ndash; but the mini-led display is so gorgeous that I always wanted to use it.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>The sounds</strong></h3>



<p>The Razer Blade 16 has <em>fantastic</em> speakers with THX surround sound capabilities. They&rsquo;re loud and offer great sound separation that makes you feel immersed within games. Some people may want to turn THX off, and you&rsquo;ll still get a very well-rounded sound even then.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Razer Blade 16 overview" class="wp-image-1801767" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Razer-Blade-16-overview.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<p>What makes the sound experience complete are the acoustic profiles of the two cooling fans. Some laptops are annoyingly loud, hitting well over 55 decibels. Not the Razer Blade 16.&nbsp;You can set the fans to maximum speed if desired, but I recommend just leaving it on auto.&nbsp;Those powerful speakers easily overtake the fans, which are never abrasively loud.</p>



<p>Music sounded great, too. Gone are the days of tiny, poorly made laptop speakers. This small laptop has some mighty fine sound, second only to its bigger brother, the Razer Blade 18.</p>



<h3><strong>Performance</strong></h3>



<p>The Razer Blade 16 leaves the vast majority of even desktop gaming machines in the dust, full stop.</p>



<p>The RTX 4090 in this laptop is not the equivalent of the desktop RTX 4090&mdash;far from it. Still, even with 16GB of VRAM and some insanely powerful performance, it&rsquo;s also only sipping 175 watts compared to the 450 watts of the desktop GPU. That&rsquo;s darn impressive.&nbsp;Coupled with DLSS 3 (in supported games), the Razer Blade 16 can absolutely trounce games even at 4K. I found that I can run every setting on ultra, maxed out, including ray tracing, and still have great performance across the board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How about the rest of the hardware? You get a 2TB internal SSD and the option to add more. RAM is generous at 32GB of 5600mhz DDR5, which can be further upgraded to 64GB at the expense of some speed.&nbsp;While you aren&rsquo;t able to upgrade the CPU or GPU like in a desktop, Razer opened up access to CPU overclocking. There is an entire community of enthusiasts who have achieved insanely high scores by this unlocked CPU, even surpassing many desktop chips.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While prices reach stratospheric highs for premium gaming laptops, the experience they provide has also reached a new zenith, powered by potent hardware such as the RTX 4090 and Intel&rsquo;s 13th-gen HX chips. In combination with the gorgeous mini-LED screens just starting to appear in notebooks, modern gaming laptops can offer terrific gaming experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1801763/razer-blade-16-review.html">Razer Blade 16</a> particularly excels at this task. It&rsquo;s a very well-rounded package that brings it together masterfully.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Should you give up your desktop for a gaming laptop? Not necessarily&mdash;but it&rsquo;s not such a crazy idea anymore. With such visceral gaming experiences possible on these refined and powerful laptops, it may even be the preference for some. I&rsquo;ve certainly been converted into a believer.</p>
