## Disney May Remove More Movies And Shows From Disney Plus Or Hulu Soon

<p>Even just a few years ago, many of us naively believed that streaming services would act as constantly-growing libraries of content that we could return to whenever to watch shows at will. Then, last year, Warner Bros. Discovery fired the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/26-hbo-max-original-shows-and-movies-pulled-from-the-service/2900-4288/">first big shot</a> in The Great Write-Down. Disney <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-announces-removal-of-multiple-titles-from-streaming-services/1100-6514361/">followed suit last month</a> and now says there's more to come, <a href="https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/disney-1-5-billion-content-write-off-charge-streaming-1235631877/">Variety</a> reports.</p><p>Following the removal of shows and movies like Willow, Y: The Last Man, Dollface, and the Mysterious Benedict Society, Disney is expected to incur a content impairment charge of $1.5 billion, meaning that the company can remove that much from its tax sheet. That's an impossible number to ignore--that's savings equivalent to a handful of Marvel movies. As a result, Disney is reportedly continuing to review content on both Disney+ and Hulu, and "currently anticipates additional produced content will be removed from its DTC and other platforms, largely during the remainder of its third fiscal quarter." That will likely equate to about $400 million more in impairment charges related to produced content (primarily meaning scripted television and film).</p><p>Since the early days of Netflix creating streaming content for its platform, streaming services have been growing and growing their libraries. So many people have joined streaming services, though, that growth is slowing significantly; there just aren't as many <em>new </em>customers as there used to be. It's about retaining existing users and bringing back others that have switched to other services.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-may-remove-more-movies-and-shows-from-disney-plus-or-hulu-soon/1100-6514785/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>20 years ago, there was something undeniably exciting about scrounging up a few dollars, heading down to your local game store, and placing a preorder for the next entry in your favorite series. These days, however, we can't help but feel a bit more hesitant.

## Diablo 4 - Secret Of The Spring Side Quest And Emote Guide

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4</a> is full of side quests, and while many of them simply ask you to mow down the forces of Hell, some of them require a bit more thought. One of those is a side quest called "Secret of the Spring" which can be found just north of the first major <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-kyovashad-hub-city-guide/1100-6512473/">hub city Kyovashad</a>. This quest is started when you find a small note with a riddle on it. Here's how to complete it.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to complete the Secret of the Spring in Diablo 4</h2><figure style="width: 3840px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4147413-spring1.png"><img alt="The note can be found near the entrance to the Forsaken Quarry Dungeon." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4147413-spring1.png" /></a><figcaption>The note can be found near the entrance to the Forsaken Quarry Dungeon.</figcaption></figure><p><span>First, you will need to collect the riddle note that starts the quest off. This note can be found north of Kyovashad near the entrance to the Forsaken Quarry dungeon, marked on the map above by the red circle. The quickest path here is to leave the city via the east exit and stick to the end of the map heading north. Once you find the note, the quest will start marking a small area on the map further north from where the note was found.</span></p><figure style="width: 3840px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4147415-spring3.png"><img alt="The spring itself can be found just a bit north of where the note is picked up." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4147415-spring3.png" /></a><figcaption>The spring itself can be found just a bit north of where the note is picked up.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr">The note itself reads "Beacon of warmth in winter's embrace, patience rewarded by nature's own grace." Once you reach the location indicated on the map, you will find a small pool of water, which is the spring in the name of the quest. Like some other side quests in Diablo 4, you need to use a specific emote here. What might be confusing to some is that the "patience" noted in the riddle doesn't match anything in the default emote wheel.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-secret-of-the-spring-side-quest-and-emote-guide/1100-6514781/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The Rogue in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4</a> is one of the more complicated classes to play, largely due to a focus on applying buffs and debuffs in combat. Despite this, the Rogue can also have an incredibly high damage output against both single-target enemies and large groups, if you know how to build right. The Rogue can be built for Poison, Ice, or Shadow damage, as well as an emphasis on either single-target or multi-target attacks.</p><p dir="ltr">This build will cover which active abilities, passives, and upgrades you should grab to maximize each build's potential.</p><div><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a href="https://www.gamespot.com">hide</a>]</span><ul class="collapse in" id="toc_list"><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com">Best rogue builds</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="Best_rogue_builds">Best rogue builds</h2><p dir="ltr">While you can tailor each Rogue build to have a better emphasis on large groups versus single-targets, the builds here will be set up to deal with both with ease. The main difference between the three builds is which Imbuement abilities they use, along with some minor changes to maximize those elements. In addition, there will be some notes on how you should play with each class, to maximize the passives and upgrades chosen below.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-best-rogue-builds-guide/1100-6514780/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Valve Notified Nintendo Of Dolphin Emulator Prior To Its Steam Removal

<p>Following the <a href="https://gamespot.com/articles/dolphin-emulator-team-nixes-steam-launch-after-nintendo-intervenes/1100-6514637/">recent cancellation and removal</a> of GameCube and Wii Dolphin Emulator from Steam, it seems Valve itself is to blame, at least partially. Valve reportedly notified Nintendo of the emulator's existence before Dolphin was blocked from being distributed on the platform.</p><p>This comes by way of a report from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/1/23745772/valve-nintendo-dolphin-emulator-steam-emails">The Verge</a>, which received confirmation from Valve itself. "Given Nintendo’s history of taking action against some emulators, we brought this to their attention proactively after the Dolphin team announced it was coming soon to Steam," a Valve spokesperson said.</p><p>Notably, Valve did not issue a standard DMCA takedown notice to the Dolphin team. "Nintendo of America asserts that your game content infringes on their IP," an email from Valve to the Dolphin team reads. "Due to the IP complaint, we have removed Dolphin Emulator from Steam until both parties notify us that the dispute is resolved."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-notified-nintendo-of-dolphin-emulator-prior-to-its-steam-removal/1100-6514779/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4</a> features an open-world version of Sanctuary, which features five different regions. The five regions are Fractured Peaks, Dry Steppes, Hawezar, Kehjistan, and Scosglen. As you advance through the Diablo 4 campaign you will find yourself exploring each of these regions, which all have their own Renown and reward track. Here's how to earn Renown and what you get for doing it.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to earn Renown</h2><p dir="ltr">There are six ways to earn renown in each region, each of which offers a different amount of renown points. <strong>Discovering new areas is 5 points, finding Altars of Lilith is 10 points, and activating Waypoints is 20 points.</strong> Exploration isn't the only way to increase your renown though. Completing <strong>side quests is worth 20 points, dungeons 30 points, and Strongholds 100 points</strong>. With the exceptions of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-all-stronghold-locations/1100-6514611/">Strongholds</a>--of which there are three in each region--the exact number of each activity varies from region to region, but the totals are listed in the renown menu. The Renown menu can be accessed via the map menu, which is also where you can claim your rewards for each tier you complete.</p><h2 dir="ltr">The region rewards</h2><figure style="width: 3840px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4147339-d4regionrewards.png"><img alt="While each region offers the same rewards, the number of each task varies." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4147339-d4regionrewards.png" /></a><figcaption>While each region offers the same rewards, the number of each task varies.</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr">Each region has five tiers of rewards, one reward of bonus XP and gold that is for the specific character you completed it with, and an account-wide reward for all of your characters on that server.

<p>While production on Disney+'s Andor series <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/1281644/andor-showrunner-tony-gilroy-pauses-all-work-wga-strike-lucasfilm-comment/">might be on pause</a> while the WGA strike commences, star Diego Luna and showrunner Tony Gilroy gave some input for Season 2, aiming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/andor-season-2-set-for-august-2024-release-on-disney-plus/1100-6513058/">for a 2024 release</a>. Cassian Andor (Luna) first debuted with 2016's Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, with the Disney+ series taking place before the movie and Season 2 ending right before the events of the start. We obviously know Andor's inevitable fate, but leading up to it has been an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/andor-review-the-spark-of-a-revolution/1900-6417960/">incredible journey thus far</a>. </p><p>So while we'll have to wait on those details, Luna and Gilroy talked to EW's <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/dagobah-dispatch-an-ew-star-wars-podcast/id1487489835">Dagobah Dispatch podcast</a> during this year's Star Wars Celebration over the Spring, and before the strike. </p><p>"The beauty of this show is that even though sometimes you know what's going to happen, it hits you as though you're learning it for the first time," Luna said. "You are witnessing this from the inside, from the personal perspective. You get to live it with the characters, or through the characters. Therefore, it hits you differently. It's not about the events, necessarily, but about the choices made and the risks these characters are taking. It's because you know them that you care like you didn't care before."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diego-luna-and-tony-gilroy-discuss-the-importance-of-finishing-andors-story/1100-6514778/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## HyperX Cloud III Gaming Headset Review - Built Different
 - [https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hyperx-cloud-iii-gaming-headset-review-built-different/1100-6514777/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hyperx-cloud-iii-gaming-headset-review-built-different/1100-6514777/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f)

<p dir="ltr">Having seen new headsets come out at a fairly brisk pace over the years, it'd be fair to wonder what the fuss is about from iteration to iteration when looking at a new option like the HyperX Cloud III. It's usually a handful of minor improvements between each model, and sometimes that's enough for companies to justify a refresh of tried-and-true products (as was the case when I <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/logitech-g-pro-x-2-wireless-gaming-headset-review-top-tier-top-dollar/1100-6514485/">reviewed the Logitech G Pro X 2 wireless gaming headset</a> recently). Although it's been about eight years since its predecessor came out, that's sort of where the HyperX Cloud III lands, the just-released follow-up to the long-revered Cloud II. It's a testament to how well-designed the older headset was, but the refinements make this revision a worthy successor and effectively one of the best wired headsets available.</p><p dir="ltr">Changes such as the slightly plushier cushions, angular earcups, and better balanced audio are welcome. However, I found the most notable upgrade to be in the impressive microphone quality, which is top-notch, especially for a headset. And the combination of flexibility, durability, and minimal clamp force remain key features to make the Cloud III impressively designed from a comfort and ergonomic standpoint. It's not flashy, and it's not going to blow you away with an array of features or customizability, but at a standard retail price of $100 USD, you get a superb headset--nothing more, nothing less.</p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://shop-links.co/1810042809470596857?u1=subid_value">See at Best Buy</a> </div><h2 dir="ltr">Packaging and Features</h2><p dir="ltr">The HyperX Cloud III comes with the headset (of course), the detachable microphone, a 3.5mm auxiliary input to USB-C cable, and a USB-C to USB type-A adapter. The headset itself has the 3.5mm audio cable attached to it and measures about 4 feet, which isn't that long. If you're using this in a PC gaming situation, though, the aux-to-USB cable also acts as an extension cord. The Cloud III still uses 53mm drivers but are now set at an angle which is said to give a more accurate audio experience, and as we'll get into later, they're enough to pack a punch.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hyperx-cloud-iii-gaming-headset-review-built-different/1100-6514777/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Between sessions of Deep Dive and Salvage, Destiny 2 has settled into its regular groove at the start of Season of the Deep. A new story mission is available after the weekly reset, players are discovering lethal new exploits with seasonal weapons, and of course, Xur is back for another weekend of trading. If you've got the Legendary Shards, then Xur has the Exotic gear that you're looking for. Here's where you can find Xur this week and what the Agent of the Nine has for sale.</p><p>This week you can find Xur in <strong>the EDZ</strong>, in the <strong>Winding Cove</strong> area. For his weapon, Xur is offering <strong>Sweet</strong> <strong>Business</strong>. Hunters can pick up <strong>Aeon Swift </strong>gauntlets; Titans can grab the <strong>Lion</strong> <strong>Rampant</strong> leg armor; and for Warlocks, Xur has the <strong>Vesper</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>Radius</strong> armor.</p><h2>Xur Location</h2><figure style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4147258-xuredz.jpg"><img alt="Xur's location in the EDZ." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4147258-xuredz.jpg" /></a><figcaption>Xur's location in the EDZ.</figcaption></figure><p>Spawn in at the Winding Cove transmat zone, then hop on your sparrow and go north.

<p>After a decade-plus away, EA Sports is back in the business of baseball games on console. The lighthearted, arcade-style Super Mega Baseball 4, from EA's Metalhead Software, is out now on console and PC.</p><p>Fans have been waiting a while, as the COVID-delayed Super Mega Baseball 3 was released back in 2020. Metalhead was acquired by EA in 2021, and some feared that the next release in the series might add some of EA's business practices, namely microtransactions.</p><div>          </div><p>These fears were unfounded, as Super Mega Baseball 4 has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mega-baseball-4-will-not-have-microtransactions-but-some-paid-dlc/1100-6513678/">no microtransactions</a> (though people can spend real money to buy the stadiums that come with the game's premium editions). Super Mega Baseball 4 costs $50, which is $5 more than Super Mega Baseball 3's launch price in 2020.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-first-baseball-game-for-console-in-10-plus-years-is-out-now-and-it-has-no-microtransactions/1100-6514772/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><strong>Warning: This article contains spoilers about some minor and unimportant Easter eggs in Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. </strong></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-review/1900-6418074/">Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse</a> is a wild experience all the way through, but its wildest part has to be the time we spend at the headquarters of the cross-dimensional Spider-Society. During these scenes we encounter what feels like every ridiculous idea for a Spider-Person that Marvel has ever come up with. It's delightful.</p><p>But the Spider-Society is hiding a bunch of other Easter eggs, too. In their efforts at policing the multiverse, the various Spider-Folk have captured a bunch of baddies who were in the wrong dimension. They hold them in a little jail at the Spider-Society until they can send them back to where they belong.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-has-easter-eggs-for-upcoming-ps5-spidey-game/1100-6514763/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>A previously unobtainable Achievement in farming game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/homestead-arcana/">Homestead Arcana</a> has been removed. The Achievement, "You Can't Be Too Prepared," was seemingly deleted by Microsoft after it was found to be unobtainable.</p><p>This, as discovered by Achievement website <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n53962/homestead-aracana-unobtainable-xbox-achievement">TrueAchievements</a>, is a rare occurrence, as Microsoft seldomly ever deletes Achievements outright. The "You Can't Be Too Prepared" Achievement required players to craft every item in the game, but the Green Ankle Boots weren't tracking, locking players out of earning the Achievement. For a time, it was unclear if the Achievement would get fixed.</p><div>          </div><p>Now, the 100 Gamerscore from "You Can't Be Too Prepared" has been allocated to other Achievements to retain the game's overall 1,000 Gamerscore total.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/impossible-xbox-achievement-removed-seemingly-by-microsoft/1100-6514771/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick has revealed that his company nearly made a move to buy Time Warner and turn its franchises into video games. This was years ago, in 2018, when AT&amp;T was attempting to buy Time Warner for $85.4 billion.</p><p>While the deal was held up in legal proceedings, Kotick told <a href="https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/activision-blizzard-ceo-addresses-toxic-workforce-claims-microsoft-deal-1235628361/">Variety</a> that Activision Blizzard raised "all the capital" and was in a place to make a bid if things fell apart with AT&amp;T.</p><p>"We'd take their IP and turn it into games. They'd take our IP and turn it into film and television, and we'd have an extraordinary company," he said.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-blizzard-was-prepared-to-buy-lego-batman-and-harry-potter-company-time-warner/1100-6514770/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Diablo 4 Is Making Error 37 Look Like A Distant Bad Memory With Its Smooth Start

<p>Diablo 4 is now officially <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-release-time-and-how-to-play-at-launch/1100-6513034/">available in early access</a> for players who <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/diablo-4-preorder-guide/2900-4535/">preordered its special editions</a>, and as they've discovered, the game has launched in a remarkably smooth state. Compared to the infamously rough "Error 37" days that were a lowlight of Diablo 3's launch back in May 2012, it's been mostly smooth sailing for Diablo 4 so far.</p><p>Once players have their Battle.net accounts set up and are logged in, they're able to start up a session and hop straight into the demonic action. While there are reports of some PlayStation players running into licensing issues, for the most part, Diablo IV is off to a flying start in its current state and that <em>should</em> allay the fears of anyone who still remembers being able to play its predecessor for days at a time due to the infamous Error 37 bug. As spotted by <a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-iv-server-error-license-ps5-bugs-early-access-1850499686">Kotaku</a>, players online have been expressing just how surprised they are with Diablo IV's launch.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">Have to give credit where it's due.

## EA Racing Studio Hit With Significant Layoffs
 - [https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-racing-studio-hit-with-significant-layoffs/1100-6514768/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-racing-studio-hit-with-significant-layoffs/1100-6514768/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f)

<p dir="ltr">Layoffs are nothing new in the video game industry, but the past few months have been dire in that department. EA's Australian studio Firemonkeys is the latest impacted by large layoffs, with up to two-thirds of the developers' staff on the chopping block.</p><p dir="ltr">As reported by <a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2023/06/eas-firemonkeys-studio-hit-with-massive-layoffs/">Kotaku AU</a>, the Melbourne-based studio currently provides live services for three games: Real Racing 3, The Sims FreePlay, and Need for Speed: No Limits. An EA spokesperson <a href="https://twitter.com/dctrjack/status/1664093928365367297">told Kotaku AU</a> earlier this month that the publisher is "making some changes to the structure of Firemonkeys Studio, allowing teams there to focus on supporting live services for The Sims FreePlay."

<p>Pro <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/league-of-legends/">League of Legends</a> players in North America initiated a walk out earlier this week, with representative body the LCS Players Association announcing that the vote "overwhelmingly passed." Riot Games has now responded to the strike action with a statement that threatens to cancel the upcoming LCS summer season, leaving the region without a representative at 2023 Worlds.</p><p>The action started in protest to a rules change whereby Riot Games no longer requires teams competing in the top-level LCS league to also field a team for the developmental-level NACL league, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/league-of-legends-pro-players-vote-to-strike-over-riots-rule-changes/">PC Gamer reported</a>. A number of teams immediately cut their NACL rosters in response to the change, which according to the LCS Players Association, impacted at least 70 jobs including players, coaches, and managers.</p><p>The LCSPA voted to strike on May 28, after the association deemed <a href="https://lolesports.com/article/2023-nacl-summer-split-primer/blt6349f3157cad3908">Riot's new NACL plan</a> unsatisfactory for players.
