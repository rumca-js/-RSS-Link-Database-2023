But without understanding and respect a life support system for our planet could be trashed</p><p></p><p>The real payoff from the Apollo missions had nothing to do with the moon. The prize was travelling far enough out into space to look back properly at planet Earth. Those two unforgettable images \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/dec/22/behold-blue-plant-photograph-earthrise\">Earthrise</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/content/blue-marble-image-of-the-earth-from-apollo-17\">Blue Marble</a> \u2013 showed us our fragile and precious planet, defined by its blue. Since then, we\u2019ve talked proudly about our \u201cblue planet\u201d but without thinking any further about what that blue actually is. We talk about fish and whales, plastic and pollution \u2013 the things that are in the water \u2013 but not the water itself. The great ocean engine has just kept turning while we scurry about near its surface, only caring when its churning causes something dramatic that we can see \u2013 an algal bloom or a giant swarm of jellyfish.</p><p>More than 50 years after Apollo, the ocean is starting to get more attention, but a growing slice of the discussion is based on the assumption that it is there for us to use, a resource to be exploited, a great volume of \u201cnothing\u201d that human inventiveness is going to turn into \u201csomething\u201d. And this is incredibly dangerous. Unless humanity starts to see the ocean for what it really is \u2013 a critical part of our planetary life support system \u2013 we risk sleepwalking into destruction.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/04/why-we-need-to-respect-earths-last-great-wilderness-the-ocean\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/04/why-we-need-to-respect-earths-last-great-wilderness-the-ocean", "date_published": "2023-06-04 13:00:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Bon app\u00e9tit: savouring the gastronomic highs of Hauts-de-France", "description": "It\u2019s a short hop across the Channel to Hauts-de-France, which has just won European gastronomic region of the year<p>This stunning area of northern France where it borders Belgium is famous for its numerous cheeses.

But perfectionism is counter-productive and can result in soaring levels of stress. The answer, believes Professor Thomas Curran, is to go a little easier on yourself</p><p>About a decade ago, Thomas Curran, a psychology student, travelled to Australia to embark on a postdoctoral fellowship and was crushed with anxiety, exhaustion and panic attacks. Beyond making the round-the-world flight, he\u2019d really pushed himself hard to make it there. Curran is from Wellingborough, a town in the east Midlands, and grew up \u201cwithout much money\u201d. His mum used to work as a receptionist at the Hind Hotel, his dad was a construction worker who was famous locally (Curran tells me with a touch of pride) for riding the statue of a deer mounted above the hotel\u2019s entrance. As a teen, Curran thought he\u2019d go into construction, too, but spurred on by the New Labour education drive, he chose university. Now he was far beyond the expectations of his youth \u2013 and surely well on the road to success in academia \u2013 yet found himself in pieces: \u201ca failure\u201d.</p><p>With all going south Down Under, Curran returned to the UK. At a less prestigious institution, the pressure eased. He dropped his competitive streak and decided \u201cto stop trying to please other people\u201d. Able to let his mind wander, he began to look more forensically at perfectionism, a trait he recognised in himself and \u2013 until that point \u2013 had rather celebrated. After all, surely it was perfectionism that enabled him to meet the high standards he placed upon himself and rise from his working-class roots? And surely it was the same impulse that kicked him out of bed when he felt crushed by self-criticism, and pushed him through panic attacks to keep striving? \u201cI was genuinely of the belief that perfectionism was the one thing that was holding me up when everything around me was collapsing,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it was actually perfectionism that was creating those problems.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/04/the-rise-of-perfectionism-and-the-harm-its-doing-us-all\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/04/the-rise-of-perfectionism-and-the-harm-its-doing-us-all", "date_published": "2023-06-04 13:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "\u2018I feel so helpless\u2019: Indians search for missing family at train crash site", "description": "<p>Relatives struggle to find loved ones who had been on train as doctors warn some bodies are disfigured beyond recognition</p><p>As the Coromandel Express train left Shalimar station at 3.20pm on Friday, its carriages were packed to the rafters with migrant labourers, daily wage workers, students and commuters, many seeking opportunity hundreds of miles away in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, the train\u2019s final destination.</p><p>Among them was Chandan Roy, 38, a mason, who was heading south for employment.
