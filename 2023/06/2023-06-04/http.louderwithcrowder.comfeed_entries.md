It was called into question when his GOP primary opponent Donald Trump claimed he does not like using the word because no one knows what it means. Then political journalismers, outsourcing their news desk to the former president, do what they usually do and say "EMRMGAWD, did you hear what Trump said?"</p><p>DeSantis got the question during a campaign stop in Iowa. "Woke" in short is "cultural Marxism."</p><h3>Why are we here?</h3><br /><p>
	Ron DeSantis has been using the word "woke" <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-cnn-contributor" target="_blank">to describe the radical progressive agenda</a> he is fighting against. He has been calling Florida "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-inauguration" target="_blank">where woke goes to die</a>."
</p><p>
	On June 1st, Donald Trump held an event in Iowa where he said (<a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-woke-desantis-like-rcna87352" target="_blank">part cut out of the video in bold</a>): "[<strong>The trans agenda has] gotten sick</strong>, and I don’t like the term woke, because I hear woke, woke, woke. You know it’s like just a term they use half the people can’t even define it. They don’t know what it is."
</p><div class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" style="display: flex; width: 100%; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"></div> <p>
	These were comments made on June 1. Of note, Trump used the word woke <a href="https://twitter.com/bonchieredstate/status/1664368119194828801" target="_blank">in a TruthSocial post on May 28th</a>, and again hours after this video claiming he doesn't like the term <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-calls-military-woke-fox-news-town-hall-1234746083/" target="_blank">while describing what our military has turned into</a>.</p><h3>Care to comment DEEsantis? Or is it DAsantis?</h3><br /><p>
	Ron DeSantis got the question, and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-ap-reporter" target="_blank">at least it is one of the less dumb questions he's gotten</a>. Turns out, "woke" is easy to define.
</p><div class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" style="display: flex; width: 100%; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"></div> <blockquote>Woke is an existential threat to our society. It's an attack on truth. It's a form of cultural Marxism. And it really subordinates merit and achievement to things like identity politics. You can't have a vibrant, free society if every institution is dominated by woke ideology. And to say it's not a big deal, that just shows you don't know what a lot of these issues are.</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>Turns out, Ron DeSantis CAN define "woke." What's funny is that it's a gotcha question I was expecting later on down the road. Trump's comments sped things up and gave the governor time to have an answer prepared.</p><p>I think a better question, and one I am surprised Trump hasn't "truthed" about yet so that someone can share a screen capture on Twitter and reporters can get their next assignment, is where the DeSantis post-announcement polling bump is. At most, I have seen DeSantis get a +2 bump on a national poll while Trump is still up double digits. Even if you consider political polling not as reliable as it used to be (I'm in that camp), it if nothing else proves the Twitter glitch in DeSantis's announcement was a bigger deal than his supporters want to admit. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

The naked boy identifies as a transgender girl so in the eyes of Vermont's educational system, that makes her a girl.</p><p>Besides the settlement, all disciplinary action taken against Blake will be removed from her permanent record, and her father Travis, who lost his coaching job for defending his teenage daughter not wanting to change in front of -- girl -- with a penis, will be reinstated.</p><h3>The road so far...</h3><br /><p>News broke in September 2022 about a Vermont High School, where Blake and other girls were <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/high-school-locker-room" target="_blank">being punished for feeling uncomfortable with the trans student in the girls locker room</a>. </p><p>The drama started when the trans student made an inappropriate comment while members of the volleyball team were getting changed. It's unclear what the inappropriate comment was. The rules get murky because if a cisgendered male made those comments, that male would be expelled from school. But since it's a transgender female, the cisgender females are at fault for not having a sense of humor.</p><blockquote><em>I feel like for stating my opinion -- that I don’t want a biological man changing with me -- that I should not have harassment charges or bullying charges. They should all be dropped.</em></blockquote><p>The news was broken by <a href="https://www.wcax.com/2022/09/28/randolph-high-school-investigating-gender-locker-room-dispute/" target="_blank">local news outlet WCAX-3</a>. They were bullied into removing the story by activists <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/locker-room-article-removed" target="_blank">and told a different news outlet</a> they were "<em>working with LGBTQ advocates on a message to the community acknowledging the harm that was caused.</em></p><p>Other students have spoken out and said <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/locker-room-vermont-speaks-out" target="_blank">the incident isn't solely with the one trans student</a>. Anyone is allowed to use the girls' locker room AND bathrooms.</p><blockquote><em>In a locker room it's made specifically for girls and so having a male with a penis in there it just felt wrong...[the school said] I should go somewhere else if I feel uncomfortable. ... <em>They didn't identify as trans. They said that they were gay so that they weren't attracted to me so they were allowed in [the girls' bathroom].</em></em></blockquote><h3>“Resounding victory for freedom of speech.”</h3><br /><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/vermont-school-board-pays-family-125000-punishing-them-speaking-against-trans-student" target="_blank">As a part of the settlement</a>:</p><ul><li>The Allen family gets $125,000.</li><li>Travis Allen gets reinstated to his job.</li><li>Blake has her permanent record scrubbed of any punishment.</li><li>The school must remove any social media content showing "love and support" to the beautiful and brave trans student in question.</li></ul><p>The school claims the settlement does NOT claim any wrongdoing, and that they just wanted to push the issue behind them. Alliance Defending Freedom senior counsel Phil Sechler, who defended the Allen family, feels otherwise:</p><blockquote>The settlement of Blake and Travis Allen’s case is a resounding victory for freedom of speech. Calling a male a male shouldn’t have cost Travis his job and gotten Blake kicked out of school.</blockquote><p>It will be interesting to see if this sets a residence. Blake is not the only girl who thinks it's wrong for girls to be made uncomfortable in their locker room by students with male genitalia. Nor is she the only one facing disciplinary action, since "trans" remains ranked number one on the left's Pound-for-Pound Most Marginalized Rankings. Teenage girls, particularly those who play sports, have fallen out of the top ten.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
