And what role exactly will Scorpion take in the upcoming Mortal Kombat 1? The game’s reveal trailer has confirmed that he will be returning (not that there was ever any doubt of that), and teased that even though we’ve gone back to the early stages of these characters’ stories (seemingly, at least), Scorpion and Sub-Zero are going to fight as brothers in arms, as they did later in their lives, not as sworn enemies, as most would expect them to be early on. 

It's safe to assume that this new continuity that NetherRealm is now about to establish is going to play with fans’ expectations in interesting ways. Some things might be the same, some might be similar, while others might diverge in entirely unexpected ways. After all, this is pretty much the playbook the developer used when it soft rebooted the franchise with 2011’s Mortal Kombat. 

But how much exactly will change? It seems safe to assume that certain characters (like Quan Chi and Sub-Zero) will continue to be an integral part of Scorpion’s personal story, and that certain events will be crucial factors as well. But will the details to any of those be changed? Might we perhaps see a Scorpion with a completely different life, a completely different past, and as such, a completely different character arc? After all, when Liu Kang set out to create his new timeline, his primary goal was to give everyone in it a much more peaceful life. It should be interesting to see how something like that changes Scorpion’s story, which is very much the antithesis of peaceful- or if it even does. 

One thing is clear without a doubt- that Scorpion, as the de facto face of Mortal Kombat, is going to have a massive role in Mortal Kombat 1’s story. And we can’t wait to find out what that’ll be.

Every time the developer has shown off the action RPG, it has looking increasingly promising, and from its story and storytelling to its combat and its more mature and grounded tone, there's quite a bit about it that's taking our collective excitement levels through the roof. 

There's plenty that we absolutely can't wait to do when we finally get our hands on the game not long from now, and here, we're going to talk about a few of them.
