<p>Billie Jean King battles for female equality and Arthur Ashe fights against systemic racism in this documentary series. It’s a hefty tale, joined by on-court sagas between sporting giants</p><p>My earliest memories of Wimbledon fortnight are of having to let myself silently into the house after school and then commando-crawl across the sitting room on my way to the kitchen for a snack, so that I didn’t obscure a potential match point for my mother and her viewing friends. They were tense times, made tenser by the fact that it was the Björn Borg-John McEnroe era. One half of the audience would be rooting for the silent Swede (including Mum, on the grounds that “he’d not get under your feet”) and the other for the hyperactive “You cannot be serious – the ball was in!” American. “Oh, be quiet,” Mum and I would snarl, in one of our rare moments of temperamental unity.</p><p>The BBC’s three-part documentary Gods of Tennis allows fans to relive those relatively halcyon days, with its first episode focusing on the slightly earlier era of Billie Jean King and Arthur Ashe. To examine the impact the pair had on the game, contemporaneous footage is interspersed with interviews with King (Ashe died in 1993), sports journalists, other players and champions (including Sue Barker, Pam Shriver, Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova and, in later instalments, Borg and McEnroe themselves). And, for some reason, Miriam Margolyes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/04/gods-of-tennis-review-a-hefty-tale-of-the-epic-battles-that-rocked-tennis">Continue reading...</a>

<p>New research shows that for-profit businesses make worse carers. It’s time to admit that privatisation failed</p><p>The privatisation of children’s residential care in England over the past decade <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/29/outsourcing-care-has-led-to-more-children-moving-further-away-study" title="">has resulted in worse outcomes</a>. This has long been suspected by critics of the current system, which is dominated by providers either partly or wholly owned by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/26/revealed-top-10-childrens-care-providers-made-300m-profits" title="">private equity</a> investors. Researchers at Oxford University have now supplied <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953622006293?via%3Dihub" title="">proof</a>. The study found that 17,000 out-of-area placements, which involve moving children away from their home networks, could be attributed to outsourcing between 2011 and 2022. While there is wide variation between local authorities, the ones that rely most on private placements are those with the worst outcomes.</p><p>The frequency of disruption was also measured. Like out-of-area moves, discontinuity is associated with worse experiences, and reduced likelihoods of children developing the capacities and relationships that they need in order to thrive. A vivid demonstration of this was provided in recent weeks by whistleblowers from the chain Outcomes First, following its decision to close 28 homes at short notice. A worker in one of those homes described the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/21/uk-care-home-firm-under-fire-as-children-forced-to-move-hundreds-of-miles" title="">acute and self-destructive distress of one young resident</a>, when told of her transfer, as “one of the saddest things I’ve ever seen”. The Children’s Homes Association, which represents owners, took the unusual step last month of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/21/uk-care-home-firm-under-fire-as-children-forced-to-move-hundreds-of-miles" title="">publicly berating Outcomes First</a>, which is not among its members. These hasty closures, it said, fell “woefully short of the standards expected”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/04/the-guardian-view-on-outsourced-childrens-homes-the-wrong-model">Continue reading...</a>

<p>(OTIH)<br />This long-awaited debut from the south London spoken-word night house band is rich in guests and dark, downbeat textures <br /></p><p>In the mid-00s, Brixton Jamm in south London was home to a well-known open mic night Speakers Corner, which featured a house band going toe-to-toe with local MCs to develop a raucous hip-hop fusion. Seventeen years on from their first performances, that house band are now releasing their debut album, a tribute to the diverse network of collaborators they have gathered in the city.</p><p>Guest Coby Sey opens the 13-track set with his languorous baritone, lending swagger to a downcast guitar riff reminiscent of early the xx, while newcomer Léa Sen provides gorgeously ethereal vocals to the midtempo introspection of Dreaded!. Poets Kae Tempest and James Massiah, meanwhile, command their respective tracks, with the former lending meandering phrasing to the sweeping strings of Geronimo Blues, while Massiah’s staccato delivery punctuates the crackling atmosphere of Hither Green. Instrumentally, <em>Further Out</em>… is remarkably cohesive, thanks to the Quartet’s dark, downbeat textures that support everyone from Sampha to composer Mica Levi. The group maintain control throughout, making this a flawless and packed debut – one that has been worth the wait.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/04/speakers-corner-quartet-further-out-than-the-edge-review-flawless-hymn-to-fusion">Continue reading...</a>

What if this far-fetched story of a doomed troubadour were to have been told by a troubadour itself? It would have been tear-jerking, certainly bloodthirsty – but definitely not po-faced: that would risk losing its audience. And so Thomas’s staging, designed by Annemarie Woods, finds ways to be entertaining without diminishing the tragedy. In its anarchic imagination and the precision with which its cruelty and crudity are executed, it feels inspired by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2017/jan/10/bosch-garden-of-earthly-delights-shows-a-world-waking-up-to-the-future">Hieronymus Bosch</a> – but with the lovers, Leonora and Manrico, lit as if by Vermeer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/04/il-trovatore-review-royal-opera-adele-thomas">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There are plans to harness our seas to help tackle the effects of the climate emergency. But without understanding and respect a life support system for our planet could be trashed</p><p></p><p>The real payoff from the Apollo missions had nothing to do with the moon. The prize was travelling far enough out into space to look back properly at planet Earth. Those two unforgettable images – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/dec/22/behold-blue-plant-photograph-earthrise">Earthrise</a> and <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/blue-marble-image-of-the-earth-from-apollo-17">Blue Marble</a> – showed us our fragile and precious planet, defined by its blue. Since then, we’ve talked proudly about our “blue planet” but without thinking any further about what that blue actually is. We talk about fish and whales, plastic and pollution – the things that are in the water – but not the water itself. The great ocean engine has just kept turning while we scurry about near its surface, only caring when its churning causes something dramatic that we can see – an algal bloom or a giant swarm of jellyfish.</p><p>More than 50 years after Apollo, the ocean is starting to get more attention, but a growing slice of the discussion is based on the assumption that it is there for us to use, a resource to be exploited, a great volume of “nothing” that human inventiveness is going to turn into “something”. And this is incredibly dangerous. Unless humanity starts to see the ocean for what it really is – a critical part of our planetary life support system – we risk sleepwalking into destruction.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/04/why-we-need-to-respect-earths-last-great-wilderness-the-ocean">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A new study says you are more likely to become depressed living in the suburbs than in the city. For me, though, it’s living the dream</p><p>I moved to the suburbs in the spring of 2021, a classic post-lockdown move. My husband and I had been hot-desking between the bedroom and the kitchen table and we were all far too emotionally involved with the rat that frequented our bird feeder. I had wanted to move before Covid: the bed shook when buses went past, and the frequent drunken meltdowns on our conveniently located doorstep left me awkwardly squeezing past sobbing strangers to take the dog for his late-night pee, muttering: “Sorry, could I just …” I had the noise abatement team on speed dial and a throbbing vein in my eyelid.</p><p>Arriving here, where semis with gardens meet the green belt, and cows graze by the big Sainsbury’, was like the switch to colour in The Wizard of Oz, combined with the moment my noise-cancelling headphones kick in: relief and wonder. We slept with the window open and every morning I listened to the birds and smelled the roses, unable to believe my luck. Two years on, I still feel that. I’m incredulous that I get to live here, surrounded by green and birds, in peace so enveloping that I can finally hear myself think (though, wow, it’s boring: “Is that the one-eyed cat?” “Should I have a biscuit?”).</p><p>Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/04/i-moved-from-the-city-to-the-suburbs-and-i-cant-believe-my-luck">Continue reading...</a>

## Overwhelmed in London, I moved to Berlin to save my sanity – and savour a new life

Irish author Naoise Dolan on taking refuge in the German capital<p>I’ve lived in Berlin for nine months now and I have stopped thinking of myself as “learning German”. Instead I hunt daily for German I still don’t know. I enter new words into a flashcard app on my phone and slowly the proportion of German-yet-unknown-to-me diminishes. If I happen to emerge from this process a Germanophone, well and good. But I have never achieved anything by obsessing over a long-term goal; I need to be having fun in the here-and-now to see any sustained project to completion. All the same, I’m easily amused. My flashcard app delights me.</p><p>I moved here last summer from London, where I had essentially lost my mind. (This rationale doesn’t go well in small talk, so I tend to claim instead that I wanted a change of scene.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/04/overwhelmed-in-london-i-moved-to-berlin-to-save-my-sanity-and-savour-a-new-life">Continue reading...</a>

## The rise of perfectionism – and the harm it’s doing us all
 - [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/04/the-rise-of-perfectionism-and-the-harm-its-doing-us-all](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/04/the-rise-of-perfectionism-and-the-harm-its-doing-us-all)

<p>Many of us believe striving for perfection leads to success. But perfectionism is counter-productive and can result in soaring levels of stress. The answer, believes Professor Thomas Curran, is to go a little easier on yourself</p><p>About a decade ago, Thomas Curran, a psychology student, travelled to Australia to embark on a postdoctoral fellowship and was crushed with anxiety, exhaustion and panic attacks. Beyond making the round-the-world flight, he’d really pushed himself hard to make it there. Curran is from Wellingborough, a town in the east Midlands, and grew up “without much money”. His mum used to work as a receptionist at the Hind Hotel, his dad was a construction worker who was famous locally (Curran tells me with a touch of pride) for riding the statue of a deer mounted above the hotel’s entrance. As a teen, Curran thought he’d go into construction, too, but spurred on by the New Labour education drive, he chose university. Now he was far beyond the expectations of his youth – and surely well on the road to success in academia – yet found himself in pieces: “a failure”.</p><p>With all going south Down Under, Curran returned to the UK. At a less prestigious institution, the pressure eased. He dropped his competitive streak and decided “to stop trying to please other people”. Able to let his mind wander, he began to look more forensically at perfectionism, a trait he recognised in himself and – until that point – had rather celebrated. After all, surely it was perfectionism that enabled him to meet the high standards he placed upon himself and rise from his working-class roots? And surely it was the same impulse that kicked him out of bed when he felt crushed by self-criticism, and pushed him through panic attacks to keep striving? “I was genuinely of the belief that perfectionism was the one thing that was holding me up when everything around me was collapsing,” he says. “But it was actually perfectionism that was creating those problems.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/04/the-rise-of-perfectionism-and-the-harm-its-doing-us-all">Continue reading...</a>

## An Uneasy Inheritance: My Family and Other Radicals by Polly Toynbee review – the genes, the dreams

<p>In this heartfelt memoir, the columnist considers how a century-long commitment to human improvement inspired her family</p><p>P<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/pollytoynbee">olly Toynbee</a>’s great-grandfather <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Murray">Gilbert Murray</a>, the finest classical scholar of the early 20th century – and, like so many in Toynbee’s family, an activist for what are now called progressive causes – eventually despaired of his hope for the future. “My greenness was unbelievable,” he wrote in a passage Toynbee quotes. “I believed passionately in the progress of man. It was perhaps not quite inevitable, but it only needed the removal of a few selfish and reactionary old people to make the world a new Garden of Eden, with more scientific gardening.” This faith in human improvement is the chief family trait that Toynbee delineates and wrestles with in her heartfelt memoir, <em>An Uneasy Inheritance</em>. It is a book that places her, and her eminent and unusual family, in the context of their time and tries to reckon with what this means in our own.</p><p>Toynbee probably needs little introduction to most readers of this paper. A columnist for the <em>Guardian</em> for many years, she was formerly the BBC’s social affairs editor and her journalism has won many awards, including the Orwell prize. She is under no illusions, however, that this contemporary renown guarantees any memorial: most of the people she considers here, so well regarded in their day, are largely forgotten in the 21st century. Not only Murray, but her grandfather, historian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_J._Toynbee">Arnold Toynbee</a>, who believed his 12-volume magnum opus, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Study_of_History">A Study of History</a></em>, would be a permanent monument; her grandmother, the ferociously unpleasant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosalind_Murray">Rosalind</a>, who churned out melodramatic novels she was convinced would bring her enduring fame. Of her writer father <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Toynbee">Philip</a> she notes that his “name is barely known now, cropping up here and there in footnotes and anecdotes in other people’s biographies”. Yet part of the pleasure of this volume is the way in which she reanimates their striking lives.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/04/an-uneasy-inheritance-my-family-and-other-radicals-by-polly-toynbee-review-the-genes-the-dreams">Continue reading...</a>

<p>(Sony)<br />Dave Grohl’s affecting lyrics are the main draw on his band’s first album since drummer Taylor Hawkins’s death</p><p>Although released just a year after the suicide of his Nirvana bandmate Kurt Cobain, the Foo Fighters’ 1995 debut was a breezy delight that seemed tonally in stark contrast to the trauma Dave Grohl had so recently experienced. The mood surrounding <em>But Here We Are</em>, arriving a year after the death of drummer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/27/taylor-hawkins-obituary">Taylor Hawkins</a>, couldn’t be more different. Throughout, the lyrics bear the scars of grief: “Think I’m getting over it/ But there’s no getting over it”; “I’ve been hearing voices/ None of them are you”; “You showed me how to grieve/ But never showed me how to say goodbye.”</p><p>It’s a shame, then, that the songs accompanying Grohl’s most powerfully affecting set of lyrics so often fail to reach the same standard. Rescued, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seok6lO1n-8">Under You</a> and the title track are the sort of route-one, bellowed stadium-pleasers that the Foos have been knocking out with diminishing returns for the past 20 years. The 10-minute The Teacher pitches for “epic” but plods rather, although its impassioned, static-drenched ending just about makes up for that. The best moment, Rest, is the simplest: a touching goodbye that builds from quiet acoustic strumming to genuinely moving full-band climax.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/04/foo-fighters-but-here-we-are-review-grieving-route-one-stadium-rock">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This madcap stop-motion tale of saving the world from cataclysmic bovine explosion is funny, silly – and not for children</p><p>Eastern Europe has a tradition of taking animation as a medium to unexpected places. And this gloriously unsavoury Estonian adventure certainly does so, in a madcap adventure that takes place, partly at least, in a bear’s stomach. The animation style is a crude stop motion, the characters have a single facial expression (wide-eyed, stricken, a bit deranged, in case you were wondering), the plot involves a race against time, for the Old Man and his grandchildren to rescue a prized cow from the murderous Old Milker, and to save the world from a cataclysmic bovine explosion. It’s very silly, very funny and categorically not for younger audiences.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/04/the-old-man-movie-lactopalypse-review-gloriously-unsavoury-estonian-animation">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘I won’t be getting my kit off again’: The Full Monty’s Robert Carlyle on the role of a lifetime

Robert Carlyle’s life has been defined by two remarkable characters: the explosively violent Begbie, and Gaz in The Full Monty. Here, he talks about his Glasgow childhood, Britpop hedonism – and playing the PM…<p>It was 1997, and Robert Carlyle was in his mid-30s, when he first played the stripping Sheffield steelworker Gaz in <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/26/how-we-made-the-full-monty-bums" title="">The Full Monty</a></em>. Last year, to get ready to play him again – this time for an eight-part <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/19/full-monty-disney-plus-simon-beaufoy-alice-nutter" title="">TV series</a> – he sat himself down to watch the film. He seems slightly embarrassed to admit it – he’s not the kind of actor who likes to watch himself. “And I’m not about trawling back through something from 20-odd years ago,” he says. But <em>The Full Monty</em> was calling him to South Yorkshire, so trawl back he did. He decided that he would watch a few minutes, then he would move on. “And I sat there and watched the whole thing.” He was surprised to find that it still worked, even after 25 years. “I don’t know if I can say this, but I really enjoyed it. It really stands up.”</p><p>The original <em>Full Monty</em> told the story of six unemployed men from Sheffield who put on a DIY strip show at the working men’s club. It was an indie film, shot on a very small budget, and it almost went straight to video; a last-minute re-edit saved it from obscurity and it went on to be a staggering global success, making £200m at the box office. Carlyle’s Gaz is the ringleader, a schemer and a dreamer trying to keep enough money in his pocket to put the heating on when his son comes to stay.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/04/i-wont-be-getting-my-kit-off-again-the-full-montys-robert-carlyle-on-the-role-of-a-lifetime">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Jack Grealish was penalised for inadvertently touching the ball with his fingers, giving United the chance to equalise</p><p>As it turned out, it didn’t affect the destination of the FA Cup or deny Manchester City a chance at the treble, but it might have done. Manchester United had created very little when suddenly VAR gave them a penalty for something almost nobody appealed. Assuredly, under the laws, as they are now interpreted, the decision was correct. Jack Grealish’s hand was raised almost to shoulder height as Aaron Wan-Bissaka’s header struck it, and that these days is an offence. But really, why should it be?</p><p>Why should games be decided not by skill or heart, by organisation or improvisation, but by 75% chances of a goal handed out because of random bounces and bobbles? Grealish was not cheating. He did not seek to gain an advantage. He just jumped and, in twisting to see where the ball went, his arm went out to balance him. This wasn’t a Peter Schmeichel-style star jump, spreading himself to make a block; it was just a man jumping, his arms doing what arms do when somebody jumps.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/04/jack-grealish-ruling-in-fa-cup-final-further-proves-absurdity-of-handball">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Barnaby Thompson’s well-researched documentary highlights the contradictions of the sparkling playwright’s life</p><p>He was the epitome of a certain kind of urbane, aristocratic Englishness. But Noël Coward grew up in relative poverty, in his mother’s boarding house. He was famously erudite but an autodidact (he left school at nine to earn a living as a child performer). He was both a satirist and a sentimentalist; a heart-throb who was covertly gay.</p><p>This very enjoyable and informative documentary, directed by Barnaby Thompson, digs into the contradictions underpinning the life and work of one of the most prolific and versatile talents of the 20th century. The film draws on a wealth of archive material, including plenty of Coward delivering waspish witticisms in interviews, but also more personal, previously unseen material culled from his holiday home movies. It’s a fascinating portrait of the man, and of an era – a time in which a wildly successful entertainer had to be wary of wearing a polo neck sweater in public, for fear of inadvertently outing himself.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/04/mad-about-the-boy-the-noel-coward-story-review-fascinating-portrait-of-a-20th-century-great">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>New Vic theatre, Newcastle-under-Lyme<br /></strong>Conrad Nelson’s fast-flowing production, which races through time and space, exemplifies the ingenuity of regional theatre</p><p>In <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/17/arts-council-britain-plan-save-new-body">a recent article</a> for the <em>Guardian</em>, the theatre director Nicholas Hytner argued that Arts Council England funding should be directed towards professional performances, while a new body should be set up to encourage and support community, education and outreach programmes. This would, he proposed, complement the Arts Council in the same way Sport England complements UK Sport. The response? Instant Twitter uproar, with the proposition being interpreted as setting “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/25/changes-arts-funding-divisive-culture">one type of art against another</a>”, in the words of Nicholas Serota, replying to Hytner a few days later.

Deborah McAndrew’s sharp, funny and faithful adaptation follows the picaresque progress of Denry Machin, the eponymous “card”, from lowly solicitor’s clerk to youngest-ever mayor of a fictional Potteries town. Fast-flowing action, under Conrad Nelson’s assured direction, races us through time and space: town square; solicitor’s office; grand ballroom with swirling dancers; widow’s hovel; bustling seaside promenade; storm, shipwreck, rescue; newspaper office; football stadium.

New ways with the refreshing green leaves of early summer<p>These days of early summer with crisp young greens at the market and the garden fizzing with new growth are glorious. This week, I stuffed great handfuls of spinach – thick stemmed, leaves as pointed as an arrow – into a deep saucepan, letting them cook for a minute or two in their own steam, then tossed them with young broad beans into a classic, aromatic white sauce. The filling was then covered with a rubble of butter crumbs and baked until the green-freckled sauce bubbled up around the edges and the crumble was lightly crisp.</p><p>Deeper into summer, I will make this recipe with lightly cooked runner beans and shredded summer cabbage. Blanched asparagus may go in, too, especially now the price of homegrown spears has come down. The crucial point is to make a seriously good sauce, using cloves, bay leaves and onion, but also to give your sauce the baptism of time. A béchamel, thoughtfully seasoned and given a good 25 minutes or longer over a very low heat with scarcely a bubble to be heard, is a cook’s time well spent.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/04/nigel-slater-recipes-green-vegetable-crumble-and-cucumber-microgreens-and-wasabi-salad">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Rob Savage’s first big picture, based on a Stephen King short story, is scary but hardly groundbreaking</p><p>It was only a matter of time before Rob Savage, director of the inventive and terrifying lockdown Zoom horror <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/aug/16/house-of-horror-host-the-zoom-call-hit-movie-that-has-hollywood-quaking">Host</a></em> and the anarchic livestream splatterfest <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jun/05/dashcam-review-rob-savage-takes-us-for-a-hell-of-a-ride">Dashcam</a></em>, was tapped to direct a studio picture. And as this adaptation of a Stephen King short story shows, he certainly knows his way around the genre.</p><p>A recently bereaved family – a widowed father (Chris Messina) and his two daughters (Sophie Thatcher, Vivien Lyra Blair) – find that their grief leaves them vulnerable to something malign, a voracious evil entity with arachnid legs and several sets of teeth that dwells in the shadows. And there are plenty of hiding places in the family home, with its murky stained-glass windows and walls that seem to soak up the light like blotting paper.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/04/the-boogeyman-rob-savage-review-so-so-studio-debut-from-a-budget-horror-meister">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As a new wave of ethnic violence hits Kosovo, one of the mayors whose  election sparked hate and anger says criminal gangs are leading the ‘revolt’</p><p>Sitting behind a bare black desk, in a small whitewashed room in northern Kosovo, village mayor, Izmir Zeqiri, is still getting used to the glare of international attention. “It wasn’t my intention to be a celebrity,” he says as his mobile phone rings on repeat. “We thought more people would run, and we didn’t imagine we could win.”</p><p>This isn’t false modesty. Zeqiri is one of a few hundred ethnic Albanians in the Serb-majority municipality of Zubin Potok, and his candidacy in April’s elections was a symbolic gesture. But when Serb List, the Belgrade-backed party that controls much of public life in the Serb-majority northern municipalities, decided to boycott the poll and ordered Serb voters to follow suit, Zeqiri was propelled into the eye of a storm.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/04/weve-never-felt-free-of-the-serbs-albanian-kosovans-blame-belgrade-for-violence">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Lyric; Ambassadors; Park theatre, London</strong><br />A superb cast, including opera star Danielle de Niese, elevates Andrew Lloyd Webber’s plodding 80s musical; Maureen Lipman gives a one-woman masterclass; and Neil LaBute’s romcom gets a sharp, funny revival</p><p>Andrew Lloyd Webber’s musical <strong><a href="https://www.aspectsoflove.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw4NujBhC5ARIsAF4Iv6djSyJjJSxj84v6y6v5IN-F0WZQkZgHyH9Rdq8ao5ESbW8lneU45ZAaAoK_EALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">Aspects of Love</a></strong> was first performed in 1989 and is based on a second-rate novel by David Garnett, published in 1955. The deficiencies of the novel could fill a column – and that’s before you even get started on the musical and its plodding score. I had low expectations as I trudged along Shaftesbury Avenue towards the theatre, but now find myself with the unexpected pleasure of having to report that I should have approached the first night with a more open mind. For this is a spectacular production – everything I assumed it would not, could not be. So much talent has been lobbed at it that it overrides the musical’s many and varied faults.</p><p>Jonathan Kent directs with sure-footed flair, the cast is top-notch, and the recruiting of opera designer John Macfarlane is a masterstroke. His design is a romance in itself. It’s like going on a grand tour of Europe, stopping off at airy Parisian apartments, travelling through painterly French landscapes and overlooking glowing Venetian canals – no one with the slightest trace of wanderlust could possibly resist his gloriously escapist vision. And at the same time, Douglas O’Connell’s original use of photographic imagery turns what ought to be hackneyed scenes – such as a black-and white Parisian street in the rain – into elegant panels, contributing to the set’s multilayered magic.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/04/aspects-of-love-lyric-theatre-review-jonathan-kent-rose-maureen-lipman-ambassadors-the-shape-of-things-park-theatre-neil-labute">Continue reading...</a>

But this week it decided they were in fact lost, and so couldn’t be submitted anyway. How careless this government has been in this respect. The health minister Lord Bethell lost his phone when a July 2021 hearing wanted it. Tories should have to write all their communications on their hands in permanent marker. And if the WhatsApps were lost how did anyone in the Cabinet Office get to look at them to decide they were irrelevant? No one at senior government level had thought it through.

<p>Decades of civil war and economic meltdowns left Lebanon’s people struggling for hope – and then three years ago came the devastating explosion in the capital’s port. But the country’s creatives are fighting back. Introduction by Joumana Haddad, interviews by Killian Fox</p><p>Can you imagine what it meant to grow up in Beirut during Lebanon’s civil war in the 1980s? If a shell didn’t kill you, hopelessness surely would. And death by despair is a thousand times worse, and more final, than death by a missile. But something kept me hopeful and alive, day after day, despite all the misery and desolation surrounding me. Something almighty, intensely transformative – something magical: it was literature.</p><p>I didn’t read to learn (the latter was a mere collateral benefit); I read to unlearn. To unlearn hate and fear and distress and despair. To unlearn closed doors and clipped wings and tunnels without a light at the end of them. I read to forget everything and everyone that was trying to kill me, outside as well as inside.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jun/04/rebirth-artists-creation-beirut-war-lebanon">Continue reading...</a>

He graduated from the Royal College of Art, and worked as a cleaner and a teacher until 2013 when one of his paintings, with an estimated value of $30,000, sold for $401,000 at auction in New York. In 2019, Murillo – whose work includes paintings, videos and room-sized installations – was one of four artists<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/dec/04/its-about-solidarity-the-artists-who-hijacked-the-turner-prize-speak-out"> </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/dec/03/turner-prize-2019-lawrence-abu-hamdan-helen-cammock-oscar-murillo-and-tai-shani-shared">to be jointly awarded the Turner prize</a>.

The work began, many years ago, to take me everywhere. And the pandemic really accelerated that, even though things collapsed in terms of movement. But I moved to my village [La Paila] where I grew up in Colombia and I lived there during the entire lockdown. And it was a beautiful experience to live in such a context as an adult for the first time – as opposed to being a tourist. You understand better the social complexities of Colombia and the politics. The crisis that the country has been living for decades.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/04/oscar-murillo-painter-gagosian-exhibition-manifestations-turner-interview">Continue reading...</a>

There are rich pickings at Läderach – where the staff are generous with tasters<p>Whereas usually I am fairly restrained in my chocolate eating, I have of late been on a toboggan ride into overindulgence. It started with some <strong>Läderach</strong> nougatine eggs (not currently available as they were an Easter special) which were so delicious and creamy, but also crunchy and chewy, that they transported me back to a childhood which didn’t exist, but reminded me of how you’d have liked Toblerone to have tasted. Anyway, they were so excellent that I hid them from my other testers (always a good/bad sign).</p><p>Then I started working my way through Läderach’s <a href="https://laderach.com/uk-en/10098251-frischschoggitm-pouch-small" title="">FrischSchoggi,</a> which is chocolate (milk, dark or white; the milk is sublime and perfect if you are a Lindt lover as this is creamy and smooth, but several steps above) in slab shape, mixed with various inclusions: nuts, dried fruits and berries, more nuts. Prices start at £16.65 for a bag of ‘shards’, but if you can afford it, the pouches offer a good selection from £23.75/250g.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/04/notes-on-chocolate-annalisa-barbieri-laderach-like-toblerone-for-grown-ups">Continue reading...</a>

This record-as-autobiographical-duets-party has a wide and deep guest list, from the head-scratching (Chaka Khan on Cotton-Eyed Joe? Better than it promises) to the riveting.

Why are Rupert and co so obsessed with not being identified with the fictional Roys?<p>It was a term of Jerry Hall’s divorce settlement from Rupert Murdoch, according to <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2023/04/rupert-murdoch-cover-story" title=""><em>Vanity Fair</em></a>, that she couldn’t “give story ideas” to the writers of <em>Succession</em>.

That was four years before Hall was let go, in terms that only emphasised the gulf between Murdochian reality and a <em>Succession</em> script. “Jerry, sadly I’ve decided to call an end to our marriage,” went her husband’s unexpected email, according to <em>Vanity Fair</em>. “We have certainly had some good times, but I have much to do.” You wondered if an earlier wife, Wendy Deng, <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2014/03/wendi-deng-note-tony-blair" title="">mocked for her musings on Tony Blair</a> (“He has such good body and he has really really good legs Butt …”) wasn’t actually more fluent than her ex.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/04/succession-wasnt-about-murdochs-surely-how-they-like-to-see-themselves">Continue reading...</a>

People, especially young people, have dialled down their expectations, even their fantasies<p>The first time I saw a house as a competition prize I laughed. What a thing, I thought! What a thing! I kept my eye out for more, and over the years they multiplied, the competitions now a little industry in themselves, newspaper pieces written about the winners, photographs of happy couples standing in the driveways of newbuilds holding large silver suitcases of cash. My friends enter the competitions wryly, ruefully, as if chucking coins into a fountain, why not?</p><p>Last week there was a big magazine <a href="https://nymag.com/press/2023/05/how-much-does-an-ideal-grown-up-life-in-new-york-city-cost.html" title="">piece</a> where young New Yorkers were interviewed about their dream lives, then, looking at real estate listings and school fees and takeaway prices, calculated exactly how much such a life would cost. I am what I kindly choose to describe as a curious person – someone who peers quite deeply into lighted windows and the lives of others, and who subscribes to a number of publications that focus almost exclusively on walking the reader around strangers’ fabulous homes – so this magazine piece gripped me. While many of my friends find this practice (which includes time spent staring glazily at estate agents’ websites) vaguely sickening and morally weak, it relaxes me – I’m comfortable in that cold water, the vast moat between how we live, and how we thought we would.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/04/eva-wiseman-since-when-was-an-affordable-rent-the-stuff-of-our-dreams">Continue reading...</a>

## Reality review – palm-sweatingly tense whistleblower drama

<p>Tina Satter’s verbatim film about the FBI’s interrogation of US intelligence leaker Reality Winner, played by The White Lotus’s Sydney Sweeney, is a stranger-than-fiction reflection of our precarious times</p><p>Legal transcripts have long provided rich source material for authentically gripping movies. Last year, the Tribeca festival showcased <em><a href="https://tribecafilm.com/films/courtroom-2022">The Courtroom</a></em>, a well-received deportation drama featuring “dialogue taken directly from court transcripts”. But it’s not just courtrooms that provide such inspiration. Think back to the “verbatim theatre” of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/25/clio-barnard-on-her-bradford-love-story-ali-ava-joy-is-an-act-of-resistance">Clio Barnard</a>’s 2010 feature debut <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/17/the-arbor-review">The Arbor</a></em>, in which actors lip-synced recorded interviews about the troubled life of the playwright Andrea Dunbar. In the 2013 TV show <em>Nixon’s </em><em>the One</em>, Harry Shearer reimagined Tricky Dicky’s secret audio tapes as video recordings, creating an absurdist black comedy from word-for-word Oval Office transcripts. More recently, James Spinney and Peter Middleton’s documentary <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/20/the-real-charlie-chaplin-review-documentary-peter-middleton-james-spinney">The Real Charlie Chaplin</a></em><em> </em>(2021) added dramatised visuals to archived audio to bring the controversial cinema pioneer’s legend to life.</p><p>In 2019, playwright Tina Satter used the FBI transcript of an interview with NSA-contracted translator and US Air Force veteran Reality Leigh Winner as the basis of her verbatim play <em>Is This </em><em>a Room</em>. On 3 June 2017, Winner had been accosted by two FBI agents, Justin C Garrick and R Wallace Taylor, outside her home in Augusta, Georgia. The agents, who recorded the encounter, told Winner they had a warrant to search her home arising from “the possible mishandling of classified information” – a violation of the 1917 Espionage Act. That same act would later be cited in an August 2022 warrant for Mar-a-Lago, the Florida residence of the former president for whom Russian military intelligence (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/25/reality-winner-leaked-file-on-russia-election-hacking-because-public-was-being-lied-to">according to a report leaked by Winner</a>) had attempted to secure election victory in 2016. Yet while Teflon Don’s own classified documents scandal is still ongoing, it’s inconceivable that Trump will face anything like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/23/reality-winner-sentence-classified-report-leak">the harsh sanctions handed down to Winner</a> in 2018.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/04/reality-review-palm-sweatingly-tense-whistleblower-drama-reality-winner-tina-satter">Continue reading...</a>

For Marilyn Monroe it was eggs in a glass of milk, for Muhammad Ali it was steak… Rebecca Seal reveals what seven great figures from history had for breakfast - and how you can make it for yourself<p>In 1952, Marilyn Monroe was photographed, wrapped in a bedsheet, making what she said was her usual breakfast: two eggs beaten into milk warmed on a hot plate that she kept in her motel rooms, which provides about a third of an adult’s daily protein in one glass. As she put it: “When it’s hot, I break two raw eggs into the milk, whip them up with a fork, and drink them while I’m dressing. I supplement this with a multivitamin pill, and I doubt if any doctor could recommend a more nourishing breakfast for a working girl in a hurry.” Nourishing perhaps, but not especially delicious, which is why it’s nicer with a little added sugar, nutmeg and vanilla.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/04/breakfasting-with-the-stars-how-the-famous-got-their-day-going">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Recent polls in Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey and Finland tell the story of voters swayed by fear and prejudice. Progressive parties – take note Keir Starmer – need a clear, principled agenda to turn that tide</p><p>Why does the left keep losing? It’s not a question liberals and progressives particularly want to confront, but look around. Reactionary parties of the political right and far right are once more on the rise and on the march across Europe, as shown again by last week’s lopsided election results in Spain and Italy.</p><p>Each country is different, its circumstances unique. Yet a broad pattern is discernible – and it’s not difficult to trace. The banal common denominator is that parties of the European left, hard and soft, are too fractured and fractious to build winning coalitions that offer convincing alternative solutions to voters’ problems. Like Spain and Italy, recent election outcomes in Greece, Turkey and Finland suggest the dominant issues for electorates are the cost of living, energy and inflation. Other shared worries include security (foreign and domestic), migration, climate and environment, and national identity (loosely defined).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2023/jun/04/europes-lurch-to-the-right-rolls-on-only-unity-on-the-left-can-stop-it">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Modelling of the result suggests the former PM will lose a significant amount of support within the party, and possibly his own seat</p><p>Judging by the polls and by May’s local elections, things aren’t looking too clever for the Conservatives.

Nothing is being destroyed in adding diversity and sexual equality to old stories<p>Should we update classic stories with modern morals? Two film-based kerfuffles have reopened the question. Reports that the next James Bond “won’t be white” have provoked a backlash, as did the launch of Disney’s <em>The Little Mermaid</em>, which features a black Ariel.</p><p>Negative “review bombing” of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/27/the-little-mermaid-review-bland-but-good-natured-disney-remake-halle-bailey" title="">film</a>, which has been the target of criticism since its lead actor, Halle Bailey, was announced, caused the Internet Movie Database to make <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/01/the-little-mermaid-subjected-to-review-bombing-with-mass-negative-reactions-posted-by-bots" title="">a rare intervention</a> and change its ratings system. There is abhorrent racism on show here – about which perhaps little more needs to be said. But alongside it is a broader, longer running argument that might be worth addressing. Namely, that 21st-century mores – diversity, sexual equality, and so on – should not be shoehorned into old stories.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/04/contemporary-values-no-place-in-fairytales-you-must-be-living-in-a-fantasy-world">Continue reading...</a>

Often pilloried, life in the suburbs can be uplifting. If only our homes were less ugly<p>Poking fun at suburbia and its residents has long been a staple of popular culture. From the self-importance of Holloway-residing Charles Pooter in George and Weedon Grossmith’s 1892 <em>The</em> <em>Diary of a Nobody</em>, to Tom and Barbara’s zeal for self-sufficiency in Surbiton in the 1970s sitcom <em>The Good Life</em>, gentle digs at suburban living are a time-honoured British comic tradition.</p><p>There’s often a hint of snobbishness about it, too, that jars slightly with me as a child of suburbia. Monotonous houses, nosy curtain-twitchers, tedious commutes: the suburbs have a bad rep. Yet for my parents, everything they represented – a detached home, a garden, a garage – was firmly aspirational when they first moved to the UK as teenagers in the 1960s, and it was a huge source of pride when they eventually made it there with their two young daughters.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/04/suburbia-doesnt-have-to-steal-your-soul-just-ask-barbara-and-tom-of-the-good-life">Continue reading...</a>

Whether on trans or other issues, speaking out to silence others has no place in a democratic society<p>Kenan Malik makes some valid and nuanced points about the tendency of people on both the left and the right to defend freedom of speech only for views with which they agree (“<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/28/defence-of-free-speech-should-not-depend-whose-side-you-take-in-culture-wars" title="">If you defend free speech, you must defend it all and not silence those you disagree with</a>”, Comment). But he is wrong to invoke freedom of speech to defend attempts to silence certain views.</p><p>Malik describes the fact that the Oxford student union was forced to retract a public demand that “gender critical” feminist Kathleen Stock should be no-platformed as a “blatant denial of free speech”. He implies that it is hypocritical for free-speech advocates not to support the right to attempt to silence others. But this confuses the right to protest and criticise with a right to attempt to silence those with opposing views.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2023/jun/04/freedom-of-speech-resist-rise-of-intolerant-observer-letters">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Australian star’s modesty, likeability and vulnerability have aided her enduring appeal, and now, 36 years after I Should Be So Lucky, the pop princess has won over the TikTok generation</p><p>One of the great unwritten rules of showbusiness could be: never write off La Minogue. As she turns 55, Kylie Minogue is back at the top of the charts with the single Padam Padam, inspired by the 1951 Édith Piaf song of the same name. It has topped the UK Big Top 40, becoming Minogue’s highest-charting single since 2014’s Into the Blue.</p><p>It could be on track to bother the upper reaches of the US Billboard Hot 100, like her 2001 global smash Can’t Get You Out of My Head. “Thank you, thank you,” said Minogue in her birthday Instagram post: “My heart is bursting with joy.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/04/kylie-minogue-at-55-why-we-just-cant-get-the-singer-out-of-our-heads">Continue reading...</a>

The live-fire grilling at Parakeet is really exciting, but their dog-friendly policy is barking mad<p><strong>The Parakeet, 256 Kentish Town Road, London NW5 2AA (<a href="https://theparakeetpub.com/">theparakeetpub.com</a>). Snacks £3.50-£8.50, small plates £10-£15, large plates £23-£42, wines from £25</strong></p><p>There are many things that might improve a restaurant experience. Having a stranger’s chunky dog rub its hind quarters against you, then lick your companion’s hand is not one of them. The team at the Parakeet in London’s Kentish Town might well feel this is an unfair way to begin this column, given the plaudits they’ve received for their food. They’re about to get a few more of those plaudits. But I review restaurants, not just the food they serve. The first thing I mentioned to friends after eating there wasn’t the lovely lamb belly with courgette and anchovy or the terrific house pickles – we’ll come back to them – but the bloody dog. And the way various waiters told me they hated the pro-dog policy (guide dogs, excepted).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/04/the-parakeet-london-the-food-is-great-but-beware-of-the-dogs-restaurant-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Blast near Dnipro leaves 20 injured; Zelenskiy says Ukraine is ready to launch counteroffensive; Prigozhin says Kremlin factions are destroying Russia</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia+ukraine">See all our Russia-Ukraine war coverage</a></li></ul><p><strong>Twenty people including five children were injured from an explosion that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/04/dnipro-explosion-leaves-ukrainian-rescuers-digging-in-rubble-for-survivors">hit a two-storey residential building</a></strong> near the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro on Saturday, the regional governor said. Rescuers pulled residents out from under the rubble, Serhiy Lysak said, posting online that three of the children were in serious condition. A total of 17 people were being treated in hospital. Reports on social media said a Russian missile caused the blast and that an emergency services building was also hit.</p><p><strong>Ukraine</strong> <strong>is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/03/zelenskiy-says-ukraine-ready-to-launch-counteroffensive">ready to launch</a> its long-awaited counteroffensive to recapture Russian-occupied territory, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said </strong>in an interview published on Saturday. The Ukrainian president said: “We strongly believe that we will succeed. I don’t know how long it will take … but we are going to do it and we are ready.”</p><p><strong>Ukraine’s plans for the counteroffensive remained on track</strong>, the deputy defence minister, Volodymyr Havrylov, told Reuters on Saturday, despite the “unprecedented” wave of missile and drone attacks across the country in recent weeks.</p><p><strong>Ukraine’s counteroffensive plan is “very impressive” and can succeed</strong>, Gen David Petraeus told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, adding that the Ukrainians were “determined to liberate their country”. Petraeus, who has headed the CIA and led international forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, has been in Kyiv recently, meeting Volodymyr Zelenskiy and others.</p><p><strong>Russian mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin has said Kremlin factions are destroying the state</strong> by trying to sow discord between him and Chechen fighters. He said on Saturday that a dispute between him and Chechen forces had been resolved. But the Wagner chief blamed the discord on unidentified Kremlin factions, which he calls “Kremlin towers”.</p><p><strong>Two people were killed and two injured by Ukrainian artillery fire on Russia’s Belgorod region</strong> on Saturday, said the governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov. He wrote on Telegram: “Since this morning, settlements in the Shebekino urban district have been under fire from the Ukrainian armed forces.” Ukraine has denied attacking Belgorod, saying Russian rebels are responsible.</p><p><strong>Yevgeny Prigozhin said he was ready to send fighters to the Belgorod region</strong>, which borders Ukraine and has come under intense shelling.</p><p><strong>Kyrgyzstan’s</strong> <strong>president has said his ex-Soviet republic was ready to work with the EU. </strong>Sadyr Japarov, whose country is an ally of Moscow, said on Saturday: “Kyrgyzstan is ready to work hand in hand with the European Union to resolve shared problems, encourage dialogue and find lasting solutions.”</p><p><strong>Indonesia’s defence minister, Prabowo Subianto, has proposed a peace plan for the war in Ukraine</strong>, calling for a demilitarised zone and a UN referendum in what he called disputed territory. However, the proposal was dismissed by Ukraine.</p><p><strong>The Kremlin has banned western journalists from “Russia’s Davos”. </strong>The Kremlin said journalists from “unfriendly countries” would not be allowed into the St Petersburg international economic forum, which begins on 14 June and which President Vladimir Putin has used to showcase the Russian economy to global investors.</p><p><strong>The forced deployment of once-elite Russian VDV troops to Bakhmut </strong>amid the withdrawal of Wagner mercenary forces means “the whole Russian force is likely to be less flexible in reacting to operational challenges”, the UK Ministry of Defence has said.</p><p><strong>During an inspection of more than 4,800 shelters, 252 were locked and a further 893 “unfit for use”</strong>, the Ukrainian interior ministry said through its press service.
