  <p id="E5Vzf8">In today’s day and age, it often feels like we’re constantly wanting our devices to offer more — more pixels, more sensors, more processing power. However, a back-to-the-basics fitness tracker like the <strong>Fitbit Inspire 3 </strong>can be a welcome change of pace, especially since it’s on sale at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Management-Intensity-Tracking-Midnight/dp/B0B5F9SZW7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.me/cjU6aBvfuCP">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Ffitbit-inspire-3-activity-tracker%2F-%2FA-87436321&amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Target</a> right now for $79.95 ($20 off).</p>

<p id="loZQWD">The Inspire 3 is pretty bare-bones, but that’s by design. You won’t find built-in GPS or virtual assistants like Alexa or Google Assistant, but rather a color OLED screen and a colorful, comfortable band that’s reminiscent of the kind you’d find on the Fitbits of the late-aughts. Still, the fitness band can last up to 10 days on a single charge and offers a few modern conveniences, including...</p>

  <p id="ZHdmR0">Apple TVs will get native VPN app support in tvOS 17, according to an Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/si/newsroom/2023/06/tvos-17-brings-facetime-and-video-conferencing-to-apple-tv-4k/">press release</a> (via <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/06/09/tvos-17-apple-tv-vpn/"><em>9to5Mac</em>)</a>. It’s one of many features that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/7/23750717/apple-wwdc-2023-ios-ipados-17-mac-os-sonoma-macbook-air-mac-studio-mac-pro-features">didn’t make it into the keynote</a> at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23726938/apple-wwdc-2023-news-rumors-announcements-vr-headset">WWDC 2023</a>, but it could be a big deal for some folks. Assuming native VPN apps on Apple’s streaming box work as they do elsewhere, you might not have to wait to get home to catch up on streaming shows when traveling with an Apple TV 4K in tow.</p>
<p id="O7Y2lM">Right now, in tvOS 17, to use a VPN with your Apple TV, you’ll need to do something like install a VPN on your router to do it, and not all routers support this. Native VPN support is one of the rare advantages Google’s Chromecast or Amazon’s Fire TV devices hold over the Apple TV right now.</p>
