The camera Canon teased at Photo Next features the company\u2019s V branding, which it typically reserves for consumer-facing products.

While the company has sometimes been <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/why-nikon-and-canon-have-given-up-on-dsl-rs-133042286.html\"><ins>slow to embrace new technologies</ins></a>, Canon\u2019s usual slow pace could work in its favor this time around. Consumer VR has been slow to take off, but with Apple\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-vision-pro-hands-on-a-new-milestone-for-mixed-reality-060943291.html\"><ins>recent entry</ins></a> into the space, the camera manufacturer could be ideally positioned to take advantage of growing interest in the format once the market is more mature.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/canon-made-a-prototype-180--and-360-degree-vr-camera-181522068.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/canon-made-a-prototype-180--and-360-degree-vr-camera-181522068.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-10 18:15:22+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "\u2018Mortal Kombat 1\u2019 made a great first impression at SGF 2023", "description": "<p>One of the biggest reveals from a generally muted SGF showcase was gameplay footage from<em> Mortal Kombat 1. </em>Technically the 12th mainline game restarts the entire universe.

Writing for <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-8-camera-leak-3333575/\"><em><ins>Android Authority</ins></em></a>, leaker Kamila Wojciechowska, who has a solid record when it comes to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/leaked-pixel-fold-video-shows-an-internal-display-with-chunky-bezels-164425413.html\"><ins>Pixel leaks</ins></a>, says Google's next pair of high-end phones will feature Samsung ISOCELL GN2 sensors. That's the same sensor found on the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s-22-review-sprucing-up-a-solid-foundation-151522033.html\"><ins>Galaxy S22</ins></a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s23-review-a-solid-phone-thats-probably-not-worth-the-upgrade-173026346.html\"><ins>S23</ins></a>. More notably, it's a significant upgrade over the ISOCELL GN1 Google has used since the Pixel 6. The GN2 is physically larger and capable of capturing 35 percent more light than its predecessor, making it a better low-light performer. It also supports more modern features, including 8K/30 fps video capture and Staggered HDR. Google could use the latter to reduce ghosting in HDR images.</p><p>According to Wojciechowska, both the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro will come with the GN2. However, Google's flagship will also reportedly pack a few exclusive upgrades. The Pixel 8 Pro will feature a new time-of-flight sensor that should improve autofocus performance and, more significantly, a more modern sensor for its ultra-wide camera. Google reportedly plans to use the 64-megapixel Sony IMX787, the same sensor that powers the Pixel 7a's primary camera, to replace the Pixel 7 Pro's aging 12-megapixel IMX386. The former is almost twice the size of its predecessor and should produce much better images. Wojciechowska notes the version of the Pixel 8 Pro Google is currently testing doesn't come with a macro mode, though they suggest that doesn't mean the final version won't ship with that feature. The Pixel 8 will continue to use the IMX386 but may offer a lens with a wider field of view for those who want to capture more of a scene at once. Wojciechowska says the selfie and telephoto cameras on the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro are unchanged from those on the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro. Lastly, they note the Pixel 8 Pro's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/googles-pixel-8-pro-could-have-a-built-in-thermometer-114808668.html\"><ins>rumored thermometer sensor</ins></a> won't be used for photography.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Naturally, Google also has software upgrades planned. The company will reportedly update its camera app to allow Pixel users to decide how strong the bokeh effect is when using the &quot;Cinematic&quot; video mode. Additionally, a new &quot;Adaptive torch&quot; feature may dynamically adjust the output of a phone's flash module to prevent it from overexposing images.</p><p>Considering Google has had a history of sticking with the same camera sensor for multiple Pixel generations, it's encouraging to learn the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro could feature new, more capable camera hardware. Google has done a lot with its computational software, but there are only so many visual enhancements you can squeeze out of a camera sensor without going for a bigger one.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/googles-pixel-8-pro-could-feature-a-larger-more-capable-main-camera-sensor-163235885.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/googles-pixel-8-pro-could-feature-a-larger-more-capable-main-camera-sensor-163235885.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-10 16:32:35+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Watch three back-to-back Summer Game Fest shows here starting at 12PM ET", "description": "<p>Another busy day of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/sgf-2023/\">Summer Game Fest events</a> is upon us, with the Wholesome Direct, Future Games Show and OTK Games Expo streams running back to back.

While you\u2019ll still be slicing and dicing monsters and enemies, protagonist Im\u00eb combines her spells and weapon combos with the ability to revert time and do it all over again, differently. The second time around, her shadow from the previous timeline will continue to rush into the enemies. If you remember the faded-out ghosts in racing games like <em>Mario Kart and Gran Turismo, </em>it\u2019s a little like those, but in a collaborative, not competitive, way.</p><p>The aim is to complete separated combat levels within a single \u2018run\u2019, with only a finite number of ghost-Im\u00ebs to get the job done. Naturally, things are further complicated by enemies that can\u2019t be defeated from the front, or paired monsters that have to be killed almost simultaneously or they\u2019ll respawn each other. Another Engadget editor said it reminded them of <em>Transistor</em> \u2013 the game rewards careful planning of your moves. While I was able to rush some of the early encounters without too much thinking, later levels demanded careful route planning, with doors that would lock and unlock when my character (or her ghosts) rushed through them, exploding enemies that could be punted into other enemies and a constant countdown that meant, sometimes, there wasn\u2019t enough time to think.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Fortunately, <em>Lysfanga</em>'s short levels \u2013 most can be completed in under two minutes \u2013 can be restarted. (Sometimes I knew I messed up, seconds into a level.) Im\u00eb also has an array of spells and special attacks with cooldown timers, to add further fight options. Controls are relatively simple, with two melee attack buttons that can be comboed together, a button to launch spells, a dash button that works for avoiding attacks and jumping across gaps, a rewind trigger for your time-twisting powers and a button for your ultimate attack.</p><p>According to the trailer, there will be a variety of weapon loadouts to suit different approaches, like long-reaching spears and speedy chakram blades. You\u2019ll also be able to unleash a super attack that not only does heavy damage to enemies nearby but is also echoed in your doppelgangers.</p><p>While some action-game prowess helps, you\u2019ll only beat most levels by thinking them through before you act. The controls and play style aren\u2019t remotely similar, but <em>Lysfanga</em> reminded me of old Fire Emblem<em>&nbsp;</em>games, where careful planning decided a fight before it even begins. Even in this early demo, the game offers some incredibly satisfying moments when all your attacking clones come together to wipe out all the enemies in mere seconds. Each level can be replayed at markers across the game, and includes a more challenging time limit to beat, if you thought it was too easy first time around.</p><p>Along with <em>Under The Waves</em>, the game is one of the first titles from Quantic Dreams' new <a href=\"https://blog.quanticdream.com/spotlight-by-quantic-dream-2/\">Spotlight publishing arm</a>. <em>Lysfanga </em>will launch later this year on PC, through both Steam and Epic Games.</p><div id=\"fd73ec77221943beb38d63516f022b52\"></div><p><em>Catch up on all of the news from Summer Game Fest </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/sgf-2023\"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/lysfanga-hands-on-impressions-sgf-2023-130004741.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/lysfanga-hands-on-impressions-sgf-2023-130004741.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-10 13:00:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Microsoft adds AI voice chat to Bing on desktop", "description": "<p>You can now talk to Bing on desktop, and it can even read its replies to you out loud.
