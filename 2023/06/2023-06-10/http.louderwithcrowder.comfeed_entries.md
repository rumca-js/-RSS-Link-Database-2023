Spoiler: We WERE looking! And Joe Biden's brain looks like it is now 69% tapioca. But first, the hot new anti-Biden song that is blowing up the Twitters!</p><p>I don't know who this guy is. And my money is on him being less a based dude as much as a disgruntled Democrat. Still, I need a full-length song and music video right f*cking now!</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cThe lyrics to this anti-Biden song aren't that complicated, but neither is Beyonce's "Run the World (Girls)."\u201d</div> — Louder with Crowder Dot Com (@Louder with Crowder Dot Com)

<p>It has a catchy beat that brings as much energy as a Joe Biden speech. And while the lyrics aren't that complicated, neither is  Beyonce's "Run the World (Girls)."</p><blockquote>They're really gonna make me vote for Joe Biden.<br />Joe Biden.<br />How is the best-case scenario Joe Biden?<br />J-J-J-Joe Biden.<br />You're really gonna make me vote for Joe Biden.<br />How is the best-case scenario Joe Biden?</blockquote><p>I lost it when my man started to do The Floss. Though methinks there might be complaints about cultural appreciation.

<p>Yes, "they" are going to make you vote for Joe Biden. And they are going to make you hate yourself for it every step of the way.</p><p>Or, and this is something off the top of my head, you could always NOT vote for Joe Biden. This is an option too.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Garth Brooks appears to side with Bud Light: "If you’re an a**hole, there are plenty of other places"

The "Friends In Low Places Bar & Honky Tonk" to be specific. And there's an important question. It's not what live acts will be performing or whether or not wife (and Food Network star) Trish Yearwood is designing the menu. The important question is whether or not the bar will serve Bud Light.</p><p>As you may have heard, <a href="https://notthebee.com/article/the-bud-light-boycott-has-dethroned-it-from-the-top-of-the-us-beer-market-modelo-especial-has-taken-its-place" target="_blank">the now #2 beer in America</a> has been embroiled in controversy. And Garth has taken a side. Kinda.</p><h3>What did Garth Brooks say about Bud Light?</h3><br /><p>Brooks did not say the words "Bud Light" directly. But in an interview with Billboard that included <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/country/garth-brooks-country-live-panel-nashville-interview-melinda-newman-1235348128/" target="_blank">"How His Nashville Bar Will Serve ‘Every Brand Of Beer’</a> in the title, it's clear what's being implied.</p><p>Garth says he doesn't want to sound corny, but he wants his new venture to be the Chick-fil-A of honky-tonks. Adding, <em>"I want it to be a place you feel safe in, I want it to be a place where you feel like there are manners, and people like one another. And yes, we’re going to serve every brand of beer. We just are. It’s not our decision to make. Our thing is this, if you [are let] into this house, love one another. If you’re an a–hole, there are plenty of other places on lower Broadway."</em></p><p>He gave a politician's answer.</p><h3>What about other country artists?</h3><br /><p>Other country music artists have been very outspoken over the Bud Light controversy. John Rich (the man responsible for me being a country music fan) was one of the first to announce he <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11960843/John-Rich-PULLS-Bud-Light-popular-Redneck-Riviera-bar-amid-Dylan-Mulvaney-controversy.html" target="_blank">won't be selling the beer in his Redneck Riviera restaurant</a> after the company sold out to woke politics.</p><p>Same as Kid Rock. Only <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kid-rock-bud-light" target="_blank">he also used a visual aid (and a gun) to illustrate his disapproval</a> of the matter.</p><p>Other artists, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-brantley-gilbert" target="_blank">like Brantley Gilbert</a>, have rejected the beer on stage to the sounds of thunderous applause.</p><p><br /></p><p>I will never say an unkind word about Garth Brooks. I mean, he's Garth Brooks. He could have shotgunned a beer with Dylan Mulvaney on stage, and I would still convince myself it was Chris Gaines doing it and not him. Brooks should serve whatever beer he wants in his restaurant.</p><p>He just may find <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/clay-travis-beer-experiment" target="_blank">a lot of Bud Light left over</a> at the end of the night.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Woke prof brags about failing student over saying "biological female," cites transphobia, white supremacy as an excuse

Now, her gender studies professor is speaking out to give her -- I think "her" -- side of the story.</p><p>Melanie Rose Nipper, adjunct professor of sexuality studies at UoC, brags you're goddamned right she gave the student a zero grade. The professor's personal belief is that "biological woman" is bigoted towards "transgender women." If a student wants a passing grade, those personal beliefs must be affirmed.</p><p>Note: The student's project was on "transgender" women competing against "biological" women in sports.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<h3>You're talking about the video with the blonde, right?</h3><br /><p>
	Olivia Krolczyk went viral for this video discussing her failing grade:
</p><div class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" style="display: flex; width: 100%; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"></div> <blockquote>
	I 100% know this is the most biased grade ever because my project is about transgenders competing in biological women's sports. How am I supposed to do my project if I can't use the phrase "biological women?"
</blockquote><p>That is an excellent question because this is not the first time this has come up. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/trans-sports-university-research" target="_blank">A researcher had his study on if girls who were born biologically male</a> have an unfair advantage over regular girls rejected over the use of the words "male" and "female." <em></em></p><blockquote><em>I submitted a proposal for ethical review at Kings College London which stated that the aim of the research was “to find the views of athletes and volunteers on the question of when males should be allowed to compete in the female category in athletics”. The ethics committee rejected the proposal, on the grounds that using the terms “male” and “female” in this sentence constituted “misgendering”.</em></blockquote><p>In 2021, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/matt-walsh-lia-thomas-teammate" target="_blank">a teammate of mediocre male swimmer turned NCAA champion girl swimmer Lia Thomas</a> was asked to write an OpEd on the topic for the student newspaper. Then she had that OpEd edited to within an inch of its life. Then the newspaper retracted the OpEd when students complained an opposing viewpoint was being expressed.</p><p>So to answer Olivia's question, you are NOT supposed to write on the topic.</p><h3>Golly, this professor seems nice</h3><br /><p>Once Olivia became a popular figure in the pro-woman conservative media, <a href="https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/2023/06/08/olivia-krolczyk-professor-university-cincinnati-assignment-failed-women-studies/70295104007/" target="_blank">corporate media content provider The Cincinnati Inquirer</a> tracked down Melanie Rose Nipper. Nipper, faced with a complaint that Olivia's free speech is being compromised, wanted it known that she supports free speech. Providing, she agrees with the speech.</p><blockquote>Although Nipper said she agrees classrooms should be places for debate and discussion, that ends when "you are, intentionally or unintentionally, participating in a systemic harm of some kind." She cited transphobia and white supremacy as examples.</blockquote><blockquote>Similar incidents had occurred in the past, said Nipper, who has taught at UC since 2021. When a student uses "an outdated terminology," Nipper said she feels it is necessary to correct those mistakes.</blockquote><p>In fairness, Nipper says she will happily regrade the assignment. It would just require Olivia using words that the adjunct professor likes. As of this writing, it is unclear if the student will take her up on the offer.</p>
