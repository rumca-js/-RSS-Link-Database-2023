In part one of our recap of the entire Mortal Kombat series, we dove deep into the franchise's lore and the thousands of years that lead up to the first game, before then moving on to talk about the events of the original Mortal Kombat itself, which saw Liu Kang defeating Goro and Shang Tsung in the tournament to protect Earthrealm from being invaded and merged by the forces of Outworld and Shao Kahn.

In part, two we're going to talk about the next two mainline games in the series. But before we do that, we're going to pause and go back so we can lay the groundwork for the personal arcs of two particular characters- Scorpion and Sub-Zero, who are, in many ways, the faces of the Mortal Kombat franchise.
