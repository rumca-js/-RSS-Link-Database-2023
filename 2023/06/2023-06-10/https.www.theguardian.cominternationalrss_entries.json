Perhaps that\u2019s why wellness is a word that\u2019s still taboo among many men, particularly those from more traditional, working-class backgrounds.</p><p>Aside from a dilution of the term by fads and crazes, such as the ones listed above and those floating around on TikTok and Instagram, another issue may be a lack of retreats for men. We\u2019re not talking the Ant Middleton-style \u201cman-up or go home\u201d military fitness camps, nor Wim Hof woo-woo, just solid, safe spaces for men to talk, improve physical and mental wellbeing and escape the pressures of everyday life to develop meaningful connections. Thankfully, there are some pioneers leading the way in male wellness, ranging from hiking escapes in Snowdonia and breathwork getaways in southern Spain to a GBTQ pop-up retreat in Europe, promoting communication and emotional connection.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/jun/10/five-best-male-only-wellness-camps-in-europe-from-surfing-to-self-discovery\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/jun/10/five-best-male-only-wellness-camps-in-europe-from-surfing-to-self-discovery", "date_published": "2023-06-10 10:00:19+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "I re-read my teenage diaries hoping for a dose of nostalgia \u2013 instead I was horrified", "description": "<p>Lust, cruelty and a desperate need for attention ...

Yes. Would you like to watch a weird cosplay version of them that goes on for 10 hours and confusingly reshuffles the plot? Um, not really. The Full Monty (from 14 June, Disney+) is the latest entrant in an already tired genre, but it has one up on most of the competition: all the core cast are in that sweet spot where they\u2019re successful enough to be worth rehiring but not so famous they\u2019ve turned the reboot down. That means there\u2019s no need to rejig the story of redundant Sheffield steelworkers who, in 1997, found solace in hard times by forming a Chippendales-style male striptease troupe. We simply return to Sheffield 26 years later, to find the same characters, played by the same actors, living the same lives.</p><p>The film had it easy, plot-wise, in that it built towards that heartwarming climactic moment when a sextet of men showed the local community their penises. Those six appendages were the pegs on which were hung serious subtexts about the misery of life in a Thatcher-ravaged, deindustrialised northern England. A quarter of a century on, however, the prospect of the old boys windmilling their hosepipes in housewives\u2019 faces would horrify everyone. So the new Full Monty is fully clothes-on.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/10/full-monty-disney-tv-review-simon-beaufoy-alice-nutter\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/10/full-monty-disney-tv-review-simon-beaufoy-alice-nutter", "date_published": "2023-06-10 06:00:16+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "Disco then shower at 33,000ft: Dubai hotelier launches \u00a310k-an-hour \u2018party jet\u2019", "description": "<p>Plane can accommodate up to 16 people and is aimed at super-rich who \u2018want to enjoy the money while still alive\u2019</p><p>Forget partying on the ground: the super-rich are being told to do it at 33,000ft by a multimillionaire Dubai hotelier launching a \u00a310,000-an-hour \u201cfive-star party jet\u201d.</p><p>Kabir Mulchandani, the founder and chair of the luxury hotel group FIVE, has bought a Airbus ACJ TwoTwenty and claims to have transformed it into a \u201cboundary-breaking fusion of hospitality and private aviation\u201d, complete with dancing area, king-size bed and shower.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2023/jun/10/dubai-hotelier-launches-10k-an-hour-party-jet-shower-disco\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2023/jun/10/dubai-hotelier-launches-10k-an-hour-party-jet-shower-disco", "date_published": "2023-06-10 06:00:16+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "What links Harlem Nights and Night of the Hunter?
