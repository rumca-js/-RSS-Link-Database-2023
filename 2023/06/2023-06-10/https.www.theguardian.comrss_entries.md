<p>Substitute gives Manchester City something they lacked and starts the move that led to Rodri’s winner against Inter</p><p>It felt fitting, in the end, that Phil Foden should have a decisive hand. On a taught, sweaty, occasionally indigestible night at the Ataturk Olympic Stadium Manchester City finally turned the whole world a shade of sky blue, reaching the end point, the final high, of this extraordinary 15-year football-industrial project.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/10/rodri-breaks-internazionale-resistance-to-seal-manchester-citys-treble-glory">City are champions of Europe</a>. If this always seemed inevitable in the abstract, it still feels like moment of double-take, of pure sporting vertigo. A team playing in the same clothes as the one that seemed for so long the embodiment of gallows humour, familiar underachievement, a roll of the eyes in human form, are now indisputably, and by some distance judged on the season as a whole, the greatest football team on the planet.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jun/10/manchester-city-champions-league-final-phil-foden-provided-energy-and-precision-as-classic-pep-ball-prevailed">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Cargo pants are back with a bang. And it’s not just pants, but cargo everything – from skirts to shorts</p><p>If you remember them from the 90s, you will recall that they were a favourite look for girl band All Saints and Gwen Stefani. Fast forward to SS23 and cargo pants have become a staple in the wardrobes of Gigi and Bella Hadid, Hailey Bieber and Rihanna. Runway highlights include Fendi’s peach satin version (translated by Zara into black satin at a fraction of the price (5, below); and Givenchy (left) where Matthew M Williams showed chic short cargo pants in khaki denim and bouclé.</p><p>The high street has jumped on the trend. Head to Marks &amp; Spencer for a multitude of colours (1, below). Choose ultra-casual oversized khaki styles at Topshop and Zara, through to jean versions at Monki or be office-ready with tailored designs at Mango, whose white linen pair (4, below), looks ultra chic styled with a light blue blazer. Me and Em’s wide-leg version (£165) can be dressed up with a silk cami or down with a white T-shirt or lightweight knit. With warmer weather on the way these versatile trousers are perfect to throw in your case for holidays, styled with anything from a bikini for day to embroidered blouse, kitten heels and beaded jewellery for cocktails at sunset. &amp; Other Stories has put its own spin on the traditional cut of combats with a straight-legged, high-waisted version (£135), while River Island’s abstract print ones, £39, look great with a cream blazer (10, below). Frankie Shop’s minimalist style with a wide-leg offers a smarter, but still slouchy look when styled with an oversized shirt (7, below). For preloved, search your local vintage, charity shops or vinted.com, try the men’s section, then cinch the waist with a plaited belt and roll up the legs, add a colourful trainer and you’re ready to go.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jun/10/practically-perfect-you-cant-beat-cargo-when-it-comes-to-utility-and-style">Continue reading...</a>

## Guardiola vindicated as Stones thrives in ‘Barnsley Beckenbauer’ role  | Jonathan Wilson

<p>Some tactical tweaks are not overthinking – they’re just thinking, and the Manchester City manager’s decisions paid off</p><p>Not all tactical tweaks are the result of overthinking. Pep Guardiola did not simply pick the obvious starting XI. He did not pick the starting lineup that had propelled City through the Premier League run-in. He is criticised readily enough when he makes changes and City don’t win; this was an occasion when the change paid off. Guardiola made the necessary adjustment, and was rewarded with his third Champions League.</p><p>Until mid-February City, by their own remarkable standards, had not had a particularly great season. There were questions – entirely reasonable questions for all the subsequent sneering – about what Erling Haaland did to the balance of the side. When a player doesn’t involve himself in the play, when he has only 20-30 touches in a game as standard, how can he contribute to the maintenance of possession that is so necessary to providing the control that Guardiola prioritises? Yet Haaland, obviously, is a magnificent goalscorer and offers a major threat on the counter.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jun/10/manchester-city-champions-league-guardiola-vindicated-as-stones-thrives-in-barnsley-beckenbauer-role">Continue reading...</a>

## Cummins’ lack of intent shows sharp contrast of styles before Ashes | Andy Bull

<p>Idling tempo while batting in World Test Championship against India felt unfamiliar compared with Stokes’ all-action approach</p><p>Lunchtime at the Oval, and Australia are six wickets down with a lead of 373. Alex Carey’s at one end, 41 not out off 61 balls, Mitchell Starc’s at the other, 11 off 19. It’s already over a hundred runs more than anyone’s ever scored in the fourth innings to win a Test here, and that particular match was way back in the 1902 Ashes, when Gilbert Jessop blazed his 76-ball hundred. The pressing question then, the one everyone was chewing over in the food and drink queues, was: “What’s next?” A burst of attacking cricket, a tumble of tail-end wickets?</p><p>What we got, instead, was one of those soporific hours when play slows down to an amble. Starc threw the odd shot, a clip through midwicket for four, a punch down the ground for another, Carey tinkered around in singles. The crowd quietened down, the sun drifted overhead, aeroplanes came and went. Tick. A single off one over. Tock. A single off the next. Tick. Another single from the one after. Tock. In 10 overs, Australia scored all of 31 runs. The second hand wavered, even seemed to be moving backwards.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jun/10/cummins-lack-of-intent-shows-sharp-contrast-of-styles-before-ashes-duel">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The champion lost a set for the first time in this tournament but she knew how to drag herself out of a dangerous place</p><p>The man holding the camera leaned in towards Iga Swiatek. The man holding the pen held it out to her. The new French Open champion thought for a while about how to encapsulate her torrent of thoughts and emotions into a little glass square around the size of a Pop Tart. Eventually she scrawled a number – #4, for her fourth grand slam title – and a single word. “<em>Surréel.</em>”</p><p>And it really was surreal, or at least as about as surreal as it can ever be watching a habitual major champion win another major. For if the outcome was expected then virtually nothing else about this final was. It was one thing, and then suddenly it became a whole other thing: a regal procession that somehow morphed into a scrap for survival against the fearless and admirable Karolina Muchova, a match that dragged the world No 1 to places she had never been before, places she never wanted to go.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jun/10/iga-swiateks-cold-logic-makes-sure-french-open-trophy-is-in-safe-hands">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Across the west, popular misery and ‘elite overproduction’ are fuelling crisis, argues data-driven historian Peter Turchin. So what can we do to turn things around?</p><p>In February 2010, Peter Turchin, a relatively obscure researcher at the University of Connecticut, wrote a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/463608a" title="">letter</a> to the distinguished journal Nature. He was responding to their “2020 visions” issue – an upbeat dawn-of-the-decade exercise that collected predictions of progress from across science and politics. Turchin assumed the role of Cassandra. “The next decade is likely to be a period of growing instability in the United States and western Europe,” he wrote, “which could undermine the sort of scientific progress you describe.” He pointed to waves of disruption that tend to recur every 50 years. “All these cycles look set to peak in the years around 2020.” There was still time to change course, though: with measures to improve wellbeing and reduce economic inequality, “records show that societies can avert disaster”.</p><p>Normally scientists enjoy being proved right, but for Turchin, the way the following decade panned out must have seemed a bit too on-the-nose. The response to the financial crisis wasn’t a New Deal-style rescue package as he’d recommended, but austerity and a widening of the gap between rich and poor. Frustration at the established order threw up <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum" title="">Brexit </a>in Britain and Trump in the US. Right on cue, 2020 delivered a pandemic, economic chaos and a president who refused to concede defeat at the polls. The following January saw the storming of the Capitol, and images of insurrection that seemed like a throwback to an earlier revolutionary era.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/10/how-to-avoid-a-civil-war-by-the-man-who-predicted-trump">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I owe my happiness to the queer friends I made. And to my younger self who hated being gay: all is forgiven</p><p>I was lying awake the other night, thinking about death, when I realised something big. Of all the things I could be reincarnated as – a tapeworm, a dung beetle, a writer (again) – the thing I most fear is coming back as straight. Honestly, the idea sends a shiver down my spine. Because, no disrespect to my straight friends, but I don’t know how they get through the day. Straight women, in particular. I don’t understand how they go through life, dealing with the whole power dynamic in opposite-sex relationships, without even the option of dating other women. I don’t think I could hack it, and they have my utmost respect.</p><p>It’s not just the romantic side of things, though – over the years, being gay has shifted my entire worldview. It’s made me think twice about every social norm, from the nuclear family to uncomfortable footwear. And I’m not saying that all straight people lack the imagination to challenge these things too, but being gay really helps. Recently, it dawned on me that I’m perfectly within my right to shop for clothes in the men’s section, and that in itself has been a revelation. Again, I know straight women who do this. But when it comes to wearing “men’s” clothes with any real ease and confidence, being a lesbian just <em>helps</em>.</p><p>Eleanor Margolis is a columnist for the i newspaper and Diva</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/10/fall-in-love-gay-happiness-queer-friends">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Harlech, Gwynedd:</strong> At the boundary of a wood I find some hemlock water dropwort, of which every part is poisonous</p><p>The path climbs slate steps before slanting left through oakwoods alive with the song of warblers. Green caterpillars wriggle in flycatchers’ bills (less effort to catch than flies, I suppose). Clouds of midges dance in shafts of sunlight. A long climbing traverse with views of Yr Wyddfa lures you on, takes you to the wood’s boundary. I lean against a wall, look around, and down to my right in a moist ditch see a plant of which all who venture into the Welsh countryside should be very wary.</p><p>It’s an umbellifer, less tall than hogweed. I check out crucial detail. White flower-clusters are already present. Stems are hairless and hollow, lacking purple blotches low down that would identify this specimen as <em>Conium maculatum</em> (hemlock). It’s <em>Oenanthe crocata</em> – hemlock water dropwort, deadliest of all British plants, every part of it very poisonous. A member of the carrot family, it has pale, tuberous roots – dead man’s finger. Foragers beware!</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/10/country-diary-the-carrot-cousin-thats-pretty-but-deadly">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With only a fortnight left of feijoa season in Australia, enthusiasts are snapping up the green-skinned fruits – if they can find them</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=cvau_sfl">Get our weekend culture and lifestyle email</a></li></ul><p>Apples and oranges are the lowest hanging fruit during Australia’s autumn and winter. But this time of year is also the short, sweet season for a far more obscure crop: feijoa. The fruit, native to South America, has a green skin, an oval shape and sweet-tangy flesh that is beloved by those in the know, including New Zealanders – feijoa season is highly anticipated across the Tasman.</p><p>Feijoa (pronounced fay-joh-uh) grows well in Victoria, Tasmania, New South Wales, and the Adelaide Hills in South Australia. There are approximately two weeks remaining for this year’s season, with supply expected to come primarily from Western Australia.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/10/from-ornamental-tree-to-fruit-of-the-gods-australians-discover-the-joy-of-feijoa">Continue reading...</a>
