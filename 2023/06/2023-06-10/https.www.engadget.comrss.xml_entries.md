<p>After arriving on PC in the fall of 2021, <a href="https://www.unpackinggame.com/"><em><ins>Unpacking</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>is finally heading to mobile devices. Developer Witch Beam Games revealed today during the <a href="https://youtu.be/hHPF2g1HyLs"><ins>Wholesome Direct</ins></a> showcase that it plans to release its breakout game on phones and tablets later this year. The studio didn’t say exactly when the title would arrive on mobile devices, nor if it plans to release <em>Unpacking</em> on both iOS and Android, but judging from the trailer it shared, Apple devices are a lock.</p><div id="8598c679ee6f43bcb770b1b84ee83b74"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Hope you all were paying attention during <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WholesomeDirect?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WholesomeDirect</a>, because we had a pretty big announcement—that’s right, ✨ UNPACKING IS COMING TO PHONES AND TABLETS!! ✨ We can’t wait for you all to experience it and take Unpacking with you on the go later this year! 📦 🔜 📱 <a href="https://t.co/Y1tEr3vlnZ">pic.twitter.com/Y1tEr3vlnZ</a></p>— Unpacking 📦 plushies AVAILABLE now!

<p>Canon has long been synonymous with traditional photography, but the company could be preparing to take a more definitive step into the world of virtual reality. At the Photo Next 2023 show in Japan, the company showed off a prototype convertible camera. The unnamed device features a nifty folding mechanism that allows it to capture both 360-degree video and 180-degree 3D content. As a handful of websites, including <a href="https://petapixel.com/2023/06/09/new-canon-360-and-180-vr-camera-spotted-at-photo-fair-in-japan/"><em><ins>PetaPixel</ins></em></a> and <a href="https://www.diyphotography.net/canon-shows-off-a-new-fold-out-180-360-vr-camera-at-photonext-2023/"><em><ins>DIY Photography</ins></em></a>, have noted, the prototype bears more than a passing resemblance to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-13-insta360-evo-180-3d-360-camera.html"><ins>Insta360 EVO</ins></a>, which also makes use of a folding mechanism to offer 180-degree 3D capture. According to <a href="https://en.pronews.com/column/2023060714203872.html"><em><ins>Pronews</ins></em></a>, Canon did not share any details on specs, pricing or availability.</p><div id="8e01fc89ffab48c29322c9063b37c3a9"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="ja">PHOTO NEXT 2023のキヤノンブースで展示されている<br />Canon PowerShot Vシリーズのコンセプトカメラ<br />360°＆180° 3D VR Camera<br />表裏にレンズが付いていて、360°カメラとして使えるし、広げてヒラメにすると180°VRカメラになるそうです。<br />詳細は非公開です。 <a href="https://t.co/STHjBGxLCM">pic.twitter.com/STHjBGxLCM</a></p>— Ichiro Uematsu (@IchiroYqz01403) <a href="https://twitter.com/IchiroYqz01403/status/1666013051253055488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 6, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>Canon has previously only dabbled with virtual reality.

The camera Canon teased at Photo Next features the company’s V branding, which it typically reserves for consumer-facing products. That would suggest Canon could be ready to take VR more seriously. While the company has sometimes been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/why-nikon-and-canon-have-given-up-on-dsl-rs-133042286.html"><ins>slow to embrace new technologies</ins></a>, Canon’s usual slow pace could work in its favor this time around.

## ‘Mortal Kombat 1’ made a great first impression at SGF 2023

<p>One of the biggest reveals from a generally muted SGF showcase was gameplay footage from<em> Mortal Kombat 1. </em>Technically the 12th mainline game restarts the entire universe. Liu Kang, once mortal, is now a fully-fledged god of fire, and he’s rerolled the realm.</p><p>This means fan favorites like Sub Zero and Scorpion are back, but <em>now,</em> they’re siblings. The development team has decided to shake up the plot and reinvent characters for this 2023 reboot. Alongside this new world and character dynamics, <em>MK1</em> also introduces a new feature to fights in the form of Kameos. After choosing a character, you’re able to select a guest fighter to back you up during the fight. Summonable by a single button (R1 on PlayStation), you can combine it with back and forward inputs to trigger multiple different moves. There are also Kameo throws and fatalities, all-in-all adding more versatility and flexibility in fights. Want to make sure you can block a character’s jump attacks? Get Jax on deck so he can suplex them to the floor. Need to match a projectile-flinging character? Summon Sonya.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We got to play with four different characters (and a trio of ‘Kameo’ assistants), trying out several different combinations and trying to see all the Kameo fatalities we could. Engadget’s <a href="mailto:brandon.quintana@engadget.com"><ins>Brandon Quintana</ins></a> is a long-standing <em>MK</em> fan. He lays out why the game delivers on what he wanted – while thrashing me in the process. <em>Mortal Kombat 1 </em>will launch this September 19th, 2023 on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X and S.</p><div id="52029d696ad2438eaf63d5503274004c"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p><em>Catch up on all of the news from Summer Game Fest </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/sgf-2023"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mortal-kombat-1-first-impressions-sgf-2023-180039676.html?src=rss

## Google's Pixel 8 Pro could feature a larger, more capable main camera sensor

<p>The Pixel 8 and 8 Pro could feature some notable camera upgrades. Writing for <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-8-camera-leak-3333575/"><em><ins>Android Authority</ins></em></a>, leaker Kamila Wojciechowska, who has a solid record when it comes to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/leaked-pixel-fold-video-shows-an-internal-display-with-chunky-bezels-164425413.html"><ins>Pixel leaks</ins></a>, says Google's next pair of high-end phones will feature Samsung ISOCELL GN2 sensors. That's the same sensor found on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s-22-review-sprucing-up-a-solid-foundation-151522033.html"><ins>Galaxy S22</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s23-review-a-solid-phone-thats-probably-not-worth-the-upgrade-173026346.html"><ins>S23</ins></a>. More notably, it's a significant upgrade over the ISOCELL GN1 Google has used since the Pixel 6. The GN2 is physically larger and capable of capturing 35 percent more light than its predecessor, making it a better low-light performer. It also supports more modern features, including 8K/30 fps video capture and Staggered HDR. Google could use the latter to reduce ghosting in HDR images.</p><p>According to Wojciechowska, both the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro will come with the GN2. However, Google's flagship will also reportedly pack a few exclusive upgrades. The Pixel 8 Pro will feature a new time-of-flight sensor that should improve autofocus performance and, more significantly, a more modern sensor for its ultra-wide camera. Google reportedly plans to use the 64-megapixel Sony IMX787, the same sensor that powers the Pixel 7a's primary camera, to replace the Pixel 7 Pro's aging 12-megapixel IMX386. The former is almost twice the size of its predecessor and should produce much better images. Wojciechowska notes the version of the Pixel 8 Pro Google is currently testing doesn't come with a macro mode, though they suggest that doesn't mean the final version won't ship with that feature. The Pixel 8 will continue to use the IMX386 but may offer a lens with a wider field of view for those who want to capture more of a scene at once. Wojciechowska says the selfie and telephoto cameras on the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro are unchanged from those on the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro. Lastly, they note the Pixel 8 Pro's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/googles-pixel-8-pro-could-have-a-built-in-thermometer-114808668.html"><ins>rumored thermometer sensor</ins></a> won't be used for photography.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Naturally, Google also has software upgrades planned. The company will reportedly update its camera app to allow Pixel users to decide how strong the bokeh effect is when using the &quot;Cinematic&quot; video mode. Additionally, a new &quot;Adaptive torch&quot; feature may dynamically adjust the output of a phone's flash module to prevent it from overexposing images.</p><p>Considering Google has had a history of sticking with the same camera sensor for multiple Pixel generations, it's encouraging to learn the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro could feature new, more capable camera hardware. Google has done a lot with its computational software, but there are only so many visual enhancements you can squeeze out of a camera sensor without going for a bigger one.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/googles-pixel-8-pro-could-feature-a-larger-more-capable-main-camera-sensor-163235885.html?src=rss

## ‘Lysfanga’ is what happens when hack-and-slash meets tactical time travel
 - [https://www.engadget.com/lysfanga-hands-on-impressions-sgf-2023-130004741.html?src=rss](https://www.engadget.com/lysfanga-hands-on-impressions-sgf-2023-130004741.html?src=rss)

<p><em>Lysfanga</em>’s isometric views may conjure up memories of Hades, but this is a different kind of game. While you’ll still be slicing and dicing monsters and enemies, protagonist Imë combines her spells and weapon combos with the ability to revert time and do it all over again, differently. The second time around, her shadow from the previous timeline will continue to rush into the enemies. If you remember the faded-out ghosts in racing games like <em>Mario Kart and Gran Turismo, </em>it’s a little like those, but in a collaborative, not competitive, way.</p><p>The aim is to complete separated combat levels within a single ‘run’, with only a finite number of ghost-Imës to get the job done. Naturally, things are further complicated by enemies that can’t be defeated from the front, or paired monsters that have to be killed almost simultaneously or they’ll respawn each other. Another Engadget editor said it reminded them of <em>Transistor</em> – the game rewards careful planning of your moves. While I was able to rush some of the early encounters without too much thinking, later levels demanded careful route planning, with doors that would lock and unlock when my character (or her ghosts) rushed through them, exploding enemies that could be punted into other enemies and a constant countdown that meant, sometimes, there wasn’t enough time to think.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Fortunately, <em>Lysfanga</em>'s short levels – most can be completed in under two minutes – can be restarted. (Sometimes I knew I messed up, seconds into a level.) Imë also has an array of spells and special attacks with cooldown timers, to add further fight options. Controls are relatively simple, with two melee attack buttons that can be comboed together, a button to launch spells, a dash button that works for avoiding attacks and jumping across gaps, a rewind trigger for your time-twisting powers and a button for your ultimate attack.</p><p>According to the trailer, there will be a variety of weapon loadouts to suit different approaches, like long-reaching spears and speedy chakram blades. You’ll also be able to unleash a super attack that not only does heavy damage to enemies nearby but is also echoed in your doppelgangers.</p><p>While some action-game prowess helps, you’ll only beat most levels by thinking them through before you act. The controls and play style aren’t remotely similar, but <em>Lysfanga</em> reminded me of old Fire Emblem<em>&nbsp;</em>games, where careful planning decided a fight before it even begins. Even in this early demo, the game offers some incredibly satisfying moments when all your attacking clones come together to wipe out all the enemies in mere seconds. Each level can be replayed at markers across the game, and includes a more challenging time limit to beat, if you thought it was too easy first time around.</p><p>Along with <em>Under The Waves</em>, the game is one of the first titles from Quantic Dreams' new <a href="https://blog.quanticdream.com/spotlight-by-quantic-dream-2/">Spotlight publishing arm</a>. <em>Lysfanga </em>will launch later this year on PC, through both Steam and Epic Games.</p><div id="fd73ec77221943beb38d63516f022b52"></div><p><em>Catch up on all of the news from Summer Game Fest </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/sgf-2023"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/lysfanga-hands-on-impressions-sgf-2023-130004741.html?src=rss
