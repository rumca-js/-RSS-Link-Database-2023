Johnson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/09/it-is-sad-to-be-leaving-for-now-boris-johnsons-resignation-statement-in-full\">statement</a> announcing he will quit the Commons is not brief \u2013 more than 1,000 words \u2013 and, as ever with the former prime minister\u2019s pronouncements, there is a lot of often barely hidden subtext:</p><p>I have received a letter from the privileges committee making it clear \u2013 much to my amazement \u2013 that they are determined to use the proceedings against me to drive me out of parliament.</p><p><strong>They have still not produced a shred of evidence that I knowingly or recklessly misled the Commons.</strong></p><p>They know perfectly well that when I spoke in the Commons I was saying what I believed sincerely to be true and what I had been briefed to say, like any other minister.</p><p>They know that I corrected the record as soon as possible; and they know that I and every other senior official and minister \u2013 including the current prime minister and then occupant of the same building, Rishi Sunak \u2013 believed that we were working lawfully together.</p><p>Most members of the committee \u2013 especially the chair \u2013 had already expressed deeply prejudicial remarks about my guilt before they had even seen the evidence. They should have recused themselves.</p><p><strong>In retrospect it was naive and trusting of me to think that these proceedings could be remotely useful or fair. But I was determined to believe in the system, and in justice, and to vindicate what I knew to be the truth.</strong></p><p>It was the same faith in the impartiality of our systems that led me to commission Sue Gray. It is clear that my faith has been misplaced. Of course, it suits the Labour party, the Liberal Democrats, and the SNP to do whatever they can to remove me from parliament.</p><p>Sadly, as we saw in July last year, there are currently some Tory MPs who share that view. <strong>I am not alone in thinking that there is a witch-hunt under way, to take revenge for Brexit and ultimately to reverse the 2016 referendum result.</strong></p><p><strong>My removal is the necessary first step, and I believe there has been a concerted attempt to bring it about. I am afraid I no longer believe that it is any coincidence that Sue Gray \u2013 who investigated gatherings in </strong><strong>No 10 \u2013 is now the chief of staff designate of the Labour leader.</strong></p><p><strong>Nor do I believe that it is any coincidence that her supposedly impartial chief counsel, Daniel Stilitz KC, turned out to be a strong Labour supporter who repeatedly tweeted personal attacks on me and the government.</strong></p><p><strong>When I left office last year the government was only a handful of points behind in the polls. That gap has now massively widened.</strong></p><p>Just a few years after winning the biggest majority in almost half a century, that majority is now clearly at risk.</p><p>Our party needs urgently to recapture its sense of momentum and its belief in what this country can do.</p><p>We need to deliver on the 2019 manifesto, which was endorsed by 14 million people. We should remember that more than 17 million voted for Brexit.</p><p><strong>I am now being forced out of parliament by a tiny handful of people, with no evidence to back up their assertions, and without the approval even of Conservative party members let alone the wider electorate.</strong></p><p>The Conservative party has the time to recover its mojo and its ambition and to win the next election.</p><p><strong>I had looked forward to providing enthusiastic support as a backbench MP. Harriet Harman\u2019s committee has set out to make that objective completely untenable.</strong></p><p>The committee\u2019s report is riddled with inaccuracies and reeks of prejudice but under their absurd and unjust process I have no formal ability to challenge anything they say.</p><p>The privileges committee is there to protect the privileges of parliament. That is a very important job. They should not be using their powers \u2013 which have only been very recently designed \u2013 to mount what is plainly a political hit-job on someone they oppose.</p><p>I am very sorry to leave my wonderful constituency. It has been a huge honour to serve them, both as mayor and MP.</p><p>But I am proud that after what is cumulatively a 15-year stint I have helped to deliver among other things a vast new railway in the Elizabeth line and full funding for a wonderful new state of the art hospital for Hillingdon, where enabling works have already begun.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/10/boris-johnson-resignation-statement-really-meant\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/10/boris-johnson-resignation-statement-really-meant", "date_published": "2023-06-10 09:43:10+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss", "title": "Greggs opens fourth shop in Cornwall but has no pasties on the menu", "description": "<p>Newcastle-based baker makes second attempt to win over Saltash after franchise store failed</p><p>Saying that feelings run high about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/greggs\">Greggs</a> in Cornwall is an understatement.
