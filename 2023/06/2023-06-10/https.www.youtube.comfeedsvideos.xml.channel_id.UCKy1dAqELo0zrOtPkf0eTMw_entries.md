## Greyhill Incident Review

Greyhill Incident reviewed by Travis Northup on PC.

The fact that this alien horror game so wholly mangles so many of the things it tries to pull off, from its story to its stealth, certainly feels like a conspiracy – and one the government should have done a better job of covering up. Whether it's trying to be ironic or scary, Greyhill Incident fails in either scenario, resulting in a tedious but mercifully short jaunt through cornfields and backwater abodes that’s about as fun as actually being probed by aliens.

## Peacock's New Twisted Metal Clip Is Remarkably Bad - IGN The Fix: Entertainment

We got a new clip from the upcoming Peacock series Twisted Metal and fans online don’t seem to be too happy with the upcoming Twisted Metal series’ direction. The major thing the extended Twisted Metal clip was missing was vehicular combat, as that has been a series staple for Twisted Metal. #TwistedMetal is a beloved franchise, and it’s rather odd to some fans for the public to receive a live-action series over a new entry into the Twisted Metal video game series. Plus we talk about Secret Invasion, Netflix subscriptions in the U.S. and more on today’s fix with Akeem Lawanson.

The Star Wars Galaxy is filled with bizarre characters and creatures, but it’s been a while since one saw such widespread fandom as Turgle, the frog-like guy (?) who hangs around Pyloon’s Saloon and has variou misadventures around the wilds of Koboh. Turgle is played buy Richard Horvitz, who’s already voiced one fan-favorite alien on Invader Zim, but what makes Turgle so special? We talked to game director Stig Asmussen about Turgle becoming an overnight sensation, and how the team at Respawn Entertainment feel about this hilarious creature.
