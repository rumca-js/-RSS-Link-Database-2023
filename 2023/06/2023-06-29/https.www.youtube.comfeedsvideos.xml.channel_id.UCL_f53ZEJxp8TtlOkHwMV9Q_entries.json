Peterson and Eric Metaxas discuss his most recent book, \u201cA Letter to the American Church,\u201d which argues a betrayal of faith by those who stay silent in the face of tyranny. They parallel the arbiters of speech across history against those populating today, and detail the responsibility to act against falsehood that is intrinsically present in the Abrahamic tradition, yet increasingly absent in the American church today.\n\nEric Metaxas is an American author, speaker, and radio host. He has written award winning biographies, such as \u201cBonhoeffer,\u201d as well as children's books like \u201cSquanto and the Miracle of Thanksgiving,\u201d Metaxas hosts Socrates in the City,  a recurring popular event where he interviews writers and thinkers on theology, moralism, and philosophy. He also hosts the nationally syndicated Eric Metaxas Show, more broadly referred to as \u201cThe Show About Everything.\u201d \n\nDr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8\n\n- Sponsors -\n\nHallow: Try Hallow for 3 months FREE: https://hallow.com/jordan\n\nExpressVPN:  Get 3 Months FREE of ExpressVPN: https://expressvpn.com/jordan\n\n\n- Links -\n\nFor Eric Metaxas:\n\nWebsite https://ericmetaxas.com/\n\nSocrates In the City (Event) https://socratesinthecity.com/\n\nA Letter to the American Church (Book) https://www.amazon.com/Letter-American-Church-Eric-Metaxas/dp/1684513898/ref=sr_1_1?hvadid=602214623177&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=9013184&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=452474498154066228&amp;hvtargid=kwd-1664146320895&amp;hydadcr=7659_11327319&amp;keywords=letter+to+the+american+church&amp;qid=1688062525&amp;sr=8-1 \n\nTwitter @Ericmetaxas https://twitter.com/ericmetaxas?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor \n\n\n- Chapters -\n\n(0:00) Coming up\n(0:20) Intro\n(1:17) Writing to Christians\n(7:53) Inspired versus instrumented\n(11:56) The higher path is present, if not visible\n(15:43) Those who arbitrate our speech and thought\n(21:08) Takedowns on Youtube, RFK Jr.\n(23:13) What\u2019s more despicable than the love of money?\n(26:54) When you should stake your claim\n(34:22) Martin Luther, speak what you believe to be true\n(38:57) How do you trust your own judgment in biblical matters?\n(39:57) The meaning behind \u201cdon\u2019t use the lord's name in vane\u201d\n(45:43) Cain and Abel, attempting to fool God\n(48:50) An insufficient sacrifice\n(51:10) New religion, same devil\n(55:14) Holding your tongue when you have something to say\n(57:58) The fathomless truth found in scripture\n(58:49) You are on the hook for your faith\n(1:01:06) When you know the truth and lie\n(1:02:24) Why Metaxas became a Christian\n(1:04:49) Symbolism in faith, dreams, and visions\n(1:13:44) How the acceptance of Christ changes you\n(1:17:18) The ultimate loser reigns in Hell\n(1:21:59) A positive response from the church\n(1:25:06) We are in a battle between good and evil\n(1:26:16) What victory will look like\n(1:28:37) You cannot remain silent and pretend you are faithful\n\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41elK59iygE", "date_published": "2023-06-29 18:32:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
