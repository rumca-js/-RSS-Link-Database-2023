But, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/hans-abrahamsen\">Hans Abrahamsen</a> puts it, his Left, Alone, first performed in 2016, was not written for a pianist with only one hand, but by \u201ca composer who can only play with one hand\u201d. Abrahamsen was born with restricted use of his right hand, and, though he played the piano from childhood, that limitation gave him \u201can alternative focus on the whole piano literature\u201d.</p><p>His long-held idea of writing a left-hand concerto came to fruition in Left, Alone. Formally, it\u2019s made up of a typical Abrahamsen sequence of short movements, six in all, which fall into two groups of three. The solo writing is largely melodic \u2013 there are few of the massive chords that Ravel conjures up in his Piano Concerto for the Left Hand, for instance \u2013 as the piano threads its lonely way through the typically glittering orchestral textures, almost oblivious to what surrounds it.
