<p>Windows Copilot is one part Bing, one part Windows. It&rsquo;s an assistant who can perform tasks for you one moment, but then pleads ignorance the next. Microsoft&rsquo;s AI assistant within Windows certainly has potential, but during my time with it, achieving a consistent experience was one of its unexpected challenges.</p>



<p>Windows Copilot, the migration of Microsoft&rsquo;s AI-powered Bing Chat into Windows, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1974561/microsoft-says-you-can-now-test-windows-copilot.html">debuted Thursday</a> as part of the latest Windows Insider build for the Dev Channel; <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1924008/windows-copilot-will-bring-ai-into-windows-11.html">Microsoft announced Copilot</a> at the end of May, with a promise to bring it into testing by the end of June. It&rsquo;s now here, though it hasn&rsquo;t reached its full potential yet.</p>



<p>To experience Copilot, you&rsquo;ll need to sign up for the Windows Insider Dev Channel, download the build, <em>and</em> make sure that Microsoft Edge is also updated to its latest version. If you don&rsquo;t see the small Windows Copilot icon resting to the left of the search icon/box on the Taskbar, that&rsquo;s most likely why. Otherwise, you can click the icon (or use the<strong> Windows + C</strong> shortcut), and Windows Copilot will slide out from the right-hand navigation pane as a vertical column for conversation.</p>



<p>Microsoft opened up the Bing Chat AI chatbot near the end of May, so you should be familiar with its basic structure: You can interact with Copilot a number of times (currently 30) before you have to start over and refresh the conversation. That&rsquo;s still the case with Windows Copilot. You can also interact with Copilot in a Creative, Balanced, or Precise voice, though it won&rsquo;t affect how Copilot performs PC-centric tasks.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows Copilot taskbar" class="wp-image-1974899" height="653" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Windows-Copilot-taskbar-basic.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">You&rsquo;ll find Windows Copilot here, on the Taskbar.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Ask Copilot a question and you&rsquo;ll sometimes receive additional suggestions for follow-up queries. On other occasions, you&rsquo;ll see some visually jarring maps and/or ads for local businesses, if your query addresses those. As with Bing Chat, Copilot will add footnoted links for follow-up queries. NSFW queries continue to be out of bounds.</p>



<p>But that&rsquo;s where some of the problems begin. Windows Copilot isn&rsquo;t Copilot; it self-identifies as Bing, and in doing so wanders back and forth between what it can do and what questions it can answer. This isn&rsquo;t a case of trying to force it to adopt the &ldquo;Sydney&rdquo; persona, which led to all sorts of unhinged conversations. Windows Copilot sometimes just isn&rsquo;t quite sure of what it is: a search engine, a chatbot, or a Windows assistant. The latter, however, is what&rsquo;s new.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 Copilot" class="wp-image-1974896" height="1200" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Edge-copilot-request.png?w=1174" width="1174" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Windows Copilot will ask to capture information from the active Edge window, such as summarizing the page.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Windows Copilot has been programmed to cut through all the clutter and menus, and to do what you tell it to do. So far, unfortunately, this has been limited to just a handful of actions, which include switching to light or dark mode, taking a screenshot, and little else. Phrasing occasionally matters, too: Just as some chatbots can be fooled into allowing an action or question by rephrasing it, Copilot refused to switch to light mode once when I phrased it poorly, though it then learned (?) and didn&rsquo;t repeat the mistake. </p>



<p>Advanced users probably won&rsquo;t see much value from this, as they can either navigate quickly to whatever submenu they need, use a shortcut, or find some other way of doing what they want. For the average user, though, this is extraordinary. Windows has always lacked a robust help function, and this is an opportunity to help users do what they want to do, full stop.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 Copilot" class="wp-image-1974895" height="1200" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Windows-Copilot-screenshot.png?w=437" width="437" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Windows Copilot can perform some tasks itself; for others it will have to tell you how to perform them yourself.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="windows-copilot-has-several-problems-to-solve">Windows Copilot has several problems to solve</h2>



<p>Copilot has potential, clearly, and we&rsquo;ll talk about that a bit later. But right now Copilot has at least two major issues.</p>



<p>Perhaps the most significant is how Microsoft will handle tasks. Microsoft doesn&rsquo;t distinguish between actual questions (&ldquo;what is heat?&rdquo;) and tasks (&ldquo;set my PC to dark mode&rdquo;) but it&rsquo;s clear there are certain things Windows Copilot <em>will</em> do, and many more it won&rsquo;t. This matters because users will inevitably find themselves in situations where Windows Copilot simply won&rsquo;t do what a user wants it to. </p>



<p>To its credit, I was impressed that Windows Copilot actually answered a question about using the Windows registry to modify the Windows 11 taskbar &mdash; but it didn&rsquo;t actually perform those modifications, and I&rsquo;m not sure it ever will. But it&rsquo;s hard to see how users won&rsquo;t be left ultimately unsatisfied by what Windows Copilot offers, especially if its &ldquo;magic&rdquo; is just limited to a handful of tasks.</p>



<p>Windows Copilot is also unsure of what it <em>can </em>do. I asked it for the local temperature and a forecast, and it correctly identified my location. But Copilot failed when I asked for a list of nearby lunch places, and suggested some restaurants in Austin instead of the Bay Area where I live. It&rsquo;s those discrepancies that may make perfect sense when seen in one context, but in another (<em>does Copilot know me, or not?</em>) is confusing and a trifle frustrating, too.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-future-could-be-bright">The future could be bright</h2>



<p>How successful Copilot ends up is in Microsoft&rsquo;s hands. Users are going to quickly expect Copilot to do the vast majority of the tasks they either can&rsquo;t do themselves or are unwilling to spend the time on. If Microsoft opens up Windows to allow this, Copilot will become a significant part of the Windows architecture. Will it be able to hook into apps? Perform backups? Query your PC for a file or files? Analyze CPU performance under load? The future is bright for Copilot as a platform, but it&rsquo;s not clear whether it will meet its potential.</p>



<p>Right now, however, Windows Copilot is just the Bing Chat robotic butler, helpfully answering questions and now holding a door open for you, too. To succeed, it must have more to offer.</p>

## Microsoft says you can now test Windows Copilot

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>Microsoft said Thursday that it has begun shipping its AI-powered Windows Copilot in a test build for Windows, along with a revised Settings menu that uses a card-based dashboard to allow users to make quick adjustments without needing to dive deeper.</p>



<p>Microsoft said it will ship Windows 11 Insider Build 23493 for the Dev Channel today, squeaking under its self-imposed deadline to ship Copilot by the end of June. Microsoft has said before that builds shipped into the Dev Channel may not ever see the light of day, but Copilot is almost certainly an exception.</p>



<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s latest build is a fairly major one, even excluding Copilot. The Settings revamp continues the work Microsoft has done to streamline how Settings displays information and allows users to control various aspects of their PC. The build also extends Microsoft&rsquo;s Restore features for setting up new PCs, enhances the volume mixer, and even takes Snap Layouts a bit further by offering suggestions on how app windows should fit together.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="windows-copilot-is-here">Windows Copilot is here</h2>



<p>The headline feature, of course, is <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1924008/windows-copilot-will-bring-ai-into-windows-11.html">Windows Copilot, which Microsoft announced</a> at the end of June. Part ChatGPT, part a Windows version of Siri or Google Assistant, Windows Copilot is designed to both answer questions as an AI as well as control your system without the need to dig through settings menus or control options. </p>



<p>However, some of our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1930286/heres-what-windows-copilot-can-do-according-to-microsoft.html">Windows Copilot predictions</a> have come true, while others haven&rsquo;t. Microsoft also isn&rsquo;t adding everything it showed off at Build, including automatic transcription of uploaded files. &ldquo;Please note that not everything shown at Build is part of this early preview,&rdquo; Microsoft says. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 Copilot update" class="wp-image-1974636" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Windows-Copilot-update.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Windows Copilot, within the new Windows 11 test build.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>To access Copilot, you&rsquo;ll need to access the small button on the taskbar to the right of the search box &mdash; and a Microsoft account, too, if you&rsquo;re not already signed in. That will open up Copilot in a right-hand sidebar, which will slide out and back when not in use.</p>



<p>Here are some suggested queries, via Microsoft:</p>



<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Turn on do not disturb.&rdquo;</li>



<li>&ldquo;Change to dark mode.&rdquo;</li>



<li>&ldquo;Take a screenshot&rdquo;</li>



<li>&ldquo;Summarize this website&rdquo; (Active tab in Microsoft Edge)</li>



<li>&ldquo;Write a story about a dog who lives on the moon.&rdquo;</li>



<li>&ldquo;Make me a picture of a serene koi fishpond with lily pads.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 Copilot update Edge" class="wp-image-1974638" height="803" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Windows-Copilot-and-Edge.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Windows Copilot may launch Edge, Microsoft says.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>Microsoft warns that Copilot may generate ads, via Bing. If you hate them, click the small ellipsis menu and let Microsoft know via its feedback tool.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="settings-gets-a-major-update">Settings gets a major update</h2>



<p>Just as intriguing as Copilot are the changes Microsoft is making to the Settings menu. When you open Settings, you&rsquo;ll see a new home page that offers a personalized experience, Microsoft says. </p>



<p>The new experience is organized in cards: up to seven of them, currently. You&rsquo;ll see cards to change your background, summaries of your available OneDrive storage, and more. Here&rsquo;s a list, according to Microsoft:</p>



<ul>
<li>Recommended settings: This card adapts to your specific usage patterns, providing timely and<br />relevant settings options. </li>



<li>Cloud storage: Gives you an overview of your cloud storage use. </li>



<li>Account recovery: Add additional recovery info so you never get locked out of your account.</li>



<li>Personalization: One-click access to update your background theme or change your color mode.</li>



<li>Microsoft 365: Provides a quick glimpse of your subscription status and benefits, along with quick actions.</li>



<li>Xbox: Manage your subscription.</li>



<li>Bluetooth Devices: Bluetooth device management.</li>
</ul>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 Settings menu" class="wp-image-1974637" height="843" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Windows-11-Settings-update.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This is the new card-based Settings menu within Windows 11.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="suggested-snap-layouts-arrive">Suggested Snap Layouts arrive</h2>



<p>Snap has been one of the best additions to Windows since its launch of Windows 10. While you can snap a window to pretty much anywhere you want on a screen, Snap Layouts is the complement that intelligently reorganizes the remaining windows to fit the available space. That&rsquo;s been somewhat of a manual process until now.</p>



<p>With this new build, Microsoft is testing out Windows&rsquo; ability to reorganize the remaining windows in such a way that they&rsquo;ll flow more naturally. This is a test run, so you might not agree. But the suggested Snap Layouts will now show the organization of the windows, <em>and</em> which apps will end up where. Unfortunately, this is a case where not all recipients of the build will see this feature, as Microsoft sometimes does.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-new-volume-mixer">A new volume mixer</h2>



<p>Microsoft is adding an updated Volume Mixer that allows you to control the volume device settings on a per-app basis &mdash; in other words, if you want music from a web app to flow through your headphones, but a Teams conference to play through your desktop speakers, you can do that. Microsoft has also set up a new <strong>Windows + CTRL + V</strong> shortcut to trigger the new mixer.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 volume mixer" class="wp-image-1974635" height="845" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Windows-11-volume-mixer.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Microsoft&rsquo;s updated Volume Mixer within Windows 11.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="restore-apps">Restore apps</h2>



<p>In May, Microsoft said that it would make transitioning to a new PC easier by improving the way apps are ported and restored to a new PC. You&rsquo;ll now see even more apps &ldquo;restored&rdquo; on your Taskbar and desktop, though &ldquo;launching&rdquo; them will kick off the download process from the web or from the Windows Store.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="other-stuff">Other stuff</h2>



<p>Microsoft says that it&rsquo;s increased the number of file types that can be previewed within File Explorer, now including .tar, .rar, and .tgz files, plus more. Narrator also includes support for &ldquo;Great British&rdquo; accents, which we assume is just a generic form of the English accent.</p>



<p>What we don&rsquo;t know, of course, is when Copilot and the rest of these features will end up in stable builds. If Microsoft still holds to its traditional timetable, however, you should expect to see these features in the stable builds of Windows sometime in September and October. </p>

## Nvidia sets 2025 date for RTX 50 series GPUs

<p>&ldquo;When&rsquo;s the next one coming out?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s that nagging little question that haunts PC builders before every major purchase. That&rsquo;s especially true for graphics cards, where the next upgrade might be a tepid update or a literal game-changer. According to a recent presentation, Nvidia may be aiming for a 2025 release window for the next major upgrade to its GPUs, the RTX 50 series. </p>



<p>The info comes from a presentation given to the MLCommons (machine learning) consortium, of which Nvidia is a founding member. The slide spotted by German site <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.hardwareluxx.de/index.php/news/hardware/grafikkarten/61356-n%C3%A4chte-geforce-generation-ada-lovelace-nachfolger-erst-2025.html&amp;xcust=2-3-1974281-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">HardwareLuxx</a> (via <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-to-introduce-ada-lovelace-successor-in-2025&amp;xcust=2-3-1974281-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">VideoCardz</a>) places the &ldquo;Ada Lovelace-Next&rdquo; GPU architecture squarely, if imprecisely, in the first half of 2025. That would put an RTX 5090 release (or whatever the initial flagship is called) at a little less than three years after the Ada Lovelace-based RTX 4090. </p>



<p>That&rsquo;s a bit longer than Nvidia fans are used to, but given the general slowdown in new GPU designs, not entirely surprising. An initial release early in 2025 would also mean we&rsquo;re more likely to see more mainstream cards, presumably an RTX 5070, before the end of the calendar year. And, while this information comes directly from an Nvidia presentation, we should stress that corporate timelines like this are always subject to change. The best-laid plans of mice and international chip megacorps, you know. </p>



<p>Beyond the date, all we can do is speculate, so trying to nail down anything like performance or price for eventual retail products is nigh on pointless. The same slide indicates an early 2024 refresh for the Hopper datacenter GPU and 2025 for the Grace ARM-based CPU architecture (the next-gen version of the Tegra chips that are found in the Nvidia SHIELD set-top box and Nintendo Switch), neither of which is particularly relevant for PC hardware. </p>



<p>For the sake of comparison, rumors place <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/615510/intels-arc-gpu-roadmap-promises-enthusiast-graphics-with-battlemage.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Intel&rsquo;s second-gen &ldquo;Battlemage&rdquo; cards</a> at a mid-2024 release, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/785115/amds-ryzen-7000-and-rdna-3-chips-are-set-to-stun-later-this-year.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">AMD&rsquo;s RDNA 4-based cards</a> (RX 8000 series, presumably) aren&rsquo;t expected before 2025. Of course, new mid-tier and low-end cards in both series might pop up before then. </p>

## Stream Deckâ€™s iOS app now includes free shortcuts

<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407162/elgato-stream-deck-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Elgato&rsquo;s Stream Deck</a> is a cool bit of desktop bling, but if you already have a Wi-Fi-connected screen like a phone or tablet sitting on your desk, why do you need dedicated hardware for PC and streaming shortcuts? You don&rsquo;t: The official <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/elgato-stream-deck-mobile/id1440014184&amp;xcust=2-3-1974403-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Stream Deck Mobile app</a> can replicate basically all of the gadget&rsquo;s capabilities, albeit a little bit more slowly. Previously, the official Stream Deck app for iOS was only available in subscription form, but starting today users can map up to six hotkeys for free. </p>



<p>That basically turns your iPhone or iPad into a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/402358/elgato-stream-deck-mini-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Stream Deck Mini</a>, a $70 array of six buttons with user-customizable screens. The Stream Deck Mobile app connects over your local network to the Stream Deck+ management software on your Windows or Mac machine, behaving more or less exactly like a dedicated Stream Deck device. Capabilities are primarily aimed at video and on-stream production, but basic settings and app shortcuts are popular, and plugins allow for a staggering array of functionality across tons of different games and tools. </p>



<p>The basic six-button setup is available for free on iOS, with a full unlock of up to 64 shortcuts available for a $2.99 subscription. There&rsquo;s also a $25 yearly plan or a $50 &ldquo;lifetime&rdquo; unlock. While the Pro version of the app is <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://play.google.com/store/search?q=stream+deck+mobile&amp;c=apps&amp;xcust=2-3-1974403-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">available on Android as well</a>, the new free tier is not, and there&rsquo;s no indication of when it might be coming. That seems like an oversight for a tool aimed so squarely at power users. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about you, but I loathe traditional vacuuming. When I&rsquo;m not getting feet tangled up in the cord, I&rsquo;m breaking my back lugging it around the house. That&rsquo;s why I always recommend looking into robot vacuums, as they make cleaning your house a heck of a lot easier. If you&rsquo;re looking to pick one up, Best Buy&rsquo;s currently selling the <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fshark-ion-robot-vacuum-wi-fi-connected-light-gray%2F6514531.p%3FskuId%3D6514531&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed" rel="nofollow">Shark ION robot vacuum for $169.99</a>. That&rsquo;s a savings of $80. This vacuum is compatible with all floor types and has a maximum runtime of 120 minutes. That&rsquo;s not too shabby, huh? </p>



<p>The ION features three brush types, easy voice controls, a one year warranty, and more. According to the manufacturer, the &ldquo;Tri-Brush System combines side brushes, channel brushes, and a multi-surface brushroll to handle debris on all surfaces.&rdquo; You can even schedule cleanings with SharkClean, the companion app. The vacuum itself has cliff sensors, which prevent it from crashing down the stairs. My old robot vacuum went tumbling down the stairs once and it was an experience I&rsquo;ll never forget.</p>



<p>This a great deal. Get it now.</p>

<p>It comes down to this: Microsoft is killing off its superior Mail and Calendar apps because it believes <em>its </em>brain is smarter than yours.</p>



<p>One of my few stressful moments during an otherwise peaceful Hawaii vacation was when I learned <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1961053/email-and-calendar-replaced-by-new-outlook-in-windows-11.html">Microsoft is doing away with the Mail and Calendar apps</a>. I&rsquo;ve been an <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/606623/the-best-email-client-for-you-may-be-mail-not-outlook.html">unabashed fan of Mail</a> for years because it does what I want it to do, and nothing else. Mail has a simple, clean, pure interface.</p>



<p>But now Microsoft plans to replace Mail and Calendar with the unified Outlook app interface, beginning next year. Current Mail and Calendar users can test-run the new interface by toggling the &ldquo;try the new Outlook&rdquo; toggle in Outlook&rsquo;s upper-right-hand corner, which flips the interface to the new look. You can then flip back within Outlook by returning the toggle to its previous state. In my tests, the app crashed a couple of times, without losing any data, but then became stable.</p>



<p>So why is Microsoft force-feeding us Outlook? The reasons for Microsoft&rsquo;s decision are pretty much spelled out in Microsoft&rsquo;s <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/outlook-for-windows-the-future-of-mail-calendar-and-people-on-windows-11-715fc27c-e0f4-4652-9174-47faa751b199&amp;xcust=2-2-1970338-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Outlook announcement post</a>. First, by funneling everyone into a single email application for all our accounts (yes, even Gmail, Yahoo Mail, and more), Microsoft will learn more about what we&rsquo;re talking about. This matters because Outlook (and many other components within Windows) will eventually become inputs for <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1924008/windows-copilot-will-bring-ai-into-windows-11.html">Microsoft&rsquo;s Copilot AI engine</a>. The more you feed it information about who you&rsquo;re talking to, what is being discussed, and so on, the better Copilot should theoretically operate.</p>



<p>The second major reason comes down to unification. There&rsquo;s always been a fundamental tension within Windows and Microsoft&rsquo;s apps: Should users work within a single, unified interface, or in separate, purpose-built apps? Mail and Calendar represent the latter approach in its purest form. Outlook believes in the former approach, as your email becomes a jumping-off point for the rest of Microsoft&rsquo;s Office apps. </p>



<p>So there&rsquo;s the background. Are you ambivalent about losing Mail? You shouldn&rsquo;t be, and here&rsquo;s why&hellip;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="outlook-clutter">Outlook clutter</h2>



<p>Oh my, the clutter. Outlook simply has <em>so much</em> going on. A left-hand column of applications. A second column of email folders, with RSS, social feeds, and user-created folders&hellip;all with potential drop-down menus. Various ways of organizing email, such as Focused Inbox and more. Different preview options. It goes on and on and on. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Outlook for Windows app" class="wp-image-1970409" height="801" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Outlook-for-Windows-app.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Outlook just displays so much unnecessary information.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Yes, Mail includes some of that complexity. But in general, it simply reflects how you&rsquo;ve chosen to organize your inbox, and adds little more. Where Outlook begins to feel insulting is what we&rsquo;ll highlight next.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="clutter-on-top-of-clutter">Clutter on top of clutter</h2>



<p>Microsoft Outlook already has a search box. And a help function. Both features show that Microsoft is attempting to cut through the complexity of its user interface. But look out, more is on the way. The new AI-driven <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/videoplayer/embed/RW13l2Y&amp;xcust=2-2-1970338-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Outlook Copilot</a> will appear in a sidebar, and can be used to author emails, suggest appropriate language, or search out relevant documents. Do we really need this? These are all capabilities already built in.</p>



<p>I am absolutely in favor of simplifying and automating the processes I listed above, but do we really need even distracting clutter? The reality is that instead of making the interface &ldquo;simpler&rdquo; to use, swapping Mail for Outlook will simply add complexity.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Mail for Windows app" class="wp-image-1970408" height="709" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Microsoft-Mail-app.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Mail does what you want it to and not much else.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="stability-questions">Stability questions</h2>



<p>As I wrote this, Microsoft was wrestling with an issue that <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/MSFT365Status/status/1673673295076503552&amp;xcust=2-2-1970338-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">took down Microsoft Outlook for the Web</a> for the better part of a day. </p>



<p>Yes, that version of Outlook is a Web app. Outlook for Windows implies that the replacement for Mail and Calendar will be a standalone Windows app. Nonetheless, with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1507212/how-to-run-chatgpt-or-bing-as-a-windows-app.html">the ability to tap-dance between dedicated native code and web apps</a>, I remain unconvinced that killing Mail and Calendar will go smoothly. Give me a dedicated Windows app that depends only on Exchange as a point of failure, and I&rsquo;ll be happy. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="killing-a-critical-feature">Killing a critical feature</h2>



<p>With Mail/Calendar, I can keep my work meetings on the same calendar as my personal dentist and doctor appointments, simply because Calendar accommodates both work and personal accounts. The new Outlook app does not, and you&rsquo;ll receive a message saying so. Instead, the new app only consolidates multiple personal accounts. Apparently you&rsquo;ll need to have both the separate Outlook app for work, as well as the Outlook for Windows app for personal use. This is the whole stupid &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394561/microsoft-wants-you-and-your-crew-to-hang-out-on-teams.html">personal Teams</a>&rdquo; / &ldquo;professional Teams&rdquo; thing, again. </p>



<p>Surely, we can figure out a way to preserve personal and corporate accounts in the same interface, and simply prevent employees from inadvertently copying data from one to the other? I like specific, purpose-built apps, but <em>redundant</em> apps? No thank you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="stifling-competition">Stifling competition</h2>



<p>By having a discrete email client&mdash;Mail&mdash;Microsoft has always held the door open for potentially better email clients to step in. Ditto for Web browsers, calendaring apps, and so on. But now, by killing Mail and enforcing Outlook as your fully integrated Windows email solution, Microsoft is really squeezing the life out of third-party development. It&rsquo;s already been difficult enough for third-party developers apps to step in and improve the increasingly integrated Windows interface. Now, it will be even harder. For example&hellip;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Sunshine contacts" class="wp-image-1970410" height="1025" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sunshone-contacts.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Integrating third-party apps into Microsoft&rsquo;s core productivity apps becomes harder and harder the more tightly integrated they become.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Sunshine.com</p></div>



<p>Yahoo&rsquo;s Marissa Mayer has resurfaced as the driving force behind <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://sunshine.com/&amp;xcust=2-2-1970338-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Sunshine</a>, a new app that promises to streamline your contacts. Anyone who tried out Windows&rsquo; awful <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407224/windows-10s-my-people-microsoft-makes-it-easy-to-just-wave-hello.html">My People app</a> understands that Sunshine offers an opportunity. But where exactly? Not within Windows, as Sunshine is strictly a mobile app for now. So, will Sunshine even take the time to build a Windows app, when Outlook, a driving vehicle for AI, connects so much of the Windows experience together? </p>



<p>Microsoft has said that you&rsquo;ll be able to download Mail and Calendar through 2024, even if your new PC ships with Outlook for Windows. I plan to and will use Copilot&rsquo;s AI features, but I also intend to keep using Mail and Calendar as long as they&rsquo;re available. You should too.</p>
