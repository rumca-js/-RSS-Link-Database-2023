Modern games have made huge strides when it comes to rendering graphics, and AAA games nowadays use ray tracing, photogrammetry, and motion capture to deliver worlds that don’t look all too different from real life. But an area where games still have a long way to go is imitating real-life logic, as even modern releases are guilty of featuring nonsensical game logic that would leave anyone with a weak imagination scratching their heads at the absurdity of it all. 

We’re talking about instances like characters being able to see enemies through walls, or being able to recover from fatal wounds within seconds, and much more. With this feature, we will be looking at 10 such instances of video game logic that make no sense whatsoever.

A new AAA role playing game is always going to have massive expectations to live up to, and while it’s hard to imagine a future where any new instalment in the genre won’t be divisive in the slightest, we can at least get games where the pros far outweigh the cons. 

Final Fantasy 16 is a prime example of that- an excellent action game with an engaging world and captivating story, but also a game with a few flaws, some of which aren’t insignificant. To that end, here, we’re going to talk about some things that we absolutely love about FF16, and a few that we don’t.

On top of this, players have the likes of Disney Illusion Island and The Legend of Heroes: Trails into Reverie to look forward to. So without further ado, check out 15 worthwhile titles launching in July 2023.

There’s been a draught of Pikmin content in recent years, but the bizarre yet lovable real-time strategy franchise is finally making its long-awaited comeback. And while the upcoming Pikmin 4 is obviously going to be the flag-bearer of that comeback, the developer has also released updated versions of Pikmin 1 and 2 for the Switch. 

As far as the actual remastering is concerned, Pikmin 1 and 2 are fairly conservative updates, with improved visuals, updated controls, and some quality-of-life improvements here and there, but thanks to their timeless game design, their intuitive and accessible controls, and their abundance of charm and personality, both games stand the test of time incredibly well. Whether you’re new to the franchise or a veteran looking to walk down memory lane, Pikmin 1 and 2 for the Switch are easy recommendations.
