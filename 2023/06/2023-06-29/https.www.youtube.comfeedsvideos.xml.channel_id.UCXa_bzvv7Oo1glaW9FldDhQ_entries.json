But an area where games still have a long way to go is imitating real-life logic, as even modern releases are guilty of featuring nonsensical game logic that would leave anyone with a weak imagination scratching their heads at the absurdity of it all. \n\nWe\u2019re talking about instances like characters being able to see enemies through walls, or being able to recover from fatal wounds within seconds, and much more. With this feature, we will be looking at 10 such instances of video game logic that make no sense whatsoever.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAJrmjkemKM", "date_published": "2023-06-29 19:30:03+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "6 Things We Love About Final Fantasy 16, and 4 We Don't", "description": "A new AAA role playing game is always going to have massive expectations to live up to, and while it\u2019s hard to imagine a future where any new instalment in the genre won\u2019t be divisive in the slightest, we can at least get games where the pros far outweigh the cons. \n\nFinal Fantasy 16 is a prime example of that- an excellent action game with an engaging world and captivating story, but also a game with a few flaws, some of which aren\u2019t insignificant. To that end, here, we\u2019re going to talk about some things that we absolutely love about FF16, and a few that we don\u2019t.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfTmzJi4PbM", "date_published": "2023-06-29 15:30:23+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "15 BIG Games of July 2023 to Look Forward to [PS5, Xbox Series X | S, PC]", "description": "We're still recovering from June's heavy hitters, and while July may not have the same level of hype, there are still plenty of titles to look forward to.\n\nExoprimal promises some wacky dinosaur hijinx, while Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals looks to elevate the first game's supernatural narrative. Of course, if a light real-time strategy is your thing, then Pikmin 4 is also on the horizon.\n\nOn top of this, players have the likes of Disney Illusion Island and The Legend of Heroes: Trails into Reverie to look forward to.

And while the upcoming Pikmin 4 is obviously going to be the flag-bearer of that comeback, the developer has also released updated versions of Pikmin 1 and 2 for the Switch. \n\nAs far as the actual remastering is concerned, Pikmin 1 and 2 are fairly conservative updates, with improved visuals, updated controls, and some quality-of-life improvements here and there, but thanks to their timeless game design, their intuitive and accessible controls, and their abundance of charm and personality, both games stand the test of time incredibly well. Whether you\u2019re new to the franchise or a veteran looking to walk down memory lane, Pikmin 1 and 2 for the Switch are easy recommendations.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQJm9p3cNyE", "date_published": "2023-06-29 01:00:15+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
