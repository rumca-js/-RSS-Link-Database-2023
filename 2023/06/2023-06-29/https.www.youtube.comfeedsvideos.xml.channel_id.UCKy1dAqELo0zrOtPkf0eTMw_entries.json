That\u2019s now a month ahead of Starfield, which is expected to release on September 1st. PC gamers can expect to play #BaldursGate3 before #Starfield, which SHOULD be enough time to complete the gameplay or at least dive deep enough to feel comfortable with hopping into the driver seat in Starfield when that drops a month later.

But it\u2019s also one of those franchises that is just full of iconic moments which are instantly recognizable, even to people who\u2019ve perhaps never seen the movies that those moments are from.\n\nNow, with Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny hitting theaters for one last Dr. Jones adventure, we spoke to Harrison Ford and the cast of the film about their favorite Indy moments, and why they\u2019re still classic after all these years.\n\nWhen we asked Ford about the most iconic moment from the series, he said he couldn\u2019t pick just one. \u201cGosh, you've just opened a Pandora's box for me because there's so many images,\u201d said the actor. \u201cThere's the rolling ball, there's the swordsman that Indiana Jones ends up shooting.\u201d\nPerhaps not surprisingly, the first sequence from the first movie, Raiders of the Lost Ark, was the source of many of the cast\u2019s picks.\n\n\u201cOh, the boulder for me, Indy running away from the boulder,\u201d Phoebe Waller-Bridge immediately responded when asked the same question. Her Dial of Destiny costar Ethann Isidore agreed with her.\nOf course, you remember that moment as well. Indy has ventured into a Peruvian temple in search of a legendary golden idol. Unfortunately for him, but fortunately for us, he triggers the temple\u2019s ancient booby traps and is forced to exact a thrilling and death-defying escape. It all culminates in a giant boulder heading right down main, with Dr. Jones the only pin in this deadly bowling ball\u2019s way.\nFor the full story on Harrison Ford\u2019s favorite Indy moments, watch the video.\n\n#IGN #Movies #IndianaJones", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGRDAXWX_zQ", "date_published": "2023-06-29 15:03:33+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon - Official Gameplay Trailer", "description": "Here's a look at some brand new Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon gameplay.
