<p><strong>Home, Manchester</strong><br />At times chaotic but never less than virtuosic, Philip Venables’ take on Larry Mitchell’s 70s manifesto is gritty but sensual and extravagant</p><p>It begins with a woman humming. She stands defiantly at the edge of the stage, arms crossed, looking out into the packed auditorium (still ringing with chatter, house lights up) and sings wordlessly – a low, circling tune just loud enough to be picked up by her body mic. By the time she opens her mouth to add words – “It’s been a long time and we are still not free” – to the same melodic riff, the silence in Home’s Theatre 1 is absolute.</p><p>It is the first of several moments of stripped-back beauty in a show that somehow manages to be both grittily DIY and sensuously extravagant. The stage is a black box, with wooden chairs and musical instruments strewn around its edges, like a village hall before a rehearsal. A single small bell hangs down on one side. It is rung periodically to mark what might, in a different sort of piece, be called scene changes. Placards are also occasionally used as low-tech intertitles, displaying important names and places – though who could possibly forget “Warren-and-his-Fuckpole”, despotic ruler of “Ramrod”?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/29/the-faggots-and-their-friends-between-revolutions-review-manchester">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This moving documentary uses smartphone footage to show the astonishing bravery of young protesters who gave their lives fighting a brutal regime. It’s unspeakably powerful</p><p>Inside the Iranian Uprising hides a question in its title. How can it be possible to get inside a totalitarian regime, amid a brutal crackdown on protesters, activists and journalists, to tell the story of what has happened over the past nine months in Iran?</p><p>It opens with a powerful montage of the sorts of clips that are posted to social media all the time, around the world, of teenagers on a beach, at a wedding, blowing bubbles in the kitchen, swimming, singing, dancing. All of these young people are dead. As the BBC has been banned from working inside Iran, it has instead gathered footage shot mostly by young Iranians on their smartphones and worked with activists and exiles to verify more than 100 hours of clips. In this way, it attempts to piece together what happened after the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody, which led to mass protests across the country.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/29/inside-the-iranian-uprising-review-an-unforgettable-memorial-to-teens-who-died-for-freedom">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Nicky Campbell’s look at the 70s Scottish pop stars details the systematic sexual exploitation of the band by their manager. It’s a sensitively told tale of horrific cruelty</p><p>If professions were ranked by how nefarious their members were, “boyband manager” would be in the same league as “despot”. Ever since young men learned to harmonise while making teenage girls swoon, there has been a succession of people, from the Jackson 5’s abusive patriarch to ‘NSync’s embezzling Lou Perlman, ready to take advantage of boys with a sweet voice and a big dream.</p><p>ITV’s Secrets of the Bay City Rollers title hints at something similarly unscrupulous: that beneath the tartan and the handsome grins, there were some financial and ethical shenanigans. But this programme proves to be far more troubling than that – it is one of the most disturbing accounts of abuse imaginable. Presenter Nicky Campbell uncovers a near inconceivably sadistic and far-reaching network of cruelty that the young men comprising Scottish pop rock band Bay City Rollers were forced to endure – as their manager Tam Paton controlled every aspect of their lives, sexually and emotionally abused them and facilitated their abuse by others. Those triggered by sexual violence and child abuse should give this programme the widest possible berth as it unflinchingly lays bare not just the abuse of the band, but also the widespread sexual abuse of children in Scotland in the 1970s.</p><p>Secrets of the Bay City Rollers was on ITV1 and is available on ITVX.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/29/secrets-of-the-bay-city-rollers-review-one-of-the-most-disturbing-accounts-of-abuse-imaginable">Continue reading...</a>

A Black, queer, New York theatre usher (Kyle Ramar Freeman) is writing a play about a Black queer man who, in turn, is writing a play about a Black queer man. So it draws its circles within circles, looping impressively without any contrivance, although there is great intellectual and emotional complication within the loops.</p><p>Usher is a sweet, vulnerable twentysomething whose opening number, Intermission Song, sings of travelling through the world “in a fat, Black, queer body.” As familiar as its exploration of identity politics may sound, it is given highly original, often entertaining, treatment with no hint of clunky polemic.</p><p><a href="https://strangeloopmusical.com/">At the Barbican theatre, London,</a> until 9 September.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/29/a-strange-loop-review-fat-black-queer-body-musical-is-magnificent">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Marquis Theatre, New York</strong></p><p>There’s some fun to be had in a splashy attempt to squeeze the pop star’s music into a meta fairytale crowd-pleaser even with potholes along the way</p><p>There are two types of people in the world: those that appreciate the musical catalog of one Britney Spears, and those who observe her stardom from afar. For those in the former category, myself included, the new musical Once Upon a One More Time, now playing at Broadway’s Marquis Theatre, promises at least a baseline level of fun: a jukebox show of Spears’s most popular songs (along with some deeper cuts), albeit one flimsily woven around a familiar and overdone pop-feminist revision of classic fairy tales.</p><p>The often winsome and freshly choreographed show, from a book by Jon Hartmere, pulls not from Britney’s story – this is not a sanitized version of her electric career and often tragic life, a la <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/feb/04/mj-the-musical-review-broadway">Broadway’s MJ</a> – but from obviously heartfelt appreciation and larger cultural reconsideration of her legacy. America’s former pop sweetheart takes the form of Cinderella (Briga Heelan), consigned to play the role of damsel in distress for an unwitting Prince Charming (Justin Guarini) over and over again in a meta-fairy tale factory.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/29/once-upon-a-one-more-time-review-britney-spears-musical">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The undervaluing of social care is a betrayal of the hardworking healthcare professionals who got us through the pandemic, writes <strong>Rachael Dodgson</strong>, while <strong>Kalvin Morris</strong> calls for better-run care recruitment</p><p>Your editorial on care workers being undervalued and underpaid hits the nail on the head (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/25/the-guardian-view-on-care-workers-undervalued-and-underpaid" title="">25 June</a>). There needs to be a long-term workforce plan for adult social care as well as the NHS to enhance the quality of care and support provided by both. We know that social care workers already seek jobs in the NHS – where pay and conditions are better – and an NHS-only plan is likely to exacerbate this. Demand for care workers is already at an all-time high.</p><p>The ongoing deprioritisation of social care is a betrayal of the hardworking, skilled individuals who were on the frontline of the pandemic and continue to provide essential care and support for older and disabled people. Our research reveals that 80% of the public believe social care is as important and deserves the same respect as the NHS. Yet the government has cut £250m from promised funding to support its workforce.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/29/social-care-needs-a-long-term-workforce-plan">Continue reading...</a>

Since a brief spell as player-manager of Indian Super League team ATK in 2018, Keane has dabbled in coaching without ever taking on a full-time management role. He helped out Mick McCarthy during his most recent stint as Ireland manager, worked alongside Jonathan Woodgate at Middlesbrough and was last spotted filling the Sammy Lee-shaped void in Big Sam’s backroom team after a judge refused to release the former England midfielder from jury service in time for a doomed attempt to keep Leeds in the Premier League.</p><p>Your recall of British players in Germany (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/28/harry-kane-can-be-bundesligas-new-british-hero-but-spurs-stand-in-way">yesterday’s Football Daily</a>) failed to mention Paul Lambert and his time at Borussia Dortmund. Lambert was the first Brit to gain a winners’ medal in the newly formed Big Cup and was pivotal in Dortmund’s run, defeating Manchester United in the semi-final and Juventus in the final.

<p>I revelled in my hard-earned smugness. But as an extremist in all things consumption, could I find a path back to moderation?</p><p></p><p>I love to quit things. It’s a point of pride. I am happy to leave the party early. I don’t particularly enjoy doing anything, so the chance to stop is always a thrill. Like most men who can no longer escape a chair without making a loud and embarrassing noise, I get a lot of my personal philosophy from Michael Mann’s Heat (1995): “Don’t let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner.”</p><p>This is, of course, all bluster from me. My wife, child and annoying cavoodle would all have follow-up questions if I actually tried to live this philosophy. It was a wise choice to never give De Niro’s character a cavoodle. It’s also worth acknowledging that even if I tried to live that way, the vast majority of my 30 seconds would be spent trying to get out of the aforementioned chair. But in my heart, the principle remains true.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/29/i-quit-drinking-with-flying-colours-oh-the-things-i-could-see-from-my-high-horse">Continue reading...</a>

In a statement, the YHA said the decision had been taken after a difficult few years for the charity. “Pandemic shutdowns, the cost of living crisis and steep inflation have affected us like other charities and hospitality providers,” it said.</p><p>The sell-off is the first step in a three-year business plan announced on 23 June “to secure YHA’s long-term prosperity”. The Covid pandemic hit the charity hard: the YHA lost more than 80% of its income in 2020/21. Now 90% of its income comes from just 60% of its hostels. The restructure will focus on raising occupancy at the more popular properties, aiming to increase customers by 30% while reducing staff by 20%.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/jun/29/cost-of-living-crisis-prompts-yha-to-sell-off-20-of-its-150-hostels">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An all-star cast arrived in Westminster on Monday with a potted Julius Caesar, partly in hopes of elevating public discourse. It’s good to have a dream …</p><p>A murder took place in the speaker’s rooms at the House of Commons on Monday night. Greg Doran, former director of the Royal Shakespeare Company, was stabbed in the front – unusual in theatrical circles where people are more often stabbed in the back – by his successor, Daniel Evans. Rather than being reported to the police, the action was widely applauded since it was part of a potted, all-star performance of Julius Caesar staged to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the publication of Shakespeare’s First Folio.</p><p>The setting was appropriate in a number of ways. The current speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, reminded us that one of his predecessors, Thomas Hanmer, was a Shakespeare scholar who published his own edition of the plays in 1744. James Morris, MP and chair of the <a href="https://www.parallelparliament.co.uk/APPG/shakespeare">All Party Parliamentary Group for Shakespeare</a>, stressed Shakespeare’s eternal political relevance. “He deals,” said Morris, “with the danger of tyranny, the narcissism of politicians, the thin dividing line between fantasy and reality.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/29/julius-caesar-house-of-commons-shakespeare-400-years-first-folio">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Stefanovich/WDR SO/Chiacchiarini/Rundel<br />(Winter &amp; Winter)<br /></strong>Tamara Stefanovich’s piano threads delicately through glittering orchestral textures in the concerto for left hand only, paired here with the jewel-like miniatures of Ten Sinfonias</p><p>The best known of the 20th-century piano concertos composed for the left hand only – works by Ravel, Prokofiev, Britten, Martinů and Janáček, among others – were commissioned by pianists who had lost the use of their right hand. But, as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/hans-abrahamsen">Hans Abrahamsen</a> puts it, his Left, Alone, first performed in 2016, was not written for a pianist with only one hand, but by “a composer who can only play with one hand”. Abrahamsen was born with restricted use of his right hand, and, though he played the piano from childhood, that limitation gave him “an alternative focus on the whole piano literature”.</p><p>His long-held idea of writing a left-hand concerto came to fruition in Left, Alone. Formally, it’s made up of a typical Abrahamsen sequence of short movements, six in all, which fall into two groups of three. The solo writing is largely melodic – there are few of the massive chords that Ravel conjures up in his Piano Concerto for the Left Hand, for instance – as the piano threads its lonely way through the typically glittering orchestral textures, almost oblivious to what surrounds it.

<p><strong>Linbury theatre, Royal Opera House, London</strong><br />A female prisoner’s experiences of patriarchal brutality are intensified by Bushra El-Turk’s music, skilfully combining Arabic and western instrumentation</p><p><a href="https://www.bushraelturk.com/">Bushra El-Turk</a>’s multimedia opera Woman at Point Zero is an angry yet restrained distillation of the 1975 novel of the same name by the Egyptian feminist and activist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/06/woman-at-point-zero-by-nawal-el-saadawi-review">Nawal El Saadawi</a>. Extracts from the opera, then a work in progress, were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jul/16/woman-at-point-zero-review-nawal-el-saadawi-lso-st-lukes">performed during the 2017 Shubbak festival</a>, though it was only heard complete in Aix-en-Provence last year, and now it comes to London after performances in Belgium and Luxembourg. (<a href="https://www.lod.be/en/">LOD music theatre</a>, based in Ghent, are the co-producers.) The creative team, meanwhile, are all women, and this Linbury run forms the centrepiece of this year’s <a href="https://www.roh.org.uk/tickets-and-events/festival/engender-dates">Engender festival</a>, focusing on new work by female and non-binary artists.</p><p>At the opera’s centre is an encounter between Fatma (<a href="https://www.dimaorsho.com/">Dima Orsho</a>), a sex worker and activist jailed for killing an abusive pimp, and Sama (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIl4y38AqVU">Carla Nahadi Babelegoto</a>), a documentary film-maker interrogating the initially reluctant Fatma about her life. The tale the latter eventually tells, in which Sama sees a reflection of her own concerns, catalogues the brutalities of a patriarchal society that have fed both her desire for emancipation and the sense of individual freedom and integrity she now feels despite the confines of a prison. This all-important backstory is told with extraordinary rapidity in places, barely giving us, or indeed the characters, time for its implications to fully sink in. Hurtling momentum may have been the intention, but this feels rushed at times, and the opera’s dramatic power might have proved greater had El-Turk and librettist Stacy Hardy actually been more expansive in their treatment.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/29/woman-at-point-zero-review-linbury-theatre-royal-opera-house-london">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Partisan)</strong><br />Enigmatic and occasionally disturbing, the songwriter adapts her own book of poetry into a rough-edged LP full of potency and atmosphere</p><p>The last time the world of music heard from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/pjharvey">Polly Harvey</a> was more than seven years ago, in the spring of 2016. Brexit had yet to happen, Barack Obama was still president, and the 53-year-old was on a world tour, albeit the kind of tour the late PJ O’Rourke conducted to research his 1988 opus Holidays in Hell, rather than the kind that involves roadies, riders and soundchecks. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/14/pj-harvey-the-hope-six-demolition-project-review-potent-beautiful-songs-and-minor-lyrical-missteps">The Hope Six Demolition Project</a>, Harvey’s ninth studio album, offered a travelogue of ravaged locations around the globe – Afghanistan, Kosovo, the roughest neighbourhoods of Washington DC – that Harvey had visited in the company of photographer and film-maker Seamus Murphy. It was clearly a process that she ultimately found exhausting: by the end of the accompanying run of live shows, she was apparently considering retiring from music entirely.</p><p>She didn’t, but after seven years of dabbling in film and television scores and doing whatever it is that Polly Harvey does when she’s not being PJ Harvey (which frankly could be anything from practising diabolism to getting the prosecco in and inviting the girls over for Love Island – few contemporary artists have so successfully drawn a complete veil over their personal lives), she has returned in a very different place. The one similarity between I Inside the Old Year Dying and its predecessor is that it arrives preceded by a book of poetry, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/29/orlam-by-pj-harvey-review-a-musicians-vision-of-a-curious-childhood">Orlam</a>, an alternately disturbing, dream-like and mysterious novel in verse: I Inside the Old Year Dying essentially adapts 12 of its poems for lyrics. They are set very close to home, in Dorset – where Harvey was born and still lives – and written in thick, occasionally archaic local dialect. Orlam came with a glossary, which is useful when listening to the album, although you don’t need it to understand why Harvey might be enthralled by the language she uses, above and beyond simply geographically rooting the songs. Chawly-wist, clodgy, giltcup, reddick, un-gurrel, puxy: these are words that sound great – rich and satisfying in the mouth – even if you don’t know what they mean.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/29/pj-harvey-i-inside-the-old-year-dying-review-a-disquieting-escape-into-the-wilds-of-dorset">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Russian leader’s show of mercy towards Yevgeny Prigozhin was not a sign of weakness but a shrewd move</p><p>Much of the western analysis of the events in Russia last weekend has concluded that Vladimir Putin displayed his weakness by allowing Yevgeny Prigozhin and other Wagner group commanders to depart peacefully <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/27/belarus-exiled-wagner-chief-yevgeny-prigozhin-russia-ukraine">for Belarus</a>, and the rank-and-file to join the Russian army or retire to their homes. Of course, if Putin had in fact crushed the revolt by force and executed its leaders, commentators would have used this as more evidence of his brutality and ruthlessness, and perhaps also of the innate savagery and violence of the Russian national tradition.</p><p>These conclusions are coloured by an understandable dislike of the Russian leader, and they do not constitute sober and objective analysis. In fact, though Putin was obviously responsible for creating the background to this mess, we should consider the possibility that at the weekend he handled things well. In his <a href="http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/71496">address to the nation</a> on Saturday morning, he displayed determination and resolve. Putin made clear that he had no intention of surrendering to Prigozhin’s demands, and that if he and the other Wagner leaders continued their revolt, they would be charged with treason (and, by implication, probably executed).</p><p>Anatol Lieven is director of the Eurasia programme at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft and author of books including Ukraine and Russia: A Fraternal Rivalry</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/29/failed-wagner-coup-vladimir-putin-regime-strong-yevgeny-prighozin">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When musician Samuel Smith received a life-changing diagnosis he decided to make the record he’d always dreamed of – and many of his Nashville heroes agreed to play on it</p><p>It was 3 December 2020 when I found out. For months I had been battling stiffness in my right arm. Now, the test results had come back from the lab. “You do know what’s going on here, don’t you?” my neurologist inquired, peering over the top of his notes. I could feel all the air being sucked out of the room. Suddenly I was hovering between a life lived and a new life to be faced. “You’ve got Parkinson’s.”</p><p>Fast forward to my living room a few weeks later. I was perched over my guitar and in a tailspin. Playing should have been as easy as breathing; instead, I was paralysed – unable to play a note. The voice in my head screamed “play, play” but my hand wouldn’t move.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/29/i-wanted-to-play-but-my-hand-wouldnt-move-making-an-album-with-parkinsons">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Tolerably corny taboo-busting tale of a lovable loser who courts a beautiful woman features epic dance scenes and catchy, involving music</p><p>There are strains of Richard Curtis and even Shakespeare in this charmingly cheesy Bollywood film about a thirtysomething manchild who falls for a woman way out of his league. Set in Gujarat and directed by Sameer Vidwans, Kartik Aaryan plays Sattu, an unemployed loafer who spends his time moaning about his enduring virginity and doing the housework (badly) for his despairing parents. When he goes to a dance and sees the resplendent Katha (Kiara Advani) performing, he resolves to win her heart – only to discover that she has a flash boyfriend. Sattu’s chances with her soon rise, however, when he gallantly saves her life and is promised her hand in marriage by her sinister father, for reasons that are slowly teased out.</p><p>This is a film bursting with colour and movement, with talky, dramatic sections ceding to epic dance sequences involving hundreds of impeccably turned-out performers. There’s been grumbling in some quarters about one of the songs, which is a reworking of the Pakistani megahit Pasoori; here, the original’s melancholy beauty is ditched for a blander, more upbeat sound. But the rest of the music, on the whole, is catchy and involving.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/29/satyaprem-ki-katha-review-bollywood-romcom-hindi">Continue reading...</a>

But if anything what waves over me instead is nearer embarrassment.</p><p>Because it’s not cool. While I’m no narcissist I still entertain the hope that others may view me as urbane, as metropolitan. Go to the football a bit and you’re not totally kissing that perception goodbye. No Venn diagram in the world overlaps GQ cover stars and people who’ve been to half the grounds in the Ardal North West. I could have spent all those Saturdays mastering a musical instrument, learning a new language, maybe two. I could’ve travelled; to new countries rather than new leagues. Imagine how interesting I could’ve been. How many of the world’s great raconteurs have anecdotes that hinge on a knowledge of the Southern Counties East Football League Division One?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/29/visited-300-football-stadiums-grounds-groundhopper-proud-embarrassed">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The tale of three British expat women in Tuscany takes an unsparing look at the indignities and injustices of old age</p><p>In the fictional Tuscan hilltop village of Santorno, the setting for Amanda Craig’s entertaining and surprisingly bracing new novel, the Three Graces of her title are preparing for a spring wedding. Adorning this idyll – or “Hampstead-by-Tuscany”, as it is christened by a disgruntled member of the younger generation – Craig’s Graces are a trio of elderly expatriates with a total of “four breasts, five eyes and three hip replacements” between them.</p><p>Still just about standing after two years of lockdowns, self-satisfied Ruth Viner is a retired psychiatrist, American by birth. Then there is elegant Marta Koning, a concert pianist and twice an émigré, born in Berlin to communist parents before marrying into the English aristocracy and then in widowhood opting for <em>la dolce vita</em>. Ruth’s erstwhile neighbour in London, Marta is the wealthiest of the Graces, living happily off the considerable proceeds of the sale of her Hampstead home. Marta’s sister-in-law Diana completes the set: a veteran of 1960s Zimbabwe (which she still thinks of as Rhodesia), mourning her childhood country pile in England and “living on the cusp between poverty and parsimony”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/29/the-three-graces-by-amanda-craig-review-a-fearless-comedy-of-errors">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>PC, Nintendo Switch (version tested), PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S/X; Marvelous<br /></strong>Become slowly enmeshed in a rural community in this game about the farm and family</p><p>Even among the eccentric stable of farming games, this is a bit of an odd duck. A Wonderful Life was originally a Harvest Moon game on the Gamecube, and though it retains the trappings of most farm games (crops, livestock, fishing, spelunking), there isn’t as much moment-to-moment pressure to maximise your yields. Where games such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/dec/16/stardew-valley-eric-barone-interview-soundtrack-seasons-high-scores">Stardew Valley</a> or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/feb/27/rune-factory-4-special-review-nintendo-switch">Rune Factory</a> lock you into an absorbing cycle of equipment upgrades and farm expansion, A Wonderful Life is content to let you potter around town at a leisurely pace. Each season lasts just 10 days. Farming seems almost an afterthought.</p><p>That’s because the game’s focus is – as the title suggests – on having a wonderful life; there’s far more to do after you’ve built up your farm, chosen a partner and settled down. Characters age and change over time; new faces move in and others depart. You can’t even progress past the first year until you get married, though thankfully the bar for marriage here is set unrealistically low. If you don’t propose to a prospective partner after your first year, they’ll turn up on your doorstep and make it happen.</p><p>Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life is out now; £34.99</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jun/29/story-of-seasons-a-wonderful-life-game-review">Continue reading...</a>

This is the last time Henry Cavill will play wandering swordsman Geralt of Rivia: from season four onwards, the lead role is to be taken over by Chris Hemsworth’s less successful brother Liam, from the Hunger Games movies and, before that, Neighbours. This week, a Witcher producer boldly compared the move to the recasting of James Bond or the Doctor: “We’re trusting that … the IP itself is what is drawing a lot of fans.”</p><p>The Witcher season three is on Netflix now.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/29/the-witcher-season-three-review-henry-cavills-pulse-quickening-last-stand-as-an-anti-heroic-hunk">Continue reading...</a>

## There are two kinds of antiracism. Only one works, and it has nothing to do with 'diversity training' | Arun Kundani

<p>While liberal antiracists argue over vocabulary, radicals take direct action – which is the only way to change the system</p><p>In news that ought to please antiracist campaigners everywhere, just recently everybody seems to be talking about antiracism.

But all the time, both sides in the debate mistakenly assume there is only one kind of antiracism.

<p>The Austrian artist’s socially conscious creations twist the everyday into the hilariously abstract. His new exhibition comprises works that question the nature of reality itself</p><p>Exhibitions by the Austrian artist Erwin Wurm not only have a distinctive look, they often also have a distinctive sound: embarrassed laughter. Visitors can be seen marvelling at, standing on, or leaning against a variety of objects as incongruously varied as a 1960s caravan, a hot-water bottle with legs, or giant-sized sausages and gherkins.</p><p>“Humour is a side-effect of the method I use, of looking at our world from the perspective of the absurd, and sometimes the paradoxical,” says Wurm. “But I’m not interested in making jokes.

<p>A science writer charts the monumental impact of having children from every angle </p><p>Motherhood changes a person. We all know this. Yet in so-called Weird countries (western, educated, industrialised, rich and democratic) there is very little in the way of ritual to acknowledge this rite of passage, this fundamental transformation. How can this be, Lucy Jones asks, when it is “a transition that involves a whole spectrum of emotional and existential ruptures”?</p><p>Unlike adolescence, “matrescence” is scarcely marked. Instead, we are expected to get on with it, sublimate all our needs to our new baby, and weather this most fundamental of human shifts without making too much of a fuss. We don’t properly recognise “the psychological and physiological significance of becoming a mother: how it affects the brain, the endocrine system, cognition, immunity, the psyche, the microbiome, the sense of self”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/29/matrescence-by-lucy-jones-review-the-birth-of-a-mother">Continue reading...</a>

<p>DA Pennebaker’s documentary offers moving moments and raw immediacy as the musician takes on his final performance as Ziggy Stardust</p><p>DA Pennebaker’s record of David Bowie’s final concert on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziggy_Stardust_Tour">Ziggy Stardust tour</a> at London’s Hammersmith Odeon in 1973 (Bowie is part of the reason we will never be reconciled to saying “Eventim Apollo”) is rereleased after a restoration. It was the legendary “all killer no filler” gig at which, in the presence of the Spiders from Mars – Mick Ronson (guitar), Trevor Bolder (bass), Mick Woodmansey (drums) – he retired his Ziggy Stardust persona, announcing to a stunned crowd that it was the last time he would ever play (as Ziggy).</p><p>The show itself, in which Bowie and band members appear starkly key-lit in darkness, with the crowd glimpsed briefly and almost stroboscopically, looks intriguingly intimate, like something at a much smaller club venue. The concert is straightforward and almost minimalist in its staging and Bowie’s cheeky theatrical genius and rackety exotica has something panto about it. Often, the piano and sax lines in Changes give the event a Vegas-residency feel, although no Vegas residency, even in 1973, would be so austerely presented. (Aladdin Sane is incidentally, along with “the Beatles”, a phrase which has transcended its own wordplay origins.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/29/ziggy-stardust-and-the-spiders-from-mars-review-bowie-bids-farewell-to-an-icon-in-legendary-gig">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After years of austerity, local pantries are starting to question whether food handouts get people out of poverty</p><p>Just over a year ago, with the cost of living crisis in full swing and levels of hardship and hunger rocketing in her deprived patch of east London, Denise Bentley shut down the food bank she founded more than a decade ago. “It was a difficult step to take,” she says, “but we realised the food bank was not the answer to the problem.”</p><p>At the time, demand for its food parcels was off the scale; food supplies were harder and harder to source; and staff and volunteers were burnt out. Bentley recalls: “The question was: do we spend £100,000 on buying food and stocking the warehouse? Or do we spend the money on transforming people’s lives?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/29/food-banks-are-not-the-answer-charities-search-for-new-way-to-help-uk-families">Continue reading...</a>

Their use in security is legal and common in Kenya because of the risk of violent theft, including from young men who regularly go in organised groups to steal pineapples, but the claims suggest the guards’ use of violence has been excessive.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/jun/29/guards-at-del-monte-pineapple-farm-in-kenya-accused-of-killings-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
