Nowadays Linux is the king of the FOSS world with BSD sitting off to the side doing it's thing, but there was another kernel that could have taken it's place, GNU/Hurd. The only problem is it arrived a little bit too late, since then it's only continued to fall further and further but it's still being developed.
