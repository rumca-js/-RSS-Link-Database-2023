This was considered a vital puzzle piece to a group called Not Finding A Cow Level Discord. As the name suggests, it's a Discord server dedicated to discovering whether the cow level is real.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Since removing this quest, a good chunk of Discord has started to look at older Diablo games and even World of Warcraft to see if there are any clues within the game's lore. But as of now, no one has found anything that could provide answers.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-latest-patch-has-made-it-even-harder-to-find-the-secret-cow-level/1100-6515594/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-latest-patch-has-made-it-even-harder-to-find-the-secret-cow-level/1100-6515594/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-06-29 22:43:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "The Biggest Game Releases Of July 2023", "description": "<p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4158223-julygames2023.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">After six months of non-stop hits, July feels like a much-needed breather on the gaming calendar. While there are still some games to look forward to next month, there's a more relaxed atmosphere with what's on offer. More good vibes than end-of-the-world panic for <em>most </em>of the games on this list. There's a cozy feeling of calm, highly anticipated PC ports, and adorable strategy to look forward to.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">RPG fans get both The Legend of Heroes: Trails into Reverie and Atelier Marie Remake: The Alchemist of Salburg, two dives into wildly different universes anchored by a lovable cast of wizards and alchemists. Prefer something more laid-back instead? Then check out Oxenfree II, which combines witty banter with a Twin Peaks-style mystery to create a fascinating dive into conspiracy theories and cults.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">On the AAA side of the calendar, Capcom is bringing a dino crisis to console and PC, albeit in the form of Exoprimal. Imagine a fusion between Anthem and Overwatch set in Jurassic Park, and you've got a good idea of what to expect here. Nintendo has a busy year ahead, and with the first brand-new Pikmin game in a decade, the studio is building up some big momentum with its return to quirky real-time strategy and adorable puzzle-solving.</p><p>You can see the rest of the highlights below and everything else coming out later this month. Don't expect to see Immortals of Aveum this month, as<a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-delays-its-big-new-magical-first-person-spell-shooter/1100-6515332/\"> EA's first-person magic-shooter has been delayed to August 22</a>, a date that sandwiches it between <em>possible </em>GOTY contender Smurfs Kart and Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon.To see what else is arriving this year, you can check out our feature on <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2023-upcoming-games-release-schedule/1100-6508202/\">all the games coming out in 2023</a>.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Legend of Heroes: Trails into Reverie - July 7</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4158214-legendofheroes.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>It has been a great year for RPGs, and for another game in that genre that'll gobble up hours of your time, look no further than The Legend of Heroes: Trails into Reverie. This new entry in the series follows three protagonists--Cold Steel IV's Rean Scwharzer, Trails to Azure's Lloyd Bannings, and new character C--across individual storylines and draws the curtain on the Crossbell and Cold Steel Arcs of previous games. The refined combat includes the new United Front system that allows you to boost your abilities by using the power of your teammates, and you'll be able to draw on other skills from the Crossroads System in your journey.</p><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Legend-Heroes-Trails-into-Reverie-PlayStation/dp/B09BDW5SMT?tag=gamespot-preorders-20\">See on Amazon</a> </div></div><p> </p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Oxenfree II: Lost Signals - July 12</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4158217-oxenfree2.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Oxenfree II doesn't look like it'll be drastically deviating from the formula of its predecessor, but it does look like it'll be tightening up on that beloved coming-of-age saga with more polished narrative-adventure gameplay. Like the first game, expect a distinct art style, dynamic conversations, and environmental puzzles in this spooky tale that features new characters, cults, and plenty of banter. If you have a Netflix account, keep an eye on your mobile storefront as Oxenfree II will be added to the Netflix gaming library on day one.</p><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1574310/OXENFREE_II_Lost_Signals/\">See on Steam</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Atelier Marie Remake: The Alchemist of Salburg - July 13</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4158213-ateliermarie.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Not every RPG needs to be focused on saving the world from a cataclysmic cosmic threat!

In Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life, it's what leads your farmer to return to Forgotten Valley in hopes of creating a life similar to the idyllic one led by their parents. It's also what led me--clad in my finest, rose-tinted glasses--to revisit A Wonderful Life with its recent remake. As I downloaded this new version of a game I once sunk several hours into for my Nintendo Switch, I reminisced about the first time I played the game two decades ago--the feel of my grandparents' itchy carpet, the satisfying \"click\" of my purple GameCube closing before it kicked into a soft whir... It was never my favorite Harvest Moon game--that spot was reserved for Back to Nature--but it was one that I found unique and enjoyable.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In some ways, I also feel that way about its 2023 remake. Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life is a very different type of farming simulator in that it's one that focuses more on relationships, family, and legacy than farm work. It's a concept I can get behind, and A Wonderful Life's emphasis on streamlining gameplay and eliminating tedium is a breath of fresh air. However, despite social-sim dynamics being at the forefront of A Wonderful Life, player interactions and the community itself feel shallow. Although the character creation process might be more involved than ever, few NPCs are memorable, dialogue is scarce, and the game's idyllic setting turns eerie quickly due to the town's vacant atmosphere. Yet if I factor out this less-than-wonderful content, not all that much is left, making A Wonderful Life feel dated and empty--especially when compared to other games in the now-highly saturated farming game genre.</p><figure style=\"width: 1280px;\"><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4159408-1%281%29.jpg\"><img alt=\"The farmer and Takakura find two dogs.\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4159408-1%281%29.jpg\" /></a><figcaption>The farmer and Takakura find two dogs.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\">Like most farming sims, A Wonderful Life begins with a letter--only this time it's sent <em>from </em>your character rather than to you. After growing tired of life in the city, your character pens a letter to your parents' former friend, Takakura, informing him of your intention to come to Forgotten Valley and take over your parents' old farm. Upon your arrival, Takakura offers your farmer a cow, a decent sum of money, and a tutorial that beautifully walks the fine line between overbearing and uninformative, before giving you total control over your character and farm.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/story-of-seasons-a-wonderful-life-review-putting-the-past-in-pastoral/1900-6418084/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/story-of-seasons-a-wonderful-life-review-putting-the-past-in-pastoral/1900-6418084/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-06-29 20:30:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "The Fortnite Battle Bus Is Now A Transformer", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Transformers, the legion of alien robots blending in as earthly vehicles, is adding a new member to its fleet: the Fortnite Battle Bus.

This time-honored tradition of clearing out Steam wishlists without breaking the bank (unless you buy a lot of games, of course) is one of the most sacred events of the year for PC gamers. The Steam Summer Sale runs for a full two weeks, ending on <strong>July 13 at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET</strong>. We've rounded up some of the best deals in the Steam Summer Sale below.</p><p>As usual, there's a nice mix of fairly recent releases for prices we rarely (or never) see and older games for bargain prices. We mostly stuck with games that launched over the past couple years with our list. You can grab big-name games like Elden Ring, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, Final Fantasy VII Remake: Intergrade, and Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered for great prices.</p><p>Regardless of whether you're looking for AAA hits or indie darlings, the Steam Summer Sale is certainly worth browsing. As usual, you're more likely to find a game that <em>is </em>on sale rather than <em>isn't</em>. All major publishers and a massive number of indie studios take part in Steam's annual sales bonanza.</p><p>If you're a Steam Deck owner, the Summer Sale will likely be of even more interest to you. A huge number of verified and playable Steam Deck games are up for grabs in the sale. If you're specifically looking for games to play on your fancy handheld, you should check out our roundup of the <a
