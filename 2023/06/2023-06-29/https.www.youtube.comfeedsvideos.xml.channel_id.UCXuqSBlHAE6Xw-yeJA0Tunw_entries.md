Making a Gaming news channel is easy. The hard part is finding some space to shoot it. Despite buying a separate building for our Lab, we have precious little space for more sets. WE got Short Circuit, Mac Address, Techlinked, Tech Quickie and Linus Tech Tips competing for space, it is getting cramped in here. But with the magic of green screen, we can transport ourselves anywhere. But with the BlackMagic Ultimatte 12, we can also do it live instead of in post.
