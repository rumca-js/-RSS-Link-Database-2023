## Baldur's Gate 3 PC Release Moved To Avoid Starfield - IGN Daily Fix

To avoid running into Bethesda’s massive space epic Starfield, the devs over at Larian made the smart move of pushing the release date for Baldur’s Gate 3 up a month. Originally planned to release on August 31st, fans of the franchise can now expect to play the PC version on August 3rd. That’s now a month ahead of Starfield, which is expected to release on September 1st. PC gamers can expect to play #BaldursGate3 before #Starfield, which SHOULD be enough time to complete the gameplay or at least dive deep enough to feel comfortable with hopping into the driver seat in Starfield when that drops a month later. Pokemon Go devs just had a massive layoff, the Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol. 1 will not have mouse and keyboard support on PC and more on today’s Games Fix with Akeem Lawanson.

## Harrison Ford's Favorite Indy Moments Are the Obvious Ones | Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny

The Indiana Jones movies are beloved for many reasons, from Harrison Ford’s everyman hero charm to the deft balance between action, humor, and romance, to the reassuring feeling that, no matter what, Indy is always gonna save the day. But it’s also one of those franchises that is just full of iconic moments which are instantly recognizable, even to people who’ve perhaps never seen the movies that those moments are from.

Now, with Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny hitting theaters for one last Dr. Jones adventure, we spoke to Harrison Ford and the cast of the film about their favorite Indy moments, and why they’re still classic after all these years.

When we asked Ford about the most iconic moment from the series, he said he couldn’t pick just one. “Gosh, you've just opened a Pandora's box for me because there's so many images,” said the actor. “There's the rolling ball, there's the swordsman that Indiana Jones ends up shooting.”
Perhaps not surprisingly, the first sequence from the first movie, Raiders of the Lost Ark, was the source of many of the cast’s picks.

“Oh, the boulder for me, Indy running away from the boulder,” Phoebe Waller-Bridge immediately responded when asked the same question. Her Dial of Destiny costar Ethann Isidore agreed with her.
Of course, you remember that moment as well. Indy has ventured into a Peruvian temple in search of a legendary golden idol. Unfortunately for him, but fortunately for us, he triggers the temple’s ancient booby traps and is forced to exact a thrilling and death-defying escape. It all culminates in a giant boulder heading right down main, with Dr. Jones the only pin in this deadly bowling ball’s way.
For the full story on Harrison Ford’s favorite Indy moments, watch the video.

The Witcher Season 3 Volume 1 reviewed by Jarrod Jones. Streaming on Netflix June 29.
The first five episodes of The Witcher season 3 are a great showcase for the chemistry between Henry Cavill, Anya Chalortra, and Freya Allan, but the series’ strict adherence to its source material pushes them to the side for long stretches of foggy court intrigue, prophecies, and conspiracies, which hardly matches the spectacle of watching Cavill swing a sword at some impressive foul beast.
