  <p id="iHUaQH">Reddit has informed moderators of protesting communities that are still private that they will lose their mod status by the end of the week, according to messages seen by <em>The Verge</em>. If a moderator tells Reddit they are interested in “actively moderating” the subreddit, the company says it will “take your request into consideration.”</p>
<p id="mJBwJE">Here is the full message, which we have confirmed was sent to moderators of at least two subreddits:</p>
<blockquote><p id="xEmjLX">After sending a modmail message on June 27, 2023, your mod team indicated that you do not want to reopen the [name of subreddit] community. This is a courtesy notice to let you know that you will lose moderator status in the community by end of week. If you reply to let us know you’re interested in actively...</p></blockquote>

  <p id="oCLME7">Meta is planning to let people in the EU directly download apps through Facebook ads, setting the company up to eventually compete with Google and Apple’s app stores.</p>
<p id="nn5BbM">The new type of ad is set to start as a pilot with a handful of Android app developers as soon as later this year, I’ve learned. Meta sees an opening to try this thanks to new regulation in the EU <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/24/22994234/eu-antitrust-legislation-dma-digital-markets-act-details">called the Digital Markets Act (DMA)</a> that is expected to go into effect next spring. It deems Apple and Google as “gatekeepers” and requires that they open up their mobile platforms to alternative methods of downloading apps.</p>
<p id="hT6lEH">Android <a href="https://developer.android.com/distribute/marketing-tools/alternative-distribution">technically allows sideloading</a> already, though Google makes it difficult by coupling its in-app billing and licensing with the Play Store, along with...</p>

  <p id="JRwW5B">YouTube is throwing a major wrench into video playback for viewers who are using ad blockers. The company has confirmed to <em>The Verge</em> that it’s currently running “a small experiment globally that urges viewers with ad blockers enabled to allow ads on YouTube or try YouTube Premium.” </p>
<p id="7SW0rL">The statement comes after some people began noticing a new prompt warning that video playback could be cut off if YouTube detects repeated use of ad blocking tools. <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/youtube-three-strikes-policy-block-ads-3340340/"><em>Android Authority earlier reported</em></a> on those tests, which prevent viewers from watching more than three videos when an ad blocker is active.</p>

  <p id="GxvPvM">There is a plethora of new and exciting smartphones that have just come onto the market (or are about to), and it wouldn’t be at all surprising to find out that you are planning to upgrade from your current phone.

<p id="qPirAZ">Whether you want to go with Samsung, Google, or a different manufacturer, trading in your old phone — or selling it — is a smart way to do that, especially since there are those who will decide instead to buy a lightly used phone from an older generation that will suit their needs without breaking the bank. </p>

On Thursday, <a href="https://media.electrifyamerica.com/en-us/releases/223">the company said it will work</a> toward bringing the NACS connector to “existing and future” charging stations by 2025.</p>
<p id="QvPzd0">This doesn’t mean Electrify America is getting rid of the Combined Charging System (CCS), a standard that’s used by EVs from automakers like General Motors, Ford, Nissan, Honda, Hyundai, and others. The company says the CCS plug will still be available alongside the NACS connector. It doesn’t mention the aging CHAdeMO connector that it also offers at its stations, however, which is used by the Nissan Leaf.</p>

You can buy the Steam Deck starting at <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/decktop100">$359.10 ($40 off)</a> for the base model with 64GB of storage, which matches the price we last saw when the handheld first <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/16/23643413/valve-steam-deck-first-sale-ten-percent-off">went on sale in March</a>, and you can save a lot more on the higher-end Decks.</p>

  <p id="WiqvYy">Ordinarily, a recall about products sold way back in the early 2000s probably wouldn’t catch our attention.

So it’s worth calling attention to the fact that <a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2023/Bose-Recalls-Acoustimass-Lifestyle-and-Companion-Bass-Modules-Due-to-Fire-Hazard?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery">Bose is recalling over 1 million bass modules</a> that were part of the company’s Acoustimass, Lifestyle, and Companion home theater systems. </p>

  <p id="P4m8ec">If you’re looking to trade in your Apple product — be it a MacBook, iMac, Mac desktop, iPhone, or iPad — you stand to get a pretty good return. Apple’s tech has a reputation on the secondhand market for retaining value long after release. This speaks to build quality but mostly to Apple’s long-lasting software support for its older products. The trend is positive both for buyers, who will end up with a product that could continue to work for years, and sellers, who will make a good percentage of their original purchase price back.</p>
<p id="cyMhew">There are plenty of ways of trading in your old Apple products for cash. You can easily net an extra $50 to $100 from a sale if you’ve taken care of your tech, as buyers will pay more for products that look...</p>

The Zenfone 10 continues the tradition of providing flagship-grade specs in a “small” package — and yes, a 5.9-inch screen is considered small these days. We’re grading on a curve.</p>
<p id="10tf7W">This year’s Zenfone comes with wireless charging, which was missing from the previous models. It’s a little tricky to get working with some stand-style chargers because of its small stature — the charging coil on the phone seems to be just out of reach on my Belkin Qi charger, and I can only get it charging on a Pixel Stand (2nd gen) if I press it up against the middle of the...</p>

  <p id="74YVF5">Google and Facebook alumna Lexi Reese launched her campaign for US Senate in California Thursday — but you won’t see that announcement on Twitter.</p>
<p id="g5PlAz">Reese, who previously helped lead advertising for both Facebook and Google, said her campaign won’t be using Twitter due to Elon Musk’s leadership at the company. Specifically, Reese cited the platform’s <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/11/12/elon-musk-twitter-racist-tweets-data">reported rise in hate speech</a> and racial slurs since Musk’s 2022 takeover as the reason her campaign is avoiding it.</p>
<p id="WNNTks">“We should all support — as much as possible — people and businesses with whom we share values and motivations,” Reese said in a statement to <em>The Verge</em> Wednesday. “Under Elon Musk’s leadership, Twitter has been increasingly divisive, racist, and sexist. It’s a dumpster fire and...</p>

  <p id="9JRCp0">Warner Bros.

<p id="bniNFh">“This is a credits violation for starters,” Meredith Stiehm, president of Writers Guild of America West, said last month. “But worse, it is disrespectful and insulting to the artists that make the films and TV shows that make their corporation billions.” </p>

  <p class="p--has-dropcap" id="yNJ3bt">We’ve only had two seasons of <em>The Witcher</em> on Netflix, but the show has already had somewhat of an identity crisis. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21026537/the-witcher-netflix-review-henry-cavill">It started off with a bang</a>, with a big, bloody debut that showed exactly why <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21029881/the-witcher-netflix-show-best-books-games-wild-hunt-the-last-wish-sword-of-destiny">the books and games</a> before it were so beloved.
