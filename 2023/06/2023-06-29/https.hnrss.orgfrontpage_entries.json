It was my first job out of university. The work is backend application development for the company's platform. While the work can be interesting at times, I feel like I don't enjoy it anymore. I want to switch into a new software engineering domain that isn't as high-level. I'm fine with switching to any other field, I'm just don't know how to properly make that transition in a way that would allow me to get a job.<p>Currently, I've been doing some personal projects in computer graphics, and I've always enjoyed C programming (I was a TA for my systems programming course in undergrad). I also just completed my Masters in Computer Science.<p>Despite this, I'm having trouble applying for jobs. I usually don't meet any of the requirements, as I don't have actual work experience that the job description expects. And when I do apply, I get rejected before an interview.<p>For those who have switched domains, any advice on how to go about this transition?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a

"title": "Show HN: Open-source code search with OpenAI's function calling", "description": "<p>We're excited to share a tool we've been working on called gpt-code-search. It allows you to search any codebase using natural language locally on your machine. We leverage OpenAI's GPT-4 and function calling to retrieve, search, and answer queries about your code.<p>All you need to do is to install the package with `pip install gpt-code-search`, set up your `OPENAI_API_KEY` as an environment variable, and start asking questions with `gpt-code-search query `.<p>E.g. You can ask questions like \"How do I use the analytics module?\" or \"Document all the API routes related to authentication.\"<p>This is still early and hacked together in the past week, but we wanted to get it out there and get feedback.<p>We utilize OpenAI's function calling to let GPT-4 call certain predefined functions in our library. You do not need to implement any of these functions yourself. These functions are designed to interact with your codebase and return enough context for the LLM to perform code searches without pre-indexing it or uploading your repo to a third party other than OpenAI. So, you only need to run the tool from the directory you want to search.<p>The functions currently available for the LLM to call are:<p>`search_codebase` - searches the codebase using a TF-IDF vectorizer<p>`get_file_tree` - provides the file tree of the codebase<p>`get_file_contents` - provides the contents of a file<p>These functions are implemented in `gpt-code-search` and are triggered by chat completions. The LLM is prompted to utilize the search_codebase and get_file_tree function as needed to find the necessary context to answer your query and then loops as needed to collect more context with the get_file_contents until the LLM responds.<p>A couple of limitations of this approach, GPT cannot load context across multiple files in a single prompt since we are passing in the contents of a single file in each function call. So, GPT repeatedly calls the get_file_contents function to load context from multiple files. This increases the latency and cost of the tool.<p>Another thing we realized as we were building is that the level of search and retrieval is limited by the context window, which refers to the scope of the search conducted by the tool, meaning that we can only search five levels deep in the file system and can only pass in the contents of one file at a time. So it would be best to run the tool from the package/directory closest to the code you want to search.<p>We plan to add support for local vector embeddings to improve search and retrieval. Combining the vector embeddings with function calling should result in much faster and higher quality results.<p>Also, support for other models, chat interactions in the command line, and generating code is already on our backlog!<p>Please check out gpt-code-search and let me know your thoughts, feedback, or suggestions.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a

(<a href=\"https://hivekit.io\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://hivekit.io</a>), a geospatial app platform to track people and vehicles, stream updates, and execute logic based on spatial events.<p>This allows teams in logistics, ride-sharing, delivery, construction, agriculture or AR gaming to fully concentrate on what makes their offering unique without having to worry about the complex infrastructure required to run large scale geospatial apps.<p>We both have a long history of building realtime data services for industries like financial trading, gaming or app development - but there\u2019s something interesting about that. We were repeatedly approached by companies in mines, food delivery networks, ride sharing companies, mines and even farm-equipment manufacturers who were willing to twist our purpose-built solutions into a pretzel to make them work for geospatial tracking.<p>Recognizing this lack of commodity tech, we started meeting with tech folk from around the world, went to onsite visits in English mines, Italian mozzarella plants and German construction yards (one of my favorite parts of the job) and learned that there\u2019s a huge need for a low level realtime data platform for geospatial apps.<p>Hivekit is that platform. It lets you send location and other data from large numbers of vehicles and devices, subscribe to realtime update feeds from apps and websites, store routes and historic data, run scriptable logic in response to spatial events and comes with all the bits needed to build a successful geospatial app such as online status, geofencing, rich auth and permissions, fulltext search or pubsub notifications.<p>But we want to do more:<p>We\u2019re already working on a 3D world map that lets you track all workers, vehicles and objects, add custom UIs and interactive map overlays, pause and rewind time and - most importantly - control your workforce Command & Conquer style: Simply select a few units, assign a task and Hivekit will translate it into individual instructions, send them out and track their progress.<p>But our real goal isn\u2019t for human operators to control their workforce, but for an AI to automate and optimize operations. Now, before everyone gets too excited: this won\u2019t be an AI in the GPT sense, but more \u201ctraditional\u201d ML, optimizing for individual value sets, e.g. \u201censure that my taxi drivers are positioned optimally during the course of the day to ensure the lowest possible time to pick up.\u201d<p>You can read more about our plans here: <a href=\"https://hivekit.io/about/our-vision/\"
