This might be for my fellow oldhead GenXers, those who followed the antics of Beavis and Butthead in the 90s while having the munchies and partaking in activities that cause one to have the munchies. Beavis and Butthead are back, and they are doing the universe in 2022'a <em>Beavis and Butthead Do the Universe</em>.</p><p>Part of their new adventures is going to college, where they get lectured about their <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tiktok-white-women-sing" target="_blank">white privilege</a>. Because what else would you have Beavis and Butthead do in today's America?</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Bevis and Butthead do college. <a href="https://t.co/dodzQljg5b">pic.twitter.com/dodzQljg5b</a><br />— Ian McKelvey (@ian_mckelvey) <a href="https://twitter.com/ian_mckelvey/status/1541825480084672512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 28, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>Beavis and Butthead wind up in what appears to be a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/karine-jean-pierre-florida-history" target="_blank">gender studies course</a>, where they are told they have white privilege. You and I know it's not real, but this is a cartoon. Beavis and Butt-head reacted as you would expect upon finding out they have white privilege, which isn't a real thing. But if it was real, which it's not, but if it was, which it isn't, it sounds f*cking awesome. So, the newly enlightened Beavis and Butthead took off to take advantage of their newfound privilege after being told their whiteness allows them to assume "they can take whatever they want." So they did!</p><p>The real hero in this clip is Gage. The way he bravely interrupts a Black womxn to mansplain away his white privilege because he felt she lacked the motor skills to do so is your new favorite meme.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Meme away, my friends.<br /><br />Meme away. <a href="https://t.co/qZpPDREOJa">pic.twitter.com/qZpPDREOJa</a><br />— Louder with Crowder Dot Com (@LWCnewswire) <a href="https://twitter.com/LWCnewswire/status/1542145336835178505?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 29, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>The true genius of Beavis and Butthead? Whether you are a fan or not (I was always more of the latter), you're going to find yourself laughing like Butt-head for the rest of the day. Either that, or I'm regressing in my old age like they do in Mike Judge's documentary <em>Idiocracy</em>. I'm okay with either.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

I landed on CNN's Laura Coates. The SCOTUS decision is going to ruin everything from IKEA to the American military being able to fight a war.

<blockquote>Admirals, a group of them, and generals also told the Court that, quote, 'diversity in the halls of academia directly affects the performance of theatres in war.</blockquote><p>I believe she is siding with the Kenjai Brown-Jackson judicial "appeal to authority" legal theory, where Supreme Court justices should just follow what "experts" tell them for their rulings. I was under the impression that Supreme Court justices WERE the experts in interpreting the Constitution. <a href="https://hotair.com/ed-morrissey/2023/06/29/breaking-6-3-scotus-tosses-affirmative-action-at-harvard-unc-n561452" target="_blank">But Clarence Thomas sufficiently roasted his colleague her on that</a>.</p><p>Call me an oldhead, but out of anywhere in America, our military is the one place merit and ability should be the SOLE deciding factor.

Have you met their Commander-in-Chief?</p><p>Speaking of the appeal to authority fallacy and people saying what they have to say for political reasons:</p><blockquote>I know that we are short on time, but the monumental consequence of the decision cannot be overstated, everyone from Apple to IKEA to Starbucks joined in on briefs to talk about ‘racial diversity improving decision making by increasing creativity and communication and accuracy,’ some of the largest law firms in our country talked about the private bar and the legal profession benefitting from a diverse pool to recruit.</blockquote><p>Yes, and nothing is stopping them from continuing to do so. Unless what everyone from Apple to IKEA to Starbucks is saying is that the only reason they hired a racially diverse pool of recruits is that the law forced them to. And now that the law may or may not force them to, they're going to... stop doing so?</p><p>Here are two things I've picked up on regarding Supreme Court decisions. The first is that they are never -- if you'll excuse the pun -- as black and white as partisans make them out to be. Yes, that includes our side as well.</p><p>The other is that if corporate media is outraged by a decision? That means it was a good one for America.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Watch: Ricky Gervais mocks man who identifies as an eight-year-old girl on Netflix show

Gervais plays Tony, a reporter struggling with grief after his wife dies of cancer. Not that it's a particularly knee-slapping funny premise, but I believe that's why this is categorized as "dark comedy." </p><p>A lot of the comedy is delivered when Tony goes to interview people for his newspaper, like this bit about a grown-ass man who now claims he's transgender and identifies as an eight-year-old girl. Had this been an episode of <em>Law & Order</em>, this would be advertised as "ripped from the headlines" </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<br /><br />
"You're not trans. You're having a f***ing breakdown. The silly twat thought he caught Down syndrome last year."</blockquote><p>I believe this is what the Brits refer to as "bloody mental." When they aren't trying to call soccer "football." Or trying to make soccer a thing in the first place.</p><p>Though here's the more mental part. When I wrote about this clip three years ago on the site, I said:</p><blockquote>Before all the SCHMOVID insanity, we used to discuss the transgender insanity. So this video is a nice flashback to more comfortable times of crazy.</blockquote><p>Oy, was I wrong about that. Being told wearing a cheap piece of cloth over your face was the only way to leave your house sounds slightly less crazy than a 29-year-old man can identifying as a woman, entering a skateboarding contest for 14-year-olds, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/skateboarding-29-year-old" target="_blank">and then bragging about kicking all their asses</a>.</p><p>Imagine if Tony covered a lawsuit where a 6'2", 260-pound male pledges a sorority as a woman, proceeds to get erections as "she" watches the girls change, asks them about what their vaginas look like, and then<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/wyoming-sorority-lawsuit-dismiss" target="_blank"> the other sorority GIRLS are told if they don't like it they can leave</a>. That one is almost too mental for fiction.</p><p>There is a lot of penis going around. We've gone from laughing at a fat bloke deciding he is a little girl and/or has Down Syndrome, to telling girls if they <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/girl-locker-room-chico-unified" target="_blank">have a problem being exposed to male genitalia</a> in the girls' locker room, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/riley-gaines-congressional-hearing" target="_blank">don't worry because it's not a girl locker room</a> anymore.

</p><p>We never knew how good we had it in 2020. </p><p>That said, and separate from the insane things the Left expects us to accept as reality (or else), <em>After Life</em> is a great show I would highly recommend.

This video is blowing up, so standard viral video disclaimers apply. Should this turn out to be a cleverly done ruse I am falling for, I will be sure to issue a statement declaring "My bad."

<p>At issue is the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-pride-parade" target="_blank">Toronto Pride Parade sponsored by Bud Light</a>. Primo asked if a man was allowed to walk around outside naked, which led to an unintentionally hilarious response from the cop.</p><blockquote>There are naked people running around on the street. That would be some mental health issues.</blockquote><p>Then Primo got more specific and said he saw naked men prancing around while little kids watched. The cop knew exactly what event he was talking about.</p><blockquote>That's the issue every year. That happens every year.</blockquote><p>So it's okay at the Pride parade and not in other situations?</p><blockquote>Exactly.

</p><p>You can hear the sound of defeat in the cop's voice. He knows how the words coming out of his mouth sound. He also knows he only has a few more years left before retirement, and this is what Canadians get for re-electing a walking pile of soy and hair goop like Justin Trudeau.</p><p>People on the rainbow spectrum can't claim to be marginalized when they are granted extra rights that other people do not get. We saw it in America in 2020. Cisnormative people were forced to shut down their businesses, stay locked in their homes, keep their kids away from their friends, and only be allowed to leave their house if they wore three masks in the name of The Science. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/deblasio-tells-covid-contact-tracers-dont-ask-about-protests" target="_self">Ls, Gs, Bs, especially the Ts, and the whole gang were allowed to party in the streets and ignore The Science</a>. Something similar <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/monkeypox-democrat-wapo" target="_self">occurred in San Francisco</a>.</p><p>There are also different laws when it comes to PDA, or pubic display of affection. As a straight, you are not allowed to parade naked in the streets in front of little kids. Nor are you allowed to have a naked girl on a leash on the back of a truck and whip her buttcheeks as the truck drives past children watching a parade. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

## USA Today's sad attempt to cover for Joe Biden confusing "Ukraine" for "Iraq" gets fact-checked into oblivion

Sadly, our president's brain is less cerebellum as much as it is tapioca pudding. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-iraq-ukraine" target="_blank">Joe Biden once again confused "Ukraine" for "Iraq."</a> But don't you worry! The lapdog media is there to cover for him and pretend it didn't happen.</p><p>First, Joey's latest derp. He has <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-national-anthem" target="_blank">really been racking</a> the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-california" target="_blank">derp moments up</a> this week. Of the Russian coup: "Putin's clearly losing the war in IRAQ, he's losing the war at home."</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>And here is the content USA Today journalismers created based on it. I'll give you the screen capture so as not to spoil the fact-check yet. Also, I think the tweet will be deleted with an "apology" they went with the quote given to them by Biden's handlers.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>It's not even the only time Biden made the mistake this week. <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/biden-confused-iraq-ukraine-twice-170229940.html" target="_blank">Yahoo News reports on Tuesday night</a>, Biden referred to the "onslaught on Iraq" at a fundraiser in Maryland. It makes you wonder if this is just Biden having a senior moment (<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/hunter-biden-book-dementia" target="_blank">or what critics call his dementia</a>) and getting wars confused. Or, has Biden been told something about Iraq and he can't remember what he's allowed to talk about and what his staff said, "Whatever you do, DON'T talk about this."</p><p>That's a next week problem. For now, come catch these Community Notes: <em>While presented as a direct quote from the president, he actually said Putin was "losing the war in Iraq, losing the war at home."</em></p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>This is what you get when you elected elderly presidents who are in their seventies and eighties. They get confused on important details. 44-year-old Ron DeSantis wouldn't make this mistake. Just sayin'.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Watch: Dana Carvey, David Spade take turns cracking hilarious "anti-science" jokes at Fauci's expense

Seeing sixty seconds of it used by apolitical comedians who see what you, me, and every other normal person sees is quite refreshing. Dana Carvey and David Spade were holding court on their <a href="https://music.amazon.com/podcasts/123f1e62-057f-4d02-a3b9-edd358cd1a17/fly-on-the-wall-with-dana-carvey-and-david-spade?ref_=dmm_acq_mrn_d_ds_rhsr_z_-c_c_645517264453_t_dsa-1599202036258&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw1_SkBhDwARIsANbGpFt-oHSxeqhSyWqqNRSC3qkLmnziEk8yYH3oOLxEF2Hh60EgJGQXupsaAk2hEALw_wcB" target="_blank">Fly on the Wall podcast</a> when they decided to be anti-The Science.</p><p>It starts with Carvey saying how much he misses SCHMOVID.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>"Okay, I’m sorry, if you’ve had two boosters and two schmaccines, you can get and give SCHMOVID to another guy, who’s had five schmaccines and four boosters," he says impersonating <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/anthony-fauci-attack-chuck-todd" target="_blank">the man who is Literally. The. Science</a>.</p><p> What's the difference between a schmaccine and a booster? "I don't know, It's just more schmaccine, but booster sounds better. Anyway, a guy with twenty-five schmaccines would get and give SCHMOVID to another guy with twenty-five schmaccines. That's why I'm introducing the daily SCHMOVID shot. Every day you get a shot. By the time you get to your car, you have no immunity. But it's a beautiful thirty-nine seconds."</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>As an aside, I'm always going to have a special place in my heart for Dana Carvey. Everyone remembers "their" SNL. My SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE was Carvey, Phil Hartman, Jon Lovitz, Mike Myers, and Dennis Miller. They were one of my introductions to comedy.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>If you share this, no doubt the most insufferable leftist douche you know will show up on your Facebook page to say, "I take my medical advice from DOCTORS and not comedians." Good for you, Skippy. So do I. And if my doctor's medical advice kept being wrong, I'd go to a different doctor. </p><p>That's where I don't think the left and the media (but I repeat myself) realize how much damage they did. This isn't Rob Schneider doing a bit on Fox News. These are two apolitical comedians looking at what happened and seeing things the way average, normal middle-of-the-road people do. </p><p>When you tell Americans that if they wear a mask and take a therapeutic they will save themselves and everyone around them, then keep changing the story and tell Americans they have to take a different therapeutic, then tell them no matter how many shots they take, they will never be safe -- all while limiting how they are allowed to move, work, or let their kids play with friends -- and THEN censor them from asking questions on social media, people are only going to ask more questions.</p><p>Anthony "The Science" Fauci admitted to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/rand-paul-fauci-noble-lies" target="_blank">telling tall tales</a> and admitted to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/anthony-fauci-domestic-flight-mandate" target="_blank">doing things that weren't for The Science reasons</a>. It's funny to laugh about now. But it's also something to never forget.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
