<ul><li>Pacific Four women’s rugby series opens with heavy scoreline</li><li>New Zealand have now won 24 straight against Australia</li></ul><p>The Wallaroos have been no match for world champions New Zealand, crashing to a 50-0 loss to open their Pacific Four women’s rugby series campaign. Any hopes that the Australians were bridging the gap on their trans-Tasman rivals was erased early at Brisbane’s Kayo Stadium on Thursday night with the visitors dominating every aspect of play.</p><p>The tournament also involves Canada and the USA, who the Wallaroos face next with two games in Ottawa. They could be without exciting young fullback Faitala Moleka, with the 18-year-old suffering a leg injury while attempting to stop Alana Bremner’s 74th minute try.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/30/wallaroos-crushed-50-0-as-world-champion-black-ferns-continue-to-dominate">Continue reading...</a>

<p>While the bowler’s injury could seriously hamper Australia, his teammate’s 12th Ashes century suggests there is no need to panic</p><p>One hundred Tests in a row, a feat achieved by no specialist bowler in the game’s history. Beyond that, 122 Tests in a career that has never seen him miss one injured. The Australian men’s team in that span has played 126. So four omissions scattered across 2012 and 2013 remain the only Tests he has missed since his debut in 2011. And then, here, Nathan Lyon pinged a calf, the twang of those strained fibres reverberating forward through the Ashes contest to come.</p><p>The timing, just as he was celebrated for his durability, sucks. Of course it will give another outing to sport’s most tedious guffaw: the jinx, the mozz, the commentator’s curse. There’s nothing duller, that mix of dad joke and solipsism that lets the observer project themselves into the centre of the action where they have no claim to encroach. On pure probability, in any well-attended cricket ground, somebody has just said that a player is batting well a minute before they get out.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/29/nathan-lyons-luck-runs-out-just-as-steve-smiths-begins-to-turn">Continue reading...</a>

<p>At a recent fundraiser he said he’s ‘not big on’ abortion. It’s not pro-choice activists who are out of step with the mainstream; it’s Joe Biden</p><p>A closed-door fundraiser for the very wealthy is a place where a lot of politicians really shine. Among their fellow elites, surrounded by people like them who like them – and are giving them money – Democrats and Republicans alike often become their truest selves. They drop the flesh-pressing affectations, the focused-group soundbites, the stiff smiles. They become something they’re usually not: honest.</p><p>Honest is what Biden was at a similar fundraiser in tony Chevy Chase, Maryland, this past Tuesday, when he told a crowd of his wealthy supporters that he was personally ambivalent about abortion rights. “I’m a practicing Catholic. I’m not big on abortion,” the president said. Nevertheless, he claimed that the compromise Roe v Wade decision on abortion “got it right”.</p><p>Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/29/biden-abortion-rights-dobbs-roe-v-wade">Continue reading...</a>

## The supreme court’s blow to US affirmative action is no coincidence | Eddie R Cole

<p>The court’s ruling reflects a decades-long drive to return higher education to the control of a white privileged class</p><p>On Thursday, in a 6-3 decision, the US supreme court ruled against affirmative action in American colleges and universities. The obvious concern now is whether the ruling will significantly reduce the number of Black, Latinx, and Indigenous students enrolled at elite institutions. But a more dire reality undergirds the court’s decision: it reflects a decades-long drive to return higher education to white, elite control.</p><p>That movement predates affirmative action by at least a century, because no entity impacts American life more than higher education. During the Reconstruction era following emancipation, Black people were allowed to advance in political and various other roles, but white powerbrokers drew a hard line at higher education. On 28 September 1870 the chancellor of the University of Mississippi, John Newton Waddel, declared: “The university will continue to be, what it always has been, an institution exclusively for the education of the white race.”</p><p>Eddie R Cole is an associate professor of education and history at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the author of The Campus Color Line: College Presidents and the Struggle for Black Freedom</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/29/the-supreme-courts-blow-to-us-affirmative-action-is-no-coincidence">Continue reading...</a>

<p>We cannot let our cities descend into islands of privilege amid seas of disadvantage. With the right policies and investments, a better future is possible</p><p>Cities are now home to more than half of the global population, a share that will rise to two-thirds by 2050. That means the forces shaping life in cities now also shape our world as a whole. Cities throughout history have been the great incubators of human progress, through their power to bring us closer together – something we need now more than ever. Many of the answers to our greatest challenges are to be found in reforming our cities, but if we fail to take action, cities will magnify the perils that lie ahead.</p><p>The populist politics of recent years has been tinged with resentment against global metropolises such as London and New York. These cities have boomed while others have struggled. But while the gulf between thriving cities and everywhere else has widened, so too has the disparity within these cities. Inequality has risen in most metropolitan areas in the US since 1980, but it has risen fastest in large, thriving cities such as New York, San Francisco and Chicago, where it is now much higher than the national average. Wages for high-skilled knowledge workers in these places have soared, but pay for the low-skilled service workers supporting them has languished, a gulf that is compounded by the rapidly rising cost of living in these cities.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2023/jun/29/how-to-reduce-the-damage-done-by-gentrification">Continue reading...</a>
