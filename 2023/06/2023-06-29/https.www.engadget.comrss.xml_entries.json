The latest measure is one of the first steps that the developers are taking to combat <em>Modern Warfare II</em> and <em>Warzone 2.0 </em>hackers who use banned tools (for instance, wallhacks) to learn extra information and gain an unfair advantage over others.</p><p>When Activision's systems detect or suspect a cheater, a <a href=\"https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/hallucinations\"><ins>&quot;hallucination&quot;</ins></a> may be deployed. These won't impact legitimate players at all and they're designed to disorient hackers. Here's the really clever part: each hallucination is a clone of a real player in the match, according to the Ricochet anti-cheat team. Hallucinations move, look and interact with the world just as a human player would to trick the cheater into thinking they've encountered a genuine opponent.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Ricochet says cheaters won't be able to tell the difference between a hallucination and a genuine player at first glance (the team notes that, in the image above, there's one hallucination and one real player). Hallucinations emit the same kinds of hidden information that cheaters receive for legitimate players through their illicit tools. Hallucinations will also be deployed close to suspected cheaters. If a shady-looking player interacts with a hallucination at all, then boom, they'll out themself as a hacker.</p><figure><img alt=\"Call of Duty screenshot showing the outline of an enemy player through a wall and information about their weapon.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/88f51260-16b8-11ee-bff8-f4bc6e5d61ed\" style=\"height: 1080px; width: 1920px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Activision</div></figure><p>On the other hand, Ricochet has wound down one of its hacker mitigations.

The studio <a href=\"https://nianticlabs.com/news/organizational-update?hl=en\">published</a> an \u201corganizational update\u201d (after the internal memo was <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/niantic-layoffs-pokemon-go-marvel-world-of-heroes-1850591267\">leaked to</a><em>Kotaku</em>) announcing that it would let go of 230 employees. In addition, the company is shutting down its Los Angeles studio and canceling two licensed games: <em>NBA All-World</em> and <em>Marvel: World of Heroes</em>. The only good news for fans is that <em>Pok\u00e9mon Go</em>, still its flagship product, will live to fight another day.</p><p>\u201cI have made the decision to narrow our focus for mobile game investments, concentrating on first party games that most strongly embody our core values of location and local social communities,\u201d wrote CEO John Hanke. \u201cThe mobile gaming market is very mature and only the best and most differentiated titles have a chance to succeed. We also want to increase our focus on building for the emerging class of MR devices and future AR glasses.\u201d</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Although nobody likes hearing about layoffs, Hanke\u2019s letter seems forthcoming and candid about the company\u2019s challenges and the mistakes he and the leadership team made. He attributes the downsizing to the studio growing its expenses faster than its revenue. \u201cIn the wake of the revenue surge we saw during Covid, we grew our headcount and related expenses in order to pursue growth more aggressively, expanding existing game teams, our AR platform work, new game projects and roles that support our products and our employees. Post Covid, our revenue returned to pre-Covid levels and new projects in games and platform have not delivered revenues commensurate with those investments.\u201d The CEO expects the reductions to \u201cbring expenses and revenue back into line\u201d without shuttering its most valuable property.</p><p>On that topic, Hanke said, \u201cThe top priority is to keep <em>Pok\u00e9mon Go</em> healthy and growing as a forever game. While we made some adjustments to the <em>Pok\u00e9mon Go</em> team, our investment in the product and team continues to grow.\u201d The phone-based AR game launched in the summer of 2016 and instantly became a viral sensation; it also enjoyed a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/pokemon-go-remote-raids-142038163.html\">resurgence in popularity</a> during pandemic lockdowns as homebound gamers used the explorative game as an excuse to connect with a world beyond their overly familiar four walls. Just last year, the studio launched a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/niantic-campfire-social-app-pokemon-go-launch-170036252.html\">social app for the game</a> that lets players organize and chat.</p><p>The letter adds that the AR market \u201cdeveloping more slowly than anticipated\u201d was another factor. Niantic\u2019s games would be ideal for on-the-go AR, which the industry eventually expects to materialize as smart glasses that can pass for standard prescription specs. However, as <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-vision-pro-hands-on-a-new-milestone-for-mixed-reality-060943291.html\">Apple\u2019s Vision Pro</a> made clear, that future is still likely a ways off. Today\u2019s wearable AR, also including the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/meta-quest-pro-review-a-next-gen-headset-for-the-vr-faithful-specs-price-130045313.html\">Meta Quest Pro</a>, is home-based gear designed for work and entertainment in the comfort of your home or office. Although adaptations of <em>Pok\u00e9mon Go</em> types of experiences may work there to some degree, the company\u2019s trademark approach is tailor-made for AR that isn\u2019t yet available. Niantic may well end up waiting five to 10 years to see consumer-friendly versions of that type of augmented reality \u2014 and apparently, that required some reconfiguring.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/pokemon-go-developer-niantic-is-laying-off-230-employees-180438129.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/pokemon-go-developer-niantic-is-laying-off-230-employees-180438129.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-29 18:04:38+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Watch Annapurna Interactive's showcase here at 3PM ET", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/annapurna-interactive/\"><ins>Annapurna Interactive</ins></a> has a terrific track record, and we'll soon learn more about what's next from the highly regarded publisher.

In Australia, where the law <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/australia-passes-law-google-facebook-pay-for-news-062149942.html\">requires that some online services pay for news</a>, Google has negotiated deals that keep its news features available and avoid falling under the law's requirements.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The company maintains that it believes a &quot;vibrant journalism industry&quot; is crucial, and has <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/news/shared-responsibility-quality-journalism/\">floated</a> policy ideas it believes will help.

The approach dictated by C-18 purportedly leads to &quot;uncertainty&quot; for product strategy and &quot;uncapped&quot; financial penalties.</p><p>The move comes just days after Meta said it would remove access to all news content from Facebook and Instagram in Canada. When it balked at similar moves by Australia and New Zealand, it claimed that such legislation lets the government unfairly decide who has to pay, and how much publishers get paid.</p><p>As with Meta, Google is using the threat of blocking news as a bargaining tool.

However, the company has gone through a lot of pain getting to that point.</p><p>After several <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2013-09-05-virgin-galactic-spaceshiptwo-completes-second-test-flight.html\">successful tests</a> of its SpaceShipTwo spaceplane aboard the mothership WhiteKnightTwo back in 2013, Virgin Galactic's VSS Enterprise <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2015-07-28-ntsb-spaceshiptwo-crash-findings.html\">crashed in 2014</a>, killing the co-pilot and seriously injuring the pilot. Flight testing resumed with VSS Unity's glide test back in 2016, and the ship finally <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-13-virgin-galactic-spaceshiptwo-reaches-space.html\">reached space</a> in 2018.&nbsp;</p><p>The company's first fully crewed spaceflight <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-richard-branson-spaceflight-complete-154012847.html\">took place</a> in 2021, when Unity hit an altitude of 53.4 miles with founder Richard Branson on board. However, commercial service was delayed <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-again-delays-space-tourism-flights-to-second-quarter-2023-084540843.html\">multiple times</a> for different reasons, most recently due to issues in upgrading the mothership VMS Eve.</p><p>From a financial perspective, the launch was crucial for Virgin Galactic. With no paying customers until now, the company has lost money for years, including more than $500 million in 2022 alone. It advertises seats at $450,000 per ticket, and previously set a goal of having 1,000 reservations prior to its first commercial launch.&nbsp;</p><p>Virgin Galactic's main rival in the suborbital tourism space race is Blue Origin, which uses a conventional rocket rather than an airplane mothership. Blue Origin CEO (and Amazon founder) Jeff Bezos has said that Virgin Galactic fails to deliver a true spaceflight experience, compared to Blue Origin's system that tops 62 miles in altitude, past the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line often used to mark the beginning of space. Others <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/edge-space\">consider</a> 50 miles the threshold.</p><p>Blue Origin has had problems of its own. Last year, one of its New Shepard rockets suffered from a booster failure about a minute after takeoff, forcing the company to deploy its escape system for the uncrewed capsule, which worked as designed.&nbsp;</p><p>Another rival, SpaceX, offers a far different experience \u2014 its Falcon 1 rocket and Crew Dragon capsule take customers into a true orbit. SpaceX has even flown a private crew to the International Space Station on a 10-day mission, reportedly for a $55 million fee.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-completes-its-first-commercial-spaceflight-161701356.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-completes-its-first-commercial-spaceflight-161701356.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-29 16:17:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "All the big tech layoffs of 2023", "description": "<p>The tech industry is reeling from the combination of a rough economy, the COVID-19 pandemic and some obvious business missteps.

The move is part of a more targeted approach to fostering podcasts with optimized resources for creators and shows. The company is also combining its Gimlet and Parcast production teams into a renewed Spotify Studios division.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><h2>GrubHub layoffs</h2><p>GrubHub has faced intense pressure from both the economy and competitors like Uber, and that led it to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/grubhub-lays-off-15-percent-of-its-employees-190005627.html\">lay off 15 percent of its workforce</a> in June, or roughly 400 staff. This came just weeks after outgoing CEO Adam DeWitt officially left the food delivery service. New chief executive Howard Migdal claims the job cuts will help the company remain &quot;competitive.&quot;</p><h2>Embracer Group layoffs</h2><p>Game publishing giant Embracer Group <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/embracer-announces-layoffs-and-game-cancellations-after-a-2-billion-deal-falls-through-144311854.html\">announced plans for layoffs</a> in June as part of a major restructuring effort meant to cut costs. The company didn't say how many of its 17,000 employees would be effected, but expected the overhaul to continue through March. The news came soon after Embracer revealed that it lost a $2 billion deal with an unnamed partner despite a verbal agreement.</p><h2>Sonos layoffs</h2><p>Sonos has struggled to turn a profit as of late, and it's cutting costs to get back on track. The company said in June that it would <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sonos-lays-off-7-percent-of-its-workforce-161529844.html\">lay off 7 percent of staff</a>, or roughly 130 jobs. It also planned to offload real estate and rethink program spending. CEO Patrick Spence said there were &quot;continued headwinds&quot; that included shrinking sales.</p><h2>Plex layoffs</h2><p>Plex may be many users' go-to app for streaming both local and online media, but that hasn't helped its fortunes. The company laid off <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/29/plex-layoffs-advertising-slowdown/?guccounter=1\">roughly 20 percent of employees</a> in June, or 37 people. Most of the affected people are in its Personal Media unit. Plex is reportedly feeling the blow from an ad market slowdown, and is eager to cut costs and turn a profit.</p><h2></h2><h2>May</h2><h2></h2><figure><img alt=\"An employee works at Shopify's headquarters in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, October 22, 2018.

In May, the company laid off <a href=\"https://news.shopify.com/important-team-and-business-changes\">20 percent of its workforce</a> and sold its logistics business to Flexport. Founder Tobi L\u00fctke characterized the job cuts as necessary to &quot;pay unshared attention&quot; to Shopify's core mission, and an acknowledgment that the firm needed to be more efficient now that the &quot;stable economic boom times&quot; were over.</p><h2>Polestar layoffs</h2><p>Polestar delayed production of its first electric SUV (the Polestar 3) in May, and that had repercussions for its workforce. The Volvo spinoff brand said in May that it would <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-polestar-3-and-volvo-ex90-are-both-delayed-until-2024-210052700.html\">cut 10 percent of its workforce</a> to lower costs as it faced reduced manufacturing expectations and a rough economy. Volvo needed more time for software development and testing that also pushed back the EX90, Polestar said.</p><h2>SoundCloud layoffs</h2><p>SoundCloud followed up last year's extensive layoffs with more this May. The streaming audio service said it would <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/soundcloud-will-lay-off-eight-percent-of-its-staff-in-hopes-of-becoming-profitable-204510023.html\">shed 8 percent of its staff</a> in a bid to become profitable in 2023. <em>Billboard</em> sources claim the company hopes to be profitable by the fourth quarter of the year.</p><h2>April</h2><h2></h2><figure><img alt=\"Lyft logo is seen in this illustration taken June 27, 2022. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-07/63baa330-085d-11ed-bf69-3a111366367f\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Dado Ruvic / reuters</div></figure><h2>Lyft layoffs</h2><p>Lyft laid off 13 percent of staff in November 2022, but took further steps in April. The ridesharing company said it was <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/lyft-is-laying-off-26-percent-of-employees-172550913.html\">laying off 1,072 workers</a>, or about 26 percent of its headcount. It comes just weeks after an executive shuffle that replaced CEO Logan Green with former Amazon exec David Risher, who said the company needed to streamline its business and refocus on drivers and passengers. Green previously said Lyft needed to boost its spending to compete with Uber.</p><h2>Dropbox layoffs</h2><p>Cloud storage companies aren't immune to the current financial climate. In April, Dropbox said it would <a href=\"https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/company/a-message-from-drew\">lay off 500 employees</a>, or roughly 16 percent of its team. Co-founder Drew Houston pinned the cuts on the combination of a rough economy, a maturing business and the &quot;urgency&quot; to hop on the growing interest in AI.  While the company is profitable, its growth is slowing and some investments are &quot;no longer sustainable,&quot; Houston said.&nbsp;</p><h2>March</h2><h2></h2><figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-06/462235c0-9102-11e9-b76d-3fd26de648d8\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h2>Roku layoffs</h2><p>Roku shed 200 jobs <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/roku-layoffs-streaming-2022-201541882.html\">at the end of 2022</a>, but it wasn't done. The streaming platform creator laid off <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/roku-will-lay-off-another-200-workers-132908304.html\">another 200 employees</a> in March 2023. As before, the company argued that it needed to curb growing expenses and concentrate on those projects that would have the most impact. Roku has been struggling with the one-two combination of a rough economy and the end of a pandemic-fueled boom in streaming video.</p><h2>Lucid Motors layoffs</h2><p>If you thought luxury EV makers would be particularly susceptible to economic turmoil, you guessed correctly. Lucid Motors said in March that it would lay off <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/lucid-motors-is-laying-off-1300-workers-to-reduce-expenses-090908953.html\">18 percent of its workforce</a>, or about 1,300 people. The marque is still falling short of production targets, and these cuts reportedly help deal with &quot;evolving business needs and productivity improvements.&quot; The cuts are across the board, too, and include both executives as well as contractors.</p><h2>Meta (Facebook) layoffs</h2><p>Meta slashed 11,000 jobs <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/meta-mass-layoffs-facebook-111406126.html\">in fall 2022</a>, but it wasn't finished. In March 2023, the company unveiled plans to lay off <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/zuckerberg-touts-year-of-efficiency-as-meta-lays-off-an-additional-10000-workers-131957819.html\">another 10,000 workers</a> in a further bid to cut costs. The first layoffs affected its recruiting team, but it shrank its technology teams <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/meta-begins-its-latest-round-of-layoffs-145019127.html\">in late April</a> and its business groups <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/meta-is-laying-off-employees-for-the-third-time-in-less-than-three-months-174112198.html\">in late May</a>. The Facebook owner is hoping to streamline its operations by reducing management layers and asking some leaders to take on work previously reserved for the rank and file. It may take a while before Meta's staff count grows again \u2014 it doesn't expect to lift a hiring freeze until sometime after it completes its restructuring effort in late 2023.</p><h2>February</h2><h2></h2><figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/0d02d0e0-b856-11ed-bdff-3b6b0c6afd32\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h2>Rivian layoffs</h2><p>Rivian conducted layoffs <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rivian-ceo-memo-cost-cutting-layoffs-205556718.html\">in 2022</a>, but that wasn't enough to help the fledgling EV brand's bottom line. The company laid off another <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rivian-layoffs-184047174.html\">six percent of its employees</a> in February, or about 840 workers. It's still fighting to achieve profitability, and the production shortfall from supply chain issues hasn't helped matters. CEO RJ Scaringe says the job cuts will help Rivian focus on the &quot;highest impact&quot; aspects of its business.</p><h2>Zoom layoffs</h2><p>Zoom was a staple of remote work culture <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/zoom-earnings-214253721.html\">at the pandemic's peak</a>, so it's no surprise that the company is cutting back now that people are returning to offices. The video calling firm said in February it was <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/zoom-layoffs-202256575.html\">laying off roughly 1,300 employees</a>, or 15 percent of its personnel. As CEO Eric Yuan put it, the company didn't hire &quot;sustainably&quot; as it dealt with its sudden success. The layoffs are reportedly necessary to help survive a difficult economy. The management team is offering more than just apologies, too. Yuan is cutting his salary by 98 percent for the next fiscal year, while all other executives are losing 20 percent of their base salaries as well as their fiscal 2023 bonuses.</p><h2>Yahoo layoffs</h2><p>Engadget's parent company Yahoo isn't immune to layoffs. The internet brand said in February that it would lay off <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2023/02/09/yahoo-layoffs-2023-tech-media-companies\">over 20 percent of its workforce</a> throughout 2023, or more than 1,600 people. Most of those cuts, or about 1,000 positions, took place immediately. CEO Jim Lanzone didn't blame the layoffs on economic conditions, however. He instead pitched it as a restructuring of the advertising technology unit as it shed an unprofitable business in favor of a successful one. Effectively, Yahoo is bowing out of direct competition in with Google and Meta in the ad market.</p><h2>Dell layoffs</h2><p>The pandemic recovery and a grim economy have hit PC makers particularly hard, and Dell is feeling the pain more than most. It laid off <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/dell-layoffs-144303513.html\">five percent of its workforce</a> in early February, or about 6,650 employees, after a brutal fourth quarter where computer shipments plunged an estimated 37 percent. Past cost-cutting efforts weren't enough, Dell said \u2014 the layoffs and a streamlined organization were reportedly needed to get back on track.</p><h2>Deliveroo layoffs</h2><p>Food delivery services flourished while COVID-19 kept people away from restaurants, and at least some are feeling the sting now that people are willing to dine out again. Deliveroo is <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3d6699dc-3184-47dd-a3f8-0e4b4c1dd37b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Deliveroo+UK&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzZDY2OTlkYy0zMTg0LTQ3ZGQtYTNmOC0wZTRiNGMxZGQzN2IiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWxpdmVyb28uY28udWsvbW9yZS9uZXdzLWFydGljbGVzL3dpbGwtc2h1LW1lc3NhZ2UtdG8tZGVsaXZlcm9vLWVtcGxveWVlcyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZWJiNDkzNzEtNTM5Ni00Y2JlLTlkZGQtNTZkYTQyYTRmMzc3In0&amp;signature=AQAAAeGBlzRDr0JyeLhwAuI8oqPUGfFz3VvJQ84vA3mdPgQ7&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fdeliveroo.co.uk%2Fmore%2Fnews-articles%2Fwill-shu-message-to-deliveroo-employees\">laying off about 350 workers</a>, or nine percent of its workforce. &quot;Redeployments&quot; will bring this closer to 300, according to founder Will Shu. The justification is familiar: Deliveroo hired rapidly to handle &quot;unprecedented&quot; pandemic-related growth, according to Shu, but reportedly has to cut costs as it deals with a troublesome economy.</p><h2>DocuSign layoffs</h2><p>DocuSign may be familiar to many people who've signed documents online, but that hasn't spared it from the impact of a harsh economic climate. The company said in mid-February that it was <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1261333/000126133323000007/docu-20230216.htm\">laying off 10 percent of its workforce</a>. While it didn't disclose how many people that represented, the company had 7,461 employees at the start of 2022. Most of those losing their jobs work in DocuSign's worldwide field organization.</p><h2>GitLab layoffs</h2><p>You may not know GitLab, but its DevOps (development and operations) platform underpins work at tech brands like NVIDIA and T-Mobile \u2014 and shrinking business at its clients is affecting its bottom line. GitLab is <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/02/09/gitlab-news/\">laying off seven percent of employees</a>, or roughly 114 people. Company chief Sid Sijbrandij said the problematic economy meant customers were taking a &quot;more conservative approach&quot; to software investment, and that his company's previous attempts to refocus spending weren't enough to counter these challenges.</p><h2>GoDaddy layoffs</h2><p>GoDaddy conducted layoffs early in the pandemic, when it cut over 800 workers for its retail-oriented Social platform. In February this year, however, it took broader action. The web service provider laid off <a href=\"https://aboutus.godaddy.net/newsroom/press-releases/press-release-details/2023/A-message-from-GoDaddy-CEO-Aman-Bhutani/default.aspx\">eight percent of its workforce</a>, or more than 500 people, across all divisions. Chief Aman Bhutani claimed other forms of cost-cutting hadn't been enough to help the company navigate an &quot;uncertain&quot; economy, and that this reflected efforts to further integrate acquisitions like Main Street Hub.</p><h2>Twilio layoffs</h2><p>Twilio eliminated over 800 jobs in September 2022, but it made deeper cuts as 2023 got started. The cloud communications brand <a href=\"https://www.twilio.com/blog/restructuring-twilio\">laid off 17 percent of staff</a>, or roughly 1,500 people, in mid-February. Like so many other tech firms, Twillio said that past cost reduction efforts weren't enough to endure an unforgiving environment. It also rationalized the layoffs as necessary for a streamlined organization.</p><h2>January</h2><h2></h2><figure><img alt=\"An exterior view of building BV100, during a tour of Google's new Bay View Campus in Mountain View, California, U.S. May 16, 2022.

CEO Sundar Pichai wasn't shy about the reasoning: Alphabet had been hiring for a &quot;different economic reality,&quot; and was restructuring to focus on the internet giant's most important businesses. The decision hit the company's Area 120 incubator<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-lays-off-most-employees-area-120-in-house-incubator-154329887.html\"> particularly hard</a>, with the majority of the unit's workers losing their jobs. Sub-brands like Intrinsic (robotics) and Verily (health) also shed significant portions of their workforce in the days before the mass layoffs. Waymo has <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/alphabet-layoffs-waymo-idCAKBN2V33PW\">conducted</a> two rounds of layoffs that shed 209 people, or eight percent of its force.</p><h2>Amazon layoffs</h2><p>Amazon had already<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazon-layoffs-report-191003720.html\"> outlined layoff plans</a> last fall, but expanded those cuts in early January when it said it would<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazon-expanded-job-cuts-18000-102059372.html\"> eliminate 18,000 jobs</a>, most of them coming from retail and recruiting teams. It added <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazon-will-lay-off-another-9000-employees-in-the-coming-weeks-152653190.html\">another 9,000 people</a> to the layoffs in March, and in April said <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazon-lays-off-more-than-100-employees-across-its-gaming-divisions-190634108.html\">over 100 gaming employees</a> were leaving. To no one's surprise, CEO Andy Jassy blamed both an &quot;uncertain economy&quot; and rapid hiring in recent years. Amazon<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazon-q1-2021-210221698.html\"> benefited tremendously</a> from the pandemic as people shifted to online shopping, but its<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazon-q1-2022-earnings-growth-235926922.html\"> growth is slowing</a> as people return to in-person stores.</p><h2>Coinbase layoffs</h2><p>Coinbase was one of the larger companies impacted by the crypto market's 2022 downturn, and that carried over into the new year. The cryptocurrency exchange<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/coinbase-lay-offs-reduced-expenses-153433234.html\"> laid off 950 people</a> in mid-January, just months after it<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/coinbase-job-cuts-layoffs-150838290.html\"> slashed 1,100 roles</a>. This is one of the steepest proportionate cuts among larger tech brands \u2014 Coinbase offloaded about a fifth of its staff. Chief Brian Armstrong said his outfit needed the layoffs to shrink operating expenses and survive what he previously described as a &quot;crypto winter,&quot; but that also meant canceling some projects that were less likely to succeed.</p><h2>IBM layoffs</h2><p>Layoffs sometimes stem more from corporate strategy shifts than financial hardship, and IBM provided a classic example of this in 2023. The computing pioneer<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-25/ibm-to-cut-about-3-900-workers-still-hiring-in-higher-growth-areas?sref=10lNAhZ9\"> axed 3,900 jobs</a> in late January after offloading both its AI-driven Watson Health business and its infrastructure management division (now Kyndryl) in the fall. Simply put, those employees had nothing to work on as IBM pivoted toward cloud computing.</p><h2>Microsoft layoffs</h2><p>Microsoft started its second-largest wave of layoffs in company history when it signaled it would<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-confirms-layoffs-151816595.html\"> cut 10,000 jobs</a> between mid-January and the end of March. Like many other tech heavyweights, it was trimming costs as customers<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-q2-fy23-earnings-report-211718819.html\"> scaled back their spending</a> (particularly on Windows and devices) during the pandemic recovery. The reductions were especially painful for some divisions \u2014 they reportedly<a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/microsoft-has-laid-off-entire-teams-behind-virtual-mixed-reality-and-hololens\"> gutted the HoloLens and mixed reality teams</a>, while 343 Industries is believed to be<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/343-industries-halo-unreal-engine-202439779.html\"> rebooting Halo development</a> after losing dozens of workers. GitHub is <a href=\"https://siliconangle.com/2023/02/09/github-gitlab-announce-job-cuts/\">cutting 10 percent</a> of its team, or roughly 300 people.</p><h2>PayPal layoffs</h2><p>PayPal has been one of the healthier large tech companies, having<a href=\"https://s201.q4cdn.com/231198771/files/doc_financials/2022/q3/PYPL-Q3-22-Earnings-Release.pdf\"> beaten expectations</a> in its third quarter last year. Still, it hasn't been immune to a tough economy. The online payment firm unveiled plans at the end of January to<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/paypal-is-laying-off-2000-employees-212108119.html\"> lay off 2,000 employees</a>, or seven percent of its total worker base. CEO Dan Schulman claimed the downsizing would keep costs in check and help PayPal focus on &quot;core strategic priorities.&quot;</p><h2>Salesforce layoffs</h2><p>Salesforce set the tone for 2023 when it warned it would<a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001108524/000110852423000003/crm-20230104.htm\"> lay off 8,000 employees</a>, or about 10 percent of its workforce, just four days into the new year. While the cloud software brand thrived during the pandemic with rapidly growing revenue, it admitted that it hired too aggressively during the boom and couldn't maintain that staffing level while the economy was in decline.</p><h2>SAP layoffs</h2><p>Business software powerhouse SAP saw a steep 68 percent drop in profit at the end of 2022, and it started 2023 by<a href=\"https://news.sap.com/2023/01/sap-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2022-results/\"> laying off 2,800 staff</a> to keep its business healthy. Unlike some big names in tech, though, SAP didn't blame excessive pandemic-era hiring for the cutback. Instead, it characterized the initiative as a &quot;targeted restructuring&quot; for a company that still expected accelerating growth in 2023.</p><h2>Spotify layoffs</h2><p>Spotify spent aggressively in recent years as it<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-05-spotify-podcasts-the-ringer.html\"> expanded its podcast empire</a>, but it quickly put a stop to that practice as 2023 began. The streaming music service said in late January that it would<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/spotify-will-lay-off-6-percent-of-employees-130337498.html\"> lay off 6 percent of its workforce</a> (9,800 people worked at Spotify as of the third quarter) alongside a restructuring effort that included the departure of content chief Dawn Ostroff. While there were more Premium subscribers than ever in 2022, the company also<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/spotify-reaches-205-million-premium-subscribers-as-losses-mount-122503157.html\"> suffered steep losses</a> \u2014 CEO Daniel Ek said he was &quot;too ambitious&quot; investing before the revenue existed to support it.</p><h2>Wayfair layoffs</h2><p>Amazon isn't the only major online retailer scaling back in 2023. Wayfair said in late January that it would<a href=\"https://investor.wayfair.com/news/news-details/2023/Wayfair-Announces-Update-to-Cost-Efficiency-Plan-and-Business-Performance/default.aspx\"> lay off 1,750 team members</a>, or 10 percent of its global headcount. About 1,200 of those were corporate staff cut in a bid to &quot;eliminate management layers&quot; and otherwise help the company become leaner and nimbler. Wayfair had been cutting costs since August 2022 (including 870 positions), but saw the layoffs as helping it reach break-even earnings sooner than expected.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech-layoffs-2023-152856197.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/big-tech-layoffs-2023-152856197.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-29 15:28:56+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "A self-emptying Shark robot vacuum is half off right now", "description": "<p>Shark makes some of the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-robot-vacuums-130010426.html\">best robot vacuums</a> around and you can currently save quite a bit on a self-emptying model.

The EV-oriented brand has <a href=\"https://media.polestar.com/us/en/media/pressreleases/669138\">confirmed</a> that it will use Tesla's NACS connector in North America.

Now it\u2019s possible to find something that meets most of your needs for as little as $160. However, navigating the budget phone market can be tricky. Many options that look good on paper often aren\u2019t great in use, and some handsets will end up costing you more when you consider many come with restrictive storage. This guide will help you find a bargain and highlight our top picks for the best cheap phones you can buy right now.</p><h2>What to look for in a cheap phone</h2><p>For this guide, our recommendations cost between $100 and $300. Anything less and you might as well go buy a dumb phone or high-end calculator instead. Since they\u2019re meant to be more affordable than their flagship and midrange siblings, entry-level smartphones involve compromises; the cheaper a device, the lower your expectations around performance and experience should be. For that reason, the best advice I can give is to spend as much as you can afford. In this price range, even $50 or $100 more can get you a dramatically better product.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Second, you should know what you want most from a phone. When buying a budget device, you may need to sacrifice a decent camera for a long-lasting battery or trade a high-resolution display for a faster processor. That\u2019s just what comes with the territory, but knowing your priorities will make it easier to find the right phone.</p><p>It\u2019s also worth noting some features can be hard to find on cheap handsets. For instance, you won\u2019t need to search far for a device with all-day battery life \u2014 but if you want a great camera, you\u2019re better off shelling out for one of the recommendations in our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-engadget-guide-to-the-best-midrange-smartphones-120050366.html\">midrange smartphone guide</a>, which all come in at $600 or less. Wireless charging and waterproofing also aren\u2019t easy to find in this price range and forget about a fast processor. On the bright side, all our recommendations come with headphone jacks, so you won\u2019t need to get <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-headphones-150030794.html\">wireless headphones</a>.</p><p>iOS is also off the table, since the most affordable handset Apple sells is the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/iphone-se-3-2022-review-battery-life-camera-sample-touch-id-home-button-130047678.html\">$400 iPhone SE</a>. That leaves Android as the only option. Thankfully, in 2023, there\u2019s little to complain about Google\u2019s OS \u2013 and you may even prefer it to iOS. Lastly, keep in mind most Android manufacturers typically offer far less robust software support for their budget devices. In some cases, your new phone may only receive one major Android update and a year or two of security patches beyond that. That applies to the OnePlus and Motorola recommendations on our list. If you\u2019d like to keep your phone for as long as possible, Samsung has the best software policy of any Android manufacturer in the budget space, offering <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-four-years-security-updates-152303907.html\">four years of security updates</a> on all of its devices.</p><h2>The best budget phone: OnePlus Nord N30 5G</h2><h2></h2><p></p><h2></h2><p>The recently announced $300 <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9PbmVQbHVzLVVubG9ja2VkLUR1YWwtU0lNLUNoYXJnaW5nLUNocm9tYXRpYy9kcC9CMEMyMkJSR0xHP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTFtaC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNzkzYTJjNzMtNWFjMy00MjBmLWI2MGItN2RlYzgxMzJiYzk0In0&amp;signature=AQAAARhP0N9sDKCPcpMx_sMjnsFQ6nueDfOOwhJZ6Ku3hZlU&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FOnePlus-Unlocked-Dual-SIM-Charging-Chromatic%2Fdp%2FB0C22BRGLG\">OnePlus Nord N30 5G</a> offers the best value of any of the smartphones on our list. No other phone in the price bracket features a processor as fast as the N30\u2019s Snapdragon 695 5G. Moreover, OnePlus has specced the N30 with a generous 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, meaning you probably won\u2019t need to budget for a microSD card or cloud storage. It also comes with a 120Hz IPS display, a feature that\u2019s great for both gaming and everyday use. Best of all, the N30 ships with a 50W power adapter that you can use to get a full day of battery life in 30 minutes. The N30 would be almost perfect if it had waterproofing and OnePlus had committed to pushing more than one major Android update to the phone.</p><h2>Another great option: Samsung Galaxy A14 5G</h2><h2></h2><p></p><h2></h2><p>Don\u2019t let the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TQU1TVU5HLVVubG9ja2VkLVNtYXJ0cGhvbmUtRXhwYW5kYWJsZS1JbmZpbml0ZS9kcC9CMEJMVzQ3SDNNP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTFtaC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNzkzYTJjNzMtNWFjMy00MjBmLWI2MGItN2RlYzgxMzJiYzk0In0&amp;signature=AQAAAd16NBa1HxX_jWXZ2x7rLtaBahAYAJ4dF9sSR-E7yf4A&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSAMSUNG-Unlocked-Smartphone-Expandable-Infinite%2Fdp%2FB0BLW47H3M\">Samsung Galaxy A14 5G\u2019s</a> modest price and uninspired design fool you \u2014 it has a lot to offer. For $200, you get a phone that is surprisingly fast and features a competent camera. Additionally, it has NFC connectivity for contactless payments, something you won\u2019t find on a lot of phones in this price range. Battery life is also excellent, coming in at two days with moderate use. Plus, there\u2019s that great software policy I mentioned above, with Samsung promising to support the A14 with two major Android updates and four years of security patches. The only thing missing from the A14 is waterproofing, so you may want to opt for something sturdier if you live by the beach or like to doomscroll in the tub.</p><h2>An ultra-budget pick: Samsung Galaxy A03s</h2><h2></h2><p></p><h2></h2><p>If you want to spend as little as possible but still want something from a reputable brand, the $160 <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9FbGVjdHJvbmljcy1VbmxvY2tlZC1TbWFydHBob25lLUV4cGFuZGFibGUtSW5maW5pdGUvZHAvQjA5TVpCVE1RUT90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby0xbWgtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijc5M2EyYzczLTVhYzMtNDIwZi1iNjBiLTdkZWM4MTMyYmM5NCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAbjWPmuh2Nyzb33UfVqhtWaK5gq0fUHrb0NDtJMPUTnX&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FElectronics-Unlocked-Smartphone-Expandable-Infinite%2Fdp%2FB09MZBTMQQ\">Samsung Galaxy A03s</a> is your best bet. Thanks to its MediaTek Helio P35 processor, the A03s performs better than you would expect. Unfortunately, the phone feels about as cheap as it costs and the camera isn\u2019t much better. Oh, and did I mention the A03s ships with a measly 32GB of internal storage? In other words, be prepared to buy a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-microsd-card-130038282.html\">microSD card</a> to store all your photos and music. Thankfully, the A03s, like its more expensive sibling, will receive four years of security updates from Samsung. You won\u2019t find that kind of software support on any other handset in the sub-$200 category.</p><h2>Honorable mention: Motorola Moto G Stylus</h2><p></p><h2></h2><p>The $200 <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=673991f4-9b22-4608-a813-f4cbfa1518a1&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Motorola&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NzM5OTFmNC05YjIyLTQ2MDgtYTgxMy1mNGNiZmExNTE4YTEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubW90b3JvbGEuY29tL3VzL3NtYXJ0cGhvbmVzLW1vdG8tZy1zdHlsdXMtZ2VuLTQvcD9za3VJZD04OTUiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijc5M2EyYzczLTVhYzMtNDIwZi1iNjBiLTdkZWM4MTMyYmM5NCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAYnGfy11i0w3AL_bHIad0QB2itahHR5qT_jRjdm28ve3&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.motorola.com%2Fus%2Fsmartphones-moto-g-stylus-gen-4%2Fp%3FskuId%3D895\">Motorola Moto G Stylus</a> offers something none of the other picks on this list do: a built-in stylus. If you love doodling and jotting down notes, then this is the cheap phone to buy. Thankfully, it has a few other things going for it too. The Moto G Stylus sports a big and responsive 6.5-inch display and a long-lasting 5,000mAh battery. Plus, it\u2019s available in two lovely colors: midnight blue and glam pink.</p><p>As with other options in this price range, it would be nice if the Moto G Stylus came with a more capable camera, a fast charger and better protection against water. One word of advice: steer clear of Moto G Stylus 5G. It doesn\u2019t offer enough of an upgrade to justify costing $400.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-cheap-phones-130017793.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/best-cheap-phones-130017793.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-29 14:00:17+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Apple's Beats Studio Pro could include head-tracking spatial audio", "description": "<p>Apple's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apples-new-beats-studio-headphones-could-support-personalized-spatial-audio-200614057.html\">rumored Beats Studio Pro headphones</a> may be more compelling than AirPods for some listeners. <em>9to5Mac</em><a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2023/06/28/beats-studio-pro-features-battery-life-more/\">claims</a> to have leaked specs indicating the Studio Pro will be the first Beats earphones to support head-tracking spatial audio.

They'll reportedly last up to 24 hours with active noise cancellation enabled (40 without ANC) versus the 20 hours of the Max. You may also get both a 3.5mm jack and a USB-C port, and the 3.5mm cable could even be included in the box. On top of previously rumored personalized spatial audio, you'd get adaptive, environment-sensitive ANC and microphones that improve call quality versus the Studio 3 Wireless (pictured above).</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The design is said to be similar to the Studio 3, but with improved ear cushions that promise better comfort and durability. Metal sliders may also deliver a more adjustable fit.</p><p>While the Studio Pro won't use Apple's self-branded chips, it will supposedly use a custom Beats chip that bolsters support for both Apple devices and Android. Both platforms will apparently support easy pairing, seamless device switching and lost-item tracking. Apple hardware may also support hands-free &quot;hey Siri&quot; voice commands.</p><p>Leaker Myke Hurley <a href=\"https://redirect.viglink.com/?format=go&amp;jsonp=vglnk_168804476999110&amp;key=c1c7d488bb2df8a8b659d5d41634d304&amp;libId=ljh3w01z010023dg000ULyj01n6hq1155&amp;loc=https%3A%2F%2F9to5mac.com%2F2023%2F06%2F28%2Fbeats-studio-pro-features-battery-life-more%2F&amp;v=1&amp;out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.relay.fm%2Fconnected%2F455&amp;title=Exclusive%3A%20Beats%20Studio%20Pro%20battery%20life%20exceeds%20AirPods%20Max%2C%20Spatial%20Audio%20fully%20featured%2C%20much%20more%20-%209to5Mac&amp;txt=Relay%20FM%E2%80%99s%20Connected%20podcast\">claims</a> the Beats Studio Pro will arrive on July 19th, and <em>9to5</em> believes they'll match the $349 price of the Studio 3.

The freshly announced Zenfone 10 looks like a carbon copy of its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/asus-zenfone-9-pricing-availability-133059742.html\">predecessor</a>, and even its 50-megapixel main camera has remained unchanged. Still, the company claims that this is now powered by a new version of 6-axis gimbal stabilization \u2014 a combination of hardware optical stabilization, upgraded electronic stabilization algorithm and fast auto-focus. This apparently lets you capture smoother videos and less blurry photos while on the move.</p><p>As you'd expect, the Zenfone 10 is powered by Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor, and now with faster LPDDR5X ROM of up to 16GB, along with faster UFS 4.0 storage option of up to 512GB \u2014 doubling that of the previous gen.

It's the second time in the last week that the Board has <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/oversight-board-criticizes-meta-for-refusing-to-take-down-brazilian-pro-insurrection-video-124533251.html\">reversed</a> a high profile Meta review, after a Brazilian user posted a video asking followers to &quot;besiege&quot; government. However, it's the first time the Oversight Board has asked for a head of state to be banned, a decision that may have ramifications for future policy decisions.&nbsp;</p><p>Hun Sen, who has led Cambodia since 1985, is facing an election this month. Earlier in the year, he posted a video of a speech telling political opponents he'd &quot;gather CPP (Cambodia People's Party) people to protest and beat you up.&quot; Following several user reports and appeals, Meta policy and subject matter experts recommended leaving the post up based on newsworthiness, even though it violated the company's community standards for violence and incitement.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>&quot;Given the severity of the violation, Hun Sen\u2019s history of committing human rights violations and intimidating political opponents, as well as his strategic use of social media to amplify such threats, the Board calls on Meta to immediately suspend Hun Sen\u2019s Facebook page and Instagram account for six months,&quot; it wrote. The suspension is non-binding, but Meta must take down the contested video within 60 days.&nbsp;</p><p>In explaining the decision, the Board said that the &quot;harm caused by allowing the content on the platform outweighs the post's public interest value,&quot; particularly given the prime minister's reach on social media. The original moderation decision, it added, &quot;results in Meta's platforms contributing to these harms by amplifying the threats and resulting intimidation.&quot;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Such behavior should not be rewarded. Meta should more heavily weigh press freedom when considering newsworthiness so that the allowance is not applied to government speech in situations where that government has made its own content more newsworthy by limiting free press.</p></blockquote><p>On top of Hun Sen's ban, the Board advised Meta to make clear that its moderation policies are not restricted to single incidents of civil unrest or violence. It also recommended removing the newsworthiness allowance policy in cases involving incitement of violence, and prioritize reviews involving heads of state and senior members of government. Finally, it asked Meta to reveal the reasoning behind its decision for Hun Sen &quot;and in all account-level actions against heads of state and senior members of government.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>The Board's review could set a bar for moderation of other authoritarian leaders in Asia, Human Rights Watch director Phil Robertson told <em>The Post</em>, while calling the takedown request of Hun Sen &quot;long overdue.&quot; Facebook famously <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/facebook-locks-out-trump-24-hours-014550117.html\">banned</a> former US president Donald Trump from the platform (and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/donald-trump-will-get-facebook-and-instagram-accounts-back-221702241.html\">restored his account</a> earlier this year), but has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/06/19/facebook-meta-vietnam-government-censorship/\">caved</a> to censorship demands in nations including Vietnam.

The French passenger train, the Coradia iLint, is a short-term demonstration, running through the end of September, that aims to spark adoption in Canada and the US. The Coradia iLint uses roughly \u201cabout 50 kilograms of hydrogen a day,\u201d says Serge Harnois, CEO of Hanois \u00c9nergies, the train\u2019s hydrogen fuel supplier. The same journey using a standard engine would burn around 500 liters of diesel fuel. It only emits water vapor along its journey as a byproduct of combining hydrogen with oxygen. Sounds good, right? Well, there are caveats. It requires a diesel-powered truck to transport the hydrogen to the train every time it refuels, and let\u2019s not forget about the emissions made by the train\u2019s trip from Europe to Canada for a mere three-month demo.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/north-americas-first-hydrogen-powered-train-debuts-in-canada-173019365.html\"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/i-consider-myself-a-patient-person-but-the-password-game-might-break-me-174555782.html\">'The Password Game' might break you</a></h2><h3>A game where you have to jump through hoops to make a new password.</h3><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/i-consider-myself-a-patient-person-but-the-password-game-might-break-me-174555782.html\"><figure><img alt=\"TMA\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/aa9aefe0-1666-11ee-a7f6-71fc5cbc294b\" style=\"height: 405px; width: 675px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Alstom</div></figure></a><p>The goal of the game is to create a password no one hacker could possibly crack, and the experience starts out simple enough. \u201cYour password must be at least 5 characters,\u201d states rule one, while rule four asks that all the digits in your password add up to 25.

Now, Meta has given us pretty comprehensive look at <a href=\"https://ai.facebook.com/blog/ai-unconnected-content-recommendations-facebook-instagram/\">how its AI systems decide</a> on the posts that appear on our Facebook and Instagram feeds. The social networking giant has released <a href=\"https://transparency.fb.com/features/explaining-ranking\">22 card systems</a> for the platforms that explain how its AI systems rank content for its Feed, Stories and Reels. Each card explains how a certain aspect of Meta's platform works \u2014 for instance, the company explains that for Facebook Feeds, its AI system starts by gathering all potential posts by friends and Pages you follow.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, the system considers various input signals, such as who created the post, how you interacted with them and how many of your friends have liked the post, if any. All those aspects will help the AI rank posts based on which you'll find the most relevant and valuable and then show them on your feed in order of the scores they get. The card systems also show how you can customize what you see on the platforms and link to instructions on, say, how to unfollow a person or a group and how to click &quot;show more&quot; or &quot;show less&quot; on a post to indicate if you like or dislike a particular subject.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>In a <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2023/06/how-ai-ranks-content-on-facebook-and-instagram/\">post announcing</a> the cards' release, Nick Clegg, Meta's President of Global Affairs, listed the tools you can use to personalize your experience on the company's platforms. In addition to the two aforementioned tools, Facebook and Instagram have centralized menus with customization controls, called Feed Preferences and Suggested Content Control Center, respectively. Clegg also said that Meta is testing a new feature on Instagram allows you to indicate whether you're &quot;Interested&quot; in a recommended reel in the Reels tab, so the app can show you more similar content. At the moment, you can only indicate whether you're <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/instagram-183050699.html\">&quot;Not Interested&quot;</a> in a specific reel. In addition, he said Meta is working on making the &quot;show more&quot; and &quot;show less&quot; feature more prominent.&nbsp;</p><p>Meta has lifted the lid on how its algorithms work before the European Union starts enacting the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/eu-agreement-digital-services-act-172049636.html\">Digital Markets Act</a> in 2024. The new law will require online services like Facebook and Instagram to be more transparent on the technologies behind their recommendation algorithms.
