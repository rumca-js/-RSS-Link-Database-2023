He\u2019s an artist who changed his name and stopped making mainstream music entirely in 1979 as a result of his conversion to Islam, and didn\u2019t resume performing non-secular material until 2006. His profile in the intervening years was confined to the news, where he regularly appeared as a spokesperson on matters pertaining to the Muslim community. In the interim, his vast-selling 70s albums receded a little into history and now, bafflingly for anyone who remembers their respective profiles in the early 70s, the work of Nick Drake is probably better known and certainly more regularly referenced as an influence today than Yusuf\u2019s oeuvre.</p><p>But that simply means his legends slot is an opportunity for Yusuf to remind the audience of just how many remarkable songs he was responsible for \u2013 not only the singer-songwriter material that made him a global superstar as the decades turned, but the smart, occasionally slightly strange pop that was his stock in trade prior to that. I Love My Dog \u2013 which he performs as a medley with Here Comes My Baby \u2013 remains a deeply odd song, one that compares his affections for his inamorata unfavourably with those he feels for his faithful hound.

What they offer to get them could be a gamechanger</p><p>British politics for the next year should be conducted not from Westminster but from Scotland. Since the Scottish National party leadership <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/20/scottish-independence-activists-focus-on-grassroots-as-crisis-enfolds-snp\">imploded this month</a>, its once rock-solid support has collapsed. A <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/snp-labour-poll-next-general-election-nicola-sturgeon-07vxfqq9s\">recent poll</a> suggests that the SNP\u2019s cohort of MPs will plummet at a 2024 election from 45 to 21. The beneficiary could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/29/this-is-how-labour-can-win-back-scotland-and-achieve-a-majority-uk-government\">well be Labour</a>, surging from one MP to 26.</p><p>Sceptics have begun casting doubt on Keir Starmer\u2019s ostensibly safe 17-point <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/united-kingdom/\">poll lead</a> for Labour. They recall a similar \u201cunbeatable\u201d Labour lead in 1992, when the Tories went on to win. Starmer currently needs 124 new MPs for an overall majority. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/10/labour-lead-tories-battleground-seats-poll-conservatives-election\">Forecasts </a>offer him 117 switching from the Tories in England and Wales, while a similar swing in Scotland would offer perhaps six to eight seats to Labour. This is barely enough, and the odds are on a hung parliament. Labour needs those 26 seats in Scotland, and desperately so.</p><p>Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In what felt like slow motion, Imafidon stood, frozen to the floor of his temporary Islington flat, as a team of plain-clothed police officers pushed their way past him. One read out his rights, while the others threw his belongings into evidence bags: the laptop that barely half an hour earlier he had been writing a college essay on; clothes, seemingly at random; his mobile phone. Few people even knew where he was staying, having recently relocated north of the Thames to get away from the escalating street violence that had been playing out closer to home. Just minutes earlier, he\u2019d been talking on the phone to a friend back in Peckham, making plans for his upcoming 18th birthday celebrations. Now, he was in handcuffs, being led outside and into a waiting unmarked police vehicle, unsure if or when he\u2019d return. He was terrified and he was panicking. Mostly, though, he was baffled. It simply made no sense.</p><p>More than 12 years later, Imafidon still struggles to find the right words to describe these emotions. What it felt like, during a police interview, to realise the murder in question was that of Sylvester Akapalara: a 17-year-old boy in the year below Imafidon at college, who was gunned down on Peckham\u2019s Pelican Estate. Imafidon had considered Akapalara a friend.

But there are certain reds that also fit the definition, wines that respond just as well to being served with a bit of a chill, and which have their own way of slaking the thirst and matching an alfresco meal. For me, this time of the year always comes with a craving for the wines of the two French regions that have mastered the art of the summer red, Beaujolais and the Loire. While a crisp white will bring the mouthwatering qualities of citrus, these are wines that, in their different ways, bring the refreshment of the just-ripe berry or currant: wines, such as Asda\u2019s Fleurie, that are light in body, high in acidity, and with a sappy quality to their juicy burst of red fruit.</p><p><strong>Domaine du Pr\u00e9 Baron Touraine Gamay, Touraine, Loire, France 2021 (from \u00a39.79, <a href=\"https://www.allaboutwine.co.uk/\">allaboutwine.co.uk</a>; <a href=\"https://talkingwines.co.uk/\">talkingwines.co.uk</a>; <a href=\"https://www.rannochscott.co.uk/\">rannochscott.co.uk</a>)</strong> Other mouthwatering Beaujolais bottles that I have loved recently and that would make a perfect match with salad and a steak, a plate of charcuterie or a meze selection (Beaujolais is a brilliantly versatile food wine) include the easeful supple feel and raspberry juiciness of <a href=\"https://www.marksandspencer.com/\">M&amp;S</a> Classic Beaujolais Villages 2022 (\u00a310), the silky, deep immersion in berry land of Thibault Ducroux En Roue Libre Beaujolais 2021 (\u00a318.95, <a href=\"https://thesourcingtable.com/pages/shop\">thesourcingtable.com</a>), and the vividly fruit-filled flow of Domaine Chapel Beaujolais Villages 2021 (\u00a321.95, <a href=\"https://nattyboywines.co.uk/\">nattyboywines.co.uk</a>). All red Beaujolais (the region does make a little, often rather good, white wine, too) is made from the gamay variety, which is also one of the red grapes used to make summer wines in the Loire, with the summer-pudding compote exuberance of Domaine du Pr\u00e9 Baron\u2019s example from Touraine offering an intriguing point of comparison with Beaujolais.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/25/cool-reds-to-enjoy-when-its-hot-beaujolais-and-the-loire\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/25/cool-reds-to-enjoy-when-its-hot-beaujolais-and-the-loire", "date_published": "2023-06-25 05:01:27+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Los Moros, York: \u2018A lot going on in a very small space\u2019 \u2013 restaurant review", "description": "North Africa and Yorkshire come together at this restaurant - and get along famously well<p><strong>Los Moros, 15-17 Grape Lane, York YO1 7HU (01904 636834; <a href=\"https://www.losmorosyork.co.uk/\">losmorosyork.co.uk</a>).

Less weird-looking now than in the years when he sported braids and a goatee beard, he still pulls off the selection of onstage moves identified by the American writer John Jeremiah Sullivan in his superb 2006 essay The Final Comeback of Axl Rose: stalking, cartoonish pugnaciousness; snaky slide-foot dance; dammit just dropped a bowling ball on my foot spin-with-mic-stand dance; prance sideways with mic stand like an attacking staff-wielding ritual warrior between-verses dance.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/25/guns-n-roses-at-glastonbury-review-pyramid-stage\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/25/guns-n-roses-at-glastonbury-review-pyramid-stage", "date_published": "2023-06-25 00:40:22+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Scooter, a Chinese crested, is crowned world\u2019s ugliest dog", "description": "<p>The annual contest celebrates pets\u2019 imperfections, such as Scooter\u2019s backwards-facing hind legs and sparse hair</p><p>Linda Elmquist, of Tucson, Arizona, smiled broadly as she held her little dog aloft.
