<p><strong>Pyramid stage</strong><br />She can’t sing like she used to – but makes up for it with a riveting performance full of untamed theatrics and awesomely aloof cool</p><p>The chief grumble about Pyramid stage sets is about artists who aren’t perceived to have enough hits to play it (Stormzy and Billie Eilish have been the chief recent targets of this opprobrium, each with an undercurrent of prejudice). Of all the bands to play this weekend, the one least burdened by this problem has to be Blondie.</p><p>It’s easy to forget just how broad and deep their discography goes, until you’re socked again and again with hit after hit; even with 75 minutes to play with there’s no room for Union City Blue, Picture This, Sunday Girl and so many more.

<p>The Wagner group chief’s rebellion swiftly came to a halt, but the consequences will reverberate in Russia and beyond</p><p>Yevgeny Prigozhin <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/25/wagner-boss-to-leave-russia-as-reports-say-us-spy-agencies-picked-up-signs-of-planned-uprising-days-ago" title="">called off his march</a> on Moscow on Saturday every bit as abruptly as he had begun his rebellion the previous day. But the Wagner group’s armed mutiny, however short-lived, has diminished Vladimir Putin in the eyes of both the elite and ordinary Russians. The mercenaries had taken over the Russian southern military command in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/24/rostov-on-don-why-russian-city-targeted-wagner-group" title="">Rostov-on-Don</a>, a logistical hub for the Ukraine invasion, before racing towards the capital. Mr Putin was forced to warn of “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/24/vladimir-putin-russia-wagner-statement-full" title="">a deadly threat to our state</a>” and Moscow’s mayor urged residents to stay at home.</p><p>While Mr Prigozhin’s uprising looks like a desperate act to stop his private army <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/14/vladimir-putin-sides-with-military-chiefs-placing-wagner-under-direct-control" title="">being incorporated into regular forces</a>, some wonder if broader intra-elite conflict lies in the background. The Wagner chief had become <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/politika/89008" title="">increasingly brazen</a> in his attacks on the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, and commander in chief, Valery Gerasimov. Initially there were suggestions that he might be acting with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/09/russian-armed-forces-infighting-yevgeny-prigozhin" title="">approval of the Kremlin</a>. But on Friday, Mr Prigozhin attacked not only the execution of the war but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/23/wagner-chief-accuses-moscow-of-lying-to-public-about-ukraine-yevgeny-prigozhin" title="">its very rationale</a>, before <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/23/wagner-chief-accuses-russias-military-of-attack-and-says-evil-leadership-must-be-stopped" title="">claiming</a> that Russian forces had killed scores of his men in a rocket attack and demanding revenge on the “evil” military leadership.

## Yusuf/Cat Stevens at Glastonbury review – singer-songwriter’s ‘legends’ set is a lowkey triumph

<p>The 74-year-old’s sweet, mellow pop and indelibly beautiful classic cuts provided a soothing balm for tired music fans on the final afternoon of the festival  </p><p>On the surface, Yusuf/Cat Stevens might seem an unlikely booking for the Sunday ‘legends’ slot. He’s an artist who changed his name and stopped making mainstream music entirely in 1979 as a result of his conversion to Islam, and didn’t resume performing non-secular material until 2006. His profile in the intervening years was confined to the news, where he regularly appeared as a spokesperson on matters pertaining to the Muslim community. In the interim, his vast-selling 70s albums receded a little into history and now, bafflingly for anyone who remembers their respective profiles in the early 70s, the work of Nick Drake is probably better known and certainly more regularly referenced as an influence today than Yusuf’s oeuvre.</p><p>But that simply means his legends slot is an opportunity for Yusuf to remind the audience of just how many remarkable songs he was responsible for – not only the singer-songwriter material that made him a global superstar as the decades turned, but the smart, occasionally slightly strange pop that was his stock in trade prior to that. I Love My Dog – which he performs as a medley with Here Comes My Baby – remains a deeply odd song, one that compares his affections for his inamorata unfavourably with those he feels for his faithful hound. He seems slightly taken aback by the reaction – “Wow, thank you! Incredible. Woah!” – but perhaps he shouldn’t be. It’s followed by The First Cut Is the Deepest, which is as indelible and beautiful a song as anyone wrote in the 60s. And as if to prove the point, he subsequently covers the Beatles’ Here Comes the Sun: The First Cut Is the Deepest sounds just as good.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/25/yusuf-cat-stevens-at-glastonbury-review-legend">Continue reading...</a>

<p>(Guin)<br />The producer of viral hit Stunnin’ takes on house and emo in an uneven but bracing set</p><p>Bedroom pop producer Curtis Waters went viral with hilarious 2020 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgduhk26sIw">debut single Stunnin’,</a> which gently and catchily mocked the mindless swag of mainstream rap culture. Turbo-charged by lockdown, it became one of the first huge TikTok hits. A bipolar Nepali living in America, Waters hoped to use stardom to raise awareness around mental health issues. Sadly, the music industry’s inability to understand his complex, shifting outsider identity meant he was unable to leverage his instant success as planned. So he resolved to follow his muse and damn the consequences.</p><p>Waters’s debut, <em>Pity Party</em>, was mostly rap-adjacent alt-pop, each track fanfared with the cutely self-exhorting tag “good job, Curtis!” Now he has a go at emo, post-punk and house as well, which makes for an uneven but rarely boring listen. The first half is more derivative, Star Killer and Manic Man riffing on innovators such as Gary Numan and Kurt Cobain, while Himbo limply revisits the soft-voiced satire of Stunnin’. But <em>Bad Son</em> comes good by the end, with songs such as the bracingly weird Riot, American Dream’s intense, beat-free yowl and the yearning, desperate brilliance of Death Keeps Calling My Name.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/25/curtis-waters-bad-son-review-genre-busting-second-album-from-pop-outsider">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I could spend hours watching strangers wrangle slabs of beef under a hot sun. Just don’t ask me to tuck into the results</p><p>Are barbecues problematic? There’s the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/2010/07/01/grilling-men-women-barbecue-forbes-woman-time-cooking.html?sh=ffd8c97bad6c">drearily entrenched manliness</a>, the carcinogens released by charring, the campylobacter and salmonella from raw meat juices hitting your halloumi salad, sure. Then, worse, the scourge of disposables, that absolute tinfoil catastrophe. A million a year went to landfill <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/12/asda-and-morrisons-join-disposable-barbecue-ban-as-fire-risk-grows">before supermarkets stopped selling them last summer</a>. “Going to landfill” suggests people were patiently waiting for them to cool down then disposing of them carefully, when of course they were mostly left to injure meat-crazed seagulls, or catch fire and cause devastation. They’ve been responsible for destroying homes, damage to a Dorset nature reserve and Saddleworth Moor, among many other blazes. Some retailers have backslid this year, with the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/22633637/full-list-selling-banning-disposable-barbecues/">British Retail Consortium suggesting users grill “responsibly”</a>, which, yes, is definitely going to happen when you’re five tinned negronis down with moderate sunstroke.</p><p>So in that sense, of course barbecues are problematic. But as grilling season sizzles acridly across the backyards of Britain, are they problematic for <em>me</em>, a woman who doesn’t eat meat, whose fake hair retains smoke far more lastingly than real hair, married to a man who managed to snaffle one of those prized Aldi egg barbecues a few years back? Yes and no.</p><p>Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/25/i-dont-eat-meat-and-my-wig-always-ends-up-reeking-of-smoke-so-why-am-i-fascinated-by-barbecues">Continue reading...</a>

## Nobel prize winner Giorgio Parisi: ‘There’s a lack of trust in science – we need to show how it’s done’

<p>The Italian physicist puts the fiendishly tricky theory of complex systems in terms of birds and bus rides, as his new book aims to make his branch of science accessible to all</p><p>The multi-prize-winning theoretical physicist Giorgio Parisi was born in Rome in 1948. He studied physics at the Sapienza University in the city, and is now a professor of quantum theories there. A researcher of broad interests, Parisi is perhaps best known for his work on “spin glasses” or disordered magnetic states, contributing to the theory of complex systems. For this work, together with Klaus Hasselmann and Syukuro Manabe, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/oct/05/nobel-prize-physics-scientists-sykuro-manabe-klaus-hasselmann-giorgio-parisi-win-climate">he won the Nobel prize</a> in physics in 2021. His first popular science book, <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/in-a-flight-of-starlings-9780241587485">In </a></em><em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/in-a-flight-of-starlings-9780241587485">a Flight of Starlings: The Wonder</a></em><em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/in-a-flight-of-starlings-9780241587485"> of Complex Systems</a></em>, which charts some of the highlights of his life’s work and makes a passionate case for the value of science, is published on 11 July.</p><p><strong>How did you get interested in physics?<br /></strong>As a young child, I was interested in numbers – my mother told me I learned to read numbers aged three. On the street we’d be waiting for a tram and I’d say, here comes the number six. When it was time to go to university, I pondered if I should do physics or maths, but in the end I went for physics. Maybe because there were more popular books on physics than mathematics, which is so abstract that it’s difficult to describe.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jun/25/giorgio-parisi-nobel-prize-physics-spin-glasses-complex-systems-in-a-flight-of-starlings">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘The Spice Girls would go down a storm here’: Melanie C in conversation at Glastonbury festival

<p>The Spice Girls star discusses mental health, the band’s LGBTQ+ legacy and her dream of playing the legends slot at Worthy Farm in the latest of the Guardian’s onstage talks with musicians at Glastonbury</p><p>It was such a huge disappointment earlier this year when persistent rumours that the Spice Girls were playing Glastonbury were quashed. Melanie C was as disappointed as any of us, as she told the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jan/16/hot-mama-catsuit-spice-girl-mel-c-sporty-modern-dance-ginger">Guardian in January</a>. But she still made it to the festival to play a banging set on Saturday, her deep catalogue of solo disco-worthy songs capped off with a couple of Spice Girls hits. Interviewed by the Guardian’s Laura Snapes on Sunday morning in the Cabaret tent at the festival, she seems totally thrilled by the experience, chatting away with characteristic ebullience. “I didn’t expect the amount of people that came!” she says. Why on earth not? Any Spice Girl would draw a Glasto crowd, but Melanie Chisholm has more musical material to draw from than any of the rest of them.</p><p>It seems ridiculous that the Spice Girls have never played this festival – but as Mel points out, things were different in the 90s. “Back in the day you wouldn’t have seen a band like the Spice Girls at a festival,” she says. “But things have changed over the years.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/25/the-spice-girls-melanie-c-glastonbury-festival">Continue reading...</a>

## Scouts! The Musical review – family show wins gold badges for enthusiasm

<p><strong>The Other Palace, London</strong> <br />Be prepared to be won over to the pleasures of scouting by Gigglemug’s winning mix of knots, knockabout games and infectious songs</p><p>You could look at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/15/scouts-march-back-into-britains-inner-cities-as-membership-soars">the Scout movement</a> for a long time before thinking: this calls for a musical! But that’s what Gigglemug Theatre has come up with: a 90-minute show for families developed in cahoots with the Scout Association. And it’s great fun. Perhaps in the Other Palace studio, it can feel more like a workshop for a musical than a fully realised show. But what it lacks in space, set and – at times – script development, it handsomely makes up in spirit and enthusiasm. Its endearing six-strong cast of actor-musicians hurl themselves at the material; the show is never off its front foot.</p><p>The story revolves around the annual Scout Games, where plucky youngsters – and a handful of press-ganged audience members – compete for the prestigious gold badge. There’s a riddles round, a portraiture round and more, as protagonists Joe and Ayesha close in on the final. Jeopardy is supplied by a renegade ex-scout come to avenge herself for her failure to win the games, way back when. Courtesy of the Trance Dance – a number owing more than a little to Rocky Horror’s Time Warp – she enlists some hypnotised helpers in a bid to turn this do-gooding movement into a force for bad.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/25/scouts-the-musical-review-gigglemug-the-other-palace-london">Continue reading...</a>

<p>All-female  competition folded after three seasons, but it changed perceptions and prompted F1 into action</p><p>The all-female W Series had grand plans to change the landscape of motor racing, all bold and ambitious, but just over a week ago, when it was placed into administration, the championship was all but over. Out of money and out of time it <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/oct/10/w-series-declare-chadwick-as-champion-after-season-folds-due-to-lack-of-finances" title="">foundered to a halt</a>, an ignominious end to worthy aspirations. Yet across the three short seasons it ran the W Series left its mark on racing. It may be gone but it undoubtedly made a difference.</p><p>In 2019, at the Brands Hatch finale of the inaugural season, it was impossible not to notice the impact of the nascent championship. The paddock thronged with families and crucially hundreds of young girls, drawn to watch and meet the role models that had previously been so few and far between in racing. It was a moment of particular vindication and pleasure for the series’ chief executive, Catherine Bond Muir, who had put three years into building a project that was close to her heart.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jun/25/trailblazing-w-series-has-created-opportunities-for-women-in-motor-sport">Continue reading...</a>

Most people are honest, but when I was lied to it left me questioning all my own opinions<p>When were you last lied to? To your knowledge, obviously. Was the lie something that mattered? Was the liar convincing? Did they confess, or did you find them out? And how did you react? Maybe with anger. Maybe with hurt bemusement. Or contempt – like my grandmother, who had a stock retort for anyone who tried to pull the wool over her eyes: “I hate liars. They’re worse than thieves.”</p><p>Did you feel, afterwards, that you’d been easy to fool? If so, you’d be in good company. It’s the norm to assume communication is honest – and that’s something to be thankful for, because we’d live in a miserable, suspicious world otherwise. Less helpfully, it’s common to assume that body language gives away dishonesty when it does arise. Liars look shifty, in the popular imagination. They cough before they speak, fidget and don’t look you in the eye. Unfortunately, none of these cues are very reliable.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/25/is-it-possible-to-spot-a-good-liar-and-why-do-we-all-do-it">Continue reading...</a>

First female general secretary of the Labour party who played a key role in the 1997 landslide election victory<p>The former Labour Party general secretary Margaret McDonagh, who has died aged 61 from brain cancer, was a formidable political strategist responsible for the tactics that won her party the landslide general election in 1997, sweeping Tony Blair and “New Labour” into office for a generation. A key figure in the modernisation of the party’s aims and values, four years later she helped to deliver a record second landslide victory.</p><p>She was a fierce, dedicated, single-minded woman whose political views had been formed by the impact of the devastating Labour party feuding of the late 1970s and early 80s, and the electoral rout it suffered in the 1983 general election. She was a rightwing pragmatist whose own background had taught her that winning support from working-class and lower middle-class voters meant that Labour had to identify with their concerns, specifically on issues such as crime and security.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/25/lady-mcdonagh-margaret-mcdonagh-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

Some of people’s grievances are only too familiar: low pay, insecurity, a sense of being hopelessly cut off from power and influence. Others – inflation, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/22/bank-of-england-raises-interest-rates-by-a-half-point-to-5">impossible </a>mortgage payments, rents, and the overlooked effects of the pandemic – have arrived comparatively recently.</p><p>What also seems new is the sheer reach of these problems, into parts of the population we might have previously considered to be relatively affluent.

<p>The towering and divisive figure who transformed architecture published his manifesto for modernism in 1923. Here architects including Frank Gehry and Jacques Herzog explore his legacy</p><p>V<em>ers Une Architecture</em> – <em>Towards an Architecture</em> – is the most influential book on the design of buildings since Vitruvius wrote his <em>De Architectura </em>in the reign of the Roman emperor Augustus. It is a manifesto for modernism, arguing that the beauty and logic of machines and engineering – of viaducts, ocean liners and grain silos – be applied to the design of buildings. It also promotes its author, the Swiss-born French architect and painter Le Corbusier, as a man uniquely able to bring this new world into being.</p><p>Le Corbusier was to architecture what Picasso was to painting, a towering and egomaniacal creative force who transformed his discipline for ever. His buildings have inspired admiration, sometimes devotion. He is an icon, granted the nickname “Corb” or “Corbu” by architects. He has also been vigorously attacked, as a mechanistic fanatic whose ideas inspired inhumane tower blocks and concrete jungles.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/25/100-years-of-le-corbusier-what-does-he-mean-to-todays-architects">Continue reading...</a>

He is not, in this version, the hero. The myth of Sherwood’s folkloric outlaw really has, as the title says, been rewritten, with rip-roaring results.</p><p>Carl Grose’s story of “Hood” and his outlawed accomplices is updated with a climate message and plenty of questions around land ownership, all shot through with Pythonesque humour and the occasional sounds of steel drums.

<p>Labour and the Tories are desperate for Scottish seats.

Since the Scottish National party leadership <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/20/scottish-independence-activists-focus-on-grassroots-as-crisis-enfolds-snp">imploded this month</a>, its once rock-solid support has collapsed. A <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/snp-labour-poll-next-general-election-nicola-sturgeon-07vxfqq9s">recent poll</a> suggests that the SNP’s cohort of MPs will plummet at a 2024 election from 45 to 21. The beneficiary could <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/29/this-is-how-labour-can-win-back-scotland-and-achieve-a-majority-uk-government">well be Labour</a>, surging from one MP to 26.</p><p>Sceptics have begun casting doubt on Keir Starmer’s ostensibly safe 17-point <a href="https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/united-kingdom/">poll lead</a> for Labour. They recall a similar “unbeatable” Labour lead in 1992, when the Tories went on to win. Starmer currently needs 124 new MPs for an overall majority. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/10/labour-lead-tories-battleground-seats-poll-conservatives-election">Forecasts </a>offer him 117 switching from the Tories in England and Wales, while a similar swing in Scotland would offer perhaps six to eight seats to Labour.

<p>Those who knew and loved former Wasps and Canada rugby player have had to find their own answers about his death</p><p>Stormin’ Norman Hadley was a bear of a man. “‘Big?’” says his best friend Eddie Evans. “‘Big’ is too small a word.” Hadley was 6ft 7in, weighed around 280lb and could bench-press more again. He won 15 caps for Canada as a lock forward in the late 80s and early 90s and it ought to have been more, played four Tests for the Barbarians and spent the best years of his career at Wasps, where he was, his teammate Lawrence Dallaglio remembers, “the hardest man I’ve ever had to lift in my life”. Dallaglio reckons Hadley “must have been one of the biggest guys ever to play the game”.</p><p>And one of the brightest. “He was scary intelligent,” says Evans. Hadley had an honours degree in economics, and a top-of-the-class MBA that he parlayed into a multimillion-dollar career in banking. Evans always enjoyed it when strangers made the mistake of underestimating Norman. “They’d look at him and think he was a typical jock, like he was some kind of big dummy, and he’d come out with one of his lines.” He drops his voice an octave. “Like: ‘Don’t get into a battle of wits with me, sunshine, because you’re woefully unarmed.’”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/25/every-single-blow-was-one-more-nail-in-his-coffin-the-life-and-death-of-stormin-norman-hadley">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Bright, fun and tasty, there is now a ‘gummy’ for everything. But do these ‘candyceuticals’ offer any real benefits? Laura Potter looks into the booming chewables market to find out what we are actually being asked to swallow</p><p>Squishy, fruity, sweet-tasting, chewable treats in adorable shapes, such as teddy bears, stars and berries. They’re not in plastic packets, but colourful tubs or beautifully designed subscription boxes. We’re not talking about children’s sweeties, but gummy supplements. We’re told these little morsels can give us thicker hair, healthier skin and stronger nails, they can improve our sleep and mood, and ease our digestion. Taken daily, they’ll even help us cope with the demands of modern life. And they are very big business.</p><p>The UK vitamins and supplements market is currently worth £520m, with nearly one in four Brits popping vitamins, minerals or supplements daily and, increasingly, we are chewing rather than swallowing our way to healthier versions of ourselves. Gummies are the star of the industry. The global market in cute, chewable gummy vitamins is worth an estimated $7.3bn, displacing pills which, according to the <em>Nutrition Business Journal</em>, officially slipped behind non-pill format supplements in 2019. The appeal of gummies ties into a high demand for personalised supplements, according to market research agency Mintel, and “beauty from within”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/25/lets-chew-it-over-a-look-at-gummy-supplements">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The charismatic star can’t quite save this bland tale of a woman employed to teach a young man about the ways of the world</p><p>Maddie (Jennifer Lawrence) has already had her car repossessed (it didn’t help that an aggrieved ex-boyfriend worked for the debt collection agency). And now she’s on the brink of losing her beloved home, a chocolate-box cottage on the Montauk coast that she inherited from her late mother. Then she spots a Craigslist advert – a wealthy couple seek a young woman to take their socially maladroit 19-year-old son in hand (as it were), teaching him the ways of the world before he heads to Princeton. It’s the kind of premise that seems more in tune with a certain kind of crass, oversexed 80s teen comedy than with contemporary cinematic mores. But the generational disconnect and the toe-curling awkwardness of 32-year-old Maddie’s seduction assault on poor, terrified Percy (Andrew Barth Feldman, all elbows and uncertainty) are rather the point of this sporadically amusing but instantly forgettable romp. The unstoppable force of Lawrence’s charisma notwithstanding, this is not so much tasteless, just a bit bland.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/25/no-hard-feelings-review-sporadically-amusing-romp-jennifer-lawrence">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This perky tribute to the 80s pop sensations reveals the bond between the pair and the cost to George Michael of playing the heart-throb</p><p>Big hair, tiny shorts and some of the catchiest songs of the 80s: Wham! were, deservedly, a pop phenomenon. But, as this suitably perky archive documentary account of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/09/george-michaels-30-greatest-songs-ranked">George Michael</a> and Andrew Ridgeley’s stellar trajectory reveals, much of the music press at the time dismissed them as himbo dimwits: plenty of Studio Line hairspray and burnished mahogany tans, but little in the way of substance. It hurt – archive interview audio from Michael hints that the sting from this lack of early acknowledgment persisted throughout his career. But the beauty of Wham!, a key part of the appeal of the band, came from the perception that they were a self-contained unit, a guaranteed good time seemingly impervious to negativity. And for a while, that was true: the film, which creates a dialogue between recent interviews with Ridgeley and older archive recordings of Michael, pays tribute to the close bond between the two Bushey Meads school friends who found themselves living the dream. But it also explores the cost to the then closeted Michael of the teen heart-throb persona he was forced to wear along with his canary-yellow Fila tennis shorts.</p><p>In cinemas 28 June, Netflix 5 July</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/25/wham-review-the-truth-behind-the-mahogany-tans-and-catchy-songs">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From Bosch to Dante to Sartre, and from Hell’s Angels to Hell’s Kitchen to Hellraiser, visions of the infernal location and condition still resonate</p><p>Biomedical neuroengineers have recently noticed that when visitors to the Prado in Madrid pause in front of Bosch’s triptych <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2017/jan/10/bosch-garden-of-earthly-delights-shows-a-world-waking-up-to-the-future" title="">The Garden of Earthly Delights</a></em> they make short work of paradise and instead opt for perdition. The panel on the left depicts a blithe, bucolic Eden, where the average museum-goer spends only 16 seconds. The central section, which shows a polymorphous orgy that is about as shocking as a weekend of suburban wife-swapping in the 1960s, detains viewers for 26 seconds. But when reaching the far end, they spend 33 seconds exploring a perverse inferno in which people copulate with birds, a pig dons a nun’s wimple, and a set of bagpipes mimics a wilting penis and a bloated sac of testicles.</p><p>Instinctively, almost automatically, the average pair of eyes swipes right. Hell is irresistible, despite Bosch’s man-eating rabbits and defecating demons; certainly it is too attractive a place to be the exclusive preserve of religious fanatics, who designed it as a pit into which they could fling all those of whom they disapproved. We grow up when we outgrow such notions – and when we stop believing in hell, we probably acknowledge that in our dreams and fantasies we spend many agreeable hours there, especially after dark.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jun/25/hell-on-earth-how-a-place-of-torture-has-haunted-us-culturally-over-time">Continue reading...</a>

With its recycled vaulted steel roof, and reuse of old wooden packing cases, this stunning Mexican home offers lessons in sustainable chic<p>Deep in the Mexican countryside of Valle de Bravo – a lush escape about two hours’ drive from Mexico City – Emiliano Garcia and Helene Carlo found the perfect spot to build an eco home. Partners in life and in <a href="https://aspj.mx/" title="">ASPJ</a>, a Mexican architecture and landscape design studio, the couple had a burning question: can we build more sustainably and cheaper, and in a way that can be widely copied?</p><p>“It was important for us to prove its feasibility and to be able to make our structure replicable, not only a one-of-a-kind,” says Garcia.

## The week in theatre: Dear England; The Pillowman; The Third Man – review

<p><strong>Olivier theatre; Duke of York’s theatre; Menier Chocolate Factory, London<br /></strong>Joseph Fiennes scores as Gareth Southgate in a rousing football drama; Lily Allen glimmers in a low-voltage Martin McDonagh revival; and a musical Third Man hits a bum note</p><p>It is not common. This feeling of confident excitement as you wait for the curtain to go up. It is about as rare as being certain that England are going to win a big match. Ah, but <strong><a href="https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/productions/dear-england/">Dear England</a></strong> is by James Graham, who over the last decade has altered what we expect from the theatre – not least on the stage of the National – and the expectation is justified. Once again the playwright shows his particular gift, for writing a popular play with a resonant social theme. He is mightily helped by director Rupert Goold – who moves from production to production like a theatrical oxygen cylinder – and by a tremendous performance, one of the best of the year so far, from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jun/11/hes-built-a-new-england-joseph-fiennes-on-tackling-the-role-of-footballs-gareth-southgate">Joseph Fiennes</a>.

Graham vividly sketches the particular mess in which the team found themselves before Southgate tiptoed in to take over: though seldom winning, they still considered themselves a top talent; any loss was an insupportable shock. Graham does not need to batter home the point that this could be considered the equivalent of the sense of inherited privilege that has helped to make the country flounder.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/25/the-week-in-theatre-dear-england-the-pillowman-the-third-man-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Kenny Imafidon was arrested under the controversial ‘joint enterprise’ law. After six months behind bars, his case was thrown out. Now 30, he has written a breathtaking memoir about his early years, acquittal – and what can be done to change the system</p><p>“Kenny Imafidon. We’re arresting you for the murder of…” After that, sound faded. To the teenage boy these words were directed at, everything that followed was incomprehensible white noise. In what felt like slow motion, Imafidon stood, frozen to the floor of his temporary Islington flat, as a team of plain-clothed police officers pushed their way past him. One read out his rights, while the others threw his belongings into evidence bags: the laptop that barely half an hour earlier he had been writing a college essay on; clothes, seemingly at random; his mobile phone. Few people even knew where he was staying, having recently relocated north of the Thames to get away from the escalating street violence that had been playing out closer to home. Just minutes earlier, he’d been talking on the phone to a friend back in Peckham, making plans for his upcoming 18th birthday celebrations. Now, he was in handcuffs, being led outside and into a waiting unmarked police vehicle, unsure if or when he’d return. He was terrified and he was panicking. Mostly, though, he was baffled. It simply made no sense.</p><p>More than 12 years later, Imafidon still struggles to find the right words to describe these emotions. What it felt like, during a police interview, to realise the murder in question was that of Sylvester Akapalara: a 17-year-old boy in the year below Imafidon at college, who was gunned down on Peckham’s Pelican Estate. Imafidon had considered Akapalara a friend. Still, on a quiet midweek lunchtime at the Prince of Peckham – a trendy pub just a few minutes’ walk from the scene of that tragedy – I ask him to try. “It was total shock,” he says, softly spoken but self-assured. “I was thinking about my whole life; questioning if I’d even have a future. What would other people think? I had no idea what was going to happen to me. I had no idea what I was accused of, but I knew that my whole world was suddenly at stake.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/25/my-world-was-at-stake-kenny-imafidon-on-the-injustice-that-shaped-his-life">Continue reading...</a>

In the BBC, in academia, in the arts and the civil service, in the minds of middle-class parents and on the opposition benches. It’s nebulous, shifting and insidious. For some years, this government has been at war with an invisible enemy, responsible for almost everything that is wrong with this country. Snobbery.</p><p>Take snobbery about vocational courses, a particularly stubborn political opponent. Education secretaries have been fighting it for decades. “I’m determined to tackle the minority of schools that perpetuate an outdated snobbery towards apprenticeships,” <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-law-will-end-outdated-snobbery-towards-apprenticeships" title="">said Nicky Morgan</a> in 2016. Her successor Damian Hinds was equally determined to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/damian-hinds-technical-education-speech#:~:text=In%20order%20for%20technical%20education,%2Dpaid%2C%20rewarding%20skilled%20job." title="">thwart “opinion formers”</a> who felt “vocational courses are for other people’s children”. Gavin Williamson, for his part, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9876223/How-apprenticeships-leave-young-people-52-732-better-three-years.html" title="">battled an “inbuilt snobbishness”</a> from families who think their children should go to university as a “rite of passage”.

## Britain’s shorter children reveal a grim story about austerity, but its scars run far deeper | Michael Marmot

Since 2010, our five-year-olds have been showing signs of reduced growth, a likely symptom of policies that have led to impoverished lives<p>‘I look down on him,” says the John Cleese figure, “because I am upper class.” The three of them – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIHrX-Jp2E" title="">Cleese, Ronnie Barker and Ronnie Corbett</a> – are lined in descending height order. “I look up to him,” says Barker, “because I am middle class; but I look down on him, because he is lower class,” looking at Corbett, who says: “I know my place.”</p><p>This timeless morsel captures what the data shows: height is highly <a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/status-syndrome-9781408834190/" title="">correlated with socioeconomic position</a>. In the Whitehall study, a long-term investigation of the health of British civil servants, it was found the higher people are, the higher they go. People at each rung on the employment ladder are taller, on average, than those below them, and shorter than those of higher status. It’s possible that being taller gets you promoted. More likely, the social circumstances of early childhood, including good nutrition, are linked not only to height, but to educational and social success. Height, then, is both an outcome of conditions in childhood and an indicator – by which I mean that shorter height is a likely reflection of adverse conditions that will affect other aspects of children’s development: cognitive, linguistic, emotional.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/25/britains-shorter-children-reveal-a-grim-story-about-austerity-but-its-scars-run-far-deeper">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With my son’s first sports day in full flow, we soon find he isn’t the only one in the spotlight</p><p>It’s my son’s first sports day and it’s been, mostly, wonderful. One drawback is that it’s been hatefully hot and we find ourselves entirely without shade in an open sports field. No one seems as bothered by the heat as me. Sure, the other parents do join me in bemoaning the bracing, spotlight heat screaming at us like a comically powerful sci-fi death ray. But their complaints are just that – complaints: delivered with all the irritation of a lost hat or a missed bin collection.</p><p>I, on the other hand, am very near death and trying to be stoical about it all, with very little success. Perhaps sensing my pinched smile, my faxpaper-pale skin, or the fact I keep saying, ‘It’s too hot, I will probably die,’ they offer me consolation, water and sun cream, and I do my best to focus on the events at hand.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/25/its-sports-day-and-there-can-be-more-than-one-winner">Continue reading...</a>

## Big Freedia: Central City review – a mighty endorphin rush

<p>(Queen Diva Music)<br />After a feature on Beyoncé’s Break My Soul, the best-known name in bounce is back with an album of bass-laden beasts, star guests and surprisingly musical moments</p><p>C<em>entral City</em> is Big Freedia’s first full-length LP in nine years. Clearly, the best-known name in New Orleans bounce – a stripped-back, party-forward variant of hip-hop – has not been idle, releasing a fistful of EPs, starring in <a href="https://www.billboard.com/culture/pride/big-freedia-new-fuse-tv-series-1235161992/">multiple TV series</a> and being extensively featured, most recently by Beyoncé, who showcased Freedia on <a href="https://youtu.be/WDZJPJV__bQ">Formation</a> (2016) and on last year’s ubiquitous <a href="https://youtu.be/iz1rIp1-b-Y">Break My Soul</a>.</p><p><em>Central City</em> bears the hallmarks of all this success, in its own vintage guest list (Ciara, Faith Evans, Lil Wayne), high production values and songcraft. One of the chief appeals of bounce was always its raucous minimalism, where sampled and looped phrases did battle with choppy old-school productions. If there is an eyebrow to raise at this 16-track workout, it’s the proliferation of actual songs with actual vocals. Motivate Ya features the soulful Kelly Price on the hook and scans like pop music, rather than a pile-driver designed to level a club. Already released, <a href="https://youtu.be/LyIbbeg6oP0">$100 Bill</a> features not only Ciara, but heightened levels of musicality (as well as air horns). Mercifully, there are tracks such as <a href="https://youtu.be/K0wZLIPsn7Q">Bigfoot</a>, a low-slung, bass-laden beast of a track, plus bodily humour on Pepto Interlude (“I got cramps!”) and Booty Like a Drummer, a mighty endorphin rush made of beats and shouting.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/25/big-freedia-central-city-review-new-orleans-bounce-beyonce-break-my-soul">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Plans for the world’s first commercial octopus farm are well advanced – just as science discovers more about this curious, intelligent and affectionate animal. Can it be done ethically?</p><p>The sterile boardroom, much of it taken up by a lengthy white table, is at the heart of the sprawling building in northern Spain. The corporate chatter that fills this room these days, however, is dominated by the scene playing out one floor below, where about 50 adult male octopuses are in a tank the size of a budget hotel room.</p><p>A handful of the octopuses – the fifth generation to be born in this Spanish multinational’s concrete-and-glass office and research centre – skim through the shallow waters, some brushing up against each other while others tuck into the tank’s barren corners. A low-intensity light casts a pale glow as researchers lay the groundwork for one of the world’s most controversial endeavours: the first commercial octopus farm.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/25/a-symbol-of-what-humans-shouldnt-be-doing-the-new-world-of-octopus-farming">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In an extract from her new memoir, the Observer art critic tells the story of two paintings: one a source of comfort during a doomed affair, the other an unforgettable vision created by her father</p><p>I love a painting that hangs in the National Gallery in London. It has to me the atmosphere of a memory or a waking dream. It shows a man seated in deep shadow at the corner of two streets, thumb to chin and fingers crooked as if nursing the remains of a cigarette, eyes down and pensive; waiting.</p><p>Two musical instruments lie next to him on a table: a lute, shining like a new chestnut freed from the husk, and a viola that reaches invitingly towards you as if just asking for its strings to be plucked. For you are here too, somehow, hovering on exact eye level with the man and his table. The painting, so small and mysterious, is peculiarly alive to the nearness of your presence. It puts you on the spot on this quiet day when the leaves of the young elms are just beginning to turn and the man in black sits low at the crossroads. Before him, the cobbles rise up and over the gently swelling bridge into a brighter world of red-roofed houses and church spires and dappled light elsewhere. But he remains forever on the outskirts.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/25/fabritius-my-father-and-me-how-art-has-shaped-my-life">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I’ve previously shunned self-improvement, because it is not fun, but while tending for a garden, I am able to work on myself</p><p>How do you go about being good? I ask because I’ve been hung up recently on trying to be, well… better. It’s a bit ridiculous and embarrassing; also, if asked to corroborate, my family would definitely say they haven’t noticed. I’m not aiming for saintly. I haven’t started believing some celestial bouncer will decide whether I get to live on a cloud with Captain Tom, or send me downstairs to change king-sized duvet covers and parallel park for all eternity watched by Hitler and Stalin while listening to HMRC hold music.

## ‘I’m not that geeky guy any more’: Simon Pegg on comedy, action heroes and staying at home

<p>Simon Pegg has called time on the nerdy stuff, and says he’d rather watch Succession than sci-fi. As for his A-list status, friendship with Tom Cruise and box-office pulling power – well, he’d take Hertfordshire over Hollywood any time</p><p>Last summer, the actor and writer Simon Pegg and the writer-director Edgar Wright holed up for a week at Pegg’s home in Hertfordshire to see if they could break ground on a fourth feature film together. Their previous three, aka the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2013/jul/17/worlds-end-simon-pegg-nick-frost-video" title="">Cornetto Trilogy</a> – <em>Shaun of the Dead</em> (2004), <em>Hot Fuzz</em> (2007) and <em>The</em> <em>World’s End</em> (2013) – are all standards on any list of the best British films of the 21st century, and have made both Pegg and Wright bona-fide Hollywood heavyweights. (The pair also created <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/11/the-stars-of-spaced-reunited-21st-anniversary-simon-pegg-jessica-hynes-edgar-wright-nick-frost" title="">Spaced</a></em>, one of the all-time great sitcoms, which Pegg wrote and starred in with Jessica Hynes.) But progress on film number four, Pegg admits, wrinkling his nose, was slow.</p><p>Was it the pressure of following those previous iconic films? Pegg shakes his head. “Edgar bought his dog, Peter, and Peter was very distracting,” he replies, in his West Country-inflected half-drawl. “I have three dogs; they are schnauzers, too. Well, two now, but I had three then, and they’re quite well-behaved. But Peter’s a little rascal.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jun/25/simon-pegg-actor-on-comedy-action-heroes-tom-cruise-staying-at-home">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The writer-director’s knowing meta-tale set in a space-obsessed 1950s desert town has a starry cast and meticulous attention to detail, but its studied quirkiness is often more irritating than amusing</p><p>No one goes to a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/wes-anderson">Wes Anderson</a> movie expecting heartfelt melodrama or realistic human emotions and interactions.

At best, these range from the piercingly acute family portraits of <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/mar/17/features.review">The Royal Tenenbaums</a></em> (2001) to the bittersweet comedy capers of <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/mar/09/the-grand-budapest-hotel-review-wes-anderson">The Grand Budapest Hotel</a></em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/mar/09/the-grand-budapest-hotel-review-wes-anderson"> </a>(2014) and the delightfully off-the-wall stop-motion animation of <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/01/isle-of-dogs-review-wes-anderson">Isle of Dogs</a></em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/01/isle-of-dogs-review-wes-anderson"> </a>(2018).

Fans will doubtless be dazzled by its meticulous imitation-of-life-in-miniature visual aesthetic, yet I swithered between whimsical amusement, mild curiosity and outright irritation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/25/asteroid-city-review-smug-wes-anderson-comedy-falls-to-earth">Continue reading...</a>

As her sophomore directorial venture approaches its 30th year, Sleepless in Seattle remains famously unrivaled in the sheer brilliance of its feat: a love story in which the lovers share roughly 2 minutes of screen time. Ephron’s bold tribute to the cinematic romances of her youth is one deviously elaborate, protracted journey to the “meet-cute”.

The comedian on pork belly lunches, cocktails and smashing the karaoke<p><strong>​​Wake-up time? </strong>My optimum time is 8am. I recently bought this little machine, like an 80s Teasmade, for coffee, so I get woken by the smell of fresh coffee. I have to be gently stroked awake. I can’t bear alarms. To me, that’s the sound of something bad happening.</p><p><strong>What’s for breakfast? </strong>A cinnamon bun or something potato-based, like a hash with chorizo and runny-yolked egg on top. I’ll make it myself. I’m a very good cook. My scrambled eggs are incredible. Angela Hartnett taught my mate Jess how to make them – low and slow, gorgeously silky and buttery – and Jess taught me.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/25/jayde-adams-comedian-sundays-pork-belly-lunches-cocktails-karaoke">Continue reading...</a>

## It took years to learn the deadly lessons of cigarettes. We can’t wait so long for vaping | Sonia Sodha

Nicotine is a drug that shouldn’t be dressed up in cartoon packaging and sweet shop flavours<p>Blueberry bubblegum. Lemon pie. Caramel cheesecake. Sickly-sweet concoctions that are just a fraction of the dessert-flavoured nicotine vapes available to buy in newsagents for not much more than a high-end chocolate bar, in bright packaging often adorned with cartoon illustrations designed to appeal to children. It is a huge red flag that something has gone seriously amiss in the rules that govern e-cigarette marketing and sales in the UK.</p><p>What makes the question of how to regulate vaping more complex than cigarettes or alcohol is that, unlike with the latter two substances – where a collective fall in consumption would be an unambiguously good thing for the nation’s health – public health experts want to encourage smokers to switch from cigarettes to vapes while keeping non-smokers, particularly children and young people, well away from vaping.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/25/it-took-years-to-learn-the-deadly-lessons-of-cigarettes-we-cant-wait-so-long-for-vaping">Continue reading...</a>

## Sunscreens: 10 of the best

It’s on our minds in summer, but sun protection should be a year-round beauty habit<p>This is groundhog day. Because, of course, we’ve been here many times before. It is summer and I am writing about SPF – which feels unimaginative, but its importance needs reiteration. SPF is not a summer product and I wish people would stop touting it as such. Unless you live in complete darkness or live in a windowless house and never venture out, you need sunscreen all year round. Beyond the pain – quite literally – of sunburn, you open the door to pigmentation issues, premature ageing and, more seriously, the potential of skin cancer. Body sunscreen not playing a role in your daily skincare routine all year round – I totally get. Thanks to the usually disappointing British weather – the heatwave is a fluke – if our necks get to see the light of day it’s a miracle. We are covered up so much of the year that to slather your body with sunscreen every day takes serious dedication. For now, however, both face and body suncare is necessary. Think of it simply as an extension of your beauty ritual, one that will keep the quality and health of your skin in good nick. It’s a no-brainer. But I can imagine I will still need to write this at the same time next year.</p><p><strong>1.

## Lana Del Rey at Glastonbury review – modern pop’s greatest auteur gets cut off in her prime

<p><strong>Other stage<br /></strong>At her first UK show in four years, the enigmatic singer-songwriter takes her ultra-devoted fans on a stupendous tour through her back catalogue – before being escorted off</p><p>There were few sets at this year’s Glastonbury festival more anticipated than Lana Del Rey’s Saturday night Other stage headline slot. It’s been nearly 10 years since the cult American singer-songwriter last played on Worthy Farm; in that time, she’s released six albums and established herself as one of pop music’s greatest living songwriters, period – a bold and experimental musician whose renown only seems to grow as her music becomes more introspective and self-referential. Her latest record, Did You Know That There’s a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd, is already one of the year’s most acclaimed, and one of the strangest pop records to be released in recent memory: across the sprawling, conceptually dense album, Del Rey samples herself three times, collaborates with “fetish rapper” Tommy Genesis, and, for the first time in her career, writes openly about her family and personal history.</p><p>At the time of writing, Lana is the 27th most streamed musician in the world on Spotify – an impossibly huge feat, given how idiosyncratic, and downright anti-pop, her vision of pop music is. While Del Rey will probably never be played on pop radio, her fans are devoutly loyal – more so, perhaps, than the fans of many other pop stars. They prove their devotion at the end of Del Rey’s set: after walking on stage 30 minutes late, her sound is cut at midnight, after a raucous, exhilaratingly dense-sounding rendition of the 2017 song White Mustang. Del Rey pleads with various stage managers as the gargantuan Other stage crowd watch on, aghast; she is eventually escorted offstage, and the crew packing up her gear are met with emphatic, resounding boos.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/25/lana-del-rey-at-glastonbury-review-other-stage">Continue reading...</a>

Theatre audiences are gripped by James Graham’s story of Gareth Southgate’s team, and the first Ashes Test was almost unwatchably tense<p>In 1986, the England cricketer Ian Botham was suspended for 63 days after admitting to smoking marijuana. It might not sound like much now, but back then the story was huge: Botham, or “Beefy” as he was known, was England’s most high-profile sports star, and we were a lot more puritanical about pot in those days.</p><p>Some newspapers had called for a lifetime ban. So it felt like everyone was watching when <a href="https://sport360.com/article/other/more-sports/190064/bothams-record-breaking-return" title="">Botham made his return</a> against New Zealand. The day started quietly enough, but after half an hour, Botham was brought on to bowl. He charged in, his lion’s mane flapping, and his first delivery caught the edge of the Kiwi opener’s bat. It was caught! Botham had tied the world record for all-time Test wickets. “Blimey Beef,” said his teammate Graham Gooch. “Who writes your scripts?” Gooch was right: it was a ridiculously stagey comeback. Had that scene featured in a work of fiction, it would have looked unearned. We expect our protagonists to struggle and suffer a little more than that. And the truth is that sport routinely creates drama that could never translate to the page or the screen. That’s why sports movies are often so terrible and cliched: films either end with the underdog winning or losing pluckily (while learning an important life lesson). Dramatised re-enactments of sport just can’t compete with the real thing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/25/observer-view-translating-nail-biting-sport-to-stage-screen">Continue reading...</a>

## Cool reds to drink when it’s hot | David Williams

As the temperature rises, chilled white wines aren’t the only things to enjoy - try these reds from Beaujolais and the Loire<p><strong>Extra Special Fleurie, Beaujolais, France 2022 (£9, <a href="https://www.asda.com/">Asda</a>)</strong> If we are asked to picture a summer wine, most of us will think of crisp whites and rosés, with and without bubbles. These are the wines that we instinctively associate with refreshment, that we pour straight from the fridge or the ice bucket, that match the lighter foods we tend to eat when the temperature rises. But there are certain reds that also fit the definition, wines that respond just as well to being served with a bit of a chill, and which have their own way of slaking the thirst and matching an alfresco meal. For me, this time of the year always comes with a craving for the wines of the two French regions that have mastered the art of the summer red, Beaujolais and the Loire. While a crisp white will bring the mouthwatering qualities of citrus, these are wines that, in their different ways, bring the refreshment of the just-ripe berry or currant: wines, such as Asda’s Fleurie, that are light in body, high in acidity, and with a sappy quality to their juicy burst of red fruit.</p><p><strong>Domaine du Pré Baron Touraine Gamay, Touraine, Loire, France 2021 (from £9.79, <a href="https://www.allaboutwine.co.uk/">allaboutwine.co.uk</a>; <a href="https://talkingwines.co.uk/">talkingwines.co.uk</a>; <a href="https://www.rannochscott.co.uk/">rannochscott.co.uk</a>)</strong> Other mouthwatering Beaujolais bottles that I have loved recently and that would make a perfect match with salad and a steak, a plate of charcuterie or a meze selection (Beaujolais is a brilliantly versatile food wine) include the easeful supple feel and raspberry juiciness of <a href="https://www.marksandspencer.com/">M&amp;S</a> Classic Beaujolais Villages 2022 (£10), the silky, deep immersion in berry land of Thibault Ducroux En Roue Libre Beaujolais 2021 (£18.95, <a href="https://thesourcingtable.com/pages/shop">thesourcingtable.com</a>), and the vividly fruit-filled flow of Domaine Chapel Beaujolais Villages 2021 (£21.95, <a href="https://nattyboywines.co.uk/">nattyboywines.co.uk</a>). All red Beaujolais (the region does make a little, often rather good, white wine, too) is made from the gamay variety, which is also one of the red grapes used to make summer wines in the Loire, with the summer-pudding compote exuberance of Domaine du Pré Baron’s example from Touraine offering an intriguing point of comparison with Beaujolais.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/25/cool-reds-to-enjoy-when-its-hot-beaujolais-and-the-loire">Continue reading...</a>

History records the latter to be a shortening of a filthy and anatomically descriptive name for what used to take place here; one which I would never get past the editors of a family newspaper. Look it up. Here, in the other direction, comes a long, informal parade of chaps in three-piece suits, as if just out of a meeting. Is that the badge of the Rotarians on their lapels? Or are they Freemasons? Hard to tell from up here. But, oh my, look at that explosion of facial hair. There really are some quite magnificent beards in York these days.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/25/los-moros-york-restaurant-review-a-lot-going-on-in-a-very-small-space">Continue reading...</a>

It’s possible to honour the memory of your lost love, while also finding happiness elsewhere<p><em><strong>The question </strong>My man died of cancer five years ago. He was 61. We had children and grandchildren. He had been “the man of my life” for the last 35 years. We were in love. Each day, each night, we told each other how we were feeling good together. Our life was just as we wished it could be. We had a small country house where he was living full-time since he retired and, as I was still working, I came back home from my work every Friday night for the weekend. We were like two lovebirds meeting again.</em></p><p><em>You can imagine how painful it was to lose him. Each day during the years after his death, everything made me think of him: music, snow, sun, rain, food, films… It was very hard to sell our house. But I had to do it and I did. I am having to rebuild my life brick by brick, but it feels as if joy will never come back.</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/25/the-love-of-my-life-has-died-how-can-i-ever-be-free-to-live-again">Continue reading...</a>

Workload, poor pupil behaviour, the pressure of Ofsted… no wonder people like me are leaving the profession in droves<p>I’m sad – but also greatly relieved – to say that I’m one of the many English teachers quitting the profession this summer (“<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jun/17/trying-to-find-a-maths-or-science-teacher-is-like-looking-for-a-unicorn-inside-english-schools-recruitment-crisis" title="">Trying to find a maths or science teacher is like looking for a unicorn</a>”, News). On leaving, I will have completed 12 years of teaching across secondary schools in London and North Yorkshire. In happier times, I would tell everyone how privileged I felt to spend my day in the company of young people and their amazing energy, especially as I could do so with a Shakespeare play in my hand. Yes, there were always a lot of stresses, but I was certain that I smiled and laughed each workday more than the huge majority of the population.</p><p>Well, for the last year those smiles have all but dried up. The stress has become too much. Burnout has ravaged me. There are many reasons: worsening student behaviour since Covid; the workload; Ofsted pressures; tedious obsessions with targets and data; growing class sizes; a lack of funding and resources; a lack of pay and appreciation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2023/jun/25/teacher-exodus-leaves-us-all-poorer-letters">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Pyramid stage</strong><br />With a beaming Dave Grohl guesting on guitar and hits interspersed with homages to their influences, Axl and co make for hard-rocking – yet surprisingly polite – Saturday headliners</p><p>The most immediately startling thing about Guns N’ Roses’ headlining set is how polite Axl Rose is. He’s the famously unpredictable frontman of a band who, in their late 80s heyday, oozed druggy negativity: their debut album Appetite for Destruction painted such a relentlessly grim and grimy picture of life in Los Angeles that Justin Quirk’s brilliant history of 80s metal Nothin’ But a Good Time posits the theory that its release, rather than the arrival of Nirvana, spelled the end of the hair metal era and irreparably punctured its facade of sleazy glamour. Now, in his 60s, he’s turned into a surprisingly well mannered character. “We’d like to thank you for inviting us,” he offers. “Have you had a good day? Glad to hear it.”</p><p>But the current iteration of Guns N’ Roses sound remarkably vital: the twin guitars of Slash and Richard Fortus playing off against each other, drummer Frank Ferrer underpinning the songs with a surprising degree of funk and swing. If Axl Rose’s falsetto sounds a little rougher around the edges than it did thirtysomething years ago, he still hits the high notes. Less weird-looking now than in the years when he sported braids and a goatee beard, he still pulls off the selection of onstage moves identified by the American writer John Jeremiah Sullivan in his superb 2006 essay The Final Comeback of Axl Rose: stalking, cartoonish pugnaciousness; snaky slide-foot dance; dammit just dropped a bowling ball on my foot spin-with-mic-stand dance; prance sideways with mic stand like an attacking staff-wielding ritual warrior between-verses dance.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/25/guns-n-roses-at-glastonbury-review-pyramid-stage">Continue reading...</a>
