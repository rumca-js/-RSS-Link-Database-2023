ARE THEY REALLY \u2018INDIAN\u2019 ??", "description": "I am currently residing in Berlin, Germany. During my recent trip to Innsbruck, I stumbled upon an Indian restaurant named 'Jaipur' located in close proximity to popular tourist attractions. Although I typically do not seek out Indian cuisine while traveling internationally, I had specific reasons for visiting this restaurant. I was initially hesitant about the taste's authenticity due to my past experiences in different countries. #Innsbruck #Austria #Mountaintrekker \n\nIf you like my videos, PLEASE SHARE them and let others get inspired to explore this beautiful world.

I love solo travelling & meeting people. After travelling extensively in Incredible India for years, I stepped out of my country and realised, how beautiful the world is! I started making travel web series in Hindi full of travel tips and tricks, especially for budget travel and sustainable tourism. My dream is to inspire people to explore this beautiful world and learn the best things to make our world a better place to live in. I was awarded the prestigious 'National Tourism Award' by the Government of India for my contributions in the field of promotion of Tourism. Thanks to my viewers, I now get invitations from across the globe to visit their places and show them to the world.\n\nSUPPORT ME \n# MY AMAZON AFFILIATE LINKS - \nIndia - https://bit.ly/MTamazonindia\nUSA - https://bit.ly/MTamazonusa23\nCanada - https://bit.ly/MTamazoncanada\nUK - https://bit.ly/MTamazonuk\nGermany - https://bit.ly/MTamazonde\nFrance - https://bit.ly/MTamazonfrance23\nItaly - https://bit.ly/MTamazonitaly23\nSpain - https://bit.ly/MTamazonspain23\nor https://www.amazon.in/shop/mountaintrekker \n(click here, type whatever you want in the search bar & buy)\n\n# BOOK HOTELS & HELP ME \nhttp://bit.ly/bookhotelhelpme - Your hotel bookings from this link can fetch me a small amount\n\n# JOIN MY CLUB, BECOME A MEMBER \nhttp://bit.ly/joinMT - I make exclusive videos for members, quite informative\n\n# BUY THINGS, I USE WHILE TRAVELLING https://www.touristhelpline.com/varun-vagish-travel-kit/ \n\n# VOLUNTEER & TRAVEL FOR FREE\nWorkaway code (1 month free) - https://bit.ly/MTworkaway\nWorldpacker (20US$ discount) - http://bit.ly/MTvolunteering\n\n# MUSIC I USE\nhttps://bit.ly/MTmusicsource\n\nFOLLOW ME ON\n# INSTAGRAM - https://www.instagram.com/varunvagish/ \n# FACEBOOK - https://www.facebook.com/varun.vagish \n# TWITTER - https://twitter.com/varunvagish \n# EMAIL (Only Business) - business@touristhelpline.com \n\nIf you have any queries, feel free to ask at - www.facebook.com/groups/touristhelpline (It may not be possible for me to answer every question here, but other members, travellers, and travel experts in this group can help you)", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsO9UGPzE_k", "date_published": "2023-06-25 03:29:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
