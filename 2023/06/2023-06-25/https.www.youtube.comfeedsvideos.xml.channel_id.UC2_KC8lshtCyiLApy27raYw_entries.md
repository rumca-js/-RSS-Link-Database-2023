Iron man and Spiderman and flash man used to be cool but they ain’t anymore.

I don’t make the rules.

I’ve decided that I’m the best suited person for determining what’s cool and what isn’t and so I’ve decided that these things are not cool anymore.

They are lame.

Today I’m going to talk about why they are lame.

Or at least, that was my intention.

I don’t remember if I entirely managed to convey my points here.
