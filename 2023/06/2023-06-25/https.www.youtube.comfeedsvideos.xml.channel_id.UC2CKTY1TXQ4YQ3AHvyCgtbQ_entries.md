Leviathan is out in people's hands now - and hopefully, if you wanted one - you got one. We'll talk about whether you got one or weren't able to, and what I'm planning to work on next, and of course, I'll answer your wargaming-related questions. Come have fun!

Vince Venturella and I made another game! Check out MAJESTIC 13 at http://www.majestic13game.com

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
