Between the absence of a Bloodborne 2 and the ever-growing fan interest for the same, developers have tried to create games that could fill that void to varying degrees of success. But NEOWIZ’s upcoming project, Lies of P looks like a game that could surpass the legacy of Bloodborne and act as a spiritual successor to that game. The game tasks players to regain their long-lost humanity while navigating a complex web of lies and conspiracies in the monster-infested city of Krat. 

You must make your way through looping levels filled with hideous clockwork creatures and defeat them by mastering the tough but fast combat loop of swift strikes and timely dodges. Lies of P also features customizable weapons and swappable prosthetic arms that add a lot of depth and variety to the combat loop, and we’ll be checking it out when it releases on September 19 this year.

Implementing good combat in any game is a challenge, whether it's considering the systems, mechanics, controls or the enemies that players will fight. Then you have to worry about responsiveness and how it all feels. With all that in mind, Final Fantasy 16's combat is simply superb.

As a real-time, hack-and-slash RPG, it nails the essentials of melee combat and spell-casting. The Eikonic Skills add extensive depth while fueling the power fantasy, allowing you to slay crowds of foes or break the Will gauge of tougher enemies. That's not including the incredible boss battles or the Eikon Battles, which deliver on an epic scale.

With Final Fantasy 16 available worldwide on PS5, find out everything that makes the combat compelling here.

Crash Team Rumble subverts even the most dismal of expectations by offering a fun and engaging multiplayer arena clash. There’s far more to this title than fighting the other team or simply collecting Wumpa Fruit to score points. Rumble has a degree of nuance and strategy at its core that will find favor with long-time fans of the orange marsupial.

 Furthermore, the same tried-and-true platforming controls and gameplay are present and employed well in this new offering. With clever map design and countless tricks available to the most conniving players, Rumble will undoubtedly engage a sizable audience. The title’s major drawback is a lack of game mode options that could potentially keep it from entertaining longevity with the masses. Still, there’s enough here to warrant the attention of series fans.
