  <p id="rJXrr5">US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Friday there may be some airline delays or cancellations starting July 1st if the last remaining passenger jets haven’t upgraded their altimeters to deal with 5G interference, per a report from <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/pete-buttigieg-warns-of-flight-delays-as-5g-deadline-looms-bc4ab236"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> report. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763502/verizon-att-cband-5g-faa-delay-safety-aircraft">maintains</a> that 5G C-band signals could interfere with radio wave emitters passenger jets use to measure how far they are from the ground, which pilots rely on when landing with low visibility. </p>
<p id="JyXnxo">Though airlines aren’t actually required to get the new equipment in place <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/10/23547653/faa-airplane-5g-altimeter-filter-replacement">until February 2024</a>, those passenger jets that haven’t been certified for operation around C-band 5G signals by the first of July will not be allowed to land in...</p>
