Under a deal brokered by Belarus, Prigozhin agreed to leave Russia and move to Belarus. He will not face charges and Wagner troops who took part in the rebellion will not face any action in recognition of their previous service to Russia.</p><p><strong>In a statement, Prigozhin said that he wanted to avoid the spilling of “Russian blood”</strong>. “Now the moment has come when blood can be shed,” he said. “Therefore, realising all the responsibility for the fact that Russian blood will be shed from one side, we will turn our convoys around and go in the opposite direction to our field camps.”</p><p><strong>The Wagner leader was later pictured leaving the headquarters of the southern military district (SMD) in Rostov, which his forces had occupied on Saturday</strong>. Wagner forces also shot down three military helicopters and had entered the Lipetsk region, about 360km (225 miles) south of Moscow, before they were called back.</p><p><strong>Belarus president Alexander Lukashenko’s press office was the first to announce that Prigozhin would be backing down</strong>, saying that Lukashenko had negotiated a de-escalation with the Wagner head after talking to Russian president Vladimir Putin. Lukashenko said that Putin has since thanked him for his negotiation efforts.</p><p><strong>Putin has not publicly commented on Lukashenko’s deal with Prigozhin</strong>. He appeared on television earlier on Saturday in an emergency broadcast, issuing a nationwide call for unity in the face of a mutinous strike that he compared to the revolution of 1917. “Any internal mutiny is a deadly threat to our state, to us as a nation,” he said.</p><p><strong>Putin reportedly took a plane out of Moscow heading north-west on Saturday afternoon</strong>. It is unclear where he went or his current whereabouts.</p><p><strong>Before the Belarus deal was announced, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that: “Everyone who chooses the path of evil destroys himself.</strong> Whoever throws hundreds of thousands into the war, eventually must barricade himself in the Moscow region from those whom he himself armed.”</p><p><strong>Ukraine’s military said on Saturday its forces made advances near Bakhmut, on the eastern front, and further south</strong>.
