There's also a lack of definitive research on how VR can affect depth perception and focusing.

The lawsuit was filed after consumer data privacy concerns were raised by the state in its latest legal battle with Meta, according to a <a href=\"https://www.law360.com/articles/1688438/pfizer-others-must-share-ad-records-in-meta-suit-texas-says\"><ins>report</ins></a> by Law360. The Texas Attorney General claims that millions of Texas residents have had their private biometric data misappropriated over the past ten years.</p><p>The order requires the vaccine maker to share any records it holds regarding Meta\u2019s use of facial recognition technology over claims that the company was collecting biometric data from Facebook users without their consent. This decree over Pfizer\u2019s records follows a February 2022 filing against Meta by the Texas Attorney General that <a href=\"https://texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/images/child-support/State%20of%20Texas%20v.%20Meta%20Platforms%20Inc..pdf\"><ins>claimed</ins></a> \u201cFacebook knowingly captured biometric information for its own commercial benefit\u201d in order to \u201ctrain and improve\u201d its in-house facial recognition technology powered by AI. The Texas lawsuit cites Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerburg\u2019s commentary that photo tagging is \u201cmore important than every other [Facebook] feature put together\u201d as evidence in their case against the company under a section that highlights its allegations against the company. The February 2022 petition against Meta over data privacy concerns came shortly after <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/facebook-shuts-down-face-recognition-171737198.html\"><ins>Facebook decided to discontinue</ins></a> its face recognition systems in 2021. Meta <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/11/update-on-use-of-face-recognition/\"><ins>said</ins></a> its move to cut back on its facial recognition tech development was necessary because of the lack of regulator guidelines.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The Texas Attorney General has been aggressive in its pursuit of Meta\u2019s data on the issue. The state has cast a wide net with its series of lawsuits, subpoenaing a number of other big-name companies affiliated with the company through its advertising arm. Pfizer is just one of many companies subpoenaed in the attempt to discover data incriminating Meta. Others ordered to turn over advertising data include Procter &amp; Gamble, Home Depot, The New York Times, SmileDirectClub and Clarity Media Group. Although the exact investment value of Pfizer\u2019s advertising deals with Meta are undisclosed, we do know the company\u2019s \u201cselling, general, and administrative expenses,\u201d which include marketing and advertising, <a href=\"https://s28.q4cdn.com/781576035/files/doc_financials/2022/q4/Q4-2022-PFE-Earnings-Release.pdf\"><ins>reached a whopping $34 billion in 2022.</ins><br /><br /></a>Meta is hardly the only name in big tech being targeted by the Texas AG over data privacy concerns. Google is similarly facing the Texas Attorney General in court over its facial data collection practices. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/texas-attorney-general-sues-google-over-its-facial-recognition-practices-161942788.html\"><ins>Last year</ins></a>, Google was sued by Texas for engaging in \u201cyears-long practices\u201d of capturing biometric data from millions of Texans without consent. In that same year in a separate lawsuit with the state of Illinois, Google paid $100 million to settle a class action that accused the tech giant of violating the Biometric Information Protection Act. The case resembles the Texas suit filed against Meta, which claims the company violated Texas\u2019 Capture or Use of Biometric Identifier Act. Confirmation that a violation of that specific Texas act by Meta can result in a penalty of up to $25,000 per violation of the law. So far, an infraction fine against the social media giant has not been determined.<br /><br />Both Pfizer and the Texas AG office could not be reached to comment on the ongoing case.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/texas-ag-subpoenas-pfizer-to-release-meta-ad-records-160736593.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/texas-ag-subpoenas-pfizer-to-release-meta-ad-records-160736593.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-16 16:07:36+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Google's designers on why the Pixel Fold isn't just another foldable", "description": "<p>Ever since the release of the original <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-22-samsung-galaxy-fold-review-expensive-experiment.html\">Galaxy Fold back in 2019</a>, Samsung has basically enjoyed a monopoly on big handsets with bendy screens. But with the imminent arrival of the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-officially-reveals-the-pixel-fold-174726500.html\">Pixel Fold</a> later this month, Google is hoping to break that stranglehold. That said, with Samsung having already released four generations of its flagship foldable, Google can't afford to simply iterate on a rival's design. In an interview ahead of the Pixel Fold's release, two of Google\u2019s product managers (PM) \u2014 George Hwang and Andrea Zvinakis \u2014 sat down to shed some insight on why now, what the company is doing differently, and how its upcoming flexible phone will impact future devices.</p><p>The first thing I noticed during my <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-fold-hands-on-finally-a-real-rival-for-samsungs-foldables-185253034.html\">hands-on</a> was the Pixel Fold\u2019s shape. Instead of having a long and skinny baton-like chassis similar to the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review-specs-price-a-flagship-foldable-refined-131543810.html\">Galaxy Z Fold 4</a>, Google opted for a wider frame shaped more like a passport, which was an intentional decision by Google. Hwang, who is a PM on the Pixel Fold team told me that \u201cwhen we talk about the Pixel Fold, we often talk about the outer display first.\u201d</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img alt=\"An engineer's sketch shows some of the inner workings of the Pixel Fold. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/5e6c4760-0bd8-11ee-bf93-f2376fecac9f\" style=\"height: 1152px; width: 2048px;\" /><figcaption>In this design sketch, you can see how the Pixel Fold's hinge is positioned on the very edge of the device, which greatly impacted the phone's overall design</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Google</div></figure><p>Hwang says the reason for this is that more than 50 percent of interactions people have with their phones are less than two minutes long \u2014 things like texting a friend, changing a song or simply setting an alarm. \u201cOur focus on form factor was critical and quite intentional to make sure that we offered a usable exterior display, such that you could use the phone like you want to.\u201d</p><p>While using the Pixel Fold\u2019s outside display like you would a regular phone might sound kind of obvious, it was also a bit of a surprise. Typically, when people discuss foldables, much of the attention is reserved for that fancy flexible screen on the inside. But more importantly, that touches on a few of Google\u2019s overarching design goals for the Pixel Fold: Being able to use it like a regular handset even when you\u2019re only using it closed, allowing users to open the Fold to augment their experience and then making sure that even though it's a larger device, it\u2019s still a feasible daily driver.</p><figure><img alt=\"For Engadget's interview about the Pixel Fold, we talked to two of Google's product managers: George Hwang (left) and Andrea Zvinakis (right). \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/8f51ac80-0bd8-11ee-bff7-2c3616f87e40\" style=\"height: 1500px; width: 3000px;\" /><figcaption>For Engadget's interview about the Pixel Fold, we talked to two of Google's product managers: George Hwang (left) from the Pixel Fold team and Andrea Zvinakis (right) from the Android platforms team.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Google</div></figure><p>As for using that big interior display to enhance the device\u2019s capabilities, it feels like much of the Pixel Fold\u2019s potential lies in the marriage between hardware and software. As someone who works on Google\u2019s Android platform team, Zvinakis highlighted the importance of continuity and posture for the Pixel Fold. \u201cIf we were just designing for tablets, you could just create one large screen, he said, &quot;whereas for foldables you\u2019re often unfolding to continue a session.\u201d</p><p>When designing an app or UI for a foldable device, Google needs to consider things like buttons or other elements that may fall in the Pixel Fold\u2019s crease. But it also means being able to open the device without losing your place, which often feels like an elusive goal. But when it works, it provides a sense of instant adaptability that you just can\u2019t get from a traditional phone.</p><figure><img alt=\"For the Pixel Fold, one of Google's main goals was to create a 5.8-inch exterior display that was more usable than similar offerings on rival phones. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/f6b73f70-0bd8-11ee-9fbf-27405f03869f\" style=\"height: 1200px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption>For the Pixel Fold, one of Google's main goals was to make the phone's 5.8-inch exterior display as usable as possible so that people don't feel forced to use the larger main display for certain tasks. </figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Google</div></figure><p>Continuity also impacts posture, which is the position of the phone\u2019s screen from open to closed and every angle in between. Due to the Pixel Fold\u2019s flexible design, not only does Google need to track how the device is oriented, it\u2019s important to anticipate how components like the phone\u2019s cameras and UI adjust and move and behave depending on its posture. \u201cWe want there to be a user benefit to unfolding the device rather than just seeing an expanded phone layout,\u201d Zvinakis said. \u201cThat's why we created things like dual shade for notification that leverages both sides of the display.\u201d</p><p>But what\u2019s even more exciting is how Zvinakis says posture detection can unlock entirely new use cases like <a href=\"https://youtu.be/9wobcM-WPQk?t=79\">dual-screen interpreter mode</a> on the Pixel Fold. This allows users to hold the phone in a position so that two people can see a different language get translated in real-time \u2014 each with their own display \u2014 which cuts down on the typical back and forth that happens when everyone has to share a single screen. And while we\u2019ve seen some other novel uses of foldable phones like taking high-res selfies with the rear camera while using a phone\u2019s exterior display, there are a growing number of functions available on foldable you simply can\u2019t get when using a traditional glass brick.</p><figure><img alt=\"While the Pixel Fold is a large device, Google focused on making it extremely thin (less than 6mm) so that it would still feel like a feasible daily driver. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/33af4f80-0bd9-11ee-a77b-edc791b42597\" style=\"height: 1200px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption>While the Pixel Fold is a large device, Google focused on making it extremely thin (less than 6mm) so that it would still feel like a feasible daily driver. </figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Google</div></figure><p>There are other elements that are needed for foldables to reach their true potential. Take, for example, the Fold\u2019s taskbar, which needs to straddle the line between enabling short mobile interactions and more complex multitasking situations. \u201cWe launched a taskbar with <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/android-12-l-hands-on-some-big-multitasking-upgrades-but-is-it-enough-180002295.html\">Android 12L</a> in March of last year and the first version was basically a pinned taskbar that you had to long press to hide and long press to show,\u201d Zvinakis said. \u201cBut as we did more testing, users said they found that behavior a little clunky. So instead we refined it into a more transient taskbar where you can access it with a short swipe, drag any app into split-screen and then it automatically closes when you\u2019re not using it.\u201d</p><p>The big challenge is combining competing design elements, like the thinness of the device, while still supporting sophisticated components such as the phone\u2019s 5x optical zoom. So to get over that hump, Hwang issued a challenge to the team to make a device that was more than just a collection of components: &quot;If you don't want to use it every day, then it's not a device that we want to ship.&quot;</p><figure><img alt=\"For apps like YouTube that have optimized tabletop modes, it's very important for the Pixel Fold to be able to accurately detect its posture, which includes the orientation and position of its screen. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/606effc0-0bd9-11ee-bbff-48aa4533192b\" style=\"height: 1200px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption>For apps like YouTube that have optimized tabletop modes, it's very important for the Pixel Fold to be able to accurately detect its posture, which includes the orientation and position of its screen. </figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Google</div></figure><p>The quest for thinness is far more important for foldables than other phones. \u201cWe realized that if this thing was thick and bulky it's not something you'd really want to have in your pocket all day long,&quot; Hwang said. \u201cI think the thing that was a key enabler was the hinge. How the hinge is architected drives everything around the foldable display. It's kind of symbiotic.\u201d</p><p>This was a somewhat unexpected revelation because, as someone who has owned multiple generations of the Galaxy Z Fold line, I thought the hinge issues had been solved after all the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-14-samsung-galaxy-fold-redesign-review-durability-screen.html\">issues with the original model</a>. \u201cWhat you see in most foldables is that you'll have hinge mechanisms across the full length of the hinge at three to four different spots,\u201d Hwang said. \u201cBut the thing is that now that you have hinge components in the middle of the device, that drives the thickness of what we call the stack and then you have the display on top.\u201d</p><figure><img alt=\"The Pixel Fold's interior display features a landscape orientation which makes it better for watching movies without needing to rotate the phone. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/02e29cb0-eef4-11ed-baee-b10bb903b80b\" style=\"height: 1200px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption>While the Pixel Fold's flexible display does have a crease, Google has done some innovative things with the screen's fold geometry to minimize its appearance. </figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>So Hwang thought \u201cif those are the limiting factors, then is there a way we can creatively move those components somewhere else?\u201d So in the end what the Pixel Fold team did was relocate the phone\u2019s two hinges to the very edge of the device bringing it out of plane, which had a number of important effects. She says not only does this decrease thickness, \u201cit also helps drive the largest delta between the outer 5.8-inch display and the interior 7.6-inch flexible interior screen.\u201d On top of that, Google\u2019s architecture helped address what Hwang calls fold geometry, which describes how the screen actually bends inside the hinge. \u201cThe hinge allows us to furl the display inwards, which lets the fold extend into that area to further drive down thinness,\u201d she added. And while I\u2019ve only used the Pixel Fold briefly so far, the result is rather spectacular, with Google able to make a phone that folds completely flat while still measuring less than 6mm thick (or just 12.1mm when closed).</p><p>Steps forward like Pixel Fold\u2019s hinge and thinness don\u2019t come without trade-offs. But, while its bezels are somewhat larger than Samsung\u2019s, to Hwang it\u2019s worth it. \u201cThe bezel gave us the opportunity to have an unadulterated display without the need for an under-display camera, which we thought was really cool.\u201d It also gave Google more leeway to improve the Pixel Fold\u2019s general durability, which includes an IPX8 rating for water resistance. \u201cPlus, there\u2019s the ergonomics of it, with the larger display bezels offering a resting area for your hands,\u201d she said</p><figure><img alt=\"Even though the Pixel Fold weighs a tiny bit more than the Galaxy Z Fold 4, it's sleeker and wider dimensions mean it doesn't feel as dense. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/02e29cb0-eef4-11ed-89ff-a5ecf71b593e\" style=\"height: 1200px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption>While it might not sound like a big deal, the Pixel Fold's (right) thinner design and lack of a gap between its screen when closed go a long way towards making it easy to use. </figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Hwang said dealing with the inevitable crease in the Pixel Fold\u2019s display was another balancing act, one that he still thinks about on a regular basis. \u201cIt\u2019s unappealing, but the bigger question is how do we mitigate the crease? How do we minimize it?\u201d Eventually, what Google decided on was a hybrid approach that produces a fold that\u2019s more of a miniature water drop that runs the length of the screen instead of a full crease, which reduces its appearance while also preventing unsightly trenches from forming over time.</p><p>Still, as impressive as the Pixel Fold\u2019s design is, after talking to Google product managers, I feel like it has an even more important job serving as an ambassador for future foldables and as a flagbearer for forward-thinking software features in Android alongside newly optimized apps. That\u2019s because in addition to the device itself, the Pixel Fold is also ushering a fresh set of resources to help app makers optimize their work. Zvinakis said, \u201cthe key ways we do that are through developer guidelines, developer tooling and easy-to-use libraries.\u201d These things dictate support for features like adaptive resolutions, landscape orientation, multitasking behavior and more. There are even separate tiers denoting how much a developer has done to support foldable-friendly features along with sample configurations available in the Android Studio emulation environment. \u201cWe're about to launch physical device streaming for these Google devices in Android studio, which basically means that developers can see how their apps run on Google-hosted Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet devices, but right from your IDE (integrated developer environment). We just want to make it really easy for developers to test on these new products.\u201c</p><figure><img alt=\"The Pixel Fold features a 5x telephoto zoom just like you get on the Pixel 7 Pro. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/02e2c3c1-eef4-11ed-b568-af03fce49730\" style=\"height: 1200px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption>Unlike the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 which features a shorter zoom than on the S22 Ultra, the Pixel Fold features the same camera system including a 5x optical zoom just like you get on the Pixel 7 Pro. </figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>To make sure these apps are easier for users to find, Zvinakis says Google will begin showcasing \u201creally high-quality apps more prominently in the Play Store, including screenshots that show new foldable-specific features.\u201d And all of this is coming with a slate of more than 50 first-party Google apps that have been optimized for foldables, something that both Hwang and Zvinakis said was no easy feat. In this way, the Pixel Fold not only serves as a testbed for future devices, but also for Google\u2019s evolving software design.</p><p>Unfortunately, the team behind the Pixel Fold hasn\u2019t been able to overcome every hurdle that might prevent someone from hopping on the flexible phone trend \u2014 particularly its $1,800 price). But even with the Fold serving as the company\u2019s first go at the category, it\u2019s clear Google is bringing a ton of new ideas to the space, both in terms of hardware and software. It\u2019s slim, it\u2019s sleek and, unlike the Z Fold 4, the Pixel Fold delivers the same great camera experience that you get on the Pixel 7 Pro. It remains to be seen how well it will sell but, with Samsung\u2019s Z Fold basically treading water the past couple years, the Pixel Fold\u2019s arrival couldn\u2019t come at a better time.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/googles-designers-on-why-the-pixel-fold-isnt-just-another-foldable-153058971.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/googles-designers-on-why-the-pixel-fold-isnt-just-another-foldable-153058971.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-16 15:30:58+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Meta's Voicebox AI is a Dall-E for text-to-speech", "description": "<p>Today, we are one step closer to the immortal celebrity future we have long been promised (<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/immortal-hologram-celebrities-chatgpt-ai-deep-fake-back-catalogs-180030493.html\">since April</a>). Meta has unveiled Voicebox, its generative text-to-speech model that promises to do for the spoken word what ChatGPT and Dall-E, respectfully, did for text and image generation.&nbsp;</p><p>Essentially, its a text-to-output generator just like GPT or Dall-E \u2014 just instead of creating prose or pretty pictures, it spits out audio clips. Meta defines the system as \u201ca non-autoregressive flow-matching model trained to infill speech, given audio context and text.\u201d It\u2019s been trained on more than 50,000 hours of unfiltered audio. Specifically, Meta used recorded speech and transcripts from a bunch of public domain audiobooks written in English, French, Spanish, German, Polish, and Portuguese.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>That diverse data set allows the system to generate more conversational sounding speech, regardless of the languages spoken by each party, according to the researchers. \u201cOur results show that speech recognition models trained on Voicebox-generated synthetic speech perform almost as well as models trained on real speech.\u201d What\u2019s more the computer generated speech performed with just a 1 percent error rate degradation, compared to the 45 to 70 percent drop-off seen with existing TTS models.</p><p>The system was first taught to predict  speech segments based on the segments around them as well as the passage\u2019s transcript. \u201cHaving learned to infill speech from context, the model can then apply this across speech generation tasks, including generating portions in the middle of an audio recording without having to recreate the entire input,\u201d the Meta researchers explained.</p><p>Voicebox is also reportedly capable of actively editing audio clips, eliminating noise from the speech and even replacing misspoken words. \u201cA person could identify which raw segment of the speech is corrupted by noise (like a dog barking), crop it, and instruct the model to regenerate that segment,\u201d the researchers said, much like using image-editing software to clean up photographs.</p><p>Text-to-Speech generators haver been around for a minute \u2014 they\u2019re how your parents\u2019 TomToms were able to give dodgy driving directions in Morgan Freeman\u2019s voice.

The benchmark results aren\u2019t even close as Meta\u2019s AI reportedly outperformed the current state of the art both in intelligibility (a 1.9 percent word error rate vs 5.9 percent) and \u201caudio similarity\u201d (a composite score of 0.681 to the SOA\u2019s 0.580), all while operating as much as 20 times faster that today\u2019s best TTS systems.</p><p>But don\u2019t get your celebrity navigators lined up just yet, neither the Voicebox app nor its source code is  being released to the public at this time, Meta confirmed on Friday, citing \u201cthe potential risks of misuse\u201d despite the \u201cmany exciting use cases for generative speech models.\u201d Instead, the company released a series of audio examples (see above/below) as well as a the program\u2019s initial research paper.

First up was Ubisoft, which featured <em>Star Wars Outlaws </em>and <em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em>, a trio of Assassin's Creed games, a new Crew game and a fresh Prince of Persia title. Later that day it was Capcom's turn, and they showed off <em>Exoprimal</em>, again, and offered an intriguing look at <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em>, which looks like a unique third-person action game. Finally, because it's 2023, there was also an indefinite delay to the company's almost-forgotten AAA sci-fi game, <em>Pragmata</em>. That's a game that was announced for PlayStation 5 way back in June 2020 \u2014 before we even knew what the PS5 looked like \u2014 and this is its second delay after initially being expected in 2022.</p><p>We\u2019ll have more coverage in the coming weeks, and will update this post with links when they go live.

After a week stuffed full of gaming announcements, I feel exactly the same way. <em>\u2014 Jessica Conditt, Senior Reporter</em></p><h3><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/generative-ai-can-help-bring-tomorrows-gaming-npcs-to-life-163037183.html\">Generative AI can help bring tomorrow's gaming NPCs to life</a></h3><p>This story from senior reporter (and Engadget's AI expert) Andrew Tarantola looks at the history of NPCs from if-then programming through to finite-state-machines, decision and behavior trees, GOAPs, and modern AIs in games like <em>The Last of Us</em>, and then looks to the future to see how generative AI might impact the future of gaming.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-needs-a-reboot-164531373.html\">Ubisoft needs a reboot</a></h3><div id=\"300e744d5b4b49d3803d78789ecd2cf4\"></div><p>At some point in the last console generation, Ubisoft lost its soul. It was a piecemeal erosion process that started in 2015, and it finally resulted in a complete identity collapse somewhere between the studio\u2019s unironic rollout of in-game NFTs and its sixth delay of <em>Skull &amp; Bones</em>. Ubisoft has 40 years of AAA hits and weird licensing deals to its name, and it used to be a pillar of European innovation \u2014 but in 2023, it\u2019s selling live-service blandness, mobile ports with microtransactions and unreliable release dates. What even <em>is </em>Ubisoft anymore? <em>\u2014 Jessica Conditt</em></p><h3><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=89f68c82-f255-44fa-8db9-03fec996b93a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YouTube&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4OWY2OGM4Mi1mMjU1LTQ0ZmEtOGRiOS0wM2ZlYzk5NmI5M2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj0xaUxvZ3R3NmRLUSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZWRlOTJhNTItYTJhNC00MmUyLWI2MzktMGY3MmUwMjhhMTcwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAbg_DJNFlH6nclRvatVlZJwnlBkaK_2kWataeeUrwAAj&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D1iLogtw6dKQ\">The Starfield direct has me excited for Bethesda's new ambitious RPG</a></h3><div id=\"4ff37f7cd1004082a36bd205c3482ca5\"></div><p>Senior video producer Brandon Quintana shot this video immediately after Microsoft's Starfield Direct on Sunday, outlining why, after a fuller look at the game, he's more excited than ever for Bethesda's new ambitious RPG.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/why-the-oxenfree-ii-team-became-netflixs-first-game-studio-130035607.html\">Why the 'Oxenfree II' team became Netflix's first game studio</a></h3><p>In early 2021, Night School was in the market for a partnership.

Now, developer FromSoftware, flying high from <em>Elden Ring</em> and <em>Dark Souls</em> glory, is returning to mechs, with what it says is a remastered, reimagined take on robot combat. It\u2019s time for a mech gaming boom. <em>\u2013 Mat Smith, UK Bureau Chief</em></p><h3><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cocoon-is-worth-getting-excited-about-181529189.html\">\u2018Cocoon\u2019 is worth getting excited about</a></h3><p>Cocoon is a game that makes perfect sense while you're playing it. That would be an unremarkable achievement if it wasn't also a game that forces you to use its levels to solve themselves. It\u2019s the debut title from Geometric Interactive, a studio from folks that previously worked on the award-winning puzzle platformers <em>Limbo</em> and <em>Inside</em>. At Summer Game Fest 2023 I had around half an hour to play through the game\u2019s opening, and it has stuck with me more than anything else I saw at the show. In my mind it\u2019s the game of the show. <em>\u2013 Aaron Souppouris, Executive Editor</em></p><h3><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/forza-motorsport-wants-you-to-drive-forever-183033371.html\">'Forza Motorsport' wants you to drive forever</a></h3><p>The long-overdue next title in the Motorsport series (it\u2019s been over five years since the last!) has a bunch of new features, improved physics, better AI and looks absolutely fantastic at 4K/60. The most interesting thing about it to me is that it could well be the last distinct Motorsport game, as Microsoft is moving the series to a game-as-a-service model. In the age of Game Pass, that makes perfect sense to me, and I can\u2019t wait to start driving this October. <em>\u2013 Aaron Souppouris</em></p><h3><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/immortals-of-aveum-first-look-a-little-more-magic-and-this-might-be-wonderful-133034089.html\">'Immortals of Aveum' first look: A little more magic and this might be wonderful</a></h3><div id=\"6c48bfbc91e24177bb8d3e575fec4b8c\"></div><p>When I saw the announcement trailer for <em>Immortals of Aveum</em> in the winter of 2022, I was surprised by my own interest in the game. Today, I remain interested in <em>Immortals of Aveum </em>and I think I\u2019ve figured out why. There aren\u2019t a ton of first-person action games that rely on mechanics other than guns \u2014 <em>Dishonored</em>, <em>Ghostwire: Tokyo</em> and <em>Hexen</em> come to mind, but it\u2019s a small field overall. That might be one reason <em>Immortals</em> stands out as something fresh, but it\u2019s also nice to see a new, AAA-level game that\u2019s single-player and narrative-driven with a contained campaign, rather than an open world of live-service features. <em>\u2013 Jessica Conditt</em></p><h3><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/lysfanga-hands-on-impressions-sgf-2023-130004741.html\">\u2018Lysfanga\u2019 is what happens when hack-and-slash meets tactical time travel</a></h3><p><em>Lysfanga</em>\u2019s isometric views may conjure up memories of Hades, but this is a different kind of game. While you\u2019ll still be slicing and dicing monsters and enemies, protagonist Im\u00eb combines her spells and weapon combos with the ability to revert time and do it all over again, differently. The second time around, her shadow from the previous timeline will continue to rush into the enemies. While some action-game prowess helps, you\u2019ll only beat most levels by thinking them through before you act. The controls and play style aren\u2019t remotely similar, but Lysfanga reminded me of old Fire Emblem games, where careful planning decided a fight before it even begins. Even in this early demo, the game offers some incredibly satisfying moments when all your attacking clones come together to wipe out all the enemies in mere seconds. <em>\u2013 Mat Smith</em></p><h3><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mortal-kombat-1-first-impressions-sgf-2023-180039676.html\">\u2018Mortal Kombat 1\u2019 made a great first impression</a></h3><div id=\"7b2a0e6373eb4621ad114286e0e01025\"></div><p>Ed Boon's on-stage gameplay reveal of <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>, the latest entry in the storied fighting game franchise, was one of the stand-out moments of an otherwise subdued opening event. At a private event after the show, Brandon Quintana and Mat Smith sat down to play some <em>MK1</em> and came away impressed.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-is-a-metroidvania-style-platformer-coming-in-2024-194059046.html\">'Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown' is a Metroidvania-style platformer coming in 2024</a></h3><div id=\"00ff766809f0411fabe27a4d60bcb5a1\"></div><p>After a small reveal at Summer Game Fest\u2019s opening night event, Ubisoft did a deeper dive into the game during Monday\u2019s \u201cForward\u201d stream. After that, senior video producer Brandon Quintana got his hands on an early build of the game and had a blast.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/33-immortals-first-look-defying-a-god-is-more-fun-with-friends-190037208.html\">'33 Immortals' first look: Defying a god is more fun with friends</a></h3><p>Can you imagine assembling 33 players for a 25-minute raid? <em>33 Immortals</em> plans to do exactly that. Channeling the animation style of retro cartoons (and a little Banner Saga), <em>33 Immortals</em> is a multiplayer roguelike top-down action game from the creators of <em>Spiritfarer</em>. In this early build of the game I played with five others and had a lot of fun, even if some technical issues spoiled the party a little. I\u2019m excited to play a roguelike as part of a mob, and I'm curious to see what the other character types will be. <em>\u2013 Mat Smith</em></p><h3><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/under-the-waves-is-a-sad-but-relaxing-oceanic-adventure-130037105.html\">\u2018Under the Waves\u2019 is a sad but relaxing oceanic adventure</a></h3><p>Parallel Studio\u2019s <em>Under the Waves </em>is a calming game. Between the cheers and jeers from <em>Crash Team Rumble</em> players (possibly employees) nearby, I was diving. Diving deeper and deeper into the inky blue, chasing a jettisoned shipping container as it bounced off rocks, spilling soft toys and revealing a mysteriously abandoned submarine hidden deeper still. While I might have been relaxed, I also felt a little unsettled. In a lot of ways, whether it\u2019s the story yet to be revealed or the uneasy tension that is touched on regularly, it reminds me of <em>Firewatch</em>, even if it\u2019s all set undersea. <em>\u2013

Netflix's first game studio", "description": "<p>In early 2021, Night School was in the market for a partnership. The studio\u2019s debut game, <em>Oxenfree</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>was a breakout success in 2016, and it was followed by <em>Afterparty</em> in 2019 and then 2020\u2019s<em> Next Stop Nowhere</em>, an Apple Arcade exclusive. By 2021, co-founders Sean Krankel and Adam Hines had made deals with the major players in the industry \u2013 Xbox, PlayStation, Valve, Nintendo, Apple \u2013 and Night School was an acclaimed indie team.</p><p>\u201cWe were actually talking to Netflix about just bringing some of our existing games over,\u201d Night School co-founder Sean Krankel said at Summer Game Fest, sitting with co-founder Adam Hines and lead developer Bryant Cannon around a small table behind the demo hall.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Krankel said Night School wasn\u2019t in danger of collapsing or laying off any staff in 2021. He and Hines had about 20 employees, they were still dealing with the effects of the pandemic, and they were interested in establishing real stability at the studio. Maybe they\u2019d even find a buyer. They were casually talking with Netflix employee Bill Holmes \u2013 whom Krankel described as \u201cthe reason why there's a Netflix button on our TV remotes\u201d \u2013 about potential publishing deals, nothing more.</p><p>\u201cIt's like another normal conversation with any first party,\u201d Krankel said. \u201cAnd then, one day, he literally says, \u2018Would you ever be interested in joining?\u2019 And I'm like, <em>hummina hummina </em>\u2013 yes. Totally.\u201d</p><figure><img alt=\"Night School Studio\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/55cbdca0-0bd4-11ee-aff5-d4311c4cea80\" style=\"height: 1536px; width: 2048px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Night School Studio (Twitter)</div></figure><p>Night School was the first video game team that Netflix purchased outright, and the deal was announced on September 28th, 2021. This was just two months after Netflix revealed it had hired former EA executive Mike Verdu to lead the company\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/netflix-video-games-expansion-045850254.html\">formal push</a> into video game publishing and development, with plans to offer titles to subscribers on its streaming platform. Netflix had been messing around with games since 2017, offering mobile experiences and interactive streams based on popular shows like <em>Stranger Things</em> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-23-netflix-video-games-dark-crystal-tactics-stranger-things-gamescom.html\"><em>The Dark Crystal</em></a>.</p><p>Netflix\u2019s first experiment in video games was <em>Stranger Things</em>, a mobile title that landed in October 2017, developed by Texas studio BonusXP. It was well-received and Netflix and BonusXP went on to release a follow-up, <em>Stranger Things 3: The Game</em>, alongside the premiere of the show\u2019s third season in 2019.</p><p>If it feels like there was a weird gap between these releases, that\u2019s because there was \u2013 but not in the way you might think. Throughout 2018, Telltale Games was building an episodic narrative adventure (as it generally did) based on Stranger Things, signalling the start of a broader partnership with Netflix. At the same time, Telltale tapped Night School to create a companion mobile game set in the world above The Upside Down. Telltale and Night School had collaborated before on the 2016<em> Mr. Robot</em> mobile title, <em>Mr. Robot:1.51exfiltrati0n</em>.</p><p>As reported by <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18510849/stranger-things-secret-games-telltale-studio-closed\"><em>The Verge</em></a>, Night School began work in January 2018 on a first-person narrative adventure that would feed directly into the wider-platform game, and Krankel and Hines hired four new people for the project. Telltale missed a number of milestone payments to Night School and was generally difficult to communicate with, according to studio members who spoke with <em>The Verge</em>. And then, in September 2018, Telltale <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-21-telltale-games-layoffs-the-walking-dead.html\">effectively shut down</a>. Night School was left floating for a while, until it was clear their game was dead, too. There\u2019s been a Netflix-shaped ghost in Night School\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 ever since.</p><p>By 2021, Krankel and Hines had seen the best and worst of what publishers had to offer, and Netflix was finally ready to admit its video game ambitions. The Night School team had considered acquisition offers from other companies over the previous few years, but \u201cthere was always something off,\u201d Krankel said.</p><p>\u201cAfter the first chat that I had with the executive team [at Netflix] about this next thing, it was so exciting, because they didn't ask me, you know, \u2018Are you in the red on this?\u2019 Or, \u2018What's going on with that?\u2019 It was more like, \u2018What can we do to unblock your team from making your dreams?\u2019\u201d</p><p>Hines added, \u201cOur big concern was the autonomy aspect. We\u2019ve all worked at bigger studios before, and have just seen and felt how long it would take to get decisions made, how the creative would kind of get choked out of things because there's too many cooks in the kitchen. But just talking to Netflix a lot before we joined up, we felt really at ease, just like we were talking the same language about how to make games.\u201d</p><div id=\"1634666ee2c64a9baf80ce57164c9fe1\"></div><p>Night School\u2019s latest project is <em>Oxenfree II</em>, a hotly anticipated sequel coming to PlayStation 4, PS5, Steam, Switch and mobile devices via Netflix on July 12th. (There\u2019s no drama behind the Xbox exclusion, Krankel said: \u201cNothing happened honestly; it is just where we are in our development.\u201d)</p><p>Night School has expanded its team size and moved into the Netflix offices, and they\u2019re able to fly remote employees in as often as they need. One obvious benefit of the Netflix partnership in <em>Oxenfree II</em> is its inclusion of 32 languages at launch.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s crazy,\u201d Hines said at Summer Game Fest.</p><p>Lead developer Bryant Cannon agreed: \u201cEspecially for a game with hundreds of thousands of words in it. All that's really exciting. I think the game is going to be better because we have this battery in our back.\u201d</p><p>Night School was the first purchase in September 2021, but Netflix today owns six video game studios, including <em>Alphabear </em>developer Spry Fox and two internal teams in California and Finland. Netflix has plans to expand into <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/halo-veteran-joseph-staten-is-making-a-aaa-game-for-netflix-173502368.html\">AAA development</a> and past mobile platforms; it offers more than 50 games in its library right now, and the company plans to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/netflix-plans-to-add-roughly-40-more-titles-to-its-mobile-game-library-this-year-140014333.html\">add 40 more</a> by the end of 2023.</p><p>Netflix is publishing more games than it\u2019s buying outright, including <em>Spiritifarer</em>, <em>Into the Breach</em>, <em>Poinpy</em> and <em>Kentucky Route Zero</em>. One of the biggest names in its pile is <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/layas-horizon-a-sandbox-wingsuit-game-from-the-studio-behind-altos-odyssey-arrives-may-2nd-150033749.html\"><em>Laya\u2019s Horizon</em></a>, the latest title from <em>Alto\u2019s Adventure</em> and <em>Alto\u2019s Odyssey</em> studio, Snowman. <em>Laya\u2019s Horizon</em> is a serene wingsuit game set in a sprawling mountainside sandbox, and it\u2019s exclusive to Netflix Games on Android and iOS.</p><figure><img alt=\"Laya's Horizon title screen.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/45cb28b0-e442-11ed-88f9-fabdbfd890d0\" style=\"height: 1215px; width: 2160px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Snowman</div></figure><p>Snowman got its start publishing the iOS versions of the Team Alto games in 2015 and 2018, followed by the Apple Arcade timed exclusives <em>Skate City</em> and <em>Where Cards Fall</em>. Snowman developed and released <em>Lucky Luna</em> for Netflix in 2022, followed by <em>Laya\u2019s Horizon</em> this May. Snowman\u2019s games tend to end up on multiple platforms, eventually, but Android has generally been <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-17-altos-odyssey-android-release-date-free-ios-interview.html\">an afterthought</a>. Its last two projects landed on Android and iOS simultaneously because of Netflix.</p><p>In April, Snowman founder Ryan Cash told Engadget that the Netflix partnership hadn\u2019t been a barrier for players. Yes, you need a Netflix account to play the games. But:</p><p>\u201cEveryone I've had this conversation with has Netflix,\u201d Cash said. \u201cSo they just get to playing right away. Whereas before, it was either, I have to sell them a $5 game or I have to tell them, OK, it's free to play, there are ads but you can remove them if you want. Or it's like, you gotta sign up for Apple Arcade, or you need an Xbox or whatever it is. So it's been the most barrier-free way to tell people what I do.\u201d</p><p><em>Laya\u2019s Horizon</em> doesn\u2019t have a currency system, microtransactions, pop-ups or billboards advertising real-life products lining the slopes of its virtual mountain \u2013 because Snowman doesn\u2019t need these features for the game to be adequately profitable. The Netflix partnership took care of that aspect, and creative director Jason Medeiros didn\u2019t have to implement monetization in the actual game.</p><p>\u201cI didn't want any of that stuff,\u201d Medeiros said. \u201cBecause I mean, I liked games before all that stuff happened. So having a platform like Netflix, it's just like, none of that matters. Like, you don't have to do that stuff. It's a breath of fresh air; we jump on opportunities to make games that way.\u201d</p><p>When I initially asked the Night School crew why they chose to be bought by Netflix, Krankel immediately got to the heart of the matter and volleyed, \u201cWhy not remain independent?\u201d And then he answered his question:</p><p>\u201cA small subset of teams are good to go for the next 10 years, but others have these peaks and valleys, and we were somewhere in between. We weren't in danger of anything going sideways. But we were at a spot where we're like, it would be cool to tether to somebody who has a similar vision, and somebody that we could work with that would like, de-risk us.\u201d</p><p>Signing up to be acquired by a massive media company comes with its own risks, but they\u2019re different concerns than those of a fully independent operation, which has to manage funding and paying salaries without a safety net. The challenge for indie studios is to sign up with a parent company that can strike a healthy balance between support and autonomy, and Netflix has a proven track record in this space when it comes to film and television. Games are just the next frontier when it comes to streaming entertainment.</p><p><em>Catch up on all of the news from Summer Game Fest </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/sgf-2023\"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/why-the-oxenfree-ii-team-became-netflixs-first-game-studio-130035607.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/why-the-oxenfree-ii-team-became-netflixs-first-game-studio-130035607.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-16 13:00:35+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Engadget Podcast: Reddit\u2019s revolt, MacBook Air 15 and Mac Studio reviews", "description": "<p>What good is Reddit without the support of its community?

These include the massively popular r/funny, which has more than 40 million subscribers, as well as r/aww, r/Music and others with tens of millions of subscribers. Many of these subreddits\u2019 moderators say they plan to continue their protests <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/popular-subreddits-plan-to-extend-blackouts-indefinitely-205005565.html\"><ins>indefinitely</ins></a>.</p><p>In the short term, massive Reddit communities going dark doesn\u2019t just affect Redditors. It also has an outsize impact on <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/14/reddit-blackout-google-search-results/\"><ins>search results</ins></a> because so many people rely on the collective advice, conversations and shared knowledge of the discussions that <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-search-reddit-forums-180047845.html\"><ins>are central</ins></a> to the platform. As many have pointed out, one of the biggest immediate impacts of the blackout was not a vastly different front page, but <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2023/06/14/popular-google-search-hack-doesnt-work-reddit-protests/\"><ins>search results</ins></a> that lead to dead ends rather than answers.</p><p>But there are other, longer term effects we\u2019re only just beginning to get a hint of. For one, the blackout could lead to significant changes in Reddit\u2019s own policies and its dealings with moderators. In <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/reddit-protest-blackout-ceo-steve-huffman-moderators-rcna89544\"><ins>an interview</ins></a> with <em>NBC News</em>, Huffman suggested he was considering changing the site\u2019s rules to make it easier to remove moderators.</p><p>From NBC:</p><blockquote><p>Huffman, also a Reddit co-founder, said he plans to pursue changes to Reddit\u2019s moderator removal policy to allow ordinary users to vote moderators out more easily if their decisions aren\u2019t popular. He said the new system would be more democratic and allow a wider set of people to hold moderators accountable.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>One change that is \u201creally important,\u201d he said, \u201cis making sure that, for example, the protests, now or in the future, are actually representative of their communities. And I think that may have been the case for many at the beginning of this week, but that\u2019s less and less the case as time goes on.</p></blockquote><p>A post from Reddit admins also alluded to such a change. In <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/14a5lz5/comment/jo9wdol/\"><ins>response</ins></a> to a question on r/ModSuport, a company representative raised a similar point. \u201cActive communities are relied upon by thousands or even millions of users, and we have a duty to keep these spaces active,\u201d the unnamed employee wrote. \u201cIf a moderator team unanimously decides to stop moderating, we will invite new, active moderators to keep these spaces open and accessible to users. If there is no consensus, but at least one mod who wants to keep the community going, we will respect their decisions and remove those who no longer want to moderate from the mod team.\u201d</p><p>While the post cited Reddit\u2019s existing policies for moderators, the comment has been interpreted by some longtime moderators as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1669464567074680835\"><ins>a direct threat</ins></a>. For now, it\u2019s unclear exactly how Reddit\u2019s policies may change for its legions of volunteer moderators. The company didn\u2019t immediately respond to questions about whether it plans to change its moderator removal policy. But at the very least, it seems that Reddit is at least interested in shifting the power dynamics that have historically given its unpaid moderators an outsize influence over the platform</p><p>Meanwhile, the blackout has affected Reddit in other important ways. There\u2019s been a small, but growing push among some power users to federated Reddit alternatives like <a href=\"https://lemmy.ml/\"><ins>Lemmy</ins></a> and <a href=\"https://kbin.social/\"><ins>kbin</ins></a>. These decentralized platforms are still niche, and have many of the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-alternatives-mastodon-223221883.html\"><ins>same challenges</ins></a> as Mastodon and other Twitter alternatives. Yet there seems to be growing interest from some corners of Reddit in recent weeks. Other large communities are simply moving to a more familiar platform: <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reddit-blackout-discord-chat-app-poised-pick-up-slack-2023-6\"><ins>Discord</ins></a>.</p><p>And, as much as Reddit\u2019s leadership tries to downplay the impact of the blackout, advertisers <a href=\"https://digiday.com/marketing/reddits-recent-blackout-could-be-a-real-problem-for-advertisers/\"><ins>have noticed</ins></a>. According to <a href=\"https://www.adweek.com/social-marketing/ripples-through-reddit-as-advertisers-weather-moderators-strike/\"><em><ins>AdWeek</ins></em></a>, some ad buyers have at least temporarily paused advertising while they wait for the blackout to play out. And while Huffman has suggested that the company\u2019s ad revenue hasn\u2019t taken a significant hit from the protest, that could change if it drags on indefinitely in communities advertisers are particularly interested in reaching. \u201c[Advertisers] didn\u2019t want to become the subject of users\u2019 opinions about Reddit\u2019s decisions,\u201d one unnamed ad buyer told the publication.</p><p>All of this could ultimately leave Reddit in a much different place than it was before the blackout. As Rory Mir,  the associate director of community organizing for digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation, <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/06/what-reddit-got-wrong\"><ins>recently wrote</ins></a>, Reddit seems to be following a familiar pattern. \u201cWhat we see time and time again, though, is that when a platform turns its back on the community, it doesn\u2019t end well,\u201d Mir said. \u201cThey\u2019ll revolt and they\u2019ll flee, and the platform will be left trying to squeeze dwindling profits from a colossal wreck.\u201d</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-reddit-blackout-is-already-forcing-unexpected-changes-103521266.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/the-reddit-blackout-is-already-forcing-unexpected-changes-103521266.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-16 10:35:21+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Forza maker Turn 10 teams with Hutch on a 'car customization' mobile game", "description": "<p>The developer of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/forza-motorsport-wants-you-to-drive-forever-183033371.html\"><em>Forza Motorsport</em></a>, Turn 10, is teaming with <a href=\"https://www.hutch.io/our-games/f1-clash/\"><em>F1 Clash</em></a>'s Hutch on a new mobile game.

Some of the documents he shared with the public had markings to show that they had the most highly restricted classification and could only be viewed inside a protected facility.&nbsp;</p><p>Previous reports said Texeira didn't intend to become a whistleblower and only started sharing documents to impress his gaming friends. He started by copying sensitive information by hand, since he worked at a facility that prohibited cameras and phones, but was eventually able to post photos of original documents.

The Justice Department's national security division also argued for his indefinite detention, because he could still be in possession of information that would be \"tremendous value to hostile nation-states.\" In addition, the Justice Department has revealed that Air Force officials failed to remove Texeira from his job and to take appropriate action after catching him copying sensitive details and actively looking for classified information months before he was arrested.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/air-national-guardsman-accused-of-leaking-classified-documents-has-been-indicted-063800341.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/air-national-guardsman-accused-of-leaking-classified-documents-has-been-indicted-063800341.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-16 06:38:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
