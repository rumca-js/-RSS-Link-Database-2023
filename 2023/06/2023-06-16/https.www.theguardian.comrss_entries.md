<p>The actor, 74, on clarity, claustrophobia and CBE catastrophes</p><p><strong>I was grateful</strong> <strong>that Gareth,</strong> my character in <em>Four Weddings </em><em>and a </em><em>Funeral</em>, died of Scottish dancing. When it came out in 1994, Aids was rampant. We’d just had <em>Philadelphia</em>, an honourable film with noble intentions, but once again homosexuality was identified with disease. Disease and prison were the two ways most people thought about gay people. Gareth didn’t give a toss about any of that. He died from an excess of joy and generosity, which was a wonderful thing.</p><p><strong>Life would have been</strong> <strong>very different</strong> if I hadn’t written to Laurence Olivier. I wrote as a fan, not as somebody who ever expected to become an actor. He was artistic director of the National Theatre. I explained to him what marvellous work he was staging. He replied saying, “If you like it so much, come and work in the box office.” It proved a great vantage point. I had lunch in the canteen daily with “youngbloods” like Derek Jacobi and Michael Gambon. I started to think maybe I could do this, too.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/17/simon-callow-coming-out-was-my-biggest-act-of-activism">Continue reading...</a>

And that she was charged with attempted murder after stabbing him (maybe check Titchener’s medical history?), then gave birth to their son Jack in a mother-and-baby unit while on remand. At her trial, she was found to have acted in self-defence, but then Rob tried, and failed, to abduct Jack – or Gideon, as he calls him – before we all hoped we had seen the last of him.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/16/the-archers-bbc-radio-4-interview-rob-helen-titchener-timothy-watson-louiza-patikas">Continue reading...</a>

Some of the fans here bought tickets for this match nine months back, and have been waiting for it through the autumn, winter, and spring. Now it’s almost here, and the atmosphere in the final seconds is eager, and apprehensive. All eyes are on the middle, and the volume in the Hollies Stand has dropped to a murmur. Nobody knows what’s going to happen, but everybody’s excited that we’re finally about to find out.</p><p>This year’s Ashes has felt especially unpredictable, the Australians have clearly had no real idea what to expect from this England team, and it isn’t all that much more obvious even to their own supporters. Nobody knows how their easy-come, easy-go approach will hold up against an Australian squad that includes the world’s three top-ranked Test batsmen, four fine fast bowlers, and the most prolific finger-spinner in history. Anyone who says otherwise is lying. Nobody really knows anything, except that it will be entertaining.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/16/zak-crawley-sets-frenzied-tone-for-ashes-with-brilliant-first-ball-blast">Continue reading...</a>

The loss of such a unique and monumental artistic force is one thing, and the loss of such a special friend is another.</p><p>We first connected via a phone call one week out from shooting The Road.

<p>Readers debate whether a mother who had an abortion beyond the legal limit of 24 weeks should have been sent to prison</p><p>I am pro-choice. It is essential for women to have access to safe and legal abortion in the early stages of pregnancy. However, despite the indignant response to this tragic case (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/13/scrap-unjust-verdict-woman-prison-abortion" title="">Scrap this unjust verdict, scrap this law: no woman should go to prison for having an abortion, theguardian.com, 13 June</a>), I am yet to understand how women’s access to legal abortion is threatened by punishment for this person, who lied to procure an illegal late‑term abortion.</p><p>Late-term abortion, other than for medical reasons, puts the mother at risk and is a grotesque misuse of the procedure. The time limit for legal abortion is not a minor detail, but incredibly important. Nerve formation, brain function and maturation of the organs progress with time, turning an embryo into a being able to live independently of its mother – a person, in other words. How can we provide every resource to save premature babies born at 26 weeks but allow free access to late-term abortion?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/16/tangled-ethical-issues-in-a-tragic-abortion-case">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The first author to win the Women’s prize for fiction twice on how Charles Dickens – and rage about the opioid crisis - helped her write ‘the great Appalachian novel’</p><p>‘Guilty!” American novelist Barbara Kingsolver says when I ask how she feels to become the first writer to win the Women’s prize for fiction twice. “Guilty and delighted,” she says over coffee in a London hotel, the morning after winning the prize for her tenth novel Demon Copperhead. “I don’t want to be greedy. I don’t want to take something that would be more helpful to someone else. It’s my upbringing, I was raised in a culture of modesty.”</p><p>With a Susan-Sontag silver streak in her hair and steely good humour, 68-year-old Kingsolver is a quiet titan of American literature. Best-known for her mega-selling 1998 novel The Poisonwood Bible and The Lacuna, which won the Women’s (then Orange) prize in 2010, she has taken on uncomfortable subjects such as American colonialism and climate change. She counts Hillary Clinton as a friend and was invited to lunch at the White House with Barack Obama – “One of the most magnetically attractive human beings” – who quizzed her for writing tips. And yet, she rarely leaves the farm in the mountains of south-west Virginia, where she lives with her husband. When she is not writing, she turns her hand to delivering breach lambs. “I’ve done things that risk my wedding band, I’ll just put it like that,” she says, laughing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/16/barbara-kingsolver-rural-people-are-so-angry-they-want-to-blow-up-the-system">Continue reading...</a>

Sign up now!</a></p><p>Gareth Southgate has previously played down comparisons between Jack Grealish and Paul Gascoigne. It was increasingly difficult to avoid drawing one in the past week, though, as Manchester City tucked into a few drinks to celebrate their Champions League final success against Internazionale, a result that completed a trophy treble. Grealish, a skilful playmaker like Gascoigne, was exceptionally well-lubricated in the aftermath of that nervy 1-0 win in Istanbul. As he stumbled around between planes, trams and open-top bus parades, it evoked memories of some of the most “legendary” Gascoigne moments; visions of the great man sporting a pair of fake plastic breasts or burping into a microphone, all the while leaving the likes of his Lazio clubmate, Aaron Winter, astonished by his booze-fuelled routine.<br /><br />When he was England manager, Graham Taylor once remarked that Gascoigne might do well to look at how he “refuelled” himself. And the abundantly talented Gascoigne’s drinking ultimately led him to a public battle with addiction (as well as, arguably, some of the injuries that hampered his career). That’s not to say Grealish is the same as Gascoigne, of course, or indeed that his career is heading in a similar direction. But as Southgate correctly said, there is a line.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/16/england-jack-grealish-gareth-southgate">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In a fascinating new documentary, an Australian trans man gains unprecedented access to the terrorist organisation while keeping his identity secret</p><p>In 2021, Jordan Bryon took major steps to physically realize his identity as a transgender man, opposed by a society that often looked upon him with hostility and a government that neither understood nor respected him. As he started hormone injections in preparation for gender-affirming surgery, he soon found himself embroiled in a political firestorm over his basic right to exist. His precarious position has grown all too familiar as barbaric anti-trans laws spring up around the United States like invasive weeds, but Bryon isn’t American. He hails from a small town in Australia, and he undertook the sensitive, undeniable work of transitioning while working as a journalist in Afghanistan just as the Taliban – a group not known for their policies of tolerance – seized control of the country.</p><p>“[I was] making this transition without any idea of where it was going, or how to plan for it,” Bryon tells the Guardian over Zoom. “And yeah, it was just too hard, doing it myself. I couldn’t continue living and doing all the shooting at the same time, and <em>then</em>, the Taliban took over. I gave up and stopped, then these guys convinced me to keep going.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/16/tranisition-documentary-taliban-afghanistan">Continue reading...</a>

I usually go for vanilla, but it’s also fab with pistachio or a good-quality chocolate.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/16/coconut-cherry-ice-cream-sandwiches-recipe-benjamina-ebuehi">Continue reading...</a>

After the trivial first half of Settle Down, Whitehall promises substantial comedy after the interval. But that substance is endlessly deferred, until the self-described “foppish man-child” pivots, re-branding Settle Down as his last inconsequential show before parenthood and enforced maturity descends.</p><p>We’ll see. I don’t hold my breath for the grownup version of this perennial kidult – Whitehall is very wedded to the comedy of “I’m a massive melt!” But there are signs that the 34-year-old is at least trying to express a meaningful opinion or reveal something of his actual self. Is his failure to do so a matter of artistic ability, or pathology? Repeatedly tonight he cites his horror of therapy, of ever being made to express his feelings – which may be why his comedy comes across as so inauthentic. But that’s also an artistic issue: Whitehall’s routines often feel basic, their subject matter secondhand, their formulas predictable.</p><p><a href="https://www.jackwhitehall.com/">Touring until 21 August</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/16/jack-whitehall-review-settling-down">Continue reading...</a>

Over the past decade, the splashy hit show has become notorious for its profound, satirical commentary on the frightening repercussions of imaginary (though often startlingly prophetic) technological advances. “Watching Black Mirror has really encouraged me to put my phone down,” Paul says, before apologising again. “I haven’t owned a computer in over 12 years. I never look at my email.

Both rugby codes have disclosed their intent to lower the legal tackle height in the years ahead; some feel it is a reactive move to the growing number of players taking legal action against the sport they played, others feel it is simply a progressive step to protecting the players better. But whatever the reason, this is league’s first step into a new era of contact sport, with a six-week trial across four rounds of academy fixtures where only tackles below the armpit are legal, lowered from below the shoulder.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/16/rugby-league-tackle-height-trial-concussion">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The lurid giant of Italian populism’s career grew out of his media empire, which heralded post-ideological society with a consumerist dreamworld</p><p>Silvio Berlusconi was, in more ways than one, the televisual prophet of the neoliberal age. Though he officially entered politics only in 1994, his cultural hegemony began long before. From the early 80s, Berlusconi ruled Italy by means of entertainment, managing political life the same way he did his media conglomerates, translating Reaganite hedonism into Italian. His private TV channels changed the tastes of Italian audiences by bringing the action-filled dreams of American capitalism into their living rooms.</p><p>The fuel that propelled the early days of Berlusconi’s Mediaset empire was cinema, mostly American cinema. The budget for original content was limited, so pay TV filled programming schedules with films. Films that, back then, one could not see on other channels. For more than two decades, Mediaset successfully challenged the state television monopoly, thereby paving the way for the privatisation of everyday life. With the expediency of a pirate, he steered the nation away from the cinema of Fellini and Antonioni, towards the inexorable Americanisation of mass culture.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/16/berlusconi-turned-entertainment-into-politics">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Groupama Stadium, Lyon<br /></strong>With  pyrotechnics that might tire a pyromaniac and a giant blow-up Satan the Devonian stadium-fillers have lost none of their thrilling pomp</p><p>Halfway through Muse’s set, probably the daftest thing that Groupama Stadium has ever seen happens. Frontman Matt Bellamy is wearing shimmering silver while perched at a light-up piano and playing booming horror cliche Toccata and Fugue in D Minor by Bach. Then his band break into You Make Me Feel Like It’s Halloween, replete with a three-storey-tall masked, hooded face behind them, the video screen inside it alternating between Jason Voorhees, Freddy Krueger and other scary movie villains. It’s the most high-budget display of rock’n’roll camp – yet the night will get madder from here.</p><p>Outside this near-60,000 crowd, Muse aren’t necessarily the coolest band in the world any more. It was as early as 2007 that the Devon trio ascended to this grandiose level: after megahits from Supermassive Black Hole to Starlight meshed pop-rock drama with calls for revolution just vague enough that both the left and right could rally behind them, they became the first band to sell out the new Wembley Stadium. Since then though, hit-and-miss albums such as last year’s Will of the People have dented what was previously a bulletproof reputation for top-notch anthem-making.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/16/muse-review-sublimely-ridiculous-rocknroll-camp">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Journalist who has died aged 81 was an engaging writer and a last line of defence against bad grammar and simple mistakes</p><p>In journalism, there are people whose brilliance is known to every one of their departmental colleagues but not to the readers. There are people so idiosyncratic that it is hard to imagine them existing in a more conventional profession. And there are people who stay so long in the job that it becomes impossible to imagine the place without them.</p><p>Jeremy Alexander, who died of cancer aged 81 on Thursday, embodied all that in a single individual. For anyone who has ever worked on the Guardian sports desk there is not just sadness but disbelief. It is the end of an era that lasted 57 years. Repeat, 57. He worked for the department from 1966 until his final illness in March. It may even have been his first illness; he claimed never to have taken a day off sick, and his facts tended to be reliable.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/16/jeremy-alexander-died-guardian-sport-mainstay-for-57-years">Continue reading...</a>

<p>UN bans aimed at transgressive regimes always hurt the poor and innocent, leaving rulers such as Kim Jong-un unscathed</p><p>This week, the BBC has been carrying <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM8nJfehZ_g">reports</a> from the world’s most authoritarian and impenetrable state. The headline: its people are starving. Communist North Korea is destitute, even as capitalist South Korea is one of Asia’s most prosperous nations. It starved in the 1950s, 1970s and 1990s, and was rescued by China. But the government closed the border during Covid and it has barely reopened, hampering the import of Chinese foodstuff. UN experts reckon that North Korea can this year feed <a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/03/21/north-koreans-are-at-growing-risk-of-starvation">barely three-quarters</a> of its 26 million people at survival level. The BBC has spoken to people who have witnessed neighbours dying of starvation in their homes and on the streets. More than half a million perished in the 1990s famine. This could be repeated.</p><p>What should Britons do about this, beyond offering distant sympathy?

Lads yell to mates across the road, girls tug at miniskirts to just-about cover their bums. It’s a familiar booze-fuelled blur.

Not because there isn’t a bar, but because the punters have boycotted it in solidarity with staff in the midst of an employment dispute.</p><p>The water-only policy doesn’t dampen spirits.

## Selling yourself is a minefield for all of us – not just students. Here's how to do it in 600 words | Katy Guest

<p>The fine art of self-promotion is more vital than ever – and crafting a personal statement is apt training for modern life</p><p>“I didn’t have the time to write you a short letter, so I’m writing you a long one instead,” Mark Twain is supposed to have written on a postcard to his friend. Good writers have always known that distilling one’s thoughts into a limited space takes effort and skill. (Bad writers sprinkle around lots of footnotes and pretend they’re not included in the word count.) So it must be immensely frustrating to whittle your life story and all your aspirations into about 600 words, only to find that the recipient has merely skim-read them. That’s the experience of students writing a UK university application personal statement – limited to <a href="https://www.ucas.com/undergraduate/applying-university/writing-personal-statement/introducing-personal-statement-tool">4,000 characters</a> – which harassed admissions staff now only <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jun/15/uk-university-staff-only-read-students-personal-statements-for-two-minutes">spend about two minutes</a> reading.</p><p>I sympathise with the students, who are obliged to waffle on about all the hobbies they’re expected to be beavering away at while simultaneously studying for A-levels and probably holding down a part-time job. But perhaps universities are teaching them a valuable, if brutal lesson. Two minutes’ attention from a time-pressed stranger is a luxury that they will seldom enjoy in adulthood. It’s also more than enough time to read 600 words. So, if they can’t sell themselves in a short essay, how are they ever going to get anyone to open their emails, read their Tinder profiles, or pay attention to their strongly worded complaint to the British Airways<strong> </strong>customer services team? At what age is it appropriate to learn that everyone else is just <em>too busy</em> to listen to you selling yourself?</p><p>Katy Guest is a writer, reviewer and editor</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/16/selling-yourself-students-personal-statement">Continue reading...</a>

As we talk, Holbrook is visibly still attempting to process the whole thing.</p><p>“The level of stimuli was comical,” he drawls. “It was out of sight, man.

Her influences include Che Guevara and the psychiatrist and anti-colonialist Frantz Fanon, and she sometimes sports a black-and-white keffiyeh, the checkered scarf associated with Palestinian resistance.

<p>Successional sowing can keep your vegetable plot productive for longer – and avoid a glut of crops</p><p>The sound of the veg patch in June is riotous. There are marmalade hoverflies, buff-tailed bumblebees and cabbage white butterflies flitting by, eyeing up the (netted) brassica bed. After a sluggish start to the season, it finally feels as though the garden is kicking into gear.</p><p>While there are many plants that you sow once a year (tomatoes, chillies, winter squash and aubergine, to name a few) and nurture until they’re ready to be picked, there are a number of crops that you can – and should – sow more often than that. Taking a successional approach to growing – a few seeds sown every month or so – ensures that you have a regular yield of ready-to-eat crops instead of all of your harvests arriving at the same time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/16/the-crops-you-can-sow-over-and-over-to-eat-well-all-summer">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Digital Storytelling, its new exhibition, shows how interactive technology has changed – and expanded – the way we tell stories</p><p>When you walk into the British Library, the first thing you’ll see – apart from people sitting in every available free space, writing on laptops or in notebooks – is a glass tower encasing rows upon rows of books, stretching up to the ceiling. It’s fair to say that this place has a lot of experience when it comes to displaying stories. For digital, interactive stories, though, the classic glass case doesn’t really work. These tales often invite the reader to play a part in the narrative and shape their own experience, but this can be difficult when you’re standing in an exhibition room with people looking over your shoulder, waiting for their turn. Allowing for interactivity in the finite and often restrictive setting of an exhibition is not an easy task. But in its latest exhibition, Digital Storytelling, the British Library has tasked itself with just that.</p><p>It is not the first time the British Library has featured digital works: however, it is the first time that an entire exhibition has revolved around “the ways in which digital technologies have shaped how we communicate and tell stories”, as the curators put it. It features highly regarded commercial classics of interactive digital storytelling, such as the Inkle’s 2014 steampunk narrative fiction game <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/22/interactive-stories-computer-games-80-days">80 Days</a>, and Nyamnyam’s 2019 Elizabethan comedy narrative adventure <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/may/09/astrologaster-review-game-ipad-iphone-mac-pc-nyamnyam">Astrologaster</a>, sitting beside intimate personal narratives such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/apr/26/dan-hett-indie-games-designer-manchester-arena-bombing">c ya laterrrr</a>, an autobiographical hypertext account of the loss of author Dan Hett’s brother in the 2017 Manchester Arena terrorist attack. Despite the modest size of the exhibition room, the curators (Giulia Carla Rossi, Ian Cooke, and Stella Wisdom) have selected a wide range of pieces spanning genres, topics and emotions, made with a variety of digital tools.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jun/16/british-library-is-getting-into-gaming-digital-storytelling">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Soviet-born novelist on rewriting the Torah, learning from Judy Blume, and why Vladimir Nabokov is ‘yum’</p><p><strong>My earliest reading memory</strong><br />I was living in Leningrad and there was a book called <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/23/the-wonderful-adventure-of-nils-holgersson-selma-lagerlof-review-childrens-book" title="">The Wonderful Adventure of Nils Holgersson</a>, by a Swedish author, Selma Lagerlöf. It inspired me to write my first book when I was five, called Lenin and His Magical Goose, in which Lenin meets a magical Armenian goose and they invade Finland together and make it socialist.</p><p><strong>My favourite book growing up</strong><br />I really liked Tom Sawyer &amp; Huckleberry Finn. By this point I had arrived in America and had difficulty figuring out what the county was all about. That <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/marktwain" title="">Mark Twain</a> guy really explained it to me. Also, it was my first real foray into humour and I never looked back.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/16/gary-shteyngart-orwell-made-dictatorships-seem-a-lot-less-sexy">Continue reading...</a>
