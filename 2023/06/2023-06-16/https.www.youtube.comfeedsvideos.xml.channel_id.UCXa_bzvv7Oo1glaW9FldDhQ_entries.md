The medium of games has come a long way since its humble beginnings, and modern games have now found their way into the very fabric of pop culture. With the ever-changing interest of fans and the turbulent nature of the industry itself, many of the franchises that were once household names have been lost to the times.

We’re talking about franchises like Deus Ex, Mortal Kombat, and Half-Life that not only radically evolved in a gameplay sense but also from a graphical standpoint. This feature is meant as a celebration of such video game franchises, and detail 15 of the biggest graphical leaps in gaming.

There are a lot of great open-world games out there with memorable stories, excellent mechanics, a wide range of fun content, and stellar visuals. It's almost insane such worlds are possible without everything falling apart.

However, not every great open-world game has a great open world. Some are full of potential but ultimately end up under-delivering or outright wasting it. Others are fun for die-hard fans of the series or genre but still present significant problems with their design and overall approach. Then there are the awful open worlds, which make some truly terrible games with all their bugs and stagnant gameplay even worse.

Check out 15 open-world titles that wasted their potential, even when the odds seemed in their favor.

The new Layers of Fear aspires to be the definitive entry of Bloober Team’s psychological horror franchise, and while it does check the boxes it needs to to justify that moniker, it still falls short of hitting the bar of quality that it needed to to truly stand out. 

It looks absolutely stunning and it boasts impressive audio design, but in some key areas, the game stumbles in more ways than one. Its gameplay loop is far too repetitive and monotonous to be able to hold your attention for the entirety of its runtime, its storytelling is far too inconsistent and frequently ineffective, and more often than not, its scares are more predictable than they are frightening. Though Layers of Fear is not without its merits, in the end, it’s a very pretty but rather forgettable experience.
