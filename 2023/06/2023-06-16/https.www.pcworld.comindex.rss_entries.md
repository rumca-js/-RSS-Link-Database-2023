<p>Is your Western Digital My Cloud device currently offline? Don&rsquo;t worry&mdash;the company isn&rsquo;t suffering another service outage. Rather, it&rsquo;s a new measure to prevent exploits of security vulnerabilities. If you haven&rsquo;t updated your device&rsquo;s firmware recently, it&rsquo;s being barred from access to My Cloud.</p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/western-digital-boots-outdated-nas-devices-off-of-my-cloud/&amp;xcust=2-1-1957033-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Bleeping Computer</a>, Western Digital began blocking web access on June 15 if the NAS unit had not yet updated to firmware version 5.26.202 (My Cloud) or 9.4.1-101 (My Cloud Home, SanDisk ibi). The software updates were released on May 15, and include fixes for several security flaws. One is rated as critical severity. The policy change was announced in <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.westerndigital.com/support/product-security/wdc-23009-western-digital-my-cloud-os-5-my-cloud-home-and-sandisk-ibi-firmware-update&amp;xcust=2-1-1957033-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">a security bulletin earlier this week</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While dramatic, Western Digital&rsquo;s actions seem to be related to its <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1681254/western-digitals-my-cloud-goes-down-after-hack.html">service woes back in April</a>, when a hack led the company to take down its servers for over a week to complete remediation. The critical severity issue patched in its May 15 firmware allows unauthenticated code to be executed remotely on a My Cloud device&mdash;which could expose users to threats like ransomware attacks.</p>



<p>Users can still access data on offline My Cloud devices locally. Access and management of files through the web becomes available again after the outdated device completes a firmware update. Affected devices include:</p>



<ul><li>My Cloud PR2100 &ndash; requires 5.26.202 or later</li><li>My Cloud PR4100 &ndash; requires 5.26.202 or later</li><li>My Cloud EX4100 &ndash; requires 5.26.202 or later</li><li>My Cloud EX2 Ultra &ndash; requires 5.26.202 or later</li><li>My Cloud Mirror G2 &ndash; requires 5.26.202 or later</li><li>My Cloud DL2100 &ndash; requires 5.26.202 or later</li><li>My Cloud DL4100 &ndash; requires 5.26.202 or later</li><li>My Cloud EX2100 &ndash; requires 5.26.202 or later</li><li>My Cloud &ndash; requires 5.26.202 or later</li><li>WD Cloud &ndash; requires 5.26.202 or later</li><li>My Cloud Home &ndash; requires 9.4.1-101 or later</li><li>My Cloud Home Duo &ndash; requires 9.4.1-101 or later</li><li>SanDisk ibi &ndash; requires 9.4.1-101 or later</li></ul>

<p>This policy announcement closely follows <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1953639/western-digital-drives-ask-to-be-replaced-after-3-years-even-without-hardware-problems.html">recent reports about Western Digital hard drive</a> warnings, which, unlike the firmware updates mentioned above, do not address any security issues. Even without problems, some WD hard disk drives are flashing alerts after three years&mdash;and it&rsquo;s causing the drives to stop working in Synology NAS devices. Synology is currently recommending that users turn off the warnings to restore functionality.</p>

## Go play Art of Rally for a perfect mix of racing skill and chill

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>Over the last month I&rsquo;ve been playing a lot of both <em>Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom </em>and <em>Fortnite.</em> And those are both big, complicated games, with lots of little intricate systems that you have to learn to excel, like Zelda&rsquo;s insane &ldquo;stick anything to anything&rdquo; weapon and vehicle system and Fortnite&rsquo;s rotating pools of fiddly guns and movement mechanics. After finishing <em>Zelda</em>, I craved something simple and focused to help me unwind, and I found it in <em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/550320/art_of_rally/&amp;xcust=2-2-1956731-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Art of Rally</a></em>. </p>



<p>This top-down racing game from 2020 is about as simple as racing gets: Start at the starting line, finish at the finish line, and do your best to minimize the time in between them. It&rsquo;s also visually simple, eschewing both the latest bells and whistles of the Unreal engine and the trendy pixels and voxels of most recent indie games for a clean, low-poly look that emphasizes lighting and weather to give each location character. As with real rally racing, there are no other cars on the track, just you and the clock. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>But the simplicity of the setup is deceptive. <em>Art of Rally</em> is a game that&rsquo;s deeply in love with rally racing, both its straightforward mechanics and its history. In the main campaign you&rsquo;ll get a truncated tour of the history of rally&rsquo;s rise to prominence, and you&rsquo;ll unlock the cars that made that history. Unfortunately there&rsquo;s a bit of obfuscation in the names and livery of these famous cars, but fans of the sport will be able to spot the intended homages instantly, and the rest of us can probably figure it out with a little Googling. </p>



<p>The surprising depth extends to the racing itself. Despite the simplicity of the tracks, this is a racing game that absolutely demands your full attention and focus, with each car handling differently on asphalt, dirt, and snow, reacting to the rise and fall of the road with realistic physics. <em>Art of Rally</em> might not look much like AAA entries like Codemasters&rsquo; <em>Dirt </em>or <em>V-Rally</em>, but it demands just as much skill from players even if you don&rsquo;t opt for the optional manual transmission. (Hey, don&rsquo;t judge me, I can drive stick in real life.) </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Art of Rally screenshot field" class="wp-image-1956859" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ss_032d3b8d120b113e1b1cf06da250dff616226ea6.1920x1080.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Funselektor Labs</p></div>



<p>The contrast between the soothing visuals and music and the absolutely demanding gameplay is a rare one, reminding me a bit of <em>Risk of Rain 2 </em>without the multiplayer. While it presents almost like a &ldquo;chill&rdquo; game a la Unpacking, it will absolutely punish you the moment you lose focus or take the track for granted. It&rsquo;s not an impossible challenge &mdash; there&rsquo;s a rather forgiving reset button that lets you undo a crash for a limited number of times &mdash; but mastering the vehicles and physics will take time, intention, and no small amount of patience. This isn&rsquo;t the kind of game you can play with YouTube running on the other monitor. </p>



<p><em>Art of Rally </em>is a pure and uncluttered experience, but that might also be its one failing. Once you complete the excellent campaign, there isn&rsquo;t much to do except roam in free mode and get acquainted with the (admittedly gorgeous) photo tool. There are daily and weekly events from the developer, but those are essentially just remixes of existing content, like the custom livery that are the only built-in game mods. That might seem a bit anemic for a $25 game, though you can often find a key for far cheaper. </p>

<p>That said, <em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/550320/art_of_rally/&amp;xcust=2-2-1956731-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Art of Rally</a></em> is an absolute treat for anyone who loves technical, precision racing, and wants a game that doesn&rsquo;t demand a huge commitment in time. Or a huge commitment in GPU power, for that matter: Even with the settings turned up to the max, most GPUs can handle this game without breaking a sweat, and even my dinky little ThinkPad with integrated graphics managed to keep it humming along on integrated graphics. I&rsquo;m sure it would make a great addition to a Steam Deck.  </p>

<p>Gigantic monitors like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/563566/5-monitor-trends-from-ces-2022-that-pc-enthusiasts-need-to-pay-attention-to.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Samsung Odyssey Ark</a> tend to grab the headlines, but the truth is that very few of us will actually buy one, either out of basic frugality or just the fact that it would crack our desk in half from the weight alone. The latest Asus gaming monitor might be a relief in that regard. The ROG Swift PG38UQ is a 38-inch 4K monitor with a standard flat panel and 16:9 aspect ratio. That means it&rsquo;ll fit on even a small desk, so long as you don&rsquo;t have a massive gaming rig or other monitors fighting for space. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://rog.asus.com/monitors/above-34-inches/rog-swift-pg38uq/&amp;xcust=2-1-1956611-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PG38UQ</a> (spotted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.kitguru.net/peripherals/monitors/joao-silva/asus-introduces-38-inch-gaming-monitor-with-4k-resolution-and-144hz-refresh-rate/&amp;xcust=2-1-1956611-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">KitGuru</a>) has good specs, but it&rsquo;s not shooting for the moon or asking for a second mortgage. With an IPS screen panel and 1ms response time, it&rsquo;ll give great color quality even if it can&rsquo;t match the vibrance of the latest OLED screens, and 144Hz of refresh rate means it&rsquo;s ready for the latest games on both consoles and PCs. With double HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 1.4, it can pull double duty as either a large PC monitor or a smaller game-friendly television with the included remote (though you&rsquo;ll probably want to add a sound bar instead of going with the built-in 10-watt speakers). Four USB-A ports make it easy to attach accessories while keeping ports on your main PC free. </p>

<p>The display is compatible with Nvidia G-Sync (even without the extra hardware) and AMD Freesync Premium Pro, on top of an impressive 98% DCI-P3 color range and certification for VESA DisplayHDR 600. There are also a couple of creature comforts, like the GameVisual software that lets you adjust picture settings with mouse input instead of clunky OSD buttons, and a space under the stand for easy cable routing. One of the USB ports is even top-mounted for easy access to a webcam. </p>



<p>How much will the PG38UQ cost, and when can you buy it? Unfortunately Asus hasn&rsquo;t said yet, beyond a Q3 release. But based on the $1000 price tag of the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://rog.asus.com/us/monitors/32-to-34-inches/rog-swift-pg32uqr-model/&amp;xcust=2-1-1956611-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PG32UQR</a>, with similar specs, a slightly smaller screen, but a more expensive quantum dot panel, I&rsquo;d expect it to be around the same or slightly less.  </p>

<p>CRT monitors have surged back to relevance on a wave of nostalgia, driven by the exploding popularity of retro gaming. Unfortunately, most of the reviews, specification sheets, and comparison data that once existed has vanished from the Internet, making it difficult to know what you should look for while scanning eBay and Craigslist ads. </p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a modern display filled with pixels and fancy cutting-edge features, our guides to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/811315/best-monitors-2.html">best PC monitors</a>, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1470449/best-ultrawide-monitors.html">best ultrawide monitors</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/813361/best-4k-monitors.html">best 4K monitors</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/813301/best-gaming-monitors.html">best gaming monitors</a>&nbsp;can help you find the perfect fit with both concrete recommendations and buying advice. But shopping for old-school displays isn&rsquo;t quite so cut and dry. This particular guide will get you up to date on aging, but still hotly desired CRT monitors, so you can use the information to hunt down a retro gem of your own.</p>



<h2 id="why-you-yes-you-should-buy-a-crt-computer-monitor">Why you (yes, you!) should buy a CRT computer monitor</h2>



<p>CRT monitors fell from fashion with the same breathtaking speed as portable CD players and vinyl records. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=http://edition.cnn.com/2002/TECH/ptech/02/15/crt.monitors.idg/&amp;xcust=2-1-547715-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Three out of four monitors sold in 2001</a> were a CRT. But in 2006, Sony drew curtains on the era when it ceased production of new CRT TVs and monitors.</p>



<p>Still, CRTs have their perks. Most have a better contrast ratio and higher refresh rates than modern LCD monitors, so content looks richer and deeper. There&rsquo;s a sub-culture of first-person shooter fans who swear FPS games always look best on a high-end CRT monitor.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="crt monitor" class="wp-image-547717" height="1024" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/dell-crt-monitor.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith/IDG</p></div>



<p>A CRT is also a window into an entire era of media. Films, movies, and games produced from the dawn of television to around 2004 were created with a CRT in mind. You can enjoy older media on a modern LCD or OLED, but it will never look as originally intended. A CRT computer monitor is the most versatile, practical choice for tapping into nostalgia.</p>



<p>One quick note: This guide is for CRT computer monitors, <em>not</em> professional video monitors. PVMs are high-end CRT televisions. They&rsquo;re amazing for retro console gaming but aren&rsquo;t designed for use with a computer.</p>



<h2 id="what-crt-monitor-brand-is-best">What CRT monitor brand is best?</h2>



<p>Sony&rsquo;s Trinitron dominates the conversation just as it does in the world of retro CRT televisions and PVMs. Trinitron computer monitors are excellent, easy to find, and come from Sony, a brand people still recognize today. Other outstanding brands include Mitsubishi, Hitachi, LaCie, NEC, Iiyama, and Eizo.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Sony Trinitron Multiscan 200ES" class="wp-image-544413" height="683" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/285403_fbabbc2387_o.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><a class="imageCredit" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/turningpoint/285403/&amp;xcust=2-1-547715-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">kifo / Flickr</a></div>



<p>Dell, Gateway, HP, and Compaq monitors are less loved, but this can be an opportunity. Large PC manufacturers didn&rsquo;t make monitors in-house but rebranded monitors from others, and some use the same CRT tubes found in Trinitrons and other brands. Deciphering what&rsquo;s in a rebrand can be difficult, though, so you may need to take a leap of faith.</p>



<p>I don&rsquo;t recommend fretting brands and models if this is your first CRT. Trying to find a specific monitor is frustrating and, depending on your dream monitor, can take years (or cost thousands of dollars). Still, keep brand in mind when negotiating price. A Gateway monitor with mystery specifications might look great, but it&rsquo;s not worth top dollar.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="crt-monitors-are-old-but-newer-is-better">CRT monitors are old, but newer is better</h2>



<p>CRTs were improved and refined over the years. The oldest CRT monitors commonly sold are pushing forty years of age. They have a low maximum resolution, a low refresh rate, and small physical display size.</p>



<p>Newer CRT monitors, such as those produced in the mid-90s and the 2000s, will look sharper, handle reflections better, and have less noticeable lines or gaps in the image they display. You&rsquo;re also find better on-screen menus with extensive image quality options.</p>



<p>Luckily, CRT monitors often have a label indicating the year or even month of production. This is printed on the rear of the display or might be found on a sticker in this same location. Newer is better, and a CRT built this millennia are best.</p>



<h2 id="what-size-of-crt-monitor-is-best">What size of CRT monitor is best?</h2>



<p>Most CRT computer monitors have a display size between 13 and 21 inches. If you follow my advice and stick with newer monitors, though, you&rsquo;ll be comparing monitors between 15 and 21 inches.</p>



<p>I don&rsquo;t recommend going below 17 inches unless you&rsquo;re trying to replicate the experience of a late-80s or early-90s computer or have very limited space. Smaller CRT monitors feel tiny by modern standards. They also tend to support lower resolutions that are only ideal for enjoying older content.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="G4 next to two 19-inch Sony CRTs. Pic taken summer 2004." class="wp-image-544416" height="768" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2377292366_c55bdac942_o.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><a class="imageCredit" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/blakespot/2377292366/&amp;xcust=2-1-547715-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Blake Patterson / Flickr</a></div>



<p>There&rsquo;s such a thing as too large, too, so be cautious about massive CRTs. A 21-inch CRT monitor can weigh 50 or 60 pounds. You&rsquo;re unlikely to run into a CRT computer monitor larger than 21 inches, and if you do, it can weigh nearly 100 pounds. The <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://aperturegrille.fandom.com/wiki/SONY_GDM-FW900&amp;xcust=2-1-547715-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Sony GDM-FW900</a>, a truly epic 24-inch 16:9 CRT, is the most well-known of these rare beasts.</p>



<p>19 inches is the sweet spot. This size of CRT monitor remains manageable. It&rsquo;s about as tall as a 24-inch LCD (though narrower, of course) and isn&rsquo;t too hard to find. With that said, 17-inch monitors are more common and less expensive, so don&rsquo;t hesitate to leap on a 17-incher if you find one.</p>



<h2 id="what-resolution-of-crt-monitor-is-best">What resolution of CRT monitor is best?</h2>



<p>Resolution works differently on a CRT computer monitor than on a modern LCD. CRT monitors are an analog technology and don&rsquo;t have a native resolution. CRT monitors were sometimes marketed with a &ldquo;recommended&rdquo; resolution that served as a guideline, but CRTs computer monitors support a range of input resolutions and refresh rates.</p>



<p>Take the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=http://www.hitachidisplays.com/products/19_751_752_753.htm&amp;xcust=2-1-547715-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Hitachi SuperScan 751 as an example</a>. This 19-inch CRT computer monitor lists a maximum resolution of 1600 x 1200 at 85Hz but supports 1024 x 768 at 130Hz and 640 x 480 at 160Hz.</p>



<p>In general, the best resolution is the highest you can find. A monitor with a high maximum resolution will also support lower resolutions, and often a higher refresh rate.&nbsp; A resolution of 2048 x 1536 is the highest you&rsquo;re likely to see. 1600 x 1200 is more common.</p>



<p>The importance of resolution depends on your use. I use my CRT monitor to run Windows 95/98 in a virtual machine, play late-90s PC games, and emulate console games. All of these were designed with lower resolutions in mind, so the content I&rsquo;m viewing is usually at a resolution of 1024 x 768 or lower.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you want to use a CRT monitor to play <em>Doom: Eternal</em> at insane refresh rates with near-perfect response times, however, you&rsquo;ll prefer the highest resolution you can find. Resolution is not the final word on CRT monitor sharpness but in general a higher resolution will appear sharper.</p>



<h2 id="what-is-dot-pitch-and-why-does-it-matter">What is dot pitch, and why does it matter?</h2>



<p>Resolution doesn&rsquo;t determine the sharpness on a CRT monitor. But if that&rsquo;s true, what does?</p>



<p>The answer is a specification now hardly more than a memory: dot pitch.</p>



<p>Dot pitch is the distance between dots in a shadow mask or the distance between wires in an aperture grill. More on that in a moment. Remember that a CRT shoots electrons at the front of the display. The shadow mask or aperture grill filters the electrons so they hit phosphors at the front of the display and create a usable color image. The gaps in the shadow mask or aperture grill influences how sharp the image appears.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Maury Hall computer lab" class="wp-image-544376" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/49978326986_fb04dea44c_o.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><a class="imageCredit" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/schuminweb/49978326986&amp;xcust=2-1-547715-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ben Schumin / Flickr</a></div>



<p>Dot pitch is measured in millimeters. I recommend monitors with a horizontal dot pitch around .28 millimeters or lower. A dot pitch between .24 millimeters and .21 millimeters is excellent. Lower is better, but you likely won&rsquo;t find a monitor with a dot pitch below .21 millimeters in your search.</p>



<p>Make dot pitch a priority if you care about sharpness at resolutions beyond 1600 x 1200. A monitor with a lackluster dot pitch might support a high resolution but appear <em>blurrier</em> at a high resolution than a low resolution. This occurs when a CRT monitor&rsquo;s dot pitch isn&rsquo;t up to the task.</p>



<p>Dot pitch is less important if you only care to use a CRT at lower resolutions. Late-model CRT monitors will be enjoyable at 800 x 600 or 1024 x 768 no matter the dot pitch listed on their spec sheet.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="shadow-mask-vs-aperture-grill-which-is-better">Shadow mask vs. aperture grill: Which is better?</h2>



<p>A shadow mask or aperture grill is a filter a CRT computer monitor uses to make sure electrons end up where they should be. A shadow mask does the job with a metal mask of evenly spaced holes. An aperture grill uses an array of wires instead. Sony was the first to introduce aperture grill technology under the Trinitron brand name, but Sony wasn&rsquo;t the only company that sold CRT monitors with an aperture grill.</p>



<p>In general, a monitor with an aperture grill will be superior to one with a shadow mask. The aperture grill blocks less light than a shadow mask, which translates to a brighter and more colorful picture. The aperture grill is also better suited for a flat CRT display, though <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.hitachi.us/press/archive/05172000&amp;xcust=2-1-547715-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">flat shadow mask CRTs were produced</a>.</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s not to say shadow masks were trash. Hitachi and NEC put a ton of effort into shadow mask technology to rival Sony&rsquo;s Trinitron and had success. A late-model Hitachi ErgoFlat or NEC ChromaClear is a great monitor. If you&rsquo;re comparing two random, mid-range monitors, though, the aperture grill will probably be brighter and more attractive.</p>



<h2 id="what-refresh-rate-is-best-for-a-crt-monitor">What refresh rate is best for a CRT monitor?</h2>



<p>As mentioned, CRT monitors support a range of resolutions and refresh rates. The higher the resolution, the lower the refresh rate. Most late-model CRT monitors had a refresh rate of at least 75Hz at maximum resolution. Lower resolutions come with higher supported refresh rates with the best models topping out at 200Hz.</p>



<p>Refresh rate and resolution are linked. CRT monitors with the best refresh rates also support the highest resolutions. If you want the best refresh rate, then, you&rsquo;ll need to keep an eye out for a top-tier CRT monitor, and you should expect to use it at a resolution lower than the maximum it supports.</p>



<p>Obsessing over a CRT&rsquo;s refresh rate is often not worth the trouble. CRT monitors feel smooth not just because of refresh but also thanks to fundamental differences in how an image is produced. Nearly all late-model CRT monitors support a refresh rate of at least 75Hz at their maximum supported resolution and look exceptionally smooth.</p>



<h2 id="should-you-buy-a-crt-monitor-with-a-curved-or-flat-screen">Should you buy a CRT monitor with a curved or flat screen?</h2>



<p>Most CRT televisions and monitors have curved (also known as convex) glass. This was necessary to fix some problems of CRT technology. CRT makers found ways to overcome these issues by the mid-1990s and flat CRT displays hit the market. Shoppers loved them and flat-screen models dominated the final years of CRT production.</p>



<p>The big difference is the most obvious: Curved CRT monitors are curved, and flat CRT monitors aren&rsquo;t. Your choice should come down to the &ldquo;feel&rdquo; you&rsquo;re going for. A curved CRT will feel more accurate to a mid-90s PC or earlier, while flat screens were more common after the turn of the millennium. Those looking to use a CRT with modern software and games will prefer a flat screen as well.</p>



<h2 id="connectivity-its-all-vga-except-when-its-not">Connectivity: It&rsquo;s all VGA, except when it&rsquo;s not</h2>



<p>The vast majority of CRT computer monitors you&rsquo;ll encounter have a VGA video input. This is likely the only input on the monitor. It&rsquo;s an analog technology that most modern computers do not support, so you&rsquo;ll need an active DisplayPort or HDMI to VGA adapter. I use <a class="product-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003V4TV8O&amp;xcust=2-1-547715-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">a StarTech adapter from Amazon</a>.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="VGA connector, male" class="wp-image-544381" height="1053" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/VGA_Stecker.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><a class="imageCredit" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:VGA_Stecker.jpg&amp;xcust=2-1-547715-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Afrank99 / Wikimedia Commons</a></div>



<p>Be careful about the adapter you purchase. Many, including the one I purchased, have a maximum resolution and refresh rate below the best CRT monitors available. It works for me because I&rsquo;m mostly driving lower resolutions and my CRT monitor is a mid-range model. But I would need to upgrade if I bought a better CRT.</p>



<p>While VGA dominates by far, it&rsquo;s not the only input you might find. A handful of late-model CRTs support a version of DVI-A or DIV-I, which can provide an analog signal. CRT monitors from the 1980s might use a different video input. Commodore 1701 and 1702 monitors, for example, can use a composite input (just as you&rsquo;d find on a CRT television).</p>



<h2 id="how-to-buy-the-best-crt-monitor-a-cheat-sheet">How to buy the best CRT monitor: a cheat sheet</h2>



<p>You now have the knowledge to find the perfect CRT computer monitor for you. If you&rsquo;re feeling a bit overwhelmed, however, here&rsquo;s a cheat sheet.</p>



<ul><li><strong>What brand is best?</strong> Sony, Mitsubishi, Hitachi, LaCie, NEC, Iiyama, and Eizo.</li><li><strong>What size is best?</strong> 17 to 21 inches, though larger displays models may overwhelm your desk.</li><li><strong>What year is best?</strong> Newer is better unless you want a period-accurate monitor for a vintage PC.</li><li><strong>What resolution is best?</strong> 1600 x 1200 and higher is excellent.</li><li><strong>What refresh rate is best?</strong> Look for a refresh rate of 75Hz or higher.</li><li><strong>What dot pitch is best?</strong> .28 millimeters or lower is fine for general use. Look for .24mm or lower if you want to display a resolution of 1600 x 1200 or higher.</li><li><strong>Is a shadow mask or aperture grill better?</strong> Aperture grill monitors generally have a superior image.</li><li><strong>Is a curved or flat screen better?</strong> This is up to your preference.</li></ul>



<h2 id="where-to-find-a-crt-monitor">Where to find a CRT monitor</h2>



<p>There&rsquo;s no secret to finding or buying a CRT monitor. You will need a lot of patience or a lot of money.</p>



<p>The fastest way to buy a CRT monitor is <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=crt+monitor&amp;_in_kw=1&amp;_ex_kw=&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_udlo=&amp;_udhi=&amp;_ftrt=901&amp;_ftrv=1&amp;_sabdlo=&amp;_sabdhi=&amp;_samilow=&amp;_samihi=&amp;_sadis=15&amp;_stpos=03301&amp;_sargn=-1%26saslc%3D1&amp;_salic=1&amp;_sop=12&amp;_dmd=1&amp;_ipg=50&amp;_fosrp=1&amp;xcust=2-1-547715-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">eBay</a> or <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.etsy.com/search?q=crt%20monitor&amp;xcust=2-1-547715-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Etsy</a>. Hundreds of CRT computer monitors are available, including many that fit the recommendations of this guide. You&rsquo;ll have to spend several hundred dollars, however, and you can&rsquo;t see the monitor before buying. Shipping is a gamble, too. Many fine CRTs have met their demise in the hands of Fedex.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Local listings like Craigslist, OfferUp, and Facebook Marketplace can help you find a more affordable monitor, but stock can be limited depending on your location. Rural readers may have to search for months or drive long distances. Try to test the CRT before you buy, especially if it&rsquo;s not sold at a low price. Ask the seller to have it connected to a PC when you arrive.</p>



<p>Don&rsquo;t neglect searching offline. I snagged my current CRT computer monitor for free from someone a few blocks away who decided to put old electronics on the curb. Yard sales and estate sales are great, too. They can be a grind if you don&rsquo;t enjoy the search, but you&rsquo;ll spend a lot less than you would online.</p>



<p>Put out the word, as well. Post on social media about your search and ask relatives if they have a hidden gem. CRT monitors aren&rsquo;t easy to move or dispose of, so they&rsquo;re often stuffed in a closet, attic, or basement. Many people will let you have a monitor to get it out of their hair.</p>



<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Good luck on your search. Just remember: The best CRT monitor is the one you own. Don&rsquo;t be too harsh on the CRTs you come across. Your first task is finding one that meets your needs and reliably works. After that, you can get picky.&nbsp;Once again, if you&rsquo;re looking for a newer display filled with the latest and greatest goodies, our guides to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/811315/best-monitors-2.html">best PC monitors</a>, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1470449/best-ultrawide-monitors.html">best ultrawide monitors</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/813361/best-4k-monitors.html">best 4K monitors</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/813301/best-gaming-monitors.html">best gaming monitors</a>&nbsp;can help you find the perfect fit for your needs. </p>

<p>Is nothing working on your Windows 10 or Windows 11 computer? Is an application hanging, or is your PC unresponsive? Most people will reach for the hallowed Ctrl + Alt + Del keyboard shortcut, which has been used since the earliest days of DOS to revive a stuck computer. </p>



<p>You can also use the shortcut to call up the task manager (although Ctrl + Shift + Esc is faster at that). What many people probably <em>aren&rsquo;t</em> aware of, however, is the emergency restart function Microsoft hid inside the Ctrl + Alt + Del screen. I personally didn&rsquo;t know about it either until I read this article from <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://betanews.com/2023/06/15/how-to-access-the-hidden-emergency-restart-option-in-microsoft-windows/&amp;xcust=2-1-1956601-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">BetaNews</a>.</p>



<p><em>This article was translated from German to English, and originally appeared on pcwelt.de.</em></p>



<h2 id="how-to-activate-the-hidden-windows-emergency-restart">How to activate the hidden Windows emergency restart</h2>



<p>To get to the hidden emergency restart function, first press Ctrl + Alt + Del on your keyboard. The usual &ldquo;lock,&rdquo; &ldquo;switch user,&rdquo; &ldquo;sign off,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Task manager&rdquo; options will appear in a full screen. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Den Power Button mit gedr&uuml;ckt gehaltener Strg-Taste anklicken, um die Notfall-Neustart-Funktion von Windows 10/11 zu aktivieren" class="wp-image-1955896" height="684" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/PowerButton.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>To initiate the emergency restart, hold down Crtl and click the power button.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Foundry</p></div>



<p>You don&rsquo;t want any of those. Instead, tt the bottom right, next to buttons for network settings and accessibility functions, there is a power button for switching off or restarting the computer. You can use this button to access the hidden function<strong>:</strong></p>



<p>Hold down the Ctrl key and click on the power button. Now the following note is displayed by Windows in full-screen mode:</p>



<p><em><strong>&ldquo;Click OK to immediately restart. Any unsaved data will be lost.&rdquo;</strong></em> It then ends with this dramatic-sounding message: <strong><em>&ldquo;Use this only as a last resort.&rdquo;</em></strong> </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Emergency restart windows" class="wp-image-1956666" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/emergency-restart.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>



<p>Click on the &ldquo;OK&rdquo; button and the expected happens: The computer restarts immediately without any further prompting. </p>



<p>Apparently, Microsoft integrated this method into Windows as an additional way of subjecting the computer to a warm start. Depending on the reason why Windows is having problems at the moment, the other options for a Windows warm start might not work. Before resorting to the last resort of a cold start (i.e. holding down the physical on/off button on your PC or briefly disconnecting the device from the power supply), the hidden emergency restart could offer a way out.</p>



<h2 id="many-ways-to-shut-down-windows">Many ways to shut down Windows</h2>



<p>I have not yet been able to discover where Microsoft documented this feature, but it&rsquo;s nice to have another reboot option with the hidden Windows emergency restart. Here are a bunch of other ways you can restart Windows:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Method 1: </strong>Click Start button and then click Power button</li><li><strong>Method 2:</strong> Press &ldquo;Ctrl + Alt + Del&rdquo; and then click on the power button in the bottom right-hand corner</li><li><strong>Method 3:</strong> On the Windows desktop, press the combination Alt + F4 and then select &ldquo;Reboot&rdquo; from the drop-down menu</li><li><strong>Method 4: </strong>Open the command prompt with admin rights, type <code>-shutdown -r -t 00</code> and press Enter.</li><li><strong>Method 5:</strong> Go to the Windows Powershell, type &ldquo;Restart-Computer&rdquo; and press Enter.</li><li><strong>Method 6:</strong> The hidden emergency restart option</li></ul>

<p>CES might get the biggest headlines, but for desktop fans, there&rsquo;s no better trade show than Taeipei&rsquo;s Computex. The show was put on hiatus for two years, and technically back but severely muted in 2022, so this year was the first return to its full prominence. In addition to coverage of interesting individual products and broader trends, PCWorld had the chance to talk with some of the best minds around the technology publishing world about everything ranging from Ryzen CPU voltages to how building PCs differs around the world to whether or not <em>Star Citizen</em> is worth playing yet.</p>

But that&rsquo;s malarky, and Gordon joins fellow &ldquo;grumpy old PC gamer&rdquo; Leo of <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy-pYDfVaRwfQ0zChOBRuuw&amp;xcust=2-1-1953802-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">KitGuru</a> to tell you why. Dang spoiled kids. </p>

<p>For the last interview, let&rsquo;s take a look at Star Citizen, one of the white whales of PC gaming mentioned in the same breath as <em>Half-Life 3, Beyond Good and Evil 2,</em> and (formerly) <em>Duke Nukem Forever.</em> The space sim has been in development for over 13 years, and it&rsquo;s nowhere near finished. But Terrence of TechTok and the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3dl4J7AdGqNxntRX2Mnosw&amp;xcust=2-1-1953802-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">DaPoets</a> channel explains why you should play it in its years-long &ldquo;playable alpha&rdquo; state. </p>

<p>The big-screen laptop trend of recent has been moving from a 17.3-inch display with a widescreen 16:9 aspect ratio to a 16-inch 16:10 panel that results in a more compact and portable package with nearly the same screen real estate. Despite numerous refreshes over the past few years, the Dell XPS 17 still resides between these two popular panel sizes, with a 17-inch 16:10 display that&rsquo;s roomier than a 16-inch 16:10 display, but not quite as wide as a 17.3-inch 16:9 display. The result is an absolutely massive display for media editing, multitasking, and perhaps some light gaming.</p>



<p>Inside, the XPS 17 9730 serves up the latest Intel and Nvidia silicon. Our test system pairs a 13th-gen Core i7 CPU with RTX 4070 graphics. Dell prioritizes a thin enclosure over raw power, however, for this content creation laptop and opts for a low-wattage RTX 4070 that can&rsquo;t match the frame rates of gaming laptops with full-wattage RTX 40-series GPUs. And while the display&rsquo;s sheer size is certainly impressive, its 60Hz refresh rate is meh. Further, it&rsquo;s merely an IPS panel and not an OLED, which graphics pros and hobbyists can rightly expect at this price. We&rsquo;d steer content creators toward the similarly priced <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1525530/samsung-galaxy-book3-ultra-review.html">Samsung Galaxy Book3 Ultra</a> or <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/697179/asus-vivobook-pro-16x-oled-review-a-practical-creator-laptop-with-a-brilliant-display.html">Asus VivoBook Pro 16X OLED</a> that boast large OLED displays.</p>

<h2 id="dell-xps-17-specs-and-features">Dell XPS 17: Specs and features</h2>



<p>Our Dell XPS 17 9730 test system costs $3,349 from Dell, and I&rsquo;ve seen it on sale for as low as $2,949. It features the following specs.</p>



<ul><li><strong>CPU:</strong> Quad-core Intel Core i7-13700H</li><li><strong>Memory: </strong>32GB</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070</li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 1TB PCIe NVMe M.2 SSD</li><li><strong>Display:</strong> 17-inch UHD+ (3840 x 2400) 60Hz touch display</li><li><strong>Webcam:</strong> 720p</li><li><strong>Connectivity:</strong> 4 x Thunderbolt 4 USB Type-C, combo audio jack, SD card slot</li><li><strong>Networking:</strong> Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.3</li><li><strong>Biometrics:</strong> IR camera and fingerprint reader</li><li><strong>Battery capacity:</strong> 95 Watt-hours</li><li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 14.7 x 9.8 x 0.77 inches</li><li><strong>Measured weight:</strong> 5.4 pounds</li><li><strong>Price:</strong> $3,199.99</li></ul>



<p>The Dell XPS 17 9730 starts at $2,449 for a configuration with a Core i7-13700H CPU, RTX 4050 graphics, 16GB RAM, and a 512GB SSD. This baseline model features a 17-inch, non-touch display with a 1920&times;1080-pixel resolution. Our test system upgrades the graphics to an RTX 4070 GPU while doubling the RAM to 32GB and the solid-state storage to 1TB. The display also gets an upgrade to a 3840&times;2400 resolution and adds touch support. It was not included on our test system, but there is a CPU upgrade that moves you from the Core i7-13700H to a Core i9-13900H. In addition to the baseline RTX 4050 graphics and the RTX 4070 GPU on our test system, you also can configure the XPS 17 9730 with RTX 4060 or RTX 4080 graphics. There are also additional RAM (up to 64GB) and SSD (up to 8TB) options.</p>



<h2 id="dell-xps-17-thin-yet-rigid-design">Dell XPS 17: Thin yet rigid design</h2>



<p>The XPS 17 9730 shares the same enclosure as the preceding XPS 17 9720. It&rsquo;s an enormous expanse of a laptop that stretches nearly 15 inches wide and almost 10 inches deep. There&rsquo;s very little wasted space; with thin bezels on all four sides, the 17-inch 16:10 dominates the scene. You might have trouble fitting the XPS 17 9730 into your backpack because of its width and depth, but it&rsquo;s not a hulky laptop. It measures a trim 0.77 inches thick and weighs a reasonable 5.4 pounds.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Dell XPS 17 lid" class="wp-image-1955479" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Dell-XPS-17-9730-lid.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<p>The silver lid has the standard-issue, brushed-aluminum look, but open the laptop and you&rsquo;re greeted with a black keyboard deck with a carbon fiber finish running along the wrist rest and the narrow strip above the keyboard. The two-tone color scheme lets the XPS 9730 stand out from the all-silver or dull gray crowd. And the carbon fiber keyboard deck has a rubberized finish that has a pleasing feel and also is very effective at repelling fingerprints.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Dell XPS 17 carbon fiber" class="wp-image-1955480" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Dell-XPS-17-9730-carbon-fiber.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<p>Constructed from machined aluminum and carbon fiber, the XPS 17 9730 feels firm and rigid with little to no flex in the lid or keyboard deck, an impressive feat given its immense dimensions. Many large laptops tend to sag or flex toward their middles, and thin laptops often have flimsy lids that offer a worrisome level of protection for the display. With the XPS 17 9730, Dell pulls off the neat trick of building a thin, large-screen laptop with a solid overall feel.</p>



<p>Without a notch or lip on the front edge, opening the lid is a two-handed operation. I struggled to lift the lid with my fingertip and had to lift with from the side with both hands. Once opened, however, I found the keyboard to be quite comfortable. The keys don&rsquo;t have the plush feeling you get with a ThinkPad and instead offer a light, snappy feedback with shallow travel. I felt fast typing on it. Despite having the room for it, Dell opted not to include a number pad on the XPS 17 9730. And I didn&rsquo;t miss it. I liked having the keyboard centered below the display and above the giant touchpad.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Dell XPS 17 keyboard" class="wp-image-1955482" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Dell-XPS-17-9730-keyboard.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<p>The touchpad has a matte finish that allows for smooth, nearly friction-free gliding. It has a firm, quiet click response with the perfect amount of travel.</p>



<h2 id="dell-xps-17-big-bright-display-sans-oled">Dell XPS 17: Big, bright display (sans OLED)</h2>



<p>Our test system features the $300 display upgrade that bumps you up from a 17-inch 1,920 x 1,200 IPS non-touch display to a 3840&times;2400 IPS touchscreen. Brightness (500-nit rating) and refresh rate (60Hz) remain constant across the two display options. I found the display at 550 nits to be even brighter than its rating, and I found text and images to be razor sharp. And yet I&rsquo;m only mildly impressed with the 4K touch panel. Why? Because at a price north of $3,000, an OLED panel becomes a reasonable expectation. The XPS 17 9730&rsquo;s contrast ratio is fine, but it can&rsquo;t match that of an OLED with bright white and true black levels. For a high-end, large-screen laptop gear toward creative pros, a group that benefits more than most from the added color fidelity and contrast, it&rsquo;s surprising and disappointing that an OLED panel isn&rsquo;t offered.</p>



<p>Likewise, the display&rsquo;s pedestrian 60Hz refresh rate will be a disappointment to would-be buyers that might want to put the laptops RTX graphics toward a bit of 3D gaming when the workday is done. And video editors seek a faster 90Hz or 120Hz panel for smoother movement.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Dell XPS 17 display" class="wp-image-1955486" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Dell-XPS-17-9730-display.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<p>The webcam is another disappointment. It&rsquo;s a grainy 720p camera of yore and not a high-res 1080p camera that&rsquo;s offered on nearly even laptop released in the last year or two outside of budget models. Frankly, it&rsquo;s shocking that a laptop at this price doesn&rsquo;t have an upgrade webcam. The XPS 17&rsquo;s enclosure may not be in need of an overhaul, but its webcam certainly is.</p>



<p>The string of disappointments end with the speakers. Dell packs four speakers into the XPS 17 9730 in the form of a pair of 1.5-watt tweeters and a pair of 2.5 woofers. The resulting sound is louder and fuller and more dynamic than that of a typical laptop with only two speakers. Dialog sounded clear and effects sounded realistic when watching movies and shows, and I even enjoyed music playback because there was a bit of a bass response to round out the sound.</p>



<p>The modern port selection features four Thunderbolt 4 ports with DisplayPort and power delivery support, which should satisfy most of your external expansion needs. Dell includes an adapter in the box that provides USB-A and HDMI connectivity. There&rsquo;s also a combo audio jack and an SD card slot. Wireless connectivity, however, is a step behind the times. The XPS 17 9730 supports Wi-Fi 6 and not the newer Wi-Fi 6E standard.</p>



<h2 id="dell-xps-17-performance">Dell XPS 17: Performance</h2>



<p>Our XPS 17 9730 test system is based on the Core i7-13970HX CPU and GeForce RTX 4070 graphics. It also supplies a generous 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. The 13th-gen Core i9-13900HX features Intel&rsquo;s hybrid architecture with performance and efficiency cores; it has six performance cores, eight efficiency cores, and a total of 20 processing threads. The RTX 4070 is a midrange GPU in Nvidia&rsquo;s latest GeForce 40 series behind the RTX 4080 and 4090 graphics processors. In our test system, it&rsquo;s set to run at only 60 watts, in large part to keep thermals in check inside the XPS 17&rsquo;s thin enclosure. By comparison, the gaming-focused Legion Pro 7 Gen 8 features an RTX 4070 GPU running at its maximum of 140 watts &mdash; a combination of the GPU&rsquo;s maximum power draw of 115 watts and 25 watts supplied by the CPU via Dynamic Boost.</p>



<p>First up in labs testing is PCMark 10, which measures performance on everyday computing work including office productivity tasks, web browsing, and video chats. The XPS 17 9730 scored above a 7,000, which indicates elite application performance, but it still trailed last year&rsquo;s XPS 17 9720 and its 12th-gen Core i7 CPU.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Dell XPS 17 PCMark 10" class="wp-image-1955488" height="619" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Dell-XPS-17-9730-PCMark-10.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="898" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<p>Our HandBrake benchmark tests how a laptop is able to handle crushing CPU loads over a lengthy period&mdash;in this case, transcoding a 30GB MKV file to a format suitable for Android tablets using HandBrake, the free video encoding utility. The XPS 17 9730 again finished behind last year&rsquo;s XPS 17 model and actually finished last among the group of similarly configured and priced systems that are either midrange gaming machines or other content creation laptops.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Dell XPS 17 Handbrake" class="wp-image-1955489" height="618" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Dell-XPS-17-9730-HandBrake.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="898" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<p>Next up is Cinebench, another CPU-intensive test but one that renders a complex 2D scene over a short period of time. Again, the XPS 17 9730 finished near the end of the pack. The XPS 17 9730 is a capable content creation laptop but certainly not the fastest.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Dell XPS 17 Cinebench" class="wp-image-1955491" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Dell-XPS-17-9730-Cinebench.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="905" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<h2 id="dell-xps-17-graphics-performance">Dell XPS 17: Graphics performance</h2>



<p>Although the XPS 17 8730 isn&rsquo;t a gaming laptop, we still wanted to put its RTX 4070 graphics to the test. On 3DMark&rsquo;s Time Spy and Port Royal tests, it finished in the back of the pack, the leaders of which feature higher-wattage GPUs than our test system&rsquo;s 60-watt RTX 4070 GPU.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Dell XPS 17 Time Spy" class="wp-image-1955492" height="601" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Dell-XPS-17-9730-Time-Spy.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="905" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Dell XPS 17 Port Royal" class="wp-image-1955493" height="619" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Dell-XPS-17-9730-Port-Royal.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="920" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<p>On our real-world game benchmarks, the XPS 17 9730 produced playable framerates on our Shadow of the Tomb Raider benchmark at 1920&times;1080 resolution at the Highest quality preset but still trailed gaming laptops with GPUs operating at or near full throttle. We saw similar results on our Metro Exodus test, where the XPS 17 9730 averaged 39 fps. You&rsquo;ll need to dial back the quality settings or resolution to creep closer to a smooth framerate of 60 fps with Metro Exodus.</p>

<h2 id="dell-xps-17-battery-life">Dell XPS 17: Battery life</h2>



<p>To test a laptop&rsquo;s battery life, we loop a 4K video using Windows 11&rsquo;s Movies &amp; TV app, with the laptop set to Airplane mode and earbuds plugged in. We set the screen brightness at a relatively bright 250 nits to 260 nits, which is a good brightness for watching a movie in an office with the lights on. The XPS 17 9730 excelled on our battery test, running laps around its higher-powered gaming competition by lasting nearly 11 hours on our demanding battery drain test.&nbsp;Still, it fell a few minutes short of the runtime of last year&rsquo;s XPS 17 model.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Dell XPS 17 battery life" class="wp-image-1955499" height="619" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Dell-XPS-17-9730-battery-life.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="898" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Elliott</p></div>



<h2 id="dell-xps-17-should-you-buy-it">Dell XPS 17: Should you buy it?</h2>



<p>There&rsquo;s lots to like about Dell XPS 9730, from its expansive, 17-inch 16:10 display and thin, rigid chassis to its comfortable keyboard, roomy touchpad and outstanding battery life. The lack of an OLED display option, however, is a negative that will outweigh those positives for many content creators. With absolute black levels and stunning contrast ratio, an OLED display is far superior to any IPS panel and will be high on the priority list of any creative professional shopping for a laptop, if not at the very top. The lack of an OLED option prevents a stronger recommendation for the XPS 17 9730.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many PC gamers prefer the venerable keyboard and mouse, but controllers aren&rsquo;t just for consoles anymore. Controllers can actually improve the experience in certain games, particularly those ported from a console, and a controller can be a comfortable reprieve if you&rsquo;re already spending all day using a keyboard and mouse. There are as many controller options out there as there are games to play, so what&rsquo;s a PC gamer to do? We&rsquo;ve tested numerous game controllers from high-end devices with customizable hardware to bargain-basement wired models, and here are the best controllers for PC gaming.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to find fault with the current-gen Xbox controller, which was released in 2020. Microsoft&rsquo;s Xbox Series X/S update to the iconic gamepad added several long-overdue features, including Bluetooth connectivity, a USB-C port, and a dedicated share button. It has the standard asymmetrical thumbsticks we see on other Xbox-style gamepads. They&rsquo;re smooth and accurate in our testing, but 8BitDo&rsquo;s Hall-effect sticks are likely to last longer.</p>

<p>The Xbox controller retails for $60, but it&rsquo;s regularly on sale for $50 or less if you don&rsquo;t demand one of the fancy colors or elaborate skins. That price doesn&rsquo;t include a battery&mdash;this controller still takes two AA batteries. However, that&rsquo;s enough juice for 25 to 30 hours of gameplay. Microsoft&rsquo;s add-on battery pack is $25, but third-party versions are as little as $10, and that&rsquo;s worth the price.</p>

<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s controller might not have a ton of bells and whistles like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/398272/xbox-elite-controller-series-2-review-more-of-the-same-but-better.html">Elite controllers</a> or the 8BitDo Ultimate below, but the matte plastic body is sturdy, and we appreciate the microdot texture on the grips that make it less slippery in the hand. The more tactile, dish-shaped d-pad is a nice upgrade over most other controllers, too.</p>

<p>What really makes the Xbox Controller the best overall PC controller is simply that it works with everything. If a game has controller support on PC, it will understand the Xbox Controller without any coaxing. It also has a huge accessory ecosystem, offering docks, phone mounts, and more.</p>

<p>8BitDo made its name with retro-styled budget gamepads, but its Ultimate series controllers are worthy of even the most intense AAA games. The Ultimate Bluetooth Controller, as the name implies, has Bluetooth for use with smartphones and the Nintendo Switch. There&rsquo;s a 2.4GHz mode that works better with PCs, and it comes with the necessary 2.4GHz receiver inside the included charging dock. It also has a USB-C port if you don&rsquo;t have the dock handy or prefer wired gameplay.</p>

<p>The 8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller is slightly smaller and lighter than the Xbox controller (with batteries), but it feels very solidly constructed. We also appreciate the Hall-effect thumbsticks, which use contactless magnets instead of the potentiometers in most controllers. Thumbsticks are often the first component to go, causing the input to &ldquo;drift&rdquo; during gameplay. This won&rsquo;t happen with Hall-effect sensors in the 8BitDo Ultimate.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not the only advanced feature&mdash;the 8BitDo gamepad also has rear-facing paddle buttons, which you can assign controls or even macros using the 8BitDo Ultimate software. The interface is a little confusing at times, but it gives you full control over button mapping, thumbstick active areas, vibration intensity, and more.</p>

<p>The internal battery is good for at least 18 hours of gameplay (8BitDo claims two hours), so you don&rsquo;t have to buy a separate battery or burn through AAs like the stock Xbox controller. The only problem for PC gamers will be the ABXY button layout, which follows the Nintendo Switch design. It&rsquo;ll take some time to adjust if you&rsquo;re moving from an Xbox controller.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If Sony&rsquo;s DualSense controller were fully supported in Windows, it would be the hands-down winner. While we cannot give it a full-throated endorsement&mdash;call it an honorable mention&mdash;the DualSense has its place in PC gaming. It&rsquo;s a little more expensive than the Xbox controller, but the $70 DualSense feels great in the hand, looks slick, and it makes Sony games more immersive with myriad high-end features.</p>

<p>The DualSense has a symmetrical layout compared to the Xbox controller, which has one thumbstick higher than the other. The buttons and d-pad don&rsquo;t exhibit any wobble, and the press is solidly tactile. In our testing, the DualSense layout is more comfortable, but the trademark shape buttons won&rsquo;t match the controls in non-Sony games. However, functions will map to the same button locations as they would on an Xbox controller.</p>

<p>The PlayStation 5&rsquo;s controller works as a generic wireless Bluetooth controller in Windows, but you&rsquo;ll have to connect it over USB for the best experience (we tested USB C-to-C and C-to-A cables successfully). That allows games optimized for the DualSense to access its advanced hardware features. Sony has ported a dozen popular PS5 games on PC so far, and it plans to continue doing so.</p>

<p>When paired with an optimized game, the DualSense can leverage all its awesome custom features, including haptic feedback so precise it can simulate the feeling of raindrops. The tension in the triggers also adjusts based on what&rsquo;s happening in the game (e.g. firing a bow feels physically different than firing a gun), and it&rsquo;s used extensively in Sony&rsquo;s games. There&rsquo;s even a speaker that plays select game audio to further immersion. If you want to get the most from popular titles like <em>Spider-Man</em>, <em>God of War</em>, and <em>Returnal</em>, the DualSense is a must-have. Altogether, Sony and other developers have enabled DualSense features on about 30 titles, with more on the way.</p>

<p>The DualSense has a built-in battery that&rsquo;s good for about seven or eight hours. We like the integrated solution versus Microsoft&rsquo;s continued reliance on AA batteries, but the DualSense goes dead a bit too fast. Still, that only matters if you&rsquo;re using it in Bluetooth mode.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-look-for-in-a-controller-for-pc">What to look for in a controller for PC</h2>



<p>Depending on your budget, you might have to make compromises on a controller&rsquo;s features. But knowing how different features can affect your experience will help you make an informed choice.</p>



<h3 id="feel">Feel</h3>



<p>Your gameplay experience can be greatly impacted by the build quality of a controller. Mushy or wobbly buttons can be frustrating and cause mistakes in your games. Likewise, a controller that isn&rsquo;t comfortable to hold can be the difference between going out on a win and rage quitting.</p>



<h3 id="connectivity">Connectivity</h3>



<p>Most controllers today are wireless, but there are times you might want to use a cable. A controller that sports both Bluetooth and USB-C offers the most options for connecting to your PC.</p>



<h3 id="power">Power</h3>



<p>Wireless controllers need power, and the way you keep them juiced up can vary. Cheaper controllers with AA battery compartments get the job done, but an integrated battery charged via USB-C is more convenient. We also like to see accessories like charging docks, especially if they&rsquo;re included with the controller.</p>



<h3 id="customization">Customization</h3>



<p>The modern Xbox controller layout is tried and true, and the majority of controllers adhere to that standard&mdash;for most people, that&rsquo;s fine. For those who take their gaming more seriously, features like button remapping, programmable controls, and hardware customizations are nice to have.</p>



<h2>How we test controllers</h2>



<p>PCWorld&rsquo;s freelance and staff contributors have years of experience playing games individually, and combined, that metric no doubt stretches into multiple centuries. We believe the best way to test a controller is to rack up even more time gaming. We put controllers to the test in multiple genres, including shooters, RPGs, and fighters. This varied gaming experience helps to reveal any hardware shortcomings, latency, and compatibility issues.</p>



<div class="wp-container-1 wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<p>We compare each controller&rsquo;s unique features, pricing, and support in order to make recommendations. Some features may make games more enjoyable, but others are just a novelty or a waste of money. If controllers use desktop applications for customization or access to features, we dive into that as well.</p>
