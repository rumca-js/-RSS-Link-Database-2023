<p>The comedian’s highly watchable series about a booze-addled monarch who’s sent away to rule Australia proves one thing – she really excels at playing borderline sociopaths</p><p>Princess Georgiana is a hard-partying, red-headed spare to the throne of England whose unbecoming antics are catnip to the tabloids. Her co-creator (with Borga Dorter), Catherine Tate, assures us that she is not based on anyone in particular.</p><p>When the princess projectile-vomits over a child monarchist during a school visit while profoundly hungover, the king and queen (who, unlike the rest of us, naturally feel that this is not the deserved fate of any child monarchist) decide they’ve finally had enough of their wayward offspring. They vacate the throne of Australia so that she can be sent there as punishment – a last shot at redemption for “the pisspot princess”.</p><p>Queen of Oz aired on BBC Two and is available on BBC iPlayer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/16/queen-of-oz-review-catherine-tate-is-truly-monstrous-in-her-new-bbc-sitcom">Continue reading...</a>

Five balls after tea on a febrile, at times slightly hallucinogenic first day of the first Ashes Test Joe Root went down on one knee, shifted his grip, waited, then very gently and carefully reverse-nudged a ball from Scott Boland, Australia’s first-change new ball bowler, over third man for six.</p><p>This wasn’t really a ramp or a scoop, more a kind of flourish, the shot of a player seeing every detail in minute, slow-motion detail.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/16/joe-root-ashes-bazball-england-australia-first-test">Continue reading...</a>

## Cool, sexy and stinking of smoke: why are TV dramas giving cigarettes a comeback?

<p>From The Idol to Russian Doll, a wave of series is filling screens with characters that just love chainsmoking. But how has a habit whose days seemed numbered  returned to television?</p><p>If you were around to absorb 2000s pop culture, you will remember that smoking was considered cool, for a while. Kate Moss smoked. Alexa Chung smoked. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/feb/11/quiet-elegance-should-make-the-row-go-to-brand-for-wearable-chic">Olsen twins</a>, famously, smoked. Smoking was something you did in big sunglasses while having a bitching session on the street or outside a club. The ultimate accessory, in any scenario, was a ciggie dangling from your mouth as you went about your business. Sex and the City’s Carrie Bradshaw was the queen of this (smashing out her newspaper column on Marlboro Lights.) As were Bridget Jones, Rachel from Friends and pretty much anyone on a reality show, even up to 2018.</p><p>Then, like side fringes, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2000/aug/04/fashion3">Smirnoff Ice</a> and tights under denim shorts, smoking was suddenly passé – distasteful, even gross. Which makes sense, obviously: We know that smokers are <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/lung/basic_info/risk_factors.htm#:~:text=People%20who%20smoke%20cigarettes%20are,the%20risk%20of%20lung%20cancer.">15 to 30 times more likely</a> to get lung cancer than people who don’t smoke, and even smoking a little bit increases the risk of lung cancer and death. So, for a generation raised on “wellness”, dewy-faced health influencers and sobriety coaches, smoking simply wasn’t the vibe any more (the vaping conversation is for another day). For a while, you would very rarely see cigs on screen unless it was specific to the era (for example, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/mad-men-tv-series">Mad Men</a>).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/16/cool-sexy-and-stinking-of-smoke-why-are-tv-dramas-giving-cigarettes-a-comeback">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Aileen Cannon, appointed by former US president, issues first order in federal criminal case set to overshadow Republican primaries</p><p>Good morning, US politics blog readers. The wheels of justice are said to grind slowly, but they move nonetheless, including in the case of <strong>Donald Trump </strong>allegedly hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort. Yesterday, <strong>Aileen Cannon</strong>, the federal judge handling the matter (who also happens to be an appointee of the former president with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/14/trump-judge-miami-aileen-cannon-arraignment-indictment">a history of decisions</a> some observers say indicated partiality towards him), issued her first order in the case.</p><p>Cannon told all attorneys involved to obtain from the justice department the security clearances necessary to view the documents Trump is said to have kept with him after leaving the White House – which are crucial evidence for the prosecution. Security clearances are common among the defense and intelligence communities, and the order is largely procedural. But it’s the first step in what is expected to be a long legal road for the former president, with potentially great implications for the 2024 elections.</p><p><strong>The supreme court</strong> will at 10am eastern time release more decisions. There’s no telling which cases they will rule on, but outstanding matters include <strong>Joe Biden</strong>’s student loan relief plan and affirmative action at universities.</p><p><strong>Joe Biden</strong> and <strong>Kamala Harris</strong> are both taking jaunts out of Washington DC today.

What happened on the pitch was clear for all to see, though there is some disagreement as to why and, just as importantly, when the big decision was made.</p><p>It all started near the end of the playoff between Bengaluru and Kerala with a place in the championship semi-finals at stake.

<p>The company’s 2023 Showcase drove home the changes facing the industry, and its need to adapt after after the pandemic. Its CEO is positive the way forward is together</p><p>Phil Spencer is sitting alone on the stage at the Novo Theatre in downtown Los Angeles. The building is across the street from the empty LA convention centre which, in Junes gone by, would have been the thronging heart of the games industry universe. But that universe has changed irrevocably over the past two years. Things have to be done differently now – the future is uncertain.</p><p>Nobody knows that better than Spencer. Earlier today, he’d hosted a live showing of the Xbox 2023 Showcase in this auditorium, the seats packed with members of the Xbox fanbase. It was a raucous two hours of whooping and cheering, but Xbox has ground to make up. “2022 was a light year,” Spencer says, before instantly checking himself. “That’s kind of a positive way to put it.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jun/16/phil-spencer-on-the-future-of-xbox-most-people-just-want-to-find-a-great-game">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A college campus in the midwest provides the setting for this expansive novel of sex, politics and self-discovery</p><p>The stakes in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/03/brandon-taylor-writing-is-the-most-fun-im-capable-of-having">Brandon Taylor</a>’s fiction are always high – strikingly so, given these are campus novels. Lovers and gods are cruel; life’s beauty is dangerously close to being unbearable. Early on in The Late Americans, graduate student poet Seamus pictures his cohort as living in a dollhouse: “It was so easy to imagine the hands of some enormous and indifferent God prying the house open and squinting at them as they went about their lives … in an exhibit called The Late Americans.” Are our lives spectacles? And how can we continue to live when pain is both ubiquitous and mundane? The answer comes in bodily connection, but physical encounters may result merely in the transfer of pain.</p><p>Taylor emerged aged 30 with his Booker-shortlisted 2020 debut <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/21/real-life-by-brandon-taylor-review-violent-legacy-of-the-past">Real Life</a>. This was a painful, often funny, always dazzling autobiographical novel, with the narrator closely inside the head and body of its lonely Black, gay graduate student protagonist. Taylor revealed himself as brilliant at intense, awkward social comedy, and revelatory, unerotic sex scenes. The skill was in the delineation of moment-by-moment bodily life, charting tiny shifts between tenderness and violence and the hourly exhaustion of being in a disordered body. Unusually, Taylor was prepared to tell as well as to show, using his characters to think hard about his world.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/16/the-late-americans-by-brandon-taylor-review-a-class-act">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The band’s image as Iceland’s joyous musical elves was destroyed by allegations of tax evasion and sexual assault. Now a trio, they explain their search for beauty with their first album in a decade</p><p>Sigur Rós’s new album Átta, their first in a decade, is a tender and consoling piece of work that seems to extend a healing hand to the listener. Given the dramatic events in the band members’ lives during its long gestation, you suspect it serves a similar purpose for the Icelanders themselves. “It’s a comfort blanket for us maybe,” agrees frontman Jón Pór “Jónsi” Birgisson from his home in Silver Lake, Los Angeles. The period the album emerged from was, he says, “depressing and heavy and intense”.</p><p>In March 2018, the Icelandic government accused Sigur Rós of evading 151m króna (£840,000) of tax between 2010 and 2014. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/28/sigur-ros-band-members-charged-with-tax-evasion-by-icelandic-authorities">The band blamed an accounting error </a>and repaid the debt plus interest, but faced a second prosecution for the same offence in 2020, which froze their assets. They have all now been acquitted but Birgisson has been off the hook only since March. And that was not all. In September 2018, artist Meagan Boyd publicly accused drummer Orri Páll Dýrason of sexual assault five years earlier. Dýrason denied the allegations but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/01/sigur-ros-drummer-orri-pall-dyrason-quits-rape-allegations">resigned a few days later</a>, temporarily reducing Sigur Rós to a transatlantic duo of Birgisson and bassist Georg “Goggi” Hólm.

<p>Barcelona won La Liga despite financial turmoil, Vinícius took on racists and managerial chaos engulfed Elche, Celta and Sevilla</p><p>It wasn’t quite “Camp Nou: available for weddings and barmitzvahs” but it was close. It was also seriously tempting. For only €300, you too could play in European football’s biggest stadium. Sixty minutes, a ref, coaches and Gatorade; medical attention as well, which was probably a good thing. Some €1bn in debt and with a salary limit of <em>minus</em> €144m, Barcelona had to raise money somehow if they were to start the virtuous cycle their president talked about. Or just the season with the men they had signed. Trouble was, even hundreds of people playing hundreds of games weren’t going to cover Gerard Piqué sitting on the bench for just one. Which is where the <em>palancas</em> came in.</p><p><em>The</em> word of last summer, suddenly it was everywhere, part of the footballing lexicon, maybe even its folklore. Selling players wasn’t easy, although they really did try, and so Barcelona sold other assets instead. TV rights, mostly. In total, they pulled four <em>palancas</em>, or levers, putting €777m <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/12/barcelona-race-against-time-amid-desperate-grasp-at-short-term-levers">on the balance sheet</a> and seven new players on the pitch. At 9.30pm on the evening before La Liga started, Robert Lewandowski, Raphinha, Andreas Christensen and Ousmane Dembélé were finally registered along with Franck Kessié. Jules Koundé had to wait a while.

<p><strong>(Jay Vee)</strong><br />Every morsel of gravel is audible in the septuagenarian’s voice as, backed by a stellar band, she proves the thrill is far from gone</p><p>When <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/aug/27/bettye-lavette-james-brown-kanye-west-aretha-franklin-kamala-harris">Bettye LaVette</a> growls “same old words, same old song” midway through the latest album of her six-decade career, don’t mistake it for complacency. Much of the magic of LaVette! lies in the 77-year-old soul survivor’s ability to invest classic R&amp;B tropes with the world-weary experience and infallible wisdom of age, so they hit different. She has trodden these paths of heartbreak enough times to roll her damned eyes, and you can hear that in her seasoned rasp.</p><p>Every morsel of gravel is audible in her voice on LaVette! She didn’t sound like this when she cut her first single, <a href="https://youtu.be/kDPXOoStt9I">My Man, He’s a Lovin’ Man</a>, for Atlantic Records back in 1962, her vocal pristine, like a honeyed Carla Thomas. Over the years, as her career smouldered but never quite caught fire, the grain came to the fore, so when her career unexpectedly revived in the early 00s, she had grown into a singer whose audible intolerance of bullshit you’d be unwise to ignore.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/16/bettye-lavette-lavette-review">Continue reading...</a>

## One Midsummer’s Day by Mark Cocker review – the extraordinary life of swifts

<p>Wonder and gratitude drive a revelatory account of this vital summer visitor</p><p>This book’s subtitle, Swifts and the Story of Life on Earth, is the first clue to its ambition. In his mission to restore a sense of wonder to life’s small and ordinary things, Mark Cocker – author of the award-winning Crow Country – takes us on a soaring journey from the Cretaceous period to a summer’s day in his English garden, via angiosperms, bacteria, flying ant day, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/tedhughes" title="">Ted Hughes</a> and the magnetic field caused by our planet’s iron core – “the Earth’s innermost soul” – to demonstrate the essential interconnectedness of everything. Like the birds he tracks as they skirl and scream above his home, the book covers a great distance, and not always in a straight line. It is not easy to express awe in writing without flipping into hyperbole or cliche, but in his promise to express “how it takes a whole universe to make just the one small black bird”, Cocker aims high.</p><p>In an explanatory note, he says: “This is not strictly a book of science but the hybrid form that is conventionally associated with the term ‘nature writing’.” It is certainly scientifically rigorous – packed with copious footnotes, end notes and references to a glossary – and the bare facts it lays out are extraordinary. Swifts have been recorded at altitudes of 4,400m, and travel so far in a single trip that a nesting pair feeding their chicks in southern England could be scooping up insects above Germany. They weigh just 40g but have a wingspan of 42-49cm; a human would need arms 800 metres long to match the weight to width ratio. But it is also lyrical, grand and full of reverence. “You could say that the sounds of the birds, burning over our house amid their contrails of scream, are a part of the song of the Earth turning in outer space,” Cocker writes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/16/one-midsummers-day-by-mark-cocker-review-soaring-with-swifts">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In 1967, Roger Payne, who has died at 88, noticed that the mammals’ calls were organised in repeating patterns, spurring the discovery of whale song </p><p>The idea that whales “sing”, commonly accepted today, is relatively recent.

It is the 67-year-old actor’s first visit to Cannes: in part because his greatest triumphs have been on TV, most notably in Breaking Bad; in part, perhaps, because he prefers to avoid the hurly-burly of big events.
