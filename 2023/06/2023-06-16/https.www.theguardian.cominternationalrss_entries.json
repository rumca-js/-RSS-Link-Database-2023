The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/feb/11/quiet-elegance-should-make-the-row-go-to-brand-for-wearable-chic\">Olsen twins</a>, famously, smoked. Smoking was something you did in big sunglasses while having a bitching session on the street or outside a club. The ultimate accessory, in any scenario, was a ciggie dangling from your mouth as you went about your business.
