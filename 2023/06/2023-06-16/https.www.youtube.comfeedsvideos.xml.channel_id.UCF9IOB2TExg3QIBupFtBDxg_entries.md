Big factor in Australian excess deaths.

Excess deaths in 2022

22,000 (12%) excess deaths

(Population 26 million)

Excess mortality is widely regarded as the best measure of the overall impact of a pandemic,

since it includes deaths both directly and indirectly due to the disease.

Of the 20,200 excess deaths in 2022

10,300 deaths (51%) were from COVID-19

2,900 deaths (15%) were COVID-19 related, 

(meaning that COVID-19 contributed to the death)

7,000 deaths (34%) had no mention of COVID-19 on the death certificate.

Non-COVID-19 deaths represent excess mortality of 4%, 

(which is extraordinarily high in itself) 

Most excess deaths were in 65+

But, excess mortality was at least 5% higher in ALL age groups

It is notable that there are excess deaths in all age groups,

and that this excess is generally significant, 

even after removing COVID-19 deaths

Excess deaths higher in females than males

The differences are worth investigating,

(although the small numbers mean that there is considerable natural variation)

Excess mortality in all States

WA excess deaths were delayed due to late reopening

Many more deaths from IHD

Ischaemic heart disease

Much higher number of deaths than expected from IHD

(despite continued deaths from dementia)

Deaths from respiratory disease have been significantly lower than expected throughout the pandemic
