<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft released 73 updates to its Windows, Office, and Visual Studio platforms on Patch Tuesday, with many of them dealing with core, but not urgent, security vulnerabilities. That's a welcome respite from the previous six months of urgent zero-days and public disclosures. With that in mind, the <a href="https://applicationreadiness.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Readiness</a> testing team suggests a focus on printing and backup/recovery processes to make sure they're not affected by this update cycle.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the first time, we see a (non-Adobe) third-party vendor added to a Patch Tuesday release, with three minor plugin updates to Visual Studio for AutoDesk.

<p>I remain convinced that the market is looking for something revolutionary like Apple’s recently announced <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Vision Pro</a> to replace smartphones, tablets, and PCs.
