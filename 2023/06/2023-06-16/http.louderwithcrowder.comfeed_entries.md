I could go the rest of my life without knowing the shrill harpies from <em>The View</em> still have a show. But because he has to <a href="https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/nicholas-fondacaro/2023/06/16/torching-words-view-worries-about-paper-genocide-against" target="_blank">go sharing their clips to expose the libs</a>, and because I made the mistake of scrolling Twitter while I was enjoying a glass of bourbon and listening to music, I now know <em>The View</em> is trying to make "paper genocide" happen to describe book "banning."</p><p>Of course, it's racist Sunny Hostin that said it. You could have guessed Joy Behar, but she was <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/white-house-pride-rose-montoya" target="_blank">busy calling Joe Biden flying the LGBTQ battle flag on the White House</a> a photoshop.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cOpposition to anything liberal is now "genocide."\nRacist Sunny Hostin touts mom handing out "banned books" (that means they're not "banned") and says they fight back against "paper genocide."\n"Maybe that's the only way to stop this paper genocide we're seeing of our history."\u201d</div> — Nicholas Fondacaro (@Nicholas Fondacaro)
        <a href="https://twitter.com/nickfondacaro/status/1669729963233214464">1686929194</a>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>There are mothers groups where I live and they're picking up banned books and giving them back to schools, giving them back to libraries. And there are mobile little libraries filled with banned books. <strong>And I think maybe that's the only way that we can stop this paper genocide that we're seeing of our history.</strong> We need to insist that we get these books back out there.</blockquote><p>The reason she gets away with calling book "banning" a paper genocide is because the left gets away with saying "trans genocide." That is what progressives say to delegitimize any opposing viewpoint about girls' sports and whether seven-year-olds can decide about having their balls cut off.</p><p>No books are being banned. If a parent in Florida feels their kid learning about <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chelsea-clinton-book-banning" target="_blank">tasting their vagina slime, how to give a handy to make someone cum, or read a graphic novel about two dudes f*cking</a> is crucial to their development, that parent can go on Amazon.com and have the book by tomorrow. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis/" target="_self">Ron DeSantis</a> only signed a law saying schools won't provide it.</p><p>Though in fairness to Hostin, she said "history." She could be talking about how Florida's BOE rejected a single AP African American History curriculum. Because <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/andrea-mitchell-apologizes-team-desantis" target="_self">while the state believes students should learn</a> about...</p><blockquote><em>Instructional personnel may facilitate discussions and use curricula to address, in an age-appropriate manner, how the individual freedoms of persons have been infringed by slavery, racial oppression, racial segregation, and racial discrimination, as well as topics relating to the enactment and enforcement of laws resulting in racial oppression, racial segregation, and racial discrimination and how recognition of these freedoms has overturned these unjust laws.</em></blockquote><p>...and that...</p><blockquote><em>Students shall develop an understanding of the ramifications of prejudice, racism, and stereotyping on individual freedoms, and examine what it means to be a responsible and respectful person, for the purpose of encouraging tolerance of diversity in a pluralistic society and for nurturing and protecting democratic values and institutions.</em></blockquote><p>...learning about who is f*cking who (aka, the "queer studies" the left tried sneaking in) was not appropriate.</p><p>That is hardly genocide. You know how I know? NOT A SINGLE PERSON WAS KILLED, LET ALONE MANY PEOPLE TO CONSTITUTE A GENOCIDE. Stop calling opinions you don't like a genocide.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Fox News producer responsible for Biden "wannabe dictator" chryon speaks out: "Today was my last day at FOX"

His last day at the company was on Thursday. Getting out before human resources at NewsCorp <a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-fox-news-promotes-glory-holes-child-sterilization-to-employees-leaked-documents-reveal" target="_blank">made him learn about glory holes</a>, McCaskil was responsible for the now infamous chryon that called Joe Biden a "wannabe dictator."</p><p>You know those words at the bottom of the screen when you watch cable news? That's the chryon. On Tuesday, while both Joe Biden and Donald Trump were giving campaign speeches, "Wannabe dictator speaks at the White House after having his political rival arrested" flashed across the screen.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>Joe Biden's Department of Justice brought Trump (one of the ten or so people running against Biden for president) up on <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/donald-trump-indictment-claims" target="_blank">thirty-seven federal counts concerning Trump's handling of classified information</a>. Since the DOJ is led by a man Joe Biden appointed to lead the DOJ (Merrick Garland), there are people who believe Biden is trying to get Trump arrested. <a href="https://freebeacon.com/media/fact-check-nearly-100-percent-of-political-contributions-from-fact-checkers-go-to-democrats/" target="_blank">"Independent" fact-checkers</a> will counter and say "nuh-uh," while claiming with a straight face that the DOJ operates independently from the White House.</p><p>McGaskil told friends on Instagram that it was his last day at Fox News. "It was a wild 10 years and it was the best place I’ve ever worked because of the great people I met. But the time has come. I asked them to let me go, and they finally did. To all my friends there: I will miss you forever.”</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cFormer Fox News producer Alexander McCaskill, who parted ways with the network for airing the "wannabe dictator" chyron, posted this photo of him leaving Fox offices on his Instagram.\n\nMcCaskill was also a longtime producer/editor for Tucker Carlson.\n\nhttps://t.co/MvJqRMiBOR\u201d</div> — Justin Baragona (@Justin Baragona)

<blockquote>He had been at Fox for more than a decade. He was considered one of the most capable people in the building. He offered to stay for the customary two weeks, but Fox told him to clear out his desk and leave immediately.</blockquote><p>It is unclear as of this writing what will become of Alexander McCaskil. There is an above-average chance the producer had decided Fox News was no longer a good fit for him and already knew he was going to quit. If that is the case, "Wannabe dictator speaks at the White House after having his political rival arrested" will go down as an all-time "middle-fingers in the air as you tell you boss to suck it" moment in the history of corporate America.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## WaPo capes for Dylan Mulvaney, blame "Cinco de Mayo," Americans no longer liking beer for Bud Light's troubles

<p>Dude, the Community Notes weren't there when I started this. Well done, Community Notes.</p><p><br /></p><h3>Summarize the Bud Light boycott for me</h3><br /><p>There were twists and turns and all sorts of shenanigans. But here are the <strong>LWC Keys to Bud Light F*cking Up</strong>:</p><ol><li>As part of Bud Light's NCAA tournament coverage, and to appeal to people who don't like either for some reason, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/captiv8-bud-light-dylan-mulvaney" target="_self">someone at Bud Light decided to work with titface performer Dylan Mulvaney</a>.</li><li>Melissa Weinerchild, the (now former) VP of Marketing responsible, made it clear on a podcast how much she hated Bud Light's loyal fanbase, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-exec-bear-market" target="_self">lashing out at them as fratty and out of touch</a>.</li><li>Bud Light fans from across the spectrum (NOT just the extreme right, we're not that organized) <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-fenway-park" target="_blank">decided this was one woke pander from a company that hates them too many</a>, and now Bud Light is no longer the #1 beer in America.</li></ol><h3>What is Washington Post saying?</h3><br /><p>As you see in the tweet, WaPo blames Americans for not liking American beer anymore. The content creators at WaPo know most Twitter users won't click the link, so they make sure the talking point they want people to run with is in the tweet.</p><p><a href="https://archive.is/WOSdM" target="_blank">If you read the article</a>, while dismissing the boycotts, they ask if El Cinco De Mayo has anything to do with Modello dethroning Bud Light. You know, because Mondello is a Mexican beer.</p><blockquote>While recent events...</blockquote><p>They mean the boycotts by normie-Americans getting fed up over having the left's woke politics shoved down their throats.</p><blockquote>...may have affected Bud Light sales...</blockquote><p>Spoiler: They <em>did</em> affect Bud Light sales.</p><blockquote>...broad market trends were favoring Modelo even before the Mulvaney controversy [...] Asked whether Cinco de Mayo, the Mexican holiday, contributed to Modelo’s May success, [Dave Williams, vice president of analytics and insights at Bump Williams] said: “Modelo has been on a steady rise for a long stretch now, and while holiday-timed executions can lead to some lift in sales, they continued to perform after Cinco de Mayo just as well.”</blockquote><p class="">Also, as Community Notes points out, for a beverage that is on decline in America, Bud Light is the only beer declining at such an INSANE rate. Busch, Natural, Miller, and Keystone <strong><a href="https://t.co/VF2xImqRWP" target="_blank">have not experienced the 29% drop in sales</a></strong> of Bud Light that has coincided with the boycott of the brand. <a href="https://www.bevindustry.com/articles/95649-2023-beer-report-super-premium-domestics-bright-spot-among-domestic-beers" target="_blank">Miller Lite and Coors have seen growth</a> of 20.7% and 22% respectively during that same time.</p><p>Of course, all those beers are also owned by giant corporations looking to profit off of a global market. AKA, they hate you and everything you stand for. That's why we at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website advocate drinking local. Even if local brewers vote for different people than we do, they tend not to be sh*tc*nts about it.</p><p>But Bud Light is down an ENORMOUS amount. In the tens of b-b-b-billions. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/target-wapo-bomb-threat-pride" target="_blank">Not unlike how Target is down</a> tens of b-b-b-billions. I wonder if there is a relationship between the two.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## South Korean dude rejects being called racist for hating Little Mermaid: "You keep asking us to watch sh*tty movies"

There is a story in the news about a raaaaacist backlash to Disney's <em>The Little Mermaid</em>. A video of a based South Korean chad is going viral being asked about <a href="https://cosmicbook.news/disney-hypocrisy-makes-little-mermaid-white-for-china-poster" target="_blank">a raaaaacist backlash to a movie</a>. Perhaps he's being asked about a raaaaacist backlash to a different movie? If that is the case, allowed me to apologize on behalf of all of us here at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website.<br /></p><p>Now check out my man here.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>The "Western media" in question could be Western journalisming content creators CNN, who just posted a piece of content titled "<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/06/media/little-mermaid-box-office-china-korea-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank">‘The Little Mermaid’ tanks in China and South Korea amid racist backlash from some viewers</a>." The blog post points out that while having a black Ariel has been "celebrated elsewhere," a handful of cherrypicked cinephiles disagree with the casting choice. </p><p>In the case of South Korea, CNN cites one single person who expressed disappointment on Instagram.</p><blockquote>[The Little Mermaid] brought in just 19.5 million yuan ($2.7 million) in its first five days, compared with 142 million yuan (nearly $20 million) for “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” in the first five days of that film’s opening, according to Chinese box office tracker Endata. <br /></blockquote><blockquote>Similar sentiment was found on social media in South Korea. On Instagram, one user wrote that the movie had been “ruined” for them, adding “#NotMyAriel.”</blockquote><p>Right. It <em>could</em> be raaaaacist backlash. Or, your movie can get just suck. The <em>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse</em> movie that has made at least five times more money? The lead character has brown skin.</p><p>There are two things at play here. The first is that Hollywood <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/anthony-mackie-hollywood-china" target="_blank">makes movies counting on the Asian market</a> to make them their money. It's why <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/john-cena-china-taiwan-apology" target="_blank">John Cena had to cuck himself</a> for saying the word "Taiwan." If a movie doesn't do well overseas, it's a global failure,</p><p>This brings us to point number two. In the woke progressive hive mind, nothing is ever their fault for pushing an agenda on people. It can only be the fault of an -ism or a -phobia. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/leslie-jones-ghostbusters-reboot" target="_blank">It started with the girl <em>Ghostbuster</em> movie in 2016</a>, which looked like a bucket of sh*t from the first trailer. When moviegoers decided not to spend their money on a bucket of sh*t, filmmakers lashed out at the audience. A single YouTube comment from someone who said "the movie ruined their childhood" was used in the marketing to shame people into seeing the movie if they didn't want to be labeled an -ist.</p><p>If you make movies that don't look like they suck, people will spend money to go see your movie. This isn't something that needs to be explained.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Child sex offender tries poisoning himself with a Snickers bar as jury declares him guilty for nine years of abuse

Because you might find yourself getting raped in prison for being a child molesting scumbag if you don't. Also, it helps if your candy bar is laced with rat poison. That was one man's calculation when he scarfed down a snack as a jury declared him guilty of being a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/another-child-sex-offender-discovered-at-drag-queen-story-time" target="_blank">child sex offender</a>.</p><p>The judge in the case said, "A jury of your peers has found you guilty of... dude, what are you doing?"</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>The dramatic situation unfolded in Australia, <a href="https://www.standard.net.au/story/8233186/rat-poison-in-snickers-bar-fails-to-kill-child-sex-abuser/" target="_blank">where a local reporter witnessed everything</a>. The 70sish-year-old man -- <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/melbourne/article-12196495/Child-sex-offender-eats-Snickers-chocolate-bar-laced-rat-poison-guilty-verdict.html?ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_campaign=1490&amp;ito=1490" target="_blank">name withheld for Australian legal reasons</a> -- was on trial for raping his partner's young daughter. Prosecutors alleged that over a nine-year period, he abused the girl when she was between four and fourteen years old. </p><p>As the guilty verdict was being read, the man produced a Snickers bar. The judge ordered him to stop eating when the man informed the courtroom his treat was laced with rat poison. Later on that day, as he was put back in jail, the rat poison kicked in and he collapsed. </p><p>Unfortunately for the man, but fortunately for justice, it was not enough rat poison to kill him. The <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/forced-dig-grave" target="_blank">now guilty pedo</a> was returned to his jail cell.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="b127c" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=34130898&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>The man awaits a September 11th hearing to find out his sentence. Sexually abusing a minor over a nine-year period, one would think (and hope) would lead to a lengthy prison sentence. Here's to hoping the pedo finds himself some new friends who want to poison him with their Snickers bar.<br /></p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

<p>It is a reference to this other tweet Team DeSantis put out when Joe Biden claimed all your kids belong to him. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/desantis-campaign-elon-musk-tear-biden-white-house-tweet-our-kids" target="_blank">It was all over the news</a> when Elon Musk amplified it.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Urban Dictionary defines "groomer" as "someone who builds a relationship, trust and emotional connection with a child or young person so they can manipulate, exploit and abuse them." <strong>At no point did Team DeSantis call Joe Biden a "groomer."</strong> That was Mediaite's word. They are the ones who saw a video of Joe Biden groping children and jumped to the conclusion that he is someone who builds a relationship, trust and emotional connection with a child or young person so he can manipulate, exploit and abuse them.</p><p>Team DeSantis was talking about Biden Democrats' belief your kids are government property. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/students-are-teachers-children" target="_blank">It is why they don't want parents to have any say in what goes on in government schools</a>. It's also why Democrats want to take your children away if you don't affirm the Democrat Party's platform.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201c.@AsmLoriDWilson says that if your 7 year old says \u201cthey are not the same gender as they are biologically,\u201d their belief must be affirmed, because to do otherwise would be to reject your child.

<p>"Bizarre" is an odd word choice too. Joe Biden being unable to keep his hands to himself is nothing new, and something both Republicans AND Democrats have attacked him for. In 2019, Biden was <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1113515882960052224" target="_blank">forced to release a video apologizing for being gropey</a> when other Democrat presidential candidates like former Senator Kamala Harris attacked him for it and implied it should disqualify him from becoming president.</p><p>As we now know, it did not disqualify him. And <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-creepy-veterans-daughter">the President</a> still has <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-kids-connecticut-school">not learned about personal space</a> or the difference between <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-creepy-girls-dancing">good versus bad touching</a> since.</p><p>I ask that you all join me in praying to the deity or deities of content that Karine Jean-Pierre gets asked about the DeSantis video during today's White House briefing. In their name and wisdom, we praise.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
