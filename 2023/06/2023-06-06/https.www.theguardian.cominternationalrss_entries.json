Sign up for the full article here</a></strong></p><p>Yesterday, Apple finally confirmed the worst-kept secret in Silicon Valley, and announced the Vision Pro, its $3,499 virtual reality headset. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/05/apple-vision-pro-ar-headset-revealed-worldwide-developers-conference\">From our story</a>:</p><p>The headset allows users to interact with \u201capps and experiences\u201d, the Apple vice-president of human interface design, Alan Dye, said, in an augmented reality (AR) version of their own surroundings or in a fully immersive virtual reality (VR) space.</p><p>\u201cApple Vision Pro relies solely on your eyes, hands and voice,\u201d Dye said. \u201cYou browse the system simply by looking. App icons come to life when you look at them; simply tap your fingers together to select, and gently flick to scroll.\u201d</p><p>EyeSight, which sounded so ridiculous, could actually \u2026 work? A curved, outward-facing OLED screen displays the wearer\u2019s eyes to the outside world, giving the impression of the headset as a simple piece of translucent glass. The screen mists over if the wearer is in a fully immersive VR space, while allowing people to have (simulated, at least) eye contact when in AR mode.</p><p>An array of downward and outward-pointing IR cameras let the headset keep track of your position and gestures at all times, allowing the company to build a controller-free experience without requiring the wearer to hold their hands in their eye-line when using the headset.</p><p>An AI-powered \u201cpersona\u201d (don\u2019t call it an avatar) stands in for you when you make a video call using the Vision Pro. It\u2019s a photorealistic attempt to animate a real picture of you, using the data the headset captures of your eye, mouth and hand movements while you talk. Even in the staged demos, it looked slightly uncanny, but it seems a far smaller hurdle to introduce into the world than trying to encourage people to have business meetings with their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/17/bitmoji-emoji-avatar-app-downloaded-ios-apple-facebook\">Memoji</a>.</p><p>Should VR headsets have a bulky battery mounted on your head, or should they rely on a tethered cable to a separate PC? Apple thinks there\u2019s a third option: slip the bulky battery in your back pocket, and run the cable up to a lighter, more comfortable set of goggles. It could work. Or it could be the worst of both worlds: a cable that still inhibits movement and comfort, with none of the power of a real tethered VR system. Hey, not all novelty is a slam-dunk.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/06/apples-3500-vr-headset-is-the-vision-pro-more-than-just-another-tech-toy-for-the-rich\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/06/apples-3500-vr-headset-is-the-vision-pro-more-than-just-another-tech-toy-for-the-rich", "date_published": "2023-06-06 10:43:21+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "\u2018Forget all the excuses\u2019: Arnold Schwarzenegger expresses regret over groping claims", "description": "<p>In the forthcoming documentary Arnold, the actor says of the historical allegations that \u2018it doesn\u2019t really matter what time it is \u2026 it was wrong\u2019</p><p>Arnold Schwarzenegger has revisited historical allegations of groping in a new documentary series about his life and career.</p><p>In 2003, shortly before his re-election as governor of California, the Los Angeles Times published a report detailing claims of groping by six women across three decades.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/06/arnold-schwarzenegger-expresses-regret-over-groping-claims\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/06/arnold-schwarzenegger-expresses-regret-over-groping-claims", "date_published": "2023-06-06 10:33:55+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "Climate risks are making California uninsurable.

Communication has become difficult and you are engaged in a power struggle. It is understandable that you feel angry and have a great deal of resentment towards him \u2013 which in itself will lower your desire for him. Your self-esteem is also suffering and no one likes to be ignored, so couples counselling with a good therapist who is knowledgable about sex therapy is going to be your best chance to have a more palatable relationship.

Kathleen Folbigg was convicted in 2003 of killing her four children, Caleb, Patrick, Sarah and Laura. It is now accepted that her children could quite possibly have died of natural causes. She was finally released from prison on Monday.</p><p>Folbigg was released because commissioner Tom Bathurst, who is conducting an inquiry into her convictions, has reached the \u201cfirm view\u201d that there is reasonable doubt about Folbigg\u2019s guilt. He has not yet completed his report, and this task should not be rushed. Instead, he has provided information to the New South Wales attorney general, Michael Daley, about why he has concluded that Folbigg is not guilty of killing her children. To his credit, the attorney general has moved quickly and decisively to pardon Folbigg.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/29/email-newsletters-guardian-australia-best-daily-news-emails-newsletter-free-sign-up-inbox-subscribe-headlines?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/29/email-newsletters-guardian-australia-best-daily-news-emails-newsletter-free-sign-up-inbox-subscribe-headlines?CMP=copyembed\"> </a><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/29/email-newsletters-guardian-australia-best-daily-news-emails-newsletter-free-sign-up-inbox-subscribe-headlines?CMP=copyembed\">email newsletters for your daily news roundup</a></strong></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/06/kathleen-folbigg-demonised-by-australia-legal-system-trial-pardon-release\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/06/kathleen-folbigg-demonised-by-australia-legal-system-trial-pardon-release", "date_published": "2023-06-06 03:00:29+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "\u2018No hate in her heart\u2019: Kathleen Folbigg laughed, drank Kahlua, mesmerised by technology in first night out of prison", "description": "<p>Folbigg\u2019s advocates now focused on getting convictions quashed when an inquiry into her case reports in coming weeks</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/jun/06/australia-news-live-reserve-bank-rba-interest-rates-decision-kathleen-folbigg-lawyers\">Follow our Australia news live blog for the latest updates</a></li><li>Get our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/29/email-newsletters-guardian-australia-best-daily-news-emails-newsletter-free-sign-up-inbox-subscribe-headlines?CMP=cvau_sfl\">morning and afternoon news emails</a>, <a href=\"https://app.adjust.com/w4u7jx3\">free app</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/full-story?CMP=cvau_sfl\">daily news podcast</a></li></ul><p>Tracy Chapman grinned widely as she recounted sitting down for dinner with her best friend, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/05/kathleen-folbigg-pardon-what-evidence-emerged-over-her-childrens-deaths-and-what-happens-next\">Kathleen Folbigg</a>, after 20 years.</p><p>The pair shared a pizza and garlic bread, washed down with a nostalgic Kahlua and Coke, on Folbigg\u2019s first night of freedom after being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/05/kathleen-folbigg-pardon-what-evidence-emerged-over-her-childrens-deaths-and-what-happens-next\">pardoned and released from jail.
