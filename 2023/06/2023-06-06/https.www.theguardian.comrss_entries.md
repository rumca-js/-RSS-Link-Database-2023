The Dnipro River used to be 300-400 metres away, but after the dam at Nova Kakhovka was breached at 2.50am on Tuesday, it has burst into the city, flooding the first two or three blocks of the lowest lying quarter.</p><p>Every half hour, Musian rises from her stool, carrying a square charcoal grey ruler. The water, she says, is rising “6 to 8cm every half hour” and is 3 metres above where it was before the dam burst. She phones through her figures to colleagues in the regional monitoring centre in nearby Mykolaiv.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/06/inhumane-and-dumb-ukrainians-on-suspected-russian-destruction-of-dam">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The country desperately needs a government prepared to invest big, to catch up with new economic times </p><p>Placing a speculative price tag on Labour party spending plans is, of course, a time-honoured pre-election manoeuvre by Conservative governments. In January 1992, as John Major seeded the ground for what turned out to be a fourth successive Tory victory later that year, voters were <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/background/pastelec/92keyiss.htm" title="">warned</a> of a “tax bombshell” costing the average taxpayer £1,000. The calculations were spurious but politically damaging.</p><p>A year or so away from the next election, the front-page headline in one <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12162745/Treasury-analysis-warns-Starmers-28BILLION-net-zero-strategy-drive-mortgage-costs.html" title="">newspaper</a> on Tuesday read: “Families face £1,000 a year bill for Labour eco plans”. Ministers are warning that the cost of the green strategy outlined by the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, would spook markets and drive up mortgage rates.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/06/the-guardian-view-on-labours-green-prosperity-plan-the-right-strategy-for-britain">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After 353 goals in 647 matches for the Spanish club, the France forward has proved he is one of the best to ever play the game</p><p>Fourteen years have passed since a car pulled up on Rue Youri Gagarine, Lyon, and the president of Real Madrid got out, but Karim Benzema can still picture it clearly. “You came to my home,” the Frenchman said on Tuesday morning as he said goodbye again, “and when I saw you, I thought: ‘This is the man that brought Zizou [Zinedine Zidane] and Ronaldo [Nazário] and he wants me in his team.’” It was 2009, Benzema was 21 and shy. He didn’t offer his visitor a drink, barely said a word and didn’t need much convincing to go but Florentino Pérez told him that he would become the best in the world and that Madrid was the place to do it.</p><p>Eventually, he got there. And now he has gone. It is only a few days since Benzema responded to reports of a departure by saying the internet isn’t always right and a couple since Carlo Ancelotti reminded everyone that his striker still had a contract at the Santiago Bernabéu, but there he was standing in the sports hall at the training ground and bidding farewell from a makeshift stage. He left Lyon; half a lifetime later, he departs the place that became home for longer than he could really have imagined but shorter than he had come to hope. “It’s a bit of a sad day,” he said. “I always said wanted to finish my career at Real Madrid but in life there are other opportunities.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/06/real-madrid-karim-benzema-france-zinedene-zidane-carlo-ancelotti-la-liga-champions-league">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The great American playwright, who made her Broadway debut last year aged 91, recounts what happened when she adapted a John Lennon book for Laurence Olivier’s National Theatre</p><p>In the mid-1960s, Beatlemania swept through the New York home of playwright Adrienne Kennedy. One of her sons, Adam, would sing I Want to Hold Your Hand; his older brother, Joedy, talked of the Fab Four as if they were the centre of his world. It was a tough time: Kennedy had just separated from the boys’ father and they were about to leave their apartment. But for the eldest child, “the Beatles were all that were on his mind,” she remembers. He treasured his copy of John Lennon’s book In His Own Write, a collection of poems and tales, which she read herself.</p><p>“Somewhere in those months of turmoil and Joedy’s passion” Kennedy decided to adapt the book as a play. It was a project that would take her to the heart of London’s theatreland and bring Kennedy both joy and pain. And, in a neat case of symmetry, she revisited this period of her life four decades later in her 2008 play Mom, How Did You Meet the Beatles? which is presented as a conversation with Adam. “He asked me again and again those questions,” she says. “Finally we decided he would tape my answers.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/06/adrienne-kennedy-on-meeting-the-beatles-american-playwright-john-lennon">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ice-free summers inevitable even with sharp emissions cuts and likely to result in more extreme heatwaves and floods</p><p>It is now too late to save summer Arctic sea ice, research has shown, and scientists say preparations need to be made for the increased extreme weather across the northern hemisphere that is likely to occur as a result.</p><p>Analysis shows that even if greenhouse gas emissions are sharply reduced, the Arctic will be ice-free in September in coming decades. The study also shows that if emissions decline slowly or continue to rise, the first ice-free summer could be in the 2030s, a decade earlier than previous projections.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/06/too-late-now-to-save-arctic-summer-ice-climate-scientists-find">Continue reading...</a>

## Singer-songwriter Hak Baker: ‘The old guard is being priced out of London’

<p>Time in prison helped the east Londoner reflect on his life. He’s now released a brilliant album that considers race, class solidarity – and the odd flirty, boozy night out</p><p>Hak Baker is harking back to the east London of his childhood, before the oat milk lattes and experiential advertising creatives moved in. “Old boys taking me boxing, or to the scrap yard to flip tyres for 40 quid: that stuff gave me a sense of belonging,” he says. “But now when I look out my window, it’s just not the same. That old guard is being priced out, and if you say hello to someone in the street, they look at you like you’re weird. That’s not where I came from. Not at all.”</p><p>Gentrification is one of the glum topics on the singer-songwriter’s debut album World’s End FM, alongside a host of others: colonialism, surveillance, depression. Then there are joyous songs like Doolally, where Baker flirts and boozes around a party sounding like the Streets on Fit But You Know It. Few other British albums this year are as vibrant, and true to life’s contradictions. “When people are low and it feels like world war three is on the balance, it’s hard to believe in yourself,” he says of its paradoxically cheery end-of-days vibe. “But if we’re all gonna die, I don’t want to spend the time being sad about it.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/06/singer-songwriter-hak-baker-the-old-guard-is-being-priced-out-of-london">Continue reading...</a>

## At least 100 million people are eligible to run for US president. Why are we left with Robert F Kennedy Jr? | Arwa Mahdawi

<p>There should be an inspiring field of candidates to choose from. But the latest to challenge for the Democratic nomination shows the options are severely limited</p><p>Robert F Kennedy Jr likes to talk to dead people. In a recent interview, the anti-vaccine activist, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/06/robert-kennedy-jr-announces-run-for-president-anti-vaccine-activist">who is challenging</a> President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination, said he talks to the dearly departed daily. “They are one-way prayers for strength and wisdom,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/01/robert-kennedy-jr-president-candidate-conspiracy">he later clarified</a>. “I get no strategic advice from the dead.”</p><p>It doesn’t seem as if he needs it. Kennedy, who is the nephew of the former President John F Kennedy and the son of the assassinated presidential hopeful Robert F Kennedy, is doing pretty well in the land of the living. While it is incredibly unlikely that the 69-year-old will wangle his way into the White House, his long-shot presidential campaign has gained momentum. According to a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/25/politics/cnn-poll-democrats-2024/index.html">recent CNN</a> poll, 20% of Democratic voters say they support RFK to be the party’s candidate and 64% say they would consider supporting him. That is well behind Biden (who came in at 60%) but nothing to sniff at. Particularly considering that Kennedy doesn’t have many policies, just a famous last name – and a penchant for spreading conspiracy theories and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/25/robert-kennedy-anne-frank-remarks-00002055">referencing Anne Frank</a> in offensive ways.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/06/at-least-100-million-people-are-eligible-to-run-for-us-president-why-are-we-left-with-robert-f-kennedy-jr">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Whether you choose a fruity, low-alcohol shrub or a classic cocktail for your outdoor celebrations, preparation is the key to success</p><ul><li>Got a culinary dilemma? Email <a href="mailto:feast@theguardian.com">feast@theguardian.com</a></li></ul><p><strong>What are the best drinks for a picnic?</strong><br /><em><strong>Rosie, London E11</strong></em><br />Picnic drinking (in moderation, of course) is a tricky business. First off, says Zoe Burgess, founder of drinks consultancy <a href="https://www.atelier-pip.com/">Atelier Pip</a> and author of <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-cocktail-cabinet-9781784727994">The Cocktail Cabinet</a>, there are the logistics (“How are you carrying everything?”), guests (“What do they like?”) and food (“What would pair well?”) to contend with. Then, warns Mark Diacono, author of <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/herb-9781787136359">Herb</a>, <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/spice-9781787136434">Spice</a> and <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/sour-9781787132269">Sour</a>, “you don’t want to premix something in which one element is fizzy and another sharp [think lemon or lime juice], because it will totally lose its sharpness over time.” And you <em>really</em> don’t want anything too potent – after all, Burgess says, “drinking in the day can take its toll”.</p><p>For all these reasons, shrubs (or drinking vinegars) are a good strategy, especially when the summer fruit glut arrives, Burgess says: “Pick your fruit, then heat it with caster sugar and verjus, which has a much softer acid balance than cider or white-wine vinegar.” Bottle it up and keep in the fridge or freezer, “ready to be topped with soda water and fresh lemon or lime juice” at your outdoor destination. Happily, shrubs pair well with vodka and gin, too, should the mood take you.</p><p>Got a culinary dilemma?

<p>As one of TV’s most iconic shows reaches two and a half decades in age, it’s still a masterclass in female-led TV – even if it could have been less focused on privileged white women</p><p>Twenty-five years ago, a big-haired, well-heeled sex columnist made her debut in a bold new comedy about women over 30 dating in New York. “It’s like the riddle of the Sphinx. Why are there so many great unmarried women, and no great unmarried men?” was the first question Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) pondered with her fellow single friends. “By the time you reach your 30s, you think, ‘Why should I settle?’” was corporate lawyer Miranda Hobbes’s (Cynthia Nixon) answer. “Most men are threatened by successful women,” added art dealer Charlotte York (Kristin Davis). “The right guy is an illusion; start living your life!” countered PR guru Samantha Jones (Kim Cattrall). And just like that, one of the best-ever female-led TV shows was born.</p><p>Women talking so frankly about what they want from sex and relationships was groundbreaking at the time; a quarter of a century on, it is folklore.

<p><strong>Waddesdon Manor, Buckinghamshire</strong><br />This lovingly crafted tower in Lord Rothschild’s grove is kitsch and beautiful – with glossy icing, dolphins, putti, mermaids and Cupids in crisp pastel colours. What a preposterous masterpiece!</p><p>Love doesn’t hurt at all in the woodland grove where Joana Vasconcelos has constructed a giant wedding cake. Cupids balance playfully on pedestals, water spurts from the mouths of dolphins and little statues of St Anthony bless newlyweds all around the tiled circumference of her 12m tall sculpture. Kitsch and beautiful, absurd and captivating, this may be the first wholeheartedly joyful artistic masterpiece of the 21st century.</p><p>You can go inside, passing between the electric candles and ceramic mermaids, to find a domed circular wedding chapel that pulses with bright colours, twisty columns and even more jaunty figures. This is a building with the irresponsibility of a work of art. You climb the stairs to the higher tiers of the “cake”, and find yourself suddenly above the trees in an impossibly light and heady place.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/06/joana-vasconcelos-wedding-cake-waddesdon-rothschild">Continue reading...</a>

## Americans want to join unions. The supreme court doesn’t like that | Moira Donegan

<p>Court’s new ruling makes it harder for workers to join a union, easier to break one and riskier to try to force concessions</p><p>Their contract had expired, so the local teamsters, drivers of concrete-mixing barrel trucks for a firm called Glacier Northwest, in Washington state, decided to walk off the job. Like all strikes, the point of the work stoppage was to inflict financial consequences on a recalcitrant management side: to show the bosses that their employees were united in shared interest and mutual protection and that it would cost them less money to negotiate in good faith and agree to the workers’ demands than to continue to fight the union for less favorable, more exploitative conditions. When the teamsters began their strike, 16 of the barrel mixing trucks were full. They drove them back to the Glacier Northwest lot and left them there.</p><p>But if you don’t mix concrete, it hardens, and becomes useless. If this happens in a barrel truck, sometimes that can cause damage to the truck, too. When Glacier Northwest realized that their teamster employees had gone on strike, non-union workers were able to remove the concrete over the course of five hours, averting damage to the trucks. But they lost the use of all the concrete that had been mixed in those 16 barrel trucks that day.</p><p>Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/06/unions-strike-us-supreme-court">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Henry Morris couldn’t be further from the Westminster bubble, but for years he has lampooned MPs online. He describes running rings around members of the House of Lords and using satire to bring down the government</p><p>Henry Morris should look a lot more stressed than he does, though it’s true that this is the first time I’ve met him (over Zoom), and he has such confident hair that it would be hard to see uncertainty beneath it. “Everyone seems to be preoccupied with my mullet,” he agrees. His wife, Ellie, is two days past her due date so their second child could show up at any minute. Into that happy but high-stakes scene, Morris dropped a hand grenade last Wednesday: a video revealing that the Secret Tory, a Twitter account lampooning Conservatives from a thousand directions, has been him all along.</p><p>Since its inception in 2019, the account – which now has nearly 200,000 followers – has been the focus of magnetised speculation: “Retired anonymous Conservative MP, part-time arms dealer” was how he described himself, though everyone knew that wasn’t <em>real</em>-real. He would tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/secrettory12/status/1582456666678734849">imagined WhatsApp messages between ministers</a>, Alice in Wonderland fantasias that disappeared into the wilds of Liz Truss’s ignorance and Jacob Rees-Mogg’s creepiness. Or he would write <a href="https://twitter.com/secrettory12/status/1295611575433338881">accounts of Conservative chaos</a> in the style of Swift or Chaucer. Nobody was in any doubt that it was parody, but somehow, between the dense and granular detail, and the playful, insidery tone, people thought he was very close to the action; a special adviser, maybe? At the very least, Westminster-bubble-based. Lots of Conservative MPs were following him on Twitter; people started to slide into his DMs to congratulate him on a point well landed, or make suggestions.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/06/the-secret-tory-unmasked-my-one-objective-to-destroy-the-tories">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘More tram-spotting than Trainspotting’: the new tram linking Leith to Edinburgh

<p>The tramline to the old port means its Michelin-starred restaurants, seafront and cool venues are now just a few stops away from Edinburgh city centre</p><p>‘Leith is changing. Bars are becoming bistros, and barbers are opening with bars in them,” says walking guide <a href="http://www.edinburghstreettours.co.uk/">Paul Stewart</a>, founder of Edinburgh Street Tours. He points to the new tram station atop Leith Walk and says, “It feels more tram-spotting than Trainspotting,” a reference to the drug-addled 90s black comedy written by Leith-born Irvine Welsh. Stewart is not complaining as he used to survive on the streets of this old port where, in the 1980s, half the unemployed had been jobless for over a year. It was no accident that Leithers the Proclaimers used Leith as the video backdrop for their damning riposte to Thatcherite Scotland, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yy9GmieAEaQ">Letter from America</a>.</p><p>I’ve come to explore this Edinburgh district ahead of the new tramline launching on Wednesday. Trams opened connecting the city centre to Edinburgh airport back in 2014, with the last stop at York Place. It’s taken the best part of a decade for the line to forge down Leith Walk into Leith proper and on to the waterfront at Newhaven. It’s a run of just 2.91 miles and eight new stops – but its arrival brings palpable hope.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/jun/06/new-tram-leith-to-edinburgh-food-drink-guide">Continue reading...</a>

Out of contract this summer, Messi faces a late career crossroads <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/03/lionel-messi-to-leave-psg-barcelona-al-hilal">with three options in front of him</a> – an emotional return to Barcelona, a switch that could be worth $1bn to Saudi Arabia or a move to Major League Soccer.

On Monday, his father said his son “would love to return to Barcelona”, while the hundreds of millions the Saudis are offering would tempt even someone as ludicrously wealthy as Messi. Having said that, MLS hasn’t pursued a player this aggressively since David Beckham was lured to the league back in 2007. Like Beckham, Messi is a player who would move the needle in the USA and Canada. He could kickstart a new phase of growth for MLS, and the sport in general, in the run-up to the 2026 World Cup on North American soil. Inter Miami, however, aren’t doing much for the sales pitch.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/06/inter-miami-would-be-a-dubious-landing-spot-for-lionel-messi">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A teenage son wants to follow his a legendary storm-tracker dad’s footsteps – with the late lamented Anne Heche sparky in one of her final roles</p><p>Every generation needs its own VFX-heavy action thriller about storm-chasing meteorology nerds and there hasn’t really been one since Twister in 1996. (Admittedly, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/21/into-the-storm-review">Into the Storm arrived back in 2014</a>, but no one remembers that.) A supercell, by the way, is a mega-huge tornado-thunderstorm weather event that the Brody family – dad Bill (Richard Gunn), his wife Quinn (Anne Heche, in what was sadly to be one of her last roles) and Bill’s brother Roy (Skeet Ulrich) – gets frightfully excited about. Bill and Roy chase storms like this all over Texas and Oklahoma in a gas-guzzling truck while Quinn stays home monitoring satellite feeds and screaming into a shortwave radio when she’s not looking after her and Bill’s son William.</p><p>Of course, like Icarus but with cowboy boots, Bill gets too close to the killing end of a storm and dies. Quinn is so bereaved that, despite Roy describing her as one of the smartest people he’s ever known, she takes up cleaning houses for a living, as if this is the most humiliating line of work anyone could ever be in. William grows up to be a strapping lad played by Daniel Diemer who worships the memory of his father. When Roy sends Bill’s old journal as a keepsake to William, he runs off to meet up with his uncle and rejoin the business, which has since been bought by greedy, reckless capitalist Zane (Alec Baldwin), who now uses the truck and equipment to run storm tours for tourists. The kid unsurprisingly proves to be a natural at storm-tracking. But wait, what’s that dark cloud-formation on the horizon? Could it be … a supercell???</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/06/supercell-review-storms-anne-heche-daniel-diemer">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Grief, injustice and cruelty dominate the Irish poet’s essential debut, a collection shot through with wisdom and a hint of magic</p><p>Majella Kelly has found a subject to suit her voice – and what a voice it is, charged with images of Ireland that transport you there for better or worse, in sickness and in health, and in deepest trouble. The subject that dominates this not-to-be-missed debut is the discovery of an infant mass grave in Tuam, County Galway, the existence of which was only officially acknowledged in 2017. The wretched tale is that from 1925-1961, “fallen women” were sent to the inappropriately named <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/03/mass-grave-of-babies-and-children-found-at-tuam-orphanage-in-ireland">Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home</a>, run by nuns. Exactly how so many babies failed to survive is not clear but injustice, cruelty and grief surge through the poems. At the same time and strangely, even at their darkest, there is at times a fairytale quality to this writing – magic in its margins.</p><p>The title suggests a readiness for a good gossip but while <a href="https://www.majellakelly.com/home-1">Kelly </a>is captivatingly conversational, she is preoccupied by what it means for women to be silenced. Voice is about one of the unmarried mothers gagged by shame – and Kelly’s sureness of touch is evident in the accurate rurality of “cut nettles in empty cups”, as anyone who has uprooted a nettle and witnessed its speedy wilt can confirm. The final lines of the poem are frightening in their crematorial helplessness: “But when I opened my mouth to cry out,/I spoke only in a thin grey wisp of smoke.” The plain simplicity of the nouns is exactly right (nettles, fireplace, smoke) – she does not get in the way of her subject. Elsewhere, though, there are poems that possibly over-tell the scandalous story. Clean begins: “Dead is the happiest we ever were…” The line’s authoritative flow cannot override the bitter falseness of the attestation – death being no happiness at all. And there are times when Kelly is over-reliant on lists of nouns such as strings of beads, poetic rosaries – although at their best (especially in I Am From) these have their uses.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/06/the-speculations-of-country-people-by-majella-kelly-review-crimes-and-punishment">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Midfielder will leave in the summer with club’s best wishes, especially if they win their first European trophy for 58 years</p><p>Around West Ham, there is zero bitterness at the thought of their most cherished talent moving on this summer. They have been crucial to Declan Rice’s progression into one of the best midfielders in the world, giving him a chance after he made a tearful exit from Chelsea at the age of 14, but the clock has been ticking all season. The mood is one of acceptance rather than anger and if there is regret it has to end this way any pain will surely float away if Rice’s final game for West Ham brings them their first major trophy for 43 years.</p><p>There are ways to say goodbye to the club that made you. The exit beckons, but so does immortality in the East End. So does the chance to follow in the footsteps of the great Bobby Moore, the only player to captain West Ham to a European trophy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/06/declan-rice-one-grand-final-farewell-west-ham-europa-conference-league-final">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The 18-year-old former TikToker has been gaming a system created by his supposed elders and betters</p><p>When I first came across <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/30/tiktoker-mizzy-granted-bail-in-care-of-his-mother">Mizzy</a>, now infamous as the “TikTok Terror”, it was in videos of him being chased by security after breaking into Alton Towers or riding an electric bike into a Sainsbury’s. He seemed annoying in a “kids these days!” kind of way, and I didn’t think much of it. But fast-forward a few months and Mizzy’s videos – his real name is Bacari-Bronze O’Garro – went to a very dark place indeed. The 18-year-old has provoked outrage for his abhorrent TikTok videos, which have seen him abduct an elderly woman’s dog, attempt to<strong> </strong>leapfrog over an Orthodox Jewish man, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/26/police-re-arrest-tiktoker-mizzy-who-filmed-himself-entering-strangers-home">enter a stranger’s home</a> without permission, and walk up to young people at night and ask<strong> </strong>if they “want to die”. He has since apologised, but you can only imagine the shocking and disturbing effect this “content” must have had on those involved.</p><p>Looking back on it, it almost seems as if this escalation in videos was built into the system: illicit bike rides aren’t enough to sustain the internet’s attention, you have to up your prank game and really force people to watch. Now bewildered and angry people across Britain have been understandably left with a series of questions.

<p>The views of the former Labour minister make for jarring moments in this latest volume of his diaries</p><p>It’s always hard for a beloved actor to know when to leave the stage. So no wonder that political diarist Chris Mullin was tempted by one last encore, covering the dozen years from his leaving parliament in 2010. Three terrific previous volumes had already established this campaigning journalist turned Labour minister as one of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/mar/19/bill-blanko-chris-mullin">great political diarists</a>, proof that it is not the big beasts but their wickedly observant juniors who often offer the most incisive take. Doubtless he was inspired, too, by his friend <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/03/tony-benn-autumn-sunshine-last-diaries-review">Tony Benn’s late memoir </a><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/03/tony-benn-autumn-sunshine-last-diaries-review">A Blaze of Autumn Sunshine</a></em>, whose title he borrows to describe the bliss of semi-retired life.</p><p>The fourth instalment opens gently enough with Mullin living in rural Northumberland, still keeping up intermittently with old friends both Labour and Tory: a legal battle with the police, over his determination to protect the sources for his groundbreaking 1980s reporting on the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/26/why-the-birmingham-six-story-must-not-be-forgotten">wrongful convictions of the so-called Birmingham Six</a>, adds a frisson of drama. But these days he observes politics from a distance, in between tending the garden. (“<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/24/theresa-may-steps-down-resigns-tory-leader-conservative-brexit">Theresa May has at last announced her intention to resign</a>.

<p>Mr Z has developed a taste for extreme food prep content. The footage is disgusting and has ruined his algorithm</p><p>I’ve worked pretty hard to ban the use of Facebook in the household, not because of the threat it poses to democracy, nor because I’m worried about privacy or data or whatnot, but because it makes us look old. The kids don’t use it, obviously, because they’re not old. Mr Z has historically been susceptible to “six years ago today” nostalgia jags, and posting pictures of us on holiday that make it look as though everyone’s getting on better than they are. I’ve worked pretty hard to stamp that out, and if nixing Facebook means we miss the odd event of other people who are also old, I’m OK with that.</p><p>What I can’t do is stop him watching food videos. It is a very distinct genre; I don’t know how you’d land on it by accident, except maybe if you typed into Google “the most disgusting thing anyone’s ever eaten”. A guy, often with only his arms visible, probably with sleeve tattoos, will get a gigantic piece of meat and fashion it into an unnatural shape, usually a rectangle. Then he’ll layer it into a tower, spliced with cheese, and wrap it in more meat. Somehow egg yolks will get involved, then additional cheese. It’s all a bit sped up, and mesmerising. I don’t know where the suspense comes from – what could it possibly taste like? Who would ever eat it? Why did an animal – sorry, eight animals – have to die for this? When is karma going to get involved and exact some retribution upon the mozzarella dude? These questions are never answered.

The campaign by more than 50 Tory MPs and the Telegraph to abolish inheritance tax is a prime example.

Surely, therefore, it will work again in the Conservatives’ hour of desperate need?</p><p>This time, Labour is not spooked. Far from it. Nothing could be more comic than the multimillionaire Nadhim Zahawi leading this campaign, the man whose only memorable moment in his brief chancellorship was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/29/nadhim-zahawi-sacked-tory-party-chair-tax-affairs-rishi-sunak">being sacked </a>for failing to declare an ongoing investigation into his personal tax affairs.

## Charlotte Higgins on The Archers: stray virgins better watch out in pagan Ambridge!

<p>It’s only a small step from ‘beating the bounds’ to full-on Wicker Man – and Clarrie and Susan certainly have the skills required</p><p>George Grundy – 17, full of ambition and lacking any kind of moral compass – is well on his way to becoming king of the world, aided and abetted by arch-capitalist Martyn Gibson. That’s despite being put to rights at Berrow Farm by the implacable Hannah, who’s had him cleaning out the pig pens (he certainly knows how to make a broom sound like it’s being wielded with maximum passive aggression).</p><p>Tracy Horrobin is no one’s fool and sees straight through George. So it was that things nearly got messy between her and George’s boastful mum, Emma, at the former’s hen do. I had visions of Tracy employing her Azerbaijani wrestling skills, developed but alas not used for the Ambridge Eurovision talent competition, to take out her niece once and for all. I wouldn’t put it past Tracy – after all, she used her considerable strength to fling Jazzer violently against the dresser during their rehearsals. After which he stormed off, had a few drinks, and rather bizarrely got himself run over by a person driving an electric car. Ambridge really is a road-traffic-accident hotspot when you think about it – Blake run over by Chelsea, Matt Crawford mown down by the late Nic Grundy, John Archer slain back in the day by an overturned tractor.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/06/charlotte-higgins-on-the-archers-stray-virgins-better-watch-out-in-pagan-ambridge">Continue reading...</a>

## Transformers: Rise of the Beasts review – limp, lifeless robot sequel

<p>An attempt to revive the Hasbro franchise is a careless fumble put together without a hint of effort or interest</p><p>During his tenure as chairman of the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation, industrialist Lee Iacocca declared the small hunk of land off the coast of New Jersey a “symbol of reality” to Lady Liberty’s “symbol of hope”. A fitting gesture, then, that Ellis Island should be obliterated as collateral damage in the first hour of Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, in light of its deafening disregard for anything in the general galaxy of real.</p><p>As obligatory human Noah Diaz (Anthony Ramos, looking like he’s just walked into a party and realized he doesn’t know anyone) stumbles through a cosmic clash between opposing hunks of dinged-up CGI, he briefly questions the need of alien robots to disguise themselves as Earth-faring vehicles. His perfectly valid thoughts are hand-waved away by Mirage – voiced by Pete Davidson, saying things like “yo!” – with the instruction not to worry about it. It behooves a viewer to set their suspension of disbelief at a generously accommodating looseness in dealing with a film featuring Airazor, the extraterrestrial cybernetic eagle that speaks in the voice of Michelle Yeoh. But all parties involved with the production deliver a level of effort suggesting that these Saturday morning implausibilities have been seized as cover and cause to not give a shit.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/05/transformers-rise-of-the-beasts-review-sequel">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An impending appointment at Spurs has been met with near universal acclaim in his home country, although the coach is not without faults</p><p>Ange Postecoglou will finally get an opportunity to exact revenge on Manchester United. Just over 23 years after Quinton Fortune’s brace condemned his South Melbourne team to a 2-0 defeat in the 2000 Fifa Club World Championship at the Maracanã, the Australian is set to become a Premier League manager, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/05/tottenham-agree-contract-with-ange-postecoglou-manager-celtic">with Tottenham expected to offer a two-year contract with an option for a further season</a>.</p><p>Reaction to Postecoglou’s impending appointment in north London has been mixed among Tottenham fans, even if it has become somewhat more favourable as the doubters learn more beyond the information on his Wikipedia page. In contrast, back in Australia, where he arrived from Greece as a five-year-old in 1970, there is almost universal acclaim for the man who will become the country’s first coach to take charge of a Premier League team.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jun/06/ange-postecoglou-to-tottenham-australia-revels-in-rise-of-its-first-premier-league-manager">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The government has launched legal action to prevent the independent Covid inquiry demanding disclosure of thousands of WhatsApp messages. What does it have to hide, asks Aubrey Allegretti</p><p>Next week the first full hearings will take place for the UK’s Covid-19 inquiry. It is expected to last at least three years and cover everything from the government’s preparedness for pandemics to the conduct of those responding to it and lessons that could be learned for next time a deadly virus must be contained.</p><p>As the Guardian political correspondent <strong>Aubrey Allegretti </strong>tells <strong>Michael Safi, </strong>the aims of the inquiry itself have become clouded in recent days by an unedifiying row between the government and the inquiry’s chair over who gets to decide what information is relevant and in the public interest to examine. With the Cabinet Office arguing to hold back contents of WhatsApp group chats, Boris Johnson waded in and offered to hand over all of his material, hailing a need for transparency – and in the process dropping his former colleague, Rishi Sunak, into a row about allegations of a cover-up.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/jun/06/what-is-the-uk-government-hiding-from-the-covid-inquiry-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
