Narrated by Gabriel Moss.\nTransformers: Rise of the Beasts proves that Bumblebee wasn\u2019t a fluke, and that the Transformers series is finally accelerating in the right direction. Steven Caple Jr. oversees a solid balance between paint-by-numbers intergalactic doomsday storytelling and entertainment-first Transformers action, even though it never achieves the epic scope it\u2019s aiming for and the human side of the story can\u2019t keep up with the robots. There\u2019s a focus on a story with heart and heroics, and that\u2019s never lost thanks to reigning in Michael Bay\u2019s brand of sensationalist chaos. Rise of the Beasts returns to Transformers basics on a larger scale than Bumblebee, but never gets too big for its britches. It feels like playing with Autobots and Maximals action figures in your backyard on a weekend, lost in a smashy-fun adventure that might not save the galaxy, but is a good enough excuse to watch robots turn into cars and fight for a few hours.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsMea39II6U", "date_published": "2023-06-06 04:00:10+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Xbox Showcase Won't Have Any Full CG Trailers for First-Party Games - IGN Daily Fix", "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nAhead of their upcoming Xbox Showcase, Microsoft is promising that any first-party games shown won't be full CG trailers. While that doesn't necessarily mean we'll get nothing but gameplay, it is a promising sign that the games featured are relatively far along in production. In Diablo news, the game has been out for mere days and some players have already hit Level 100. A hardcore few are almost to Level 100 in Hardcore Mode, the mode that deletes your character if you die. And speaking of Diablo, its first big patch is making changes to some of the classes in order to achieve better balance. In other news, indie Metroidvania hit Dead Cells has surpassed 10 million in sales. The developer has more content for the game planned through 2025. And finally, EA Sports hasn't forgotten about NFTs, even if the rest of the gaming world is trying to. They'll be adding the Nike Swoosh to some of its games, and it can be used by players to customize certain aspects, like uniforms.
