  <p id="5H158v">Apple has acquired Mira, a Los Angeles-based AR startup that makes headsets for other companies and the US military, according to a post from the CEO’s private Instagram account yesterday seen by <em>The Verge </em>and a person familiar with the matter. Apple confirmed the acquisition.</p>
<p id="tYWb66">The news comes just one day after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/5/23738968/apple-vision-pro-ar-headset-features-specs-price-release-date-wwdc-2023">Apple unveiled the Vision Pro</a>, a $3,499 mixed reality headset that the company has billed as a new “spatial” computing platform. It’s unclear how much Apple paid for Mira, which raised about $17 million in funding to date. Jony Ive, Apple’s former design chief, was an advisor to the startup at one point, according to two former employees who requested anonymity to speak without the company’s permission.</p>

<p id="6TmrpW">When their deaths do make headlines, we don’t often learn much about their lives. In many cases, even names and gender are missing from reports.

  <p id="7mEFIE">Five minutes into Google’s I/O conference in May, <em>Verge</em> staffers started taking bets on how many times “AI” would be mentioned onstage. It seemed like every presenter had to say it at least once or get stuck with a cattle prod by Sundar Pichai. (In the end, we stopped betting and made a <a href="https://twitter.com/verge/status/1656354548703719427">supercut</a>.) Watching WWDC, though, the book ran in the opposite direction: would anyone from Apple mention “AI” <em>at all</em>? It turns out, no, not even once. </p>
<p id="xupT2K">The technology was referred to, of course, but always in the form of “machine learning” — a more sedate and technically accurate description. As many working in the field itself will tell you, “artificial intelligence” is a much-hated term: both imprecise and overdetermined, more reminiscent of sci-fi...</p>
