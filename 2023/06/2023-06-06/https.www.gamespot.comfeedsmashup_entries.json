Now, over 15 years later, we are about to see yet another new Transformers movie. This time, though, they're finally bringing Beast Wars to the big screen. Transformers: Rise of the Beasts will no doubt introduce a slew of new Autobots to the existing army of good guy alien robots. Before we see that, though, it's important to remember all of the ridiculously cool robots we've already gotten in these films.</p><p>It should come as no surprise that, ultimately, the Transformers franchise is the story of good and evil playing out over and over, with the good side emerging victorious every single time. Given that, we decided to put the spotlight on the Autobots. These intergalactic heroes have battled the force of evil and saved humanity time and again, even when humans made it clear they wanted nothing to do with the massive robots.</p><p>Take a look at our breakdown of every Autobot in the live-action franchise--and a ride based on the movies--thus far. And when you get to the end of the list, don't worry too much. While we haven't had a new film since 2018's Bumblebee, there will surely be another Transformers movie at some point. After all, the series has made nearly $5 billion worldwide at this point, so there's certainly still interest in the property.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Optimus Prime</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1561/15611758/3241259-optimus-prime.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">First appearance: Transformers</p><p dir=\"ltr\">As the leader of the Autobots -- and the most popular Transformer -- it's no surprise that Optimus Prime has been around since the beginning.

In addition to the fine, Microsoft will now also have to make several changes that improve privacy protection for children on Xbox.</p><p>\"Our proposed order makes it easier for parents to protect their children's privacy on Xbox, and limits what information Microsoft can collect and retain about kids,\" FTC Bureau of Consumer Protection boss <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/06/ftc-will-require-microsoft-pay-20-million-over-charges-it-illegally-collected-personal-information\">Samuel Levine said</a>. \"This action should also make it abundantly clear that kids' avatars, biometric data, and health information are not exempt from COPPA.\"</p><p>The issue stemmed from the process that was required when signing up for an Xbox Live account, which Microsoft only changed in late 2021. Signing up for an Xbox Live account required personal data such as a full name, email address, and a date of birth, and even if your date of birth showed that you were 13 years of age or under, Microsoft would still require more details. Until 2019, the process also included a pre-checked box indicating that you had accepted to receive promotional material and provide Microsoft with data that it would send to advertisers.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-must-pay-us-government-20-million-over-xbox-privacy-violations/1100-6514834/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-must-pay-us-government-20-million-over-xbox-privacy-violations/1100-6514834/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-06-06 13:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Captain America 4 Gets A New Title And Teaser Photo With Harrison Ford", "description": "<p>Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) assumed the mantle of Captain America in the Disney+ series The Falcon and The Winter Solider, replacing the appointed John Walker (Wyatt Russell)--who then became US Agent.

For the first 45 minutes to an hour, we get the most compelling and relatable version yet of the story about a regular person accidentally becoming friends with an alien robot who was secretly a car. But then the plot really kicks in, and suddenly we're watching a Michael Bay Transformers movie--but without Bay's skill as an action filmmaker.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">When Michael Bay was directing Transformers movies, they weren't exactly pinnacles of storytelling. In fact, they had awful stories that never even made sense together--each new movie would open with some reveal that made every previous movie make even less sense than they already did. But they were also Michael Bay movies, which means that (aside from Revenge of the Fallen) they had tons of extremely dope action and generally looked sick as hell even during the non-action parts.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Rise of the Beasts, from Creed II director Steven Caple Jr, doesn't look <em>terrible</em> or anything like that. It just looks like a generic big-budget, CGI-heavy affair. There's no flair, no signature to it. And so it's a major problem that the story is bad, because the filmmaking doesn't elevate the experience to make up for that.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/transformers-rise-of-the-beasts-review-robots-in-decline/1900-6418076/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/transformers-rise-of-the-beasts-review-robots-in-decline/1900-6418076/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-06-06 04:01:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
