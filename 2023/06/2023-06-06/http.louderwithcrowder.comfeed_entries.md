Presenting evidence that wildin' out in supermarkets is a global phenomenon while introducing a nominee for mother of the year seems like an excellent excuse to return to the region. There was a sale on catching these hands at Woolworths. Or, not so much catching these hands as much as pulling this hair.</p><p>You know. Girl fight.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Though for a change, the star of the show was not the two main combatants. Not to sleep on either one of them. They both were pulling each other's shirts off, one gal's black bra could barely contain her chesticles, and I'm a child.</p><p>The hero -- or maybe villain -- was the woman who handed off her baby to a stranger. At least, I hope it was a stranger. It makes the story better if it was a stranger.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>Here's where it gets a little confusing. Obviously, the mother can't get involved if she is holding her baby. That's not safe for the baby. The baby has to be given to someone. I can understand handing your baby to a stranger if it was your friend getting attacked and needing backup.</p><p>This woman handed off her kid to start throwing bombs on some random woman who wasn't involved.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>Giving your baby to a stranger to save your friend makes you a good mother AND a good friend. Giving a baby to a stranger because you were feeling froggy and you didn't like some broad's face? That might warrant a call to CPS. Or, whatever NSW's version of CPS is.</p><p>Maybe it's something in the water in that region, or maybe the girls are all synced up. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/melbourne-cup-walkway-fight" target="_blank">Because they never seem to need a reason</a>. Please join me in a prayer to the deity or deities of content that we get an update on the investigation.,</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Elliot Page shares unbelievable story about being trans-bashed in Los Angeles that's... unbelievable

He was leaving a hotel in Los Angeles where two people in MAGA hats showed up out of nowhere proclaiming Los Angeles as MAGA country and yelling "hey, aren't you that f*ggot from 'Juno'" before pouring bleach on him and tying a noose around his neck. Or, something like that.</p><p>Elliot hasn't been doing much. ELLEN Page was all over the place. You might remember her as <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/watch-actress-ellen-page-tries-to-corner-ted-cruz-on-lgbt-issues-gets-owned" target="_blank">an insufferable actress</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jussie-smollett-brothers-support-trump" target="_blank">anti-Christian bigot</a>. Now that Ellen is Elliot, he can be whatever he wants to be and is sharing these new stories with <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2023-06-04/for-real-elliot-page-survival-pageboy-umbrella-academy?fbclid=PAAabljJY_1EyODzdtcVyY1yInSjCyaUnCOw6H9VnaHpXRn_3tEZ_fBtSa5w4" target="_blank">the Los Angeles Times</a>.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="9395a" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33810437&amp;width=980" />
</p><h3>What's this about Los Angeles?</h3><br /><p>According to Elliot, when he transitioned from Ellen, not everyone was as open-minded and tolerant as he would like. That includes when Page was in such backward, bigoted, conservative areas like *checks notes* downtown Los Angeles.</p><p>This is the story Elliot tells (that is being used to promote Elliot's new book about transitioning from Ellen). One day at the corner of Sunset and La Cienega...</p><blockquote>“I’m going to f—ing gay bash you, f—t,” the man threatened. Terrified, Page began running toward the Pink Dot, where employees ushered him inside. From the other side of the door, the man yelled: “This is why I need a gun!”</blockquote><p>Far be it from to deny someone speaking their truth. But a gun lover who verbalizes verbatim "I am going to gay bash you" sounds a little TOO on the nose.</p><p>Let me put it like this. Say, for sake of argument,  I told you I was standing on the corner of DeSantis and Trump in Texarkana, Texas. When out of nowhere a drag queen came up to me, "Hi, I am going to groom your son. By the way, she's your daughter now. And I'm banging her public school kindergarten teacher who talks about it all the time in class." </p><p>You would tell me you didn't believe me.</p><h3>Is it me, or does Ellen...err, I mean ELLIOT'S story so familiar</h3><br /><p>
	It is not just you.
</p><div class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" style="display: flex; width: 100%; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"></div> <p>
	Many are drawing comparisons of the Jussie Smollett saga. In 2019, Jussie claimed he was attacked by Trump supporters in the southside of Chicago--yes, Trump supporters in the southside of Chicago--who called him anti-gay and anti-black slurs, put a noose around his neck, and poured bleach on him.</p><p>It was a little TOO perfect. But that didn't stop celebrities Ellen (he was Ellen then) from running with it.  After all, why would any decent human being lie about such a heinous crime?</p><p>As we now know, Jussie was not a decent human. And the reason he would do it is because<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jussie-smollett-trial-update" target="_self"> he knew the media would fall for it and uncritically believe him</a>.</p><p>But Jussie wasn't selling a book. He was only looking to get more money out of TV show producers.</p>

</p>
<p><br /></p><p>I'm sure Elliot is telling the truth, though. I wish them the best in xir new life. And whoever this mystery LA transphobe is, I hope they (I wouldn't want to misgender) feel bad and have thought long and hard about what they did.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Listen: PETA VP tries to puppy shame Pete Davidson, so he leaves a voice message telling her "suck my d***"

<img src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/pete-davison-leaves-obscene-voice-message-for-peta-vice-president-tmz.png?id=33809890&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0" /><br /><br /><p>Getting a dog should be a happy time in any man's life. For Pete Davidson, that day was ruined by a yappy animal right activists. So Skeete did what anyone would do in that situation. He invited the woman to put her mouth on his weiner. Then, he made the suggestion she might smile more if she fornicated herself.</p><p><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2023/06/06/pete-davidson-leaves-peta-unhinged-voice-mail-new-dog-backlash/" target="_blank">The news was broken by TMZ</a>. Because if you're a vice president of PETA and have a voice message of Pete Davidson telling you to take a mouthful of his penis, you're not going to call CNN with it.</p><p><br /></p><h3>Wow, that escalated quickly</h3><br /><p>
	Pete Davidson had to say goodbye to his dog Henry earlier this month. As he was scrolling Instagram, he saw a Cavapoo that he fell in love with. He contacted the store and welcomed the new member into his family.
</p> <p>
	The problem, or "problem" is he went to a store and not a shelter. PETA, when they aren't <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-chocolate-milk" target="_blank">shaming Elon Musk for chocolate milk</a> or <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/peta-animal-based-insults" target="_blank">shaming you for using animal-based insults</a>, they're lecturing potential dog owners to "adopt and not shop."
</p><p>
	Daphna Nachminovitch, the Senior VP of Cruelty Investigations, <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2023/06/05/pete-davidson-new-dog-peta-upset-animal-shelter/" target="_blank">issued a statement</a>: "It's tragic that Pete didn’t seek out a borough-born mutt from a city animal shelter, because a scrappy New Yorker with charm, personality, and unconventional handsomeness could have been his perfect match."
</p><h3>"Hi, my name is Pete Davidson"</h3><br /><p>
	Pete was quite put off by PETA's attack. He called the vice-president to educate her that he's allergic to dogs and needs to get a specific breed, like a Cavapoo. The actor was dismayed PETA would be so cruel and ruin this happy moment for him and his girlfriend.
</p><p>
	Then came the reason the call was leaked to TMZ:
</p><p>

</p><blockquote>
	So why don't you do you research before f*cking creating news stories for people because you're a boring, tired BEEP. F*ck you, and suck my d*ck.
</blockquote><p>
	I had to write BEEP because I legit can't figure out what he said. The word sounded like it started with the letter "c," so feel free to insert any c-words you think would fit. I don't want to misquote Davidson. He's been through enough.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="eabc3" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33810173&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>Davidson has since calmed down. In a statement to TMZ he said he was already feeling a certain way about the loss of Henry and the store filming him without permission. He admits it was a poor choice of words -- the whole d*ck sucking thing -- "but I am not sorry for standing up for myself and my family."</p><p>Davidson now needs to think of a new name for his new friend. Daphna Nachminovitch learned a valuable lesson in minding her own beeswax.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Target gets smacked with another downgrade as new details of their political agenda reveal it's not just about "pride"

	Target is in competition with Anheuser-Busch to see what once popular brand can go the most broke by getting woke. AB lost $26 billion dollars after <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/captiv8-bud-light-dylan-mulvaney" target="_blank">a marketing exec chose a TikTok influencer over their loyal client base</a>. Target is right behind them not only down $15 billion but with a new stock downgrade and a fresh look at the radical progressive political organizations the retailer sends money to.
</p><p>
	Hint: it's money they make off of your purchases.
</p><h3>Another downgrade</h3><br /><p>
	Last Friday, Target was downgraded by JP Morgan. The bank barely mentioned the “recent company controversies” while focusing more on families having less discretionary income. Now, KeyBanc Capital Markets <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/target-shares-hit-downgrade" target="_blank">has downgraded the stock to "sector weight" from "overweight."</a> In layman's terms (kinda) they went from a SELL to a HOLD.
</p><p>
	KeyBanc claims the move is because "the resumption of student loan payments stipulated by Congress’ debt ceiling agreement poses a sizable headwind for discretionary spending for shoppers, which has an elevated discretionary sales mix and a younger, college-educated core consumer demographic."
</p><p>Funny, I don't remember all these stock downgrades when Biden Inflation and the Biden Supply Chain Crisis were also wreaking havoc on discretionary income. People still found a way to spend the little money they did have at Target.</p><p>Yet now...</p><h3>Target hates Mr. Rushmore</h3><br /><p>Part of the problem Bud Light and now Target is facing is that average, apolitical Americans are waking up to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/target-diversity-inclusion" target="_blank">how much these corporations hate them</a>. And it's <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/target-pride-collection" target="_blank">not just the Pride stuff</a>. It's now being discovered Target sends hefty donations to Marxist political organizations. </p><p><a href="https://nypost.com/2023/06/05/target-funds-group-that-wants-to-close-mt-rushmore-over-white-supremacy/" target="_blank">They donated to something called the NDN Collective</a>. It is unclear how much, but the Collective shook down $50 million in grants in 2021. Why, yes. This is in the wake of the 2020 riots. How ever did you guess?<br /></p><p>What does Target support through their donation made possible by your overspending?</p><ul><li>Shutting down Mt. Rushmore, which they consider a "symbol of white supremacy."</li><li>Condemning the US military.</li><li>Being anti-Israel, using the terror slogan, “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.”</li></ul><p>Does any of that support YOUR values? Something to think about when you are shopping for 4th of July swag at the store.</p><p>It's easy to focus on Pride. After all, it's June when our government orders us to celebrate the Ls, Gs, Bs, especially the Ts, Qs, As, Is, other Is, Ps, and whatever the hell the pluses are. Then doesn't care from July to May. But these corporations support the radical progressive left twelve months a year. Keep that in mind when you decide where to spend your money, and how much of it you really need to spend.</p><p><p><em>Facebook doesn't want you reading this post or any others lately.

## Stephen A. Smith demands a new president after Biden's latest public embarrassment: "Someone has to say it"

Smith sometimes agrees with us and sometimes doesn't. On his latest podcast, he found common ground with conservatives on the ground we most find common. Joe Biden is too f*cking old to be president. But like many on the left who agrees, we disagree on the solution.</p><p>Smith brings up the latest public presidential embarrassment. Joe Biden, whose brain is at least 51% tapioca at this point, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-sandbag-cnn-doctor" target="_blank">falling down in public again</a>. To paraphrase modern philosophers Chumbawamba, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-falls" target="_blank">Biden gets knocked down</a>. Then he gets up again. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-bike-memes" target="_blank">Then he falls down again</a>. It's what he's known for. That, and having a "bathroom incident" in front of the Pope. Allegedly.</p><p>Stephen A. can't take it no more.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">I’ll say it…and I know this will make some people mad…but I just think someone 80+ years old is too old to be President. <br /><br />There has to be better options <a href="https://t.co/keewnqFYU0">pic.twitter.com/keewnqFYU0</a><br />— Stephen A Smith (@stephenasmith) <a href="https://twitter.com/stephenasmith/status/1664739852280102912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 2, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>"I don’t believe in ageism," declared Smith. "But there are responsibilities that are far, far, far more extensive than a typical 9-to-5 <em>[editor's note: what a way to make a living]</em> that somebody in their 80s may not need to be doing. I think the presidency is one of them."</p><p>Long story short, if you are someone who thinks Joe Biden is healthy, can handle the rigors of being president, or has full control of his faculties and/or bowels?</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>If not Biden, who? Republicans at least have choices. We have 76-year-old Donald Trump, who is only four years younger than Biden. Or 44-year-old Ron DeSantis, who is thirty-six years younger than the current president. Not only is Stephen A Smith a Democrat (he claims he's an independent, but whatever) he has already ruled out DeSantis and the elderly Trump.<br /></p><p>Smith wants Michelle Obama to get into the race, <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2023/06/05/stephen-a-smith-biden-2024-michelle-obama-second-term/" target="_blank">who he claims would win in a landslide</a>. Lefties have been wishcasting about a Michelle political run for years now. To anyone who still is holding out hope?</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>That leaves him Robert Kennedy Jr and Marianne Williamson. Maaaaaaybe Joe Manchin if he ever decides to sh*t or get off the pot. Manchin would, if nothing else, be interesting because the media and the DNC (but I repeat myself) would not be able to ignore him as easily as the other two.</p><p>I know Biden is too old. You know Biden is too old. Stephen A. knows Biden is too old. Hell, <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/jake-tapper-cnn-joe-biden-horrible-election-poll-numbers/" target="_blank">the American people know Biden is too old</a>. Unfortunately for Stephen A. and other Dems like him, the people using Biden for either a job or a patsy know they'll never be arrested for senior abuse.</p><p><p><em>Facebook doesn't want you reading this post or any others lately.

<img src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/paula-scanlan-unmasks-herself-as-the-anonymous-lia-thomas-teammate-from-matt-walsh-s-what-is-a-woman.png?id=33806613&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0" /><br /><br /><p>Lia Thomas's teammate, speaking anonymously out of fear of having her life destroyed (because people told her she'd have her life destroyed) was one the more alarming segments of the Matt Walsh documentary "What Is A Woman?" Or, as NBC News calls it, "<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/musk-elon-twitter-ella-irwin-trans-video-what-is-a-woman-stream-rcna87429?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_ma&amp;taid=647a8295f016640001f1c4e2&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter" target="_blank">a 95-minute anti-transgender video.</a>" Remember kids, corporate journalismers do NOT play sides.</p><p>The teammate, Paula Scanlan, is publically speaking out and shared more details with Walsh. They include a meeting with WILL Thomas (I said what I said) and the chilling effects the University of Pennsylvania's threats left on the team. The girls on the team. Both Will and Lia were solid.</p><h3>So, where were we...</h3><br /><p>
	In the 95-minute video (seriously, NBC News put some work into that one), an "anonymous teammate" talked about how <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lia-thomas-teammate-speaks-out" target="_blank">the girls were all told to keep their opinions</a> on competing against Lia and <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10445679/Lia-Thomas-UPenn-teammate-says-trans-swimmer-doesnt-cover-genitals-locker-room.html" target="_blank">having Lia walk around the girls' locker room</a> with her cock hanging out to themselves. As we have since learned in Riley Gaines's congressional testimony, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/riley-gaines-congressional-hearing" target="_blank">the resolution there was to say it was no longer a girl's locker room</a>.
</p><p>
	Here is what Teammate X said then:
</p><blockquote>
	If you speak up about it, your life will be over in some way, you’ll be blasted all over the internet as a ‘transphobe,’ […] you’ll never be able to get a job.<br />
<br />
	If you even bring up the fact that Lia’s swimming might not be fair, you’re immediately shut down and called a hateful person, or transphobic.<br />
<br />
	Penn actually brought in people high up in the athletic department to talk to us, like brought in someone from the LGBTQ center, they brought in someone from psychological services.</blockquote><p>
	Yes, Penn brought in someone from psychological services to help the female swimmers get more comfortable with Thomas as if the other swimmers were the problem.
</p><div class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" style="display: flex; width: 100%; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"></div> <h3>"If you complain to the media, you'll regret it..."</h3><br /><p>Before we get to the meeting where Penn threatened Lia's teammates to stay silent, Paula shared another meeting that took place the year before with Will Thomas. Yes, WILL Thomas the mid male swimmer <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lia-thomas-ncaa-victory" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">who only ranked #462 as a boy</a>. Will addressed the team and said, "Great news, you guys! I'm transitioning to Lia and will be competing as a girl next year. Yay team!"</p><p>At which point, Will left the meeting he was allowed to run, and the girls were told they were dismissed by their coach.</p><p>Paula gave further detail about the meeting discussed in "What Is A Woman?" where the other FEMALE teammates' concerns were "addressed" by the university. Prior to the meeting, the girls would talk about how horrible the situation they were forced into was. And that they thought someone would step in and stop this. Common sense would prevail. After?</p><blockquote>After that meeting, they really scared us. It was scary. And I was petrified. I went home that night and I called my brother on the phone and I said, "Can I even talk about this with you? Is there something wrong with me for thinking this is wrong?' [The school's threatening meeting] worked. The university wanted us to be quiet and they did it in a very effective way. They continued to just tell us our opinions were wrong. And that if we had a problem with it we were wrong. And it was frightening. And your future job is on the line. So of course, it worked. After that point, no one would talk about it.</blockquote><p><br /></p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cA teammate of Lia Thomas appeared in What Is A Woman anonymously. A few days ago she came to us and said she is ready to come out publicly and tell her story. I had a longer conversation with Paula where she revealed a number of details that weren't covered in the film. Watch:\u201d</div> — Matt Walsh (@Matt Walsh)
        <a href="https://twitter.com/MattWalshBlog/status/1665860950409244673">1686007175</a>
</blockquote>
<p>God bless Paula for having the courage to speak out. Lia has since moved on to become a spokestrans for Joe Biden's changes to Title IX. The rules were put into place so that girls could have the same opportunities to learn, grow, and develop through school athletics that WIll Thomas had. Now both Lia and Joe want other males to take advantage.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
