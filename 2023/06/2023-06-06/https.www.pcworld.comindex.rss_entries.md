<p>Time to update your browser again&mdash;Google just released a new security patch for Chrome to address another zero-day flaw. It&rsquo;s the third discovered this year, barely a month and a half after the first two revealed.</p>



<p>Announced in a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2023/06/stable-channel-update-for-desktop.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1944324-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">June 5th security bulletin</a> and highlighted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-fixes-new-chrome-zero-day-flaw-with-exploit-in-the-wild/&amp;xcust=2-1-1944324-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Bleeping Computer</a>, details are scarce about CVE-2023-3079. As with other high-severity flaws that have a known exploit, Google is only sharing that it is a type confusion error in Chrome&rsquo;s V8 JavaScript engine, which can allow hackers to execute their own malicious code through the browser. Google researcher Cl&eacute;ment Lecigne uncovered it on June 1st.</p>



<p>Lecigne also brought to light the two zero-day flaws announced in April. The first was a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1788808/update-chrome-now-to-protect-yourself-from-this-zero-day-exploit.html">type confusion error</a> while the second was a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1791506/chrome-gets-its-second-emergency-patch-this-week.html">vulnerability in Skia</a>, Chrome&rsquo;s 2D graphics library.</p>

<p>Users should update their browsers now to apply the fix, which is part of Chrome version 114.0.5735.110 for Windows. (Linux and Mac users should look for version 114.0.5735.106). If an automatic update isn&rsquo;t ready, head to Chrome&rsquo;s settings by clicking on the three dot icon in the upper right, then choosing <em>Help &gt; About Google Chrome</em>. (Alternatively, you can type <em>chrome://settings/help</em> into the address bar). This should manually trigger the update. When complete, you will be asked to restart your browser. Bleeping Computer says that the update is still rolling out, so you may need to check for it more than once if it isn&rsquo;t available to you yet.</p>

## MacBook Air: Fact-checking Apple’s WWDC performance claims

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t have to fact check a multi-billion, strike that, multi-<em>trillion</em> dollar company, but we&rsquo;d be remiss if we took the marketing claims that a company uses to sell a product at face value. For Apple&rsquo;s WWDC 2023 announcement of the MacBook Air 15, the company didn&rsquo;t get overly creative in its hype, but there are two claims we felt worth examining closely.</p>



<p><strong>Claim: </strong>&ldquo;In fact, the new Air is 12 times faster than the fastest Intel-based MacBook Air,&rdquo; Apple said in its hype video.</p>



<p><strong>Fact check:</strong> For the record, the last Intel-based MacBook Air made by Apple is more than three years old and was built in the smaller and half-a-pound lighter 13-inch MacBook Air body. Weight doesn&rsquo;t always mean more performance, but it often does, and half a pound is a lot.</p>



<p>In this comparison, though, the CPU gets most of the credit. The new MacBook Air 15 uses an Apple Arm-based M2 chip with eight CPU cores and 10 GPU cores. Since Apple doesn&rsquo;t ever mention the exact CPU used in its Intel Macs, we looked it up on EveryMac, and the fastest of that series used a four-core 10th-gen Intel Core i7-1060NG7 with a base clock of 1.2GHz and boost clock of 3.8GHz.</p>



<p>Intel&rsquo;s 10th-gen Ice Lake chips were its first 10nm-based generation and were an improvement over the older 8th-gen, 14nm-based chips, but still it was dinged by some for the relatively low boost clocks. The 11th-gen CPU that replaced it, for example, pushed the turbo boost to 4.8GHz.</p>



<p>So how does Apple claim its &ldquo;12x faster?&rdquo; We have no idea, which is odd since Apple is comparing a MacBook with a MacBook and presumably any comparison tests it runs, can be easily validated.</p>



<p>Do we doubt Apple&rsquo;s claims? Not entirely, but it would really make us feel better to know what it used. We&rsquo;ve kicked the tires on the M1 and M2 laptops and they are plenty impressive, so we don&rsquo;t think the 12x claim is too out of bounds, especially against such old hardware. But what is tested matters. After all, there are indeed some things on the 2020 Intel-based MacBook Air 13 that would likely still be faster than the MacBook Air 15 if you looked hard enough. Overall, we think the claim is mostly based in reality&mdash;we just don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll get 12x performance in all tasks.</p>



<p>The real marketing sleight of hand though is comparing a 3-year-old laptop with its newest model. That&rsquo;s probably fair if Apple wants to get those with older MacBook Air laptops to upgrade&mdash;but obviously it&rsquo;s also to Apple&rsquo;s advantage to ignore the fact that the new MacBook Air 15 will only be marginally faster than last year&rsquo;s MacBook Air 13 and probably not a huge improvement over the original M1-based MacBook Air 13 either.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Apple WWDC 23 presentation claim" class="wp-image-1942858" height="646" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2x.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Apple</p></div>



<p><strong>Claim: </strong>&ldquo;When compared to the best-selling 15-inch PC laptop with a Core i7 processor, the new MacBook Air is up to twice as fast.&rdquo;</p>



<p><strong>Fact check:</strong> Rather than comparing to a 3-year-old laptop, Apple apparently takes a swing at the newest PC laptops with this claim. So which laptop does Apple base this claim on? We don&rsquo;t know. The company does say the model &ldquo;is based on publicly available sales data over the prior 12 months&rdquo; but where the company sourced the sales data isn&rsquo;t disclosed.</p>



<p>Fortunately, Apple did publish more details of how it makes the &ldquo;twice as fast&rdquo; claim. That appears to be based on a comparison of a pre-production MacBook Air 15 with an 8-core M2, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD and a 15-inch laptop with a Core i7-based PC with Intel Iris Xe Graphics, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD, running Windows 11.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, not knowing the model that Apple is comparing the MacBook Air 15 to leaves a pretty big gulf for comparison. Was it a laptop with a Core i7 H-, P- or U-class CPU? Was it a 12th-gen or 13th-gen Intel CPU? Was it an even older laptop using even older hardware since it&rsquo;s based on sales history? While the MacBook Air 15 has its impressive graphics, why wasn&rsquo;t there discrete graphics in the 15-inch Windows laptop that Apple is comparing it to? On the majority of 15-inch PC laptops, discrete graphics from Nvidia are fairly common.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Apple does at least detail the tests it used for the claim: &ldquo;Adobe Photoshop 24.3.0 tested using the following filters and functions: select sky, oil paint, adaptive wide angle, picture frame, and tree. Open source project built on macOS with Xcode 14.3 with Apple Clang 14.0.3; open source project built on Windows with Clang 14.0.6. Premiere Pro 23.3.0 tested using a 55-second clip with 4K Apple ProRes RAW media, at 4096&times;2160 resolution and 59.94 frames per second, transcoded to Apple ProRes 422 at 29.97 frames per second. Performance tests are conducted using specific computer systems and reflect the approximate performance of MacBook Air.&rdquo;</p>



<p>All three tasks are real tasks but there are some things you can quibble with. The tests in Photoshop are five certain tasks out of dozens and dozens of features in the application. Were the tasks &ldquo;cherry picked&rdquo; to be faster or representative of overall performance? We do know the Adaptive Wide Angle filter is generally optimized for Intel processors, which makes the selection feel somewhat fair. However, Apple has historically &ldquo;cherry picked&rdquo; Photoshop filters to make performance claims and was criticized for doing so when it used PowerPC processors.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ll also note that for the Adobe Premiere Pro test, Apple picks media using ProRes RAW and converts it to ProRes. That&rsquo;s fine if you use ProRes, but we&rsquo;ll also point out that ProRes is a codec owned and operated by Apple and is about as close to home-court advantage as you can get. So is the new MacBook Air 15 &ldquo;twice as fast&rdquo; as the best-selling Core i7 Windows laptop? In some things yes, in others no. The reality is that the &ldquo;twice as fast&rdquo; claim is likely to be true only some of the time.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing more annoying than wrist pain from using a taller keyboard, making it difficult to get through those long gaming sessions. If you deal with wrist pain, you may want to invest in a low profile keyboard, which is more comfortable to use because you don&rsquo;t have to raise your hands up as much. Luckily for you, Amazon&rsquo;s selling the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Wireless-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B07NY9ZT92&amp;xcust=2-1-1941175-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Logitech G915 Lightspeed Low Profile Mechanical Gaming Keyboard for just $161.99</a>, which is 33 percent off of the original $249.99 price. This peripheral is shorter than most keyboards and more ergonomic as a result.</p>



<p>The Logitech G915 features up to 30 hours of battery life on a single charge, GL Clicky switches, RGB lighting, five dedicated G-keys (for macros and such), and more. The keyboard itself is made of aircraft-grade aluminum alloy and the GL Clicky switches provide tactile feedback and distinctive sounds. According to one buyer on Amazon, the linear keystrokes are buttery smooth and the keyboard is &ldquo;stable as a rock&rdquo; despite the super thin design. It&rsquo;s also wireless, so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about cable management. </p>



<p>This is a great deal. Get it now.</p>

<p>The OBSBOT Tiny 4K certainly ranks among the best webcams you can buy, 4K or not, period. It offers so much: 4K video, a 60fps option (albeit at 1080p), and the real magic: an automated gimbal that physically rotates and dips the webcam to center your face. </p>



<p>It gets better. The OBSBOT Tiny 4K (sometimes sold as the OBSBOT Tiny PTZ 4K) will soon be <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.obsbot.com/obsbot-tiny-2-4k-webcam/specs&amp;xcust=2-1-1935922-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">supplemented by</a> the Tiny 2, with a larger sensor for improved video. That should help solve one of the Tiny 4K&rsquo;s only shortcomings: video quality is good, just not outstanding. On the other hand, OBSBOT is discounting the Tiny PTZ 4K in anticipation of the Tiny 2&rsquo;s launch, so you can save a large chunk off of its regular $269.99 MSRP.</p>



<p>The Tiny 4K ships in two pieces: a magnetic mount, and the camera assembly itself, packaged together inside a zipped carrying case that OBSBOT provides. OBSBOT also provides the choice between a 4.92ft/1.5m USB-C to USB-C cable, or a USB-C to USB-A cable inside the same box. Just be sure to connect the latter to a USB 3.1 port (as opposed to USB 2.0) to ensure that the webcam has enough power.</p>



<p>The OSBBOT Tiny 4K feels exceptionally well-designed, with touches that you might not need yet are provided anyway. The magnetic mount holds the camera assembly fast, with the folding &ldquo;jaws&rdquo; being long and pronounced enough to handle even thicker displays. The mount assembly even comes with a small, sticky surface that can be peeled off to affix the mount, though you probably won&rsquo;t need it.</p>

<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="OBSBOT Tiny PTZ 4K" class="wp-image-1937701" height="872" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/OBSBOT-Tiny-4K-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The OBSBOT Tiny 4K looks a little precarious when perched on a laptop, but it sits easily, and you can even stick it to a surface to help secure it.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>All told, the webcam and its mount measures 5.59 inches tall, and 2.28 inches wide and deep. The gimbal and separate mount weigh 0.37lbs together.</p>



<h2 id="the-tiny-4k-has-incredible-simple-configurability">The Tiny 4K has incredible, simple configurability</h2>



<p>This is one of the few cameras whose utility software, downloadable from the OBSBOT website, feels truly necessary. OBSBOT supplies the traditional image controls: brightness, exposure, white balance, and anti-flicker controls, but also auto-focus and exposure controls (metered globally, or else specifically on your face). </p>



<p>The premium features the OBSBOT Tiny 4K includes are also controllable. The real magic of the Tiny 4K is how it locks on and tracks your face, and this can be triggered via the OBSBOT Webcam utility. OBSBOT, however, goes further: Not only can you set the auto-focusing camera to automatically orient itself on your face, you can manually configure how you appear on camera, too. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>The OBSBOT Tiny 4K is extremely well designed, combining both 4K and 60Hz options with an automated gimbal that can physically track your face.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>A &ldquo;headroom&rdquo; setting tilts the camera up a bit to create &ldquo;space&rdquo; above your head, if you so prefer. You can even manually adjust the automatic gimbal so that the camera positions your face to one side or the other, for captioning or graphics. (While the camera will track you around a room, for a full 360 degrees, you can manually configure the gimbal 150 degrees with 45 degrees of tilt.) You can also set the field of view (86, 78, or 65 degrees) and optically zoom between 1X and 4X. The Tiny 4K&rsquo;s level of configurability is simply above and beyond most competing webcams on the market today.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="OBSBOT Tiny PTZ 4K" class="wp-image-1937702" height="803" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/OBSBOT-Tiny-4K-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The magnetic mount helps keep the  Tiny 4K webcam steady, and allows it to rotate around.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>OBSBOT even allows you to lock the camera on your face through gestures: holding your hand out, palm up, identifies you as the &ldquo;target&rdquo;. Holding your fingers in the shape of an &ldquo;L&rdquo; zooms in and out. All of these gestures worked perfectly out of the box, though I found that I needed to re-identify myself on one occasion. </p>



<p>There is no privacy shutter, though the device will enter sleep mode if not actively being used. You can also manually push the camera down; when it&rsquo;s pointed down it enters sleep mode, turning off the mic and camera. (Windows&rsquo; Sound Recorder and Camera apps confirmed this.) The camera tends to forget your preferences if you unplug it or shut your PC down, though you can save them as a preset, too.</p>



<h2 id="how-does-the-obsbot-tiny-4k-perform">How does the OBSBOT Tiny 4K perform?</h2>



<p>The Tiny PTZ 4K&rsquo;s face tracking is pretty amazing. The Tiny 4K is slow, but dogged; you can literally walk around your display and the camera will follow you, albeit slowly. That&rsquo;s one of the only knocks against this webcam, as you&rsquo;ll grow used to it tracking you as you shift about in your seat and even pace the room. (Just beware if you lean away to blow your nose!) It&rsquo;s a little gimmicky in the fact that most of us don&rsquo;t pace the room while on a video call&mdash;and if you do, your viewers may see some odd angles as the camera tracks you.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="OBSBOT Tiny PTZ 4K webcam office" class="wp-image-1937697" height="653" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/OBSBOT-Tiny-4K-office.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The OBSBOT Tiny 4K, with a representative webcam shot at 4K, using the settings shown in the OSBCOM utility to the right. Not bad, though my face could benefit from a ring light.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>If it loses sight of you, the Tiny 4K will seek out the last known location of your face, then swivel left and right and up and down until it re-acquires you. A small array of LEDs on the front signal if everything&rsquo;s okay (green) and whether it&rsquo;s recognized any gesture commands you&rsquo;ve made. </p>



<p>The OBSBOT Tiny 4K&rsquo;s video quality is pretty good, on par if slightly inferior to the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1654613/razer-kiyo-pro-ultra-webcam-review.html">Razer Kiyo Pro Ultra</a>, which looks about as good as any webcam delivers. About the only complaints I have is that the video resolution is only adjustable in the preview mode, and the HDR adjustment can&rsquo;t work wonders in a backlit room. Keep in mind, too, that 4K resolution is only achievable in 30Hz. If you want to capture or broadcast in 60Hz, you&rsquo;ll need to step down to 1080p.</p>

<p>As you can see in the screenshot below, the autofocusing could stand to improve, too. The dual noise-cancelling mics, however, filtered out background sounds pretty effectively, though they did a better job paired with the noise-cancelling algorithms in Zoom, for exampe.</p>

## This tiny MacBook Air feature could lead to a laptop PC makeover

<p>It&rsquo;s fair to say that most laptops don&rsquo;t ship with great speakers. But Apple&rsquo;s MacBook Pro has made great audio a real emphasis, and now Apple&rsquo;s bringing a key component of this to its latest 15-inch MacBook Air: six speakers.</p>



<p>Even laptops that are known for good sound (Microsoft&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/538948/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-review.html">Surface Laptop Studio</a> comes to mind) usually have four speakers: two tweeters and two woofers. Adding a third speaker to either side means a dedicated speaker for the low, midrange, and highest frequency ranges, improving the overall audio quality immensely.</p>



<p>Until now, Apple has reserved this feature for the MacBook Pro, which commands an Apple-like price of above $2,000. But Apple announced a 15-inch version of the Air on Monday, and lo and behold &mdash; it has six speakers, too, alongside three noise-cancelling mics. Even better, the 15-inch Air is priced at just $1,299 for the base model, though additional options will push it higher than that.</p>



<p>The key takeaway, however, is that Apple is moving a six-speaker configuration into a mainstream, (relatively) affordable laptop model, and that&rsquo;s good news for the laptop market in general. While the 13-inch MacBook Air only includes two speakers (owing to its smaller size, presumably), Apple took pains to note that the 13-inch Air is the world&rsquo;s highest-selling laptop model. That&rsquo;s something that rivals certainly take note of, and will carefully watch to see how the 15-inch Air sells, too.</p>



<p>Apple&rsquo;s new 15-inch Air is just 11.5mm thin, Apple says. That&rsquo;s impressive, given that thin laptops like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1499055/samsung-galaxy-book3-pro-360-review.html">Samsung Galaxy Book Book3 Pro 360</a> are a sliver thicker, at 12.7mm thick, and only have four speakers. Inside the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-air/15-inch-m2&amp;xcust=2-3-1942496-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Apple 15-inch MacBook Air</a> you&rsquo;ll have a choice of either 256GB ($1,299) or 512GB ($1,499) of storage, running alongside Apple&rsquo;s M2 chip. The display measures 15.3 inches, outputs 500 nits of luminance, and the laptop ships with MagSafe charging and two Thunderbolt ports.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s possible that Apple is continuing to play the same sort of semantic games that it has in the past. In 2021, Apple&rsquo;s iMac introduced &ldquo;force-cancelling woofers,&rdquo; the same technology that Apple claims is in the new MacBook Air. What a &ldquo;force-cancelling woofer&rdquo; does is use a pair of woofers, firing in opposite directions, and mounted directly over one another. These woofers &ldquo;cancel&rdquo; any vibrations and help the audio sound clearer. It&rsquo;s not clear whether Apple is characterizing these as a pair of woofers, or just one.</p>



<p>Again, laptop speakers haven&rsquo;t been as much of an issue in recent years, given that the last thing anyone wants to hear in a crowded office is any additional background noise, whether it be music, video, or a video call. At home, however, the enforced isolation of the pandemic helped thrust the audio quality of laptop speakers into the limelight &mdash; suddenly it became just fine to blast Taylor Swift in the privacy of your home office.</p>



<p>Combine the popularity of the MacBook Air and its upgraded speaker system, and it seems reasonable to expect more premium speaker systems to creep into Windows PCs. Laptop makers are always looking to differentiate themselves, and three speakers are always better than two, right? Give credit where credit is due, though: This trend should benefit more than just Apple.</p>

## Apple’s Vision Pro rips off the HoloLens, seven years later

<p>Pinnable windows floating in midair. Three-dimensional dinosaurs. Video calls. 3D castles emerging from the ground. No, i&rsquo;m not talking about the capabilities of Apple&rsquo;s new Vision Pro VR/AR headset. These are all things that Microsoft&rsquo;s HoloLens could do when it launched roughly <em>seven years ago</em>.</p>



<p>Apple has a reputation for re-inventing technology, and boy, was that underscored in Monday&rsquo;s launch of the Vision Pro at Apple&rsquo;s WWDC.</p>



<p>For months behind-the-scenes reporting has indicated that even Apple employees have questioned the launch of the Vision Pro, an AR/VR headset that executives said was in the works for years. But what it actually is still isn&rsquo;t as clear as we&rsquo;d like. Detailed spec pages accompanied Apple&rsquo;s launch of the Mac Studio and the new 15-inch MacBook Air. Not the Vision Pro: We know it supplies more than 12 million pixels per eye, but at an unknown refresh rate. And Apple carefully hid the cable running from the headset to the battery pack &mdash; which allows for only two hours of battery life, anyway. </p>



<p>To be fair, the most egregious Apple-esque extravagance, the Vision Pro&rsquo;s price, <em>wasn&rsquo;t</em> that far off the mark. Microsoft originally launched the HoloLens for a whopping $3,000, as a developer device. Apple didn&rsquo;t say so, but the Vision Pro&rsquo;s $3,500 price tag isn&rsquo;t aimed at even a typical Mac consumer.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Apple Vision Pro" class="wp-image-1942769" height="570" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The Apple Vision Pro.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Apple</p></div>



<p>You&rsquo;ll hopefully hear from our colleagues at Macworld on what the Vision Pro delivers. <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/557878/apple-reality-headset-ar-vr-design-features-specs-price.html">Macworld&rsquo;s Vision Pro summary page</a> reveals more about what it is: an augmented-reality headset that can dial into virtual reality by twisting a dial, with sensors that map the room using a depth camera. The real improvements arrive with how you will interact with content: the Vision Pro tracks your eyes, and external, downwards-facing cameras can watch to see if you &ldquo;click&rdquo; with your fingers.</p>



<p>Apple has apparently taken a very general approach to what the Vision Pro can do. Can it watch movies? Sure. Can users use it to work in Office, like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1919392/spacetop-is-the-first-laptop-without-a-screen.html">Spacetop AR laptop</a>? Yep. Editing a photo using Lightroom? Why not. Facetime? Sure, including transforming you into an avatar. Bob Iger, Disney&rsquo;s chief executive, even appeared to show a concept reel about watching Disney+ inside AR, and an AR version of Disneyland&rsquo;s Main Street USA. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Apple Vision Pro" class="wp-image-1942768" height="587" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-2-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Is the Apple Vision Pro an entertainment device? A productivity device? Yes.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Apple</p></div>



<p>Okay, it&rsquo;s all cool, I guess. It&rsquo;s just that, compared to the original HoloLens vision, the future that the Apple Vision Pro promises looks so, well, blas&eacute;.</p>



<h2 id="hololens-one-of-the-best-demos-ever">HoloLens: One of the best demos, ever</h2>



<p>The launch of the original HoloLens was something that Microsoft never livestreamed. We could only <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/431414/hands-on-with-microsofts-hololens-the-3d-augmented-reality-future-is-now.html">describe it in our hands-on</a>, and to my knowledge Microsoft never actually published a walkthrough of its experiences. It was certainly among the best demonstrations I&rsquo;ve ever seen, which included the ability to place &ldquo;holograms&rdquo; around a room, pin a video window to a wall, and more. The <em>Minecraft</em> demo was literally jaw-dropping: The HoloLens turned an ordinary living room into a <em>Minecraft</em> set, with the ability to &ldquo;detonate&rdquo; TNT and &ldquo;mine&rdquo; into a coffee table that transformed into a 3D landscape. A demo Microsoft showed off at E3 hints at what we saw, especially the opening snapshot:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Other demonstrations included participants rewiring a live (as in, real-world) light socket, assisted by a pinned Skype window; walking across an AR version of Mars; and more. </p>



<p>Microsoft didn&rsquo;t bring all of these visions to life, including, sadly, the HoloLens version of <em>Minecraft.</em> But the original HoloLens sits in my office, and in 2019 I spent a few hours in our office late at night with Microsoft&rsquo;s AR headset, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/403327/microsoft-hololens-what-made-it-great-and-what-a-new-hololens-needs.html">re-reviewing the HoloLens</a>, as it were.  Some of the applications were amazing for the time. Even if Microsoft canned <em>Minecraft</em>, a similar app, <em>Conker&rsquo;s Bad Fur Day</em>, used the depth camera to create platforming AR &ldquo;levels&rdquo; out of real-world floors, desks, and chairs.</p>



<p>This video I captured, from the HoloLens itself, shows some of the experiences that were available even then. The biggest obstacle? The limited field of view, which made the AR vision more like a porthole than a fully immersive experience.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div><figcaption>What&rsquo;s this? Oh, a 3D tyrannosaur, which Apple also showed of briefly as part of its Vision Pro launch.</figcaption></figure>



<p>At $1,500, the competing <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1346787/hands-on-with-the-meta-quest-pro-vr-headset-pricy-power.html">Meta Quest Pro </a>didn&rsquo;t very practical, either. But chief executive Mark Zuckerberg at least reoriented his company around what he called the metaverse, even if Meta now appears to be refocusing on AI. The Vision Pro doesn&rsquo;t look like Apple quite understands what consumers will use it for, and hopes that developers will come up with an answer.</p>



<p>To be fair, that strategy has paid off before, with consumers and developers telling Apple what products like, say, the Apple Watch are actually good for. </p>



<p>Microsoft, though, didn&rsquo;t care about being dorky. Apple does, and the corded battery pack and the weirdly creepy EyeSight &mdash; where a front-mounted OLED screen reproduces your face when someone else approaches &mdash; don&rsquo;t do Apple&rsquo;s culture of cool any favors. Neither does the battery life. Two hours? That&rsquo;s barely enough time for a movie. Apple also notes that you&rsquo;ll get &ldquo;all day battery life&rdquo; when plugged in. How&rsquo;s that going to work?</p>



<p>The HoloLens could have been the Vision Pro. Again, it had a <em>seven-year head start</em>. Microsoft could have trimmed down the weight, added a better processor, and so on. Today, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/611416/report-microsoft-hololens-is-dead-as-its-mixed-reality-vision-implodes.html">HoloLens is all but dead</a>. Meta&rsquo;s metaverse isn&rsquo;t that far off, it seems. Apple? Well, it doesn&rsquo;t quite seem to know what it has on its hands. It just feels like some of us, at least, have seen it all before.</p>

<p>Asus&rsquo;s original ROG Zephyrus M16 made powerful performance a real possibility in a slim and light 16-inch gaming laptop, and while the 2023 M16 doesn&rsquo;t quite reinvent the wheel here, remarkably, and despite some very decent upgrades, the new model holds firm to that principle, just about equaling the size and weight of its more recent forebear.</p>



<p>Indeed, Asus have taken a more conciliatory approach to this year&rsquo;s M16, keeping the bones of the laptop intact while building upon key performance hardware &ndash; improving the power output with 13th-gen Intel and Nvidia RTX 40 Series chips, ramping up the TGP to 140 watts and my favorite new addition, changing out the IPS QHD+ display to be a QHD+ Mini LED panel clocked at 240Hz. If that&rsquo;s not enough for you to hit the trigger on it, you may take solace knowing the M16 is one of the more affordable mid-range laptops in its class.</p>

<h2 id="asus-rog-zephyrus-m16-specs-and-features">Asus ROG Zephyrus M16: Specs and features</h2>



<p>You can find three variants of the Asus ROG Zephryrus M16 at Asus&rsquo;s online store, each sporting an i9-13900H processor but with different RTX 40 Series GPUs or other varying components. My review unit with its RTX 4070 is currently the most affordable of the bunch, retailing for $1,949.99 at <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fasus-rog-zephyrus-16-240hz-gaming-laptop-qhd-intel-13th-gen-core-i9-with-16gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-1tb-ssd-off-black%2F6535501.p%3FacampID%3D0%26%23038%3Bcmp%3DRMX%26%23038%3Bloc%3DHatch%26%23038%3Bref%3D198%26%23038%3Brefdomain%3Dasus.com%26%23038%3BskuId%3D6535501&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed" rel="nofollow">Best Buy</a>, while a top-line variant with a souped-up RTX 4090 GPU will cost you $3,499.99 USD at Asus Online.</p>



<p>Scouring the field of other 16-inch laptops for price comparisons, our model&rsquo;s $1,949.99 sticker price skims more than a $1,000 USD off the price of a 2023 Razer Blade 16, which ships with the same RTX 4070 GPU (for $2,999.99) but with a more premium Intel i9-13950HX CPU.</p>



<p>The 2023 Lenovo Legion Pro 7i makes a closer comparison, with one model featuring an Intel i9-13900HX CPU and identical GPU as my review unit&rsquo;s and yet the M16 is still slightly cheaper. The Lenovo currently costs $2,175, which is $200 more. The exact specifications of this particular M16 review unit are as follows:</p>



<ul><li><strong>CPU:</strong> Intel Core i9-13900H</li><li><strong>RAM: </strong>32GB DDR5 / 4800Hz</li><li><strong>GPU:</strong> Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070</li><li><strong>Display:</strong> 16-inch QHD+ (2560&times;1600), Mini-LED, 100% DCI-P3 color gamut, 16:10 ratio, 240 Hz refresh rate, 3ms response rate, Pantone Validated, MUX Switch and Advanced Optimus, G-sync</li><li><strong>Storage: </strong>1TB NMVe PCle Gen 4 SSD</li><li><strong>Ports:</strong> 2 x USB-A 3.2 Gen 2, USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 (DisplayPort and Power Delivery), Thunderbolt 4, HDMI 2.1, 3.5 mm combo audio jack</li><li><strong>Networking:</strong> Wi-Fi 6E(802.11ax), Bluetooth 5.3</li><li><strong>Weight:</strong> 4.63 lbs (2.10kg)</li><li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 13.98 x 9.69 x 0.78 inches</li><li><strong>Webcam:</strong> 1080p FHD IF camera, Windows Hello</li><li><strong>Battery Capacity:</strong> 90WHrs</li><li><strong>Price:</strong> $1,949.99 (with 16GB) from Best Buy</li></ul>



<h2 id="asus-rog-zephyrus-m16-design-and-build">Asus ROG Zephyrus M16: Design and build</h2>



<p>This year&rsquo;s Zephyrus M16 boasts next generation CPU and GPU upgrades that push the power envelope further, yet impressively its proportions remain the same as in 2022. It measures a precise 3.98 x 9.57 x 0.78 inches which fits last year&rsquo;s Zephyrus M16 chassis like a glove. A tiny weight gain of 3.52 ounces means it&rsquo;s only slightly heavier year-on-year, so you won&rsquo;t need to double what you bench-press at the gym.</p>



<p>The size of the display too is mostly unchanged from last year, meaning it&rsquo;s big and gorgeous and a stunning sight to behold. It&rsquo;s still exceptionally tall thanks to its 16:10 aspect ratio, which means there&rsquo;s extra eye candy for movies or just catching up on a little work or gaming. Personally, I was super stoked that I could finally actually see those tiny war elephants in <em>Age of Mythology: Extended Edition</em> that I usually have to squint to see.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>&rdquo;the M16&rsquo;s QHD+ (2560 x 1600) Mini LED, is in every way the epitome of a bright, immensely colorful but also remarkably smooth gaming panel</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>The ultra slim bezels and the extra low-set hinges really carry the laptop here, doing wonders to frame the display up as splendidly as can be, such that the M16 can boast a whopping 92 percent screen-to-body ratio, which is no mean feat of engineering.</p>



<p>But alas there are other meaty changes to be found in this year&rsquo;s M16. For one, the HDMI port has been upgraded from a HDMI 2.0 to HDMI 2.1, so it benefits from the much higher 48Gbps bandwidth. The new model also ships without a LAN port, relying instead on wireless connectivity upgrades in the form of Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 &ndash; the fastest currently available. Suffice to say, excellent wireless even of this caliber isn&rsquo;t quite a replacement for a quick reliable LAN connection, so this is kind of a sore point with me.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Zephyrus M16" class="wp-image-1935012" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Back-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The Asus ROG Zephyrus M16&rsquo;s top cover has over 18,000 tiny perforations that you can light up in models that have the AniMe Matrix feature. Shown here: our review model without this feature.&nbsp;</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>Still, the port selection is very good. You get multiple USB-C and USB-A ports to play with, so I never had an issue finding an outlet for a favorite mouse, external keyboard, or USB dock. One of the USB-C ports is a Thunderbolt 4 port, which I quickly made use of to transfer excessively large games, like the 100GB plus <em>Elden Ring</em>, which I&rsquo;d rather watch paint dry than sit and wait to download.</p>



<p>For styling, my M16 looked a little understated up against its flashier 2023 stablemate the 16-inch Asus ROG Strix G16, which I happened to be testing at the same time. It eschews features like the G16&rsquo;s blinged out RGB light bar at the front and transparent cyber punk keys, in favor of a plain front and single-color Backlit Chiclet keyboard. The M16 comes in just one color, too &ndash; black &ndash; so the whole thing looks remarkably modest.</p>



<p>That is, my model looked modest &ndash; being the variant that shipped without a feature called AniMe Matrix. This feature lights up the 18,710 machined perforated holes in the M16&rsquo;s lid to create a dazzling LED light display, although it only comes in some variants, so it&rsquo;s worth checking before you buy if you do want to add some razzle dazzle to the styling.</p>



<h2 id="asus-rog-zephyrus-m16-keyboard-and-trackpad">Asus ROG Zephyrus M16: Keyboard and trackpad</h2>



<p>The M16&rsquo;s trackpad fit snugly in the chassis, providing ample space for my arms to assume a relaxed typing position. That kept me comfortable through one of the longest quest chains in <em>WoW Classic: Wrath of the Lich King </em>I&rsquo;ve ever done &ndash; <em>Escape the Lich King&rsquo;s grasp</em>. Additionally, the trackpad felt soft enough for all day use and made hardly any sound, which was ideal for a sly gaming sessions in the library.</p>

<p>The keyboard has both merits and pitfalls, in that it&rsquo;s reasonably well sized, but the keys feel a little too mushy to be truly comfortable. For one, they&rsquo;re quite low set into the keyboard already, but drop down a quarter inch more when you press them and don&rsquo;t rebound well.</p>



<p>The layout is perfectly fine for all your gaming needs, however, being the standard type you&rsquo;d expect on a 16-inch laptop. It lacks a dedicated numpad, but provides all the Fn keys as well as go-to gaming favorites like Left and Right Shift keys. You do get useful media keys at the very top and conveniently the function keys double as handy short cuts, which saved me a ton of time both in Windows and in my games for doing things like taking quick screenshots.</p>

<p>While we&rsquo;re beginning to see OLED displays pop up in gaming laptops these days, when it comes to performance for me it&rsquo;s hard to overlook something like the M16&rsquo;s ROG Nebula HDR Mini LED display which in my opinion hit the right balance between gorgeous imagery and buttery smooth motion. OLEDs make me a little anxious too since burn-in became a thing to worry about on laptops, but as a Mini LED there was no need to worry about that.</p>

<p>To be sure, the M16&rsquo;s QHD+ (2560 x 1600) Mini LED, is in every way the epitome of a bright, immensely colorful but also remarkably smooth gaming panel. With its tiny diodes that measure just 0.2 milimeters in diameter, it hits an impressive peak brightness of 1100 nits, and has a contrast ratio of 100,000:1, which is not just a metric &ndash; it&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;re really going to notice.</p>



<p>Suffice to say, the quality of images I got on the 100 percent DPI-P3 panel hit home immediately in a game of <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> where images appeared brighter and more saturated than I&rsquo;ve seen them in 16-inch rivals. Darks also looked true and immensely deep. I cross reference a lot of laptop displays and the colors appeared incredibly accurate, too &ndash; hence the panel&rsquo;s VESA Display HDR 1000, Dolby Vision and Pantone certifications.</p>

<p>But what really sold me on the M16&rsquo;s display was how fluid fast moving action appeared. Legacy technologies return in a big way to make that a reality &ndash; no less than a quick three millisecond response time, G-Sync, and a very fast 240Hz refresh rate. In regards to the latter, that&rsquo;s an upgrade from the 165Hz rate we saw in 2022, which I&rsquo;m very happy about.</p>

<p>When it comes to audio, the M16 is no slouch either; it outdoes a contingent of rival mid-range laptops thanks to a well-placed smattering of not four, but six speakers powered by Dolby Atmos. These do remarkably well to produce a sound profile that balances out nicely across the tonal spectrum, with reasonably deep-sounding lows and highs that pop through the speaker grilles clearly without sounding like they&rsquo;re getting shattered by chassis vibrations.</p>



<h2 id="asus-rog-zephyrus-m16-cpu-performance">Asus ROG Zephyrus M16: CPU performance</h2>



<p>My review unit featured an Intel 13th-gen Core i9-13900H mobile processor which packs in a total of 14 cores. This chip, which belongs to Intel&rsquo;s Raptor Lake series, and is especially designed for lightweight enthusiast gaming laptops, advances Intel&rsquo;s hybrid chip architecture to leverage 8 Efficient (E-Cores) and 6 Performance Cores (P-Cores) with a maximum of 20 Threads. Intel&rsquo;s benchmarks show it has a maximum turbo frequency of 5.4 GHz per each of its performance cores &ndash; which really pushes the upper limits of CPU performance capabilities.</p>



<p>To find out where exactly in the PCWorld&rsquo;s panoply of mid-range gaming laptops the M16&rsquo;s CPU sat, I pulled comparisons from our 2022 gaming review charts, including laptops like the Asus ROG Zephyrus Duo 16 with its AMD Ryzen 9 6900HX CPU, but I also added in 2023 laptops like the Razer Blade 16 which features a Core i9-13950HX CPU.</p>



<p>First CPU test off the blocks was Maxon&rsquo;s Cinebench R20 Multi-Threaded benchmark, a test that utilizes every core of the laptop&rsquo;s CPU. In our benchmark results you can see the M16&rsquo;s CPU squeezes every ounce of CPU power it can to hit a score of 7,352 &ndash; an impressive result which bested even the Razer Blade 16 among our comparisons.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Zephyrus M16" class="wp-image-1934988" height="599" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/M16-Cinebench-R20.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>Based on this result we can confidently say that the Intel i9-13900H is a powerful performer in the context of the M16, which in turn means it should easily power the latest AAA games and just as easily breeze through CPU-intensive tasks like encoding or video editing.</p>



<p>Following this, I looked at how well the M16&rsquo;s CPU could keep processing data faced with rising thermals. Would it need to throttle performance to keep overheating at bay, or keep up the pace to finish tasks at breakneck speed? To find out I ran a bespoke test designed specifically for the free HandBrake utility &ndash; with the objective being to see how quickly the laptop could finish encoding a 30GB MKV file to MP4 using the Android Tablet Preset.</p>



<p>As you can see in the graph below, the M16&rsquo;s i9-13900H processor did remarkably well, defeating most of the comparison field. Put simply, this means the M16 is unlikely to put the brakes on too much when the laptop heats up, which is a great news for gamers that really need consistent performance.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Zephyrus M16" class="wp-image-1934991" height="564" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/M16-HandBrake.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<h2 id="asus-rog-zephyrus-m16-gaming-performance">Asus ROG Zephyrus M16: Gaming performance</h2>



<p>Moving enough frames on a 2560&times;1600 display for decent gameplay is no mean feat &ndash; in fact, it&rsquo;s one of the reasons many gamers often opt for a 1080p panel instead. Consequently, I was very keen to see if the M16&rsquo;s RTX 4070 GPU &ndash; one of Nvidia&rsquo;s powerful new mid-range graphics cards &ndash; could do just that.</p>



<p>The mobile RTX 4070 is essentially 2023&rsquo;s answer to last year&rsquo;s mobile RTX 3070, in that it&rsquo;s meant to be the option that gamers on a budget can turn to for solid power at a still affordable price. Looking at its specifications, this GPU sports 4608 Cores, 144 of which are Nvidia Tensor Cores, designed to help improve the speed of machine learning applications. It also has 36 ray-tracing cores, which render texture and shadows better in 3D graphical applications &ndash; so theoretically, it&rsquo;s well equipped for the latest games.</p>



<p>3DMark&rsquo;s Time Spy 1.2 benchmark was my go-to performance benchmark to gage the GPU&rsquo;s graphical performance. This DirectX 12 benchmark for Windows 10/11 PCs, is especially designed to support new API features like asynchronous compute, explicit multi-adapter and multi-threading, so it&rsquo;s ideal for evaluating Nvidia&rsquo;s latest GPU releases.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Zephyrus M16" class="wp-image-1934964" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/M16-3DMark-Time-Spy-1.2.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>As you can see in the results, my laptop&rsquo;s GPU hit a high of 11,862 in the benchmark&rsquo;s &lsquo;Overall&rsquo; category, which all things considered, wasn&rsquo;t far off what the Razer Blade&rsquo;s RTX 4090 GPU hit. This result proves the RTX 4070 is a stellar option in the M16 and implies that it&rsquo;s quite capable of tackling the most graphically demanding tasks &ndash; be that games, video editing, or 3D rendering.</p>



<p>While the Time Spy 1.2 benchmark provides a scattergun glimpse of the GPU&rsquo;s capabilities, it doesn&rsquo;t really provide any information about the kinds of average frame rates you&rsquo;re likely to get in games. Next up, I ran the <em>Rise of the Tomb Raider</em> gaming benchmark. Here we see the M16&rsquo;s GPU outpaced the majority of laptops &ndash; showing quite considerably faster average frame rates than laptops with older Nvidia RTX 30 series GPUs.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Zephyrus M16" class="wp-image-1934974" height="609" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/M16-Rise-of-the-Tomb-Raider.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>Last but not least, the results of our benchmark for the game <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> are reasonably consistent with the two tests we completed above. While it&rsquo;s true that the Razer Blade 16 again has the edge on the M16 &ndash; yet again the M16 isn&rsquo;t far behind, which is testament to the kind of graphics power this machine can produce.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Zephyrus M16" class="wp-image-1934980" height="581" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/M16-Shadow-of-the-Tomb-Raider.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<h2 id="asus-rog-zephyrus-m16-battery-life">Asus ROG Zephyrus M16: Battery life</h2>



<p>The M16 featured a large 90Whr battery, but we&rsquo;ve seen before that large batteries don&rsquo;t always equate to better performance. So, to test just how long it would last, I applied PCWorld&rsquo;s in-house battery test, which meant I ran a Hollywood movie on repeat at 50 percent volume with a pair of cheap headphones inserted to keep sound to a minimum. With the keyboard backlighting turned off, the M16 lasted almost eight hours before the battery died.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Zephyrus M16" class="wp-image-1934983" height="612" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/M16-Battery-test.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>That&rsquo;s not the best I&rsquo;ve seen this year &ndash; the Asus TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition holds that title at more than 11 hours, but it&rsquo;s one of the better results and nothing to sneeze at either. That means in a real-time gaming scenario, you can expect about four hours of gaming time away from an outlet before you&rsquo;ll need to plug back in and recharge.</p>



<h2 id="asus-rog-zephyrus-m16-should-you-buy-it">Asus ROG Zephyrus M16: Should you buy it?</h2>



<p>While the 2023 Zephyrus M16 does a novel thing with the Zephyrus brand, focusing more on decadent power upgrades than continuing the trend towards a lighter and thinner chassis &ndash; this change nevertheless actually makes it one of the best 16-inch options in 2023.</p>



<p>For gamers looking for a reasonably light and portable laptop that&rsquo;ll produce quick frame rates at 2560&times;1600, it&rsquo;s very hard to look beyond the M16. What&rsquo;s more, you can expect to pay a little less than some competitors for the privilege. While a mushy keyboard and more modest styling may be irksome for some gamers, this laptop gets everything mostly right, which is no small feat.</p>
