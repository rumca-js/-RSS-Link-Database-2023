The gameplay is being \"evolved,\" but the story isn't changing.

Metal Gear is one of Konami's biggest franchises, but it's been on the backburner following creator Hideo Kojima's departure and the awful Metal Gear Survive.\n\nThus, one has to ask: Is Konami suddenly the good guy? Does it deserve a second chance, especially with other highly-anticipated announcements and core gaming moves this year? It's a tough question, especially given its troubling history.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0efL5UeZcQ", "date_published": "2023-06-06 13:30:20+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
