Maygen and the Birdwatcher released their debut album, Moonshine, in 2021, almost instantly earning accolades from the Midwest Country Music Awards for Album of the Year and Americana Artist of the Year.

Last October, Maygen and the Birdwatcher released the follow-up album, Bootleggin’ At The Flower Shoppe. The band visited The Current studio to play three songs for Radio Heartland. Watch their performance of "He Ain't Me," above.
