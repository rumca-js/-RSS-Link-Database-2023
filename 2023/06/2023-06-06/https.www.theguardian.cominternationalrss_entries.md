<p>A lavatorial brush with royalty precedes a day in court for our sketch writer</p><p>Surreal moment, number one. It’s 10 minutes before proceedings are due to start and a visit to the gents is in order. Outside I find a muscle-bound security guard with an earpiece. He seems friendly enough and doesn’t try to stop me entering. Inside there is only one other man, Prince Harry, washing his hands. We look at each other and both do a double-take. Thinking the same thought: “What the hell are you doing here?” But we’re both thoroughly British. So we just smile at one another and say “hello”. He then dries his hands and leaves. My brush with royalty.</p><p>Surreal moment, number two. Prince Harry being in court 15 of the Rolls Building at all. I mean, WTF? The royals normally go out of their way to avoid controversy.

## Reward or redemption? World Test Championship final looks entirely different for Australia and India | Geoff Lemon

<p>While the two nations face off at The Oval, cricket fans will also be wondering about the future of the fixture</p><p>Soon it will arrive: not just the second Test of the English summer, but the second edition of the World Test Championship final. As Australia and India prepare to play off in London, the match’s place and placement remain strange. It is new enough that people are not sure of its significance, and the supposed pinnacle of a two-year contest takes place only days before the next edition begins with an Ashes series that for many is more anticipated.</p><p>For Australia’s team the final is two things. First, reward for a solid two years of qualifying that saw only three losses out of 19, headed by a hard-fought series win across 15 days in Pakistan, as well as a home Ashes thrashing, a shared result in Sri Lanka, and a visit to India that became more credible as it went on. Second, it is essentially a free hit, a first swing at a title that Australia has never contested and has no blueprint on how to approach.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/07/cricket-world-test-championship-final-australia-india">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Pulitzer prize-winning musical shows the world what it’s like ‘to travel in a fat, Black queer body’. Writer Michael R Jackson, a former Lion King usher who based it on his life, relives his astounding success</p><p></p><p></p><p>In the bowels of the brutalist Barbican, the young cast of A Strange Loop are having a tea break. It’s a concept foreign to the musical’s writer, Michael R Jackson. “The first time I got to England,” he says, “I was like, ‘Oh right, I’m American.’ It’s a totally different culture. Like taking tea twice a day during rehearsal – we don’t do that in the US. It takes some getting used to.”</p><p>This month, we’ll see whether his show, A Strange Loop, manages to bridge the cultural divide. In the US, it couldn’t have been more highly praised: it won the Pulitzer prize for drama in 2020, then <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/17/a-strange-loop-review-michael-r-jacksons-thrilling-broadway-triumph">transferred to Broadway in 2022</a> where it picked up two Tonys, including best musical. Alan Cumming was so impressed he invested money in it, and says of Jackson: “It takes such balls to be so vulnerable and to say, ‘This is my story, I’m writing about what I think, and some of it’s not very nice, some of it’s ugly.’ He doesn’t care about offending or not looking good and ultimately it makes it all the better.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/06/sex-strange-loop-queer-black-broadway-megasmash-michael-r-jackson-lion-king-usher">Continue reading...</a>

Sign up for the full article here</a></strong></p><p>Yesterday, Apple finally confirmed the worst-kept secret in Silicon Valley, and announced the Vision Pro, its $3,499 virtual reality headset. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/05/apple-vision-pro-ar-headset-revealed-worldwide-developers-conference">From our story</a>:</p><p>The headset allows users to interact with “apps and experiences”, the Apple vice-president of human interface design, Alan Dye, said, in an augmented reality (AR) version of their own surroundings or in a fully immersive virtual reality (VR) space.</p><p>“Apple Vision Pro relies solely on your eyes, hands and voice,” Dye said. “You browse the system simply by looking. App icons come to life when you look at them; simply tap your fingers together to select, and gently flick to scroll.”</p><p>EyeSight, which sounded so ridiculous, could actually … work? A curved, outward-facing OLED screen displays the wearer’s eyes to the outside world, giving the impression of the headset as a simple piece of translucent glass. The screen mists over if the wearer is in a fully immersive VR space, while allowing people to have (simulated, at least) eye contact when in AR mode.</p><p>An array of downward and outward-pointing IR cameras let the headset keep track of your position and gestures at all times, allowing the company to build a controller-free experience without requiring the wearer to hold their hands in their eye-line when using the headset.</p><p>An AI-powered “persona” (don’t call it an avatar) stands in for you when you make a video call using the Vision Pro. It’s a photorealistic attempt to animate a real picture of you, using the data the headset captures of your eye, mouth and hand movements while you talk. Even in the staged demos, it looked slightly uncanny, but it seems a far smaller hurdle to introduce into the world than trying to encourage people to have business meetings with their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/17/bitmoji-emoji-avatar-app-downloaded-ios-apple-facebook">Memoji</a>.</p><p>Should VR headsets have a bulky battery mounted on your head, or should they rely on a tethered cable to a separate PC? Apple thinks there’s a third option: slip the bulky battery in your back pocket, and run the cable up to a lighter, more comfortable set of goggles. It could work. Or it could be the worst of both worlds: a cable that still inhibits movement and comfort, with none of the power of a real tethered VR system. Hey, not all novelty is a slam-dunk.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/06/apples-3500-vr-headset-is-the-vision-pro-more-than-just-another-tech-toy-for-the-rich">Continue reading...</a>

The reasons for forgoing all that new business are entirely economic.

Those things are owed largely to the wildfires engulfing bigger parts of the state in bigger chunks of the year.</p><p>California’s woes have <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/noaa-wildfire/wildfire-climate-connection">a lot to do</a> with the climate crisis, which fuels the hot, dry conditions that turn wooded hills into kindling.

<p>Labour leader to tell GMB union that his party would create a ‘new business model for Britain’</p><p>Good morning. There is some good polling around for Keir Starmer and Labour today – Redfield and Wilton Strategies has Starmer leading Rishi Sunak <a href="https://twitter.com/RedfieldWilton/status/1665757942300172288">on every single leadership trait polled</a>, Survation has the Tory lead over Labour in the 100 most rural English seats down from 39 points in 2019 <a href="https://www.survation.com/conservatives-face-losses-in-rural-strongholds/">to just 5 points now</a> – but this morning Starmer has to give a speech to a union whose leader <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/05/keir-starmer-gmb-union-energy-policy-north-sea-oil-gas">has strongly criticised Labour’s energy policy</a>.</p><p>Starmer will respond by telling the GMB that Labour’s plan to transition to clean energy will create jobs for its members. “Jobs – good, union jobs – will be fundamental to cleaner, safer work, new and better infrastructure for Britain,” he will say.</p><p><strong>Starmer will claim Sunak would be happy to see the rest of the UK fall behind London. </strong>He will say:</p><p>I’m not even sure [the Conservatives] see the problem. If the City of London races ahead while the rest of Britain stagnates, as long as there was a hint of growth on his spreadsheet, Rishi Sunak would think that’s fine. But it’s not.</p><p>If you leave this many people behind, a nation cannot grow fairly. We can’t do it with low wages. We can’t do it with insecure jobs and bad work, with a stand-aside state that doesn’t fight for the future, without a proper industrial strategy.</p><p><strong>Starmer will accuse the Tories of being willing to see British industry fail. </strong>He will say:</p><p>For too long, Britain has allowed the opportunities of the new energy technologies to pass us by. Without a plan, the energy industries we rely on will wither and decline.</p><p>The Tories think it’s the market doing its job when British industry falls behind. It’s not some glitch in their model – it is the model.</p><p><strong>He will say defend Labour’s plans, saying “holding back the future” won’t lead to growth. </strong>He will say:</p><p>There is no way to growth in Britain in holding back the future. But equally, there is no way to growth that doesn’t involve bending and shaping it.</p><p>We can create a new business model for Britain, one which creates economic security and grows not just our productivity, but our hope and our optimism.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/jun/06/keir-starmer-labour-rishi-sunak-conservatives-uk-politics-latest-news">Continue reading...</a>

## My husband watches porn during sex. It makes me feel useless and unattractive

<p>I am starting to feel seriously resentful towards him. After three decades together, what is the best way forward?</p><p><strong>My husband and I have been married for 31 years. We have an active sex life (four to five times a week)</strong><strong> but I am </strong><strong>feeling serious resentment towards him</strong><strong>. Quite honestly, I am disgusted by him at times.</strong> <strong>He seems unable to orgasm through vaginal sex, and can also only reach a climax with porn turned on, which I don’t like. No matter how much we discuss this or I explain my hurt, he continues to do it anyway. I feel useless and no longer attractive. I’m not an</strong><strong> eye</strong><strong>sore of a person. I’m damn hot for 51!</strong><strong> What is wrong with him/me?</strong></p><p>I imagine that the impasse you are experiencing with your husband is not limited to sexual situations. Communication has become difficult and you are engaged in a power struggle. It is understandable that you feel angry and have a great deal of resentment towards him – which in itself will lower your desire for him. Your self-esteem is also suffering and no one likes to be ignored, so couples counselling with a good therapist who is knowledgable about sex therapy is going to be your best chance to have a more palatable relationship. You may be tempted to give him an ultimatum to let him know you are serious about getting help as the only way to save your marriage … but make sure you are ready for either consequence.</p><p>Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</p><p>If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to <a href="mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com">private.lives@theguardian.com</a> (please don’t send attachments).

Kathleen Folbigg was convicted in 2003 of killing her four children, Caleb, Patrick, Sarah and Laura. It is now accepted that her children could quite possibly have died of natural causes. She was finally released from prison on Monday.</p><p>Folbigg was released because commissioner Tom Bathurst, who is conducting an inquiry into her convictions, has reached the “firm view” that there is reasonable doubt about Folbigg’s guilt. He has not yet completed his report, and this task should not be rushed. Instead, he has provided information to the New South Wales attorney general, Michael Daley, about why he has concluded that Folbigg is not guilty of killing her children. To his credit, the attorney general has moved quickly and decisively to pardon Folbigg.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/29/email-newsletters-guardian-australia-best-daily-news-emails-newsletter-free-sign-up-inbox-subscribe-headlines?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon</a></strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/29/email-newsletters-guardian-australia-best-daily-news-emails-newsletter-free-sign-up-inbox-subscribe-headlines?CMP=copyembed"> </a><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/29/email-newsletters-guardian-australia-best-daily-news-emails-newsletter-free-sign-up-inbox-subscribe-headlines?CMP=copyembed">email newsletters for your daily news roundup</a></strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/06/kathleen-folbigg-demonised-by-australia-legal-system-trial-pardon-release">Continue reading...</a>
