Then, warns Mark Diacono, author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/herb-9781787136359\">Herb</a>, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/spice-9781787136434\">Spice</a> and <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/sour-9781787132269\">Sour</a>, \u201cyou don\u2019t want to premix something in which one element is fizzy and another sharp [think lemon or lime juice], because it will totally lose its sharpness over time.\u201d And you <em>really</em> don\u2019t want anything too potent \u2013 after all, Burgess says, \u201cdrinking in the day can take its toll\u201d.</p><p>For all these reasons, shrubs (or drinking vinegars) are a good strategy, especially when the summer fruit glut arrives, Burgess says: \u201cPick your fruit, then heat it with caster sugar and verjus, which has a much softer acid balance than cider or white-wine vinegar.\u201d Bottle it up and keep in the fridge or freezer, \u201cready to be topped with soda water and fresh lemon or lime juice\u201d at your outdoor destination. Happily, shrubs pair well with vodka and gin, too, should the mood take you.</p><p>Got a culinary dilemma?

The woozy rush from icy beers creeping up in the afternoon sun, the giddy delirium a sleep-deprived brain somehow manages to pump out, those blissful moments when you truly forget the outside world. From boozy teenage rites of passage using your sunken tent as a sleeping bag to 5am raves in mud pits, festivals supply key life experiences and have become ingrained in British culture. They can be wild, filthy, hilarious, sodden, blissful things to be enjoyed and endured alike.</p><p>However, looking at a number of 2023 UK festivals, there\u2019s a creeping sense of uniformity.

With fancy food and drink, talks, wellness, and a host of other curated experiences becoming the norm, many music festivals are feeling more akin to a lifestyle retreat, large-scale street food market, academic conference, or neighbourhood street party in a leafy affluent suburb.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jun/06/festivals-now-feel-like-a-cross-between-a-spa-and-a-gastropub-what-about-the-music\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jun/06/festivals-now-feel-like-a-cross-between-a-spa-and-a-gastropub-what-about-the-music", "date_published": "2023-06-06 09:49:40+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Kiss review \u2013 typically explosive end to rock\u2019s silliest band", "description": "<p><strong>Resorts World Arena, Birmingham</strong><br />The solos are dull, the banter crass, the songs often lacking in interest \u2013 and yet Kiss\u2019s final tour is also a barrage of amazement</p><p>And so Kiss roll into Britain for their third last-ever-time.

The subject that dominates this not-to-be-missed debut is the discovery of an infant mass grave in Tuam, County Galway, the existence of which was only officially acknowledged in 2017. The wretched tale is that from 1925-1961, \u201cfallen women\u201d were sent to the inappropriately named <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/03/mass-grave-of-babies-and-children-found-at-tuam-orphanage-in-ireland\">Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home</a>, run by nuns. Exactly how so many babies failed to survive is not clear but injustice, cruelty and grief surge through the poems. At the same time and strangely, even at their darkest, there is at times a fairytale quality to this writing \u2013 magic in its margins.</p><p>The title suggests a readiness for a good gossip but while <a href=\"https://www.majellakelly.com/home-1\">Kelly </a>is captivatingly conversational, she is preoccupied by what it means for women to be silenced. Voice is about one of the unmarried mothers gagged by shame \u2013 and Kelly\u2019s sureness of touch is evident in the accurate rurality of \u201ccut nettles in empty cups\u201d, as anyone who has uprooted a nettle and witnessed its speedy wilt can confirm. The final lines of the poem are frightening in their crematorial helplessness: \u201cBut when I opened my mouth to cry out,/I spoke only in a thin grey wisp of smoke.\u201d The plain simplicity of the nouns is exactly right (nettles, fireplace, smoke) \u2013 she does not get in the way of her subject. Elsewhere, though, there are poems that possibly over-tell the scandalous story. Clean begins: \u201cDead is the happiest we ever were\u2026\u201d The line\u2019s authoritative flow cannot override the bitter falseness of the attestation \u2013 death being no happiness at all. And there are times when Kelly is over-reliant on lists of nouns such as strings of beads, poetic rosaries \u2013 although at their best (especially in I Am From) these have their uses.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/06/the-speculations-of-country-people-by-majella-kelly-review-crimes-and-punishment\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/06/the-speculations-of-country-people-by-majella-kelly-review-crimes-and-punishment", "date_published": "2023-06-06 08:00:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Sue Gray cleared to take up Labour job this autumn", "description": "<p>Watchdog says ex-civil servant must wait six months to start job rather than the maximum delay of two years</p><p>The former civil servant Sue Gray has been cleared to take up her new role as Keir Starmer\u2019s chief of staff in the autumn after a vetting board rejected calls for her to have a much longer period of gardening leave.</p><p>Gray, who led the investigation into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/partygate\">Partygate</a> last year, took ministers by surprise with a plan to quit the civil service and work for Labour.
