It\u2019s undoubtedly the best AR/VR experience we\u2019ve seen yet, but there are still plenty of issues Apple needs to solve.</p><p>Listen below or subscribe on your podcast app of choice.

This means that eager users will be able to install the various betas starting today, including <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/heres-everything-apple-announced-at-wwdc-2023-223303827.html\">iOS 17</a>, for free versus having to wait until July for the public beta. That is, as long as they have an Apple Developer account.</p><p>After WWDC yesterday, Apple <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-accidentally-released-the-ios-17-developer-beta-to-the-public-155233150.html\">released the iOS 17 developer beta</a>, and unlike previous years, those on the free tier now have access. While it previously appeared as if opening up access to free accounts meant that the public could also download these, we now understand that not just anyone can access the developer betas. You'll need to have an Apple ID or account that's enrolled in the Developer Program. The $99 barrier to entry, though, has been removed.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>\u200b\u200bEarlier this year, Apple made a change to how it distributes betas to developers. Previously, developers had to download and install a configuration profile on a per-device basis. But the system now allows users to install betas by simply checking an option within the software update settings directly on their devices. Despite the change, Apple still required you to pay $99 per year in order to gain access to the developer betas. Now, users that don\u2019t want to pay the fee won\u2019t have to wait for the public beta, which was always available for free but typically is released later than developer betas. This year, Apple says the public betas should arrive in July.</p><p>We highly discourage running betas on your main devices as there can be bugs and issues, especially early on in the cycle. These betas are intended for developers, who typically have secondary devices to test their applications against the new software. Certain betas, such as those for <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-apple-watch-embraces-widgets-again-in-watchos-10-180838970.html\">watchOS 10</a>, tvOS 17, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/homepod-mini-spatial-audio-apple-music-lossless-support-beta-210300048.html\">HomePod</a> 17 and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/airpods-pro-firmware-update-spatial-audio-083143292.html\">AirPods</a> prevent you from rolling back to public, stable software. For those platforms, as soon as you install the beta, you\u2019ll be stuck on it until the next public release comes out, which is typically available later in the fall. Definitely install these betas at your own risk. But those who aren\u2019t risk-averse and are part of the developer program can download these now.</p><p><strong><em>Update (at 10:15pm ET):</em></strong><em> This article was updated to clarify that while the developer betas are now available to those with free accounts, it was not an accident, nor is it open to just anyone. You will need to have an Apple ID or account associated with the developer program to be able to download the developer betas.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apples-developer-betas-are-now-free-to-download-and-install-213626729.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/apples-developer-betas-are-now-free-to-download-and-install-213626729.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-06 21:36:26+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Apple bought the AR company behind the tech in Nintendo\u2019s \u2018Mario Kart\u2019 ride", "description": "<p>Apple has reportedly bought AR startup Mira.

Passkey is the proposed solution to end passwords for good that\u2019s finally starting to gain some momentum. The technology uses your device\u2019s biometric sensors \u2013 whether that\u2019s fingerprint or facial recognition \u2013 to authenticate you. It\u2019s not too dissimilar to using biometrics to unlock your phone.</p><p>Announced via a <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/save-sign-in-passkeys-1password/\">press release</a>, 1Password says that starting today, you\u2019ll be able to add passkey logins via the password manager. For example, when you create a passkey for your Google account, 1Password will detect that and add it to your 1Password account. Then, when you need to log in to your Google account next, 1Password will automatically log you in. So, as long as your fingers aren\u2019t wet or <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ios-154-face-id-mask-siri-macos-ipados-202344945.html\">your face isn\u2019t obscured</a>, you won\u2019t need a password.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The company says that support will start with beta extensions for Safari on macOS, as well as Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Brave on macOS, Windows and Linux. You'll also be able to view, edit, move, share and delete passkeys on 1Password for Mac, iOS, Windows, Android and Linux.&nbsp;</p><p>With the wide adoption of biometrics on phones, tablets, and laptops, this seems like a logical next step. If you were using a password manager like 1Password, you were likely already using biometrics to autofill logins on websites and apps. It sounds like passkeys will remove the step of having to autofill a username and a password, in addition to having to press the login button entirely.</p><p>Because 1Password is platform agnostic, it will work for those who regularly switch operating systems or entire ecosystems. Unlike <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apples-passkeys-offer-even-better-protection-for-you-passwords-190334447.html\">Apple</a> or <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-passkey-support-android-chrome-164017230.html\">Google\u2019s current implementations</a>, 1Password works and syncs across ecosystems. And just like any other item in 1Password, you\u2019ll be able to share your passkeys with friends and family, and even set time limits on how long they\u2019ll have access.</p><div id=\"1bb6e4a56fe44d3386e12898938102a1\"></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/passkey-support-for-1password-arrives-in-beta-today-183010530.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/passkey-support-for-1password-arrives-in-beta-today-183010530.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-06 18:30:10+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Western Digital's first Xbox Series X/S storage cards start at $80", "description": "<p>Until now, you've had to buy a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-permanently-drops-the-price-of-xbox-series-xs-storage-192456920.html\">Seagate card</a> if you wanted to augment the fast internal storage of your Xbox Series X or S.

That's $10 less than the recently price-cut Seagate equivalent, and easier to justify if you only need room for a few extra games. A 1TB card sells for the same $150 as its comparably-sized rival.</p><p>You'll need one of these proprietary add-ons if you want to add space for ready-to-play Xbox Series X/S games, which require solid-state drive cards that are as quick as the SSD built into the console. Conventional external USB drives can only be used to archive games or play Xbox One titles. That's fine if you only have a handful of active games at a time, but you'll want an Xbox-native card if you want access to many titles at short notice.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>These cards are still costlier than the NVMe SSDs you can <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-ps5-ssd-expansion-upgrade-150052315.html\">buy for a PlayStation 5</a>. However, the price gap is now small enough that the storage format probably won't affect your choice of system. It's only an issue if you want 2TB of additional capacity. Western Digital doesn't offer a 2TB C50 card, and Seagate's $280 Xbox option is decidedly more expensive than PS5 options like Sabrent's $160 NVMe drive.</p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/western-digitals-first-xbox-series-xs-storage-cards-start-at-80-171723507.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/western-digitals-first-xbox-series-xs-storage-cards-start-at-80-171723507.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-06 17:17:23+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Chinese startup says its new EV battery doesn\u2019t lose range in the cold", "description": "<p>The Chinese startup Greater Bay Technology claims its latest EV battery can charge at normal speeds even in cold temperatures.

The big sacrifice is its lack of an always-on display mode, so you'll have to physically lift up your wrist to check the time or notifications. Beyond that, its display is slightly smaller, it doesn't support fast charging and it lacks more advanced health-tracking features like a skin temperature sensor, ECG monitor and blood oxygen sensor.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Those won't be massive omissions for many people, though, and the SE keeps the rest of the Apple Watch experience largely intact.

In short, stories written by its in-house artificial intelligence \u2014 which it calls Responsible AI Machine Partner (RAMP) \u2014 are no more, but the specter of AI in its newsroom is far from exorcised.&nbsp;</p><p>The site indicates, however, that there are still two broad categories of pursuits where RAMP will be deployed. The first, which it calls &quot;Organizing large amounts of information&quot; provides an example that seems more authorial than that umbrella descriptor lets on. &quot;RAMP will help us sort things like pricing and availability data and present it in ways that tailor information to certain audiences. Without an AI assist, this volume of work wouldn\u2019t be possible.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The other (&quot;Speeding up certain research and administrative portions of our workflow.&quot;) is more troubling. &quot;CNET editors could use AI to help automate some portions of our work so we can focus on the parts that add the most unique value,&quot; the guidelines state.&quot;RAMP <strong>may also generate content such as explanatory material</strong> (based on trusted sources) that a human could fact-check and edit. [emphasis ours]&quot; You'd be forgiven if that sounds nearly identical to what got <em>CNET</em> into trouble in the first place.</p><p>The venerable tech site first posted an innocuously titled explainer (&quot;<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/advice/what-is-a-credit-card-charge-off/\">What Is a Credit Card Charge-Off?</a>&quot;) on November 11, 2022, under the byline &quot;CNET Money Staff&quot; with no further explanation as to its provenance, and continued posting dozens more small finance stories under that byline through mid-January. It was around that time that <em>Futurism</em><a href=\"https://futurism.com/cnet-ai-articles-label\">discovered</a> two important details: CNET Money Staff stories were AI-generated, and much of that work was wildly inaccurate. <em>CNET</em> issued corrections on over half of those stories and had, by all appearances, stopped using these sorts of tools in response to the deserved criticisms they created.</p><p>In the interim, the remaining <em>CNET</em> staff publicly announced their <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/after-layoffs-and-an-ai-scandal-cnets-staff-are-unionizing-161508890.html\">intention to unionize</a> with the Writer's Guide of America, East. Among the more typical areas of concern for a shrinking newsroom during these trying times in the media industry (retention, severance, editorial independence, et cetera), the bargaining unit also specifically pushed back against the site's intention to keep deploying AI.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on the union's response on Twitter, the guidelines fall well short of the kinds of protections <em>CNET</em>'s workers were hoping for. &quot;Before the tool rolls out, our union looks forward to negotiating,&quot; they wrote. &quot;How &amp; what data is retrieved; a regular role in testing/reevaluating tool; right to opt out &amp; remove bylines; a voice to ensure editorial integrity.</p><div id=\"d3f597c3493b485fb440ef23ec5e25a0\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">New AI policy <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CNET?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@CNET</a> affects workers.

However, the new guidelines leave the door open for that possibility, as well as the eventuality that it uses AI to generate images or videos, promising only that where &quot;text that originated from our AI tool, we\u2019ll include that information in a disclosure.&quot; <em>CNET's</em> apparent bullishness on AI (and its staff's wariness) also arrive against a backdrop of news organizations broadly looking to survive the technology's potential ill-effects. <em>The New York Times</em> and other media groups began <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/06/news-organizations-ai-disinformation.html\">preliminary talks</a> this week to discuss AI's role in disinformation and plagiarism, as well as how to ensure fair compensation when authorship becomes murky.</p><p>The prior CNET Money Staff articles have since been updated to reflect the new editorial guidelines. Each is credited to a human staff member who has rewritten the story and also lists the name of the overseeing editor. Each is now appended with the following note at the bottom &quot;Editors\u2019 note: An earlier version of this article was assisted by an AI engine. This version has been substantially updated by a staff writer.&quot;</p><p>This sort of basic disclosure is neither difficult nor unusual. Including the provenance of information has been one of the core tenants of journalism since well before AI became advanced enough to get a credit on the masthead, and The Associated Press has been including such disclosures in its cut-and-paste-level financial beat stories <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/29/7939067/ap-journalism-automation-robots-financial-reporting\">for the better part of a decade</a>. On the one hand much of the embarrassment around <em>CNET</em>'s gaffe could have been avoided if it had simply warned readers where the text of these stories had come from at the outset. But the larger concern remains that, unlike AP's use of these tools, <em>CNET</em> seems poised to allow RAMP more freedom to do more substantive work, the bounds of which are not meaningfully changed by these guidelines.</p><p><strong>Correction, June 6th, 2023, 11:47am ET: </strong>An earlier version of this story inaccurately described how the altered stories previously written by CNET Money Staff appeared on page.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cnets-new-guidelines-for-ai-journalism-met-with-union-pushback-152311269.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/cnets-new-guidelines-for-ai-journalism-met-with-union-pushback-152311269.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-06 15:23:11+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "SEC sues Coinbase over alleged violations of securities laws", "description": "<p>Another day, another regulatory action against a major cryptocurrency company.

If you\u2019re looking to spend only what you absolutely must on your next laptop, we\u2019ve got a number of top picks for you to consider, plus some shopping advice that can help you choose the best budget laptop for you.</p><h2>What to look for in a budget laptop</h2><p>First, we at Engadget consider anything under $1,000 to be \u201cbudget\u201d in the laptop space. The reason for this is twofold: even the most affordable flagship laptops typically start at $1,000 or more, and if you go dramatically lower than that (say, $500 or less), that\u2019s where you\u2019ll really start to see compromises in performance. You\u2019ll typically find the best balance of power and price in the $500 to $1,000 range. But in this guide, we\u2019ll cover top picks at a wide range of prices \u2014 there are a number of options on the low and high end of the budget spectrum.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Arguably the biggest thing to look for in a budget laptop is a decent spec sheet. You might be able to find options with the latest generation CPU chipsets, or you may have to go for one that has a slightly older processor. We recommend trying to find a notebook with the most up-to-date internals as possible, but know that if you pick a machine with a CPU that\u2019s one generation behind, it probably will not significantly affect performance.</p><p>Along with processors, you should also consider the amount of memory and storage you need in a daily driver. For the former, we recommend laptops with at least 8GB of RAM; anything with less than that will have a hard time multitasking and managing all those browser tabs. The latter is a bit more personal: how much onboard storage you need really depends on how many apps, files, photos, documents and more you will save locally. As a general rule of thumb, try to go for a laptop that has at least a 256GB SSD (this only goes for macOS and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-affordable-windows-laptops-123000512.html\">Windows</a> machines, as Chromebooks are a bit different). That should give you enough space for programs and files, plus room for future operating system updates.</p><p>After determining the best performance you can get while sticking to your budget, it\u2019s also worth examining a few different design aspects. We recommend picking a machine with a mostly metal body, a screen that has at least a 1080p resolution and a keyboard and trackpad area that\u2019s relatively spacious. Any laptop worth purchasing will have a built-in webcam, but most of them top out at 720p. A few of the latest models have 1080p webcams, but you may want to consider a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-webcams-123047068.html\">standalone peripheral</a> if you spend a ton of time on Zoom meetings.</p><p>Be sure to check out the port situation as well. Many laptops closer to $1,000 will have fewer ports than their more affordable counterparts (as counterintuitive as that may seem). You\u2019ll find at least one or two USB-C ports on the newest machines, which means you may need a separate dongle if you frequently have to connect to SD cards.</p><h2>A note about refurbished laptops</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/where-to-buy-refurbished-tech-140028700.html\">Refurbished laptops</a> are another option to consider if you need a new machine and don\u2019t want to spend a ton of money. Buying refurbished tech can be tricky if you\u2019re unfamiliar with a brand\u2019s or merchant\u2019s policies surrounding what they classify as \u201crefurbished.\u201d But it\u2019s not impossible \u2014 for laptops, we recommend going directly to the manufacturer for refurbished devices. <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0MTMwZTJmMC1hMTRmLTRjNWUtYmRhYi1jZDUyYWM3ZDhlNzkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL3Nob3AvcmVmdXJiaXNoZWQvbWFjIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIxNzMwMzZmNy03ZjQ1LTQ0MDItYmIwYS1lYzVjMWFiNmM2YzYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAYqgdD7wRzz3Yxykvn_ekitalDjD6hcttZtmO3xR3PLh&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fmac\">Apple</a>, <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=bf09206f-28ed-413b-ad0d-fdf6f9fe5221&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Dell+Refurbished+Computers&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJiZjA5MjA2Zi0yOGVkLTQxM2ItYWQwZC1mZGY2ZjlmZTUyMjEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGVsbHJlZnVyYmlzaGVkLmNvbS9sYXB0b3BzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIxNzMwMzZmNy03ZjQ1LTQ0MDItYmIwYS1lYzVjMWFiNmM2YzYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQ5k9VDVbOlFdXJAViHBTQksOxksWfD9tEUndzssDOKx&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dellrefurbished.com%2Flaptops\">Dell</a> and <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=67071605-d4df-494e-8d9c-c9c236b8bb38&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Microsoft&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NzA3MTYwNS1kNGRmLTQ5NGUtOGQ5Yy1jOWMyMzZiOGJiMzgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWljcm9zb2Z0LmNvbS9lbi11cy9zdG9yZS9iL2NlcnRpZmllZC1yZWZ1cmJpc2hlZC1wcm9kdWN0cyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMTczMDM2ZjctN2Y0NS00NDAyLWJiMGEtZWM1YzFhYjZjNmM2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAf4rSU9DYnklIUrjIDJUR5L3O8BEVnNRWgrEhfkMGHLx&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fstore%2Fb%2Fcertified-refurbished-products\">Microsoft</a> all have official refurbishment processes that their devices go through before they\u2019re put back on the market that verifies the machines work properly and are in good condition.

The first machine with Apple\u2019s custom system-on-a-chip, the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-140031323.html\">Air M1</a> was released at the end of 2020 and proved that the company didn\u2019t need Intel to power its notebooks anymore. The M1 processor gave the Air blazing fast performance, with a responsiveness akin to that of an iPad Pro. That hasn\u2019t changed even after the launch of the M2 chipset and the latest Air powered by it. You\u2019re still going to get impressive performance from the MacBook Air M1 that will be just right for most people as a daily driver.</p><p>The Air M1 has the classic wedge design we\u2019ve seen in this family of notebooks for years, which some will appreciate. It may not be the refined profile that the M2 machine has, but it\u2019s still thin and light, and since it lacks a fan, it\u2019ll be super quiet as well. The 13.3-inch Retina display is lovely, and it\u2019s accompanied by a comfortable keyboard (sans TouchBar) and a spacious trackpad. Battery life clocked in at nearly 16.5 hours in our testing, which will be more than enough for a full day\u2019s work. It may be at the top end of our budget price range, starting at $999, but it will be money well spent. Also, we\u2019ve frequently seen the MacBook Air M1 drop to $800 or $900 when it goes on sale at Amazon and other retailers.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-140031323.html\"><strong>Read our full review of the Apple MacBook Air M1</strong></a></p><h2>Best budget Windows laptop: HP Pavilion Aero 13</h2><p></p><p>If you like the general aesthetics of machines like Dell\u2019s XPS 13 but don\u2019t want to pay $1,000 or more, the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8a0e8870-4cf8-4bda-935c-af7c00c28e2b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=HP+Store&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4YTBlODg3MC00Y2Y4LTRiZGEtOTM1Yy1hZjdjMDBjMjhlMmIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaHAuY29tL3VzLWVuL3Nob3AvbWRwL2xhcHRvcHMvaHAtcGF2aWxpb24tYWVybyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMTczMDM2ZjctN2Y0NS00NDAyLWJiMGEtZWM1YzFhYjZjNmM2In0&amp;signature=AQAAARfA4FwDix1sU9Q0QsO4OzDf2egiBJxUBBsSdJBBq0NS&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fmdp%2Flaptops%2Fhp-pavilion-aero\">HP Pavilion Aero</a> is your best bet. We gave it a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/hp-pavilion-aero-13-review-powerful-and-cheap-143034549.html\">score of 87</a> in our review and compared it to Dell\u2019s flagship laptop. It\u2019s certainly not as sleek as that machine, but it comes pretty close with its angled profile, 2.2-pound weight and its anti-glare 13.3-inch display. Despite its keyboard being a little cramped, it\u2019s a solid typing machine and we appreciate all of its connectivity options: one USB-C port, two USB-A ports, an HDMI connector and a headphone jack. You can currently pick an Aero 13 up for as low as $800, but they have gone on sale for even less. All of the prebuilt models available from HP directly come with Ryzen 5 processors, and you can customize the laptop to have up to a Ryzen 7 CPU, 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/hp-pavilion-aero-13-review-powerful-and-cheap-143034549.html\"><strong>Read our full review of the HP Pavilion Aero 13</strong></a></p><h2>Best Chromebook: Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5i</h2><p></p><p>It\u2019s been a couple of years since we named <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9MZW5vdm8tMi0xLUNocm9tZWJvb2stQ29tcHV0ZXIvZHAvQjA5Uk5DTjNZVj90aD0xJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTExcS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMTczMDM2ZjctN2Y0NS00NDAyLWJiMGEtZWM1YzFhYjZjNmM2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAaFPSlCk9NmHLlRZ6VzYN5arHUO_pPaf1wuKblUVH7hX&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLenovo-2-1-Chromebook-Computer%2Fdp%2FB09RNCN3YV%3Fth%3D1\">Lenovo\u2019s IdeaPad Flex 5i</a> our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-chromebooks-160054646.html\">favorite Chromebook</a> and it remains our top pick today.

The company scrapped this plan at the end of 2022 amid concerns governments could pressure it to scan for other image types, not to mention risks of false positives.

Below, we\u2019ve rounded up a selection of our favorite gaming-related gear, from consoles and controllers, to artwork and coffee table books.</p><h2>8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller</h2><p></p><p>The <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwQjlCR0pWTEwvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTExZS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYmI4YjljN2UtOGE5ZC00Zjc5LThmMzQtYmVmMzgyMGM3NzU0In0&amp;signature=AQAAAR7VWh8tDMUis77DWfD1hjOfDT4gqW7Gi0Vk0Y05rRe-&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0B9BGJVLL%2F\">8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller</a> is a versatile alternative to Nintendo\u2019s Switch Pro Controller that also works easily on PC. It connects over Bluetooth, a wireless dongle, or a USB cable and notably uses <a href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/829622/what-is-a-hall-effect-joystick-and-why-dont-they-develop-drift/\">magnetic Hall effect sensors</a> in its joysticks, which means it\u2019s much less susceptible to developing the dreaded \u201c<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-offers-unlimited-free-repairs-for-joy-con-drift-issue-in-europe-062645235.html\">stick drift</a>\u201d than traditional controllers. While it might feel a <em>little</em> cramped for those with particularly large hands, its shape doesn\u2019t have any weird curves or quirks, and all its inputs are appropriately crisp to press. Battery life is solid at 20-ish hours, too, and the whole thing comes with a slick charging dock. If dad wants to get hardcore, <a href=\"https://support.8bitdo.com/ultimate/ultimate-bluetooth-controller.html\">8BitDo\u2019s companion app</a> offers a wealth of customization options, such as adjusting the sensitivity of the triggers or assigning macros to certain buttons. 8BitDo sells a few cheaper variants of this controller as well, but those sacrifice the Hall effect sticks, among other features. <em>\u2014 Jeff Dunn, Senior Commerce Writer</em></p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><h2>Grid Studio artwork</h2><p></p><p>If dad has a soft spot for classic gaming hardware, a <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2dyaWRzdHVkaW8uY2MvY29sbGVjdGlvbnMvZ2FtZS1jb25zb2xlIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiYjhiOWM3ZS04YTlkLTRmNzktOGYzNC1iZWYzODIwYzc3NTQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAXjgAGFTqycaAEFPhJ43NYpXvPs-Mm_SlCgwrSzgE8Mc&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fgridstudio.cc%2Fcollections%2Fgame-console\">frame from Grid Studio</a> might be a nice way to spruce up his space.

That's where the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N0b3JlLnN0ZWFtcG93ZXJlZC5jb20vc3RlYW1kZWNrIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiYjhiOWM3ZS04YTlkLTRmNzktOGYzNC1iZWYzODIwYzc3NTQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAeabTFzcJHpR5M6ul_0YjM6L5_zPeqMneCkdGNHgi1BQ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fsteamdeck\">Steam Deck</a> comes in handy. Valve's portable gaming system puts a ton of games into their hands, and it has enough power to play most indie titles and some AAA ones. Mostly, though, we found it to be a great way to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/valve-steam-deck-portable-pc-gaming-133008285.html\">clear out a PC gaming backlog</a> \u2014 perhaps as they\u2019re holding a little one who will only nap in their arms.</p><p>With the Steam Deck, they can carve out slices of gaming time when they have time to breathe. I've personally found it very useful in that wonderful period right after putting the kids down to sleep. They can play PC games in bed without moving a muscle! And if they already have a PC, they can also stream demanding games directly from it. While there are a few Steam Deck competitors on the horizon \u2013 we're particularly <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/asus-rog-ally-hands-on-possibly-the-most-powerful-handheld-gaming-pc-yet-140054506.html\">intrigued by the ASUS ROG Ally</a> \u2013 there's something to be said about the simplicity of Valve's experience. It's the most console-like way to enjoy PC games so far. (If handhelds aren't their thing, take a look at <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-console-140057674.html\">our gaming console guide too</a>!) <em>\u2014 Devindra Hardawar, Senior Reporter</em></p><h2><em>The Game Console 2.0: A Photographic History from Atari to Xbox</em></h2><p></p><p><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9HYW1lLUNvbnNvbGUtMi0wLVBob3RvZ3JhcGhpYy1IaXN0b3J5L2RwLzE3MTg1MDA2MDI_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMTFlLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiYjhiOWM3ZS04YTlkLTRmNzktOGYzNC1iZWYzODIwYzc3NTQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAd-QFe73ouPMaDFCA20P9zO8uDrGMPdXwNAxaUu70UUs&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGame-Console-2-0-Photographic-History%2Fdp%2F1718500602\"><em>The Game Console 2.0</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>is a good coffee-table book for any dad who enjoys looking back on gaming\u2019s history. It\u2019s a visual tour of more than 100 different consoles, from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnavox_Odyssey\">Magnavox Odyssey</a> to the PlayStation 5 to less-remembered fare like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapwave_Zodiac\">Tapwave Zodiac</a>. The author, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Amos\">Evan Amos</a>, is best known for taking many of the stock photos of gaming hardware you\u2019d find on Wikipedia (and beyond), so it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise to hear that the shots in his book are consistently clean and sharp. Each console has some light yet interesting background detail, and Amos neatly organizes the systems he documents by console generation. It\u2019s not the deepest dive into the industry\u2019s past, but it should be a pleasure for any gaming enthusiast to flip through every now and then. <em>\u2014 J.D.</em></p><h2>Game Pass Ultimate</h2><p></p><p>Microsoft's pitch with <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9YYm94LUdhbWUtUGFzcy1VbHRpbWF0ZS1NZW1iZXJzaGlwL2RwL0IwN1RHTkZWV1YvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTExZS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYmI4YjljN2UtOGE5ZC00Zjc5LThmMzQtYmVmMzgyMGM3NzU0In0&amp;signature=AQAAAfGiwkkwcOVX1uWU4Uh22mmUX-5GOK_9jR3z5y2Kf6XV&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FXbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership%2Fdp%2FB07TGNFVWV%2F\">Game Pass Ultimate</a> is hard to pass up. For $15 a month, you get access to a large library of Xbox and PC titles, including day-one releases from Microsoft studios. Now that new game prices have crept up to $70, Game Pass Ultimate seems like a better deal than ever. It's a useful way to dive into new and older games, and it's also helpful for keeping kids busy once they turn into little gamers. If they end up liking a particular title, there are discounts if dad wants to permanently add something to their library.</p><p>Game Pass Ultimate also unlocks Xbox cloud streaming, which I've found to be useful on the road (all you need is a laptop and an Xbox controller to get some playtime!). It's also helpful for previewing a game quickly, without waiting for it to be downloaded and installed. Progress is also stored on Microsoft's servers, so dad can also pick up and keep playing if they choose to download a cloud title eventually. <em>\u2014 D.H.</em></p><h2><em>Metroid Prime Remastered</em></h2><p></p><p>There are a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/best-games/\">million different games</a> worth gifting for Father\u2019s Day, but if dad never got around to playing <em>Metroid Prime</em> back in the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-gamecube-20th-anniversary-games-140054823.html\">GameCube days</a>, getting him the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9UZXN0LTMtTmludGVuZG8tU3dpdGNoL2RwL0IwOVlaTlJRN1M_dGg9MSZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby0xMWUtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImJiOGI5YzdlLThhOWQtNGY3OS04ZjM0LWJlZjM4MjBjNzc1NCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAbPFxPnrN5dOBftSxU70aymJS7IS3-E16HCjcgiWwF9O&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FTest-3-Nintendo-Switch%2Fdp%2FB09YZNRQ7S%3Fth%3D1\">recent Switch remaster</a> is a fantastic way to rectify that. This <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/metroid-prime-remastered-switch-230628691.html\">new version</a> sharpens up the original\u2019s already stunning art direction and includes a more modern dual-stick control scheme. The first-person adventure at the heart of it all remains one of the most entrancing games ever made. It channels the isolation and wonder of the series\u2019 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroid_(video_game)\">NES roots</a>, and manages to be thrilling even as it encourages you to slow down and take in the world\u2019s details. While it has its share of action, it\u2019s not a first-person shooter so much as a first-person exploration game. Some 20 years after <em>Prime</em>\u2019s initial release, few titles have made encountering an alien world through someone else\u2019s eyes feel more authentic. <em>\u2014 J.D.</em></p><h2>Scuf Instinct Pro</h2><p></p><p>There\u2019s no shortage of customizable gift ideas you\u2019ll find for Father\u2019s Day, but if your dad likes to spend time gaming, a custom pillow, frame or plaque may not be as useful as a customized controller. Scuf makes a number of controllers, and you can personalize almost every part of them, down to the color of the thumbsticks. The wireless Instinct Pro works with Xbox, PC, Mac and mobile OSes, and we like its remappable paddles and its adjustable instant triggers, which remove pull down and make it feel more like a mouse click. It\u2019s a more than capable controller that any gamer would love to receive, but the cherry on top will be customizing it with their favorite colors and hues. <em>\u2014 Valentina Palladino, Senior Commerce Editor</em></p><h2>SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless</h2><p></p><p>SteelSeeries' previous high-end gaming headphones, the Arctis Pro, were some of the best we've ever heard.

Satisfye sells grips for all three Switch models in various colors as well as bundles that pair the accessory with a specially designed case. <em>\u2014 J.D.</em></p><h2>Backbone One</h2><p></p><p>If dad likes to game on his phone, the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9CYWNrYm9uZS1pT1MtTW9iaWxlLUdhbWVwYWQtQ29udHJvbGxlci1DZXJ0aWZpZWQvZHAvQjA4Ukw3VkxLWT90aD0xJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTExZS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYmI4YjljN2UtOGE5ZC00Zjc5LThmMzQtYmVmMzgyMGM3NzU0In0&amp;signature=AQAAAVMteELeIMOn3CsjQxb4rYeK82ubgzNeQ3D9F1mjV4fo&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBackbone-iOS-Mobile-Gamepad-Controller-Certified%2Fdp%2FB08RL7VLKY%3Fth%3D1\">Backbone One</a> will give him a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/backbone-one-ios-gamepad-review-143015385.html\">more natural way</a> to play.

While there are certainly cheaper and more convenient ways to play old games, these 6.75-inch cabinets don\u2019t feel flimsy and generally convey the spirit of each game well. (Just note that the artwork is usually \u201cinspired by\u201d the game in question, not a replica of its original cabinet.) Their buttons are surprisingly responsive and, while the 2.75-inch screen looks washed out from an angle, it\u2019s bright and colorful enough to be usable.

A group of researchers from the University of Arizona's Sleep and Health Research Program, some of whom also serve as the company's medical advisors, have just published a paper in peer-reviewed journal <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frsle.2023.1156844/abstract\"><em>Frontiers in Sleep</em></a>. The paper details the results of a 12-week program that used Sleep Reset, which apparently increased the average participant's sleep time by 44 minutes.</p><p>Those who were getting less than six hours of sleep a night increased their sleep time by 85 minutes. Some of them likely improved their time because they were able to fall asleep much earlier: The paper says participants who typically lie awake for 30 minutes before dozing off managed to reduce that time by 53 percent. And those who usually spend an hour trying to fall asleep were able to reduce their time awake by 41 percent. Meanwhile, those'd wake up more than three times overnight found themselves experiencing two fewer nightly awakenings. The researchers also said that nearly half of the participants stopped using sleep aids after completing the program.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The study involved 564 participants (65 percent of whom were female) aged 30 to 60 years old who followed a standardized curriculum for three months. They used Sleep Reset in the way it's meant to be used in that its sleep coaches gave them personalized recommendations and feedback via text messages within the app. They also used the app's sleep diary, mindfulness exercises and trackers to monitor their progress. To use Sleep Reset, a user needs to answer a series of questions on what kind of sleep they're getting and what they're having trouble with. They're also asked to state what their goals are, such as whether they're looking to feel more well-rested or to look more youthful.</p><p>I tried the sleep assessment test and was told repeatedly throughout that Sleep Reset is effective because it \"uses the same scientifically proven methods that are used by top tier Sleep Clinics like Stanford and Mayo Clinic.\" It also said that Sleep Reset uses \"scientific strategies,\" such as techniques based on cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, and coaches users about behavioral scheduling, light exposure and relaxation. I only got so far as the page charging me for a seven-day trial period, which users could get for as little as $9 to as much as $29. The most expensive option, the company said, will help it support those who could only afford to pay the minimum amount.</p><p>That said, the participants' curriculum gives us a good look at how Sleep Reset can help support its users. Every week, they received different types of coaching tips. During week three, for instance, they got napping strategies and tips on caffeine intake, while they received information on how nutrition and physical movement affect sleep quality during week six. While there was a theme for each week, the participants presumably received information that's tailored for each of them.&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Michael Grandner, Associate Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Arizona College of Medicine and Sleep Reset's Lead Scientific advisor said: \"Many popular sleep solutions like Trazadone, Benadryl and Melatonin don't even have the clinical evidence to increase total sleep time much at all. Ambien and Lunesta are known to increase sleep time by around 30 minutes, but that's much less than what we've seen from Sleep Reset. What's even better is that Sleep Reset is a non-medication intervention, thus non-habit forming and devoid of troubling side effects.\"</p><p>You can watch Dr. Grandner talk about their study below:</p><div id=\"07146eb2d70841cd9a0ce019d55bb105\"><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/study-finds-sleep-coaching-app-can-help-recover-an-extra-hour-of-rest-130003393.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/study-finds-sleep-coaching-app-can-help-recover-an-extra-hour-of-rest-130003393.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-06 13:00:03+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Google brings its predictive smart compose feature to Chat", "description": "<p>Google's Slack-like business app <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-will-make-chat-app-free-2021-185953374.html\">Chat</a>, previously known as <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-hangouts-is-well-and-truly-dead-052557495.html\">Hangouts</a>, is getting an AI update on web, the company <a href=\"https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/06/smart-compose-google-chat.html\">announced</a>.

Instead, through external and internal sensors and cameras, you use the Vision Pro with voice input and hand/eye gestures. You can finger-pinch to select things and a use pinch-slide motion for scrolling up/down or left/right. Unlike the Oculus Quest series, you can even make those hand gestures comfortably on your lap; you don't have to hold your hands up dramatically like a <em>Minority Report</em> cosplayer. The most unusual twist might be EyeSight. Apple uses the curved display on the headset's exterior to display your eyes and reactions while you\u2019re wearing the device.</p><p>Apple's visionOS, made for this new kind of product, feels like a cross between iOS and macOS, powered by a new R1 chip and an M2 processor to deliver what Apple describes as responsive, &quot;lag-free&quot; standalone performance. Tapping the digital crown (yes, like the Apple Watch) brings up your app icons, while in some demos, rotating the crown blends the augmented reality vision into a more immersive one.

Dozens of subreddits, including major examples like Earthporn, LifeProTips, ReactionGIFs and Videos, have declared they're &quot;going dark&quot; (that is, going private) starting June 12th in response to an API pricing increase they believe will shut out third-party clients. Some will resume public access after 48 hours, but others will &quot;permanently&quot; isolate themselves until Reddit addresses their concerns.</p><p>Christian Selig, the creator of popular client Apollo, says the API pricing would cost him $20 million per year. The developers of other apps, such as Narwhal and Reddit is Fun, have also warned they can't afford the new prices and will likely shut down soon as a result. Moderators are concerned because third-party Reddit apps frequently include customizations and other features that help keep subreddits in check.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/reddit-communities-are-going-dark-to-protest-changes-that-would-hurt-third-party-apps-154133342.html\"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-morning-after-apple-reveals-its-mixed-reality-headset-the-vision-pro-111424711.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/the-morning-after-apple-reveals-its-mixed-reality-headset-the-vision-pro-111424711.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-06 11:14:24+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Amazon Fire Kids tablets are up to 50 percent off right now", "description": "<p>Amazon is having a <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAdxRVD3i0I_lcvUXT1JE5-vKbwOakAn2bx2ZL-4HbwyS&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdeal%2F7c6f7011%3Fpf_rd_r%3DZA0NZZC99M2G1EEQZRZ0%26pf_rd_t%3DEvents%26pf_rd_i%3Ddeals%26pf_rd_p%3D605d5925-0e4f-4a06-bd31-7d87dcf4a9c0%26pf_rd_s%3Dslot-14%26ref%3Ddlx_deals_gd_dcl_img_1_7c6f7011_dt_sl14_c0\">big sale on its Fire Kids tablets</a> just in time for summer break.

The board, which is made up of nearly two dozen experts in human rights and free speech, published its annual report covering its work and interactions with Meta over the last year.</p><p>While last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.oversightboard.com/news/322324590080612-oversight-board-publishes-first-annual-report/\"><ins>report </ins></a>sharply criticized Meta for not being transparent enough, the latest report highlights the impact the board\u2019s recommendations are starting to have on the company. \u201cIn 2022, it was encouraging to see that, for the first time, Meta made systemic changes to its rules and how they are enforced, including on user notifications and its rules on dangerous organizations,\u201d the board wrote in a statement.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The report also highlights areas where its members believe Meta can improve. According to the report, Meta reversed its initial moderation decision in almost two-thirds of cases they were picked for the Oversight Board\u2019s shortlist, which \u201craises wider questions both about the accuracy of Meta's content moderation and the appeals process.\u201d</p><p>The board also points out that it\u2019s been more than two years since it first recommended the company better align its policies between Instagram and Facebook, but that the company has \u201crepeatedly pushed back the deadline\u201d for doing so. The group also takes issue with Meta\u2019s refusal to translate internal guidelines for its content moderators into their native languages. Meta has contended that all its moderators are fluent in English so the step is unnecessary. But the board says \u201cEnglish-only guidance may cause reviewers to miss context and nuance across languages and dialects,\u201d which can cause errors in enforcement.</p><p>The report also describes a lack of transparency over some aspects of Meta\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/facebook-newsworthiness-politicians-oversight-board-171141109.html\"><ins>\u201cnewsworthiness\u201d </ins></a>exception, which allows for some rule-breaking posts to remain online if the company determines there is a \u201cpublic interest value\u201d in the content. The Oversight Board says there is still \u201clittle is known about the process it [Meta] uses to decide whether content is newsworthy\u201d and that the company\u2019s responses to questions about the policy side-stepped direct answers.</p><p>The board\u2019s report suggests there are other frustrating moments in its interactions with Meta. At one point, the board notes that it took eight months for its members to gain access to the company\u2019s analytics tool CrowdTangle. The board also notes that many of its decisions over the last year were published after the 90-day timeframe set out in its rules. The board cites a few reasons for these delays but says that in some cases delays were due to \u201cnegotiations with Meta about how much information, which was originally provided by the company on a confidential basis, we could include in our final decision\u201d that took \u201clonger than anticipated.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s also notable just how few cases the Oversight Board ends up weighing in on. In the report, the board says that in 2022 it published 12 decisions \u2014 a tiny fraction of the nearly 1.3 million requests it received from users hoping to overturn one of Meta\u2019s moderation decisions.

It regularly falls short of sales projections, and things aren't likely to change soon (apparently despite the arrival of new <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-names-nbcu-ad-exec-linda-yaccarino-new-twitter-ceo-155537363.html\">CEO Linda Yaccarino</a>), according to Twitter employees and documents seen by the <em>NYT</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Musk previously said that Twitter was on track to post $3 billion in 2023 revenue compared to $5.1 billion in 2021. Last March, he <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-reportedly-values-twitter-at-20-billion-200841233.html\">stated</a> Twitter was worth $20 billion, less than half the $44 billion <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-elon-musk-buyout-offer-decision-185307689.html\">he paid for it</a>.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>In a Twitter Space last week, Musk said \"half our advertising\" disappeared, blaming advertisers in Europe and North America who have put \"extreme pressure\" on the company. \"They are trying to drive Twitter bankrupt,\" he added.</p><p>However, Twitter's ad sales staff is worried that advertisers have been scared off by a rise in hate speech and pornography, along with a surfeit of ads for things like online gambling and marijuana products. Since Musk took over Twitter, he has taken actions like firing key sales executives and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-morning-after-elon-musk-reinstates-donald-trumps-twitter-account-121554256.html\">reinstating banned users</a>. That prompted ad agencies and brands including GM and Volkswagen to pause ad spending.&nbsp;</p><p>Other advertisers including Apple, Amazon and Disney have reportedly been spending less on advertising than last year, employees told the <em>NYT</em>. It cited an example of large banner ads used to promote things like events or new movies (that can cost up to $500,000 for 24 hours) going unsold. Six agencies said clients have limited ad spending on Twitter over inconsistent support, confusion over changes and the presence of misinformation and toxic content.</p><p>They're also concerned about Musk's tweets, like one that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2023/05/16/george-soros-elon-musk-adl/\">compared</a> billion George Soros \u2014 a frequent target of antisemites \u2014 to X-Men comic book villain Magneto.

When Linda Yaccarino was appointed CEO last month, Musk said that she'll \"focus primarily on business operations, while I focus on product design and new technology.\" She may also be able to help Twitter smooth over troubled relationships with advertisers and resolve issues around moderation for hate speech, pornography and more.&nbsp;</p><p>\"For a period, we weren\u2019t even sure who to get on the phone with to talk to,\" one media exec told the <em>NYT</em>. \"With Linda coming in, that could change that in a big way.\" At the same time, he acknowledged that it may be a \"tall order\" for Yaccarino to deal with the volatile environment Musk has created.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/twitters-ad-sales-have-reportedly-dropped-by-59-percent-since-last-year-092543851.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/twitters-ad-sales-have-reportedly-dropped-by-59-percent-since-last-year-092543851.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-06 09:25:43+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Microsoft will pay the FTC $20 million to settle charges over collecting children's data", "description": "<p>Microsoft will <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/06/ftc-will-require-microsoft-pay-20-million-over-charges-it-illegally-collected-personal-information\">have to pay $20 million</a> to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-pay-20-mln-settle-charges-it-collected-childrens-information-2023-06-05/\">settle charges</a> brought by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that the company violated the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). In the complaint filed by the DOJ on behalf of the FTC, the department accused the tech giant of collecting its underage <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/xbox-head-says-microsofts-mobile-game-store-could-arrive-next-year-180007168.html\">Xbox</a> users' information and retaining their data even without their parents' consent.

The FTC found that Microsoft only asked users under 13 to get their parents to complete their account creation after they had already provided their personal information. And apparently, from 2015 until 2020, Microsoft collected and retained data from underage users, even if their parents didn't complete the registration process. Under COPPA, online services and websites must obtain verifiable parental consent before using any personal information from children.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The FTC also explained that Microsoft combines a user's gamertag with a unique persistent identifier that it could share with third-party developers, even for accounts owned by underage users. In a <a href=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/06/05/xbox-ftc-settlement-reimagining-future-of-safety-xbox/\">blog post</a>, Dave McCarthy, the CVP Xbox Player Services, said Microsoft didn't intentionally keep child accounts that weren't completed by their parents. The company found a technical glitch that caused data retention during its investigation, he said, and its engineering team deleted affected children's data after fixing the issue. &quot;The data was never used, shared, or monetized,&quot; he added.</p><p>In addition to paying $20 million to settle the FTC's charges, Microsoft will also be required under the DOJ's proposed order to change its account creation process for underage users. The tech giant has already updated the process so that it asks somebody's date of birth first and, if needed, ask for parental consent before it requires users to key in any other identifiable information. It will also ask users under the age of 13 who created an account before May 2021 to have their parent reverify their account over the coming months.&nbsp;</p><p>The FTC requires Microsoft to establish a system that would delete all the personal information it collects from kids within two weeks if their parents don't complete their account creation, as well. Plus, it wants the company to notify video game publishers if the personal information shared is from a child, so that it can protected by COPPA. While Microsoft has already implemented changes to its sign-up process, the proposed order must still be approved by a federal court before it can go into effect.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-will-pay-the-ftc-20-million-to-settle-charges-over-collecting-childrens-data-074602067.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-will-pay-the-ftc-20-million-to-settle-charges-over-collecting-childrens-data-074602067.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-06 07:46:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Apple Vision Pro hands-on: A new milestone for mixed reality, but issues remain", "description": "<p>&quot;Wow, wow, wow. <em>Bellissimo</em>.&quot; That was the first thing I heard from one excited WWDC attendee as I waited to test Apple's Vision Pro mixed reality headset. That level is excitement is exactly what Apple is hoping for. Realistically, not everyone will be able to afford a $3,499 device. But if Apple can get mainstream consumers excited about the <em>idea</em> of spatial computing, then it'll be able to make a bigger splash when it inevitably unveils a more affordable follow-up.</p><p>After spending thirty minutes with the Vision Pro, my reaction is more tempered than that excitable attendee. It's undoubtedly the best mixed reality (VR/AR) experience I've had yet, delivering an unparalleled sense of immersion, displays sharp enough to read text on websites, and an intuitive gesture-based user interface. And yet... it's still ultimately a VR headset, with many of the issues endemic to the entire category.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"f1afa728903648d7816a996c1402cdbf\"><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>But let's start at the beginning: Before I was anywhere near the Vision Pro, I had to jump through a few setup hoops on an iPhone. First I rotated my head around to map my face, then I gave the phone a full view of my ears for it to personalize the headset's spatial audio. I hopped into another room, took off my glasses, and an Apple representative used a machine to detect my prescription. The Vision Pro can't be used with glasses, so anyone who needs vision correction will have to order additional lenses.</p><p>After a few minutes of admiring Apple's meticulously designed corporate campus, I entered a room to see the Vision Pro in action. It looked even more impressive than when I first caught a glimpse of it in the morning, but that's probably because I didn't have to fight off desperate Apple media at the same time. I slipped it on like any other VR headset: I held the front lenses in my left hand, pulled the rear headstrap back a bit, and gently guided the device over my head.</p><p>The Vision Pro's stretchy rear headband felt better on my noggin than any of Meta's VR devices, but the headset still placed a bit of pressure against my eyes and around my nose once I securely tightened it with a rear dial. The prototype unit also had a velcro strap going over my head, just like the Meta Quest. That's not visible on any of Apple's promotional materials, but the company tells me that the headset's modular design supports additional straps if necessary.</p><p>Even without the overhead strap, though, I'd wager the Vision Pro would still feel noticeable against your eyes. You probably won't forgot you're wearing it, which would ultimately cut into its sense of immersion.</p><p>But I'll admit, I mostly forgot about that slight discomfort once I saw the Vision Pro in action. When the screen lit up, I was confronted with the same posh meeting room I initially entered, except this time I could also see an array of app icons hovering in front of me. Thanks to the headset's high-resolution front cameras, I had a clear view of my surroundings, along with the Apple representatives guiding my demo. It wasn't a perfect representation of reality, but it was better than any VR or AR product I've seen yet.</p><p>After a bit of eye tracking training, which involved following dots moving around the screen with just my eyes, it also felt like I gained a superpower. A mere glance at an app icon, or a specific menu or button, would instantly highlight it. Then I learned two key gestures, a finger pinch for selecting things, and a pinch-slide motion for scrolling up/down, or left/right. Unlike the Quest, you can also make those hand gestures comfortable on your lap, you don't have to hold your hands up like an amateur symphony conductor.</p><div id=\"85df679b43674f619c833e993fbbc283\"><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>It may be a cliche to say this, but after just a few seconds of learning those gestures, I felt like Tom Cruise in <em>Minority Report</em>. A glance and a pinch is all it took for me to open up apps and breeze through the interface. I also figured out a flick and pinch motion could quickly scroll through websites, a genuinely intuitive gesture that simply felt delightful. After years of living with touchscreen interfaces on iOS and iPadOS, I don't think anyone is going to have trouble learning how to use the Vision Pro.</p><p>With the basics down, I was ready to experience the Vision Pro's most wondrous bits of hardware: Its dual 4K micro-OLED displays. They look sharper than any screen I've seen before, be it a VR headset or a TV. Photos look incredibly crisp, <em>especially</em> panoramic pictures, which completely fill your entire field of vision. And 3D videos shot with the Vision Pro's front cameras look eerily lifelike \u2014 almost as if you were replaying a perfectly captured memory.</p><p>I was most impressed with how the Vision Pro handled a 3D clip of <em>Avatar: The Way of Water</em>. The movie looked crisp and clear with all of the 3D depth I remembered from the theater. At times, the 3D looked even better than in cinemas, since I didn't have to reduce the brightness of the film with shaded 3D glasses. Apple wouldn't confirm if the Vision Pro could play <em>The Way of Water</em> in in a 48fps high frame rate \u2014 the film initially swapped between 24fps and 48fps footage in theaters \u2014 but even without that capability, it's something I'd still prefer to watch on headset instead of a 2D 4K TV.</p><figure><img alt=\"Apple visionOS home screen\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/c4a4e920-042f-11ee-bfeb-dfae74f91ff7\" style=\"height: 1281px; width: 1920px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Apple</div></figure><p>Like other VR headsets, you can also hop into a virtual cinema to watch videos. By default, that mode puts you in the middle of a theater, but as a dedicated front row sitter, it wasn't nearly close enough for me. (Fight me, I don't care.) Thankfully, the Vision Pro gives you options: I was able to virtually move much closer to the screen, while back row weirdos can also create that experience. Seeing <em>Avatar: The Way of Water</em> projected in clear 3D, at a size close to my local multiplex, felt miraculous. Just imagine slipping this thing on during a long flight and having a movie marathon.</p><p>The Vision Pro's side speakers also do a great job of recreating cinematic spatial sound. Since they're basically just tiny speakers, though, other people can also hear them. For a truly private experience, you'll have to slip in a pair of AirPods or AirPods Max.</p><section><img alt=\"Apple Vision Pro\" class=\"e2ehero-url\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/daa02e80-03ec-11ee-bff2-fb832b51186e\" style=\"height: 1187px; width: 2000px;\" /></section><p>While I'm mainly dreaming of the private cinema possibilities of the Vision Pro, Apple is positioning it as a next-generation computing platform. You can launch many of the company's native apps from its home screen, including Safari, the aforementioned Photos, and Messages. Keeping the dream of <em>Minority Report </em>alive, you can also drag windows to specific spots in your room. As you open new windows, apps also reposition themselves to make room, as you'd expect.</p><p>Apple's visionOS, which powers the headset, feels like a cross between iOS and macOS. Apple fans will be right at home. Tapping the Digital Crown on the upper right side of the headset brings you to the home screen, which is organized into Apps, People and Environments. The latter includes 3D captures of scenic spaces, like Oregon's Mount Hood.</p><p>When I loaded that space, I found myself sitting in front of a peaceful lake, but I could still see the Apple meeting room around the edges of my vision. As I rotated the Digital Crown, the 3D environment completely overtook what I was seeing, transforming into a fully VR experience. That seamlessness was astonishing \u2014 it's even better than <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/magic-leap-2-ar-headset-tech-dive-143046676.html\">a similar feature I saw on the Magic Leap 2</a>.</p><p>I was similarly impressed with a glimpse at Apple's new video format, Apple Immersive Video, which delivers razor-sharp 180-degree videos in 3D. While 360-degree VR videos are nothing new, even the best of them look fuzzier than real life. Apple's tech, which relies on 8K footage from a new camera developed by the company, looks startlingly real. It captured the wonder of flying through the air, as well as the thrilling moment of a well-placed soccer goal. If Apple's spatial vision tech gains some traction, I'm sure plenty of sports fans would be eager to have a field-level view of the action. Notably, the footage still managed to feel immersive, even though it didn't fully wrap me in 360-degrees of video.</p><div id=\"5c0db58607a941109766a1b16a184536\"><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>A Mindfullness app demo also showed off how effortlessly the Vision Pro can take over your reality. As I worked through a calm breathing exercise for a minute, my field of vision was slowly filled with a virtual flower, which blocked out my view of the meeting room.&nbsp;</p><p>As impressed as I was by much of the Vision Pro, it's clear that Apple's mixed reality universe isn't fully baked. While it was fascinating to have a FaceTime chat with another Apple representative wearing her own headset, I found the computer-generated &quot;Persona&quot; avatar to be strangely off-putting. It looked human, but it was stiff and robotic, the uncanniest of valleys. If you were to FaceTime your parent, I'd bet they'd rather see your actual face, with all of its imperfections, instead of a cold CG simulacrum.</p><p>I thought back to that 3D video that initially wowed me: It showed a child blowing out their birthday candles and having fun with their siblings. But to take that video, a parent had to be wearing the Vision Pro headset, effectively separating themselves from fully experiencing that moment. Is a moment captured in time worth not being present for the actual moment? (It also brings to mind another scene from <em>Minority Report, </em>where a broken Tom Cruise finds a brief moment of solace by watching a hologram of his missing son.)  Perhaps the Vision Pro could be placed on a stand to shoot 3D video, but that doesn't fully solve the odd inhumanity of Apple's initial pitch.</p><div id=\"67ba6d4a254a4bc8b3ca6b7fef85305f\"><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>I ended my Vision Pro demo with an encounter with a dinosaur. When I launched the experience, the far wall of my meeting room transformed into an enormous prehistoric portal. I could see small reptiles crawling around the grown, and in the distance, I could hear an enormous dinosaur approaching. After asking if I was comfortable with being up close with a dino, the Apple reps suggested that I get up out of my seat and walk towards the wall. The dinosaur approached end eventually walked through the portal and partially entered the meeting room. It sniffed my hand when I held it out. Its scales looked impossibly real.&nbsp;</p><p>But, like so many VR experiences, it was a completely solitary endeavor. Maybe someone could have joined me if they had their own Vision Pro headset nearby, but how many people will actually buy this $3,499 device? Apple is positioning the headset as an alternative to an expensive home theater, but that's also something you can enjoy with other people. I'm pretty sure my wife would rather see <em>Avatar: The Way of Water</em> in 2D on our TV, instead of just hearing me wax about how great it looks in the Vision Pro. (More than one Apple representative suggested that problem could eventually be solved by buying multiple headsets. I laughed.)</p><p>Apple is still straddling the line between immersion and isolation with the Vision Pro. Some features, like EyeSight, which projects your eyes onto an OLED screen on the front of the device, can connect the headset's users with others nearby. I also thought the ability to see your hands in mixed reality, as well as to see others when they got close, was all pretty thoughtful. But those hands you see aren't real. The eyes on the headset are just a replication of your own. They're efforts to solve some of the more annoying issues with VR, but they aren't complete fixes.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps I'd be more enamored with the Vision Pro as a computing platform if I saw more of its capabilities. I couldn't try out the virtual keyboard, or its integration with Bluetooth keyboards, trackpads and mice. I couldn't see what it was like to project my MacBook's screen into a virtual display \u2014 <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-wwdc-2023-mixed-reality-headset-analysis-180015769.html\">something I predicted we'd see last week</a>.</p><p>At the very least, Apple has succeeded in crafting the most impressive pitch for spatial computing yet. It's not just about games or forcing people to care about the metaverse. The Vision Pro wants to bring the things you already do on your computers into mixed reality. Perhaps this will lead to cheaper and more consumer-friendly headsets down the line. Maybe it sets Apple up for a hologram-filled future, where you don't even need to wear glasses to see digital elements. So much is uncertain. But for Apple, jumping into spatial computing could be worth the risk.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Apple's WWDC 2023 </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/wwdc-2023/\"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apple-vision-pro-hands-on-a-new-milestone-for-mixed-reality-060943291.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/apple-vision-pro-hands-on-a-new-milestone-for-mixed-reality-060943291.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-06 06:09:43+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
