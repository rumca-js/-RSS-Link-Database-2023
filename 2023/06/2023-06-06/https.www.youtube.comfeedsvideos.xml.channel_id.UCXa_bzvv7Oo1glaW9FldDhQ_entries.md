It's official: Metal Gear Solid 3 is getting a remake, which Konami calls Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, for Xbox Series X/S, PS5 and PC. The gameplay is being "evolved," but the story isn't changing. Even the voice acting is from the original release with no re-recording.

However, for many fans, it's almost unbelievable that a remake is happening. Metal Gear is one of Konami's biggest franchises, but it's been on the backburner following creator Hideo Kojima's departure and the awful Metal Gear Survive.

Thus, one has to ask: Is Konami suddenly the good guy? Does it deserve a second chance, especially with other highly-anticipated announcements and core gaming moves this year? It's a tough question, especially given its troubling history.
