If you're interested in communing with wildlife to unleash devastating destruction to hordes of nightmarish abominations, here's how to construct a confidently competent and wildly satisfying end-game Druid companion build in Diablo 4.

From the creator of Final Destination, a runaway bride must fight for survival against her vengeful former fiancé and his seven deadly groomsmen.

Til Death Do Us Part is a fresh and frightening, genre-bending ride led by Cam Gigandet (Twilight, Never Backdown), Jason Patric (The Lost Boys, Speed 2: Cruise Control), Natalie Burn (Black Adam, The Enforcer) and Orlando Jones (The Time Machine, Drumline).

Directed by Emmy Award Winner Timothy Woodward Jr., Til Death Do Us Part portrays the grim reality that not every romance story ends with happily ever after.  After running away on her wedding day, a bride-to-be must fight for survival against her former fiancé and his seven deadly groomsmen. In the ultimate horror showdown, the groomsmen soon discover that she has no intention of going back to the life she left behind.

Brimming with stylish violence and blood-soaked action, Til Death Do Us Part seamlessly blends the slick, kinetic thrills of John Wick with the dark, twisted revenge tale of Kill Bill.

Co-written by Chad Law (Black Water) and Shane Dax Taylor (Isolation), Til Death Do Us Part also stars Ser'Darius Blain (Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle), D.Y. Sao (Everything Everywhere All at Once), Neb Chupin (Mindcage, Acceleration) and Pancho Moler (3 from Hell). The film is produced by Jeffrey Reddick (Final Destination), Woodward Jr./Status Media and Entertainment and Burn/Born To Burn Films. Reddick and Woodward Jr. previously collaborated on the popular horror films The Final Wish & The Call, both starring genre legend Lin Shaye. The film’s Executive Producers include Matthew Helderman and Luke Taylor, with Thomas Mann and Neb Chupin acting as Co-Executive Producers.

Til Death Do Us Part will release exclusively in theaters nationwide on August 4.

If you know one thing about Final Fantasy 7, it’s that Aerith dies. There’s a reason why this pivotal story beat is one of the most well-known spoilers in gaming: it’s a moment that’s continually stunned players since 1997. 

Over 25 years, rumour became myth, myth became hoax, and eventually hope became a way to genuinely save the flower girl from Midgar. This is the inside story of the players who rewrote fate and resurrected Aerith Gainsborough.

We speak to YouTuber Oddheader about his Aerith revival easter egg video, several Aerith cosplayers and fanatics, and modder Sega Chief about his incredible Final Fantasy 7 mod, New Threat that lets you keep Aerith alive.

There’s been unconfirmed reports circulating online that there’s already a #TMNT #MutantMayhem animated series in the works for Paramount Plus, set to take place after the events of Mutant Mayhem.

Star Wars Jedi: Survivor has plenty of action-packed moments and great gameplay sequences, but Cal and Merrin’s breathtaking showdown with the Trident-class assault ship on Jedha puts them all to shame. Amazingly, this sequence didn’t seem like a sure thing until fairly late in development. Respawn Entertainment’s Stig Asmussen, Jedi: Survivor’s director, discusses how this stunning setpiece came to life.
