Through the tinted windows placed just behind the bowler\u2019s arm at the Vauxhall End was the perfect view of him, ball after ball: setting up outside leg stump, stepping across, nudging off his pads for a run on his way to 121.<br /><br />For British scribes who covered their last home Ashes in 2019, it was simply Smith picking up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/13/steve-smith-england-australia-ashes\">where he left off.</a> They saw Smith do exactly that to the tune of 774 runs last time around, and any time your tally equals an ABC radio callsign you\u2019re doing well. They can\u2019t believe that Smith between that series and now returned to the realm of batting mortals. They can look at the numbers \u2013 28 Tests, four centuries \u2013 but they can\u2019t quite believe what they weren\u2019t there to see.</p><p>It was striking how much Smith\u2019s hundred at the Oval resembled those from his last visit to England. There was the same bloodymindedness, a fully embodied determination that he was not going to accept anything less from his time in the middle. There was that scoring strike rate that spent most of the first day in the 30s before finally nudging up to 41. There were the 19 boundaries, only half a dozen of which went through the off-side between mid-off and point. Above all, there was a return to the technique that worked so well last time.<br /><br />During the interim, Smith had changed up, taking guard more centrally in front of the stumps and staying more still at the crease while waiting for the bowler to arrive. It worked for him in Sri Lanka in 2022, with his unbeaten 145 in Galle. That innings felt significant. For a six-year span between 2013 and 2019, he made 26 hundreds. After Manchester 2019, it was one century in nearly three years, a pandemic notwithstanding. Then came Galle, and soon afterwards a century against South Africa and a double against West Indies.<br /><br />For those last three Smith used the new technique, where he tried to stay more side-on to the ball and not to move. Part of his explanation was that it kept his body to the leg-side of the ball, opening up the off-side so he could score more aggressively through cover. Especially against the generally faster pace of South Africa, that helped his scoring options. And with less movement off the surface in Australia, it was a safe method as well.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/08/cricket-england-australia-ashes-steve-smith-batting-immortal\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/08/cricket-england-australia-ashes-steve-smith-batting-immortal", "date_published": "2023-06-08 17:52:03+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "\u2018It\u2019s unbelievable\u2019: Annecy shocked by knife attack on young children in park", "description": "<p>Four very young children and two adults were stabbed in a lakeside playground in the French Alps city</p><p></p><p>It was a sunny mid-morning at the edge of one of France\u2019s most beautiful lakes, framed by mountains and park lawns in the picturesque French Alps city of Annecy.</p><p>The quiet, waterside playground, with a slide and climbing frame, was a favourite for local toddlers with their parents and childminders as well as tourists.

Finding a complement for these elusive, drastically compressed pieces is tricky \u2013 alongside them, the string quartets by his teacher Schoenberg, for instance, seem positively indulgent and overblown.

The Richter Ensemble opt to play 16 movements, varying the instrumentation for some of them by adding a violone and a harpsichord to the basic string quartet, who play on gut strings at baroque pitch, and interleaving them in groups between the Webern works, which are included chronologically. Their sequence ends with Bach\u2019s final number, Contrapunctus XIV, which may have been intended as a quadruple fugue but which remained unfinished at his death; they present it exactly as Bach left it, breaking off mid-phrase.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/08/webern-string-quartets-bach-the-art-of-fugue-review-passacaille\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/08/webern-string-quartets-bach-the-art-of-fugue-review-passacaille", "date_published": "2023-06-08 14:30:33+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "Chris Christie says he\u2019s anti-Trump \u2013 but did he secure a presidential pardon for a crony?", "description": "<p>Ethics expert says ex-New Jersey governor must answer questions over George Gilmore, pardoned on Trump\u2019s last day in office </p><p>A leading US ethics expert said the former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who this week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2023/jun/07/chris-christie-launches-2024-presidential-run-and-calls-out-voldemort-trump-video\">launched</a> a presidential campaign aimed at taking down Donald Trump, owes the American public an explanation of why and how he secured a pardon for a powerful New Jersey Republican, issued on Trump\u2019s last day in the White House.</p><p>\u201cWe just don\u2019t know the answer to that,\u201d Noah Bookbinder, president of <a href=\"https://www.citizensforethics.org/\">Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington</a> (Crew), said. \u201cAnd I think we should.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/08/chris-christie-anti-trump-candidate\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/08/chris-christie-anti-trump-candidate", "date_published": "2023-06-08 12:00:32+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "People with sleep problems at greater risk of stroke, study suggests", "description": "<p>Scientists find people with symptoms of insomnia have 16% increased risk of developing condition</p><p>Scientists in the US have found people with one or more self-reported symptoms of insomnia have a 16% increased risk of developing the serious medical condition, compared with those without symptoms.</p><p>They said the link was stronger in participants under 50, where those with five to eight symptoms had nearly four times the risk of having a stroke.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/08/people-with-sleep-problems-insomnia-at-greater-risk-of-stroke-study-suggests\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/08/people-with-sleep-problems-insomnia-at-greater-risk-of-stroke-study-suggests", "date_published": "2023-06-08 11:25:19+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "The CNN chief messed up in many ways.

Explaining her decision to stand down, she says:</p><p>The intensity of these constituency commitments, together with the particular responsibilities of being my party\u2019s sole MP, mean that, ironically, I\u2019ve not been able to focus as much as I would like on the existential challenges that drive me \u2013 the nature and climate emergencies. I have always been a different kind of politician \u2013 as those who witnessed my arrest, court case and acquittal over peaceful protest at the fracking site in Balcombe nearly ten years ago will recall. And the truth is, as these threats to our precious planet become ever more urgent, I have struggled to spend the time I want on these accelerating crises. I have therefore decided not to stand again as your MP at the next election.</p><p>The reason I came into politics was to change things. Thirteen years ago it\u2019s inconceivable that parliament would have declared a climate emergency. And I\u2019ve put issues like a universal basic income and a legal right to access nature on the political agenda; secured the first parliamentary debate in a generation on drug law reform; and thanks to my work in parliament, a natural history GCSE will soon be on the syllabus.

Anyone who has ever produced anything at all will die at the accuracy of this scene and identify with Beth\u2019s instinct to throw up in the nearest bin. The movie asks if the husband has been right to conceal his true feelings, and if she is right to react as she does.</p><p>The cleverness of the set-up is in how endlessly applicable it is and how disproportionate the feelings are that these kinds of incidents trigger. Most of us have been on both sides of this equation, struggling to find the right answer when a partner asks: \u201cHow do I look in this?\u201d, and also trying to temper our own neediness when asking (pleading) for similar reassurances.
