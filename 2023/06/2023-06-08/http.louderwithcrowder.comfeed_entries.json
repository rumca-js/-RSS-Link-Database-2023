Keep that Shakespeare quote in your mind. I'm going to get back to it.</p><p>The internet tells me Mike Pence took part in a CNN Town Hall for his presidential campaign. The internet also tells me Mike Pence is running for president. That should tell you how much of an impact the former vice president has made. He had a comment during the town hall that Joe Biden is not giving Ukraine money fast enough. Yes, that Joe Biden and that Ukraine.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">Mike Pence complains that Joe Biden has been slow in providing Ukraine with military equipment. <a href=\"https://t.co/pR0BtcAWWK\">pic.twitter.com/pR0BtcAWWK</a><br />\u2014 The Post Millennial (@TPostMillennial) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TPostMillennial/status/1666646237754404865?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 8, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Set aside that Nikki Haley has already laid claim to the \"we should be giving Ukraine MOAR money\" wing of the GOP.

Either Ron DeSantis or Donald Trump is going to be the nominee. I get the roles Haley, Chris Christie, Tim Scott, and Vivek Ramaswamy are playing. Some are running a longshot campaign. Others are auditioning for a cabinet role in the new administration. There's been insinuation that some of them have struck deals with the big two (Haley/Vivek with Trump, Christie with DeSantis) to play attack dog. It's a time-honored process. The GOP primary is both a performance as well as a process. I understand how it works.</p><p>Mike Pence, why are you here?</p><p>It's not your personality.</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cYour social media team needs to be blacklisted.\\u201d</div> \u2014 Brodigan (@Brodigan)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brodigan/status/1658896597818679296\">1684346744</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These bars when out of style when Tea Party grifters were fleecing grandparents out of their money to SAVE THE CONSTITUTION.</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cI\\u2019m a Christian, a Conservative, and a Republican in that order! #Pence2024\\u201d</div> \u2014 Mike Pence (@Mike Pence)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Mike_Pence/status/1666564942504263682\">1686175020</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In Pence's head, what exact role does he think he is playing?

He proposed a 28th Amendment today to instill leftist gun control in the United States Constitution. But NOT overturn the 2nd Amendment. Newsom says this won't encroach on that amendment at all.</p><p>Here, let him explain:</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cNEW: I\\u2019m proposing the 28th Amendment to the United States Constitution to help end our nation\\u2019s gun violence crisis.\\n\\nThe American people are sick of Congress\\u2019 inaction.\\n\\nThe 28th will enshrine 4 widely supported gun safety freedoms -- while leaving the 2nd Amendment intact:\\n\\n1)\\u2026\\u201d</div> \u2014 Gavin Newsom (@Gavin Newsom)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GavinNewsom/status/1666784034406666241\">1686227255</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>I\u2019m proposing the 28th Amendment to the United States Constitution to do just that. The 28th Amendment will enshrine in the Constitution commonsense gun safety measures that Democrats, Republicans, Independents, and gun owners overwhelmingly support \u2013 while leaving the Second Amendment unchanged and respecting America\u2019s gun-owning tradition.</blockquote><p>His amendment would do four things:</p><ol><li>Raise the age to purchase a gun to 21 (at minimum)</li><li>Universal background checks </li><li>A \"reasonable\" waiting period for gun purchases </li><li>Banning the civilian purchase of \"assault weapons\"</li></ol><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"830ab\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=34002863&amp;width=980\" />\n</p>\n<p>At this point, I can trust LwC fans understand all the policy reasons why this is insane. The words \"assault weapons\" alone don't mean anything other than what Democrats want them to mean at any given moment. Like when <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-guns-glock\" target=\"_blank\">Joe Biden includes most handguns</a>, even though <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/politifact-joe-biden-guns\" target=\"_blank\">Politifact claims Joe Biden saying that is not what we heard</a>.</p><p>What I find interesting is the political. It's clear Gavin Newsom is making a calculation that Joe Biden won't make it to the 2024 ballot, and he wants to be the alternative. He has also put all his chips in on Ron DeSantis being the Republican nominee. It's why he has been <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-gavin-newsom-california\" target=\"_blank\">trying and failing to attack DeSantis since last year</a>.</p><p>This move is Newsom's \"entry\" into the Democrat primary. And you know something? Go get 'em, Skippy. I love this idea. If nothing else, at least a Democrat is being honest about gun control for a change. Instead of arguing that the Constitution says things that it doesn't say, he is using the mechanism our founding fathers left for us to use.</p><p>I think this is a brilliant idea and Democrats should spare no expense and no amount of resources to convince thirty-eight out of the fifty states to support a constitutional amendment that would TAKE AWAY some of their rights. </p><p>Only today's Democrat party has the balls to do this. The time is now. It's the right side of history. If not now then...you know, the thing.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

Conservatives said, \"hey, this seems inappropriate.\"</p><p>The left doubled down with \"<a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mashable-ten-year-old-drag-queen\" target=\"_self\">Drag Queen Story Time</a>.\" Conservatives said, \"guys, seriously, you're crossing a line here. Let's leave children alone because this is wrong.\"</p><p>Now if you DON'T support all drag queens all the time, you hate every single one of the Ls, Gs, Bs, especially the Ts, Qs, As, Is, other Is, Ps, and whatever the hell the +s are.</p><p><span></span>So it became a thing...out of spite?</p><h3>T*tty weight lifting, though?</h3><br /><p>\n\tTo be fair, while the \"Illegal Drag Show: Be Gay, Do Crime\" at Oregon State University was advertised for all ages, they did note the show would contain \"adult themes.\" An argument could be made is should have been exclusive for adults in that case, but it's 2023.\n</p><p>\n\n</p><p>\n\tA source tells Campus Reform that at least four small children were present during the entire show. Two were so small, adults had to sit them on their laps so they could see. </p><blockquote>Footage also shows one of the drag queens leading a child on stage to be interviewed in front of the cheering audience. As the performer interviews, the child responds to a question with, \"He's a full grown man.\"</blockquote><p>However the t*tty weight lifting? That was a biological woman. </p><blockquote>One performer\u2014who appears to be a biological woman\u2014fully exposes her breasts for the audience by stripping off all upper body clothing. The performer then tries to hold various objects under them, such as a wooden sword and \"five pound\" weights. Footage shows the individual eventually bringing out a ladder, as a \"trans-masc\" associate joins her to assist with the \"titty weight lifting\" feat.</blockquote><p>If the artist was a biological woman -- really, who can tell these days -- that means instead of being a beautiful and brave drag queen living out loud with their best life, she was just a stripper? </p><p>In fairness to the drag queens and the one stripper, they may have assumed making the explicit sexual themes clear before the show would have meant no children in attendance. And that, even though it was \"all ages,\"  parents would know better.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"34868\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33997362&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>When the left and the media (I repeat myself) lie about conservatives wanting to outlaw drag shows, we aren't talking about the brunches and bingo nights suburban housewives go to in bars. I get the appeal of raunchy comedy and rated R movies. If you are an adult, do your adult things.</p><p>It's events like this, infront of and promoted to children. And then being told by the media and the left we have to be okay with it.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.
