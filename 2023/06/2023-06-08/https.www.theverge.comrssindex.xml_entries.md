  <p id="ZFBN2h">Devolver Digital shared details and trailers about some projects in development during its latest showcase on Thursday. However, much of the presentation revolved around a tongue-in-cheek mascot, “Volvy,” a fictionalized history of the mascot’s impact on gaming culture, and the “return” of the character as a robot (VOLV-E). It was weird, but that’s kind of Devolver’s thing for its presentations.</p>
<p id="R5fDVn">You can watch the whole 22-minute show <a href="https://youtu.be/o2ztnnc1_AE">right here</a> or catch up on the four featured games below (well, in addition to everything involving Volvy):</p>

  <p id="kkmxxn">It looks like Epic Games is doing a little rewilding on the <em>Fortnite</em> island. Ahead of the battle royale game’s next season  — Chapter 4: Season 3, if you’re counting — the developer gave a brief taste of what to expect through a trailer that debuted at Summer Game Fest. The new season is called “Wilds,” and it introduces a new jungle biome to the map. The change shouldn’t be too much of a surprise; Epic has been <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1666082948679090179">teasing the wild theme over the past week</a>. Oh, also, Optimus Prime is in the game now.</p>

During Summer Game Fest, game director Bryan Intihar made an appearance to share the last bit of the game we haven’t seen — a release date. On October 20th players can suit up as Miles and Peter to take down Kraven the Hunter and Venom in <em>Spider-Man 2</em>.</p>
<p id="7Ra6zQ">Also during the presentation, Intihar shared a bit more about one of the game’s villains, Kraven the Hunter. Intihar said that Kraven was unlike any character they’ve ever featured because he’s not superpowered or uses magic; he’s simply the best at what he does. Kraven’s coming to New York for his “greatest hunt,” with Intihar alluding that it’s not only Peter or Miles...</p>

  <p id="lbmFoJ">Horror legend nerd John Carpenter is helping make a new game called <em>John Carpenter’s Toxic Commando</em>. Based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqY8YoOkmIo">a brief trailer</a>, it looks like you’ll be taking on hordes of zombies in a first-person shooter — fortunately, there were a lot of cars featured in the trailer that were used to fend off the enemies.</p>
<p id="lBut7m">Carpenter is known for his work on some iconic horror franchises, including <em>Halloween </em>and <em>The Thing. </em>But he’s also a big gaming nerd — in <a href="https://www.avclub.com/john-carpenter-video-games-interview-halloween-ends-1849641145">a recent interview with <em>AV Club</em></a>, he said that he’s “addicted” to <em>Fallout 76, </em>“loved” <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em>, and thought that <em>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla</em> was “pretty damn good.” Hopefully he takes the best of what he loves from his favorite games and infuses that into <em>Toxic Commando</em>.</p>

<p id="jVkZix"><em>Sonic Superstars</em>’ trailer came as a true and wonderful surprise. We’re greeted with 2D, 16-bit Sonic running through Green Hills before passing a barrier transforming him into 3D. <em>Sonic Superstars</em> will let you play as Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and (!!!!)

<p id="aLVNH6">The bill, HB61, would ban “interactive computer services” from allowing people under 18 to sign up for their own accounts without parental consent. The bill’s definition of online services is extremely broad, seemingly barring minors from creating social media accounts on sites like Instagram, accessing popular online games like <em>Roblox</em> and <em>Fortnite</em>, or even registering for an email address. The bill also goes as far as allowing parents to cancel the terms of service contracts their children entered into when signing up for existing accounts. </p>

<p id="B1VdJR">It’s common to see 90 to 120Hz screens on tech from smartphones to PC gaming monitors, as it provides quicker responsiveness and smoother motion than slower displays. Apple has generally used 60Hz displays on everything it makes other than some of its “pro” devices like the iPad Pro and MacBook Pro that have 120Hz ProMotion displays. For a screen directly in front of your eyes, that added speed will make a big difference.</p>

  <p id="qE33q3">Oura is adding a new community feature to its smart sleep tracking ring. Starting today, you’ll now be able to create or join “Circles,” which are private groups where you can share readiness, sleep, and activity scores from the past two weeks. The company is also finally moving its new sleep staging algorithm out of beta for both iOS and Android users — though you may or may not like what it has to tell you.</p>
<p id="9FBx3b">Any user can create an Oura Circle and invite others to join via a shared link, provided the person you’re inviting is <em>also</em> an Oura member. When creating or joining a Circle, you can also customize what data gets shared. For example, if you’d rather that Judgy John from Accounting didn’t see your activity score, you don’t have to...</p>

  <p id="X05fXW">Ever since I learned how to write, I’ve never been without a journal. There are currently six I use regularly on my desk, plus the <a href="https://dayoneapp.com/">Day One</a> and <a href="https://daylio.net/">Daylio</a> apps on my phone. Each has its purpose, but I often wish for a single app or notebook to replace the rest. On paper, I’m the type of person Apple was appealing to when it announced the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/5/23738869/apple-journal-app-ios-iphone-wwdc-2023">Journal app</a> during this year’s WWDC keynote.  </p>
<p id="x8coYM">Instead, my reaction while watching the keynote was a knee-jerk Hell to the No. My hands were sweaty, my heart was racing, and I ended up walking away from my desk to take five deep breaths. The fact that Apple is Sherlocking Day One isn’t what set me off. It was the fact that Apple said it’ll use “on-device machine learning” to create customized journaling...</p>

Fauci has become a hated figure in right-wing politics, particularly among the anti-vax movement, and the attack ad seeks to grow this base of support for DeSantis by portraying Trump and Fauci as close collaborators. </p>

  <p id="JI5hWg">Summer Game Fest 2023 is nearly here. Geoff Keighley’s major summer gaming event takes place on Thursday, and this year, it might have some special significance. With <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/30/23660456/e3-2023-canceled">E3 canceled</a>, gaming companies wanting to show off their latest projects may turn to Summer Game Fest instead, which hopefully means that we’ll see some major news from the show.</p>
<p id="ddQPqt">There are already a few notable things to look forward to. CD Projekt Red has already said that <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>’s upcoming expansion starring Idris Elba, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/8/23501090/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-idris-elba-solomon-reed-cast">titled <em>Phantom Liberty</em></a>, will be <a href="https://twitter.com/CDPROJEKTRED_IR/status/1663204755303288832">playable at the in-person Play Days portion</a> of Summer Game Fest, so I’m guessing it will make an appearance during the live event.
