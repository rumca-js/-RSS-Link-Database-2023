<p>After Elon Musk finalized his purchase of Twitter last October, Mark Zuckerberg's Meta <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-decentralized-twitter-competitor-071316333.html">reportedly began working</a> on a social media platform of its own, codenamed Project 92. During a company-wide meeting on Thursday, Meta chief product officer Chris Cox showed off a set UI mock-ups to the assembled employees, which were promptly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/8/23754304/instagram-meta-twitter-competitor-threads-activitypub">leaked online</a>.</p><p>The project's existence was first officially <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-decentralized-twitter-competitor-071316333.html">confirmed in March</a> when the company told reporters, &quot;We're exploring a standalone decentralized social network for sharing text updates. We believe there's an opportunity for a separate space where creators and public figures can share timely updates about their interests.&quot; A set of design images <a href="https://www.engadget.com/metas-rumored-twitter-competitor-could-launch-as-early-as-next-month-181625616.html">shared internally in May</a> were leaked online as well.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The new platform, which Cox referred to as “our response to Twitter,” will be a standalone program, based on Instagram and integrating ActivityPub, the same networking protocol that powers Mastodon. The leaked images include a shot of the secure sign in screen; the main feed, which looks suspiciously like Twitter's existing mobile app; and the reply screen. There's no word yet on when the app will be available for public release.</p><p>“We’ve been hearing from creators and public figures who are interested in having a platform that is sanely run, that they believe that they can trust and rely upon for distribution,” Cox said, per a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/8/23754304/instagram-meta-twitter-competitor-threads-activitypub"><em>Verge report</em></a>. Celebrities including Oprah and the Dalai Lama have both reportedly been attached to the project.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/screenshots-of-instagrams-answer-to-twitter-leak-online-212427998.html?src=rss

<p>Between the likes of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/skate/"><em>Skate</em></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cult-of-the-lamb-devolver-release-date-223042486.html"><em>Skate Story</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/olliolli-world-gameplay-preview-140021521.html"><em>OlliOlli World</em></a>, we're in the midst of a renaissance of skateboarding games. <em>Helskate</em> looks like it's going in a different direction from many of them. It uses skateboarding as a foundation for monster slaying.</p><p>In this project from Phantom Coast, you'll make your way through the hellscape of Vertheim with arcade-style skating. You'll power up attacks by pulling off combos, and unlock abilities and buffs as you progress. Ultimately, you'll need to battle the Gods of Skating. You'll need to conquer a score challenge to defeat one and grind up another to target its weak points.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Since this is a roguelite, some progress will carry over when you die, but otherwise you'll be starting again. You'll be able to put together a unique build for each run by combining weapons, gear and tapes.

<p>Summer Game Fest's final reveal was the sequel...est of all sequels: <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em>'s second chapter, <em>Rebirth</em>. It will take Cloud, Aerith and the rest of the team beyond Midgar, and we got a glimpse and expanded areas for exploration, tapping into the power of the PS5.&nbsp;</p><p>The start of the trailer, however, teases alternate timelines and events yet again, with the collapse of the expressway (the end of <em>FF7: Remake) </em>showing injured party members being stretchered onto helicopters,  before returning to more familiar story beats for anyone who's played the original.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="19de50137a48486d9521adb6822a943d"></div><p>We'll get flashbacks to Tifa and Cloud's reunion in the town of Kalm, where they both grew up, and more Sephiroth chewing up scenes with vague dialogue and gorgeous hair. We also see secondary antagonists, the Turks, with a full roster, ready to go three-on-three against your party.&nbsp;</p><p>The most intriguing snippets were battles showing  Cloud et al. able to collaborate with each other on their moves, upping the damage. It's something we saw in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/final-fantasy-vii-intergrade-intermission-review-130017993.html"><em>FF7R's </em>DLC</a> with Yuffie and her ally Sonan. The trailer also gave us the first glimpse of both Yuffie and Red XIII (the talking dog) duking it out alongside the rest of the party. The game has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-launch-date-2023-ps5-101509333.html">delayed</a>, to early 2024 now, but we now know it'll land on two discs — if that's any consolation.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-rebirth-is-delayed-to-early-2024-211301245.html?src=rss

<p>Epic Games is about to decimate the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/fortnite/"><em>Fortnite</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>island once again. The battle royale's latest season, dubbed Fortnite Wilds, commences on June 9th, and a cinematic trailer debuted for it during Summer Game Fest Live.</p><p>This time around, Epic is revamping the island by collapsing the center of it to reveal a jungle. You'll be able to ride colorful velociraptors and explore ancient ruins. Mud and vines will play roles in the season as well. Somehow, all of that ties into a Transformers collaboration as Optimus Prime make an appearance. As it happens, a new Transformers movie is in theaters this week.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There's not much cohesion between the jungle theme and the latest crossover, but it doesn't really matter. Millions of people will rush to play the new season anyway. Besides, let's face it: tearing around the island on the back of a raptor while wearing an Optimus Prime skin could be fun.</p><div id="a2c171d6291c492f8e0d0adbe0f34e84"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p><em>Catch up on all of the news from Summer Game Fest </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/sgf-2023"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/fortnites-next-season-features-transformers-and-rideable-raptors-210411943.html?src=rss

<p>If you’ve played the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-06-01-altos-adventure-zen-mode.html">adorably zen Alto series</a> you know what to expect on a vibe level. Summerhill leans hard on the pastoral setting, emphasizing chill puzzle solving at your own pace. The graphics recall the Alto series and other indie standouts like <em>Monument Valley.</em> To that end, the composer behind <em>Monument Valley 2,</em> Todd Baker, is here to deliver a “folk-inspired” soundtrack.</p><p></p><div id="5cc86bc8e91a42a7a5a54a6587a80e1c"></div><p>On the gameplay front, the dev promises “fluid herding-based gameplay” and “gentle problem-solving,&quot; along with a narrative mystery regarding the landscape’s ancient past. You’ll also be herding and corralling your sheep along with your trusty dog, all while honing skills to tackle “increasingly more complex puzzles.” The narrative is wordless but the dev promises it’s rife with &quot;themes of duty, companionship and morality.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“<em>Summerhill</em> is an entirely new IP that aims to build on the themes that we care about most as a studio,” writes Land &amp; Sea founder Harry Nesbitt. “In many ways, sheep herding is in our DNA and we really wanted to do justice to this timeless tradition and tell a story that could only be told in this way.”</p><p>There’s no release date yet, as the title is currently in active development, but it’s far enough along for a trailer. This team has been busy lately. Some members, regrouped as Snowman Games, recently launched <a href="https://www.engadget.com/layas-horizon-a-sandbox-wingsuit-game-from-the-studio-behind-altos-odyssey-arrives-may-2nd-150033749.html">an exclusive title for Netflix.</a></p><p><em>Catch up on all of the news from Summer Game Fest </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/sgf-2023"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/altos-adventure-devs-announce-new-game-and-its-all-about-sheep-herding-210022181.html?src=rss

<p>Sega's Japanese gangster series, Yakuza (or Like a Dragon), will continue in <em>Like a Dragon 8</em>, but the company also teased a separate title that would continue the story of the series' protagonist from the first six games. Yes, Kiryu Kazuma is back, but well, without the name.&nbsp;</p><p>The laboriously named <em>Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Nam</em>e will focus on<em>&nbsp;</em>Kiryu, who, having faked his death, is back on the mean, incredibly reflective streets of Japan. According to leaks earlier this week, will feature two fighting styles, including 'agent' techniques that appear to be both gadget-heavy and remind me a lot of Link's Ultrahand from what is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-a-familiar-but-fresh-adventure-120035307.html">probably the best game of 2023. </a>Oh, and <em>Spider-Man</em>.

## Mark Zuckerberg says generative AI is coming to ‘every single one of our products’

<p>Meta’s generative AI plans are starting to come into focus. Though the company hasn’t adopted much in the way of generative AI features yet, Mark Zuckerberg has made it clear he wants Meta to be viewed as one of the leaders in the field.</p><p>Now, <em>Axios </em><a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/06/08/meta-ai-zuckerberg-announcement-generative"><ins>reports</ins></a> that at a companywide all-hands meeting this week, Zuckerberg laid out some of Meta’s plans in more detail. The CEO reportedly briefed employees on some of the ways Meta plans to put generative AI “into every single one of our products.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The planned features include AI “agents” for WhatsApp and Messenger, something that Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-is-working-on-ai-personas-for-instagram-messenger-and-whatsapp-223316961.html"><ins>has discussed</ins></a> in the past. And while <em>Axios</em> reports that WhatsApp and Messenger may be first to get the feature, an early version of an AI chatbot was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-may-roll-out-its-own-ai-chatbot-in-the-near-future-200631539.html"><ins>spotted</ins></a> in the Instagram app this week by app researcher Alessandro Paluzzi. Screenshots he shared indicated the app could have as many as 30 different “personalities” to choose from.</p><p>Also in the works, according to <em>Axios</em>: generative AI photo editing in Instagram. The feature would apparently allow users to edit their photos via text prompts and then share the images back to their Story. Zuckerberg has also recently discussed — during the company's most recent <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-is-still-growing-amid-metas-year-of-efficiency-222320433.html">earnings</a> call — post creation tools for Facebook, as well as for the platform’s advertisers.</p><p>It’s still unclear just how soon some of these features may launch, but it sounds like Zuckerberg is hoping to see them sooner than later. The company is also hoping employees will come up with some ideas for new generative AI features of their own and is reportedly hosting an internal hackathon to inspire potential new ideas.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mark-zuckerberg-says-generative-ai-is-coming-to-every-single-one-of-our-products-204741820.html?src=rss

<p>From <em>Halloween</em> to <em>The Thing</em>, <em>Christine</em> to <em>They Live, </em>John Carpenter is a modern master of cinematic horror. During Summer Games Fest on Thursday, Focus Home Entertainment and Saber Interactive announced that his unique zompocalyptic vision will be coming to Xbox X|S, the Epic Games Store and Playstation 5 in 2024 with the release of <em>John Carpenter's Toxic Commando</em>.</p><div id="c8414146bf9a4203a7eaefe00a186dc4"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>The game's premise, based on the trailer that debuted on Thursday, is straightforward: you see a zombie, you shoot it until it stops twitching. The plot is equally nuanced, wherein an experiment seeking to draw energy from the Earth's core has instead unleashed an ambulatory zombie plague known as the Sludge God.

<p><em>Alan Wake II</em> is finally happening, as the long-awaited sequel is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/alan-wake-ii-will-drop-on-october-17th-for-xbox-series-x-ps5-and-pc-210405566.html">set to arrive in October</a>. Remedy creative director Sam Lake made an appearance at Summer Game Fest Live to reveal more details and show off some new gameplay.</p><p>Remedy's first survival horror game has two lead characters. Newcomer Saga Anderson, an FBI agent, is joining Alan Wake this time. Lake revealed that there will be a 50-50 split between each character's story. You'll start the game as Saga and have the choice to switch between her and Alan at certain points throughout the game.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="4014a32cc1da4049b1370bde44d72770"></div><p>Saga and her partner travel to a small town in the Pacific Northwest to &quot;investigate a series of ritualistic murders,&quot; Lake said. However, their mission becomes a living horror story that may or may not have been crafted by a certain writer.</p><p>The gameplay Lake showed off is from an early sequence. It centers around supernatural forces resurrecting a murder victim as a monster that Saga has to battle. The clip opens with her walking through some woods and an abandoned building with the help of her trusty flashlight before she encounters said beast. The footage (which was followed by a short trailer) looks appropriately spooky. Remedy tossed in a couple jump scares for good measure.</p><p>You'll be able to find out for yourself just how scary <em>Alan Wake II</em> truly is soon enough. It's coming to Xbox Series X, PS5 and PC via the Epic Games Store on October 17th.</p><div id="36ff69a56c144c5ea6e37ad72d5ddc19"></div><p><em>Catch up on all of the news from Summer Game Fest </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/sgf-2023"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/alan-wake-ii-gameplay-shows-newcomer-saga-battling-a-resurrected-murder-victim-202108350.html?src=rss

<p>Sonic the Hedgehog is returning with a modern look. The Sega Genesis mascot (and friends) will star in <em>Sonic Superstars</em>, a new take on the 2D platform franchise that trades in his classic 16-bit graphics for a contemporary coat of paint.</p><p>The game’s trailer starts by showing the cartoon hedgehog completing the Green Hill Zone in the 1991 original, only to find himself in a split-screen view that catapults his appearance into 2023 standards. Apart from the updated graphics, the title showcases familiar gameplay, some new tricks and a well-known supporting cast — including Tails, Knuckles and Amy Rose. Unsurprisingly, they’re on a mission to take down Dr. Eggman (aka Dr. Robotnik). It also showcases co-cop gameplay with friends.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="2ca75349aadb4ee7958bdc5401f409ab"></div><p><em>Sonic Superstars</em> is scheduled to launch this fall.

<p>In the middle of this year’s Summer Games Fest, Geoff Keighley teased a new game with characters from a storied manga artist – and he wasn’t kidding. <em>Sand Land</em> is a new adventure game from Bandai Namco, featuring character design from Akira Toriyama, the man who gave us Dragon Ball’s Goku, the art of the Dragon Quest series, the characters of <em>Chrono Trigger,</em> not to mention countless more manga titles. Sand Land was initially a short manga series written back in 2000 by Toriyama. Now it’s a game. (In fact, in the trailer you can see the protagonist play around with what appears to be a Gameboy Advance, which is cute.)</p><div id="cbaebc2c4a29486c8d41567446b04a5f"></div><p>We got a quick tour of what kind of game Sandland will be, as you’ll take control of a demonic prince, Beelzebub, alongside a cohort of monstrous characters, exploring, well, sandy environments. While you’ll be able to go toe-to-toe with some enemies,  you’ll also pilot tanks to gun down enemies from afar, or go up against other military hardware. There appears to be a whole array of vehicles to explore the desert with. There's no release date yet, but hopefully, we’ll hear more in the following days.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p></p><p><em>Catch up on all of the news from Summer Game Fest </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/sgf-2023"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/sand-land-trailer-sgf-2023-akira-toriyama-200242482.html?src=rss

<p>Reddit CEO Steve Huffman will publicly address the community for the first time over the company’s planned API changes that have sparked mass outrage on the platform. “Reddit CEO, u/spez, will be here tomorrow to host an AMA about the latest API updates, including accessibility, mod bots, and third-party mod tools,” the company shared in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/144ho2x/join_our_ceo_tomorrow_to_discuss_the_api/"><ins>brief update</ins></a>.</p><p>A Reddit spokesperson said the AMA would likely kick off around 10:30 AM PT on Friday, June 9th. News of the AMA comes just after the developers of Apollo and RIF, two of the most popular third-party reddit clients, said they would be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/third-party-reddit-app-apollo-will-shut-down-on-june-30th-174305150.html"><ins>shutting down</ins></a> their apps at the end of the month due to the company’s new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/reddit-app-developer-says-the-sites-new-api-rules-will-cost-him-20-million-a-year-203911487.html">API pricing</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The AMA will take place just three days before a mass protest among much of the Reddit community over the controversial changes.

<p>The spotted lanternfly may look innocent, but these ravenous creatures have been known to decimate crops, causing <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c6c965be-a8ea-473d-89f4-9754f2675a60&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Nature+Research&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjNmM5NjViZS1hOGVhLTQ3M2QtODlmNC05NzU0ZjI2NzVhNjAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmF0dXJlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9zNDE1OTgtMDIyLTI1OTg5LTMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImM4YzQ0MWI0LWM5OTMtNGRlYi04ZWRlLTgzNTE3OGIzYmJkOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAegStjv49wqw-o_vA_GS2OvAOkXEef635zWx_37tbqyi&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41598-022-25989-3"><ins>more than $500 million in damages</ins></a> to various fruit trees since being accidentally introduced to this country nearly a decade ago. The big idea right now is to introduce several species of wasps into the mid-atlantic ecosystem to hunt and eat the lanternflies, but students at <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/news/2023/tartan-pest"><ins>Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics Institute</ins></a> have developed an alternative plan in the form of a robot death machine.</p><p>It’s called TartanPest and uses a combination of technologies and components to autonomously hunt down and destroy lanternfly egg masses. It starts with an electric tractor for movement and a suite of cameras for traversal. This computer vision is also constantly on the hunt for egg masses, containing up to 50 lanternfly eggs. Once it finds a mass on a tree, rock or even a rust metal surface, a robot arm with a spinning brush attachment goes in for the kill, scrubbing the eggs away like so much trash.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="0af7723c24c74dec977771da1c4ebb9c"></div><p>"Currently, spotted lanternflies are concentrated in the eastern portion of the nation, but they are predicted to spread to the whole country," said Carolyn Alex, an undergraduate researcher on the TartanPest team. "By investing in this issue now, we will be saving higher costs in the future."</p><p>There’s some deep-learning algorithms at work here to locate the egg masses, trained using a large image data set. The robot does work autonomously but requires a human on-hand to fix any issues as they arise. So it’s probably not the most efficient way to eradicate spotted lanternflies. Still, it’s pretty darned cool and everybody loves a good killer robot.</p><p>This is just a prototype design for now, as the team designed the construct as part of <a href="https://farm-ng.com/pages/farm-ng-uc-anr-farmbot-ai-challenge-details"><ins>Farm-ng's 2023 Farm Robotics Challenge.</ins></a> In other words, if lanternflies are getting you down, you have a while to wait before you can unleash an army of killer robots.

<p>E3 may be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/e3-2023-has-been-canceled-211201976.html">dead</a>, but Summer Game Fest kicks off today with an opening-night livestream from the YouTube Theater in Los Angeles.</p><p>The show is expected to run for two hours, featuring game announcements and updates from many of the industry's most prominent studios and indie publishers. Nearly every big hitter is a partner, including PlayStation, Xbox, EA, Activision and Square Enix. Notable absentees from the show’s promotional materials include Nintendo and Ubisoft. Nintendo participated in E3 when that show was still a thing, but it's not terribly surprising to see the company skip Summer Game Fest, considering it just dropped <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>. Ubisoft has its own event on Monday, but it isn't officially tied to Summer Game Fest — Ubisoft's name was on the show's website until this week, but it's been scrubbed from the schedule and partner list.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Organized by the team behind The Game Awards, Summer Game Fest’s live event is the first of 10 streams taking place between June 7th and June 12th (plus a bonus Ubisoft event). The opening show will be followed immediately by a Day of the Devs stream from Double Fine and iam8bit, highlighting a number of games from independent developers. You can see the full Summer Game Fest schedule, including what to expect from each show, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/summer-game-fest-2023-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect-161527893.html">here</a>.</p><div id="598527e52013455e9168027c40bcdf09"></div>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/watch-summer-game-fest-2023-here-at-3pm-et-170045929.html?src=rss

## Summer Game Fest 2023 and the stagnant state of the industry

<p>The video game industry is larger than it’s ever been. The biggest companies are worth trillions of dollars and dozens more operate in the billions. In terms of social impact, video games are an established, powerful segment of the art and entertainment landscape. In 2023, the state of the video game market is, “big and getting bigger.” So why, from a player perspective, does it feel like the industry is shrinking?</p><p>It’s been four years since the last big video game showcase in the US. E3 2019 marked the last time the industry met in Los Angeles for a week of game and hardware announcements, and it’s finally happening again this year, just under new management. Summer Game Fest kicks off today, June 8th, and it’s organized by the team behind The Game Awards, rather than the Entertainment Software Association. There’s going to be a main live show at 3PM ET and multiple follow-up streams focused on indie games, plus events from Xbox, Ubisoft and Capcom running through June 12th.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The format of Summer Game Fest certainly looks familiar, but the industry itself has changed drastically since the last big summer showcase. The Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 have been on the market for more than two years, subscription-based cloud services are actually viable, and the indie and AA space has found its footing again. Meanwhile, the largest companies in the room have been on an acquisition spree, with Microsoft and Sony buying talented studios in a bid to pad their new platforms with exclusive games.&nbsp;</p><p>For the full story, watch the video below.&nbsp;</p><div id="67aa1486bbb9436ebc26e59dec840975"></div><p><em>Catch up on all of the news from Summer Game Fest </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/sgf-2023"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/summer-game-fest-2023-and-the-stagnant-state-of-the-industry-163019962.html?src=rss

## Google Password Manager gets new security and usability features

<p><a href="https://passwords.google/">Google Password Manager</a> is having a mini overhaul with a bunch of new security and convenience features rolling out on desktop and iOS devices. One of them is even designed to get you using it properly in the first place, by allowing you to upload a .csv file from a rival service.</p><p>The storage system also now has a dedicated space in Chrome that you can access through &quot;Password Manager&quot; in Chrome's menu or &quot;Manage passwords&quot; when asked if you want to save a new credential. It's accessible through a new desktop shortcut option as well. Once on the landing page, you can click on specific websites to view saved information or reconfigure your settings. If you're an iOS user accessing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-password-manager-chrome-ios-android-sompromised-weak-passwords-160006685.html">Google Password Manager</a>, you'll also now have a larger pop-up for auto-filling passwords and be able to see your accounts for a specific website all in one place.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The last big Google Password Manager convenience update is the addition of notes to your saved login details. If there's an extra pin or security question you need to remember the answer to, that information can now live right with that account's password. All you need to do is select the password, click &quot;note,&quot; and then &quot;edit.&quot; Once you've added the information, just hit save, and it will be securely stored. At login, click the key icon to access what you wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>On the security side of things, Google is adding more <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-biometric-authentication-account-linking-080030297.html">biometric authentication</a> options on your desktop. This measure enables you to require a fingerprint or facial recognition before your password auto-fills. It's certainly a good option if you share a computer and want to keep your accounts private. On iOS, Google Password Manager will flag reused and weak passwords in the &quot;Password Checkup&quot; tab — where compromised password alerts live. The additional flags will roll out in the coming months, while biometric authentication for desktop should be available &quot;soon.&quot; You can access all of the convenience updates now.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-password-manager-gets-new-security-and-usability-features-035347775.html?src=rss

<p>Dads love cameras, both as a way to capture special moments and just as fun gadgets. If your father wants to go beyond their smartphone, a new camera would certainly be a welcomed gift. The question is, what type does he need and how much should you spend? We found some of the best models with the latest tech, like fast shooting speeds, sharp video and incredible autofocus. Better still, they cover a wide range of prices, and we’ve also recommended some accessories to complement the gear your dear father already owns.</p><h2>GoPro Hero 11 Black</h2><p></p><p>GoPro didn’t change the design on its latest model, but it has a larger sensor that enables a couple of cool features – Horizon Lock stabilization and Full Frame mode that makes it easier to shoot for, say, TikTok and YouTube at the same time. Otherwise, the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=06fa1f29-e83c-49e4-81a8-9732450da8a9&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GoPro&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIwNmZhMWYyOS1lODNjLTQ5ZTQtODFhOC05NzMyNDUwZGE4YTkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9nb3Byby5jb20vZW4vdXMvc2hvcC9jYW1lcmFzL2hlcm8xMS1ibGFjay9DSERIWC0xMTEtbWFzdGVyLmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjZiMzdlNzg2LTQwMTQtNGY2Ni1hMGU3LWM4YzIwOWNjMjc4NyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAT3Suz2up8xJ7UAs60GCai-Vh37T_R2nKWY0dcJMmia7&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fgopro.com%2Fen%2Fus%2Fshop%2Fcameras%2Fhero11-black%2FCHDHX-111-master.html">Hero 11 Black</a> offers better video quality than ever (up to 5.3K 60p), Hypersmooth stabilization that’s still the best in the business (by far), battery life that’s improved by 40 percent over the last model, and more. The best action product on the market is not the cheapest – but if your dad is serious about filming his exploits, it’s well worth it.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Canon EOS M50 II and EOS R100</h2><p></p><p><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9DYW5vbi1NYXJrLUVGLU0tMTUtNDVtbS1CbGFjay9kcC9CMDhLU0tWMzVDP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTEyOC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNmIzN2U3ODYtNDAxNC00ZjY2LWEwZTctYzhjMjA5Y2MyNzg3In0&amp;signature=AQAAARc8rwOJnSCb4rp_crOQkqj-9AmRXZCV8EhgOIRNCEuy&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCanon-Mark-EF-M-15-45mm-Black%2Fdp%2FB08KSKV35C">Canon’s EOS M50 II</a> is three years old, but with current deals, it’s the best value camera you can give your dad right now. It offers features like a 24.2-megapixel sensor, flip-out screen, tap-to-record and focus, plus 4K video with a 1.5x crop. Its light weight makes it a great travel camera, with the flip-out display allowing your father to shoot selfies or do some vlogging. If you want to pay less and your dad can wait an extra month, though, Canon just released the 24.2-megapixel <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=95276f3c-7b79-4c1e-803f-981cd9f7a968&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=B%26H+Photo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5NTI3NmYzYy03Yjc5LTRjMWUtODAzZi05ODFjZDlmN2E5NjgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmhwaG90b3ZpZGVvLmNvbS9jL3Byb2R1Y3QvMTc2OTA4OS1SRUcvY2Fub25fZW9zX3IxMDBfbWlycm9ybGVzc19jYW1lcmEuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNmIzN2U3ODYtNDAxNC00ZjY2LWEwZTctYzhjMjA5Y2MyNzg3In0&amp;signature=AQAAAS-47unU3K8TkIByHJEfRkkh2NnA5yk9DfD9WU5WxQPq&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1769089-REG%2Fcanon_eos_r100_mirrorless_camera.html">R100</a>. It has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-eos-r100-is-canons-cheapest-r-series-mirrorless-camera-yet-084049616.html">most of the features</a> of the M50 II, but lacks a flip-out display. It’s priced at just $480 for the body only, or $600 with a 16-50mm lens, which makes it the cheapest mirrorless camera on the market. You can pre-order it now, but shipping is set for July.</p><h2>Canon EOS R50</h2><p></p><p>Still in the budget category but stepping up a notch is Canon’s 24-megapixel APS-C <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9DYW5vbi1NaXJyb3JsZXNzLVByb2Nlc3Nvci1TbWFydHBob25lLUNvbm5lY3Rpb24vZHAvQjBCVFRWSDdWRj90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby0xMjgtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjZiMzdlNzg2LTQwMTQtNGY2Ni1hMGU3LWM4YzIwOWNjMjc4NyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAbbwInhI_jZgyVlFymwaDYe2SjpwzLk0Ipc5xOZpXg8A&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCanon-Mirrorless-Processor-Smartphone-Connection%2Fdp%2FB0BTTVH7VF">R50</a>, which will suit your dad whether he does photography or video. It can shoot bursts at up to 15 fps in electronic shutter mode, and offers 4K 10-bit video at up to 30p with supersampling and no crop. It has a fully articulating display, and unlike other cameras in this price range, an electronic viewfinder. It uses Canon’s Dual Pixel AF with subject recognition mode, and even has a popup flash. The only drawback is the lack of in-body stabilization, but the electronic stabilization is very effective with the price of a slight crop.</p><h2>Sony Alpha ZV-E10</h2><p></p><p>If your father is a content creator, Sony’s 24.2-megapixel <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Tb255LUFscGhhLVpWLUUxMC1JbnRlcmNoYW5nZWFibGUtTWlycm9ybGVzcy9kcC9CMDlCQkxINFNHP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTEyOC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNmIzN2U3ODYtNDAxNC00ZjY2LWEwZTctYzhjMjA5Y2MyNzg3In0&amp;signature=AQAAAflUKG2N8L3FLfek5I0il3vPCY4FbAAtXkIc9sKbVWIQ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSony-Alpha-ZV-E10-Interchangeable-Mirrorless%2Fdp%2FB09BBLH4SG">ZV-E10</a> APS-C camera is a strong budget option. It can shoot sharp, downsampled 4K video at up to 30 fps with a 1.23x crop (or 1080p at 120 fps) and uses Sony’s fantastic AI-powered autofocus system with face and eye detection. It also has a few creator-specific features like Product Showcase and a bokeh switch that makes the background as blurry as possible so your subject stands out. Another nice feature is the high-quality microphone that lets you vlog without the need to buy an external mic. The main drawbacks are the lack of an EVF and rolling shutter.</p><h2>Nikon Z5</h2><p></p><p>Nothing will enhance your father’s photos like the sweet bokeh of a full-frame camera, and the 24-megapixel <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9OaWtvbi0xNjQ5LUNhbWVyYS1Cb2R5LUJsYWNrL2RwL0IwOERDSk5UQlg_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMTI4LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2YjM3ZTc4Ni00MDE0LTRmNjYtYTBlNy1jOGMyMDljYzI3ODcifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQxcXZ-QZViU7ihkPiXnAL7S_teCaR9zeb0JgQwWw4fp&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNikon-1649-Camera-Body-Black%2Fdp%2FB08DCJNTBX">Nikon Z5</a> is a stellar deal right now. It’s mostly aimed at photographers, with features like hybrid phase-detect autofocus and Nikon’s excellent color science. And for such a budget option, it has desirable features like five-axis in-body stabilization, dual fast UHS-II card slots, a 3.69 million dot OLED electronic viewfinder and a tilting touch display. Video isn’t a strong point, but it can handle 4K 30p with a crop and 1080p at 60fps.</p><h2>Canon EOS R8</h2><p></p><p>Moving up in price, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9DYW5vbi1GdWxsLUZyYW1lLU1pcnJvcmxlc3MtTGlnaHR3ZWlnaHQtU21hcnRwaG9uZS9kcC9CMEJUVFRINUc2P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTEyOC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNmIzN2U3ODYtNDAxNC00ZjY2LWEwZTctYzhjMjA5Y2MyNzg3In0&amp;signature=AQAAAbfCckDPUAoz1EqAwqaf-Kg2VYaqfI1eIzbua1nKbaLl&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCanon-Full-Frame-Mirrorless-Lightweight-Smartphone%2Fdp%2FB0BTTTH5G6">Canon’s EOS R8</a> is a better-rounded option if your dad likes shooting video as much as taking photos. It has the company’s excellent Dual Pixel AF with subject recognition AI, and can shoot bursts at up to 40 fps. It's equally strong with video, supporting oversampled 10-bit 4K at up to 60 fps. The R8 also offers a flip-out display, making it great for vloggers. The main drawback is a lack of in-body stabilization.</p><h2>Panasonic Lumix S5 II and S5 IIX</h2><p></p><p>For dads who take their content creation very seriously, check out <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9QYW5hc29uaWMtTWlycm9ybGVzcy1DYW1lcmEtVGVjaG5vbG9neS1VbmxpbWl0ZWQvZHAvQjBCUjhHMkY1Sz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby0xMjgtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjZiMzdlNzg2LTQwMTQtNGY2Ni1hMGU3LWM4YzIwOWNjMjc4NyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAcXV3HZlW_WgMo34Fsd7eh90j6CkrhvxJv1tV4CXYp3g&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPanasonic-Mirrorless-Camera-Technology-Unlimited%2Fdp%2FB0BR8G2F5K">Panasonic’s full-frame S5 II</a>. It’s the company’s first camera with hybrid phase-detect AF designed to make focus "wobble" and other issues a thing of the past. He can shoot sharp 4K 30p video downsampled from the full sensor width, or 4K 60p from an APS-C cropped size, all in 10-bit color. It even offers 5.9K 30p capture, along with RAW 5.9K external output to an Atomos recorder. It also has a flip-out screen for vlogging and updated five-axis in-body stabilization that’s the best in the industry. The main drawback is the slowish burst speeds, but it’s made for video more than photography.

It’s built with a lightweight yet durable 100-percent waterproof recycled 400D shell with the ingenious Flexfold dividers in the main storage area. It also offers a pair of zipped pockets, two elastic side pockets and a compartment big enough for a 13- to 15-inch laptop. I own one myself and find it practical both for work and daily activities, letting me fit a camera, lens and laptop along with my wallet and keys. At $230, it’s not the cheapest bag out there, but your dad won’t have to buy another for a good while.</p><h2>Magnus VT-4000 tripod</h2><p></p><p>For dads serious about video, the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9NYWdudXMtVlQtNDAwMC1Qcm9mZXNzaW9uYWwtUGVyZm9ybWFuY2UtVHJpcG9kL2RwL0IwMDhPTTFHQ1c_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMTI4LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2YjM3ZTc4Ni00MDE0LTRmNjYtYTBlNy1jOGMyMDljYzI3ODcifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAeF-UbaCuDYHHxlPF0F1AmMJKgrbicyh8FhEK1vCqso2&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMagnus-VT-4000-Professional-Performance-Tripod%2Fdp%2FB008OM1GCW">Magnus VT 4000</a> is the best budget tripod option. It’s stout enough to handle a mirrorless camera and accessories weighing up to 8.8 pounds, more than the eight-pound weight of the tripod itself. That lack of heft makes it practical for travel, while the fluid head helps you tilt and pan smoothly. Other features include a middle spreader to keep things steady and legs that extend up to 64 inches so you can match the eyeline of your subjects. All of these features come for $199, a relative steal considering the quality.</p><h2>Joby GorillaPod 3K mini tripod</h2><p></p><p>The most useful accessories out there for vlogging dads are Joby’s famous mini-tripods, and the best one for the money is the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Hb3JpbGxhUG9kLUNvbXBhY3QtQmFsbGhlYWQtTWlycm9ybGVzcy1DaGFyY29hbC9kcC9CMDc0V0M5WUtMP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTEyOC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNmIzN2U3ODYtNDAxNC00ZjY2LWEwZTctYzhjMjA5Y2MyNzg3In0&amp;signature=AQAAAVwbo5KR820anTDz9MIyszvrixvdX55WPvyPVJ0Oflv6&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGorillaPod-Compact-Ballhead-Mirrorless-Charcoal%2Fdp%2FB074WC9YKL">GorillaPod 3K</a>. Attaching your camera couldn’t be easier thanks to the secure clip-in mounting plate with a built-in level.

<p>Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-duo-meet-app-merger-210117463.html">Meet</a>, the company's answer to Zoom and Microsoft Teams, just got an update that makes the picture-in-picture (PiP) feature far more useful. Specifically, a new set of controls makes it easier to multitask during a meeting while remaining present and participating in video conferences, according to Google's <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/06/enhanced-experience-picture-in-picture-google-meet-chrome.html">Workspace Update blog post</a>.</p><p>With the picture-in-picture window open, there's now a control that lets you "raise your hand," use PiP while in meeting chat, turn captions on and off, resize the picture-in-picture view more effectively and access flexible layouts, the company said. Google shows exactly how it works in the GIF below, as a user drafts an email while still being able to see his colleagues and remain present in the video chat. Should you need to make a point, you can still raise your hand and access other controls.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Google Meet makes the picture-in-picture experience far more useful" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/39807a10-05fd-11ee-bdd6-2a8e406672a4" style="height: 1094px; width: 1600px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>That's a big change from the last version, which offered limited resizing options and a fixed aspect ratio.

(It is, by the way, expanding bikes to Chile in partnership with bike-sharing network Tembici.) Now it's including Uber Eats in that pledge.

## United is putting 4K displays and Bluetooth on its planes

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/united-airlines-flying-taxi-eve-air-mobility-embrarer-162205301.html">United</a> Airlines has struck a deal with Panasonic Avionics that could make flying in economy more bearable. No, it will not magically make the seats wider or the leg room bigger, but it will distract you with a larger, sharper in-flight entertainment display and — some will perhaps find this even more exciting — Bluetooth. The airline has announced that it's installing almost 300,000 units of Panasonic Avionics' Astrova in-flight entertainment (IFE) screens on select new Boeing 787 and Airbus A321XLR aircraft.&nbsp;</p><p>They're seatback displays that use 4K OLED technology, which promises sharper image quality and better contrast ratio than a lot of other IFE systems. The company says Astrova can also provide high fidelity 3D spatial audio through its latest Bluetooth technology. Yep, you won't need to use wired headphones anymore or bring one of those Bluetooth dongles just so you could use your wireless earbuds. Astrova also comes with USB-C ports capable of charging your phones and tablets with 100 watts of DC power.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As <a href="https://aviationweek.com/air-transport/interiors-connectivity/united-airlines-make-largest-ever-panasonic-ife-investment"><em>Aviation Week</em></a> notes, the Boeing 787 and Airbus A321XLR planes are part of United's international fleet, but the airline will reportedly equip its domestic planes with Astrova IFE systems, as well. The displays will be installed under the United Next program, which aims to put a seatback in-flight display at every seat. United plans to provide first class passengers access to 13-inch displays and passengers in economy with 10-inch IFE screens.&nbsp;</p><p>In their announcement, the companies said their agreement will allow United to upgrade the Astrova displays over the coming years. The IFE system uses a modular architecture with a removable peripheral bar that makes it easy to add newer technologies and update its Bluetooth or charging stations. No upgrade will be happening anytime soon, though — the airline isn't scheduled to start installing the in-flight entertainment systems until 2025.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/united-is-putting-4k-displays-and-bluetooth-on-its-planes-103520707.html?src=rss

## ChatGPT for iOS gets support for Siri and Shortcuts

<p>OpenAI has announced a few <a href="https://openai.com/blog/introducing-the-chatgpt-app-for-ios">new updates for its iOS app</a>, including Shortcuts integration. Now you can create a ChatGPT prompt in Shortcuts and save it as a link between the AI tool and different apps. For example, ask ChatGPT to answer a problem or look up a fact and then message the response to your friend or save it as a note. You can also now ask Siri to bring up ChatGPT or create these Shortcuts. ChatGPT for iOS already utilizes <a href="https://www.engadget.com/openai-will-let-developers-build-chatgpt-into-their-apps-204737530.html">OpenAI's Whisper speech recognition</a> for voice input, with Siri further expanding its accessibility.&nbsp;</p><p>A new drag and drop feature further integrates ChatGPT across iOS devices, letting you pull messages out of its interface and into other apps.

<p>WhatsApp has launched a new feature called Channels that makes it much more like a social media app, the Meta-owned company <a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/introducing-whatsapp-channels-a-private-way-to-follow-what-matters">announced</a>. It allows accounts to send one-way broadcasts to followers in the form of &quot;text, photos, videos, stickers and polls,&quot; much as you can with an app like Twitter. Broadcasting accounts can decide who's allowed to follow their channel, whether they want it to be discoverable and more. At the same time, &quot;following a channel won’t reveal your phone number to the admin or other followers,&quot; WhatsApp said.</p><p>Users can find channels in a new tab on the app called Updates. That area shows Status and channels you decide to follow, separate from chats with family, friends and group chats/communities. For creators who plan to use the feature, WhatsApp will eventually add payment services to monetize it.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Privacy is also key, the company said. A channel's admin info isn't shared and it only retains 30 days of history. Admins can also prevent followers from taking screenshots or forwarding messages. Channels aren't end-to-end encrypted, but WhatsApp said it's exploring the idea for non-profits, health organizations or other privacy-sensitive organizations.</p><div id="427c965c6f5641c4845815499f2e9e29"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>Channels is more or less a copy of a similar feature on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/telegram-channel-ads-192249765.html">rival chat app Telegram</a> of the same name. Earlier this year, Meta <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-is-bringing-telegram-like-channels-to-instagram-184054107.html?guccounter=1">launched</a> Broadcast Channels on Instagram, allowing creators to stream <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/02/instagram-broadcast-channels-creators-deepen-connections-with-followers/">updates</a> to their followers’ inboxes much as WhatsApp users will be able to do. The feature can be likened to a newsletter, and in fact, it <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/whatsapp-channels-rumored-newsletter-tool/">may have been called</a> Newsletter while still under development (or the latter could arrive later as a separate feature).</p><p>WhatsApp is evolving well beyond it's original purpose as a simple messaging app. Meta recently added the ability to use <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-now-lets-you-use-your-account-on-multiple-phones-163158921.html">one account on multiple devices</a>, something that was not only impossible before, but potentially created a hassle when you changed phones. The company has also updated group chats, while adding polls, shopping and more.</p><p>The new feature is not launching widely, but starting with &quot;leading global organizations and select organizations in Columbia and Singapore,&quot; the company said. It'll arrive to more countries and users down the road &quot;in the coming months.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/whatsapps-new-channels-feature-lets-accounts-send-one-way-updates-to-followers-090843232.html?src=rss

## FCC orders Avid Telecom to stop health insurance-related robocalls

<p>The Federal Communications Commission has <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-looks-cut-insurance-related-robocall-campaign">issued</a> a cease-and-desist letter to Avid Telecom, the same company sued by nearly all Attorneys General in the US for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/company-responsible-for-75-billion-robocalls-sued-by-nearly-every-attorney-general-220050450.html">alleged robocall activities</a>. In the <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-394134A1.pdf">letter</a> (PDF) addressed to Avid CEO Michael Lansky, the FCC said it has determined that the company &quot;is apparently originating illegal robocall traffic on behalf of one or more of its clients.&quot; The commission explained that it worked with USTelecom’s Industry Traceback Group, which investigated prerecorded telemarketing calls related to health insurance that the aforementioned state attorneys general identified as robocalls made without consent.</p><p>Apparently, their investigation determined that Avid originated the calls. When notified about the calls, Avid told the traceback group that its customer obtained consent through opt-in websites, but the FCC explained in its letter that the customer &quot;failed to make adequate disclosures to obtain consent.&quot; That is, it didn't tell people that their consent authorizes the caller &quot;to deliver advertisements or telemarketing messages using an auto-dialer or an artificial or prerecorded voice.&quot; In some cases, the customer allegedly called people even after they revoked their consent.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The FCC has outlined the steps Avid has to take to address the issue, starting by investigating the identified traffic. Then, it has to implement measures that can prevent new and existing customers from using its network to make illegal calls. Within 48 hours of receiving the letter, Avid is required to update the FCC with the measures it has taken to mitigate robocalls coming from its network. After that, it has to inform the commission of the safeguards it has implemented to prevent its customers from using its network to make robocalls. The FCC warned that if Avid fails to comply, downstream voice service providers might permanently block all of Avid’s traffic.&nbsp;</p><p>In late May, Attorneys General from 48 states filed a lawsuit against the Arizona-based VoIP services provider, accusing it of being the origin for over 7.5 billion calls to people on the National Do Not Call Registry. According to the lawsuit, Avid spoofed phone numbers and made calls appear as if they were from government offices, law enforcement agencies and companies like Amazon. The Attorneys General are asking the court to issue an injunction on Avid for making robocalls and to make the company pay for damages and restitution to the people it called illegally.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/fcc-orders-avid-telecom-to-stop-health-insurance-related-robocalls-064428940.html?src=rss
