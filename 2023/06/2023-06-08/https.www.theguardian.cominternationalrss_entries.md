<p>The Manchester City striker is following in the footsteps of his father and Lars Bohinen, among others</p><p>When Alf-Inge Haaland made his Nottingham Forest debut in February 1994, featuring in a resounding win over Leicester, it was the latest step in a quiet revolution that helped define the Premier League’s course. Haaland and his compatriot Lars Bohinen were heavily involved in Forest’s return to the top flight that spring and, back then, neither player could have predicted where Norway’s influence on English football would lead.</p><p>“We were kind of pioneers at the time,” says Bohinen, who joined Forest from Young Boys that season, of the influx that crossed the North Sea. “We didn’t make any waves, we were just constantly being professional and producing performances. I think that’s why we had so many players doing well in England.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/08/we-were-pioneers-the-norwegians-who-transformed-the-premier-league-before-erling-haaland">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Australian’s dominant century in the World Test Championship final against India strikes an ominous note before the Ashes</p><p>From time to time around the Oval press box, little English-accented groans of annoyance burbled through the quiet. “Oh God. Here we go again.” Steve Smith was the cause, across the first two days of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/08/cricket-australia-india-world-test-championship-final-day-two-match-report">World Test Championship fina</a>l. Through the tinted windows placed just behind the bowler’s arm at the Vauxhall End was the perfect view of him, ball after ball: setting up outside leg stump, stepping across, nudging off his pads for a run on his way to 121.<br /><br />For British scribes who covered their last home Ashes in 2019, it was simply Smith picking up <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/13/steve-smith-england-australia-ashes">where he left off.</a> They saw Smith do exactly that to the tune of 774 runs last time around, and any time your tally equals an ABC radio callsign you’re doing well. They can’t believe that Smith between that series and now returned to the realm of batting mortals. They can look at the numbers – 28 Tests, four centuries – but they can’t quite believe what they weren’t there to see.</p><p>It was striking how much Smith’s hundred at the Oval resembled those from his last visit to England. There was the same bloodymindedness, a fully embodied determination that he was not going to accept anything less from his time in the middle. There was that scoring strike rate that spent most of the first day in the 30s before finally nudging up to 41. There were the 19 boundaries, only half a dozen of which went through the off-side between mid-off and point. Above all, there was a return to the technique that worked so well last time.<br /><br />During the interim, Smith had changed up, taking guard more centrally in front of the stumps and staying more still at the crease while waiting for the bowler to arrive. It worked for him in Sri Lanka in 2022, with his unbeaten 145 in Galle. That innings felt significant. For a six-year span between 2013 and 2019, he made 26 hundreds. After Manchester 2019, it was one century in nearly three years, a pandemic notwithstanding. Then came Galle, and soon afterwards a century against South Africa and a double against West Indies.<br /><br />For those last three Smith used the new technique, where he tried to stay more side-on to the ball and not to move. Part of his explanation was that it kept his body to the leg-side of the ball, opening up the off-side so he could score more aggressively through cover. Especially against the generally faster pace of South Africa, that helped his scoring options. And with less movement off the surface in Australia, it was a safe method as well.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/08/cricket-england-australia-ashes-steve-smith-batting-immortal">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The candidates proliferate – but Donald Trump, running both as former president and insurgent, is far ahead of them</p><p>Donald Trump has an excess of companions in the race for the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/04/republican-presidential-primary-revs-up-with-bikers-bbqs-and-a-donald-trump-shaped-hole" title="">Republican </a>nomination for 2024, but a paucity of rivals. The quantity of candidates in the presidential primary so far appears in inverse relationship to the threat they pose to him. The main question prompted by several recent declarees is not how they might win or what they might offer, but simply “why?” (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/07/mike-pence-2024-candidate-trump-analysis" title="">Mike Pence</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/06/chris-christie-announces-2024-presidential-run" title="">Chris Christie</a>), or even “who?” (<a href="https://apnews.com/article/perry-johnson-2024-presidential-campaign-b734b469aa0b56a94e19ef0125cf5997" title="">Perry Johnson</a>).</p><p>No one can predict what will happen in this race, and upsets do happen. Large fields and long shots positioning politicians for a future bid or the vice-presidential slot on the ticket are nothing new in primaries. Nor are improbable, often self-funded entrants. But the current flurry of activity – Mr Pence, former New Jersey governor Mr Christie and North Dakota’s governor <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/07/north-dakota-governor-doug-burgum-republican-race" title="">Doug Burgum</a> all announced runs this week – seems to be prompted less by the belief that Mr Trump is beatable than by the belief that Ron DeSantis isn’t the man to beat him. The Florida governor surged in polls after winning by a landslide in the midterms, while Trump-backed candidates fell short. It did not last.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/08/the-guardian-view-on-the-republican-primary-leader-of-the-unappetising-pack">Continue reading...</a>

## Webern: String Quartets; Bach: The Art of Fugue review | Andrew Clements's classical album of the week

<p><strong>Richter Ensemble<br />(Passacaille)<br /></strong>The pairing of Bach’s unfinished composition with Webern’s spare pieces for string quartet works well, although background noise takes the shine off</p><p>The three works for string quartet by <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Anton-Webern">Anton Webern</a> that were published in his lifetime – the Five Movements Op 5, Six Bagatelles Op 9, and the Op 28 String Quartet – add up to less than 25 minutes’ music, short measure for a recording. Finding a complement for these elusive, drastically compressed pieces is tricky – alongside them, the string quartets by his teacher Schoenberg, for instance, seem positively indulgent and overblown. So the Richter Ensemble has opted for a work that is equally spare and even more enigmatic, Bach’s The Art of Fugue.</p><p>There is no definitive version of The Art of Fugue; Bach seems to have composed it over the last 10 years of life to satisfy himself, not envisaging performances or specifying what instruments it might be performed by (though the layout of the music does suggest that it was conceived for a harpsichord), and adding pieces and reordering their sequence before the score was published. The Richter Ensemble opt to play 16 movements, varying the instrumentation for some of them by adding a violone and a harpsichord to the basic string quartet, who play on gut strings at baroque pitch, and interleaving them in groups between the Webern works, which are included chronologically. Their sequence ends with Bach’s final number, Contrapunctus XIV, which may have been intended as a quadruple fugue but which remained unfinished at his death; they present it exactly as Bach left it, breaking off mid-phrase.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/08/webern-string-quartets-bach-the-art-of-fugue-review-passacaille">Continue reading...</a>

Or you could call it the postcolonial predations of Big Food and Big Sugar.</p><p>Barbados, like other small island developing states, is fighting for its people’s survival. On this beautiful island, people wander daily into danger, swinging two-litre flasks of sugary drinks such as Coca-Cola as they step out of their cars, buying local fast food from the back of a van for lunch and queueing at Kentucky Fried Chicken or the local chain Chefette in the evening. The blessings of the modern convenience world have been visited upon small islands, with the result that more than half their people are dying prematurely from heart and lung conditions, cancer, diabetes and other non-communicable diseases.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/jun/08/barbados-fights-big-sugar-for-survival-of-its-people-diabetes">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In her debut novel, the San Franciscan author explores whether it’s possible for a Black liberal and a white conservative to be happily in love</p><p>Love your enemies, exhorts the Bible; those who preach the doctrine, Nietzsche said, are “sweating while they do it”. The San Francisco-based data scientist turned novelist Cecilia Rabess somewhat agrees. Everything’s Fine, her much-hyped debut, is a blistering study of what it means to date your political opposite.</p><p>The novel opens on Jess’s first day of work at Goldman Sachs in New York City. There she meets Josh, an analyst who is a previous classmate. Jess is Black and liberal; Josh is white and conservative. At the Ivy League college they went to, they had clashed on everything from affirmative action to Obama (they were in their freshman year when Obama was first elected president). Now, a year after their graduation, Josh is Jess’s mentor and a “rising star” while Jess is struggling to learn the ropes and is despised by their managing director.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/08/everythings-fine-by-cecilia-rabess-review-assured-mixed-race-mixed-politics-romance">Continue reading...</a>

They plan to marry</p><p>Spending the summer of 2020 recovering from severe Covid-19 wasn’t something that Adelina had expected to be doing in her late 30s. Before the illness, she ran a tech consulting business and had a busy life. “The virus left me unable to breathe and I was hospitalised in March. That led to the breakdown of my previous relationship,” she says. In an effort to regain her health, Adelina started walking and getting fitter near where she lived in Cambridge. She joined a dating app in November, writing on her profile that she liked nature and had “just about died from Covid” a few months before.</p><p>Alan, who lived in Milton Keynes, responded. “I said it was a bit of an abrupt change in tone from talking about nature walks and asked how she was doing now,” he says.

## Nikola Jokić is making the NBA finals a showcase of his inimitable brilliance

<p>As the Nuggets tighten their grip on the NBA finals, the staggering performances conjured by their singular star are making a convincing claim for historical greatness</p><p>Hybridity has always been in Nikola Jokić’s basketball DNA; after all, this is a player who was famously drafted by Denver <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fQc0hirB-o">in the middle of a Taco Bell commercial</a> for the quesadilla-burrito mashup known as a <em>quesarito</em>. The pretty, historic town of Sombor, where Jokić grew up, is tucked into the northwestern pocket of Serbia, flush against the borders with Croatia and Hungary; the Hungarian, Habsburg, Ottoman and Austrian empires have all, at various points over the past half-millennium, laid claim to it. Jokić, perhaps fittingly given his origins, has emerged over this postseason as the NBA’s ultimate border-hopper: a center with the touch of a guard, a prodigious scorer who’s better as a passer, the embodiment of total basketball, infinitely adaptable, positionless but always in position, a crossroads in human form.</p><p>As Denver tightened their grip on the finals with a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/07/denver-nuggets-miami-heat-nba-finals-game-3-report">coolly commanding Game 3 win</a> in Miami on Wednesday night, a talent that once threatened to go unrewarded with the hard currency of titles has come thrillingly into mint. Jokić’s numbers last night – 32 points, 21 rebounds, 10 assists – made him the first player ever to post a 30-20-10 game in the NBA finals. But most impressive was the way in which he accumulated these figures, with a freedom and variety that captured the best of his childhood heroes. Growing up in Serbia in the early years of this century, Jokić would spend hours on YouTube watching his favorite NBA players. “I watched Magic because of his passing, and Hakeem because of his post moves, and Jordan because he is Jordan,” Jokic <a href="https://www.theplayerstribune.com/articles/nikola-jokic-nuggets-serbia-basketball">wrote</a> in 2016, a year after joining the Denver Nuggets as a second-round draft pick. The two-time MVP is clomping through these finals with the vision and improvisational sizzle of Magic, Hakeem the Dream’s size-defying touch and footwork, and Jordan’s on-court omnipresence and invincibility, his sheer weight of numbers and aura of statistical destiny. A claim for historical greatness is convincingly being assembled.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jun/08/nikola-jokic-nba-finals-denver-nuggets">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Former agent has recruited several Premier League players and is targeting more in mission to take the club to the big time</p><p>As Turkey awaits the Champions League final, one of its most famous clubs is aiming to plot a course that will enable them to compete for major European honours. On Wednesday Besiktas finished the season third, 10 points behind the champions, Galatasaray, a big jump from sixth the previous year, their lowest position in more than two decades. The sporting director, Ceyhun Kazanci, is in charge of mapping the Black Eagles’ route back to the top and he is taking inspiration from the Premier League.</p><p>Last summer six players arrived from England: Nathan Redmond, Wout Weghorst, Romain Saïss, Arthur Masuaku, Cenk Tosun and, most notably, Dele Alli. Kazanci believes the Turkish league requires greater physicality and speed. “One of the missing things in Turkey was intensity on the pitch,” he says. “That is why I was focused on Premier League teams.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/08/besiktas-ceyhun-kazanci-a-turkish-team-can-win-a-european-cup-again">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Green party’s former leader and only MP to stand down after saying she ‘struggled’ to spend enough time campaigning on climate crisis</p><p>Good morning. Tony Benn famously said, when he stood down as an MP, that he was leaving the House of Commons so that he would have “more time to devote to politics”. This morning <strong>Caroline Lucas</strong>, Britain’s first Green party MP, has in effect announced she is doing the same. <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/full-list-the-mps-standing-down-at-the-next-election/">More than 50 MPs</a> have said they are standing down at the next election, but Lucas is one of the most significant figures on the list. Lucas’s election, as MP for Brighton Pavilion, was a major boost to the Green party (which she has twice led) and to the environemntal cause generally.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.carolinelucas.com/caroline/parliament/letter/my-open-letter-to-constituents-in-brighton-pavilion">an open letter to her constituents</a>, she highlights some of the progress made on green, and other, issues over the past 13 years. Explaining her decision to stand down, she says:</p><p>The intensity of these constituency commitments, together with the particular responsibilities of being my party’s sole MP, mean that, ironically, I’ve not been able to focus as much as I would like on the existential challenges that drive me – the nature and climate emergencies. I have always been a different kind of politician – as those who witnessed my arrest, court case and acquittal over peaceful protest at the fracking site in Balcombe nearly ten years ago will recall. And the truth is, as these threats to our precious planet become ever more urgent, I have struggled to spend the time I want on these accelerating crises. I have therefore decided not to stand again as your MP at the next election.</p><p>The reason I came into politics was to change things. Thirteen years ago it’s inconceivable that parliament would have declared a climate emergency. And I’ve put issues like a universal basic income and a legal right to access nature on the political agenda; secured the first parliamentary debate in a generation on drug law reform; and thanks to my work in parliament, a natural history GCSE will soon be on the syllabus. I have said the previously unsayable, only to see it become part of the mainstream, on coal, on the myth that endless economic growth makes us happier, on a green new deal.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2023/jun/08/rishi-sunak-joe-biden-washington-white-house-caroline-lucas-latest-politics-updates">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From ‘proactive aggression’ to our ‘predilection’ for polygamy, an engaging study of the traits that have influenced civilisation  </p><p>I blame <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/yuval-noah-harari">Yuval Noah Harari</a>. Since the Israeli historian’s bestselling <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/11/sapiens-brief-history-humankind-yuval-noah-harari-review" title="">Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</a> in 2011, there has been a trend for thick tomes proposing to explain our humanity through one or other lens across deep time. Just this year, we have had books about how human history was shaped by epidemic disease (Jonathan Kennedy’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/06/pathogenesis-by-jonathan-kennedy-review-in-sickness-and-in-health" title="">Pathogenesis</a>), or by climate variation (Peter Frankopan’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/02/the-earth-transformed-by-peter-frankopan-review-history-through-a-different-lens" title="">The Earth Transformed</a>).

Are there any surprising angles left?</p><p>Despite the relentless news of war and mass murder, for one thing, it is good for someone to remind us – as Sverker Johansson also did in his The Dawn of Language – that we are actually unusually peaceful, for apes. (Even free-loving bonobos are much more physically violent to one another.) In Dartnell’s intriguing opening argument, our prehistoric forebears suppressed reactive aggression in favour of “planned proactive aggression”, used only to punish norm-violators, and so constructed a civilisation built on amazing levels of cooperation and reciprocity.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/08/being-human-by-lewis-dartnell-review-how-our-biology-shaped-history">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From You Hurt My Feelings to Platonic, our screens are now full of middle-aged relationships built on little white lies</p><p>The premise of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/may/27/you-hurt-my-feelings-movie-writing">You Hurt My Feelings</a>, a new movie by Nicole Holofcener starring Julia Louis-Dreyfus, is deceptively simple: to what degree, when asked for your opinion by a spouse or equivalent, do you tell them the truth? Louis-Dreyfus plays Beth, a writer whose husband, Don (Tobias Menzies), is her primary cheerleader until she overhears him expressing negative opinions about her new book. Anyone who has ever produced anything at all will die at the accuracy of this scene and identify with Beth’s instinct to throw up in the nearest bin. The movie asks if the husband has been right to conceal his true feelings, and if she is right to react as she does.</p><p>The cleverness of the set-up is in how endlessly applicable it is and how disproportionate the feelings are that these kinds of incidents trigger. Most of us have been on both sides of this equation, struggling to find the right answer when a partner asks: “How do I look in this?”, and also trying to temper our own neediness when asking (pleading) for similar reassurances. As Don discovers, there is often no winning: overpraise may be rejected as rote and therefore worthless, but anything that tips even close to frank criticism risks triggering a rage spiral. Meanwhile, as he points out in defensive frustration, the world is going to hell in a handcart and this is what she freaks out about?</p><p>Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/08/partner-truth-film-tv-you-hurt-my-feelings-platonic">Continue reading...</a>
