Disney has been rampaging through their list of classic animated films and remaking them with a blend of live-action and CGI. The next on the list is The Little Mermaid! Because they WILL do to every animated movie theyâ€™ve ever released. They will.

The Little Mermaid definitely raises some questions. Like why do all the creatures have to look so real? Why is Flounder scary? If Ursula can just lie and cheat, why even bother with a deal? Did Eric actually fall in love or was he just under the spell of the Siren call? How many of these remakes are left?

To answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to The Little Mermaid!
