(Purchasers of 2013\u2019s The Electric Lady could take their pick from the standard edition, featuring a cover titled Concerning Cindi and Her Sisters and the Skull of Night Thrashings, or a deluxe version called Concerning Cindi and the Glow of the Drogon\u2019s Eyes.) Equal parts Afrofuturism and the sexually ambiguous personae of 70s Bowie, Mon\u00e1e\u2019s albums to date posited her as a part-human, part-cyborg figure in a dystopian future. And you couldn\u2019t fault Mon\u00e1e\u2019s sense of commitment to her roles, which extended to apparently giving interviews in character. But the records sold well rather than spectacularly, spawning hits that slow-burned to gold status without actually making the Top 40.</p><p>On her fourth album, however, everything has changed. The high concepts and Afrofuturism appear to have gone out of the window. Rather than a stylised illustration of a heavily coiffed and costumed Mon\u00e1e complete with a wordy subtitle, the cover of The Age of Pleasure features a blurry snap of the singer topless and underwater, swimming through a succession of people\u2019s legs. It clocks in at a trim 31 minutes, less than half the length of either The Electric Lady or The ArchAndroid, and its songs, interludes and fleeting guest appearances \u2013 Grace Jones speaking French; a brief burst of toasting from venerable Jamaican DJ Sister Nancy \u2013 segue into each other. And its lyrical focus shifts dramatically from future dystopias to partying and having it off. There are songs named after champagne cocktails, and recordings of Mon\u00e1e and friends toasting each other as they embark on an evening of bar-hopping. It takes 90 seconds for her to mention Japanese rope bondage and that\u2019s the tone pretty much set: homemade porn, threesomes, demands to \u201cfeel a little tongue\u201d, a song apparently about wanking that opens with the attention-grabbing line: \u201cIf I could fuck me right here, right now, I would.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/08/janelle-monae-the-age-of-pleasure-review-wondaland-bad-boy\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/08/janelle-monae-the-age-of-pleasure-review-wondaland-bad-boy", "date_published": "2023-06-08 13:00:31+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Simone Inzaghi has chance to confirm title as King of the Cups with Inter", "description": "<p>Coach has form in knockout games and is ready for Champions League final against \u2018the best team in the world\u2019</p><p>The bar for success has always been set impossibly high for Simone Inzaghi.

These six large-scale paintings are created in response to the works in Glyndebourne\u2019s current season and are on display at the festival</p><p>My Viennese stepfather introduced me to opera via his newly acquired cassette player in the very early 1970s. We listened to The Magic Flute and marvelled at the Queen of the Night. I imagined what she might look like and found immense pleasure conjuring the forest, the beasts and the endless tasks in my head. From then onwards I began to be interested in this magic art multi-layered form. At art school, studying theatre design, operas were almost always given to us to complete as our monthly assignments. I listened to and learned very quickly to love them, though my skills in design never really blossomed in the direction or to the degree that the tutors had dreamed of. The Magic Flute, Norma, Dido and Aeneus, The Rake\u2019s Progress, Don Pasquale, Rigoletto, Fidelio and, of course, Der Rosenkavalier have stayed with me for decades, floating in and out of my studios, my bathrooms and bedrooms on vinyl, cassette, compact disc and car radios. These performances were almost always experienced privately and not in public at the opera house.</p><p>When I began the paintings for Glyndebourne, I thought about the immense, multi-coloured sounds and at the same time the broken, seductive, powerful and sometimes hilarious human bodies. On the canvases you can find delicate hands, straining penises, disconnected hearts, floating brains, severed necks and pursed lips. Through this work, I embarked on the next stage of my adventure to find out what love actually sounds like.</p><p>Don Giovanni (2023) \u00a9 Lubaina Himid.

On one level, it is a love story, or rather a story about the loss of love. It begins with a woman, Katharina, hearing about the death of her former lover. Boxes of his papers are delivered to her apartment, and when she finally sits down to open them the past rises before her like a pack of playing cards thrown into the air.</p><p>The book then moves back to their first meeting, tracing step by step the contours of a relationship that is not only intellectually and emotionally complicated in itself, but whose difficulties are compounded through its relationship to the collapse of East Germany. Katharina and Hans meet in East Berlin in 1986, and they live out the disintegration of all their hopes and dreams, personally and politically, throughout the course of the novel.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/08/kairos-by-jenny-erpenbeck-review-a-monumental-breakup\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/08/kairos-by-jenny-erpenbeck-review-a-monumental-breakup", "date_published": "2023-06-08 06:30:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Green party MP Caroline Lucas to stand down at next election", "description": "<p>Former leader says her role in parliament means she has struggled to focus on tackling climate issues</p><p>Caroline Lucas, the Green party\u2019s former leader and its only MP, has announced she is to stand down at the next election.</p><p>Lucas told her constituents in Brighton Pavilion, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/07/green-party-caroline-lucas-mp\">a seat she has represented since 2010</a>, that serving as an MP meant she had \u201cstruggled\u201d to spend the time she wanted campaigning on the climate crisis.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/08/green-party-mp-caroline-lucas-to-stand-down-at-next-election--brighton-pavilion-\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/08/green-party-mp-caroline-lucas-to-stand-down-at-next-election--brighton-pavilion-", "date_published": "2023-06-08 06:18:39+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "\u2018Only 11 other people have completed it\u2019: cycling the 7,600km European Divide", "description": "<p>From the Norwegian fjords to the mountains of Portugal, this epic bikepacking adventure through nine countries has beauty \u2013 and challenges \u2013 in spades</p><p>Last summer I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/cyclingholidays\">cycled</a> 7,600km (4,722 miles) along a route called <a href=\"https://europeandividetrail.com/\">the European Divide Trail</a>, which runs through nine countries, all the way from Arctic Norway to the Atlantic coast in Portugal, mostly camping out along the way.
