## Show HN: Visibly – More Collaborative and Efficient Code Reviews on GitHub

<p>Hey HN! I’m Nick, the founder of Visibly (<a href="https://visibly.dev" rel="nofollow">https://visibly.dev</a>). Visibly is a GitHub App and Chrome extension that makes code review more efficient, collaborative, and visible by enabling you to:<p>- See review comment thread statuses so that you can quickly address each thread and focus your attention on the ones that actually require it<p>- Indicate whether feedback is blocking or non-blocking so only crucial feedback blocks PR merge<p>- Ensure all blocking review threads are addressed before merge via a status check<p>- Track total active review time per reviewer so that you can understand the effort and review time going into each PR<p>- See reviewer presence so that you can see if someone is already reviewing and avoid unnecessary pings.<p>In addition to these workflow improvements, Visibly provides a personalized metrics dashboard so you can understand your real-time performance and better advocate for yourself and advance your career.<p>You can see a demo and a breakdown of all of the current features at <a href="https://visibly.dev" rel="nofollow">https://visibly.dev</a>.<p>I created Visibly after seeing the same pain points across Microsoft, Snap, Headspace, and Brex:<p>- Code review was frequently undervalued and invisible. Developers recognized this and prioritized code production instead, which resulted in knowledge silos, poor code quality, and a culture of rubber stamp reviews.<p>- Engineering performance review was broken. From the manager’s perspective, it was difficult to identify top performers and to provide timely, actionable feedback. From the IC’s perspective, feedback was infrequent and subjective around many aspects of the job. The process was also time-consuming and required everyone to sift through 3-6 months of work to quantify “impact and scope”.<p>Visibly solves these issues by using objective measures to make code review more visible and efficient.<p>Visibly values privacy and security above all else; it does not require source code access and requests the fewest possible permissions to provide these experiences. Visibly is also differentiated in its belief that individuals should know how they’re doing and have personalized metrics so that they can advance in their careers.<p>If you use GitHub, you can try Visibly today for free by heading to <a href="https://visibly.dev/login" rel="nofollow">https://visibly.dev/login</a>. Visibly is currently free, but we plan to introduce paid features and pricing plans soon. Our pricing is still under development, but based on existing customer feedback, we expect to price at $20/seat/month. For those that sign up over the next week, we plan to provide 50% off for the first year once our pricing plans launch.<p>We look forward to your thoughts and feedback!</p>

## Ask HN: What is the most cost effective way to do backups?

<p>I'm interesting in backing up some large VM images, say about 500 GB.<p>I want to optimize for lowest cost.<p>I would prefer to use a tool like rsync (and not an inflexible closed source GUI). So, things like Box don't appeal to me.<p>I'm doing this in case of catastrophic failure to my HD. It is a risk, of course, but I would prefer to pay less for a service that might "only be 90%" as reliable. I don't need 5 9s.<p>I see a variety of services, the best of which seem to be rsync.net which is priced at minimum of 700 GB for 1.5 cents a GB, so about $15/mo (https://www.rsync.net/pricing.html)<p>I could run my own VM on Vultr and can't do better than that AFAICT.<p>I see services like pCloud which have a *lifetime* cost of $199 for 500B (https://www.pcloud.com/cloud-storage-pricing-plans.html?period=lifetime). That seems interesting, and I expect in five years they will say "Sorry, we are out of business!" I'm ok with that risk and will likely plan for that.<p>But, are there other options to consider? Is there a sweet spot for storage if I almost never need to put more files, can tolerate slow retrieval, and am OK with a discount because the company will probably go out of business?<p>I could just buy a used desktop off Craigslist with a 1TB drive for $200 and pay for the power myself. That's another option, but I wonder if there is some reason I can find a cheaper option.</p>

## Launch HN: Infield (YC W20) – Safer, faster dependency upgrades
 - [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36242125](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36242125)

<p>Hi HN, we’re Steve, Allison, and Andy, founders of Infield (<a href="https://infield.ai">https://infield.ai</a>). Infield makes it clear which open source dependencies you should upgrade next, and how to do so safely. We do this by using a LLM to read every changelog.<p>Here’s a short demo video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diCGmtMUeRU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diCGmtMUeRU</a><p>We’re launching today with support for Ruby packages. If you’ve ever run `bundle outdated` or upgraded a Rails app, Infield is for you. You can try it on your own project at <a href="https://app.infield.ai/hn">https://app.infield.ai/hn</a>. Upload your Gemfile and Gemfile.lock (no email/name/cc required) and we’ll show you Infield on your code.<p>I (Steve) have been building open source software and commercial web apps for more than a decade. I spent the last year personally upgrading Rails apps by hand for companies in order to research this problem. I'm convinced that every company is re-inventing the wheel and doing by hand a bunch of toilsome work that can be done with software.<p>As one example, I was working as a consultant upgrading an app to Rails 7. This company was using the attr_encrypted gem to encrypt information at the database level. Rails 7 brings built-in support for encryption in a way that's incompatible with this gem. Having hit this same problem at two other companies I already knew how to handle the migration; but if I hadn’t, they could have risked their most sensitive customer data (this is what you tend to encrypt). After that project I started building a personal database of "upgrade experiences" and before long felt sure we could make useful software.<p>The time-consuming part of package upgrades is not coding—it’s mostly risk assessment, research, and project planning. If I’m on a maintenance rotation and have half a day to pay down some technical debt, which package upgrades should I look at? I might end up spending that time trying to upgrade something only to get blocked and give up. Worse, many breaking changes are subtle and won’t be caught by CI. I’ve brought down production only to find an issue was buried in a changelog I didn’t read!<p>Infield scans all of your dependencies to prioritize upgrades based on effort (how much work is this? Is it risky?) and impact (will upgrading fix a security issue? will it get me onto a supported branch?). We can do this because we use GPT to read the changelog for every package you rely on. Changelogs are broken apart into discrete changes and classified according to the keepachangelog.com standard. Then a human expert reviews the output. We can spend more time researching each package than you because we’re going to re-use this work for every future customer doing the same upgrade.<p>Sometimes you want to do a complex upgrade like Rails that might be blocked on other packages being upgraded first. For this case we run an optimization based on the PubGrub
algorithm to solve for a suggested target version of all your dependencies that will be compatible with the next version of Rails. We group and order these blockers into an "Upgrade path" you can follow.<p>Most of the existing work in this space is security monitoring software like Dependabot or Snyk. These tools are primarily sold to security teams to let you know about CVEs that affect your dependencies. They’re reactive, a way to let developers know when they need to upgrade something but not how to do it. Our goal with Infield is to make it so easy to keep dependencies up to date that you’re always on the latest versions.<p>Infield is $60/mo/repo and we’re launching today with support for Ruby. Javascript and Python are probably next, but we’re very interested to hear which language you feel this pain in most acutely. Ruby is first since the consolidation around Rails allows us to really nail the experience for a focused set of packages.<p>You can try Infield on your own codebase at <a href="https://app.infield.ai/hn">https://app.infield.ai/hn</a>. With the paid plan we’ll hook into your codebase to continuously scan your dependencies as you merge PRs. That works via a Github app, or you can use our CLI tool to send us just the files we need as part of your CI pipeline.<p>Please give it a try and comments are welcome! We’d love to hear everything you hate (or love, or just think) about dependency management and how we can make it better!</p>

<p>Hello Hackers,<p>I built this webapp over a weekend and launched on May 11 to help (also to impress) my cousins and friends who were obsessed with high paying jobs. As a matter of fact they look for high paying jobs everyday.<p>Currently, a few thousand websites(including YC Jobs) are crawled to find high paying jobs. That number will go way up in the coming months.<p>Remarks and suggestions are most welcome.<p>Thanks</p>
