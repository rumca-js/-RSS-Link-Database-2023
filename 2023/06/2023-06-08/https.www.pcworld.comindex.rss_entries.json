But if the lack of support and security updates haven&rsquo;t compelled you to upgrade, Google&rsquo;s now increasing the pressure to get on to a modern OS: Come this summer, it&rsquo;s discontinuing support for its Windows 8 and 8.1 Google Drive apps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As reported by <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.androidpolice.com/google-drive-dropping-support-windows-8/&amp;xcust=2-3-1946991-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Android Police</a>, a Google Drive <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.google.com/a/answer/7577057&amp;xcust=2-3-1946991-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">support page</a> warns users to upgrade to Windows 10 for uninterrupted service&mdash;and specifically the 64-bit version, as the company is also dropping support for 32-bit Windows 10 systems. While web access to Drive will still be available, sync will stop working in August.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dropping support for dead versions of Windows isn&rsquo;t new for Google, which started this push with Chrome back in February. Other companies are making similar moves, with Mozilla also ending <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1940069/mozilla-ends-firefox-support-for-windows-7-8-old-macs.html\">Firefox support for Windows 7, 8, and 8.1</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/427723/how-to-upgrade-to-windows-10-what-you-need-to-know.html\">Upgrading to Windows 10</a> should be straightforward&mdash;and if you already have a licensed copy, won&rsquo;t cost you anything. (If for some reason you don&rsquo;t, try one of our tips for getting <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/397575/how-to-get-windows-cheap-or-even-for-free.html\">a cheap license key</a>.) Just be sure to <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/426736/3-easy-steps-anyone-can-take-now-to-back-up-a-pc.html\">back up your PC</a> before beginning the conversion.

Meanwhile, if you&rsquo;re moving from 32-bit to 64-bit Windows, having backups is absolutely necessary. You unfortunately can&rsquo;t make the jump without a complete wipe and fresh operating system install.</p>\n\nInternet, Storage</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1946991/1946991.html", "date_published": "2023-06-08 18:17:24+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Chrome adds Windows biometric logins to its password powers", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Google has made major improvements to how passwords are stored inside Chrome, taking some of its best features from its mobile browser and applying them to the desktop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There has always been some tension between the browser and <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407092/best-password-managers-reviews-and-buying-advice.html\">password managers</a> in terms of which app holds the keys to your digital life. Google already offers to <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/402550/google-chrome-new-password-manager.html\">store your passwords within the Google cloud</a>, offering additional features such as trolling the deep web to ensure that they haven&rsquo;t been leaked as part of a breach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today Google and Chrome add some new key features: a quick shortcut to your passwords from the desktop, the ability to import passwords stored elsewhere, and, perhaps most importantly, the ability to use biometric identification to unlock your password vault on the desktop browser. You&rsquo;ll also be able to add notes to a password file, to identify a PIN or store other useful information. The note will also be securely stored, with the same protections applied to the password. Password Checkup is also coming to iOS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biometric authentication is probably the most important update. On mobile, that generally means using a fingerprint scanner to unlock the password vault or identify yourself to an app. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the desktop, Google will use whatever biometric methods are available to your PC &mdash; Windows Hello depth cameras, typically. (If you don&rsquo;t own a <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/394379/windows-hello-webcams-you-can-buy-right-now.html\">Windows Hello webcam</a>, you can buy one &mdash; they&rsquo;re more available and much cheaper than they were a couple years ago.) This is an optional feature, but provides a powerful layer of security that takes little effort. Anecdotally, facial logins via Windows Hello can &ldquo;degrade&rdquo; over time as you shave or grow a beard, for example. However, if Windows Hello works for Windows, it will work for Chrome.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Google chrome password notes\" class=\"wp-image-1946963\" height=\"1196\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Google-Chrome-password-notes.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Here&rsquo;s what the password notes within Google will look like.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Google</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Google has also added a &ldquo;home&rdquo; for managing passwords within Chrome, via the new &ldquo;Password Manager&rdquo; heading in your Chrome settings menu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&rsquo;ll probably welcome the ability to add notes to your passwords, too. In most cases a site will simply ask for a username and password, but there may be cases where the site itself undergoes a revamp, or a username shifts, or any number of reasons where a note to yourself will clear up any lingering confusion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Naturally, Google and Android are inseparable. But Google added that it&rsquo;s bringing its Password Checkup tool to iOS, too. If you&rsquo;ve reused any passwords on your iPhone, or if they&rsquo;ve been breached, Google Chrome on iOS will alert you to change your password. Google already added password autofill on iOS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one feature that we&rsquo;d question is the ability to import passwords from other password managers. Chrome now allows you to do that by downloading those passwords as a CSV file, which sounds implicitly unsafe. Another weakness is that while you can import passwords to Chrome, Chrome is only a web browser. A password manager syncs your passwords across apps and services; Chrome doesn&rsquo;t. If you store your passwords within Chrome or Edge, that&rsquo;s where they&rsquo;ll stay. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\nPersonal Software, Security</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1946946/chrome-adds-windows-biometric-logins-to-its-password-powers.html", "date_published": "2023-06-08 17:41:54+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Best webcams 2023: Top picks and expert buying advice", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Probably no other hardware category has seen such rapid improvements as webcams, thanks to the work-from-home zeitgeist spurred on by the pandemic. Manufacturers now realize that 1080p resolution, proper lighting, and improved audio are quickly becoming basic requirements. Premium options often go far beyond.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, most laptops <em>still</em> ship with a 720p webcam, so a 1080p webcam can be a step up&mdash;what better way to stand out from the pack on your next Teams call? There are even premium models with integrated ring lights for a few dollars more. Other, more expensive options feature 4K resolution or higher refresh rates, which will make a noticeable difference to both you, your friends, and your colleagues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We haven&rsquo;t tested every one of these webcams, but we&rsquo;ve selected out the best webcams based on specs and bundled extras, including our own reviews. You can also refer to our separate story on the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/394379/windows-hello-webcams-you-can-buy-right-now.html\">best Windows Hello webcams</a> to buy a webcam for videoconferencing and to log you in to your PC. We&rsquo;ve taken two recommendations from that list, however, and added them here: a premium and budget webcam with Windows Hello. You might be surprised to see one recommended as a best webcam, period &mdash; because it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help you choose, check out our buying advice below our recommendations.

First off, Anker&rsquo;s PowerConf C200 provides an upgraded 1440p resolution, better than 1080p to make you look clearer and more professional. Second, this webcam offers an adjustable field of view (65, 78, and 95 degrees) meaning that you can manually crop out portions of the background you don&rsquo;t want to be visible.</p>\n\n<p>For some reason, Amazon markets this as a &ldquo;Mac&rdquo; webcam. Anker provides Windows drivers, so you don&rsquo;t need to worry about that. However, you <em>will</em> need Anker&rsquo;s software to take full advantage of all the webcam&rsquo;s features&mdash;e.g, though the USB-A cable makes this a plug-and-play device, the software is necessary to adjust the field-of-view function.</p>\n\n<p>The PowerConf C200 includes noise-cancelling mics and an integrated privacy shutter, which turns off the whole device&mdash;a plus, if you&rsquo;re concerned about a bad guy somehow hacking your mic and listening to your conversations with your family, boss, and pets.

Logitech describes the C920e as a business camera, and the C920s as the consumer version&mdash;they&rsquo;re otherwise identical, save that the C920e has a three-year warranty versus a two-year warranty, while costing the same. The C920e reportedly offers lighting and color controls that the C920s does not, as well.</p>\n\n<p>Both cameras use a narrower 78.5-degree viewing angle, which focuses on your face better than webcams that use a 90-degree viewing angle. It&rsquo;s also an autofocus camera, which helps justify its higher price. The C920e connects to your laptop using a USB-A cable measuring 5 feet. </p>\n\n<p>Aside from a lack of 60fps support, this is still a great webcam. We prefer it, in fact, to Logitech&rsquo;s most recent webcam, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/webcams/brio-305-webcam.960-001414.html#buy-brio-305-webcam&amp;xcust=2-1-393756-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/393756/1080p-webcam-buying-guide.html\">Logitech Brio 305</a>, which is slightly more expensive and lacks the 1.2X zoom the C920e offers.</p>\n\n<p>A number of Asian companies are starting to match what the C920e offers on paper, but its superb video quality could be harder to mimic.

Our review of this webcam, below, points out its flaws: It tends to overexpose the user, even without the integrated ring light, and the mic quality is poor. The DIY privacy shutter is a little goofy but works fine.</p>\n\n<p>Honestly, if you&rsquo;re the kind of person who can look past a few quirks, there&rsquo;s a lot to like here. The 2K (1440p) / 30Hz resolution looks even sharper than a 1080p cam, for one. You will tend to look blown out a bit if you use and are lit by an external display. As a plain-Jane webcam that hooks onto your laptop screen, however, the white balance evens out just fine.  </p>\n\n<p>The mics are one of its irredeemable flaws, though. If your laptop has an integrated mic, you may find that it&rsquo;s better than what Monoprice&rsquo;s webcam offers.

But this webcam packs in the features. Inside is a 2K resolution camera, four-microphone array, speaker, and built-in light that also serves as a privacy guard&mdash;and you get a high level of control over all the hardware.</p>\n\n<p>Capacitive buttons on the device let you mute the mic, adjust the intensity of the light, and turn the light on and off. Though a bit fiddly, they work and solidly cover the basics. There&rsquo;s an LED light that indicates the mic&rsquo;s status, too.</p>\n\n<p>The companion AnkerWork app expands your settings. Choosing between viewing angles of 65, 78, and 95 degrees is fast, as is downscaling the default resolution from 2K to 1080p, 720p, or 360p. You can also tune the brightness, sharpness, saturation, and contrast of your video feed, alter the light bar&rsquo;s color temperature, and set the light&rsquo;s brightness to auto adjust based on ambient conditions.</p>\n\n<p>This webcam is an extremely nice all-in-one solution, so long as you&rsquo;re parked at a desk. (This video bar and its swiveling mount require a monitor for proper support.) The camera is clear and crisp, the speaker gets plenty loud, the mic holds its own against many laptops and earbuds, and the light is handy in dark rooms or for balancing out harsh backlighting. You can use the B600 as a speakerphone, too, eliminating problems with other callers hearing themselves as they speak.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"ad page-ad has-ad-prefix ad-article\"></div>\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-separator\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart-item product-chart-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper--title product-chart-title \" id=\"razer-kiyo-pro-ultra-best-premium-4k-webcam\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRazer Kiyo Pro Ultra &ndash; Best premium 4K webcam\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"large-pro-cons-product-chart-section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproduct-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper--large\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Razer Kiyo Pro Ultra - Best premium 4K webcam\" class=\"product-chart-item__image\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Razer-Kiyo-Pro-Ultra-product.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1500\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-columns\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t&lsquo;DSLR-quality&rsquo; imaging\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t4K options, HDR too\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tTerrific configurability\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tLens cap as well as a privacy shield\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tWhew, that price!\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tAverage mic quality\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tNo Windows Hello\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tLimited purchase options; just Razer.com for now\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__information \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"not-amp\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.razer.com/streaming-cameras/razer-kiyo-pro-ultra/RZ19-04420100-R3U1&amp;xcust=2-1-393756-6-1654618-10700&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$299.99 at  Razer</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>The Razer Kiyo Pro Ultra claims to offer DSLR-quality images, and boy, it comes pretty close!

HDR is also an option, though you&rsquo;ll probably prefer to turn off this option. The field-of-view varies between 72 degrees and 82 degrees, depending on the resolution. Manual pan and zoom are available, but you might wonder why the camera can&rsquo;t orient itself toward your face automatically. Otherwise, the Razer Synapse software offers an absolute ton of configurability.</p>\n\n<p>About the only thing that could stand to be improved is the mic&mdash;you may prefer using your laptop&rsquo;s mic instead. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1654613/razer-kiyo-pro-ultra-webcam-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRazer Kiyo Pro Ultra review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"ad page-ad has-ad-prefix ad-article\"></div>\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-separator\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart-item product-chart-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper--title product-chart-title \" id=\"logitech-brio-4k-best-premium-4k-webcam-runner-up\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLogitech Brio 4K &ndash;

In any event, this $65 or so webcam seems to offer what you&rsquo;ll need, plus Windows Hello functionality.</p>\n\n<p>Users have complained that you&rsquo;ll need to make sure Windows is up to date&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;that your webcam is directly plugged into your laptop. There&rsquo;s no privacy shutter, unfortunately.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"ad page-ad has-ad-prefix ad-article\"></div>\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-shop-for-a-webcam\">How to shop for a webcam</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A standalone 1080p webcam can&rsquo;t add Windows Hello to your system, but it can greatly improve how you look on your next Zoom call. Here&rsquo;s what to look for. You&rsquo;ll probably ask yourself: <em>Should I prioritize a 60fps webcam over an autofocusing webcam</em>?<em> What about 4K?</em> We&rsquo;d say that if you have to choose one, prioritize a 1080p webcam, <em>then</em> a higher refresh rate, <em>then</em> jump up to 4K. If you can get more than one feature, great! Unless you&rsquo;ll be moving about a lot, a fixed-focus webcam will do just fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that of the three major videoconferencing services (Microsoft Teams, Zoom, and Google Meet) only Teams will automatically scale up your video to 1080p if your network and your webcam support it. You can <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/prepare-network&amp;xcust=2-1-393756-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">enable 1080p video in Zoom</a> and (finally!) in <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/04/full-hd-in-google-meet-video-calls.html&amp;xcust=2-1-393756-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google Meet</a>, but they require some manual adjustment in the app&rsquo;s Settings menu. In other word, only Teams will automatically take advantage of a 1080 webcam. On the other hand, it&rsquo;s not unreasonable to imagine that all three services will eventually auto-scale video calls to take advantage of a 1080p camera, so it&rsquo;s not a bad investment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might not have thought about it, but consider, too, that looking like you&rsquo;re on television will subtly lend you authority. People gravitate toward celebrities, and a 4K, 60Hz webcam is basically what your TV offers. If you&rsquo;re an executive or making sales calls over Zoom or Teams, a premium webcam may give you an edge. That&rsquo;s why professional streamers use them, after all.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"adjustable-or-fixed-focus\">Adjustable or fixed focus</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about fixed-focus, as virtually all webcams have been pre-configured at a focal length that&rsquo;s about the distance between your face and your laptop or monitor. You&rsquo;ll need to account for this with tripods, however, or pay a little more for an autofocusing webcam. Autofocus webcams are handy for situations where you may be moving about the room, but beware distracting webcams that frequently refocus.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"higher-frame-rates\">Higher frame rates</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A standard webcam captures video at 30 frames per second, and will look &ldquo;normal.&rdquo; You&rsquo;ll notice the smoothness of a 60fps camera though, and so will people you&rsquo;re on a video call with. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"field-of-view-fov\">Field of view (FOV)&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The camera&rsquo;s field of view can vary. A 90-degree FOV helps people focus on you (and perhaps not the mess you&rsquo;ve hidden off to the side). A 110-degree or higher FOV works better for group shots, although distortion can become a problem the wider your FOV gets.&nbsp;A 65-degree FOV may be perfect if it&rsquo;s just you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think of a 90-degree FOV as one that would show two people seated side-by-side at what you would consider a &ldquo;standard&rdquo; distance from a webcam, or a foot or two. A 110-degree FOV can show three people, squeezed a bit close together. Keep in mind that many videoconferencing applications offer the option of virtual backgrounds, which eliminate visual clutter.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"privacy-shutter\">Privacy shutter </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>These devices are not a privacy threat, for the simple reason that they can be unplugged easily. Most have a flip-down privacy shutter, but you could always put tape over the camera or drape it with a dark cloth.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"ring-lights\">Ring lights </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, integrated ring lights are now a thing on premium webcams, and worth the money if lighting is a challenge for you. While the integrated light will certainly help with lighting, a big bright display in front of you can serve a similar function. You can also purchase a ring light separately.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"windows-hello\">Windows Hello </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You may have used Windows Hello with a fingerprint reader or another laptop. The camera simply &ldquo;recognizes&rdquo; you, logging you in. It&rsquo;s exceptionally convenient. We have a separate article on the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/394379/windows-hello-webcams-you-can-buy-right-now.html\">best Windows Hello webcams</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"tripod-bundle\">Tripod bundle </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With so many webcams on the market, manufacturers are trying hard to differentiate their products. The new trend is a small tripod, which gives you more options for mounting the camera. Not all webcams include this, Normally, however, you can simply clip the webcam to the top of a display or a laptop with its &ldquo;jaws&rdquo; clamp.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"ai\">AI </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s a potential wild card that may be attached to webcams in the future: artificial intelligence, specifically Windows Studio Effects. Right now, the current <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1357826/microsoft-surface-pro-9-5g-review-an-arm-tablet-worth-buying.html\">Surface Pro 9 (5G)</a> uses the AI capabilities in the Qualcomm Snapdragon processor to apply background blue, automatic panning effects, and more. (Our review discusses this.) Other laptops that use Intel Core and AMD Ryzen processors don&rsquo;t include AI capabilities&mdash;yet. Specific models in the 13th-gen mobile Core and AMD Ryzen 7000 Mobile series include some basic AI capabilities, and future processors in both families may offer AI capabilities and therefore Windows Studio Effects. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What this essentially means is that we&rsquo;d expect future webcams to pan and zoom automatically to keep you in the frame. Few do this today, however.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-block faq-block\"><h2 class=\"faq-block-title\" id=\"faq\"> FAQ </h2><hr class=\"block-horizotal-divider\" />\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">1.</span>\n<h3 id=\"do-you-need-wi-fi-for-a-webcam\">Do you need Wi-Fi for a webcam?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>Yes and no. These webcams all connect to your computer directly, via a USB port, and you can record video from them while offline.

USB webcams, featured here, connect via USB to a computer and require it to operate. USB webcams are most often those used for video chat or live streaming from your computer on websites such as Twitch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>IP webcams however, can connect directly to a network, router, or modem and do not require a computer at all in order to work. IP webcams are most often used as security cameras or for live feeds that upload directly to the cloud. Those are separate products, however, and not the same webcams we&rsquo;re talking about here.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">3.</span>\n<h3 id=\"how-do-i-connect-my-webcam-to-the-internet\">How do I connect my webcam to the internet?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>For USB webcams, it will be as simple as plugging the camera into your computer&rsquo;s USB port, downloading the firmware, and then connecting to the internet via your computer.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-inner-block faq-save-block\"><div class=\"faq-save-content\"><span class=\"faq-rank\">4.</span>\n<h3 id=\"what-software-do-i-need-to-connect-my-webcam\">What software do I need to connect my webcam?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip\">\n<p>Technically, most webcams are plug and play, so you should simply be able to connect them to your PC to get them to work. Many, however, require their own software utilities to be installed to take advantage of specific features and to facilitate automatic updates. To actually use your webcam in a conference call, however, you&rsquo;ll need to use Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, or another videoconferencing app. Make sure you enter the app&rsquo;s settings menu and select the webcam&rsquo;s camera and microphone to provide the audio and video for your call.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n\nBusiness, Camera Accessories, Cameras, Computer Accessories, Desktop PCs, Laptop Accessories</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/393756/1080p-4k-webcam-buying-guide.html", "date_published": "2023-06-08 16:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Dozens of popular Minecraft mods are infected with malware", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>If you or your children like to run mods on the Windows or Linux version of <em>Minecraft</em>, you might want to check those installation folders.

API systems automatically updated some of the mods immediately, some of which have millions of recorded downloads. Across CureseForge and Bukkit, at least 25 popular mods were infected over the last three weeks, including the extremely popular<em> Better Minecraft</em> multi-mod package. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hackers appear to have targeted individual mod developers&rsquo; accounts, not the distribution platforms themselves, so it&rsquo;s not as bad as it could be. Even so, it&rsquo;s possible that millions of <em>Minecraft </em>players have been delivered Java-based spyware by updating their mods. Scanning tools have been provided to check for potential infections and affected users are instructed to clean their computers (possibly requiring a full operating system reinstallation) and change the passwords on all connected accounts. The malware is known to search for bank account, email, and cryptocurrency logins. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Minecraft </em>players are advised to avoid downloading mods from CurseForge and Bukkit for the time being. As always, practice caution when downloading mods or any kind of software from third-party sources. </p>\n\nSecurity</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1946803/dozens-of-popular-minecraft-mods-infected-with-malware.html", "date_published": "2023-06-08 14:47:37+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Nab this luxurious Philips gaming headset for just $65", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to competitive gaming, a good gaming headset can make a world of difference difference.

If so, it&rsquo;s highly likely that your data has been sold. Data is a valuable business these days and companies can make a lot of money selling your info to data brokers and other interested parties. This uninvited spam is certainly annoying, but don&rsquo;t worry. Here we&rsquo;ll show you how to stay one step ahead of spam and untrustworthy websites. And even if you don&rsquo;t use Gmail, the following trick works with Outlook and iCloud as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-find-out-who-is-selling-your-data\">How to find out who is selling your data</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You might not know it yet, but your personal Gmail address has countless variations. By simply adding a &ldquo;+&rdquo; and a word or number in front of &ldquo;@gmail.com&rdquo; to your own mail address, you&rsquo;ll be able to change your address, but all email sent to this new variation will still land in your mailbox as you&rsquo;re used to. With this method, it&rsquo;s now extremely easy to trace how and by whom your data has been passed around. Sounds too good to be true? Honestly, it&rsquo;s really that simple, we&rsquo;ll explain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you register with an online service, shop, or other website, you have to enter your email address. With this trick, instead of using your original Gmail address, add a &ldquo;+&rdquo; and the name of the provider or website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for example, instead of &ldquo;dennis@gmail.com&rdquo;, you can log in with &ldquo;dennis+firma1@gmail.com&rdquo;. You&rsquo;ll continue to receive all emails from that provider or service to your normal mailbox, but you&rsquo;ll also be able to identify exactly to whom they may have passed your data to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if you&rsquo;ve registered with &ldquo;Firma1&rdquo; and shortly afterwards, you receive spam emails from company 2, company 3, and company 4 with whom you have neither registered nor heard of, you can easily identify the culprit. If you open one of these spam emails in your inbox, you&rsquo;ll see your mail address under &ldquo;To&rdquo;. If, in this case, it says &ldquo;dennis+firma1@gmail.com,&rdquo; then you know for sure that this service has sold your data to company 2, for example, which is now sending you spam messages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To easily solve this, just unsubscribe and delete these spam emails from your inbox.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"data-trading-is-not-forbidden-in-principle\">Data trading is not forbidden in principle</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, companies are allowed to sell certain data under strict conditions&mdash;email address trading is particularly popular. As a rule, you typically knowingly or unknowingly agree to your data being passed on to third parties by accepting the privacy policy of a service or website. Often users don&rsquo;t even know this because the notice is hidden somewhere in the statement and most users don&rsquo;t both reading it completely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The above trick is therefore particularly well suited to finding out which service passes on your address data to third parties&mdash;whether with or without your knowing consent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article was translated from German to English, and originally appeared on pcwelt.de.</em></p>\n\nInternet</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1936106/gmail-trick-reveals-which-companies-sell-your-data.html", "date_published": "2023-06-08 14:30:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "This Steam Deck competitor can turn into a tiny laptop", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s a good time to be a fan of portable gaming PCs. The concept of handheld PC gaming has been around for years, but the arrival of the Steam Deck has caused a Cambrian explosion in designs for this form factor. Take the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://minixpc.com/blogs/news/onexplayer-2-pro-3-in-1-gaming-handheld-console-comes-with-r7-7840u-processor&amp;xcust=2-1-1946724-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">OneXPlayer 2 Pro</a>, for example: This awkwardly-named handheld looks like a typical Steam Deck competitor. But in just a few seconds you can snap off the side controllers, a la the Nintendo Switch, and add a fold-down keyboard to turn it into a tiny Surface-style tablet or laptop.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"OneXPlayer 2 Pro display\" class=\"wp-image-1946770\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/onexplayer-laptop-2-pro-display.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">One-Netbook</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea appears to be giving the handheld form factor more conventional utility. The physical design is mostly inherited from the previous model, the OneXPlayer 2 (sans Pro), which super-sized the usual portable design with an 8.4-inch, 2560&times;1600 screen and room for more powerful components like a full 80mm-long M.2 SSD. That larger screen also makes the keyboard size closer to the mini-laptop form factor that&rsquo;s popular in Asia, though it&rsquo;s still far smaller than standard key sizes. With the controllers removed, the design can function as a small tablet with stylus input or dock to a television and let you play with a controller bracket, again, very much like the Nintendo Switch. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">&#10024;2023 ONEXPLAYER 2 PRO EVA Limited Edition Showcase(Shenzhen)<br /><br />Though it is only available in China, you can win it on 2023 ONEXPLAYER Summer Showdown!&#128526;<br /><br />Join the community to kick off the summer  extravaganza&#65281;&#128520;&#128071; <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://t.co/BmIajYufib&amp;xcust=2-1-1946724-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://t.co/BmIajYufib</a><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/hashtag/SummerGameFest?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=2-1-1946724-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">#SummerGameFest</a> <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/hashtag/Evangelion?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=2-1-1946724-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">#Evangelion</a> <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://t.co/Tf14sAwXBM&amp;xcust=2-1-1946724-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">pic.twitter.com/Tf14sAwXBM</a></p>&mdash; OneXPlayer_Official (@OnexPlayer_) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/OnexPlayer_/status/1665582332202328064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=2-1-1946724-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">June 5, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The upgraded Pro model is really taking no prisoners in terms of specs.

Because it&rsquo;s so small, it can be used in devices, such as a Steam Deck or Mini-PC, that lack space for a full 2280 SSD. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the real news is that it&rsquo;s amazingly fast in the real world&mdash;even compared to PCIe 5.0 drives. Skeptical? We were. But when extended testing garnered the same exceptional results, we were more than pleasantly surprised.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>Further reading:</strong> See our roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407542/best-ssds.html\">best SSDs</a> to learn about competing products</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"sabrent-rocket-q4-design-and-features\">Sabrent Rocket Q4 design and features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve already mentioned the Q4&rsquo;s diminutive dimensions. It&rsquo;s also a PCIe 4.0, NVMe 1.4 SSD that utilizes Micron&rsquo;s brand-spanking-new N48 QLC NAND and Phison&rsquo;s latest E21T controller. I talk those up because they&rsquo;re the reason for the amazingly facile real-world transfers&mdash;far outpacing any previous PCIe 4.0 SSD we&rsquo;ve tested.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Q4 is also a DRAM-less, HMB (Host Memory Buffer) design. That is, it forgoes using DRAM for primary cache (there&rsquo;s really no place to fit it), and instead uses your system memory for that duty. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>HMB is a relatively new cost-saving technology that&rsquo;s improving with every iteration. Of course, its efficiency will depend somewhat on the speed of your memory subsystem. Our new testbed with its faster 4,800MHz DDR5 memory will definitely deliver higher HMB numbers than the old 3,200MHz DDR4 system, so you can&rsquo;t directly compare results with our older HMB reviews. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1939040\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Rocket-Q4-back-with-case.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>On Amazon at the time of this writing the Q4 is available in $44.99/256GB, $76.49/512GB, $109.99/1TB, and $219.99/2TB (tested) capacities. That&rsquo;s hardly bargain bin, but it&rsquo;s not premium-priced either. Given the small form factor and performance, it&rsquo;s a fair deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sabrent warranties the Q4 for an unqualified five years (two years without registration). Unqualified is a good thing because the TBW rating (terabytes that may be written) for the 2TB SSD is a minuscule 450TBW. That&rsquo;s a fair amount of data in the grand scheme, but less than half the norm. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re not familiar, the TBW rating can be used like the mileage in an automobile warranty, ending the coverage period early if it&rsquo;s exceeded. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this case, Sabrent says it honors the warranty period without question, only denying users who try to run scams such as putting a Sabrent label on another, cheaper drive. Yes, there&rsquo;s always someone!  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>When it comes to sustained write speeds, the Sabrent Rocket Q4 is faster than even PCIe 5.0 drives, shockingly.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-does-the-sabrent-rocket-q4-perform\">How does the Sabrent Rocket Q4 perform?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a huge discrepancy between the Q4&rsquo;s synthetic benchmark results, and its times in our 48GB and 450GB transfers. At least in the context of previous SSDs we&rsquo;ve previously reviewed. The synthetics showed the Q4 to be what it ostensibly is&ndash;a mid-tier QLC PCIe 4.0 SSD. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the Q4 blew through our real-world 48GB and 450GB transfers almost as quickly as the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1811977/crucial-t700-nvme-ssd-review.html\">fantastically facile PCIe 5.0 Crucial T700</a>, and actually beat out the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1681210/gigabyte-aorus-gen5-10000-review.html\">Gigabyte PCIe5 10000</a> by a healthy margin. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Talking to Phison, it seems that Micron&rsquo;s new N48 NAND is simply blazing in pSLC mode (pseudo Single Level Cell/1-bit) and the E21T controller itself improves HMB performance. Whatever the reason, we indeed saw real-world sustained transfer speeds from the Rocket Q4 that we&rsquo;ve only seen with the latest PCIe 5.0 drives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CrystalDiskMark 8 numbers shown below are certainly nothing special, and hardly the best we&rsquo;ve seen from a PCIe 4.0 SSD. Note how much faster the PCIe 4.0 <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/828399/wd-black-sn850x-ssd-review.html\">WD SN850X</a> would appear to be. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1937636\" height=\"524\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Rocket-Q4-CDM8.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption>Longer bars are better, and the Rocket Q4 doesn&rsquo;t seem like it should be grouped with these drives given these results. See the next two charts for the reason why.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>But our jaws nearly hit the floor when we ran the 48GB transfer tests. The Q4 took second place among all the drives we&rsquo;ve tested&ndash;far outpacing the WD SN850X, our previous top PCIe 4.0 drive.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1937638\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Rocket-G4-48GB.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>This is a fantastic performance for a PCIe 4.0 drive. Shocking according to previous results, in fact.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Jaws dropped even further when we saw the result of the 450GB write. The Q4 actually displaced the previously unbeaten T700. Yup. The Rocket Q4 is the fastest single SSD at this task we&rsquo;ve ever tested. Stunning to say the least. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1937639\" height=\"599\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Rocket-G4-450GB.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Number one? Yowser. This we were not expecting, but apparently the new Micron N48 NAND is speedy indeed in pSLC mode. I.e., writing single bits.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Note, however, that 450GB is generally not enough to exhaust secondary cache on a 2TB or greater SSD these days, so we resort to additional 450GB writes until secondary cache <em>is</em> exhausted. Despite the chart, the test is less about speed than to see how well secondary caching is handled, and the native write speed of the NAND once it runs out.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, the above results were all gathered using a pristine, empty 2TB drive. Any time the Q4 ran out of secondary cache (pSLC), writes dropped precipitously to below 100MBps. Yikes. That would be after after several long writes, and/or smaller writes with the drive not having time to clear cache by rewriting data in native QLC 4-bit mode. The drop-off will also occur significantly sooner with lower-capacity models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason QLC is so deadly slow when writing natively is the finesse and error checking required to accurately store one of 16 voltage levels to a cell. But be aware that this is a <em>write phenomenon</em> only. Read speeds remain relatively consistent no matter how much data is on the drive.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"should-you-buy-the-sabrent-rocket-q4\">Should you buy the Sabrent Rocket Q4?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For those with average needs, and for most applications, the Sabrent Rocket Q4 is a marvelous drive with fantastically fast real-world sustained performance.

It has a resolution of 3440&times;1440, a refresh rate of 165Hz, and AMD FreeSync.

There are only a few alternatives, like the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1511598/viewsonic-elite-xg341c-2k-review.html\">Viewsonic XG3421-2K </a>and Samsung Odyssey Neo G9, that promise similar or better HDR brightness.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"philips-evnia-7000-34m2c7600mv-design\">Philips Evnia 7000 34M2C7600MV design</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Philips Evnia 7000 offers a unique look with a white finish and speckled &ldquo;terrazzo&rdquo; pattern across the bezel and display stand. It also has a geometric pattern on the rear panel that further separates its design from the pack. The look is not as cohesive as the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1440675/alienware-aw3423dwf-review.html\">Alienware 3423DWF</a> but more fitting for a typical home office.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Philips Evnia 7000 back\" class=\"wp-image-1937539\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/philip-envia-7000-5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>The back of the Philips Evnia 7000.</p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matt Smith/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Philips integrates Ambiglow, an array of RGB LEDs that span the rear of the monitor. These light up to coordinate with what&rsquo;s displayed on the screen, adding immersion with bursts of coordinating color. While it can seem like a bit of a gimmick, it&rsquo;s genuinely fun, especially when used with fast and colorful action games</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The design takes a turn for the worse with the stand. It&rsquo;s too wide, taking up excessive room on your desktop, and attaches to the monitor with an unusual, thin neck instead of a standard VESA mount. A bracket is included for compatibility with VESA monitor arms and stands, but this extra step feels unnecessary. On the plus side, the stand provides 150 millimeters of height adjustment, which is towards the top of what is typical on a 34-inch ultrawide monitor, as well as 40 degrees of swivel and 25 degrees of tilt.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget is-half-width is-float-right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"mentioned-in-this-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\tmentioned in this article\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"viewsonic-elite-xg341c-2k\">Viewsonic Elite XG341C-2K</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Viewsonic Elite XG341C-2K\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/viewsonic-xg341c-2k-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1500\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review product-widget__review-details\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__rating-and-review-link\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__review-details--rating\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1511598/viewsonic-elite-xg341c-2k-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__pricing-details  \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09PZBV2XJ?tag=pcworld02-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;xcust=2-1-1937529-5-1512976-10068&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$1,499.00 at  Amazon</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>This is a curved ultrawide monitor, but Philips opts for a 1500R curvature instead of the more common and aggressive 1800R curvature common to nearly all ultrawide gaming monitors. It may seem less immersive, depending on your preference, but also causes less distortion to the image. Personally, I like Philips&rsquo; approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"philips-evnia-7000-34m2c7600mv-features-and-menus\">Philips Evnia 7000 34M2C7600MV features and menus</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Philips delivers a wide range of connectivity, which includes two HDMI 2.1 ports and one DisplayPort 1.4. These are joined by a USB-C port which also supports DisplayPort alternate mode for a total of four video inputs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The USB-C port provides up to 90 watts of USB Power Delivery. This isn&rsquo;t unusual for a premium monitor in 2023 but still somewhat unusual for a monitor that has a healthy range of gaming features. The Alienware AW3423DWF lacks this feature, for example, but the Viewsonic Elite XG341C-2K also supports it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The USB-C port drives a USB hub with four downstream USB-A ports for wired peripherals. The USB-A port can also be driven by an upstream USB-B port in case your PC lacks a USB-C output.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A joystick on the monitor&rsquo;s right flank is used to control the on-screen menus. The joystick itself is smooth and responsive, but the menus are a total mess. For example, depressing the joystick once doesn&rsquo;t cause a shortcut menu to appear. Instead, you must press the joystick in varying directions to show different menus&mdash;meaning you must memorize what each specific direction will show.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Philips Evnia 7000 menu\" class=\"wp-image-1937543\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/philip-envia-7000-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>The Philips Evnia 7000 on-screen menu.</p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matt Smith/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The oddities continue while exploring the menus, as menu options are confirmed or entered by pressing the joystick in a specific direction instead of depressing the joystick. It&rsquo;s a confusing and frustrating system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At least the menu offers a healthy range of options. It includes precisely targeted color temperature and gamma presets, and sRGB mode (which restrains the wide color gamut), and several picture-by-picture and picture-in-picture options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A pair of 5-watt speakers are built into the monitor. They&rsquo;re stronger than the speakers found in most competitors: Some, like the Alienware AW3423DWF, don&rsquo;t offer speakers at all. However, audio volume remains weak and sounds muffled, so the speakers only prove useful if you don&rsquo;t have desktop speakers or headphones to use</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"philips-evnia-7000-34m2c7600mv-sdr-image-quality\">Philips Evnia 7000 34M2C7600MV SDR image quality</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Philips Evnia 7000 is marketed as an HDR monitor but, like all monitors, it will be used more often in SDR. Fortunately, the monitor performs extremely well out of the box and provides image quality that is both subjectively attractive and holds up under closer measurement.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Philips Evnia 7000 brightness chart\" class=\"wp-image-1937538\" height=\"810\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/philips-evnia-brightness.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matt Smith/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The monitor&rsquo;s maximum brightness of 450 nits is extremely strong and stands out from both OLED and IPS ultrawide monitors. In fact, the monitor can reach a brightness of over 700 nits in certain circumstances, although this is tied to specific image modes that not everyone will want to use. In any case, 450 nits of brightness is more than enough to use in a sunlit room and, in my modestly lit home office, I generally used the monitor at around 20 percent of its maximum brightness.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Philips Evnia 7000 contast ratio chart\" class=\"wp-image-1937545\" height=\"842\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/philips-evnia-contrast.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matt Smith/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Philips Envia 7000 hit an impressive contrast ratio of 4060:1. That is slightly worse than the Viewsonic Elite XG341C-2K, but only slightly, and it&rsquo;s much better than IPS monitors like the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1346674/asus-proart-pa348cgv-review.html\">ASUS ProArt PA348CGV</a>. The monitor&rsquo;s brightness can&rsquo;t match that of an OLED panel like the Alienware, but the contrast is sufficient to deliver a good sense of dimensionality and depth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It should be noted that this result is with the mini-LED local dimming backlight off. In fact, the monitor does not support local dimming in SDR, which is a strange and unfortunate decision. The monitor could perform much better if local dimming was available in SDR mode.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Philips Evnia 7000 color gamut\" class=\"wp-image-1937544\" height=\"806\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/philips-evnia-colorgamut.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matt Smith/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The monitor&rsquo;s color gamut spans up to 96 percent of DCI-P3 and 91 percent of Adobe RGB. This is a wide color gamut that&rsquo;s sufficient for most professional uses, and provides a vivid and highly saturated look in entertainment. The color gamut does not really stand out next to the competition, and in fact, it falls a bit behind OLED monitors&mdash;but I doubt anyone who uses Philips will come away disappointed by its color performance.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Philips Evnia 7000 color error\" class=\"wp-image-1937546\" height=\"871\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/philips-evnia-color-accuracy.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matt Smith/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The monitor provides extremely accurate color relative to its competitors. All of the monitors shown on the graph perform well enough that color errors won&rsquo;t be easy to notice. Still, a lower color error is good news if you need a very accurate monitor for color critical tasks like professional photo editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The monitor also achieved a default color temperature of 6500K and a default gamma curve of 2.2. Both results are exactly on our preferred targets and indicate the image is accurate out of the box.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Resolution comes in at 3440&times;1440, which is by far the most common resolution for a 34-inch ultrawide monitor. It provides a sharpness that is similar to a 27-inch 1440p monitor with a pixel density of about 109 pixels per inch. The monitor usually looks extremely sharp, but some pixelization can be noticed in fine fonts when looking closely at the monitor. This resolution also, of course, is not high enough for editing 4K content, which will be a downside for some content creators.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>The monitor provides extremely accurate color relative to its competitors, making it good for color critical tasks like professional photo editing.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"philips-evnia-7000-34m2c7600mv-hdr-image-quality\">Philips Evnia 7000 34M2C7600MV HDR image quality</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact that Philips only enables local dimming in HDR suggests it should be well calibrated for HDR but, unfortunately, the monitor still runs into some problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brightness is not the issue, as the Philips is VESA DisplayHDR 1400 certified, meaning it can achieve a maximum brightness of 1400 nits. This level of brightness provides great results in bright and colorful scenes. For example, a sunset on a cloudless day provides significant and subtle gradations of light around the sun itself, delivering a realistic and eye-catching look. Animated films that support HDR also look spectacular.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, none of the HDR modes offered a color presentation that entirely satisfied me. I noticed the default HDR game mode elevated the gamma of the display and caused a harsh reddish tint. Other modes did not have the gamma issue but did look a little too cool and blue. And since HDR tends to lock out a lot of calibration options, it can be difficult to tune the experience to your preference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The monitor&rsquo;s local dimming, which is available in HDR content, drastically increases the maximum contrast ratio to 22,000 to 1 in the monitor&rsquo;s VESA DisplayHDR 1400 mode. That is an excellent result and provides a wonderful feeling of depth in HDR content. Unfortunately, this is soured by the Mini-LED backlight with 1,152 dimming zones. It offers a high number of dimming zones for a Mini-LED monitor in 2023, but blooming remains a noticeable issue and will cause bright halos around objects in a dark background.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the whole, the monitor&rsquo;s HDR performance is best suited for bright, colorful games like <em>Overwatch 2 </em>or animated movies like Pixar&rsquo;s <em>Up!</em>. It&rsquo;s not a great monitor for enjoying dark, gritty games like <em>Diablo 4. </em>This is exactly the reverse of what&rsquo;s true for an OLED monitor like the Alienware AW3423DWF, which looks fantastic in dark and gritty games but can seem subdued in more vivid titles.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget is-half-width is-float-right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"mentioned-in-this-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\tmentioned in this article\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"alienware-aw3423dwf\">Alienware AW3423DWF</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Alienware AW3423DWF\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/alienware-aw3423dwf-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1500\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review product-widget__review-details\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Editors' Choice\" class=\"product-widget__review-details--editors-choice-logo\" src=\"https://www.pcworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PC-ED-CHOICE.png\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__rating-and-review-link\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__review-details--rating\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1440675/alienware-aw3423dwf-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<h2 id=\"philips-evnia-7000-34m2c7600mv-motion-performance\">Philips Evnia 7000 34M2C7600MV motion performance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Philips Evnia 7000 has a maximum refresh rate of 165Hz, which looks good on paper. After all, it&rsquo;s the same as the Alienware AW3423DWF. Yet the monitor&rsquo;s real-world performance is not as impressive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blame the Vertical Alignment (VA) panel. This type of panel is known for having a problem called dark smear, which is caused by darker areas of the screen experiencing elevated pixel response times. This problem is evident here even when the monitor is used at its lowest SmartResponse mode of Fast. The Faster is worse still and the Fastest mode is comically bad, introducing major color shifts and huge dark streaks behind moving objects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Motion can look reasonably clear with SmartResponse set to Fast, especially in brighter scenes, and the 165Hz refresh rate provides excellent responsiveness and fluidity compared to a monitor with a lower refresh rate. However, when compared with an OLED monitor, or even a quality IPS monitor, it&rsquo;s clear that Philips falls behind. The problem is not just an issue in games, either. Rapidly scrolling a web page or app with a dark background often makes its content illegible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The monitor officially supports AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, which worked well in my testing with an AMD 6000-series video card. It should also work as a G-Sync Compatible display with Nvidia video cards, but this is unofficial and may not function in all cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"should-you-buy-the-philips-evnia-7000\">Should you buy the Philips Evnia 7000?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Philips Evnia 7000 has many strengths, but also several weaknesses, making it impossible to recommend at its MSRP of $1,300.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Philips&rsquo; biggest problem is the Alienware AW3423DWF, an OLED monitor that outperforms the Philips in most metrics, aside from brightness, and can often be purchased for as little as $1,000. There are advantages to the Philips, such as far better HDR brightness and superior sharpness, but these perks are outweighed by issues like mediocre motion clarity and disabled local dimming in SDR mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the Philips Evnia 7000 is the latest example of a promising Mini-LED monitor held back from its full potential.</p>\n\nMonitors</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1937529/philips-evnia-7000-monitor-review.html", "date_published": "2023-06-08 10:30:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "An Instabridge eSim, on sale for just $149, would make a perfect gift for Dad", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever tried using your cellular data while traveling abroad, then you already know how prohibitively expensive the practice can be.

Vivaldi has used this technology before, identifying itself as Google Chrome, to try and accomplish the same task. Now, the company says, some websites are seeing through its mask and blocking Vivaldi regardless.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you access Bing&rsquo;s AI-powered Chat feature on Edge, the browser allows you to converse with Microsoft&rsquo;s AI chatbot. You&rsquo;ll have a similar experience with Google Chrome. On Vivaldi, your access to the site is blocked by a massive popup that asks you to download Edge instead. What Vivaldi 6.1 simply hopes to accomplish is allowing you to access Bing Chat without the need to download Microsoft Edge or Chrome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Edge, Chrome, and Vivaldi are all based upon Chromium, the open-source version of the Chrome browser. But Vivaldi has <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://vivaldi.com/blog/technology/client-hints-or-client-lies/&amp;xcust=2-1-1945959-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">complained before</a> that the web is prejudiced towards the Chrome browser, and its own version nomenclature. As a result, the browser company has tried to transition away from using an identifying string known as the UserAgent to what&rsquo;s known as <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://github.com/WICG/ua-client-hints#what-user-needs-are-solved-by-reducing-the-user-agent-header-or-adding-user-agent-client-hints-to-the-web-platform&amp;xcust=2-1-1945959-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Client Hints</a>, which arguably helps users maintain more privacy by simply telling the site what it needs to know.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Bing Chat on Vivaldi\" class=\"wp-image-1945995\" height=\"667\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bing-Chat-on-Vivaldi.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>When you try to access Bing Chat on the Vivaldi browser, you&rsquo;ll see this screen.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Vivaldi would like to proudly announce itself as Vivaldi, but the current state of the web makes this difficult,&rdquo; Vivaldi said in a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://vivaldi.com/press/embargoed/vivaldi-bypasses-restrictions-to-access-bing-chat/&amp;xcust=2-1-1945959-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">blog post</a>. The company hopes that Bing Chat will now be accessible via Vivaldi Mobile on Android, as well as the desktop version. It can&rsquo;t be known for sure, however, whether Vivaldi&rsquo;s approach will work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For its part, Microsoft said that it will make Bing Chat available to other browsers, eventually. &ldquo;The company plans to bring the new experience to other browsers over time and we&rsquo;ll be sure to keep you updated on the latest,&rdquo; a Microsoft representative said via email.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is true, however, is that the dogfight to lure users to AI is becoming increasingly desperate. The Verge <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/6/23736289/microsoft-bing-chrome-search-fake-ai-chatbot&amp;xcust=2-1-1945959-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">discovered</a> that Microsoft was hiding Bing Chat searches for &ldquo;Chrome&rdquo; by showing the advantages of Bing Chat, instead. And Microsoft, which originally blocked Google Chrome users from accessing Bing Chat, now allows access &mdash; though on our machine, access was only allowed on the second try. Vivaldi seems to be caught in the crossfire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, Vivaldi 6.1 introduces minor changes: You&rsquo;ll be able to copy links saved in <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/427175/this-is-neat-you-can-stack-and-tile-browser-tabs-in-the-vivaldi-beta-browser-for-power-users.html\">Vivaldi&rsquo;s Tab Stacks</a> and send them to other users. You can also use Tab Stacks and Tab Tiling within Vivaldi&rsquo;s Workspaces, another nifty organizational feature the company launched in April. Vivaldi also plans to launch on iOS soon, it said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\nPersonal Software</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1945959/vivaldi-wears-edge-mask-to-access-bing-chat-as-ai-wars-turn-vicious.html", "date_published": "2023-06-08 07:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
