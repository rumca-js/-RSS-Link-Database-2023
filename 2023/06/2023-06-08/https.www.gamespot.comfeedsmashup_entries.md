But before they can finish what they're saying, Garcia Hotspur (the game's protagonist) shoots up the office and shoots them out a window.

<p>Two new Persona games, Persona 3 Reload and Persona 5 Tactica have leaked online thanks to Atlus posting trailers for both games early. Persona 3 Reload launches in early 2024 on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Windows, while Persona 5 Tactica releases November 17 on the same platforms. Both trailers indicate that the games will be available via Xbox Game Pass at launch.</p><p>First up is Persona 3 Reload, which is a remake of Persona 3. There have been multiple versions of Persona 3 over the years, with each version including and excluding various features. It's unclear from the trailer if Persona 3 Reload will include everything from the different versions, or if some aspects will be cut. The trailer notably only shows the male version of the protagonist, which could imply the female version won't be included in this remake. The female version has previously only been included in Persona 3 Portable.</p><p>The remake uses a third-person perspective and includes direct exploration of the main city. This version of Persona 3 looks much closer to Persona 5 in its menus and social scenes. The combat looks much closer to the original version of Persona 3, with the party members surrounding the enemy shadows in a 3D space.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/persona-3-reload-and-persona-5-tactica-leaked-launching-on-xbox-game-pass/1100-6514996/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

During the showcase, several new titles and in depth looks at previously announced games were revealed, sufficiently hyping us up for the next year and beyond.</p><p>Among numerous other games, we got a better idea of what Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth's open world will look like, a release date for Marvel's Spider-Man 2, and first looks at new Prince of Persia and Sonic entries. We also saw Mortal Kombat's newest mechanic, the Kameo system, and plenty of spooky games with Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden, Alan Wake II, and Lies of P. And hey, there will also <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1666915200086454272?s=20">no arrests made this year</a>, which is always the sign of a pretty solid show.</p><p>Here is a round up featuring some of the games we are most excited for, as well as a bit more information on the upcoming titles and some release dates.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1639/16394322/4149830-summergamefest2023livestream3-3-11screenshot.png" /><br /><h3><p>After more than a decade, a new entry in the Prince of Persia series is on the way. The Lost Crown is a side-scrolling, action adventure game that looks like it will appeal to fans of the metroidvania genre. The gameplay shown highlighted a more modern looking protagonist, melee-focused combat, a whole lot of platforming, and plenty of supernatural elements and mythical monsters. The game is slated to release on January 18, 2024.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Mortal Kombat 1</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1639/16394322/4149829-summergamefest2023livestream3-8-11screenshot.png" /><br /><h3><p>Summer Game Fest brought us our first in-depth look at Mortal Kombat 1, the next entry in the Mortal Kombat series and the start of a new Mortal Kombat universe. Following Liu Kang's ascent to godhood in Mortal Kombat 11, the iconic character apparently created a new universe filled with familiar faces, including Raiden, Sub-Zero, Scorpion, Katana, and Jax. The latest mechanic to be added to the series is the Kameo function, which allows players to select two characters from the roster--a primary fighter and a Kameo fighter--and summon in the cameo to execute special attacks. Naturally, all the series' iconic fatalities remain intact, though several characters throughout the trailer did not. The game is scheduled to release September 19, 2023.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Sonic Superstars</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1639/16394322/4149849-summergamefest2023livestream3-33-56screenshot.png" /><br /><h3><p>2D Sonic is back, but with a sleek and stylish 3D art style. Players can choose between Sonic, Knuckles, Tails, and Amy as they race through classic-feeling stages with updated mechanics and fun new ways to play. The game will feature four-player co-op as well as new abilities, like a grapple hook. Sonic Superstars is coming Fall 2023. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Lies of P</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1639/16394322/4149859-ss_1aa736ef81e943de26cdeed07a2da9696a9d8d9a.1920x1080.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Summer Game Fest brought us another look at Lies of P, an upcoming Soulsborne-style game that follows Pinocchio as he navigates the plague-ridden city of Krat. The footage shown highlights grotesque enemies, the game's umbrella-parry system, and a whale submarine--yes, you read that right.  Lies of P is scheduled to release on August 1, 2023. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Alan Wake II</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1639/16394322/4149872-summergamefest2023livestream3-55-26screenshot.png" /><br /><h3><p>After more than a decade in development, Alan Wake is back. Alan Wake II is billed as Remedy's first survival-horror title, and based on the Resident Evil-style gameplay shared during Summer Game Fest, we can totally see why. The footage shown follows new character Saga Anderson as she explores an abandoned general store and stumbles across a supernatural entity in a deer mask that takes <em>several</em> bullets to knock down. According to Remedy Studio's creative director Sam Lake, the upcoming game will follow both Alan and Saga, with each character receiving about 50% of the game's playtime. Alan Wake II will release on October 17, 2022.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1639/16394322/4149901-4147788-msm2%2811%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Miles Morales and Peter Parker are back in Marvel's Spider-Man 2. On top of featuring two versions of the iconic hero, the game also boasts a map twice the size of Spider-Man (2018)'s, new villains, and a new mechanic in which gameplay will be impacted by Venom's symbiote. Summer Game Fest not only gave us a closer look at Marvel's Spider-Man 2, but a peek at the game's impressive-looking box art and a release date as well. Spider-Man 2 will hit PlayStation 5 on October 20, 2023.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1639/16394322/4149903-ss_5e7f9d6bd0f9dc518e194c6fcc6663b36f83681d.1920x1080.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Dontnod, the studio behind the Life is Strange series, is mixing things up with its next title, Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden. Set in a fantasy land inhabited by spectres and supernatural beings, Banishers  follows Antea Duarte and Red mac Raith, two lovers who <em>also</em> hunt ghosts together. However, after one of their missions goes terribly wrong, Antea is fatally wounded and turned into a spirit herself, causing the two to have to work through some complex feelings and issues. Keeping in line with Dontnod's previous games, Banishers will give players the power to make their own choices as they navigate this heartfelt story.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1639/16394322/4149906-videoscreenshot--youtube-likeadragongaidenthemanwhoerasedhisnameannouncementtrailer-3%E2%80%9912%E2%80%9D.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name is another spin-off title from Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, the developers behind the Like a Dragon/Yakuza series. Set between Yakuza 6 and Yakuza 8, the game follows Kiryu while he is hiding under the codename Joryu at Daidoji Temple. The gameplay shows a bit more of the game's plot and beat-em-up combat.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1639/16394322/4149945-summergamefest2023livestream%28mortalkombat1%2Calanwake2%2Cfortnitenewseason%294-43-57screenshot.png" /><br /><h3><p>Cloud's journey continues in Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, the second entry in the Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy. Set just after the party leaves Midgar, Rebirth will see the party explore the world map and visit iconic locations from the original game, such as Kalm, Junon, and Cosmo Canyon. While Square Enix is not yet ready to announce the game's release date, the studio did give us a slighter narrower window. Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is headed to PlayStation 5 in early 2024.</p></h3></p><br />

<p>Epic Games unveiled <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-4-season-3-start-date-battle-pass-and-optimus-prime/1100-6514710/">Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 3</a>, also known as Fortnite Wilds, during Summer Game Fest. The jungle-focused season, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-4-season-3-wilds-theme-revealed/1100-6514820/">previously teased</a> with a very short video on the game's Twitter account, will begin on June 9.</p><p>In the trailer we see what looks like a ton of new features, including grinding on vines, new flowers that seem to act like bombs and stink bombs, and of course, Optimus Prime himself, who will be included in the battle pass.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">Adventure awaits in a world below! <br /><br />Get ready for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FortniteWILDS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc^tfw">#FortniteWILDS</a>.

Slone was "killed" in the story way back in the Chapter 2 finale, but I certainly always felt sure she wasn't really gone. Now, she's back, likely as an on-island PvE boss for the new season. Fortnite downtime will begin tonight before Chapter 4 Season 3 kicks off tomorrow morning. </p>

<p>Summer Game Fest closed with our first look at Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, the second game in the rebooted FF7 trilogy. The trailer showed the main cast exploring the wider world outside Midgar, following the events of Final Fantasy 7 Remake--including some familiar faces from the original FF7 that we didn't see in the first game. It's coming in "early 2024."</p><p>The trailer had the cast learning about the Lifestream and pondering what prompted Sephiroth's return, as well as the appearance of Elena, the youngest member of the Turks. It also gave us a lengthy look at combat, along with cruising along the world in style on the backs of chocobos. The first game established a new continuity for the series, and this looks to continue that. Major characters like Tifa are confused about what happened in the intervening five years, including some notable disparities between realities.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">Get a first glimpse at the captivating story, thrilling gameplay and expansive world of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the highly anticipated new story in the critically acclaimed FFVII remake project. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FF7R?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc^tfw">#FF7R</a> <a href="https://t.co/7N1IUNzzfQ">pic.twitter.com/7N1IUNzzfQ</a></p>  — FINAL FANTASY VII (@finalfantasyvii) <a href="https://twitter.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1666910002588831744?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">June 8, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth has been developed under a cloud of secrecy, as this next chapter in the Remake trilogy features a new storyline that isn't bound to the events of the original Final Fantasy VII.

The presentation gave us a fresh look at one of the most-anticipated games of the year.</p><p>Unlike the previous two games, Baldur's Gate 3 makes use of a turn-based combat system based on the D&amp;D 5e role-playing system, and it launched in early access back in 2020 on PC. But there was a surprising new addition tucked away in the game's new trailer: Renowned actor Jason Isaacs is joining the voice cast as Lord Envor Gortash.</p><div>          </div><p>Described by Larian Studios as a man who "freed himself of his bonds to envision wonders and become a master of both men and mechanisms," Gortash appears to be an imposing figure with a large amount of gravitas and the ability to command a room (and an army) without breaking a sweat.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-adds-jason-isaacs-to-cast-new-collectors-edition-revealed/1100-6514928/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>A new gameplay trailer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/immortals-of-aveum/">Immortals of Aveum</a> was shown during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-2023-the-biggest-games-announcements/2900-4769/">Summer Games Fest</a>. The trailer focused on a battle taking place on a mech in the middle of the ocean, showing off a variety of magic abilities.</p><p>The sequence shows off some prominent abilities, like a whip, which can be used to both throw enemies and pull yourself towards objects as you fight enemies in small, arena-like areas. The main character is a special type of battle mage who has access to all three colors of magic, with explosive red magic, rapid fire green magic, and more AoE focused purple abilities. The combat moves quickly, seemingly inspired by the fast-paced action of shooters like Doom Eternal.</p><p>The combat shown in the trailer looks inspired by Doom Eternal, with a ton of different magical abilities mixed in. In addition to the primary attacks that function more like guns, an ability menu is shown at one point, where special magic attacks are used. The one in the trailer makes a small black hole that sucks enemies into a single area for an easy follow-up. A shield is shown as well that is used to block enemy ranged attacks, and there is a button prompt on the screen that suggests some type of ultimate ability, although it isn't shown.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/action-packed-trailer-showcases-immortals-of-aveums-magical-fps-gameplay/1100-6514989/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Star Trek: Infinite, a new game set in the iconic sci-fi franchise from developer Nimble Giant Entertainment and publisher Paradox Interactive, has been announced as part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-2023-the-biggest-games-announcements/2900-4769/">Summer Game Fest</a>.</p><p>Details are extremely light so far, so much so that it's unclear exactly what type of game Star Trek: Infinite will be. A brief teaser trailer shows a Federation fleet headed for a showdown with one of Star Trek's most well-known villains, the Borg, before zooming out to reveal a galaxy map divided into four quadrants.</p><div>          </div><p>From the faction icons shown in the trailer, it looks like players will be able to choose between the Federation, Cardassian Union, Klingon, and Romulan empires. The Borg seem to be missing on the map, seeming to imply they may simply be an obstacle for players to overcome rather than a playable faction all their own.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-trek-infinite-trailer-teases-a-showdown-between-galactic-empires/1100-6514987/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Spider-Man 2 creative director Bryan Intihar took the stage at Summer Game Fest to share more details on the upcoming Insomniac game, including a release date. After sharing some story details, Intihar announced the release date of October 20, saying he's "very confident" that the team will hit that date.</p><p dir="ltr">While we were previously left to infer that Venom would play a role in this game due to Peter showing up in the symbiote suit, this time we saw actual concept art of Peter and Miles taking on a full-fledged Venom. But, Intihar said, this won't be Eddie Brock in the suit. Instead, the studio wanted to tell an original story that's different than what Spidey fans may be expecting. Intihar also said the city has doubled in size.</p><p dir="ltr">Alongside the Summer Game Fest appearance, the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/06/08/marvels-spider-man-2-arrives-only-on-ps5-october-20-collectors-digital-deluxe-editions-detailed/">PlayStation Blog</a> revealed preorder bonuses and collector's editions.

<p>Netflix's adaptation of The Witcher book series by Andrzej Sapkowski gave megafan of the series and star Henry Cavill, a passion project as Geralt of Rivia. After three seasons, Cavill is leaving the sword and sorcery series leaving <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/henry-cavill-is-leaving-the-witcher-for-season-4-replaced-by-liam-hemsworth/1100-6508734/">Liam Hemsworth taking up the greatswords</a> of the Witcher, but the Season 3 trailer still has plenty of action for fans to take in before Cavill takes a bow. </p><p>Geralt and sorceress Yennefer are fighting to keep Witcher-in-training Ciri safe as war brews on the Continent. While the trailer tones down the monster hunting with more dramatic intrigue on the forefront, Geralt will still be facing off against some hellish beasts, trying to make the world safe one kill at a time. Check it out the trailer below. </p><div>          </div><p>Season 3 adapts the second book in author Andrzej Sapkowski's Witcher series, Time of Contempt. "For years, Geralt has claimed neutrality, shunned politics, and publicly asserted that witchers don't have emotions--all to make his life as a killer easier to navigate. We've seen him battle monsters and monstrous humans; we've watched as he's hardened himself in order to survive. This season, he can no longer do that," series creator and showrunner Lauren Hissrich said in a <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/the-witcher-season-3-sneak-peek">blog post</a>.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflixs-witcher-season-3-trailer-goes-all-out-for-cavills-last-outing/1100-6514972/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Ubisoft has announced a revival of the Prince of Persia franchise with Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown. The game is being developed by Ubisoft Montpellier, the studio behind the beloved platformer Rayman Legends, and harkens back to the series' origins as a 2D adventure game. It's coming January 18, 2024.</p><p dir="ltr">The game is unrelated to the postponed remake of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time being developed by Ubisoft Montreal following work by Ubisoft Pune and Ubisoft Mumbai. The remake has been hit by a series of delays since its announcement in September 2020, and in May 2023 Ubisoft confirmed that the game would not appear at June's Summer Game Fest as the game was "still in an early stage."</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">Presenting: Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, an action-adventure platformer game set in a mythological Persian world.<br /><br />The new <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PrinceofPersia?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc^tfw">#PrinceofPersia</a> releases on January 18th, 2024 on all platforms.<br /><br />See more gameplay at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UbiForward?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc^tfw">#UbiForward</a> <a href="https://t.co/V7edJ1gJdg">pic.twitter.com/V7edJ1gJdg</a></p>  — Ubisoft Nordic (@ubisoftnordic) <a href="https://twitter.com/ubisoftnordic/status/1666884285859504129?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">June 8, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">We recently had the opportunity to visit Ubisoft Montpellier and play The Lost Crown, and we'll have more on the game following <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-forward-2023-start-times-how-to-watch-and-what-games-to-expect/1100-6514851/">Ubisoft Forward</a> next week.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-new-prince-of-persia-game-in-13-years-announced/1100-6514966/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Disney Dreamlight Valley The Dark Castle Quest Guide

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/disney-dreamlight-valley/">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a> may be a cozy game, but its main questline deals with some dark themes like anger, resentment, and abandonment. If you've worked with Merlin to wrap up "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-the-forgotten-relics-quest-guide/1100-6514958/">The Forgotten Relics</a>" quest, you'll be tackling one the darkest quests of all: "The Dark Castle." This last stand against The Forgotten culminates in the finale of the game (for now), so let's walk you through how to finish things up.</p><h2>How to complete The Dark Castle quest in Dreamlight Valley</h2><p>"The Dark Castle" quest begins after you finish "The Forgotten Relics," with Merlin opening a portal into the dark realm where you'll need to face off against The Forgotten themselves. But before you can reach the villain, you'll have to open some doors to reach new levels of the castle.</p><h3>How to open the first-floor door</h3><p>Opening the door on the first floor requires you to <strong>equip a crown and wings</strong>. In our case, this was the Onyx Crown and Thorny Wings, but we were given a few different options to choose from. Speak to the door when you've got these equipped and it will open the second floor to you.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-the-dark-castle-quest-guide/1100-6514963/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Once you've wrapped up enough questlines in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/disney-dreamlight-valley/">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a>, Merlin will eventually have a special quest for you. Your goal is to put an end to the disastrous efforts of your less friendly (shall we say, evil?) self, but you'll first need to round up four relics to open a portal to the Dark Castle. Here's where to find them all so you can get back to cleaning up your valley.</p><h2>All Forgotten Relics locations in Disney Dreamlight Valley</h2><p>There are four relics to find once you've accepted the quest. Merlin will assist you with the first one, but you'll be required to round up the last three yourself.</p><h3>The Book</h3><p>The Book is located in Mickey's House, which Merlin will escort you to. Inside, you'll find this relic sitting on Mickey's coffee table, and picking it up prompts a secondary questline called "The Forgotten Relics: The Book." To complete this extra activity, simply go speak with Mickey.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-the-forgotten-relics-quest-guide/1100-6514958/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Rockstar has just revealed all changes happening to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v/">GTA Online</a> next week. As a part of the San Andreas Mercenaries update, changes will be made to vehicles, gameplay, balancing, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">Players will now have the option to claim all their destroyed vehicles at once whenever they file a Mors Mutual Insurance claim, and Mors Mutual will no longer charge whenever someone claims their vehicle during contact missions. There'll now be a custom description tag for garages to help players find their cars more quickly whenever they call a mechanic. Now players can select specific floors via Eclipse Blvd Garage. When the d-Pad is pressed whenever someone is flying the F-160 Raiju, it'll enter Stealth Mode, and it will do this if a holds L3/LS while flying any VTOL aircraft in and out of VTOL mode.</p><p dir="ltr">Going forward, players can now use The Willard Eudora and Albany Classique Broadway when participating in Taxi Work, and there'll also be more filters for race jobs via Jobs Menu. Less popular vehicles will be removed from the in-game websites to help "streamline the browsing experience." But don't worry, because they'll still be available in other event places such as The Lucky Wheel and more.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-online-update-adds-new-career-progress-feature/1100-6514960/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

But the reason behind his retirement is surprisingly wholesome: Unlike his on-screen alter-ego Walter White, Cranston is stepping away from the spotlight (and the consierable money that comes with it) in favor of spending more time with his family--especially his wife, Robin.</p><p dir="ltr">"I want to change the paradigm once again," Cranston said regarding his marriage. "For the last 24 years, Robin has led her life holding onto my tail. She’s been the plus-one, she’s been the wife of a celebrity. She’s had to pivot and adjust her life based on mine. She has tremendous benefit from it, but we’re uneven. I want to level that out. She deserves it."</p><p dir="ltr">"My wife is so sensitive and so beautiful and lovely, and she gets her little feelings hurt and she’s just quiet, and I’m like, 'Oh, I’ve wounded a bird, oh man,'" he explained, adding that he has grown to be "pretty free in saying 'I'm sorry.'"</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bryan-cranston-announces-temporary-retirement-from-acting-and-his-reasons-are-surprisingly-wholesome/1100-6514965/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The Elden Ring mod Garden of Eyes has just made a massive change to the game, which now has a little bit of Dragon Age: Origins flavor in it. If you install the mod, each class has its own, newly created tutorial area and starts the game proper from a new place on the standard world map. Progression throughout the game for each class has also been overhauled. The update essentially adds dynamic difficulty, shifting the power of enemies and the effectiveness of pickups around your new starting location.</p><div>          </div><p>A video from the developers offers the example: the mod-exclusive Nomad Merchant class. After a tutorial area in Leyndell Sewers, the Nomad Merchant emerges in Altus Plateau, a mid- to late-game area in the original Elden Ring. However, Altus Plateau's difficulty is adjusted to that of a starting area and key items are now found in new locations. The difficulty of further areas is adjusted depending on where you explore first. Each class also has unique "memory" segments, where you can explore the backstory of your chosen class.</p><p>The overall mod is a tremendous effort even without this massive change to the game's core structure. It adds over 20 new weapons, over 30 new kinds of armor, over 20 new spells, new horses and new mechanics (like trap mine items), in addition to new areas and bosses. You can play the mod in its early access version by subscribing to the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/GardenOfEyes">Garden of Eyes Patreon</a>. The full mod will be available for free once it is completed.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-mod-adds-new-starting-areas-based-on-your-class/1100-6514957/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Not only will you be building the console itself, but you’ll also get to piece together three Atari cartridges (Asteroids, Adventure, and Centipede), a cartridge holder, controller, and three mini-builds inspired by those iconic games.</p><figure style="width: 1486px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4149645-gallery.jpg"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1702/17023653/4149645-gallery.jpg" /></a></figure><figure><div class="image-gallery__label">Gallery</div>   <div class="image-gallery__list hide-scrollbar image-gallery__list--small">       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4149646-fullkit.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 1" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4149646-fullkit.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4149647-minibuild.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 2" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4149647-minibuild.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4149648-hiddeneastereggs.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 3" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4149648-hiddeneastereggs.jpg" />     </a>   </div>  </figure><p>Once the build is complete, you’ll have a console that’s 13 inches wide, 3 inches tall, and 8.5 inches wide for a faithful, nearly 1:1 replica of the original Atari 2600.

## College Football Players Urged To Boycott EA's Upcoming CFB Game By Union

<p dir="ltr">The College Football Players Association has reportedly urged college football players to boycott EA's upcoming revival of its long-running CFB franchise, calling the amount offered to players for their appearance "just a ridiculously low amount of money."</p><p dir="ltr">As separately reported by sports outlets <a href="https://www.on3.com/nil/news/college-football-players-association-organizing-boycott-of-2024-ea-sports-video-game/">On3</a> and <a href="https://www.sportico.com/leagues/college-sports/2023/cfb-players-return-ea-sports-game-but-500-payout-debated-1234723300/">Sportico</a>, the cash pool for CFB athletes is "in the $5 million neighborhood," which roughly translates to $500 per player. As currently constructed, the deal will also not provide any royalties to players. CFBPA representative Justin Falcinelli told On3 that "all current players should boycott the deal," and called it "a simple cash grab." Falcinelli noted that the union obtained data from NFL players that suggested that the payouts from the Madden series are in the range of $17,000 to $28,000 per player. It's unclear what this might mean for the CFB revival, which is currently slated for a Summer 2023 release.</p><p dir="ltr">EA released CFB games from 1993 to 2013, with the first official NCAA Football title coming in 1997. However, the series has been on hiatus for a decade due in large part to lawsuits and uncertainty surrounding the use of player likenesses in the game. Such lawsuits have had a large impact on college sports writ large, with a 2021 Supreme Court ruling paving the way for NCAA players to be compensated for the use of their name, image, and likeness (NIL). This offseason, college football has experienced a <a href="https://www.si.com/college/2022/01/20/ncaa-future-power-5-football-basketball-money">number of controversies</a>, especially those related to tensions between schools in the prestigious "Power Five" conferences and those in the rest of Division 1.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/college-football-players-urged-to-boycott-eas-upcoming-cfb-game-by-union/1100-6514955/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Telecommunications giant Verizon is offering a special Xbox deal in time for Summer Game Fest and the Xbox Games Showcase this weekend. People who switch to Verizon's home internet plan can get a free Xbox Series S, and there don't seem to be too many string attached.</p><p>The fine print states that the deal is only good through June 14, so anyone who is interested needs to act pretty quickly. Anyone who cancels service within 180 days might be charged the cost of the Series S, which is $300. Another thing to know is the promotion is limited to one Series S per order and one console per Verizon account.</p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-100770772-14068796?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.verizon.com/5g/home">Switch to Verizon</a> </div><p>Verizon's Home Internet plans start at $25/month and scale from there. You can <a href="https://www.verizon.com/5g/home/?CMP=sps_h_p_vz_na_ot_2023_05_xboxvhi">visit Verizon's website</a> to see if service is available in your area.

<p dir="ltr">Game developers have expressed hope and concern about the future of AI in gaming, but it seems that for one developer, that future is already here. Myst studio Cyan Worlds apparently used AI tools to "assist" in creating much of the content for its new puzzle game Firmament, and some of its backers are up in arms about it.</p><p dir="ltr">As spotted by <a href="https://kotaku.com/myst-firmament-cyan-studios-ai-machine-writing-art-pc-1850505094">Kotaku</a>, the credits of the game include a paragraph that lists the content that was made with "AI assistance." That list is almost comically long, and it includes: "Journals, logs, checklists, newspapers, stories, songs, poems, letters, loosely scattered papers; all backer portraits; all founders portraits; the 'sunset' paintings; the art-nouveau wallpaper in the Swan dormitory hallways; propaganda banners; coastal spill decal kit; all voiced mentor, announcer, founder, and other speeches; backer-exclusive content." In other words, a large amount of the game's content was created via AI.</p><p dir="ltr">In a statement, Cyan Worlds clarified to Kotaku that these parts of the game were merely "assisted" by AI tools, and gave the game's voice acting as a example. The studio said that the voice acting was performed by an actual human being, but the final performance was modified by AI in terms of timbre, pitch, and tone. This didn't stop several of the game's Kickstarter backers from <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1252280491/firmament/comments">expressing disappointment</a> with Cyan Worlds' use of the technology.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/myst-devs-used-ai-assistance-to-make-latest-game-and-fans-are-unhappy/1100-6514951/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>In the landscape of social media, artistic jobs are landed in interesting ways with fan artists getting hired for official work with an IP they love.

## Best Mortal Kombat Games, Ranked

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4147090-mkgames.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">With <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-preorder-guide/1100-6514329/">Mortal Kombat 1 arriving in September</a> and ushering in a fresh (sort of) start for the franchise, now is a great time to look at every game that led to this moment. The original Mortal Kombat was a landmark moment for gaming, one that pushed the limits of gaming hardware at the time with photorealistic warriors that stood apart from the more cartoonish visuals of fighting games of the era. Relentlessly violent and gruesomely innovative, Mortal Kombat would continue to evolve over the years and race toward the bleeding edge of interactive entertainment. As you'll see on our best Mortal Kombat games list below, that evolution often led to new peaks. Needless to say, we're looking forward to seeing what NetherRealm does with Mortal Kombat 1.</p><p dir="ltr">There have been spin-offs and movies, Saturday morning cartoons, and live-action series over the decades, but nothing beats the core series of games that tell one overarching story across multiple timelines and Mortal Kombat tournaments. Most of these games have been great, perfect weekend fodder for when you have some friends around and you're looking to chill by ripping their guts out. In the game, that is. Some Mortal Kombats have also been terrible, some have been bafflingly bad, and we're listing them all below--starting with the very worst, an archaic entrant from the late '90s realm of three-dimensional brawling. We’re focusing on the core series of Mortal Kombat games, which means that spin-offs like Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero and Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks aren’t included on this list.</p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100770772-13797872?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/mortal-kombat-1">Save on Mortal Kombat 1 preorder</a> </div></div><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100770772-13797872?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.fanatical.com/en/franchises/mortal-kombat">Shop Mortal Kombat series</a> </div></div><p> </p><p><em>Disclosure: GameSpot and Fanatical are both owned by Fandom.</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>11. Mortal Kombat 4 (1997)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4147085-mk4.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Mortal Kombat's first dive into the realm of three-dimensional brawling is easily the lowest point in the history of the franchise, even if Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero was released the same year. Ugly to look at in 1997 and harder on the eyes in 2023 than an X-Ray attack, Mortal Kombat 4 was even more horrible to play. Unresponsive controls, gimmicky 3D gameplay systems, and an underwhelming narrative all combine to create a lackluster entry in the series. But at least those wonderfully cheesy cinematics helped the game live on long after it had been succeeded by vastly improved chapters in the franchise.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>10. Mortal Kombat: Armageddon (2006)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4147075-mk7.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Bigger than Michael Bay's demolition budget on a film set, Mortal Kombat Armageddon was supposed to be the final chapter in the fighting game's saga that was too massive for its own good. Favoring quantity over quality, Armageddon's gigantic roster meant that cuts had to be made to squeeze every warrior onto a single disc. Individual fighting styles dropped from three to two, there were fewer unique fatalities, and the Konquest storyline paled in comparison to the superb tale of Shujinko in Deception.</p><p dir="ltr">Armageddon was impressively ambitious and ended with a shocking cliffhanger that would pave the way for Mortal Kombat's best era, and it still had space for a few interesting ideas. The Create-A-Fighter mode gave players the option to create a custom character from a wide selection of body parts, costumes, weapons, and special moves, and to take things a bloody step forward, the Create-A-Fatality option allowed for the creation of custom finishers. Players could create their very own custom fatalities by stringing together different attacks and transitioning into their gory finisher.</p><p><em>Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mortal-kombat-armageddon-review/1900-6171983/">Mortal Kombat: Armageddon review</a>.</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>9. Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe (2008)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4147076-mk8.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">The "yes this actually happened" of the Mortal Kombat series, Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe was a fascinating elevator pitch that arrived between Armageddon and the rebirth of the series in Mortal Kombat 9. DC's mightiest heroes taking on Mortal Kombat's deadliest warriors in the mother of all multiversal melees, the end result was instead a watered-down crossover that barely had any teeth thanks to a lower age rating. The combat was average at best, the storyline made very little sense, and the trademark gore had essentially been neutered. Fortunately, NetherRealm would find its DC Comics groove in the Injustice series, while Mortal Kombat prepared itself for a magnificent rebirth.</p><p dir="ltr">It may not have been as over-the-top when it came to violence, but Mortal Kombat Vs DC Universe still introduced a few fascinating gameplay mechanics to the series. Klose Kombat allowed players to engage in close-quarters combat sequences with unique attacks and combos, Freefall Kombat gave players the chance to perform aerial attacks and try to position themselves advantageously before landing after they'd been knocked off a stage, and Kombo Challenges served as in-depth tutorials for each character.</p><p dir="ltr">The other big addition here was the Story Mode, as the narrative fleshed out the crossover between universes and helped establish the formula that would be used for the well-received stories that would be told in future Mortal Kombat and Injustice games.</p><p><em>Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mortal-kombat-vs-dc-universe-review/1900-6201454/">Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe review</a>.</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>8. Mortal Kombat (1992)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4147077-mk1.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The original Mortal Kombat that laid the foundation for the franchise, Mortal Kombat today is a quaint reminder of just how far the series has come since those golden arcade days. The combat was stiffer than Street Fighter and the low kick attack could be spammed for cheap victories, but everything else about the game made it a must-play experience at the time, even if your parents forbid it. Digitized actors spilling entire blood banks worth of bodily crimson fluids, a final boss fight with Goro that could devour an entire federal reserve of quarters, and those glorious fatalities made Mortal Kombat an instant hit at the time and an all-time classic.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7. Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance (2002)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4147078-mk5.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Deadly Alliance was an excellent restart to Mortal Kombat's 3D ambitions, but Mortal Kombat: Deception took that foundation and built a glorious palace of improved gameplay, fun modes, and new ideas that had a substantial impact on the flow of matches. After Shang Tsung and Quan Chi inevitably turned on each other, Onaga was awakened, and Raiden seemingly sacrificed himself, Deception emerged as the best Mortal Kombat of the 3D era. The gameplay was rock-solid, the new deathtraps in stages made each fight unpredictable when facing a cunning opponent, and Konquest mode expanded to become a fun adventure that was almost on par with Shaolin Monks, cementing the legacy of this incredible sequel.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the other new features introduced in this Mortal Kombat was Hara-Kiri, as a defeated player could deprive their victorious opponent of the chance to do a fatality by performing a unique finishing move on themselves. Another big first for this Mortal Kombat was the introduction of online play on consoles, as players could finally connect to the internet and battle against opponents from around the world.</p><p><em>Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mortal-kombat-deadly-alliance-review/1900-2908216/">Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance review</a>.</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6. Mortal Kombat (2011)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4147079-mk9.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Fighting games had been in a precarious position throughout the 2000s, but after Capcom helped resurrect the genre with Street Fighter IV, it was only a matter of time until Mortal Kombat threw its razor-sharp hat into the ring. 2011's Mortal Kombat (commonly referred to as Mortal Kombat 9) is a rebirth that went back to its roots. Not only a narrative retelling of the original Mortal Kombat games that harvests the seeds planted by Armageddon, this Mortal Kombat also went back to basics with its gameplay.</p><p dir="ltr">Other great gameplay systems used in the reincarnation of Mortal Kombat included Tag Team Battles in which players could strategically switch their partners in and out of combat, an improved combo system that could be used to perform longer and more intricate combos, and enhanced special moves in which more powerful signature attacks could be performed. Challenge Towers were another major addition, as this system of unique gameplay scenarios rewarded players with unlockable content. And who could forget the introduction of those devastating X-Ray attacks that provided a gruesome front-row seat to all the carnage that was being inflicted on bodies?</p><p dir="ltr">This is the Mortal Kombat that proved that fighting games can tell terrific stories, and that benchmark would only rise with the release of each subsequent sequel.</p><p><em>Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mortal-kombat-review/1900-6374174/">Mortal Kombat review</a>.</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. Mortal Kombat X (2015)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4147080-mkx.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">MK9 admittedly had a few rough spots, but Mortal Kombat X smoothed them over with more polished gameplay and even more impressively ultra-violent graphics. It's a textbook sequel that raises the stakes and improves on the foundation of the game that came before it, but Mortal Kombat X stands out from the pack with its brilliant storytelling and one of its best rosters yet, a highlight reel of next-generation heroes and villains who hold the fate of all their realms in their hands. From the ice-cold Erron Black to the cheeky Cassie Cage and the downright disturbing D'Vorah, Mortal Kombat X shifted the series into a higher gear.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the more groundbreaking features introduced in this Mortal Kombat was the Variation system. Each character had three distinct variations that offered different moves, abilities, and playstyles, allowing for more flexibility, and interactive environments provided useful elements that cunning players could utilize in battle. With online gaming a major part of its design, Mortal Kombat X also updated its challenge towers with more dynamic objectives that changed regularly. Faction War introduced a meta-game where players aligned with one of five factions--Lin Kuei, White Lotus, Special Forces, Brotherhood of Shadow, or Black Dragon--and earned points by completing various in-game activities in this friendly competition between groups.</p><p><em>Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mortal-kombat-x-review/1900-6416101/">Mortal Kombat X review</a>.</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. Mortal Kombat II (1993)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4147081-mk2.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>If the original Mortal Kombat was a controversial game, then Mortal Kombat 2 was just asking for trouble. Slicker and quicker than the first game, Mortal Kombat 2 dialed up its ability to shed digital blood and introduced some of the most memorable fatalities of the series to fans. On top of that, the game also poked fun at concerned parents with its over-the-top friendship finishers, expanded its roster, and had some of the most iconic art direction in the franchise. Look past the flashy special moves and unhinged bloodletting, though, and you'll find a game that had evolved to not only stand toe-to-toe with some of its biggest competitors but put them on notice with a killer combo of style and substance.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. Mortal Kombat: Deception (2004)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4147082-mk6.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Deadly Alliance was an excellent restart to Mortal Kombat's 3D ambitions, but Mortal Kombat: Deception took that foundation and built a glorious palace of improved gameplay, fun modes, and new ideas that had a substantial impact on the flow of matches. After Shang Tsung and Quan Chi inevitably turned on each other, Onaga was awakened, and Raiden seemingly sacrificed himself, Deception emerged as the best Mortal Kombat of the 3D era. The gameplay was rock-solid, the new deathtraps in stages made each fight unpredictable when facing a cunning opponent, and Konquest mode expanded to become a fun adventure that was almost on par with Shaolin Monks, cementing the legacy of this incredible sequel.</p><p>One of the other new features introduced in this Mortal Kombat was Hara-Kiri, as a defeated player could deprive their victorious opponent of the chance to do a fatality by performing a unique finishing move on themselves. Another big first for this Mortal Kombat was the introduction of online play on consoles, as players could finally connect to the internet and battle against opponents from around the world.</p><p><em>Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mortal-kombat-deception-review/1900-6119566/">Mortal Kombat: Deception review</a>.</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. Mortal Kombat 3 (1995)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4147083-mk3.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Mortal Kombat 3 hits that sweet spot for classic gameplay and fascinating new systems, blending fresh ideas with the trademark violence of the series. You could now close the gap by charging at your opponent, memorizing long strings of combos allowed you to melt through an opponent's health bar, and you could pour salt in the wounds of your opponents with Brutalities, Mercies, and Animalities. Sure, the game might have lacked a few key faces in its roster, but Midway's Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 more than made up for that slip with an expanded cast that capped off the early 2D era of the series in grand style.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. Mortal Kombat 11 (2019)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4147084-mk11.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">We don't know yet how Mortal Kombat 1 will shape up, but we do know that it has a high bar to clear thanks to Mortal Kombat 11. A love letter to the entire franchise, Mortal Kombat 11 has it all. After Mortal Kombat 9 and X set the stage for an ambitious conclusion to not one but <em>two </em>timelines of Mortal Kombat games spread across decades, Mortal Kombat 11 takes that ball and scores a goal for the ages.</p><p dir="ltr">In this outing, custom character variations greatly expanded on the system introduced in Mortal Kombat X. Each character had multiple custom variations that players could create and customize with different moves, abilities, and cosmetic options, allowing for even more versatility. Krushing Blows, powerful cinematic attacks triggered by specific conditions during a match, were added, Fatal Blows were special comeback moves that could be executed when a player's health dropped below a certain threshold, and the Flawless Block mechanic opened up counter-attack opportunities when attacks were perfectly parried.</p><p dir="ltr">On top of that, the introduction of defensive and offensive meters added new tactical layers to the game. The defensive meter allowed for various maneuvers such as rolls, breakaways, and amplified versions of special moves, while the offensive meter enabled techniques like amplifying special moves for added damage or extending combos.</p><p dir="ltr">It built on Mortal Kombat lore and left no stone unturned, pushed the series to new heights in the fighting game community with its robust selection of modes, and delivered not only its best gameplay mechanics but also the most flexible in the entire series with its expanded variant combat and gear systems.</p><p dir="ltr">Mortal Kombat 11 is a celebration of the franchise, and one that's made all the better with the Aftermath expansion that saw the return of actor Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa's delightfully devilish Shang Tsung, ripped straight from the cult-classic 1995 movie. With post-launch support that allowed you to see if Rambo, Robocop, and so many more guest stars could take on the likes of Scorpion and Johnny Cage, Mortal Kombat 11 was proof that NetherRealm had saved the best for last.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mortal-kombat-11-review/1900-6417127/">Mortal Kombat 11 review</a>.</em></p></h3></p><br />

"Allow us to play on the Apple. Let us do it and have a great time," she said. "I paid for it, I was all excited for it.
