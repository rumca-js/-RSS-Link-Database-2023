<p>DuckDuckGo, the privacy-centric internet company best known for its search engine of the same name, released a public beta of its own browser for Windows PCs today.</p><p>Characteristically, the browser puts user privacy front and center. DuckDuckGo said that the browser (called simply “DuckDuckGo for Windows”) boasts “best-in-class” privacy functionality, which is enabled by default. It blocks trackers before they load, which DuckDuckGo said lets it consume fully 60% less data than Google Chrome.</p><p>The browser doesn’t yet support extensions, but the company said that the built-in functionality replicates some of the most common extension use cases, like ad blocking, privacy, password management, and a “Duck Player” mode for watching YouTube that stops the lion’s share of tracking and advertising present on that platform.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3700768/duckduckgo-launches-privacy-first-windows-browser-in-beta.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>Have you claimed the Apple Maps card for your business? If not, you could be missing out on a chance to reach new customers.</p><p>Introduced <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3685291/apple-puts-local-businesses-on-the-maps.html">earlier this year</a>, Apple’s <a href="https://www.apple.com/business/connect/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Business Connect</a> service lets companies and other entities claim and control the information about their business made available through Maps, Wallet, and Siri search. This public-facing information already exists, but you can do much to improve it when you claim the card.</p><h2><strong>What does an Apple Maps card do?</strong></h2>
<p>The Maps card includes basic details about business names and contact information, but once it's claimed you can also add photos, logos, special deals and links to direct purchases from your business. See it as your first point of contact with potential customers who find you on Maps.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3700575/is-your-business-missing-out-on-a-free-apple-opportunity.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>It surprises me that as recently as December, Generative AI wasn’t even on my radar. Now, it's what most of us who focus on technology <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3695572/prepare-for-generative-ai-with-experimentation-and-clear-guidelines.html">talk about all the time</a>.</p><p>Things are changing fast in tech. I’ve seen a number of arguments that we are overhyping generative AI, but then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgWrmnFTnMs&amp;t=0s" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">I came across this video</a> from Wharton University's Ethan Mollick. (It’s around 10 minutes long and well worth watching.) Not only does it show what these new tools can do, but stresses that companies using the tools have reported between a 30% and 80% increase in productivity as a result. </p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3700574/the-coming-productivity-disruption-of-generative-ai.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>While organizations across all US industries are expected to boost hiring in the third quarter, employers in the IT market have the most agressive hiring plans, according to global staffing firm ManpowerGroup.</p><p>Across all industry verticals in the US, 48% of employers plan to hire in Q3, while just 13% expect staffing decreases, according to the survey. For US tech firms, 55% plan to add to their current headcount, up 10% from the previous quarterly outlook.
