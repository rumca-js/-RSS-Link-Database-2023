Based on the insane true story of the GameStop short squeeze, Dumb Money centers on the everyday investors who flipped the script on the rich – with aftershocks that reverberated around the world. In the middle of it all is regular guy Keith Gill (Paul Dano), who sinks his life savings into a single stock: GameStop, the mall videogame retailer, which he’s convinced is undervalued. If he’s wrong, he’ll lose everything. But if he’s right, and if he can convince other ordinary Joes to join the movement, then they’ll rocket GameStop to the moon – leaving billionaires holding the bag.
