Will Thomas was a mediocre male swimmer who ranked #462 as a boy. Lia Thomas is who Kylee had to compete against in the NCAA championships after Will transitioned to Lia. And Joe Biden is the President of the United States <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/trans-athletes-kjp-white-house" target="_blank">who has made screwing over female athletes in favor of pandering to radical leftist progressives a central plank in the Democrat Party's platform</a>.</p><p>Now we know all the players, <a href="https://www.outkick.com/nc-state-swimmer-kylee-alons-change-storage-closet-avoid-exposed-lia-thomas/" target="_blank">here's a story</a> about Kylee's visit to Congressman Greg Steube. Kylee shared how she was forced to change in a storage closet at the NCAA finals rather than experience the sexual harassment that comes with undressing in front of Lia. Lia who, without getting into too many details, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10445679/Lia-Thomas-UPenn-teammate-says-trans-swimmer-doesnt-cover-genitals-locker-room.html" target="_blank">let's just say hasn't fully committed to the whole trans gimmick</a>.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Unfortunately, I have to fact-check Rep. Steube and Kylee. They said it was a girls' locker room. As we now know from Riley Gaines' congressional testimony, when she brought up the issue of Lia Thomas rocking out with her cock out in the girls' locker room, and how it is wrong for the NCAA to force the other girl competitors to be exposed to that, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/riley-gaines-congressional-hearing" target="_blank">Riley was informed by a grown ass man that it was no longer a girls' locker room</a>.</p><p>They "fixed" the problem by making all the locker rooms co-ed. So it wasn't a "girls'" locker room anymore at the time.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<blockquote><em>No one asked for our consent. We did not give our consent to undress in front of a male. ... I went up to one of the officials on the pool deck, and I said, 'How is this allowed to happen?" He looks at me, and, word for word, he says, "Oh, we actually got around this by making the locker rooms unisex. So, it's not a big deal."</em></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/trans-sports-gallup-poll" target="_blank">While 69% of Americans say</a> transgender athletes should only be allowed to compete on sports teams that match the gender they were born with, Biden Democrats and other radical leftist progressives hear stories like this and say, "Meh. You're a transphobe."</p><p>Kudos to Kylee for having the courage to speak out. As we heard from one of Lia's teammates who also spoke out, Paula Scanlan, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/matt-walsh-lia-thomas-teammate" target="_blank">the girls are flat-out told that they'll have their lives ruined if they say anything</a>.

## Bud Light returns to Twitter with new ad and it does not go well for them, like, at all

I hope they allow their social media coordinator to be drunk at work with good beer as they go through the responses. The former #1 beer in America is trying ever so desperately to win back fans with ads that would be unnoticeable prior to <a href="https://twitter.com/budlight/status/1671896007851020290" target="_blank">DylanMulvaneyGatePaloozeGhazi</a>. Now that we know how much the people who run the company that owns the beer hate the majority of Americans who drink (or drank) the beer, this is just lame.</p><p>Or as one tweeter said, Cinnamon Toast Cringe.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>They seem to have settled on "Easy to Drink, Easy to Enjoy" as the new tagline. A bunch of people enjoying a beer while getting those awkward tan lines people get during the summertime. Such relatable. Much inclusive. Very beer.</p><p>But as I said, and much like <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-chicken-fried-commercial" target="_blank">the other ads</a> the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/budweiser-conservative-ad" target="_blank">company has attempted to release</a>, it rings hollow knowing what we know now.

<p>This response was interesting. The Twitter user took a picture of a man. Then was able to find a picture of a woman who looked very similar to that man. What luck! The implication is that if you drink Bud Light, it will turn you into a woman.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>If you guessed the guy giving the other guy a rainbow enema and implying it's just like drinking Bud Light, you win!</p><p>At this point, I don't know what the answer is. I've also never been loyal to a beer brand only to have them accidentally expose themselves as hating me. If you shop and drink locally, that's never a concern.</p><p>The only thing left for Bud Light to try is a "sorry, we f*cked up" commercial. The people who run Anheuser-Busch won't like it and neither will their elitist friends who also don't drink Bud Light. But it might work on the company's now former customers.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Watch: Joe Biden pledges allegiance to the wrong national anthem, takes him twelve awkward seconds to realize

But if nothing else, recognizing the AMERICAN National Anthem should be top of the list. That brings us to our latest example of Joe Biden derping in public. While saying "the whole world is watching" is a lame cliche, Biden was with the Indian Prime Minster so at least a decent chunk of the world was watching.</p><p>Joe Biden is the one on the right.

<p>Some of you may find yourself saying, "C'mon Brodigan, it was a simple mistake anyone could have made." </p><p>If you are saying that, it makes me wonder why you're here. But welcome! </p><p>Fine. I'll be charitable and say best case scenario, someone on Biden's staff did him dirty and neglected to mention the Indian National Anthem was going first. We'll allow the internal investigation to determine if that staffer is a secret Gavin Newsom plant.</p><p>How many "simple mistakes" does it take for people to admit Biden's brain is more tapioca pudding than cerebellum? Because we are at three over the last five days alone.</p><p><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-philadelphia-john-fetterman" target="_blank">Biden did a joint press conference with John Fetterman on Friday</a>.

<p>Then a few days ago, the president had no idea what year it was and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-california" target="_blank">needed to be led by the hand like a child who didn't want to play in the sandbox with the other kids because they would make fun of him</a>.

</p>
<p>Joe Biden has three questions he has to ask staffers on a regular basis: Where am I? How did all these people get into my room? And who took a sh*t in my underpants?</p><p>If Joey was a well person, the awkward ten seconds of "wait, this sounds nothing like the Star Spangled Banner" would be a one-off thing. It's not. This is what we in the blogging profession call a "pattern of derp."</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Watch: California special needs student called "bigot" by teachers for not wanting to learn how lesbians have sex

	A special needs student was (allegedly) called a transphobic bigot by teachers during a health and relationships class at <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/call-of-duty-cancels-creator" target="_blank">Glendale High School</a>. Her mother (allegedly) checked a box on a form that would seclude her daughter from being taught anything LGBTQ+ or sexual in nature. The school (allegedly) didn't care. Also, the student (allegedly) did not use preferred pronouns.</p><p>(Excessive use of "allegedly" aside to appease "independent" "fact" checkers, I know that you know that I know that you know)</p><p>Now that you have the backstory, here is the student's mother wanting to know "what the deuce" from the city council.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rumble">

</p><blockquote>My daughter was taught such acts as scissoring. When my daughter expressed that she should not be in these classes, she was called a bigot by her teacher, she was called intolerant, and she was called homophobic. These are all terms she didn't know, they are not part of our vocabulary at home.  She simply expressed that due to her Christian beliefs it goes against her morals. At that point a staff member told her to look at her skin color.</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>Ah, yes, Because the girl has brown skin and is therefore marginalized, and because everyone on the LGBTQAIIP+EIEIO spectrum is marginalized, the student should embrace learning -- IN SCHOOL -- how lesbians get amorous by rubbing their vaginas together. Apologize for not going right to the link on Urban Dictionary, but at least I didn't use this.gif of Miss Garrison from <em>South Park</em>.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>(I couldn't help myself, but this is what's -- allegedly -- being taught in high school)</p><p>To be fair, Glendale High Communications Director Kristine Nam issued a statement to Fox News claiming it was "a general lesson from the health textbook about making healthy decisions in your relationships," and that the teacher asked the girl "to refrain from making inappropriate remarks." The school claimed no wrongdoing by the teachers but is still investigating.</p><p>Maybe the school is right and the student has her facts confused. But it sounds like par for the course when schools are teaching the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chicago-private-school-dean-students" target="_blank">pros and cons of "spit vs lube"</a> when gay men do butt stuff. Not to mention, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/parental-rights-congresswoman-penthouse" target="_blank">all the glorified Penthouse Forum Letters</a> that find their way on recommended reading lists. Material that had a student looked up on their school-issued laptops <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/school-board-mother-son" target="_blank">THEY WOULD BE BLOCKED FROM SEEING</a> on the internet.</p><p>Where the oldhead in me gets confused in all of this is the extent <em>WE</em> were "taught" how to "have" heterosexual sex was a science lesson about how babies are made and a discussion about not making babies before you were married. We didn't have graphic lessons about doing it doggy-style or reverse cowgirl. Nor was sixty-nining pitched as a method of safe sex. </p><p>Yet, in the name of "inclusion" and stuff like "equity," government-run schools have decided graphic sex is the only way to "teach" students to be tolerant of each other. It's <em>ALMOST</em> as if there is an alterior motive going on.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

Mark Zuckerberg has accepted Elon Musk's challenge to scrap. Until Twitter's Community Notes tells me otherwise, I have but no reason to not believe this is a legit challenge and the two camps are working out the details as we speak.</p><p>On behalf of We the Content, Big Tech Brawl aka ThrottleMania needs to happen.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="instagram-media"><div style="padding: 16px;"> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CtxvVX2rzMk/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" style="line-height: 0; padding: 0 0; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 100%;" target="_blank"> <div style="display: flex;"> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;"></div> <div style="display: flex;"> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;"></div> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 60px;"></div></div></div><div style="padding: 19% 0;"></div> <div style="display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;"></div><div style="padding-top: 8px;"> <div style="color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;">View this post on Instagram</div></div><div style="padding: 12.5% 0;"></div> <div style="display: flex; margin-bottom: 14px;"><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div style="margin-left: 8px;"> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 20px; width: 20px;"></div> <div></div></div><div style="margin-left: auto;"> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div style="display: flex; margin-bottom: 24px;"> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;"></div> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 144px;"></div></div></a><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CtxvVX2rzMk/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">A post shared by THE WEEKLY SCRAPS MEDIA (@theweeklyscraps)</a><br /></div></blockquote> </div><p>This all started with the announcement of Meta/Facebook creating an "alternative" to Twitter called "Threads." Development started three months after Elon bought Twitter and announced that, unlike every other Big Tech platform, he was turning it into a safe space for free speech. Facebook is most known for throttling <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-china-covid" target="_blank">the lab leak theory</a>, the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/hunter-biden-third-laptop" target="_blank">Hunter Biden laptop</a>, and anything we post from the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website. They aren't known for sharing Elon's vision.</p><p>Musk got chirpy about it.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">I’m sure Earth can’t wait to be exclusively under Zuck’s thumb with no other options. <br /><br />At least it will be “sane”.

I'd even be willing to make it winner take all. Facebook vs Twitter.</p><p>Zuckerburg is the guy who takes selfies in the mirror and brags about all the fighting he's doing to create a fake reality for himself on Instagram. You know, like every other social media influencer. The training montage would be Zuckerberg rolling and doing push-ups, while Elon drinks chocolate milk and watches TV. Then when the fight comes, Musk drops Zuck with one punch. Or makes him submit by giving him a wedgie.</p><p>Elon owns Facebook. Facebook stops throttling content. Everyone is happy except for leftists who control Meta and demand content they don't like be throttled. They can step into the cage next.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
