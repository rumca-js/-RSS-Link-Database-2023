We said it would work well on a nightstand as a display-enabled alarm clock, given that the 5-inch screen is on the smaller side. That diminutive size might work well for kids.

Kids can also ask Alexa questions and get audio and visual answers or play music from Spotify, Amazon Music or Apple Music just by asking. Unlike a regular smart display, however, this one is designed to give kid-friendly responses and filter out explicit lyrics. The connected parent dashboard gives you control over time limits and which contacts can be called, while letting you see what your kids are up to by reviewing their activity.

Revealed at Summer Game Fest last week, <em>Sand Land </em>is the latest addition, with a big punchy poster on the show floor in Los Angeles, conveniently right next to an established hitmaker for the publisher, its Naruto (now Boruto) Ultimate Storm fighting series.</p><p><em>Sand Land</em>, though? You may never have heard of it, but don\u2019t let that put you off, because it\u2019s a 2000s comic penned by legendary manga artist, Akira Toriyama. Yes, Dragon Ball creator, Akira Toriyama. The man who created the character designs for Chrono Trigger, Blue Dragon and the Dragon Quest series. And Toriyama\u2019s creations have never looked better.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"ff66fa289a484019918bacbbc27377f6\"></div><p><em>Sand Land </em>is an action-adventure game where you\u2019ll play as the rambunctious prince of the Devil, capital \u2018d\u2019, Beelzebub, as he explores a desert-themed world where water is a rare and costly resource. Demons and humans coexist in this world, with the human Sheriff Rao and the demon Thief accompanying Beelzebub on his adventure to solve the water crisis.</p><p>At SGF 2023 last week, I played a 15-minute demo that showcased a few parts of the game, including melee combat, exploration and two vehicles: a tank and, er, a golf cart. The demo kicked off with the trio fleeing a desert dragon, and after having steered the cart away from relentless attacks, the gang eventually had to cast off their supplies of water to escape.</p><p>Apparently, this is a beat-for-beat replication of how <em>Sand Land</em> plays out in the manga, and you can expect the game to follow the same storyline beats. That\u2019s sometimes frustrating for games where you already know the story. For example, I know who dies in <em>Dragon Ball</em>\u2019s Frieza saga, so it\u2019s not a surprise when it happens in one of the several Dragon Ball video games. With<em> Sand Land</em>, however, many of us will be hearing the tale for the first time.</p><p>During my demo, the game split into two play styles. You\u2019ll explore the desert, outposts, and towns with your vehicles but also set out on foot when you need to brawl with someone or interact with things appropriately.  Bandai Namco has teased that you can customize vehicles within the game, adding different weaponry and components to improve performance or offer tactical advantages. I loved using the armor-piercing rounds. Sure, they had a low fire rate, but they obliterated almost anything. Vehicle controls are simple enough but vary depending on the type and whether they feature weapons or not. Don\u2019t forget: my first <em>Sand Land</em> vehicle was a golf cart. There was no artillery option.</p><figure><img alt=\"Sand Land\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/b1764140-08a4-11ee-bd2b-3d360c06c20e\" style=\"height: 416px; width: 740px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Bandai Namco</div></figure><p>When not rolling around in a tank (which can be repaired if it takes damage), Beelzebub himself can go toe-to-toe with enemies in melee combat. He has a mix of weak attacks, dodge rolls and super attacks that will charge up as you battle enemies. If it sounds a bit\u2026 simple, well, it is. Bandai Namco isn\u2019t reinventing the wheel here. More moves and support characters could help deepen the combat sections, so I\u2019ll hold judgment for now, but it\u2019s also worth remembering that this game is likely aimed at gamers younger than I.  You will only ever control Beelzebub himself, but both of his aforementioned companions will eventually be able to assist in fights, although this wasn\u2019t apparent in my demo.</p><p>The highlight of this early demo was confronting a gang of bandits. They gave off a mild Ginew Force vibe, which I wasn\u2019t mad about. Each wielded different weapons and attacked differently, offering a nice opportunity to test out little devil\u2019s combos, sending enemies high with a punch, only to jump up and slam them back to the ground.</p><p>Ensuring even these secondary characters are interesting is proof that, hopefully, the developers are ensuring  Toriyama\u2019s characters, and his offbeat humor and charm, make it onto consoles.</p><p>While there are some questionable lip-sync moments (at this point, all the voiceovers are Japanese), this generation of consoles and PCs offer more than enough power to replicate Toriyama\u2019s detailed drawings. I gawped at the tank during my playthrough just because it looked <em>so</em> good. Imagine how long I\u2019d stare at a tank I customized myself.</p><p><em>Sand Land will launch on PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC.</em></p><p><em>Catch up on all of the news from Summer Game Fest </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/sgf-2023\"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/sand-land-first-impressions-an-akira-toriyama-manga-brought-to-life-140023184.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/sand-land-first-impressions-an-akira-toriyama-manga-brought-to-life-140023184.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-22 14:00:23+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "FDA approves Owlet\u2019s baby-monitoring sock two years after halting sales", "description": "<p>Owlet and its baby monitoring devices are back in the good graces of the FDA.

After testing multiple brushes for a few weeks, I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that they aren\u2019t a necessity for everyone, but they could benefit certain folks \u2014 particularly those who respond to the gamification of their daily habits.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><h2>What to look for in a smart electric toothbrush</h2><h3>Apps</h3><p>For our purposes, any brush that communicates with a companion smartphone app is one we consider \u201csmart.\u201d Nearly all such apps track your brushing duration and frequency, and can do so whether you have the app open or not. The apps present historical data in graphs, calendars and other easy-to-digest visualizations. Most apps also let you set goals, access tips on better habits and reorder brush heads directly from the manufacturer.</p><p>More advanced devices let you adjust the settings and modes within the app and also guide you through brushing sessions with real-time feedback on where the brush is in your mouth. Other apps grant real-life rewards, such as gift cards, for keeping up consistent habits. Teledentistry is even part of the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=38ae3489-5837-44f5-8356-7e8753b8dd94&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=quip&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzOGFlMzQ4OS01ODM3LTQ0ZjUtODM1Ni03ZTg3NTNiOGRkOTQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2V0cXVpcC5jb20vdGVsZWRlbnRpc3RyeSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOTY0Yzc5YzgtYzI2Yy00YTZmLWFhYjEtZjUxYjhhYWM5YTdhIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAcki7bBjY8bDyuOmmHZp1a3Ssyasohdr_JhD3jfQALOd&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.getquip.com%2Fteledentistry\">Quip</a> app\u2019s repertoire.</p><p>Most people will probably get the most out of the visualization offered by the tracking and history features. I found it satisfying to see a long string of properly executed morning and night brushing sessions, like I had hit some sort of personal milestone. The apps also make it easy to auto-ship brush heads, which could help ensure you replace them more regularly. The ADA <a href=\"https://www.ada.org/resources/research/science-and-research-institute/oral-health-topics/toothbrushes#:~:text=Replace%20toothbrushes%20every%20three%20to,toothbrushes%20can%20be%20used%20effectively.\">recommends</a> getting new bristles every three or four months and I, for one, am terrible at remembering to do that.</p><p>At first, I liked brushing along with the apps that were capable of visualizing my movements, but the novelty wore off after a week or so. Stopping to go find my phone just added another step, and I\u2019d always end up sucked into the new notification abyss before I\u2019d remember, oh yeah, I was going to brush my teeth. While the apps\u2019 simple progress tracking is great, the added goals and awards lost their power to motivate me after a few weeks. Many of us are already setting countless objectives for ourselves; worrying about one more virtual award felt like homework for a class I didn\u2019t have to take.</p><p>The timer feature is what ultimately helped me brush better. My impulse is to put down the brush after about 45 seconds, which is nowhere near the ideal time. To use that you don\u2019t even need the app though, as all smart brushes include a timer in the brush itself.</p><figure><img alt=\"Three screenshots from the companion apps from Oral-B, Philips and Quip smart toothbrushes. The Oral-B and Philips app show a 3D model of teeth, while the Quip app offers gift card rewards for brushing.\n\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/e3867440-0974-11ee-bfdf-3dff994adcae\" style=\"height: 1200px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Amy Skorheim / Engadget</div></figure><h3>Brush mechanics</h3><p>Whether they\u2019re round or rectangular, all the brush heads vibrate, producing tens of thousands of movements per minute. All the handles emit haptic shakes and pauses to tell you to move to another section of teeth and when your session is done. Most of these electric toothbrushes have batteries that last a few weeks on a charge, or in the case of the non-rechargeable Quip, a few months on a set of disposable cells.</p><p>Advanced brushes, usually ones that cost more than $200, also include internal sensors that can detect the orientation of the brush in your mouth as well as the movement and pressure you apply. The brushes use that info to warn you if you\u2019re pushing too hard, moving too fast or missing certain areas, with feedback in the form of lights, vibrations or in-app communication. Some brushes even have tiny, built-in screens that can give you a lot of the same info as an app, such as mode selection, timer duration and simple session assessments, so you don\u2019t have to keep your phone beside you.</p><h3>Price</h3><p>A manual toothbrush from your local CVS will run you $4; smart electric toothbrushes can cost between $50 and $400 \u2014 quite the price jump. Even the least expensive smart brush offers app-based data tracking, plus haptic feedback and sonic vibrations from the brush itself. More expensive versions incorporate features like specialized heads, LED screens and internal sensors such as gyroscopes \u2014 all of which push up the price.</p><h2>Best overall: Oral-B iO Series 7</h2><p></p><p>Including manual and electric models, Oral-B makes around 75 different toothbrushes. Their latest and most advanced iO Series includes a whopping seven different models \u2014 with another on the way. Most of the iO series came out in 2020, which means the iO Series 9 isn\u2019t a newer iteration of the iO Series 5, it\u2019s just a more tricked out brush. The <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9PcmFsLUItRWxlY3RyaWMtVG9vdGhicnVzaC1TYXBwaGlyZS1BbGFiYXN0ZXIvZHAvQjBCNVlSS01NMj90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby0xM3UtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijk2NGM3OWM4LWMyNmMtNGE2Zi1hYWIxLWY1MWI4YWFjOWE3YSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAWyhfV3fU4L9AuUcbkRV9VxD4QDQssU69wM3x-iZQndL&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FOral-B-Electric-Toothbrush-Sapphire-Alabaster%2Fdp%2FB0B5YRKMM2\">iO Series 7</a> has a good combination of app features and brush capabilities, and at $200, it sits in the middle of the smart electric toothbrush price spectrum</p><p>While using the iO Series 7, an internal gyroscope and accelerometer detects where the brush is in your mouth. If you use the app to guide a session, a 3D illustration of your teeth gradually turns from blue to white as you clean different areas. I was impressed by how accurately it detected exactly where I was brushing, especially since I can\u2019t stick to one area for too long before moving on to the next. But by the end of two minutes, it had pointed me to areas I\u2019d missed and left me with teeth that felt noticeably cleaner.</p><p>The iO Series 7 has five different brushing modes, including Gum Health, Sensitive and Daily Clean. I mostly stuck to that last one, but when my six-year-old wanted to try it, I swapped in a new brush head and used the Sensitive setting, which worked great for him. The fact that it made a kindergartener <em>want</em> to brush his teeth might be worth the price right there.</p><p>The app accurately tracked unguided sessions, too, adding the time and duration to my stats whenever I synced the brush with my phone. Even without the app, the built-in LED screen on the handle provides a good amount of info, giving you mode selection and displaying a timer as you brush. Haptic shakes let you know when to switch to another quadrant of your mouth.</p><p>A ring of light at the base of the brush head will flash red if you\u2019re pushing too hard and glows green when you\u2019re using the correct amount of pressure. At the end of a session, you\u2019ll get a smiley face on the display if you went the whole two minutes, got good coverage and didn\u2019t push too hard. You\u2019ll get a smiley with stars for eyes if you <em>really</em> nailed it.</p><p>Oral-B\u2019s top-end <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9PcmFsLUItaU8tRWxlY3RyaWMtVG9vdGhicnVzaC1CcnVzaC9kcC9CMDg4Q0s2WEo0Lz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby0xM3UtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijk2NGM3OWM4LWMyNmMtNGE2Zi1hYWIxLWY1MWI4YWFjOWE3YSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAVA3mFtXrLJ3ECt5TmdiLvwCUzngmPmCx_o2o_hC69JC&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FOral-B-iO-Electric-Toothbrush-Brush%2Fdp%2FB088CK6XJ4%2F\">iO Series 9</a> is nearly identical to the Series 7 but costs $100 more. The pricier version comes with a full color LED screen, two extra modes (Tongue Clean and Super Sensitive) and adds another element to app-guided brushing, showing dots that you gradually erase as you brush. Both devices have hard travel cases, but the one for the Series 9 also acts as a charging case. Those are small luxuries that I don\u2019t think justify the price bump though, especially considering the Series 7 did a great job getting my teeth cleaner than they\u2019ve ever felt outside of a trip to the dentist.</p><h2>Best budget: Quip Smart Electric Toothbrush</h2><p></p><p>If proper motivation stands between you and better dental health, <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=38ae3489-5837-44f5-8356-7e8753b8dd94&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=quip&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzOGFlMzQ4OS01ODM3LTQ0ZjUtODM1Ni03ZTg3NTNiOGRkOTQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2V0cXVpcC5jb20vc3RvcmUvcHJvZHVjdHMvc21hcnQtZWxlY3RyaWMtdG9vdGhicnVzaC1zZXQtYmxhY2siLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijk2NGM3OWM4LWMyNmMtNGE2Zi1hYWIxLWY1MWI4YWFjOWE3YSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAanBtXjbS1UZq6eetJ-k9_4Thix-JWCxqBAFtGKYcQ3D&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.getquip.com%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fsmart-electric-toothbrush-set-black\">Quip\u2019s Smart Electric Toothbrush</a> might be all you need. It costs $50 if you opt for the brush head subscription or $55 without it. Either way, that\u2019s significantly cheaper than many other smart toothbrushes. The vibrations aren\u2019t as intense as our top pick, nor are the internal sensors as precise, but the app is loaded with ways to track your teeth cleaning and inspire you to do it more often.</p><p>One of those is through gamified awards granted for simple achievements like completing 50 sessions or brushing twice a day, three days in a row. It also awards points for good habits, which can be redeemed for real-world perks like discounts on Quip products and $5 Target or Walmart e-gift cards. With its relatively reasonable price and IRL rewards system, Quip\u2019s smart brush might make a nice option for parents who want to help their kids brush better and more often. It\u2019s also handy that the Quip app allows you to pair more than one brush per account, so you can track the whole family\u2019s dental hygiene \u2014 something you can\u2019t do with either Oral-B or Philips.</p><p>Quip divides sessions into 30 second segments and gives the handle an extra buzz when it's time to move to the next quadrant. A run lasts for the gold-standard two minutes and the sonic vibrations help clean better than the same strokes with a manual brush. The app gives you feedback on coverage, strokes per minute and average back-and-forth movement, providing tips for improvement with each session tracked. Like with fitness apps, seeing your trends and history can be motivating in itself. Combined with virtual achievements and real-world rewards, the Quip might be enough for some people to reach that two-minute, twice-per-day goal without the high price or flashy features.</p><h2>Honorable mention: Philips Sonicare 9900</h2><p></p><p>I don\u2019t much care for things marketed as \u201cluxe,\u201d but I have to admit I really enjoyed using the $380 <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOFlDWk5TTEwvcmVmPW94X3NjX2FjdF90aXRsZV8xP3NtaWQ9QVRWUERLSUtYMERFUiZwc2M9MSZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby0xM3UtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijk2NGM3OWM4LWMyNmMtNGE2Zi1hYWIxLWY1MWI4YWFjOWE3YSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAUmO0Hezji_p-HIIWj1utlo1M7pE3L3es9bSPPVeJE2Q&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB08YCZNSLL%2Fref%3Dox_sc_act_title_1%3Fsmid%3DATVPDKIKX0DER%26psc%3D1\">Philips Sonicare 9900</a>. Don\u2019t get me wrong, that\u2019s an insane price to pay for a toothbrush. Before I started working on this guide, my daily driver was a $2.29 job I got from Trader Joe\u2019s \u2014 and I\u2019d like to add that I\u2019ve only had one adult cavity (which I blame on the charcoal toothpaste <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/health/dental-oral-care/does-charcoal-toothpaste-work-a7477277301/\">fad</a>).</p><p>With its sleek design and \u201cpremium materials,\u201d the 9900 made me feel like some overly monied influencer doing a #GRWM (get ready with me) routine. The faux leather and gold travel case looks like a cross between a jewelry gift box and an expensive clutch \u2014 complete with a cute little strap. The brush itself has a pearlized finish and a decidedly smooth feel.</p><p>The app has a clean layout with a detailed history of your past brushing sessions. If you really want to see how consistently you apply the correct amount of pressure, you can. The app is also fairly accurate in identifying areas of your mouth that you skipped or didn\u2019t focus on enough. As for the actual brushing experience, I love the brush head. The bristles are soft and the thin neck is super comfortable to close your mouth around, which helps prevent spillage. I also enjoyed the brush mechanics. Instead of scrubbing back and forth like some commoner, you simply guide the bristles around the surfaces of your teeth, letting the vibrations do the work for you. It took a little getting used to, with the app cautioning me: \u201cdon\u2019t scrub!\u201d but once I had it down, it offered the autonomous functionality you\u2019d expect from such an expensive device.</p><p>The first few times using the 9900, however, nearly broke the fairytale spell. The vibrations are <em>intense</em>. I didn\u2019t realize you were supposed to put the brush in your mouth before you turned it on, and the shaking flung my toothpaste clean off even when I shoved it down into the bristles. Once I finally got it right, I brushed for the full two minutes and afterwards felt like I had just gone to the dentist \u2014 not because my mouth felt clean (though it did), but because my lips were numb like I\u2019d been given Novocain. After setting the brush to the lowest vibration setting, I was able to appreciate it fully without losing sensation in my lips. Maybe I should have expected that much power in a nearly $400 toothbrush, but it took me by surprise.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-electric-toothbrush-133036339.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/best-electric-toothbrush-133036339.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-22 13:30:36+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Sky UK releases a motion-tracking webcam for TV watch parties", "description": "<p>UK broadcaster Sky has unveiled a webcam device called Sky Live designed to add features like watch parties with friends, fitness and gaming features, the company <a href=\"https://www.expertreviews.co.uk/sky-live/1418623/sky-live-review\">announced</a>.

Captain Batel (Melanie Scrofano) \u2013 who for some reason is now a member of Starfleet\u2019s legal corps \u2013 offers a plea bargain with a dishonorable discharge, something Number One recoils at.</p><p>Pike, refusing to passively accept his friend\u2019s fate, jets off to meet Neera (Yetide Badaki), an Illyrian lawyer and former friend of Number One, who has until now refused their pleas for help. His refusal to take no for an answer, and the lure of a high-profile case with which to stick it to the Federation, is enough to convince her to sign up. What follows is the usual courtroom drama, focusing on what prompted Number One to sign up to an organization that hates her.</p><p>We learn Number One was inspired to sign up to Starfleet because of the visible diversity of its crews. But that isn\u2019t enough to win until Neera finds the contradiction between the Federation\u2019s fine words, its goals, and its laws. It\u2019s a subtle, pointed, critique of what Darren Franich dubbed the \u201cCalifornia liberal paradox\u201d in his essay on <a href=\"https://ew.com/article/2016/06/24/star-trek-insurrection-age-hollywood/\"><em><ins>Star Trek: Insurrection</ins></em></a>.

Any hearts and minds that would be changed in this process would be a minority given that \u2013 from this point in Trek history \u2013 things won\u2019t change. Chronologically, we have \u201cSpace Seed,\u201d <em>The Wrath of Khan</em>, \u201cDr. Bashir, I Presume\u201d and \u201cStatistical Probabilities\u201d as affirmations of the status quo. At least a century later, people with genetic modifications remain \u2013 in Trek\u2019s narrative \u2013 unable to serve in its premier military, scientific and exploratory branch.</p><p>It lends the episode a tragic quality that isn\u2019t reflected in its presentation, but one that adds a layer of depth for dedicated viewers. Perhaps what I\u2019m describing as a limit of its storytelling is really a smart commentary on how hard it is to bend the arc of history toward justice. In fact, I think I\u2019ve just talked myself around, this is a wonderfully pointed exploration of this stuff, bravo Dana Horgan and Valerie Weiss.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-finds-the-limit-of-what-a-prequel-can-say-130027427.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-finds-the-limit-of-what-a-prequel-can-say-130027427.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-22 13:00:27+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Oversight Board criticizes Meta for refusing to take down Brazilian pro-insurrection video", "description": "<p>A <a href=\"https://oversightboard.com/news/6509720125757695-oversight-board-overturns-meta-s-original-decision-in-brazilian-general-s-speech-case/\">new decision from Meta's Oversight Board</a> reiterates Facebook's continual role as a platform for dangerous election rhetoric. The Board reversed Meta's initial decision to leave public a video posted in January that called for insurrectionist actions in Brazil following the inauguration of its new president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.</p><p>Lula took office on January 1st, and two days later, a user posted the video of a prominent Brazilian general \u2014 and supporter of the former president Jair Bolsonaro \u2014 telling people to &quot;hit the streets&quot; and &quot;go to the National Congress \u2026 [and the] Supreme Court.&quot; Portugese text overlaid the video stating, &quot;Come to Bras\u00edlia! Let's Storm it! Let's besiege the three powers.&quot; Three Powers Plaza sits in the Brazilian capital and is home to the Congress, Supreme Court and the presidential offices.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Meta had previously acknowledged the risk of civil and election-centric unrest in Brazil, first labeling the country a &quot;Temporary High-Risk Location&quot; in September 2022 and then extending it to late February of this year. Yet, when an initial user reported the video, a moderator didn't find it in violation of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/metas-oversight-board-says-the-companys-rules-are-slowly-changing-for-the-better-100059192.html\">Meta's policies</a> \u2014 a second moderator agreed following an appeal. Seven moderators in total reviewed reports from four individuals between January 3rd and 4th, but none found an issue with the video. An accompanying caption for the video called for a &quot;besiege&quot; of Brazil's Congress as a last-ditch effort. Five days after the video arrived on Facebook, hundreds of protesters broke into the three governmental buildings and set fires, broke windows and assaulted police officers.&nbsp;</p><p>The next day Meta called the riots a &quot;violating event&quot; and claimed to have &quot;been removing content calling for people to take up arms or forcibly invade Congress, the Presidential palace and other federal buildings.&quot; Yet, the video remained on Facebook until January 20th, when Meta removed the post following the Oversight Board's choice to shortlist its review into it. Moderators should categorize a post as violating Meta's rules when it calls for forced entry into a high-risk place (like a government building) in a temporary high-risk location (as Brazil was at the time). Meta stated that leaving up the video with a military official calling for an insurrection was an &quot;error.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>In its decision, the Oversight Board said it was &quot;deeply concerned&quot; that Meta's moderators had continually found the video not to violate its policies. The Board recommended that Meta finally &quot;develop a framework for evaluating its election integrity efforts. This includes creating and sharing metrics for successful election integrity efforts, including those related to Meta's enforcement of its content policies and its approach to ads.&quot; It also called on the company to expand its protocols when evaluating if content causes harm in high-risk events.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/metas-oversight-board-will-take-on-more-cases-and-make-decisions-faster-185523068.html\">The Oversight Board has operated since 2020</a> as an independently funded entity to which individuals can appeal content visibility decisions. It has the power to permit or remove Facebook and Instagram content with statements outlining its rationale accompanying each decision. The Board currently has 22 members (a report claims it will eventually be 40), including Nighat Dad, founder of the Digital Rights Foundation, and Ronaldo Lemos, a Rio De Janiero State University's Law School professor.</p><p>Meta has served as a home for right-wing conspiracy theorists and organizers, with at least <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-hosted-surge-of-misinformation-and-insurrection-threats-in-months-leading-up-to-jan-6-attack-records-show\">650,000 posts arguing against Joe Biden's victory</a> shared on Facebook between Election Day 2020 in the US and the January 6th, 2021 insurrection.

A trio of plain cylinders standing 6.7-inches tall, they mirror the lack of excitement in its name, but as the saying goes, let\u2019s not judge a book by its deeply unsexy cover. Hiding inside is a mesh of extreme quality that, despite a few rough edges, offers a great mix of power and affordability. If you\u2019re confident in your ability to work your way through an admin panel or two, then this might be the mesh for you.</p><h2>Hardware</h2><p>I\u2019ve already mentioned that the XE75 comprises a series of nondescript-looking cylinders which aren\u2019t the prettiest mesh units. They certainly look like WiFi equipment, unlike many of the others on the market, which look like paperweights designed by Henry Moore. Unless you\u2019re living in a minimalist\u2019s paradise, they\u2019ll hopefully blend into your decor with no fuss.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p></p><p>On the back of each node are three gigabit ethernet ports, one of which you\u2019ll need to hook the primary mode up to your modem. You can also use the ports to run ethernet backhaul, if your house is (or will be) suitably-equipped. In 2023, when it can sometimes feel like wired ethernet is becoming a niche proposition, having three ports per node feels like luxury. And I don\u2019t think many users will gripe over a lack of a 2.5 Gbps port which is a bit excessive, even these days.</p><p>One of the first choices you\u2019ll need to make is how you\u2019ll use the 6GHz band, which is reserved as backhaul by default. You can leave it like this or, if you have a plethora of WiFi 6-enabled devices already, you can run it dynamically. Like I said in the mesh WiFi buyer\u2019s guide, using the 6GHz band for backhaul makes sense for now since so few phones, laptops and tablets can access that band directly at the moment.</p><p>TP-Link says its \u201cAI-driven mesh\u201d will learn which devices get faster speed from which nodes and prioritize those connections accordingly. Once each of your devices is connected to the mesh, you should hope to see your speed and reliability improve as it learns your usage.</p><h2>Installation</h2><p>Deco XE75 was easy to get set up, taking just 16 minutes from when I pulled the plastic film from the box to finish. Download the Deco companion app, set up a TP-Link account and you\u2019ll then be guided through the short setup process. You just need to plug the first node in, tell the app if you have any ISP-specific needs, give your network a name and password and you\u2019re off at the races.</p><p>Once done, the app will tell you to turn on the other nodes in the set and wait as they connect to the existing mesh. You\u2019ll also need to assign each node a name based on their locations in your home. My phone pinged several times in quick succession after this as all the gadgets in my home joined the network. The degree of seamlessness and ease of setup was more or less perfect.</p><p>That is, except for one minor real-world annoyance that I feel compelled to flag \u2014 the length of the power cables for the UK models I\u2019ve been testing. A lot of mesh products ask users to place nodes in visible, prominent locations, rather than hidden behind furniture, to avoid interference. That\u2019s harder to do, however, if your power cable is just 57 inches long, a small but noticeable bit shorter than the other products I\u2019m testing. To the point where I couldn\u2019t put one module in my usual location at the top of a bookcase because the cable didn\u2019t stretch that far. In this case, that module had to go on my top shelf, rather than above it. It\u2019s a specific and possibly niche complaint but worth mentioning in case you have an unforgiving room layout.</p><h2>Performance</h2><figure><img alt=\"Image of a single Deco XE75 unit on a white table in front of a bookcase.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/a59fc630-0e9d-11ee-b7be-5795448c8073\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Daniel Cooper / Engadget</div></figure><p>After setting up the modules in the usual places in my home, I found that it took about 10 minutes for the connection to stabilize. I had to run a firmware update that caused things to drop out for a further five minutes afterward, but after that, the connection was very stable. A lot of more affordable 6E routers use the 6GHz band as backhaul, and this worked well in my home.</p><p>Close to the primary node, speeds hit an average of 270 Mbps down, and in my office two floors away, I was still getting 260 Mbps. Even in my back bedroom with its dreaded signal dead spot, SpeedTest download benchmarks fell to around 220 Mbps. Ping times were similarly consistent, to the point where I reckon a two-point mesh might have sufficed.</p><p>The Deco app very clearly shows your network topography, enabling you to quickly see which devices connect to which node. What surprised me is that the hardware in my office preferred the primary node rather than the one that was nearer. I suspect, over time, those connections would shift, but the fact I saw such good performance despite being two floors away was great.</p><h2>App and controls</h2><p>The Deco app lays everything out in a friendly, easy-to-parse manner that shouldn\u2019t deter novice users from upgrading. The home screen shows you the network topography, and what devices are connected to each node by default, helping you to feel in control of what\u2019s going on.</p><p>If there\u2019s a downside, it\u2019s that the level of control available to you inside each submenu isn\u2019t that deep. View your WiFi settings, for instance, and you\u2019ll be able to change your network name and password or share those details to someone else. But the only other option is to decide if the 6GHz network is used for dedicated backhaul or if you can share it with devices on the network. You can activate a Guest Network on the homescreen, letting you set one up with one press, although I\u2019m less of a fan that it\u2019s password-free by default.</p><p>You can scroll the list of what\u2019s connected to the network to see its signal strength, as well as how much data it\u2019s up-and-down-loading at the time. Each device can be assigned to a family member for parental controls, and you can single out a unit for priority on the network. The one downside to this is that TP-Link really struggles to identify each piece of equipment on your network compared to, say, a product from Netgear. So many units were named \u201ciot_device\u201d in the list, that you\u2019ll probably need to take the time to rename them all manually.</p><p>In the More sub-menu, you can run tests to optimize your network, set up an IPv6 connection, as well as tweak IP settings. One feature I appreciated was the choice to get a push notification every time a new device joins the network, which appeals to my paranoia.</p><p>You can also access your settings through a browser-based client but, as far as I could see, the only difference is it lets you force a firmware upgrade with a local file rather than handling the system online. That\u2019s a fairly niche use, though.</p><h2>Additional features</h2><p>Deco does offer smart home integrations, but it\u2019s limited to TP-Link\u2019s own gear and Philips Hue. The only other thing that the company offers is <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=79539c2e-109d-49c3-a6ab-ddd018132f09&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=TP-Link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI3OTUzOWMyZS0xMDlkLTQ5YzMtYTZhYi1kZGQwMTgxMzJmMDkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudHAtbGluay5jb20vdXMvaG9tZXNoaWVsZC8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImRmYWM5ZGU0LTM5NmQtNDU5OC04NTQzLWJmZTJlY2NjYTUzZSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAb8nCulUIU1dPlhHshHJmApXlF5awcVSeTKe_BoNyLdY&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tp-link.com%2Fus%2Fhomeshield%2F\">Homeshield</a>, which offers a suite of security features to help keep your WiFi secure. The free Basic tier will scan your network for security threats and offers \u201crobust\u201d parental controls. That includes the ability to block specific websites, set daily usage limits and time-out zones to stop your kids accessing the internet in the middle of the night.</p><p>You can also activate content filtering, which will lock down swathes of the web that TP-Link deems unsuitable. That includes Adult Content, Gambling, and Download sites, amongst many others. More problematically, you can block access to sites offering sex and relationship education information, which feels like TP-Link is enabling more harm than good there.</p><p>What I will say, despite my objections, is that the suite of options available for free here is a very good mix. Plenty of companies have taken to putting even the most basic parental controls, like time limits and access control, behind their paywalls. The fact the essentials are available here, for free, means the company gets plenty of extra points here.</p><p>TP-Link also offers a paid version of Homeshield, which includes more protection against hacks, greater data about what websites users are visiting. This, it says, will guard against \u201cteenager internet addiction (sic),\u201d \u201cIoT Devices Attacks (sic)\u201d and \u201cCyber Virus Intrusion (sic).\u201d Homeshield Pro costs $5.99 a month, or $55 for a year, although I\u2019m not sure I see enough value in it to encourage anyone to sign up for the extras on offer.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>There\u2019s no single glitzy, attention-grabbing feature that makes the Deco XE75 a must-buy, but what puts it ahead of the competition is its brawn. Nestled inside those cylinders is powerful, reliable hardware that generates a fast and far-reaching network which is reason enough to pick up TP-Link\u2019s system. The app and services offered at no additional cost, squarely tick the \u201cgood enough\u201d box.</p><p>The one thing the Deco XE75 lacks is polish, both in its app and its services. I wouldn\u2019t suggest this to anyone who would freeze up at the very thought of having to make a decision about something like a backhaul channel. But, if you are prepared to make the effort, then this is certainly the mesh WiFi system for you. It\u2019s fast, reliable, fairly easy to use and I reckon the (cheaper) two-pack will cover all but the biggest of homes.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/tp-link-deco-xe75-review-a-solid-wifi-6e-router-system-that-delivers-more-for-less-123033332.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/tp-link-deco-xe75-review-a-solid-wifi-6e-router-system-that-delivers-more-for-less-123033332.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-22 12:30:33+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "DuckDuckGo's privacy-focused browser is now available for Windows", "description": "<p>DuckDuckGo, the privacy-focused alternative to Google, has been working on its own browser.

This time, it\u2019s real-time. With<em> Final Fantasy XVI</em>, the series\u2019 creators have decided the franchise's future is action-centric and storyline driven. And it\u2019s heavily inspired by epic TV fantasy series. Until now, the Final Fantasy games have never quite had their angry, moody dark moment. With nuanced, occasionally horny characters and often a lot of violence, is this the series\u2019 moody teenager era? The tale of <em>FFXVI</em> is achingly <em>Game of Thrones</em>-y, but sometimes the inspiration is a little on the nose: Dad dies early on? Check. Mysterious wolves? Check. Creepy mother-son relations? Check. While this is a very different kind of game for the series, for those looking for a fantasy adventure with a plot that\u2019s kept me hooked, the 16th Final Fantasy delivers.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/final-fantasy-xvi-review-ps5-140058789.html\"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nest-wifi-pro-review-googles-wifi-6e-mesh-is-more-approachable-than-the-rest-130029818.html\">Google Nest WiFi Pro review</a></h2><h3>This mesh network is more approachable than the rest.</h3><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nest-wifi-pro-review-googles-wifi-6e-mesh-is-more-approachable-than-the-rest-130029818.html\"><figure><img alt=\"TMA\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/a744cad0-10e6-11ee-93f1-16aeba02b5cb\" style=\"height: 405px; width: 675px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Engadget</div></figure></a><p>Google\u2019s WiFi products have always offered an acceptable blend of power, price and performance. The Nest WiFi Pro, the company\u2019s latest flagship, builds on that existing formula by adding WiFi 6E. Part of its appeal is the Google brand, plus the promise of regular free software updates and tight integrations with most of the world\u2019s smart home players. You won\u2019t get into the fundamentals of running a network, but it should appeal to people who want to set up a guest network quickly.

The 1996 original was the very first Mario RPG, made in collaboration with Squaresoft (now Square Enix). It tasks Mario, Bowser, Peach and friends with taking down a mechanical enemy named Smithy and recovering stolen pieces of the Star Road. The remake uses the same art style as modern Mario games.

The new Content Classification Labels are myriad, including mature-rated games, sexual themes, significant profanity or vulgarity, gambling, violent and graphic depictions and, lastly, drugs, intoxication or excessive tobacco use. The ratings apply to both the game and you. For example, if you're playing a mature-rated game, Twitch will automatically label it as such. But, if you're playing an E-rated game and you\u2019re excessively swearing, you must mark your stream as having significant profanity or vulgarity.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitch-replaces-its-mature-content-mode-with-more-granular-labels-100501056.html\"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><h2><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cellular-satellite-test-successfully-beams-4g-data-from-space-to-a-regular-phone-200318927.html\">Cellular satellite test successfully beams 4G data from space to a regular phone</a></h2><h3>AST SpaceMobile recently completed a two-way voice call.</h3><h3></h3><p>Earlier this year, AST SpaceMobile, with the help of AT&amp;T, connected an off-the-shelf Samsung Galaxy S22 to a satellite in low-Earth orbit to complete a two-way voice call.

Satya Nadella Vs. Sundar Pichai would be almost as interesting to see, especially now that Bing has finally become part of the conversation, thanks to its AI chatbot. And then there's Snap CEO Evan Spiegel and Instagram head Adam Mosseri, who can take their mobile-first services' rivalry to the octagon. Since both Musk and Zuckerberg are looking for ways to monetize their platforms, the smart thing to do is to broadcast the event as pay-to-view live streams on Twitter Blue and Meta Verified. Of course, these are imaginary fights that will most likely not happen, but we're expecting a juicy check as thanks for our ideas if they do.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/get-ready-for-a-zuck-vs-musk-cage-fight-100611527.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/get-ready-for-a-zuck-vs-musk-cage-fight-100611527.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-22 10:06:11+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Discord (still) has a child safety issue", "description": "<p>A new report has revealed alarming statistics about Discord's issues with child safety. Over the past six years, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/discord-child-safety-social-platform-challenges-rcna89769\"><em>NBC News</em></a> identified 35 cases of adults being prosecuted on charges of &quot;kidnapping, grooming or sexual assault&quot; that allegedly involved Discord communication. At least 15 of those have resulted in guilty pleas or verdicts, with &quot;many others&quot; still pending.&nbsp;</p><p>Reporters also discovered 165 more cases, including four crime rings, in which adults were prosecuted for sharing CSAM (child sexual exploitation material) via Discord or allegedly using the site to extort children into sending sexually graphic images of themselves, a practice known as sextortion. The illegal acts often take place in hidden communities and chat rooms, according to the report.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>A simple Google search of &quot;site:justice.gov Discord&quot; yields a large number of hits, many of a disturbing nature.

And it's not the first time Discord has been under fire for its handling of child abuse complaints. Last year, <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2022/03/22/tech/discord-teens/index.html\"><em>CNN</em></a> also identified numerous incidents of CSAM, with some parents claiming that Discord offered little help.&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier this year, the National Center on Sexual Exploitation (NCOSE) issued a <a href=\"https://endsexualexploitation.org/articles/discord-dishonestly-responds-to-how-it-handles-child-sexual-abuse-material-after-being-named-to-2023-dirty-dozen-list/\">statement</a> titled &quot;Discord Dishonestly Responds to How it Handles Child Sexual Abuse Material After Being Named to 2023 <a href=\"https://endsexualexploitation.org/Discord/\">Dirty Dozen List</a>.&quot; Among other things, it noted that CSAM links were identified and reported, but still available on Discord's servers &quot;over two weeks later.&quot; It added that Discord's actions in responding to the issues are &quot;far too passive, failing to proactively search for and remove exploitation.&quot; It recommended that the site, which currently has over 150 million users, ban minors &quot;until it is radically transformed.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>In a recent <a href=\"https://discord.com/blog/discord-transparency-report-q4-2022\">transparency report</a>, Discord said its &quot;investment and prioritization in child safety has never been more robust,&quot; adding that it disabled 37,102 accounts and removed 17,425 servers for child safety violations. The company's VP of trust and safety, John Redgrave, told NBC News that he believes the platform's approach to the issue has improved since Discord bought the AI moderation company Sentropy in 2021. It uses several systems to proactively detect CSAM and analyze user behavior, and Redgrave said that he thinks the company now proactively detects most materials that already &quot;identified, verified and indexed.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>However, the systems can't currently detect child sexual abuse materials or messages that have yet to be indexed. In a review of Discord servers created over the past month, <em>NBC News</em> found 242 that use thinly disguised terms to market CSAM.&nbsp;</p><p>Discord isn't the only social media company with CSAM problems. A recent <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/meta-vows-to-take-action-after-report-found-instagrams-algorithm-promoted-pedophilia-content-133343896.html\">report</a> found that Instagram helped &quot;connect and promote a vast network of accounts&quot; devoted to underage-sex content.
