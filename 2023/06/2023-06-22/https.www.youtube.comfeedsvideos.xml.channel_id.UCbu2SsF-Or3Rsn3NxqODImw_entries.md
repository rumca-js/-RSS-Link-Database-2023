In this video we go over techniques such as Pivot Shield Jumping, Shield Block Resets, Keese Orbiting, and more, showing how it can be used in combat to gain the upper hand over your enemies.

Today we're asking Billy Billingham, an ex member of the SAS Special Forces to react to a selection of tactical shooters games, virtual special forces operations as well as tactics in games like Battlefield 3 or Ghost Recon.

Mark “Billy” Billingham served in the British SAS for over 20 years, has been responsible for planning and executing strategic operations across the world, is a certified counter terrorism instructor, has led countless hostage rescues, as well as much more. 

Previously he worked as an A-list bodyguard for Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, and now acts as Chief Instructor on hit show SAS: Who Dares Wins as well as putting celebrities through gruelling challenges in Fox TV's Special Forces: World's Toughest Test. 

But what does he think of Rainbow Six: Siege's SAS members Sledge and Mute? How realistic are the weapons of Escape from Tarkov and the battles of Squad? What does he make of the tactics of Ready or not?
