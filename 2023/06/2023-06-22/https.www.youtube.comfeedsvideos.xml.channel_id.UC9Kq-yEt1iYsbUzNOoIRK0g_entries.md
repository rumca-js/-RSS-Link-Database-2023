The DCEU has never had an easy go over the course of its 10-year existence, with most movies getting slammed by critics. But all that is set to change with the release of The Flash. Just kidding. The Flash dove deep into development hell, with a constant change in directors, writers, and some notably erratic and violent behavior from star Ezra Miller.

The Flash definitely raises some questions. Like was this entire production cursed? Can people handle two Ezra Millers? How many insane events happened in one day in 2013? Did Barry learn a lesson at the end of this or not? How many cameos can they shove into this thing? What was with that CGI?

To answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to The Flash!
