Previously a marginal figure in the world of pop \u2013 she attracted a degree of notoriety for 2022\u2019s spectacularly potty-mouthed EP Slut Pop \u2013 she was catapulted into mainstream consciousness when she appeared on Sam Smith\u2019s global chart-topper Unholy. It made Petras the first openly transgender artist to have a US No 1 and the first trans artist to win a major category Grammy. There followed other markers of the German pop star\u2019s newfound celebrity. In May, she appeared on the red carpet at the Met Gala, clad in Marc Jacobs, and was announced as one of four cover models for Sports Illustrated\u2019s annual swimsuit issue.</p><p>If only the music on her major label debut album was as interesting and innovative as its author is, or even as diverting as Unholy, the gothic theatricality of which sounded markedly different to any other recent No 1. It\u2019s tacked on to the end of Feed the Beast, but its presence only serves to underline that there\u2019s nothing else like it here either. Instead, the album occasionally lunges towards some well-worn current pop trends. The clipped 80s sound familiar from the Weeknd\u2019s Blinding Lights and subsequent hits including Ed Sheeran\u2019s Bad Habits and Harry Styles\u2019 As It Was gets another airing on Minute.

Isn\u2019t that enough?</p><p>The second season of And Just Like That, HBO\u2019s controversial, heavily criticised Sex and the City revival, manages to do the unthinkable: it is even more lavish and unreservedly ridiculous than its first go-around. Here is just a small sample of some of the more daft things that happen in its first seven episodes: Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and Lisa (Nicole Ari Parker) lust after a student at their children\u2019s school; Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) spends a scene mulling over the word \u201cjizz\u201d; Seema (Sarita Choudhury) dates a guy who uses a penis pump; Who\u2019s The Boss? star Tony Danza has an extended cameo as himself, in which he worries he will get cancelled for appearing in Che Diaz\u2019s (Sara Ramirez) sitcom pilot. And that barely scratches the surface of all the ludicrous high jinks Carrie and co get up to this season. It would seem that the showrunner, Michael Patrick King, having seen all the memes about its (often unintentionally) hilarious first season, has decided to plunge head-first into unfettered bonkersness. And the show is all the better for it.</p><p>Much of the criticism of And Just Like That\u2019s first season centred on the ungainliness of it all: early episodes groaned under the weight of 10 years\u2019 worth of exposition, plot points were introduced and abandoned with impunity, and the show\u2019s discussion of gender and racism was deemed clunky and out of character. I don\u2019t necessarily agree with the last gripe \u2013 the well-meaning but out-of-touch way Carrie, Charlotte and Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) discussed, say, transgender issues or Black Lives Matter, reminded me of the way my extended family would discuss these subjects \u2013 but both criticisms have largely been dealt with this time. Che is no longer a walking, talking infographic, and Miranda no longer sounds as if she is reciting sections of the book White Fragility from memory.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/22/and-just-like-that-season-two-review-a-lavish-ridiculous-and-hilarious-meme-fest\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/22/and-just-like-that-season-two-review-a-lavish-ridiculous-and-hilarious-meme-fest", "date_published": "2023-06-22 21:00:19+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Tech firms to be forced to hand over data to inquests into child deaths", "description": "<p>Bereaved families welcome online safety bill amendment that hands greater powers to coroners</p><p>Ofcom will be able to force tech platforms to hand over the personal data of children whose deaths are suspected to be related to online harm, the government has confirmed.</p><p>On the last day of the online safety bill\u2019s passage through parliament, the government accepted an amendment backed by a group of bereaved parents that will give coroners the power through Ofcom to force cooperation when investigating the deaths of children.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/22/ofcom-to-get-powers-to-obtain-childrens-data-for-coroners-in-online-safety-cases\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/22/ofcom-to-get-powers-to-obtain-childrens-data-for-coroners-in-online-safety-cases", "date_published": "2023-06-22 20:15:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Two debut books win Orwell prizes for political writing", "description": "<p>Peter Apps\u2019 magnificent account of the Grenfell fire tragedy and Tom Crewe\u2019s historical novel about pioneering Victorian gay rights advocates will each receive \u00a33,000</p><p>A \u201cmagnificent\u201d and \u201cforensic\u201d account of the policy decisions leading up to the Grenfell Tower fire, Show Me the Bodies: How We Let Grenfell Happen by Peter Apps, has won the 2023 Orwell prize for political writing.

Sea temperatures, particularly off the north-east coast of England and the west of Ireland, are several degrees above normal, breaking records for late spring and early summer. The Met Office has said that according to records dating to 1850, global sea surface temperatures in April and May reached an all-time high, and June is likely to follow suit. A professor of earth sciences, Daniela Schmidt, said 'the extreme and unprecedented temperatures show the power of the combination of human-induced warming and natural climate variability like El Ni\u00f1o'. Experts said marine heatwaves have a similar impact on the environment as wildfires on land, destroying organisms that store carbon such as kelp. The damage caused is also harmful to humanity, which relies on oceans for oxygen, storm protection and food.</p><p></p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/19/marine-heatwave-uk-irish-coasts-threat-oysters-fish-high-temperatures\">\u2018Unheard of\u2019 marine heatwave off UK and Irish coasts poses serious threat</a></p></li></ul> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2023/jun/22/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-extreme-heatwave-hitting-our-oceans-video-explainer\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2023/jun/22/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-extreme-heatwave-hitting-our-oceans-video-explainer", "date_published": "2023-06-22 14:22:05+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "More than 160 people rescued from boats near Canary Islands", "description": "<p>Rescues come as refugee charities say more than 30 people may have died after dinghy sank on same route this week</p><p>Emergency services say 168 people have been rescued near Spain\u2019s Canary Islands, one day after refugee charities said they feared more than 30 people had died after their inflatable dinghy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/21/deaths-dinghy-sinks-canary-islands-spain\">sank on the same route</a>.</p><p>The Canary Islands, off the coast of west Africa, have become the main destination for refugees and migrants trying to reach Spain, with a much smaller number also seeking to cross the Mediterranean Sea to the Spanish mainland.
