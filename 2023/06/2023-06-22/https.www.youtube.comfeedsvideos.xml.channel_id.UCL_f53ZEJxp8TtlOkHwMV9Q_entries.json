Peterson, Tammy Peterson, and Tamara Lich break down the events leading up to, during, and after the internationally recognized Canadian Freedom Convoy, which sought to publicize and end ridiculous COVID mandates as they heavily affected the multi-national trucking industry. Lich was a key organizer and has suffered for her role, spending a total of 48 days in jail over \u201cmischief,\u201d while being labeled a terrorist and being legally barred from using social media. \n\nTamara Lich is a Canadian activist with a background organizing the 2018-2019 Yellow Vest protests in Alberta. She was also an early founder of the secession movement in western Canada known as WEXIT. Lich also had a prior career in the logistics field regarding Canadian energy and first became vocal about the unrivaled efficiency of her country\u2019s fossil fuel industry, despite the mainstream media claiming otherwise.\n\nDr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8\n\nEp.369\n\n\n- Sponsors - \n\nElysium: Get $50 off an Index test!
