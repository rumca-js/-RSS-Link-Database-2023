## Kim Petras: Feed the Beast review  | Alexis Petridis's album of the week

<p><strong>(Island)</strong><br />Lurching between well-worn current chart trends and 90s European pop-dance with flimsy melodies and frightful lyrics, Petras and her songwriters all miss the mark</p><p>These are high times for Kim Petras. Previously a marginal figure in the world of pop – she attracted a degree of notoriety for 2022’s spectacularly potty-mouthed EP Slut Pop – she was catapulted into mainstream consciousness when she appeared on Sam Smith’s global chart-topper Unholy. It made Petras the first openly transgender artist to have a US No 1 and the first trans artist to win a major category Grammy. There followed other markers of the German pop star’s newfound celebrity. In May, she appeared on the red carpet at the Met Gala, clad in Marc Jacobs, and was announced as one of four cover models for Sports Illustrated’s annual swimsuit issue.</p><p>If only the music on her major label debut album was as interesting and innovative as its author is, or even as diverting as Unholy, the gothic theatricality of which sounded markedly different to any other recent No 1. It’s tacked on to the end of Feed the Beast, but its presence only serves to underline that there’s nothing else like it here either. Instead, the album occasionally lunges towards some well-worn current pop trends. The clipped 80s sound familiar from the Weeknd’s Blinding Lights and subsequent hits including Ed Sheeran’s Bad Habits and Harry Styles’ As It Was gets another airing on Minute. Alone, meanwhile, fits with the vogue for borrowing huge chunks of immediately recognisable old hits by sticking a trap beat under Alice Deejay’s pop-trance smash Better Off Alone, a trick already pulled on Wiz Khalifa’s 2008 single Say Yeah.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/23/kim-petras-feed-the-beast-review">Continue reading...</a>

## And Just Like That season two review – a lavish, ridiculous and hilarious meme-fest

<p>It will never live up to Sex and the City, but it’s intensely quotable, brilliantly watchable and packed with hilarious high jinks. Isn’t that enough?</p><p>The second season of And Just Like That, HBO’s controversial, heavily criticised Sex and the City revival, manages to do the unthinkable: it is even more lavish and unreservedly ridiculous than its first go-around. Here is just a small sample of some of the more daft things that happen in its first seven episodes: Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and Lisa (Nicole Ari Parker) lust after a student at their children’s school; Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) spends a scene mulling over the word “jizz”; Seema (Sarita Choudhury) dates a guy who uses a penis pump; Who’s The Boss? star Tony Danza has an extended cameo as himself, in which he worries he will get cancelled for appearing in Che Diaz’s (Sara Ramirez) sitcom pilot. And that barely scratches the surface of all the ludicrous high jinks Carrie and co get up to this season. It would seem that the showrunner, Michael Patrick King, having seen all the memes about its (often unintentionally) hilarious first season, has decided to plunge head-first into unfettered bonkersness. And the show is all the better for it.</p><p>Much of the criticism of And Just Like That’s first season centred on the ungainliness of it all: early episodes groaned under the weight of 10 years’ worth of exposition, plot points were introduced and abandoned with impunity, and the show’s discussion of gender and racism was deemed clunky and out of character. I don’t necessarily agree with the last gripe – the well-meaning but out-of-touch way Carrie, Charlotte and Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) discussed, say, transgender issues or Black Lives Matter, reminded me of the way my extended family would discuss these subjects – but both criticisms have largely been dealt with this time. Che is no longer a walking, talking infographic, and Miranda no longer sounds as if she is reciting sections of the book White Fragility from memory.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/22/and-just-like-that-season-two-review-a-lavish-ridiculous-and-hilarious-meme-fest">Continue reading...</a>

## Windrush: Portraits of a Generation review – don’t let this documentary distract from our national shame

The approach that began under Theresa May in 2012 became a scandal and led to the resignation of Rudd as home secretary and a pledge from the government to reform the Home Office to ensure it could never happen again. But the past six months have seen Suella Braverman dropping key commitments, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/19/unit-reforming-home-office-windrush-scandal-being-disbanded">the Home Office unit responsible for reforms has been quietly disbanded</a>, just in time for the 75th anniversary of Empire Windrush’s arrival in Tilbury.</p><p>There is plenty to admire in Windrush: Portraits of a Generation, which follows 10 fascinating and inspiring members of the Windrush generation having their portraits commissioned by Buckingham Palace – and created by 10 different artists.

## Don’t worry about inflation, folks – Rish! is 100% not on it | John Crace

<p>Sunak’s claims that he can fix everything make him sound like a dodgy boyfriend – is he serious?</p><p>If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, the chances are it’s probably a duck. Ever since Rishi Sunak became prime minister, he and his team have been trying to sell him to the country as a different kind of politician. The type of leader who gets things done. Who makes promises and keeps them. Is straightforward with people about the challenges ahead. The Goldman Sachs tech bro who is effortlessly competent. The safest of safe pairs of hands.</p><p>Almost as if Rish! is on a mission to stop us thinking for ourselves. Because the longer it goes on, the clearer it becomes he is trying to gaslight us. There’s only so much cognitive dissonance anyone can take. Trying to persuade yourself that someone who is demonstrably a bit hopeless is some kind of new-age statesman eventually becomes an impossibility. You have to accept the evidence of your own eyes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/22/rishi-sunak-inflation-100-not-on-it">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Paris conference shows the climate crisis is no time for the tranquillising drug of gradualism</p><p>The International Energy Agency in 2021 had an unambiguous <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/18/no-new-investment-in-fossil-fuels-demands-top-energy-economist" title="">message</a>: developing new fossil fuel resources is incompatible with restricting global heating to below 1.5C, a threshold beyond which the most disastrous climate impacts lie. Yet the oil and gas industry isn’t listening. Last year it committed <a href="https://www.ief.org/focus/ief-reports/upstream-investment-report-2023" title="">half a trillion dollars</a> for new capital expenditure on future drilling and extraction, while making outrageous profits of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/oil-gas-industry-earned-4-trillion-last-year-says-iea-chief-2023-02-14/" title="">$4tn</a>. Business as usual will destroy life as we know it.</p><p>Energy is fundamental for development and meeting basic needs. But producing it from coal, oil and gas is simultaneously the cause of the climate emergency. Clearly the issues of climate, energy and development must be addressed in an interconnected way. This is very difficult against a post-Covid backdrop when poor nations have record levels of debt. In the wake of the Ukraine invasion, rising interest rates have caused the dollar to surge – raising the cost of meeting loan repayments which are often denominated in the US currency. African nations spend up to <a href="https://qz.com/africa/1848047/nigeria-kenya-ghana-spend-twice-more-debt-payment-than-health" title="">five times </a>their health budgets on debt obligations.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/22/the-guardian-view-on-macrons-green-finance-deal-save-lives-not-profits">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The best of the festival can often be found on smaller stages away from the headliners that attract TV audiences</p><p>More than 200,000 people will head for Worthy Farm in Somerset this weekend for the 2023 Glastonbury festival. Since 1970, when<a href="https://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/history/history-1970/" title=""> tickets cost £1</a> (including a pint of milk), it has grown to become<a href="https://www.visitbritain.com/en/things-to-do/music-and-festivals#:~:text=Glastonbury,biggest%20festival%20is%20Glastonbury%20Festival%20." title=""> the UK’s largest festival</a> and a rite of passage for music lovers. Despite its sometimes otherworldly appearance, Glastonbury (of which the Guardian is a longstanding media partner) is not immune to the cost of living crisis. Since organisers put up a “super fence” in the early 2000s as a condition of keeping its licence, changing its nature but securing its future, it has faced ever-rising costs.</p><p>In pre-pandemic 2019, the last time tickets went on sale, they cost £265; this year they have risen to £335. The co-organiser Emily Eavis has cited the knock-on effects of cancelling two festivals during Covid. In contrast with other more corporate events, Glastonbury offers free tickets for children and works with food vendors on affordable options – but even so, there are fears that younger music lovers could end up <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/oct/18/glastonbury-2023-ticket-prices" title="">priced out</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/22/the-guardian-view-on-glastonburys-enduring-appeal-a-show-like-no-other">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The speculated bid price of £8 today should not excite those who think a return to £28 is conceivable</p><p>It is still a little premature to launch a campaign to save Ocado for the nation and keep it out of the clammy hands of Amazon.

The stock market, where <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/22/ocado-shares-soar-takeover-rumours">Ocado’s shares soared 32%</a>, may have misread the plot. But there’s no harm in getting in early. If it comes to it, one hopes Tim Steiner, Ocado’s chief executive, tells the Amazonians to get stuffed.</p><p>Admittedly, Ocado has been a jam-tomorrow story for most of its 13, mostly loss-making, years as a public company. There was a hurrah, and excited talk about “the Microsoft of retail”, when, from 2018, deals started to be signed with overseas food retailers to supply robots, warehouses and online expertise. And there was a bigger hurrah when the pandemic inflated the values of everything techie. Ocado’s shares flew as high as £28.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/jun/22/true-believers-in-ocado-should-not-be-tempted-by-amazon">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The debate over what is appropriate for children is important, but it has been co-opted at protests using abusive tactics</p><p>Drag and cross-dressing have been a part of British cultural expression for centuries. From Shakespeare plays to pantomime dames, and the late Barry Humphries’ creation Dame Edna Everage; playing with representations of gender in all its forms has long been widely enjoyed by audiences. Drag shows are a modern expression of this tradition, which is now being threatened by a coordinated campaign to silence it.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/22/tory-mps-contributing-to-growing-hostility-to-drag-events-report-says">More than 50 family drag events</a> in the UK were targeted by protesters from June last year to this May, according to <a href="https://www.isdglobal.org/isd-publications/a-year-of-hate-anti-drag-mobilisation-efforts-targeting-lgbtq-people-in-the-uk/">data</a> gathered by our researchers at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD). Ten shows were cancelled or postponed before they even took place. At the ones that did go ahead, small groups (rarely more than 12) using abusive and confrontational tactics routinely accused parents who were taking their children to the events of supporting paedophilia, or threatened to perform “citizen’s arrests” on the drag queens performing at them. Clashes between protesters and counter protesters or police broke out at a number of them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/22/british-extremists-us-right-family-drag-shows-children">Continue reading...</a>

Scottish politician whose 1967 byelection triumph in Hamilton heralded a breakthrough for the SNP<p>The politician Winifred Ewing, who has died aged 93, was the most remarkable vote-winner in modern Scottish politics. Her triumph at the Hamilton byelection in 1967 heralded the breakthrough of the Scottish National party as a serious electoral force; later in her career she retired undefeated from the European parliament after four terms as MEP for the Highlands and Islands.</p><p>She then concluded a unique treble by becoming a founding member of the devolved Scottish parliament when it was established in 1999 and indeed, as the oldest MSP, took the chair at its first session before a presiding officer had been elected. She drew on her experience to call for the new body to “follow the more consensual style of the European parliament and say goodbye to the badgering and backbiting that one associates with Westminster”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/22/winifred-ewing-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

Over the years, he seems to have moved away from club-based music in favour of a more organic, human sound. It’s been almost 20 years since the creation of Border Community and this album is a celebration of that. Each track feels like a nod to parts of his previous discography. The percussion on most tracks is very faint and makes the album feel like a lost memory. The only track where the beat hits with a thud is Worlds Collide Mountains Form, which sounds like a band playing by the fire, feeding off each other in a trance-like state.

## As a martial arts veteran, I know Zuckerberg could take Musk in a fight. But what a waste of energy! | Joel Snape

<p>Meta and Twitter’s bosses are squaring up online. But while they bang on about cage fights, the world is burning</p><p>Are Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg going to have a cage fight? Of course they aren’t. In case you missed this story, Zuckerberg’s company, Meta, recently released plans for a Twitter-like app; Musk responded to tweets about it by saying that he was “up for a cage fight” with the Facebook founder; Zuck shot back with <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=send+location+meme&amp;rlz=1C5GCEM_enGB998GB1005&amp;sxsrf=APwXEdfyvCtnowUIHuHzqGkbpsxsgeaIWg%3A1687436391540&amp;ei=ZzyUZNfIIPyFhbIPzfuSwAQ&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiXmMu17tb_AhX8QkEAHc29BEgQ4dUDCA8&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=send+location+meme&amp;gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQAzIFCAAQgAQyBggAEBYQHjIGCAAQFhAeMgYIABAWEB4yBggAEBYQHjIGCAAQFhAeMgYIABAWEB4yBggAEBYQHjIICAAQigUQhgMyCAgAEIoFEIYDOgoIABBHENYEELADOgUILhCABDoECCMQJzoICAAQigUQkQI6CAgAEBYQHhAPOgcIABANEIAEOggIABAIEB4QDUoECEEYAFCBB1ixGmDoG2gGcAF4AIABW4gB5wWSAQIxMJgBAKABAcABAcgBCA&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp">a meme that only Ultimate Fighting Championship fans</a> will actually get; and the world continues to turn/get hotter. The only thing you <em>really</em> need to understand about this affair is that two men who shouldn’t have GSOH anywhere near their potential dating profile tried to make some funnies, and everyone else joined in the battle royale for attention. Did I mention that it’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/15/record-temperatures-global-heating">really hot outside?</a></p><p>Anyway. On the surface, this story probably reflects better on Zuck than Musk: the former, after all, actually practises mixed martial arts (MMA), and recently competed in a Brazilian jiu-jitsu tournament where he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/08/facebook-founder-mark-zuckerberg-jiu-jiutsu">won a brace of medals</a>. As a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_Pq-Jv5kt8&amp;t=54s">two-decade BJJ bro</a> with a handful of amateur MMA fights under my own (black) belt, I know how difficult that is. Even if you’re hiring the best coaches in the world, you still have to do the work to get better, and there is (I’m assuming) no level of wealth that makes it feel better when another man grinds his shoulder into your face.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/22/mark-zuckerberg-elon-musk-mma-cage-fighting">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Benjamin Appl/James Baillieu<br />(Alpha)<br /></strong>Sustaining intensity with even the tiniest sound, Appl’s baritone is velvety smooth, supported by Baillieu’s responsive piano at every turn</p><p>Perhaps it was all the puns about his name: the latest disc from the baritone <a href="https://www.benjaminappl.de/">Benjamin Appl</a> is a kind of concept album centring around the idea of eating the forbidden fruit, and the consequences thereof. <a href="https://james-baillieu.com/">James Baillieu</a>’s responsive, detailed piano playing supports him at every turn in bringing these songs to life.</p><p>The programme ranges widely – 19th-century Lieder, Jake Heggie, Poulenc, Marlene Dietrich being Just a Gigolo. It begins with a folk song and ends with Mahler’s Urlicht, but its core (that’s enough now) is bookended by two iterations of a gossamer piano solo version of In Paradisum from Fauré’s Requiem, and Appl intersperses the songs with brief spoken phrases from the Book of Genesis. The religious theme is a bit of a fig leaf, though: at times Appl’s delivery of those phrases is a bit tongue-in-cheek, and the bulk of the songs are concerned with decidedly unholy ideas – seduction, transgression, regret, the latter being voiced most urgently in The Ballad of Paragraph 218, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanns_Eisler">Eisler</a> and Brecht’s biting take-down of anti-abortion laws in Weimar Germany.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/22/forbidden-fruit-review-benjamin-appl-james-bailieu-erica-jeal">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Scientists have warned a marine heatwave off the coasts of the UK and Ireland poses a serious threat to species. Sea temperatures, particularly off the north-east coast of England and the west of Ireland, are several degrees above normal, breaking records for late spring and early summer. The Met Office has said that according to records dating to 1850, global sea surface temperatures in April and May reached an all-time high, and June is likely to follow suit. A professor of earth sciences, Daniela Schmidt, said 'the extreme and unprecedented temperatures show the power of the combination of human-induced warming and natural climate variability like El Niño'. Experts said marine heatwaves have a similar impact on the environment as wildfires on land, destroying organisms that store carbon such as kelp. The damage caused is also harmful to humanity, which relies on oceans for oxygen, storm protection and food.</p><p></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/19/marine-heatwave-uk-irish-coasts-threat-oysters-fish-high-temperatures">‘Unheard of’ marine heatwave off UK and Irish coasts poses serious threat</a></p></li></ul> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2023/jun/22/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-extreme-heatwave-hitting-our-oceans-video-explainer">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Duke of York’s, London</strong> <br />In this revival of Martin McDonagh’s play about child mutilation, tyranny and freedom of expression, the twists and turns between comic and macabre sadly do not come off</p><p>Lily Allen’s star casting worked wonders for the West End run of ghost story 2:22. But The Pillowman, Martin McDonagh’s 2003 play about child mutilation, state tyranny and freedom of expression (this production is partnered with PEN International), is a very different kind of gothic horror. Cerebral and slippery, it requires an accomplished actor to navigate its odd structure and changes of tone that slide between horror and humour, with punchlines tucked in between tales of children buried alive or attacked with drills.</p><p>Allen does not meet the challenge. The singer turned actor plays Katurian, a writer held prisoner in a police state reminiscent of a 1970s eastern bloc country, awaiting execution without trial, with her brother Michal (Matthew Tennyson, bringing eerie energy) arrested in the next room. She has written stories featuring eye-watering murders and mutilations that are being enacted by a copycat killer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/22/the-pillowman-review-duke-of-yorks-london-lily-allen-martin-mcdonagh">Continue reading...</a>

In the first days after the news broke, she says, people and institutions were too afraid to speak up. “No one did anything quick enough, it was really ugly,” the London-based artist recalls. “I was like: ‘I can’t watch this. I can’t not say anything and carry on like this is OK.’”</p><p>In response, Minott created <a href="https://zinziminott.com/works/fi-dem-i/">Fi Dem</a>, a six-minute film that splices archival footage from the arrival of the Empire Windrush with home videos of her family.

<p>With two films due for release, the Scottish actor answers your questions about Logan Roy’s demise, his ever-expanding wardrobe and switching his support from Labour to the SNP</p><p><strong>I recently read your autobiography, which I enjoyed a lot. You’re refreshingly honest – and critical – about other actors and styles of acting. Did you have any qualms? </strong><em>Thelonious<br /></em>I don’t have any qualms talking honestly and directly. It’s horses for courses with acting. Each actor has their own style, approach and attitude. My view is that acting is a much simpler thing than a lot of people make out. It’s not as heavy handed as some people believe it is. I believe that actors are transmitters, that things come through them, and that’s what we have to allow so we don’t overload. When I read the book again, I did have slight qualms. I thought: “Maybe I’m being a bit too harsh.” Then I thought: “No, I’m not.” I’m at an age now where I can say what I feel and believe, and that’s brilliant. But I don’t really diss any actors in my book.</p><p><strong>Your on-screen persona is often terrifying. Would you like to be cast as a romantic lead? </strong><em>Mazzini<br /></em>Absolutely!

Almost a year before, a blood-soaked India slipped out of the orbit of the British empire, gaining its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2022/aug/15/india-75-years-independence-in-pictures">independence</a>. A year after Windrush, in October 1949, the Chinese Communist party won the long civil war, establishing primacy over Chinese affairs. Three-quarters of a century later, these two countries are producing seismic transformations that are slowly, suddenly unravelling the dominant 500-year transatlantic global order.</p><p>Sandwiched between these two event colossi, Windrush would seem on the surface to measure poorly against its age-mates. But the celebrations beginning on Thursday, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/03/windrush-75th-anniversary-is-diamond-jubilee-for-britain-say-campaigners">Windrush Day</a>, will highlight two aspects of its impact. First, the arrival of a group of 500 people from the Caribbean, which signalled the beginning of mass migration to the UK from the colonies. And second, that migration’s knock-on effect of unleashing a multiracial society that, 75 years later, has so transformed these islands that we now have a prime minister of Indian descent by way of Africa, and Scotland’s first minister and Labour leader both of Pakistani heritage.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/22/windrush-global-story-hope-future-britain-multiracial">Continue reading...</a>

## It’s a Padam-ic! Kylie’s sex-positive hit is brilliantly upending the mainstream

<p>Not only is she queering the female pop ideal as a rare middle-aged woman in the Radio 1 playlist, Kylie Minogue is also resonating at a time when frivolity is returning to culture</p><p>Just two days ago, a spokesperson for BBC Radio 1 was explaining why <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/kylieminogue">Kylie Minogue</a>’s Padam Padam hadn’t made its playlist, despite the writhing electropop song being her first Top 10 single in 12 years and now bordering on a national obsession. (Last week, it even made it into Hansard, referenced by Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle in a speech about Pride: “And finally Mr Deputy Speaker, in the words of Kylie, <em>padam.</em>”) “Each track is considered for the playlist based on its musical merit and whether it is right for our target audience, with decisions made on a case-by-case basis,” the spokesperson said.</p><p>Kylie turned 55 last month, leading to accusations of ageism against Radio 1. In response, the station claimed that “an artist’s age is never a factor” in decision-making. Technically, that bears out – David Guetta is a perpetual figure on the station, currently on the C-list with Baby Don’t Hurt Me, and he’s also 55. But Guetta is a fairly faceless dance producer. The stakes are evidently different for women whose appearance and physique contribute to an overall performance of pop in which the suggestion of desirability is key. As culture perceives women to become less attractive and sexually viable as they hit middle age, the assumption is clearly that an older female artist is of little relevance to Radio 1’s demographic of listeners aged 15-29, even if – or perhaps specifically because – she’s singing about a dancefloor infatuation so delirious that she and the song’s intended have to go straight home “and take off all my clothes”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/22/its-a-padam-ic-kylie-minogue-sex-positive-hit-brilliantly-upending-the-mainstream">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Looe Island is a case study in how to boost biodiversity, a place where the wardens, Claire Lewis and her partner, Jon Ross, are the only residents, alongside gulls, godwits and comma butterflies</p><p>With its driftwood, capsized boat and crystal-clear waters, Looe Island looks more like a scene from Robinson Crusoe than the well-trodden coastline of Cornwall. Few realise that only a mile from Looe – a seaside town whose narrow streets spill over with tourists in the summer months – there is a wildlife sanctuary.</p><p>In Cornwall’s only marine nature reserve, birds nest in thickets of trees, sheep graze grassy slopes and seals seek refuge in the island’s rocky bays. Quiet and tranquil, Looe Island is nearly deserted – apart from two wildlife wardens whose job it is to care for the land so its biodiversity flourishes.</p><p>Coastal grassland on the island.

## Slapped on to tables, thrown over hedges, bounced – why is everyone so horrible to dead cats? |  Adrian Chiles

<p>There’s something about a recently deceased moggie that excites the imagination. And not in a good way</p><p>If you found a dead cat at the bottom of your garden, what would you do with it? This question has been on my mind ever since I met a vicar who told me that he knew a broadcaster of a Christian persuasion with whom I was acquainted. When I mentioned this man of the cloth to the presenter in question, he said, “Oh yes, he’s a bit of a dead cat vicar.” My quizzical look prompted him to expand: “As in a bit hopeless, so gets moved from parish to parish, like if you find a dead cat in your garden – you just throw it over the fence and make it your neighbour’s problem.”</p><p>I was amazed by the sheer economy of this notion’s unpleasantness, with so few words used to convey disrespect for the deceased cat, the neighbour and the poor vicar himself, who had seemed rather nice to me. Perhaps concision in all things is a Christian virtue.</p><p>Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/22/slapped-on-to-tables-thrown-over-hedges-bounced-why-is-everyone-so-horrible-to-dead-cats">Continue reading...</a>

## The Bathysphere Book by Brad Fox review – mysteries of the deep

<p>The story of an early deep-sea voyage and the strange world it uncovered</p><p>Among my favourite mysteries of the natural world is <em>Bathysphaera intacta</em>, a 6ft fish said to resemble a large barracuda. The new species was supposedly spotted by the explorer and naturalist William Beebe in 1932 at a depth of 640 metres (2100 ft) off the coast of Nonsuch Island in the Bermuda archipelago. We have no photograph of the fish and the only image that exists was drawn by Else Bostelmann, a German-born American artist, who accompanied Beebe on his expedition. Bostelmann never descended into the ocean’s depths; her drawings, based on Beebe’s descriptions, are 20th-century marine equivalents of Dürer’s Rhinoceros, creatures that the artist had never seen first-hand.</p><p>Fans of Dürer’s woodcut will enjoy Brad Fox’s The Bathysphere Book. It is an alternative history of Beebe’s exploration of the deep ocean, a weird and often beautiful fusion of science writing, history and poetry that explores our own relationship with the unknown – how we make sense of something fundamentally new with the limited tools at our disposal. It’s a story largely set in the Bermuda archipelago in the 1930s, but it somehow seems more ancient than that; Fox’s protagonists resemble literary trespassers into the underworld, frustrated by the limits of human language and anxious that their experiences will be misunderstood or dismissed by those on the surface.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/22/the-bathysphere-book-by-brad-fox-review-mysteries-of-the-deep">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The first new non-3D instalment for a decade, due for release on Switch in October, will introduce the Wonder Flower, a four-player co-op feature – and Mario will be able to turn into an elephant</p><p>There have been rumours circulating for a while that a new 2D instalment in the Super Mario series was afoot – but perhaps no one expected a game in which the titular plumber could transform into an elephant and bounce on spherical hippos. That’s exactly what we’re getting, however, courtesy of Super Mario Bros Wonder, the first new non-3D Super Mario instalment for a decade, and the highlight of Nintendo’s latest Direct showcase streamed live on Wednesday evening.</p><p>Due for release on Switch on 20 October, Wonder is being billed as “the next evolution of 2D side-scrolling”. Ostensibly, it looks like a modernised take on the classic Super Nintendo-era games, with its bright, brash landscape, familiar Koopa enemies, and green pipes, but the game is introducing a new Wonder Flower, which, when touched, causes changes in the game world, including pipes coming alive and wriggling around and enemies bombarding the screen or mutating into new forms. Players will also be able to control Princess Peach, Princess Daisy and Yoshi as well as Mario who is now able to turn into an elephant. Local four-player co-op is another welcome feature.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jun/22/super-mario-leaps-back-to-2d-as-nintendo-goes-retro">Continue reading...</a>

## Football transfer rumours: Newcastle to sign Rúben Neves and Sadio Mané?

<p>Today’s tittle-tattle is southern fried</p><p>As far as transfer strategies go, <strong>Newcastle </strong>snatching <strong>Rúben Neves </strong>on a two-year loan deal would be a shrewd if controversial move. The Portuguese midfielder has only just left Wolves after a seven-year shift with the ink barely dry on his £47 million contract with <strong>Al-Hilal </strong>in the Saudi Professional League. It’s not that<strong> </strong>Eddie Howe<strong> </strong>has convinced the Saudi club to tear up the legal document. He may not have to; both Newcastle and Al-Hilal are owned by PIF, the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia.</p><p>The Magpies are also closing in on a move for <strong>Milan’s Sandro Tonali</strong>, the 23-year-old midfielder with a £60m price tag. Negotiations stalled after an initial £50m bid was rejected but the move now looks secure and would match the club’s record signing of Alexander Isak, who joined from Real Sociedad last season. Newcastle could bolster their Champions League squad further still with a move for <strong>Sadio Mané</strong>, who has been deemed surplus to requirements by Bayern Munich.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/22/football-transfer-rumours-newcastle-ruben-neves-sadio-mane">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘We’ll play until our teeth drop out!’ The long, remarkable lives of Britain’s Windrush-era musicians

<p>Now in their 80s and 90s, having faced down racism and neglect, musicians of Caribbean heritage are still centre stage in the adopted country where they’ve enriched music in so many ways</p><p>When the Empire Windrush docked at Tilbury in 1948, passengers disembarking included Trinidadian calypsonians Lord Beginner, Lord Woodbine, Monica Baptiste and Lord Kitchener, the latter serenading the Pathé News film crew with an a cappella version of his song London Is the Place For Me. Until the Commonwealth Immigrant Acts (1962, 1968, 1971) produced a hostile environment for Caribbean nationals wanting to emigrate, many West Indian musicians would follow them, introducing everything from ska to soca. A handful of them would achieve international success; others would be broken by their experiences. Most were overlooked and would endure many privations, but they all enriched British music in myriad ways.</p><p>“I suppose we made some kind of impact,” says the self-effacing Michael “Bami” Rose as he reflects on their legacy ahead of this week’s Windrush 75 commemorations. Bami is preparing for tonight’s residency at Brixton’s Effra Tavern with Jamaican Jazz, an ensemble formed in the early 1990s that paired veterans – Rose, the late trombonist Rico Rodriquez, percussionist Tony Uter, trumpeter Eddie “Tan-Tan” Thornton – with younger Black British players. Rodriquez died in 2015 and Thornton is ailing, but Rose and Uter, 80 and 94, respectively, continue to lead a dynamic outfit. “Musicians play until their teeth drop out!”, Rose says.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/22/well-play-until-our-teeth-drop-out-the-long-remarkable-lives-of-britains-windrush-era-musicians">Continue reading...</a>

Then I tried to sit down and write that earnest book, and it wasn’t emerging.”</p><p>For years, he says: “I’d overprojected value, even humanity, on the great writers, forgetting the greatness of the books that I’ve read and loved.

<p>In his second novel, set in a fictional Caribbean country, the British Ghanian author pays homage to the staying power of migrant communities</p><p>The new novel by British Ghanaian author and performance poet <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/nii-ayikwei-parkes">Nii Ayikwei Parkes</a> is set in a fictional Caribbean country called Fumaz, an island nation whose history is strikingly similar to that of Cuba. It has been under a US trade embargo ever since a leftwing revolution in 1959, and was for many years economically dependent on sugar exports to communist Russia; the collapse of the USSR in 1991 plunged the islanders into severe hardship. The primary protagonist, Yunior, is a talented crop scientist hired by the Fumaz government in the mid-90s to help diversify their agriculture. The novel recounts his early life as a child migrant from Ghana, his musical exploits with a popular salsa band, and his ill-fated romance with a local police officer. A second, parallel narrative concerns Emelina, the US-raised heiress of a wealthy Fumaz rice merchant, who leaves the North American “Sun Coast” (read: Miami) for her ancestral homeland when she inherits her grandfather’s estate.</p><p>Yunior’s life revolves around his twin passions: music and nature. When he isn’t playing guitar he is tending to his allotment: “Rotating peppers, spring onions, tomatoes, sweet potatoes and cabbages with assorted frijoles, okra … he prided himself on a garden that was both colourful and nutritious.” These two themes are often intertwined in the novel’s descriptive language: “Through [music] he blended with the countryside – its fertility, its undulating earth, its cycles, the muted music of its flora flourishing and fading, its temper when hurricanes flashed by.” On stage, he “oscillates his guitar in a pattern that mirrors the map-making loops of honey bees that have found nectar in a far flung patch of petals”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/22/azucar-by-nii-ayikwei-parkes-review-a-honey-sweet-fable">Continue reading...</a>

## The Diary of Virginia Woolf review – a book for the ages

<p>Woolf’s epic and unmatchable record of her life, times and writing process</p><p>“I meant to write about death, only life came breaking in as usual,” Virginia Woolf wrote on 17 February 1922, when she had just turned 40. Her diary is full of pain: deaths, losses, illness, grief, depression, anguish, fear. But on every page life breaks in, with astonishing energy, relish and glee. The diary is an unmatchable record of her times, a gallery of vividly observed individuals, an intimate and courageousself-examination, a revelation of a writer’s creative processes, a tender, watchful nature journal, and a meditation on life, love, marriage, friendship, solitude, society, time and mortality. It’s one of the greatest diaries ever written, and it’s excellent to see it back in print.</p><p>Woolf’s first surviving diary entry was made in 1897, when she was nearly 15; her last was on 24 March 1941, four days before her death. She kept these 42 years’ worth of writings in unlined notebooks with soft covers which she bound in coloured papers. She often referred back to them to remind herself of her past, and she drew on them when she started her memoir, Sketch of the Past, in 1939. When her London house was bombed in October 1940, she made sure to salvage them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/22/the-diary-of-virginia-woolf-review-a-book-for-the-ages">Continue reading...</a>

## The scientist who raised dangers of carbon dioxide in 1950s

<p>Physicist Gilbert Plass predicted climate change, blaming fossil fuels for rising temperatures</p><p>It’s often assumed that most people in the 1950s were blissfully unaware of climate change, but in fact there were already alarm bells ringing. In 1953, the Canadian physicist Gilbert Plass talked to a scientific meeting about the dangers of carbon dioxide pollution. “The large increase in industrial activity during the present century is discharging so much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere that the average temperature is rising at the rate of 1.5 degrees [fahrenheit] per century,” he announced in a sensational statement that became headline news around the world.</p><p>Although climate scientists had realised that world temperatures were rising, they put forward other explanations for the warming, such as sunspots or wobbles in the Earth’s orbit around the sun. Plass had researched the climate in his spare time while working at the Ford motor company, before publishing his research in two science journals, as well as writing a popular piece in a science magazine. In 1961, he went further and blamed fossil fuels for most of the global warming. His words were prophetic – CO<sub>2</sub> levels in the atmosphere were about 310 parts per million and now they are over 420ppm and rising each year, along with global temperatures.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/22/gilbert-plass-scientist-raised-dangers-carbon-dioxide-climate-change">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Borrowers with expiring fixed-rate or tracker mortgages face difficulties, with some saying they will be forced to sell their homes</p><p>For Steven, a media consultant from Guildford, and his wife, the remortgaging nightmare is only beginning. “People like me can’t sleep at night – it’s horrendous,” he says. “The mortgage for our three-bed cottage is up for renewal in December. We’ve geared our lives around the low interest rates of the past 13 years. I am the only earner in the family. If interest rates hit 6%, I’ll have to find an extra £1,480 per month – well over double what we pay now. That is totally catastrophic for our family, absolutely terrifying.”</p><p>The UK is experiencing the sharpest, fastest rise in interest rates since the 1980s, and markets and homeowners are braced for another increase from the Bank of England on Thursday, with an increase of at least 0.25 percentage points from 4.5% expected.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/22/this-is-ruining-peoples-lives-homeowners-hit-by-uk-mortgage-crisis-speak-out">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Docking 75 years ago, they had no idea of the difficulties ahead. This country made nothing easy. It should salute their achievement</p><p>Look again at that picture taken 75 years ago at Tilbury docks. Look at those people as they posed for the historic photographs. Look at their faces; wearied from a month of travel, etched with joy, hope, bewilderment and lurking stage left, just out of sight, foreboding.</p><p>As the descendants of that Windrush generation, we get to look at those faces every day in the pictures of our own families that we hang on the walls and in our front rooms. They have the same posed smiles, the demeanour of all adventurers who smile at the outset of an uncertain journey. There were 492 of them and they knew they had to impress and account for themselves. The attire was pin-sharp, whatever could be said of them on arrival, it was not to be that they were slovenly. They knew enough to show that they came in peace. Some sang and exuded bonhomie for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2__Canb80NM">Pathé News</a>, but others interviewed on the day sought to echo the self-effacement and deprecation they saw as essentially English.

They would have to learn much quickly in turbulent decades.</p><p>Hugh Muir is the Guardian’s executive editor, Opinion</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/22/britain-windrush-75-pioneers-country-achievement">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The soup of my childhood has become a symbol of Putin’s assault on Ukrainian land, culture and heritage, of his drive to plunder and obliterate Ukraine</p><p>On 25 February 2022, I woke up after a turbulent night checking news updates about Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Amid the shock and bouts of crying and doomscrolling, a seemingly trivial yet intimately unsettling thought entered my mind. I realised that after years of investigating national cuisines and identities for a book I was working on, I no longer knew how to think or talk about borsch, a beet soup that Ukraine and Russia claimed as their own.</p><p>I grew up in Soviet Moscow eating borsch – борщ in Cyrillic, no “t” at the end, that’s a Yiddish addition – at least twice a week; after we emigrated in 1974, it signified for me the complicated, difficult home we had left. Here in Queens, New York, where I live, a big pot made by my mother usually sat in my fridge. But who <em>did</em> have the right to claim it as heritage? That tangled question of cultural ownership I’d been reflecting on for so long had landed on my own table with an intensity that suddenly felt viscerally personal.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2023/jun/22/i-no-longer-know-how-to-think-about-borsch">Continue reading...</a>

Many took on large debts to buy homes during an era of record-low borrowing costs and are now facing monthly bills hundreds of pounds higher than they budgeted for.
