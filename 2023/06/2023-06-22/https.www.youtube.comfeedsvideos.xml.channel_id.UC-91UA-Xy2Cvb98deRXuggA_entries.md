I discuss two articles on Forbes written by CEO Stephen Miles, titled "Pull Up a Chair: The Office Slowly Returns" and "The End of an Era: Employers Take Back Control."

The CEO Belittles employees by saying "Most employees haven't experienced real hardship" pointing to how the workplace is going to get much more difficult and way less flexible. 

The CEO argues that employees have become entitled and that flexibility in the workplace will no longer be a perk.

He suggests that employees should be required to be in the office on designated days per week, referring to these days as "density days."

The CEO claims that virtual work leads to lower engagement and higher levels of grumpiness, although this argument is not supported by evidence.
