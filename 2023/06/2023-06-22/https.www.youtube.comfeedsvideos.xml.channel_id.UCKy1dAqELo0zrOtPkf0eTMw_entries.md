Watch the trailer for The Beanie Bubble, an upcoming movie starring Zach Galifianakis, Elizabeth Banks, Sarah Snook, and Geraldine Viswanathan.

Why did the world suddenly treat stuffed animals like gold? Ty Warner was a frustrated toy salesman until his collaboration with three women grew his masterstroke of an idea into the biggest toy craze in history. The Beanie Bubble is an inventive story about what and who we value, and the unsung heroes whose names didn't appear on the heart-shaped tag. 
 
From the married directing duo Kristin Gore (“Her,” “Foxcatcher”) and Damian Kulash, Jr. (lead singer of OK Go), and written by Gore, comes one of America’s most outlandish success stories. The Beanie Bubble is produced by Imagine Entertainment’s Brian Grazer, Ron Howard, and Karen Lunder and executive produced by Galifianakis and Douglas S. Jones.

The Beanie Bubble will be available in select theaters on July 21 and globally on Apple TV+ on July 28, 2023.

Of the many teasers, trailers, gameplay reveals and other ways video games fought for our attention these last few weeks, one stood out: Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth’s reveal, a two minute clip of the newest protagonist, Ichiban Kasuga, waking up fully nude on a presumably Hawaiian beach. Where are his clothes? We don’t know. Why is he on the beach? That’s anyone’s guess! What is the rest of this game actually about? It’s a mystery! But that’s exactly how a game trailer should be, something exciting enough to get your attention, but not revealing enough that it spoils the whole experience. And what’s more revealing than a muscular naked man recreating an iconic Austin Powers gag where his doodad is constantly obscured by objects carefully framed in the foreground? Really, one of the best naked-guy-on-beach video game trailers ever made, easily the best one since Death Stranding.

Dumb Money is the ultimate David vs. Goliath tale, based on the insane true story of everyday people who flipped the script on Wall Street and got rich by turning GameStop (yes, the mall videogame store) into the world’s hottest company. In the middle of everything is regular guy Keith Gill (Paul Dano), who starts it all by sinking his life savings into the stock and posting about it. When his social posts start blowing up, so does his life and the lives of everyone following him. As a stock tip becomes a movement, everyone gets rich – until the billionaires fight back, and both sides find their worlds turned upside down.

Dumb Money is directed by Craig Gillespie, written by Lauren Schuker Blum & Rebecca Angelo, based on the book “The Antisocial Network” by Ben Mezrich.

Dumb Money opens in theaters on September 22, 2023.
