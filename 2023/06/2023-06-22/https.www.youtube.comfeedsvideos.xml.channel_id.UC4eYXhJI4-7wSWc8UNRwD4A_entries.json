Together, these artists represent the past, present and future of Black music. This month of carefully curated shows is a celebration of Black artists expressing themselves in ways we've never seen before, and of the Tiny Desk's unique way of showcasing that talent.\n\nSidney Madden | June 22, 2023\n\u201cI think we\u2019re in the groove now,\u201d Amaarae laughs to her bandmates midway through her Tiny Desk concert. As one of the few breaks she takes in a 20-minute set, the singer-songwriter uses this pause to check the energy and drip of her musical consiglieres. While Amaarae and her soprano command attention in a distressed, rust-colored trench and corset top, the 11-piece band compliment their star by rocking t-shirts of the same color palette embroidered with standout lyrics from the songs she\u2019s performing; \u201cSee my essence, feel my blessings,\u201d \u201cWasted eyes on you\u201d, \u201cI like coffee with some head in the morning.\u201d \n\nIt's this level of intention, precision and playfulness that has gotten the Ghanaian-American artist to her Tiny Desk moment. As a writer, her searing wordplay beckons with confidence that\u2019s cooler than the other side of the pillow. As a producer, her ear for opposites-attract rhythms create singular moments on any chart they grace. As a Tiny Desk performer, the sunny, juicy jam of \u201cBig Steppa,\u201d acoustic imagining of \u201cDisguise\u201d and extended jubilance of \u201cSAD GIRLZ LUV MONEY\u201d are anchored by Amaarae\u2019s knowledge that she\u2019s serving up something so forward-facing, it\u2019s incomparable. \n\nBorn in the Bronx but hailing from Accra, Ghana, Amaarae\u2019s appearance on NPR Music\u2019s Black Music Month lineup proves how far the sounds of West Africa have stretched to influence the U.S. and, more implicitly, just how much the music defies catch-all labels like \u2018Afrobeats.\u2019 Fountain Baby, the album that\u2019s home to most of the songs Amaarae performs at the Desk, represents what she does best. While it may be categorized as \u201cpop\u201d by streaming services, as an experience, Fountain Baby is an overflowing stream of genre-swerving liquid dopamine, lulling and surprising its listener in waves. Pulling influence from a grab bag of global incantations, Amaarae makes African percussion flirt with baile funk and alt\u00e9, pop punk and garage, resulting in one of most triumphant albums and Tiny Desk Concerts of 2023 so far. \n\n\nSET LIST\n\u201cReckless & Sweet\u201d\n\u201cWasted Eyes\u201d\n\u201cDisguise\u201d\n\u201cBig Steppa\u201d\n\u201cCo-Star\u201d\n\u201cHELLZ ANGEL\u201d\n\u201cSAD GIRLZ LUV MONEY\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS\nAmaarae: vocals\nKZDidIt: arrangement, percussion \nKyu Steed: arrangement, vocals, shaker\nTom Levesque: trumpet \nAlex Goldblatt: guitar \nBraxton Cook: saxophone\nAmber Nicole: backing vocals\nDominique Abrams: backing vocals\n\nThe Compozers \nNana Pokes: bass\nCharlie Biggz: 1st keyboard\nDavid Melodee: 2nd keyboard \nStephen Asamoah-Duah: drums\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Sidney Madden\nDirector/Editor: Kara Frame\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nCreative Director: Bob Boilen \nSeries Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Sofia Seidel\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Michael Zamora\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Hazel Cills\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #blackmusicmonth #amaarae", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyP2VGUQMY", "date_published": "2023-06-22 09:00:30+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
