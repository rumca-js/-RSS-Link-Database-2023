<p><strong>Old Fire Station, Oxford</strong> <br />The Drag Race Down Under judge plays an amused, sometimes confused, observer of social foibles through an arch anthropological lens<br /></p><p>I’m all for standup that feels ahead of the curve. But what to make of Rhys Nicholson, who spends the first half of their Wednesday night show referring to us as a Thursday night audience? This is comedy that’s not so much in-the-moment as 24 hours ahead of it. But it’s easy to forgive the slip, because the comic (and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/apr/30/start-your-engines-for-drag-race-down-under-heres-everything-you-need-to-know">Drag Race Down Under</a> judge) delivers a fine standup set here, which won the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/melbourne-international-comedy-festival">Melbourne comedy festival</a>’s main award in 2022.</p><p>As the title Rhys! Rhys! Rhys! implies, the set makes no bones about its main subject: our host themself. Bow tied, hair dyed and sharp suited, the fastidious 33-year-old is here to talk about life as a queer person experiencing early-onset middle age. They’re contemplating marriage and parenthood while friends – to Nicholson’s wicked delight – are starting to divorce. The discomfort of the modern straight male offers another source of sharp satisfaction, even as Nicholson makes new discoveries about their own gender identity.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/22/rhys-nicholson-review-sharp-suits-sharp-wit-and-wickedly-caustic-camp">Continue reading...</a>

I’ve built my career appealing to a specific crowd of self-professed weirdos. They’ve flocked to see me take a tinned spaghetti bath while dressed as a giant cockroach.

I have to consume camp content to survive – irreverent, brash, and in-on-the-joke humour that pokes air holes in the box we’ve been vacuum-packed in by society. When my friends and I see something we can’t deal with in magnitude or subject matter, we label it “TOO camp” and move on.
