DuckDuckGo said that the browser (called simply \u201cDuckDuckGo for Windows\u201d) boasts \u201cbest-in-class\u201d privacy functionality, which is enabled by default. It blocks trackers before they load, which DuckDuckGo said lets it consume fully 60% less data than Google Chrome.</p><p>The browser doesn\u2019t yet support extensions, but the company said that the built-in functionality replicates some of the most common extension use cases, like ad blocking, privacy, password management, and a \u201cDuck Player\u201d mode for watching YouTube that stops the lion\u2019s share of tracking and advertising present on that platform.</p><p class=\"jumpTag\"><a href=\"https://www.computerworld.com/article/3700768/duckduckgo-launches-privacy-first-windows-browser-in-beta.html#jump\">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>", "link": "https://www.computerworld.com/article/3700768/duckduckgo-launches-privacy-first-windows-browser-in-beta.html#tk.rss_all", "date_published": "2023-06-22 19:23:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.computerworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Is your business missing out on a free Apple opportunity?", "description": "<article>\n\t<section class=\"page\">\n<p>Have you claimed the Apple Maps card for your business?
