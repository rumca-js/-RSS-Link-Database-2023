  <p id="cFTjQH">YouTube wants to make it easier to dub your videos in other languages by giving you some help with AI. The company announced Thursday at VidCon that it’s bringing over the team from <a href="https://aloud.area120.google.com/">Aloud</a>, an AI-powered dubbing service from Google’s Area 120 incubator. </p>
<p id="74FcwW">Here’s how it works, <a href="https://aloud.area120.google.com/">according to Aloud’s website</a>. The tool first transcribes your video, giving you a transcription that you can review and edit. Then, it translates and produces the dub. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQbKv2bhY_s">This video has the details</a>. </p>
<div id="kYZGsB"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div>
<p id="hyodrw">YouTube is already testing the tool with “hundreds” of creators, YouTube’s Amjad Hanif says in a statement to <em>The Verge.</em> And Hanif says that Aloud currently supports a “few” languages, with “more to come”; according to spokesperson Jessica Gibby, Aloud is currently...</p>

  <p id="FFeZxd">YouTube now requires users who run fan accounts to “make it obvious” in their channel name or handle that they don’t actually represent the company or artist that their account revolves around. That’s <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/222141263/updates-to-youtube-policies-for-fan-channels?hl=en">according to an update</a> spotted <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/06/22/youtube-cracking-down-fan-channels/">earlier by <em>9to5Google</em></a>, which says the <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801947">new impersonation policy</a> goes into effect on August 21st, 2023.</p>
<p id="frdpTC">Previously, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230315092248/https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801947">YouTube’s policies</a> never carved out rules for fan accounts. It simply stated that channels designed to impersonate other channels or specific people aren’t allowed on the platform. But now, fan accounts must be clear that they aren’t affiliated with whoever their accounts are dedicated to or else risk having their account or channel deleted.</p>

  <p id="9C4ktJ">Heatwaves are pushing power grids to their brink around the world — a risk that can make an already dangerous situation deadly. </p>
<p id="lkkLZM">When temperatures spike, people tend to need air conditioning the most.

  <p id="bDcka6">It’s no secret that <em>Game of Thrones</em> has been a major influence on <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em> — the developers have said as much. “When we first started creating the game, we had our core team of about 30 members very early on buy the Blu-ray boxset of <em>Game of Thrones</em> and required everyone to watch it, because we wanted this type of feel,” <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-has-me-questioning-the-essence-of-the-series">producer Naoki Yoshida told <em>Eurogamer</em></a> earlier this year.</p>

Streamers will be able to set how much Hype Chats cost (with a minimum of up to $100 and a maximum of up to $500), and based on how much you pay, you’ll have a better-looking chat. “Higher value Hype Chats will stay at the top of chat longer, have longer allowed character counts, and have more standout designs,” Twitch said in a blog post.

With a price tag of $399, this miniature Autobot can walk, squat, kick, lean, dance, and even pick itself up from the ground. But there is one thing it can’t do: transform.</p>
<p id="PXrSk6">That’s probably one of the reasons why this Bumblebee figure is several hundred dollars less than its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22376256/hasbro-700-optimus-prime-toy-transform-motor-automatic-voice-command">self-transforming Optimus Prime counterpart</a>, which costs a cool $700 plus <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23022777/hasbro-robosen-transforming-optimus-prime-robot-trailer">an extra $750 for the auto-converting trailer</a> if you really want to go all out.

  <p id="yP9Gg1">Currently, the most sought-after application of AI video technology is text-to-video AI. The idea is anyone will be able to type a prompt into a text field, and within seconds — or, more likely, minutes — a video will be created using an AI model. Some of the biggest companies in tech are researching this. Meta announced <a href="https://makeavideo.studio/">Make-A-Video</a>, Google has announced <a href="https://imagen.research.google/">Imagen Video</a> and <a href="https://sites.research.google/phenaki/">Phenaki</a>, and <a href="https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/VideoLDM/samples.html">Nvidia</a> says it’s getting involved, too. </p>
<p id="k9Va1b">All of those projects aren’t available for public use, and the output of these systems is far from photorealistic: figures warp and morph, and there are obvious changes between frames. But the demos are public statements of research and development in the text-to-video field from large — and powerful — companies.</p>

  <p id="pEJ3es">I am a person who often struggles with vast, world-spanning fantasy stories. I just can’t keep track of all of the people and places and other proper nouns that make up the world. The result is that I spend a lot of time reading wikis to help me get through things like <em>The</em> <em>Lord of the Rings</em> or <em>The Witcher</em> — but that’s not very helpful in the moment when I’m watching a pivotal scene unfold. But <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23767669/final-fantasy-xvi-review-ps5">which just launched on the PS5</a>, has a helpful tool to make it a whole lot easier to follow its complex tale.</p>
