From now until July 6, you can jump into the limited-time story mission and earn a pair of cosmetics while embarking on a new chapter in the game's lore. In A Dark Deception, players will be assisting The Pirate Lord in finding a stolen treasure of his, though some unfortunate twists are sure to happen on the way, as the name implies.</p><p>For this latest Adventure, you'll earn two new cosmetics: Pendragon's pocket watch and the \"Deceiver and Deceived\" player title--scroll to the end to get a peek at those. But as always, you'll need to complete every one of the event's Deeds, or challenges, in order to earn that second one. Simply finishing the questline will only earn you the fancy pocket watch. But don't worry, we've already completed the whole adventure, which will take you an hour or two--maybe less with our guide and depending on how distracted you get.</p><p>Mind you that the next Adventure for Sea of Thieves is likely to be the first of three announced for the game's exciting Monkey Island crossover. Unlike The Pirate's Life crossover with Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean, The Legend of Monkey Island crossover will debut as limited-time Adventure-style missions. But in those cases, fear not, as the missions will eventually persist in the game permanently, which is a welcome but unique change to the usual Adventure structure.</p><p>Therefore, if you're first seeking to finish off A Dark Deception, you'll need to do it in the traditional sense: before the event disappears forever, taking the limited-time cosmetics with it. Here's how to complete the full story, including completing all Deeds and earning both Mementos.</p><p>Note that this story event guide will necessarily contain spoilers, but we've written it in such a way that the reveals in our text should only arrive as you're experiencing them for yourself in the game. Raise anchor and follow our trusty guide for A Dark Deception below.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Sail to N13 and speak to The Pirate Lord</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4156635-seaofthieves6_22_20239_41_35am.png\" /><br /><h3><p>The uncharted island located at N13 on your ship map has been home to many a story beats, and it's where you'll start this latest chapter, too. When you arrive, speak to The Pirate Lord, who will tell you his treasure has been stolen. He'll give you a signed note to take to Plunder Outpost, essentially vouching for you to be allowed to take the pocket watch from Madame Olivia in the Order of Souls tent.</p><p> </p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Sail to Plunder Outpost and speak to Madame Olivia</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4156633-seaofthieves6_22_20239_51_40am.png\" /><br /><h3><p>When you arrive at Plunder Outpost, the watch you need will be on the table in front of Madame Olivia in the Order of Souls tent, but no matter which dialogue option you choose, she's not willing to part with it. It has sentimental value to her, so you'll need to swipe it--a simple feat for a pirate, yes?</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Knock on the door behind the tavern</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4156632-seaofthieves6_22_20239_56_32am.png\" /><br /><h3><p>With Madame Olivia not budging, head around to the back of the tavern and knock \"quietly\" on the door on the left. Then knock again, and finally one more time with increasing vigor each time. On the third knock, a rat with curiously glowing green eyes will emerge from beneath the door and scurry into the Order of Souls tent, distracting Madame Olivia. </p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Follow the rat into the Order of Souls tent</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4156631-seaofthieves6_22_20239_57_21am.png\" /><br /><h3><p>While Madame Olivia is distracted by the rat, snatch the pocket watch from the table and be on your way. It doesn't seem as though you can fail this section, but just in case, be quick about it.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Sail to Shipwreck Bay and dock near the wreck of the Burning Blade</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4156630-seaofthieves6_22_202310_07_37am.png\" /><br /><h3><p>On the western side of the aptly named island, a shipwreck adorned with red banners is resting. This is The Burning Blade, Captain Flameheart's ship of yore. You'll want to angle your ship so that you can cannon-blast yourself onto the top deck. If you aim for the big red banner at the top, you should safely land where you need to.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Take the gem fragment from the ship's figurehead</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4156629-seaofthieves6_22_202310_09_32am.png\" /><br /><h3><p>Head down one of the ladders on either side of the banner you aimed for, and try to snatch the gem from the ship's figurehead. In our experience, our first attempt (on the left side of the figurehead) failed, requiring us to grab it on the right side. It's unclear if the right side is the only side that will give you the gem or if you're always meant to claim it on the second attempt. Therefore, you may save a measly 15 seconds if you try the right side first, if that's important to you.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Optional Deed: Search near the Blackwytche</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4156628-seaofthieves6_22_202310_12_29am.png\" /><br /><h3><p>The Blackwytche is the more famous shipwreck found inland on Shipwreck Bay. Head there and into the captain's quarters where you'll spot the same odd rat with glowing green eyes in the back-left corner of the room. Interact with the rat to complete this optional Deed.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Bring the gem to Madame Olive at Sanctuary Outpost</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4156627-seaofthieves6_22_202310_26_18am.png\" /><br /><h3><p>Now that you've claimed the gem, bring it to Madame Olive (not Olivia, mind you) at Sanctuary Outpost. Ask her to make you an enchanted compass using her, uh, witchy powers.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Optional Deed: Search near Madame Olive</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4156626-seaofthieves6_22_202310_28_08am.png\" /><br /><h3><p>A second missable moment with the strange rat can be completed on Sanctuary Outpost. Just outside the Order of Souls tent and beneath the stairs leading to the Pirate Emporium, you'll find the critter once more. Interact with them again to complete this Deed, leaving just one more such moment you'll want to complete soon.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>With the enchanted compass, sail to Port Merrick</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4156644-seaofthieves6_22_202310_25_37am.png\" /><br /><h3><p>Port Merrick, formerly Golden Sands Outpost, is the destination your compass will tell you to head toward, so sail there next.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Optional Deed: Search Port Merrick</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4156643-seaofthieves6_22_202310_41_26am.png\" /><br /><h3><p>When you arrive, your compass will point you toward a particular area of the tavern, but before you head there, enter through the front door next to where Larinna hangs out. Just inside the door will be your last missable moment in the form of a third encounter with the glowing rodent. Interact with them to polish off the optional portions of the Adventure.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Head under the tavern and through the tunnel</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4156624-seaofthieves6_22_202310_42_20am.png\" /><br /><h3><p>After you interact with the rat, jump into the water behind Larinna, then swim around the corner into the large tunnel suitable for rowboats. Look for an interact point in the corner we've included an image of in the picture above. <br /><br />Note: In order to \"Locate the stolen treasure,\" ensure that you or someone in your crew is the person to interact with this point. We completed the Adventure alongside an allied crew and they were first to use the interact point, which caused us to miss this Deed initially. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Speak to The Pirate Lord</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4156623-seaofthieves6_22_202310_42_37am.png\" /><br /><h3><p>Inside the hideout, you'll find a number of treasures, as well as The Pirate Lord. Speak to him to unveil the story's big twist, which we won't explicitly write here. This is also the last step for this Adventure and will thus complete the event.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>A Dark Deception cosmetic rewards</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4156634-seaofthieves6_22_20239_43_19am.png\" /><br /><h3><p>For completing the Adventure, you'll earn Pendragon's Pocket Watch. For completing all Deeds, including missable Deeds we've detailed here, you'll earn \"The Deceiver and the Deceived\" player title, too. </p><p>And that completes A Dark Deception, Sea of Thieves' 12th limited-time Adventure. Stay tuned for the next one, which we'll guide you through here as soon as it releases sometime in the weeks ahead.</p></h3></p><br />", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/sea-of-thieves-a-dark-deception-adventure-guide/2900-4785/", "date_published": "2023-06-22 20:04:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "How Overwatch 2's New Story Missions And Progression System Work", "description": "<p>Following the announcement that <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2s-pve-mode-is-being-scrapped-blizzard-explains-what-happened-and-why/1100-6514242/\">Blizzard would no longer be adding Hero Missions to Overwatch 2</a>, the team behind the hit first-person shooter has made a concentrated effort to explain what features are still on the way. In a <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/videos/overwatch-2-invasion-reveal-full-presentation/2300-6461728/\">recent livestream</a> dedicated to discussing the game's future and upcoming season, Invasion, the team elaborated on a number of upcoming features including Story missions and a never-before-seen hero progression system.</p><p>The team opened the presentation by <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-adding-story-missions-in-august-for-15/1100-6515170/\">explaining more about the game's upcoming Story missions</a>. While these might not be taking the same shape fans expected when the sequel was first announced, they will effectively move Overwatch's canonical story forward, something fans of the series have been waiting for for quite some time. According the studio, these missions will take place after Winston gathers all the former agents of Overwatch together, and prior to some operators meeting, such as Lucio and Reinhardt. These Story missions will give players a chance to see how certain characters first met each other, as well as what they were doing during Overwatch's downtime.</p><p>Blizzard then explained that the maps these Story missions will take place on will be \"four or five times larger\" than PvP maps, contain new enemies, and will use environmental features the team avoids using on PvP maps, such as tight tunnels. However, this isn't to say these maps will be entirely unfamiliar. The team confirmed that many of the maps created for these PvE experiences are largely new areas of maps already included in the game, such as King's Row and Junkertown.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-overwatch-2-new-story-missions-and-progression-system-work/1100-6515392/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-overwatch-2-new-story-missions-and-progression-system-work/1100-6515392/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-06-22 19:47:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "You Can Now Officially Use Excel In Eve Online", "description": "<p>You can now integrate your Excel spreadsheets with sci-fi MMO Eve Online via an official add-on.

Nintendo set a new standard for technical prowess when it pushed polygons on the Super NES, a feat that was incredibly impressive despite its rudimentary nature. Since then, Fox McCloud has become one of the company's most recognizable stars, featuring in every Super Smash Bros. game with wingman Falco also joining for most of them. But the core of the Star Fox brand is the on-rail shooter, which balanced white-knuckled fighter pilot action with acrobatic stunts and hidden secrets.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Fox and his friends have been through a lot together--eight games when including spin-offs. And while Nintendo has mostly hewed closely to its shooter roots, it has also found ways to expand on the Star Fox concept with new ideas and gameplay styles. These experiments have sometimes worked better than others, but they're consistently interesting and unique. Here are our favorite Star Fox games.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>More Nintendo Franchise Rankings</strong></p><ul><li dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-mario-games/2900-3811/\">Best Mario Games Of All Time</a></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-metroid-games-of-all-time-ranked/2900-3789/\">Best Metroid Games Of All Time, Ranked</a></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-pokemon-games-ranked/2900-3915/\">Best Pokemon Games, Ranked</a></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-zelda-games/2900-3788/\">Best Zelda Games, Ranked - Where Does Tears Of The Kingdom Fall?</a></li></ul></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>8. Star Fox 2</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4156038-3295948-zzz.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Star Fox 2, the direct sequel to the original groundbreaking SNES game, was canceled in 1995 as Nintendo prepared for the advent of higher-fidelity 3D games on the N64. Over the next two decades, it lived only as a rumor and prototype ROMs that made their way out among fans and gaming history buffs. That changed in 2017 when Nintendo restored the game and released it officially for the first time as part of its Super NES Classic Edition, one of several mini-consoles released around the time that house a library of classic games. A few years later, it also came to the Nintendo Switch Online service.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">While the official release satisfied the curiosity of longtime Nintendo fans, the actual game just isn't all that great. The rudimentary graphics and simple controls just aren't able to keep up with its ambitious ideas, and it's over almost as soon as it begins. This one is more of a curiosity than a game that ever did, or could, stand on its own.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7. Star Fox Zero</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4156017-zero.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The most-recent Star Fox game is also one of the worst, perhaps shaking expectations that Nintendo still has a steady hand on the yoke of the beloved rail-shooter series. Star Fox Zero had all the pieces in place, like the increased graphical fidelity of the Wii U and decent enough flying mechanics. But it invited unfavorable comparisons by modeling itself after the fan-favorite Star Fox 64. Parts of it seemed to be a total reimagining of SF64, in fact. And if you're going to come at what many regard to be the pinnacle of the series, you need to nail it. Instead, Star Fox Zero was a pale imitator, recalling some great moments but stymied by awkward controls and an overreliance on the Wii U gamepad that often saw you looking down at your controller rather than the TV screen.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6. Star Fox Guard</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4156019-guard.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Star Fox Guard is a radical departure from the standard Star Fox game, and not at all what Star Fox fans would have hoped to see out of a new game when it launched on the Wii U in 2016. But it's decent enough for what it is--a bonus pack-in game that came with Star Fox Zero. Instead of the dogfighting action that has defined the series since its inception, or even the tanks, subs, and on-foot segments that came to be a regular part of later entries, Star Fox Guard is a tower defense game. It made use of the Wii U gamepad for a two-screen experience, having you swap between an array of cameras to fire at approaching enemies. It got praise for its clever enemies like the chaos robots, which would interfere with cameras or even show you fake footage to throw you off. But it was also criticized for being a bit bland and short, and for the lack of online sharing for the level editor.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. Star Fox Assault</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4156014-assault.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">This traditional, if middling, entry in the Star Fox franchise released for the GameCube, and serves as a direct story sequel to Star Fox Adventures. Andross' nephew Andrew takes center stage as the new villain, and Fox and his crew of mercenaries have to battle against an invasion of Aparoid creatures. The major new elements were the on-ground blaster combat and the ability to swap between your Arwing and Landmaster at will, so stages were built to support both vehicles. It was a perfectly serviceable sequel but critics by and large felt it was a little too similar to prior entries and the design was simplistic.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. Star Fox Command</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4156015-command.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Star Fox Command is another game that broke heavily from its traditional rail-shooter roots, but this time the experiment largely worked. Instead of the usual Star Fox stage design, you were in command of the team's aircraft carrier, the Great Fox, along with all of the team's Arwings. Using a tactical command map, you had to plan routes to keep the Great Fox safe as it journeyed through stages, and then hop into all-range battle mode to shoot down enemies yourself. This lost some charm of its bespoke level designs that were designed like stunt courses, but it was a good fit for the Nintendo DS. The bite-sized levels were an easy way to hop in quickly for short bursts, and the stylus controls worked surprisingly well. It also expanded the world of Star Fox immensely, introducing tons of new characters and relationships. Director Dylan Cuthbert later stated that he saw this game as a sort of \"alternate timeline\" to have more flexibility with the characters.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. Star Fox</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4156016-starfox.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The original Star Fox hasn't aged as gracefully as some of the others. Even at the time, it was clear the Super NES was struggling to handle the load. But for many gamers of the era, it was the first mainstream game to center around polygons and a truly 3D space. It had difficulty spikes as sharp as its razor-like Arwing pieces, but it was an incredible technical achievement and a vision of the future. For setting the template of Star Fox and giving us a vision of the future, it deserves a place of honor.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. Star Fox Adventures</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4156013-adventures.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Star Fox Adventures is as divisive as it gets in the series. In the days of the 3D action-platformer, Nintendo and Rare went in a totally different direction. Inspired by the success of the Legend of Zelda series, Fox and his crew abandoned their Arwings for an Adventure mode presented as a third-person action-adventure game. Fox had a staff that he could use to dispatch enemies and solve puzzles, as well as build up a full skill suite. Arwings were present but extremely deemphasized, consisting of a handful of on-rail shooter segments as you travel from place to place. One reason? It didn't begin its life as a Star Fox game, and was initially planned as a new IP called Dinosaur Planet.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Not only was gameplay a huge departure from the norm, but the story was as well. Rather than a planet-hopping excursion across several biomes to battle an evil space-overlord, this one placed Fox and his band of mercenaries on a single planet--the aptly named Dinosaur Planet--with a narrower focus on Fox himself and a new ally named Krystal. All these changes were a lot for longtime Star Fox fans, leading to its divided reception. But among critics, it's one of the most highly rated in the series. As long as you take it on its own terms, it's a great game and an example of how Star Fox could stand to break from tradition more often.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. Star Fox 64</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4156012-64.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Nintendo set the standard for Star Fox in its very second released video game, and it's been chasing it in almost every release since. Star Fox 64 was everything the series aimed to be. The rail shooter segments consisted of branching paths that imbued the game with multiple ways of approaching its difficulty, as well as tons of secrets and hidden paths to unlock. The gibberish-speak of the first game was replaced with voice acting that would be at home on any Saturday morning cartoon. It expanded the roster of characters beyond the core four pilots to include several allies in the fight against Andross, along with ROB and your carrier ship, the Great Fox. And since Star Fox 2 had been scrapped, SF64 was our first introduction to all-range mode, a full 3D mode that let you get into intense dogfights with other ships.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The graphics were a visual feast on the N64, and they were given a bit of polish for its 3DS re-release years later. In fact, the 3DS port showcased how well the game had aged. Whereas the first Star Fox is an interesting artifact, Star Fox 64 is still just uproariously fun to play. This is also the best example to date of Star Fox venturing outside of its usual comfort zone of airborne dogfights, as it introduced both the Landmaster tank and Blue-Marine levels that had clear similarities to the Arwing but felt special as a nice change of pace.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Star Fox 64 is skill-testing, rewarding, and still a fantastic game all these years later. Nintendo has never quite matched this level since the release of Star Fox 64. This is the ultimate Star Fox</p></h3></p><br />", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-star-fox-games-ranked/2900-4784/", "date_published": "2023-06-22 18:13:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Forever Skies Is 20% Off During Its Launch Week", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">The apocalyptic survival game Forever Games just launched in Early Access for PC, and you can grab it at a nice 20% discount during its launch week.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The launch week discount brings the game down to just $24 (normally $30) on both <span class=\"norewrite\">           <a href=\"https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-100770772-13797872?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/forever-skies\">Fanatical</a> </span> and <span class=\"norewrite\">           <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1641960/Forever_Skies/\">Steam.</a> </span> While Fanatical keys unlock on Steam, buying from Fanatical gets you a bonus 5%-off coupon you can use on future Fanatical purchases.

After its world premiere at Summer Game Fest, I got the chance to go hands-on with Bandai Namco's adaptation of Toriyama's take on a Mad Max-like world--albeit, a world that centers around a demon boy with a heart of gold (because of course).</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Years after a natural disaster and war, the world is left a desert wasteland where water is scarce and a tyrannical king now dangles his private supply of it as a precious and expensive resource. Like any post-apocalyptic story, gangs and factions now ravage the land, scavenging and raiding its resources, fighting over what's barely left of it. That includes Sheriff Rao, a hoarse-voiced old man tired of the king's greed, who sets out on his own pilgrimage to find water for his people. He eventually crosses paths with an unexpecting partner, the son of Lucifer himself, Beelzebub, the quirky demon prince who joins Rao on his journey out of, as it was described to me, boredom.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Springing off the heels of Rao and Beelzebub's unsanctioned allyship, the demo began with an action-packed set piece that saw our unlikely duo slamming the pedal to the metal in Rao's jeep while trying to outrun a geji dragon--an enormous, dinosaur-sized lizard squirming and swimming beneath the sand, hot on the tail of our heroes. In what felt like a scene out of Uncharted, I steered Rao's jeep, weaving and dodging down a narrow canyon as the Geji Dragon burst from the ground trying to catch me in its grasps, before diving back into the sand all sandworm-like as if it was from Dune. It felt big, and not just because the dragon took up most of the screen, but as a tone piece for the world Sand Land is set in. There's far more to fear in Sand Land than just bandits and scarce resources, there's also giant, terrifying, menacing dinosaurs, too. Thankfully, as the son of Lucifer, Beelzebub has a few moves up his sleeves to stand his ground.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sand-land-is-an-action-packed-take-on-a-long-dormant-manga/1100-6515393/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sand-land-is-an-action-packed-take-on-a-long-dormant-manga/1100-6515393/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-06-22 14:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Spielberg And Scorsese Having \"Emergency Call\" With WB Discovery CEO After Latest Move", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">According to a report from <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/features/commentary/tcm-layoffs-warner-bros-spielberg-scorsese-paul-thomas-anderson-protest-1234877220/\">IndieWire</a>, Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, and Paul Thomas Anderson have come together for an \"emergency call\" to address the recent layoffs at Turner Classic Movies in an emergency call with Warner Bros.

Historically, Final Fantasy games are quite long in runtime as they're narratively driven and typically feature tons of optional content. FFXVI follows suit, but with this one leaning heavily towards action gameplay and a somewhat linear structure, so it can be a shorter endeavor depending on your approach. Whether you mainline the story quests, dabble in sidequests, or take part in the various forms of optional content, here's how long FFXVI will take to finish.</p><h2>How long is Final Fantasy 16?</h2><p>If you <strong>strictly follow the main quests</strong> of FFXVI, the ones marked with a red quest icon, you can get through the game in <strong>roughly 30 hours</strong>. It's a cinematic experience with low-key quest objectives interspersed with action-heavy dungeons, boss fights, and Eikon battles, so the game takes time to deliver those elements.</p><p>However, sidequests are relatively important to the Final Fantasy experience and FFXVI has plenty of these between the major story beats. Within your homebase called The Hideaway and in the various open regions throughout the game, green quest markers will pop up signifying a sidequest. Those with plus signs in the marker indicate sidequests that unlock new gameplay features, such as <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-a-chocobo-mount-in-final-fantasy-16/1100-6515406/\">unlocking the Chocobo mount</a>. If you do <strong>all the sidequests and the main story</strong>, finishing FFXVI would take <strong>somewhere between 45 to 50 hours</strong>.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-long-to-beat-final-fantasy-16-main-quests-and-completionist-estimates/1100-6515407/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-long-to-beat-final-fantasy-16-main-quests-and-completionist-estimates/1100-6515407/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-06-22 01:23:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
