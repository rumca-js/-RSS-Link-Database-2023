<p>From tackling the harm caused by the musician’s rhetoric to addressing the stigma around discussions of West’s mental health, this is seriously important TV</p><p>How does it happen, that one day you are a revered musical artist, innovator and fashion empire-builder capable of turning everything you touch to gold, and the next you are a Trump-hugging, Holocaust-denying darling of the US far right, telling people that you hope Jewish children “look at their daddies and say ‘Why is Ye mad at us?’”? The Trouble With KanYe, the latest documentary by award-winning journalist Mobeen Azhar, sets out to answer not just this question – compelling though the evolution of musician Kanye-now-Ye West is – but the even more important one of where it might lead and what it might mean for us all.</p><p>Azhar takes us quickly but precisely through the milestones in West’s career. In 2003, he released his debut single and began his meteoric rise to fame, fortune and critical acclaim, selling millions of records, marrying Kim Kardashian and beginning a partnership with Adidas that would come to be worth billions. There were accusations of misogyny and the odd troubling remark – anti-Black, antisemitic – along the way, but nothing to scare the horses (or the sponsors).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/28/the-trouble-with-kanye-review-this-hugely-impressive-documentary-holds-the-far-right-figurehead-to-account">Continue reading...</a>

<p>On his last Ashes tour the opener, more watchful than in the past, again gave Australia a good start at Lord’s in second Test</p><p>You get the sense that David Warner has spent his lifetime looking for a fight. Speak to players who came up against the young version in suburban Sydney cricket, remembering Warner prowling the boundary getting stuck into fielders when he had finished batting. Trace a line all the way to the current era, the old stager version running out on to the field with skipping feet, ready to sway and duck and jab.</p><p>All the way through, there has always been a flashpoint, a point to prove. An Indian opener, a Zimbabwe A wicketkeeper, a Cricket Australia head of high performance. Warner has held on to resentments, from peers or opponents or media, and relished the feeling of vindication from some starring subsequent performance. In the end it hasn’t really mattered who, or what, or why. The conflict has been the thing, pushed down inside until it is powerful, some compressed puck of solid-propellant fuel to fire his next launch.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jun/28/david-warner-great-survivor-up-for-ashes-fight-australia-england">Continue reading...</a>

Inside the main banqueting suite of the national stadium, generations of black footballers, their friends and family, and others from the English game, gathered to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the arrival of the Windrush. There was jerk chicken, potent rum punch and much laughter, but the challenges that faced those first Caribbean immigrants and their descendants were not far from mind either.</p><p>Luther Blissett reflected on being reunited with his parents as a five-year-old after they, like many who left the West Indies for England, had had to travel without children to take up a new life. He recalled the first time he was called the N word as he grew up in Willesden, north-west London. Finally, he spoke too about becoming the first black player to score for England, on his debut, with a hat-trick.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/28/wembleys-windrush-75-event-offers-reminder-of-barriers-for-black-players">Continue reading...</a>

<p>History will judge the prime minister harshly for abandoning urgency over the climate emergency  </p><p>The climate emergency is not a priority for Rishi Sunak. Britain is committed to reaching net zero by 2050, but the prime minister is focused on a closer horizon. The environment does not feature among the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/04/sunak-vows-to-be-steady-hand-on-tiller-but-are-his-pledges-all-sleight-of-hand" title="">five pledges</a> on which he asks to be judged at the next election. Ministers take their lead from Downing Street, rationing their urgency for things that are likely to be noticed by the boss. And so, with grim inevitability, environmental policy has slid down the agenda. Britain, having been a leader in the field, is becoming a slacker. That is the conclusion of the Climate Change Committee (CCC), the panel of experts that advises government and monitors progress towards lower carbon emissions.</p><p>The CCC’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/28/uk-has-made-no-progress-on-climate-plan-say-governments-own-advisers" title="">latest report</a>, published on Wednesday, describes a pattern of failure across a range of fields, from home insulation and electric vehicle charging to renewable power generation and decarbonising heavy industry. The UK has forfeited the leadership role afforded by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/23/uk-governments-climate-pledges-cop26-president-alok-sharma" title="">Cop26 presidency</a> and missed the potentially galvanising moment presented by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/21/energy-crisis-ukraine-war-uk-cost-gas" title="">energy crisis</a> that followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In the committee’s judgment, Britain “did not embrace the rapid steps that could have been taken to reduce energy demand and grow renewable generation”, but has instead “backtracked on fossil fuel commitments”, with consent given for a new coal mine and new licences for North Sea oil and gas production.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/28/the-guardian-view-on-rishi-sunak-and-net-zero-a-cowardly-retreat">Continue reading...</a>

Five young lives are destroyed in an instant, which the author describes in a few short pages: we have seen only the briefest glimpse of spindly-kneed Alec and twins Jo and Val before their deaths.</p><p>“What has gone is not just the children’s present existence,” he observes. “It’s all the futures they won’t get, too. All the would-be’s, might-be’s, could-be’s of the decades to come. How can that loss be measured … ?” Spufford attempts that greater reckoning by writing the lives they might have lived: in many regards inconsequential, full of hopes and disappointments and failures, petty school cruelties, love, dodgy dealings, violence and mental illness – yet inherently valuable. What might have seemed a literary conceit reminds us, devastatingly, what is lost when a life is cut short.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/28/the-guardian-view-on-ukraines-suffering-mourning-the-lives-unlived">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sunak appears to have accepted defeat but Rebecca Pow appears incapable of recognising reality</p><p>So much for holding your nerve. Rishi Sunak appears to have lost his. He looks beaten. The man who has lived his entire life in a gilded protective cage – Winchester head boy, Oxford, Goldman Sachs, the Tory party – is now powerless to stave off defeat. The real world has finally caught up with him. Or he with it. There are no easy fixes. Only barely managed decline. It’s no longer a question of if he fails. The only game in town is when.</p><p>You can sense the despair in Sunak’s body language. His shoulders are hunched. A small man making himself even smaller. His eyes look sunken, half dead. His speech reduced to a tired monotone. His repartee shot to pieces: neither funny nor clever. Deep down, somewhere in the hell that is his subconscious, he knows the game is up.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/28/rish-drowns-in-despair-as-water-minister-finds-herself-way-out-her-depth">Continue reading...</a>

## Wage rises are driving inflation? Don’t swallow this dangerous rightwing myth  | Owen Jones

<p>All the evidence is there: corporate greed is the culprit, but policymakers daren’t take on big business</p><p>To cure an illness, the right diagnosis is needed. Without it, the risk is that the wrong medicine will be prescribed, failing to address the underlying malady and even inflicting needless pain on the patient. So it goes for the devastating wave of inflation that has swept much of the world. The roles of the pandemic, disrupted supply chains, Brexit and Russia’s egregious invasion of Ukraine have all been much discussed. But a dangerous myth has been deliberately manufactured into an apparent piece of common sense: that wages must be suppressed if surging prices are to be contained.</p><p>Before we go into the details of how this myth has been propagated, it’s important to establish the facts: inflation has been caused by corporate profiteering, not wage increases. Don’t take my word for it. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development looked this month at whether workers, business or governments had contributed most to inflation, and the data revealed that in the UK <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/ce188438-en/1/3/1/index.html?itemId=/content/publication/ce188438-en&amp;_csp_=f8e326092da6dbbbef8fbfa1b8ad3d52&amp;itemIGO=oecd&amp;itemContentType=book#figure-d1e804-6539cc9538">business</a> was most to blame.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/28/wage-rises-inflation-rightwing-myth-greed-business">Continue reading...</a>

Things are bad, this causes worker attitudes or finances to deteriorate, and the result is that things get worse still – and down we go. Until we hit rock bottom and are forced to face our reality. Perhaps countries do the same too. At that point we have to confront what is wrong in society, but never had the courage or opportunity to embrace.

And partly optimistic, in that it also reminds us that the ideology was succeeded by a more rational approach towards the arts and our culture more generally.</p><p>In testifying to “the rich and complex relationship” between France and England that Marie Lavandier of France’s National Monuments Centre refers to, could the exhibition reflect a desire on both sides of the Channel to end the systematic spoiling that continues to be inflicted by the Brexit ideology?<br /><strong>Andrew Hillier</strong> <br /><em>London</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/28/paris-va-show-gets-to-the-art-of-anglo-french-ties">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Water privatisation in England and Wales has achieved just one thing: the enrichment of executives and overseas shareholders</p><p>Thames Water is on the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/28/contingency-plans-reportedly-being-drawn-up-for-thames-water-collapse">brink of collapse</a>, with emergency plans being drawn up to take the company into temporary public ownership. It’s an extraordinary state of affairs: how could a business with a regional monopoly over an essential service not manage to maintain a financially sustainable footing? The answer: an extractive ownership model has seen the company loaded with debt, and returns for its investors prioritised over the needs of both people and the environment. As interest rates have risen sharply over recent months, this inherently precarious business model has come under acute and seemingly fatal pressure.</p><p>The story of Thames Water is emblematic of wider failures of privatisation. Since the late 1980s, water companies in England and Wales have paid out <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b2314ae0-9e17-425d-8e3f-066270388331">£72bn</a> to shareholders. To help pay for this generosity, the water companies – which were sold off without debts – have borrowed on an exceptional scale, accumulating a debt pile of £53bn.</p><p>Mathew Lawrence is director of Common Wealth and co-author of Owning the Future with Adrienne Buller</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/28/thames-water-public-ownership-water-privatisation-england-and-wales-executives-shareholders">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Grey has nothing to do with joy, optimism, passion or life. Why has the world been drained of colour?</p><p>My friend once came to see me in a flat I’d just moved into. This was Lee Dixon, the former footballer and a television colleague at the time. He looked around approvingly but said: “You’ve got to be a bit careful here. Your carpets, your sofa and your walls are all grey. You’ve got these big windows and outside the clouds are grey. Your hair is grey and so are your clothes. Your disposition’s a bit grey sometimes, too. You’re blending in. I can barely see you. You might have to put on some hi-vis.”</p><p>Footballers can be terribly savage like this. But I saw Lee had a point, and I’ve been trying to de-grey myself ever since. This is hard in the world we live in. Having chosen a new lease car, I had to select a colour. I was spoilt for choice: there were only shades of grey available, so I plumped for grey. Looking around, it then struck me that most cars are now grey. Apart from the sheer dreariness, this is surely suboptimal in terms of safety; like me in my front room that day, they’re all camouflaged against the roads and, often, the sky.</p><p>Adrian Chiles is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/28/everything-in-our-world-is-grey-how-did-we-come-to-this">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Have you become more stressed about big gatherings since the pandemic? You’re certainly not alone. Here is how to leave fear behind and have a great time</p><p>As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGoqfIajW7I">the great Oliver Cheatham once sang</a>, “I like to party … Everybody does.” Except, it’s not true, is it? Not everyone does like to party. In fact, it never ceases to amaze me how many people will admit, in private, to hating parties. It’s actually quite hard to find anyone who is a self-confessed party animal, especially since the pandemic.</p><p>And yet the party spirit lives on. People continue to have birthday gatherings, host soirees (even though they can’t pronounce “soiree”) and insist on having work leaving dos no one wants to go to except the people nobody wants there. Sometimes I’m not sure why we do this to ourselves. But we do. And it’s got to be a good thing – otherwise, our lives would just be work, home and the screens. When you put it that way, maybe parties are the only vestige of humanity we have left. We’ve gotta fight for our right to party – with confidence. Here’s how.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/28/flex-your-social-muscles-and-stick-to-one-drink-10-ways-to-be-much-more-confident-at-parties">Continue reading...</a>

<p>France’s decision to pull out as hosts in 2025 has created problems – and opportunities – for countries around the world</p><p>By <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/gavin-willacy">Gavin Willacy</a> for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nohelmetsrequiredbook">No Helmets Required</a></p><p>In the next couple of weeks, the International Rugby League (IRL) will decide where and when the next Rugby League World Cup will be held. Five potential bids have emerged since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/15/2025-rugby-league-world-cup-in-doubt-after-france-pull-out-of-staging-event">France pulled out as hosts last month</a>. Word from the antipodes is the NRL is willing to put enough of their copious money on the table for Australia to host a pared back, men’s only tournament for eight teams to plug the gap. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/16/new-zealand-makes-bid-to-co-host-2025-rugby-league-world-cup-with-australia-after-france-pulls-out">New Zealand are also keen to host in 2025</a>. Their bid includes the Pacific islands and Papua New Guinea, and would ideally match the three-event, 32-team model used in England last year. And then there was the unlikely interest from Fiji, Qatar and South Africa.</p><p>Each bid has major drawbacks. Going back to Australia just eight years after their last World Cup would be awkward but not as problematic as telling most of the men’s teams they can’t be there and all of the women’s and wheelchair players that they won’t be. Going back to an eight-team tournament for the first time since 1995 would probably mean only inviting last year’s quarter-finalists, who were told they had qualified automatically for 2025. All of the sport’s most popular nations would be present other than France, and there would be no place for Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Jamaica, or anyone else. That would not go down well.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/no-helmets-required/2023/jun/28/international-rugby-league-world-cup-france-hosts-2025">Continue reading...</a>

The move was applauded by campaigners and<a href="https://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/news/release/whitehouse-applauds-un-effort-to-root-out-fossil-fuel-lobbying-from-global-climate-summits"> politicians alike</a>, but it’s a shockingly small first step towards matching the boldness demanded by UN secretary general, António Guterres, when it comes to rooting out fossil fuel influence. In a <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/climate-change-uns-guterres-lambasts-fossil-fuel-firms/a-65932823">speech earlier this month</a>, Guterres called for the phase out of fossil fuels themselves, and said oil majors must “cease and desist influence peddling and legal threats designed to knee-cap progress.”</p><p>The UN’s move to transparently label lobbyists at Cop28 looks a lot like damage control after recent embarrassing revelations, such as there having been <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/cop26-glasgow-oil-gas-lobbyists-b1953513.html">more oil lobbyists</a> than any one nation’s delegation at Cop26 in Glasgow. But to actually rid Cop of fossil fuel influence, the UN has to go far beyond finally unmasking industry lobbyists; it needs to hold up a mirror to its own enabling behaviour over the years, then reverse all of it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/28/cop-28-fossil-fuel-lobbyists-oil-gas-companies">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Grand Départ will be in the Basque Country this year before crossing the Pyrenees and then heading across the Massif Central</p><p>The Tour starts in Spain’s foremost cycling heartland, with a stage through the Basque Country hills which will give many the jitters. Four stiff ascents in the final 80km with the Côte de Pike less than 10km from the line means an initial sort-out of the field; at least one favourite could lose the race here. The finish is made for Julian Alaphilippe, so France will expect a win and yellow jersey.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/28/tour-de-france-2023-stage-by-stage-guide-to-this-years-race">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The whole voice cast is excellent in DreamWorks’ first major release to feature a titular female hero, about a family of mythical sea beasts</p><p>High school is hell, especially if you’re from a family of mythical sea beasts attempting to blend in on land. That’s the coming-of-age context for this latest fantastical fable from DreamWorks Animation, the studio behind Shrek. Ruby (Lana Condor) is an ordinary modern teenager – save for the gills she hides under her polo neck – so all she wants is to go to prom with her friends. Even if prom is “a post-colonial, patriarchal construct”. But this year’s dance will be held on a boat, and Ruby’s mother (Toni Collette) has issued strict instructions to stay out of the sea. An act of rebellion is inevitable, resulting in some alarming physical changes, a family fallout and a Kaiju-eque clash of the underwater titans. All the normal teenage stuff.</p><p>Pixar’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/07/turning-red-review-pandas-and-pop-music-collide-in-solid-pixar-caper">Turning Red </a>certainly had a neater metaphor for puberty’s metamorphoses, but in lieu of originality this movie boasts some attractively tactile animation – the Gillmans’ slimy seaweed breakfast looks good enough to eat – and an excellent voice cast.

<p>They were outcasts in a town full of jocks, idly playing music to tiny crowds, and then broke up. But after their emotional songwriting became massively influential, they explain the weirdness of being back together</p><p>American Football didn’t intend for a dilapidated student house in Urbana, Illinois to become a cult musical landmark. As with much of the band’s career, it just happened. They’d chosen the now iconic photo of the white-panelled building to feature on the cover of their 1999 self-titled album at random – it captured the vibe of the town they’d just finished college in and the photographer, also a student at the time, was cheap. But when the record unexpectedly caught on years later, 704 W High Street became an indie monument, prompting pilgrimages from fans across the world and warranting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Football_House">its own Wikipedia page</a>. “It was just dumb luck,” says guitarist Steve Holmes, now 46. “It kind of took on a life of its own.”</p><p>So when rumours of its imminent demolition emerged last year, the band made a drunken pact with the label and original photographer to buy the house. “We were just joking, and then it sort of came together,” says vocalist Mike Kinsella, laughing. “I don’t know who, a week or two later, was like: shall we buy that house for real? Like, sober?” The sale went through last month.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/28/we-were-naive-and-nerdy-no-one-cared-about-us-how-american-football-became-indie-legends-against-the-odds">Continue reading...</a>

During a long overdue renewal process for the national team, the tournament in Australia and New Zealand may be the last one for Marta, the legendary No 10 often regarded as the best women’s football player in history. She is the top scorer in the history of World Cups with 17 goals and hopes to increase that number after her side open their campaign on 24 July.</p><p>Younger players in Pia Sundhage’s squad are not only eager to win the title for Marta, but also to demand improvements to the women’s game in Brazil. They are aware that what they achieve on the pitch will reflect on how the game is viewed by the public, the federation and young girls everywhere. Their hope is that, after this World Cup, the women’s game will see more investments and visibility than ever, so that Brazil will catch up with the European leagues and the National Women’s Soccer League in the US.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/28/how-good-are-brazil-how-far-can-they-go-womens-world-cup">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Frank and Monica Woll bought two beautiful islands in the Florida Keys only to see storms and rising waters wash away much of it away. Then they got serious</p><p>When Frank and Monica Woll bought two tiny islands in the Florida Keys in 2016 for their semi-retirement, they considered themselves privileged caretakers rather than owners. The day they arrived on Molasses Key, twin islands encircled by the turquoise-blue waters of the Florida Straits, a dolphin swam beside their boat. Already resident were scores of pelicans, anhingas, egrets, herons and numerous other species of birds in a plethora of mangrove trees.</p><p>Then came the hurricanes: Irma in 2017, and Ian last year. Today the trees, and the birds, are mostly gone. The storms, combined with rising sea levels, have stripped about one-fifth of the islands’ land mass.</p><p>Frank and Monica Woll sit on a branch that used to be over firm ground</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/28/a-couples-quixotic-quest-to-save-their-drowning-island-one-rock-at-a-time">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Riverside Studios, London<br /></strong>Spattered with blood and brains, this blend of cabaret and cosplay brings together Quentin Tarantino’s career highlights with flashes of divine inspiration</p><p>Children of the 1970s may recall the oddball charms of Bugs Bunny Meets the Superheroes, a stage show starring Warner Bros characters never normally seen in the same frame: Wonder Woman teamed up with Tweety to foil Yosemite Sam; Road Runner exited stage left pursued by the Riddler. That mix-and-match spirit lives on, albeit spattered with blood and brains, in Tarantino Live, a blend of cabaret, rock gig and Secret Cinema-style professional cosplay. The show, adapted by Anderson Davis (who also directs) and Sumie Maeda, mashes together <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/quentintarantino">Quentin Tarantino</a>’s films and their soundtracks to create a mega-mix of songs, speeches and severed ears.</p><p>In front of a raggedy screen that might have been torn from one of Tarantino’s beloved grindhouses, the evening begins with a Charles Manson disciple delivering the climactic monologue from Once Upon a Time in Hollywood about kids growing up watching murder on TV. He is interrupted by a figure on the balcony, dressed like a Reservoir Dog but bellowing Tim Roth’s dialogue from Pulp Fiction, who promptly guns him down. As a six-strong surf-rock band accompanies the action from scaffolding on either side of the stage, the actors spill on to the floor, cracking whips and swinging swords so close to the audience that they almost slice the foam from the tops of our beers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/28/tarantino-live-review-riverside-studios-london">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sega and Nintendo are releasing new games within days of each other this October, both nostalgic callbacks to the era of 2D platformers. Can they push the genre forward?</p><p><strong>• <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2021/nov/24/sign-up-for-pushing-buttons-keza-macdonalds-weekly-look-at-the-world-of-gaming">Don’t get Pushing Buttons delivered to your inbox? Sign up here</a></strong></p><p>Rivalry is a vital element of fandom. Whether its punks v rockers, Star Trek v Star Wars or Marvel v DC, subcultures have always defined themselves by what they’re not as much as what they are. Which is why I’m secretly delighted that Sega and Nintendo are apparently releasing their new Sonic and Mario games within days of each other this October. Both Super Mario Bros Wonder and Sega Superstars are nostalgic callbacks to the era of 2D platforming. Both games allow players to select from a range of classic characters and take on the rich, lushly colourful environments in cooperative modes, and both supplement the retro aesthetics with new abilities. Mario can transform into an elephant and use his trunk to batter enemies. Sonic can harness chaos emerald power to, say, transform into a watery version of himself so that he can swim up waterfalls.</p><p>After visiting the Summer Games Fest in Los Angeles earlier this month, I am thrilled to hear other attendees vividly debating the merits of the two titles. At the Summer Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago in 1991, Sega made its rivalry with Nintendo the theme of its stand, where the Mega Drive console (known as Genesis in the US) was being shown to American audiences for the first time. Visitors could watch a video demo of Sonic the Hedgehog playing side-by-side with Super Mario World on a big CRT monitor in the centre of the space. While the latter was sedate, comfortable and somewhat childish, Sonic pelted across the screen like a comet, synth-rock blaring. Famously, when tech reporters tried to talk to Sega about the much smaller colour palette of the Mega Drive hardware compared to the Super Nintendo, Sega’s then head of marketing Al Nilsen would point at the games running side by side and yell: “Which has more colours? Can you tell? Nobody cares!”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jun/28/pushing-buttons-sonic-the-hedgehog-super-mario-bros-2d-sega-nintendo">Continue reading...</a>

## Y/N by Esther Yi review – in the maze of parasocial love

<p>A woman falls for a K-pop star at a distance in this thoughtful romance for the online age</p><p>Adrift in Berlin, the narrator of Esther Yi’s intricate debut novel works as a copywriter for a business selling canned artichoke hearts. Her job, she informs us, “required [her] to credibly infuse the vegetable with the ability to feel romantic love for its consumer”. She has a sort-of boyfriend, Masterson, though she introduces herself at parties as his adoptive sister, not to shock so much as to indicate the true psychological state of their relationship. Masterson cannot bring himself to fall in love with her, a state of terminal indecisiveness our narrator responds to by falling in love with someone else. When her flatmate Vavra offers her a spare ticket to the first ever Berlin concert by K-pop idols the Pack of Boys, she is initially indifferent. “But this concert will change your life,” her friend insists. What ensues is not change so much as an overthrow of her previous existence.</p><p>The first generation of internet novels was preoccupied with technology: the novelty of artificial realities, the threat of surveillance, the confusion caused by covert communication and multiple identities. Twenty years on and digital technology is quotidian. Novelists are if anything even more obsessed with the internet, but what fascinates is societal impact, the ever hazier boundary between the online and the real. Recent years have seen a slew of narratives, notably from younger writers – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/nov/01/how-to-refocus-the-spotlight-on-female-writers-joyce-maynard-olivia-sudjic" title="">Olivia Sudjic</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/feb/04/fake-accounts-by-lauren-oyler-review-internet-secrets-and-lies" title="">Lauren Oyler</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jun/25/im-a-fan-by-sheena-patel-review-a-brutal-brilliant-debut" title="">Sheena Patel</a> – all deeply concerned with the act of seeing and of being seen. For the narrator of Y/N, the love she feels for Moon, the youngest of the Boys, is felt by her as more real and urgent than the pallid, almost two-dimensional interactions of her mundane experience.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/28/yn-by-esther-yi-review-in-the-maze-of-parasocial-love">Continue reading...</a>

## La Syndicaliste review – Isabelle Huppert is fascinating in blood-boiling injustice drama

<p>French film about real-life trade union whistleblower and rape survivor Maureen Kearney, accused of inventing her assault</p><p>‘My name is Maureen Kearney. I didn’t lie. I didn’t make anything up.” This French drama about a blood-boiling real-life case of injustice is the story of whistleblower and rape survivor Maureen Kearney, who for four years lived with a criminal record: falsely convicted of wasting police time, accused of inventing her rape. It’s a political thriller that tells the story matter-of-factly, and is perhaps a little lacking in the pace department. But Isabelle Huppert carries it along with a performance every bit as gripping as you’d expect. (Kearney is actually Irish, but has lived and worked in France since the mid 1980s; Huppert plays her as French).</p><p>Adapted from a book by investigative journalist Caroline Michel-Aguirre, this is a film of two halves, beginning with the whistleblowing. It’s 2011, and Kearney is a powerful trade union official, going into battle for the 50,000 staff at French nuclear engineering giant Areva in her armour of full makeup and blond hair so immaculately blow-dried it could deflect arrows. Kearney has the trade minister’s number in her phone and can summon President Sarkozy to a meeting. (Rumour has it he called her “a hysteric in a skirt”.) She turns whistleblower after being handed documents revealing secret plans to sell off France’s nuclear technology to China.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/28/la-syndicaliste-review-isabelle-huppert-is-fascinating-in-blood-boiling-injustice-drama">Continue reading...</a>

<p>While some analysts have argued that Putin’s rule was never truly threatened, Putin’s actions suggest he believed otherwise</p><p>Days after Russia extricated itself from its biggest domestic political crisis in decades, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Wagner mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin continue to deal with the reverberations. Amid the uncertainties, this much is clear: the saga has produced no winners, only losers. Belarus’s president Aleksandr Lukashenko <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/06/27/lukashenko-prigozhin-wagner-group-mutiny-russia-putin/">put it well</a>, even as he drew attention to his role as peacemaker: “I asked people not to make a hero out of me, neither out of me, nor out of Putin, nor out of Prigozhin.”</p><p>For Putin, the consequences of the turmoil are obvious. The Wagner group’s unimpeded march to within 200kms (127 miles) of Moscow took Russia’s military and intelligence services by surprise and exposed the Russian system writ large as utterly inept – a far cry from the image of competence and strength that Putin has cultivated assiduously since rising to the presidency in 1999. Wagner’s capture of Rostov – a city of a million and the headquarters of the southern military district – and its northward march toward the capital along the M4 highway left Russia’s strongman looking like a hapless bystander. That, at minimum, tarnished his image – an essential ingredient of his overweening power.</p><p>Rajan Menon is the director of the grand strategy program at Defense Priorities, a professor emeritus at the Colin Powell School for Civic and Global Leadership at the City College of New York, and the co-author of Conflict in Ukraine: The Unwinding of the Post-Cold War Order</p><p>Daniel R DePetris is a fellow at Defense Priorities and a syndicated foreign affairs columnist for the Chicago Tribune and Newsweek</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2023/jun/28/russian-coup-vladimir-putin-wagner-ukraine-war">Continue reading...</a>

Not just his own trauma, because he has obviously got enough mileage out of that elsewhere, but the trauma of a group best described as “world baddies”. As Bloomberg wrote, the concept of the show was as follows: “Harry would interview a procession of controversial guests, such as Vladimir Putin, Mark Zuckerberg and Donald Trump, about their early formative years and how those experiences resulted in the adults they are today.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/28/terrible-ideas-tedious-shows-zero-talent-meghan-and-harrys-trainwreck-podcast-career">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The EM Forster adaptation was graced with an awkward but dreamily romantic performance from Sands</p><p>The late Julian Sands had a long and active career. But I’m not alone, at the very mention of his name, in being brought back, with melancholy and reverie, to one particular work: the Merchant Ivory adaptation of EM Forster’s A Room With a View. The film is what brought Sands, and his co-star Helena Bonham Carter, their first fame; the latter was just 18 when she made it. It is adored by many because it is a perfectly made, beautifully acted and pitch-perfect thing altogether, all irradiated by enough of Forster’s irony to spare it the fate of over-earnestness. But more than that, it is adored because – especially if you first saw it, like me, as a teenager – it is the sweetest and most ardent evocation of what we all grapple with as we reach the brink of adulthood: who we really are, what we really want, whom to love, how to be.</p><p>I read a lot of Forster, as did my friends, growing up in north Staffordshire in the 1980s – probably, to be fair, as a direct result of the trickle of Merchant Ivory adaptations of his novels. My copy is marked 27 June 1989, in neat schoolgirl handwriting, which must be around the same time as I saw the film, which had come out in 1985; Bonham Carter is only six years older than me.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/28/room-with-a-view-the-film-that-launched-julian-sandss-career-and-changed-my-life">Continue reading...</a>

Towards the door is a huge bottle of Courvoisier given to him by somebody he can’t remember. The office overlooks a huge garden with its helipad and attached forest. Hearn doesn’t understand the concept of small. He is a giant of a man, mega-successful, motor-mouthed, stonkingly wealthy, with a desire to best the opposition that verges on the pathological.</p><p>Take the relatively understated scoreboard on his cabinet, pitting him against his father, Barry – the founder of their Matchroom Sport empire and a rival for the title of Britain’s leading sport promoter, though he is now officially retired. “Boxing skills, 1-0 to Eddie. Snooker skills, 1-0 to Barry. Instagram followers, 62 to Barry, 1.2 million to Eddie.” And on it goes. “Amazon book reviews, 33 to Barry; 1,370 for Eddie. Height: Barry 6ft 2in, Eddie 6ft 5in. Golf handicap: Barry 19, Eddie 15.” The final score gives Eddie a 5-4 victory.

<p>Latest updates: Daisy Goodwin says she struggled to make official complaint about Korski allegedly groping her in Downing Street 10 years ago</p><p><strong>Claire Coutinho</strong>, the education minister, was giving interviews on behalf of the government this morning. In the past she has praised Daniel Korski’s “clear vision for London”, but this morning she said her support for him was “on pause” given the allegations against him. She said:</p><p>I would say I’d be on pause at the moment because lots of things are happening.</p><p>Yes, because I think we need to see what’s happened.</p><p>But, at the same time, this is an allegation. He’s roundly denied it.</p><p><strong>Goodwin suggested that other women might come forward with allegations about Korski. </strong>She told the Today programme:</p><p>Since I wrote my piece, I have been contacted by other women with some very interesting stories, which clearly I can’t talk about for legal reasons. But I feel entirely justified in having written the piece and naming him.</p><p><strong>Goodwin firmly rejected a suggestion that she might have misinterpreted what happend. </strong>Asked by <strong>Martha Kearney</strong> if there had been any ambiguity about what happened, <strong>Goodwin</strong> replied:</p><p>I’m really surprised you’re asking me that, Martha. Yes, it happened to me 10 years ago, but when something like this happens to you, you know that it happened to you because you were there, you felt it, you felt amazed, shocked and rather humiliated.

## Football transfer rumours: Mbappé to Liverpool or Manchester United?

<p>Today’s fluff is caught somewhere in time</p><p>Could the Premier League be about to land the big one? If reports in France are to be believed, then <strong>Kylian Mbappé</strong> really will leave PSG this summer. Now, of course, and this has been trailed for some years now, it’s Real Madrid who are expected to sign him.</p><p>But the Rumour Mill loves to fantasise, and just imagine Mbapps speeding down the wing for <strong>Liverpool</strong> or <strong>Manchester United</strong>. Mbappé v Haaland: imagine the Super Sunday hype and excitement? Our league! But what about the money – £240m, since you ask? Both of those teams are loaded with talent in his position, and that it’s elsewhere in the team the ailing north-west giants need strengthening? Well, what about it, and what is the transfer window if not a voyage of fantasy and make-believe? Stars in your eyes, little one, where do you go to dream, as Buck’s Fizz once had it …</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/28/football-transfer-rumours-kylian-mbappe-to-liverpool-or-manchester-united">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Almost 50 years after his death, an official biography and a forthcoming album of artists reinterpreting his songs are to be celebrated – as is the fact that he still remains an enigma</p><p>Every so often, the estate of Nick Drake receives a rather unusual request: would the reclusive musician, who died in 1974, be available to play some festival dates? The requests are usually from abroad, says Cally Callomon, who manages the estate along with Drake’s sister Gabrielle, although he does recall a British culture show making a similar ask in the early 00s. Gabrielle once jokingly suggested sending one of her actor friends along to perform as Nick, although “I explained that this might get the booker fired,” laughs Callomon.</p><p>This anecdote tells you a lot about the enduring appeal of the British folk musician, who has been repeatedly discovered by new generations of music fans ever since his death from an overdose of antidepressant tablets almost 50 years ago. His music sounds so fresh that people assume he’s still alive.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/28/he-tells-you-its-all-right-to-be-miserable-why-nick-drake-enchants-every-new-generation">Continue reading...</a>

(He’s an old hippy; you could imagine him played by Mark Rylance in the movie of his life.)</p><p>Booklovers will instantly feel at home in this documentary and in Tannenbaum’s store – a warm inviting hang-out, a little shabby with comfy armchairs to settle down in, children curled up on the floor noses in books. It’s clearly a bookshop full of discoveries, one of those you pop into for a browse and walk out lugging a carrier bag full of books. There’s even a wine bar in the corner, Get Lit, opened by Tannenbaum in memory of a wine-loving Czech friend who’d escaped the Nazis, then lived to the age of 90.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/28/hello-bookstore-review-indie-bookshop-owners-story-is-the-perfect-page-turner">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A son’s profoundly moving account of his parents’ survival under Nazi and Soviet rule</p><p>Mirjam and Ludwik were both born into prosperous families. Both had happy early childhoods. Like millions of others, both had their lives shattered by the second world war. Mirjam was caught with her mother and sisters in the occupied Netherlands, living under increasingly oppressive Nazi rule before being moved to the Dutch holding camp for Jews at Westerbork, and then Belsen. Ludwik, who grew up in Poland, was exiled to eastern Kazakhstan by the Soviets with his mother, where they lived through a Siberian winter with little food and no shelter. Both somehow survived through a combination of willpower, help from distant family and moments of miraculous luck in a sea of misfortune. They ended up, through circuitous means, in Britain, met, married and lived a blissfully quiet life in Hendon.</p><p>Like many survivors, neither wrote their story. They did not want to be defined by the worst of their experiences. As Mirjam said: “I think of myself as a person, a wife and mother first, and a survivor last.” Nor did they realise how incredible their journeys would seem to the rest of us.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/28/hitler-stalin-mum-and-dad-by-daniel-finkelstein-review-escape-from-tyranny">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An effective ban on the testing of confiscated substances will needlessly expose festival-goers to harm</p><p>In August 2019, at 3.42am on a Saturday morning at Leeds festival, 17-year-old Anya Buckley, from Oldham, collapsed and died from heart failure after taking MDMA, ketamine and cocaine. Later a pathologist concluded that Anya’s death was caused by mixed drug toxicity, with the court hearing that the ecstasy was particularly strong. “We are tormented by the fact that Anya’s death was avoidable,” her aunt, Anna Short, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/mar/07/family-of-teenager-who-died-call-for-more-drug-checking-at-festivals">told the Guardian</a> at the time. “If people are made clearly aware that drugs which are toxic are in circulation, then it can help them make more informed choices.”</p><p>Anya could have been many of us – it’s pretty normal for people to take party drugs with their mates at music festivals. Her death certainly doesn’t exist in a bubble. Between 2017 and 2021, there were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/jun/07/mps-call-for-drug-safety-testing-amid-fears-of-rise-in-summer-festival-deaths">at least 14 reported deaths</a> among young people from drug use at festivals in England. In 2018, one such person was Georgia Jones, who died aged 18 at Mutiny festival in Hampshire after taking dangerously high-strength MDMA. “I honestly believe that if Georgia had been able to test her substance and given some advice on how to remain safe, she might have come home alive that day,” her mother said after her death.</p><p>Daisy Jones is a writer and the author of All the Things She Said</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/28/drug-testing-festivals-saves-lives-home-office">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Set in a northern seaside town, this show-stopping second novel is a bravura deconstruction of our voyeuristic love for true crime</p><p>When Eliza Clark’s debut novel came out with an indie publisher in 2020, nobody imagined that her second would be among the most eagerly awaited of 2023. Her rise from obscurity to literary celebrity began when fans on TikTok made <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/boy-parts-9781910312636" title="">Boy Parts</a> a cult hit. It was complete when, a few months ago, Granta magazine named the 29-year-old author one of the UK’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/15/grantas-best-of-young-british-novelists-meet-the-class-of-23" title="">best 20 novelists under the age of 40</a>.</p><p>The story of Irina, a photographer who recruits men to pose for sexually humiliating images, Boy Parts lobbed an unpinned grenade of tactless comedy at subjects most authors would treat carefully, if at all. Irina is a genuinely troubling narrator: an abuse victim who is also dishonest, manipulative and an abuser herself, she occasionally resembles a misogynistic stereotype. (The scene where, in need of a car, she borrows one by gleefully blackmailing a man who recently raped her, is as discomfiting as it is hilarious.) To its many fans Boy Parts was a taboo-busting examination of gender politics and the paradoxical effects of trauma. Others shared the view of Irina’s art teacher: “You’re not making art here; you’re making porn … The world doesn’t need more nasty, voyeuristic photography, does it?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/28/penance-by-eliza-clark-review-art-or-porn">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From ferret racing to shinkicking, we round up some of the country’s most eccentric sporting events. Oddly, cricket isn’t among them …</p><p>All modern sports can seem faintly ridiculous to the non-affiliated. How on earth did anyone come up with cricket? Or two packs of eight sturdy warriors all hugging each other, crouching down and locking heads before a pointy ball is introduced among them? It always surprises me that one player, ears tattered from similar battles, doesn’t struggle loose and walk away, shouting: “I’m sorry, I can’t. This is too weird.”</p><p>Behind all the bizarre practices of our favourite sports, the offside rules, the silly points and forty-loves, it’s obvious that what we want from our sport is fun physical exercise and the chance to test ourselves against others. If this can be achieved in a beautiful place with the opportunity for a post-match debrief in an excellent pub, then all the better. So here we have the alternative sporting calendar: games and challenges that may seem a little bizarre at first but take place in great locations around Britain.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/jun/28/10-weird-sporting-events-in-the-uk">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A married couple’s attempts to kickstart their sex life are unfunny and unconvincing, and will leave you groaning in despair</p><p>This film may leave you moaning in despair, groaning in agony, screaming in irritation at the sheer embarrassing awfulness of entire scenes. It’s a comedy directed by Sean Garrity about a married couple who decide to kickstart their nonexistent sex life after packing their kids off to camp. A smarter, sharper film might have explored what happens next in an otherwise happy marriage when the spark goes out. Instead, the comedy here is as broad as it gets, with some wildly unconvincing and unhilarious set-pieces.</p><p>Emma (Emily Hampshire) is an art teacher who is married to her childhood sweetheart Josh (Jonas Chernick). Ten years of raising small kids has killed off their sex life. In one of the film’s few decent jokes Josh compares his feelings about sex with Emma to her chicken stir-fry: “I don’t <em>love</em> it, but I eat it.” So they decide to spice things up, beginning with a disastrous threesome. Next, for reasons that make not one iota of sense, they book a night out at a sex club, where the clientele turns out to be a bunch of wrinkly old men in bondage leather (a bit of an easy target, that). Perhaps the funniest moments come when the pair try doing it on ecstasy, with a dozen bottles of water on the coffee table in case of dehydration.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/28/the-end-of-sex-review-couples-sexual-misadventures-aim-to-relight-fading-fires">Continue reading...</a>

## How volcano magma could help meet green economy’s demand for metal

<p>Metals could be extracted from magmatic brines while producing geothermal power at same time, say scientists</p><p>One hurdle in the transition to a low carbon future is the huge increase in demand for metals associated with renewable energy technologies. By 2050, it is anticipated lithium production will need to have increased by tenfold, cobalt by sixfold and silver by half as much again. Even the most efficient recycling system cannot meet this demand, and conventional mining practices are energy-intensive and environmentally damaging.</p><p>Some mining companies are looking to the deep sea, but as well as being technically challenging, this risks irreversible damage to unique ocean environments. Writing in <a href="https://geoscientist.online/sections/features/mining-the-brine/">Geoscientist</a>, Olivia Hogg and Jon Blundy suggest harnessing the power of volcanoes instead. Volcanic magmas are rich in metals, with active volcanoes such as Mount Etna in Italy releasing about 20 tonnes of copper and 10kg of gold a day in volcanic gases. Extracting metals from volcanic gas is implausible, but mining it from the underlying hot magmatic brines does have real potential. Metals are super-concentrated in these brines and the hot fluids could be used to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/may/19/british-energy-iceland-volcano-geothermal-power">produce geothermal power</a>, potentially making the mining process carbon neutral.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jun/28/how-volcano-magma-could-help-meet-green-economy-demand-for-metal">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>28 June 1973</strong>: The novel centres around a ‘hoodlum scientist’ who has lots of nasty theories connecting the internal combustion engine with sadism</p><p>I have never been a JG Ballard fan, but I can see why other people are. His new novel, Crash, is a grindingly earnest and scrupulous attempt to understand why we are all obsessed with accidents on the road, and why so many people die or are mutilated in car-crashes while the rest jaw piously about safety belts and speed limits.</p><p>If I say that Ballard would probably equate the safety belt with bondage and/or the chastity belt then you’ll maybe get the drift, or skid, of this horrific and certainly memorable exercise in controlled surrealism. It concerns the narrator’s involvement with a young woman doctor whose husband he has killed in a car crash, and with Vaughan a “hoodlum scientist” who has a lot of nasty theories connecting the internal combustion engine with sadism, and likes to speculate about the effects of accident mutilation on film actresses.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/28/jg-ballard-crash-exercise-in-controlled-surrealism-1973">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It is said you should never wash a mushroom, add salt to pulses in the pan or cook with olive oil. But accepted wisdom isn’t always right ...</p><p>There comes a point in life when you should start to question the big things – to probe accepted ideas around religion, politics, and the best way to cook pasta. Forget what you learned at your mother’s knee, what it says on the packet, or what you once heard a celebrity chef say on Saturday Kitchen … or rather, check it for accuracy. As the saying goes, there’s more than one way to crack an egg … but I maintain the most efficient is to tap it against a flat surface and then pull it apart over a bowl. Here are a few other culinary facts that might come as a surprise.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/28/10-food-rules-you-should-ignore-felicity-cloake">Continue reading...</a>

## The road to Mecca is fraught with challenges – but there’s nothing like the hajj pilgrimage to turn hearts | Ali Hammoud for the Conversation

<p>When pilgrims don the hajj attire, they discard more than their clothes. Nationality, race and socioeconomic status are tossed to the wayside </p><p>Millions of men, women and children converged on Mecca this week for the hajj pilgrimage. The Saudi government says it will be the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/25/largest-hajj-pilgrimage-in-history-begins-in-saudi-arabia">largest crowd ever</a> for the pilgrimage.</p><p>The hajj pilgrimage is, at its core, a pilgrimage towards God. This presents a paradox of sorts. If God is beyond time and space, then what is the purpose of travelling to a particular place? Is God not present now, everywhere?</p><p>Our sense of the divine Presence is blunted. We need to find it focused on a particular place and, for the Muslim, that place is the Ka’ba at Mecca, which he has faced every time he prayed and to which he now journeys in pilgrimage.</p><p>There were tens of thousands of pilgrims, from all over the world. They were of all colours, from blue-eyed blondes to black-skinned Africans. But we were all participating in the same ritual, displaying a spirit of unity and brotherhood that my experiences in America had led me to believe never could exist between the white and non-white.</p><p>In my thirty-nine years on this earth, the Holy City of Mecca had been the first time I had ever stood before the Creator of All and felt like a complete human being.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/28/the-road-to-mecca-is-fraught-with-challenges-but-theres-nothing-like-the-hajj-pilgrimage-to-turn-hearts">Continue reading...</a>
