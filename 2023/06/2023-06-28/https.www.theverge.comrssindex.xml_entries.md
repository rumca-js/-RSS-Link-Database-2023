  <p id="cZaSH3">Reddit is pressuring moderators who have set their subreddits to private to reopen their communities this week, according to messages seen by <em>The Verge</em>. The company has given moderators deadlines to lay out their plans for reopening but said that they can’t stay closed.</p>
<p id="lQdzJQ">The timeframes given generally indicate a deadline of sometime Thursday afternoon. Reddit was vague about the exact repercussions but seemed to suggest this was the final warning stage.</p>
<p id="F4wO9p">“This community remaining closed to its [millions of] members cannot continue” beyond a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/27/23776082/please-let-us-know-within-the-next-48-hours-if-you-plan-on-re-opening">the deadline</a>, the admin (Reddit employee) account ModCodeofConduct wrote in a note to one of the biggest Reddit communities that’s still private.</p>

  <p id="1KmCDD">Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says he’d “love” to get rid of console game exclusives but blames Sony for defining the market and competition. Nadella made the comments as part of testimony in <em>FTC v. Microsoft </em>today, discussing Microsoft’s cloud gaming strategy, internal gaming targets, and much more.</p>
<p id="Q3JBJ0">When discussing the ideal of Microsoft being focused on software across as many platforms as possible, Nadella was asked about Xbox exclusives. Here’s what he said:</p>
<blockquote><p id="AOXofe">If it was up to me I would love to get rid of the entire exclusives on consoles, but that’s not for me to define especially as a low share player in the console market. The dominant player there [Sony] has defined market competition using exclusives, so that’s the world we live in....</p></blockquote>

  <p id="owAymS">There’s a big debate happening in the self-driving car world: what’s the best way for these vehicles to see the world around them? Both Tesla and those autonomous taxi startups, like Waymo and Cruise, use powerful machine vision systems to help their cars navigate the world, but that’s where the similarities end. A Tesla’s view of the world is provided entirely by cameras, whereas Cruise and Waymo use an array of different kinds of sensors, most critically lidar. Short for “Light Detection and Ranging,” lidar systems use pulses of lasers to map the environment with impressive fidelity, though at a much higher cost. </p>

  <p id="7ebxyd">As part of its big wave of acquisitions, Microsoft considered adding Square Enix, the publisher behind the <em>Final Fantasy</em> series, to its Xbox portfolio. The news comes from internal documents released as part of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23768244/ftc-microsoft-activision-blizzard-case-news-announcements"><em>FTC v. Microsoft</em> hearings</a>, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/26/23774482/microsoft-sega-bungie-acquisition-targets-internal-email-xbox">previously revealed that Microsoft had considered other big names like Sega and Bungie</a>.</p>
<p id="aSVWiG">According to the documents, Microsoft had a number of reasons for being interested in Square Enix. Part of it was to bolster Xbox’s historically scant presence in Asian markets. There was another obvious reason: to add more content to drive growth of Xbox Game Pass through new blockbuster Square Enix releases as well as the company’s extensive back catalog.</p>

  <p id="4m8JVl">LG Electronics announced today it’s releasing a webcam for its TVs called the <a href="http://www.lgnewsroom.com/2023/06/lg-smart-cam-pairs-with-lg-tvs-to-deliver-a-smarter-more-interactive-experience/">LG Smart Cam</a> (VC23GA). It’s a $99 1080p camera with dual microphones, a physical privacy shutter, and support for webOS’s multi-view feature, which shows two apps in a split-screen view on the TV. The webcam is supported on any TV running webOS 22 or webOS 23.</p>
<p id="Tg8XlL">LG is pitching this camera as a way to do videoconferencing at home using the webOS RemoteMeeting app, LG’s web-based videoconferencing service. On the fitness side, it’s compatible with Exercite, which uses the webcam to analyze your movements and give you live feedback, and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fflexit.fit%2Fvirtualpt%2F&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2023%2F6%2F28%2F23776727%2Flg-tv-smart-cam-webcam-hd-fitness-video-calls" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Flexit</a>, a fitness platform with one-on-one wellness and exercise coaching.

  <p id="DcV62B">Technology craves a narrative but often has a short memory for history. As a publication that contributes to that — <em>The Verge</em> lives in the news cycle, after all — we wanted to praise the form of writing that lasts: the book. How else do we move forward if we can’t remember the past? So we set out with the audacious goal to define the best books about tech out there.</p>
<p id="wxt5KP">We were less interested in works that are supposedly influential and more in ones that have endured, with ideas that are still relevant today, stories that have captured something essential about technology, and writing that’s made us stand up in our seats. These books don’t project a single vision of what tech is but continue to challenge what it can be.</p>

Now, as part of its <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_3492">plans</a> to address security risks posed by climate change, the European Union is calling for talks on a potential international framework on how to treat deliberately atmosphere-altering technologies, AKA geoengineering.</p>
<p id="9sH9iY">The idea with geoengineering is to deploy new technologies that might be able to cool the planet down.

  <p id="fCCOAL">Microsoft is improving Windows 11’s support for the new passkey standard that aims to replace passwords with a more secure and convenient way of logging in. A recent <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/06/22/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-23486/">Insider Preview Build (23486)</a> now lets you use Windows Hello natively to create and sign in to supported applications and websites using passkeys, where you’ll be asked to prove your identity using a PIN, fingerprint, or face scan. </p>
<p id="XY2yGm">According to Microsoft, you can set up the feature by going to a website that’s added passkey support, creating a passkey in its settings, and then logging out to get the option to sign in with the new security method. On Edge or Chrome, the option to sign in with a passkey should be under the “Windows Hello or external security key” option....</p>

  <p id="7pkY3Q">DoorDash is making a big change to the way couriers get paid. In <a href="https://doordash.news/merchant/introducing-doordashs-biggest-app-updates-in-a-decade/">an announcement on Wednesday</a>, DoorDash says it will start giving couriers the ability to earn hourly rates on top of tips.</p>
<p id="naKkyu">With the update, couriers will now see the option to “earn by time,” which offers a guaranteed hourly minimum rate for the time they spend on making deliveries. According to DoorDash, the clock starts as soon as a courier accepts an order and ends when it’s dropped off. </p>

  <p id="V7BOdX">HMD’s Nokia G42 is the company’s latest smartphone designed to be easy for users to repair from spare parts and kits sold in partnership with iFixit. The purple version of the device with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage is going on sale in the UK from today for £199 (around $255), and will be available in Europe for €249. There’ll also be a model with 4GB of RAM sold in select European markets for around €229, but there’s no sign of either model coming to the US for now.</p>
<p id="7aZBfa">Like the Nokia G22 announced earlier this year, HMD is focusing on making four key components easy to replace if they break or wear out over time: the phone’s battery, screen, charging port, and back cover. HMD plans to make spare parts available from iFixit for five...</p>

  <p id="FS9jcJ">Google is laying off employees at Waze, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/27/google-cuts-jobs-at-waze-as-it-continues-to-merge-mapping-products.html">CNBC reported on Tuesday</a>. The company is moving Waze over to Google’s ads system, and that change will mean cuts at Waze in “sales, marketing, operations and analytics,” Chris Phillips, VP and GM of Google’s Geo unit, wrote in an email seen by the publication. Phillips’ email didn’t indicate the number of jobs that would be cut at Waze, which has more than 500 staffers, according to CNBC. </p>
<p id="Lbb12g">Waze confirmed the layoffs in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>. “Google remains deeply committed to growing Waze’s unique brand, its beloved app and its thriving community of volunteers and users,” Caroline Bourdeau, Waze’s head of PR, said in the statement. “In order to create a better, more seamless long term...</p>
