## Show HN: PFAS.report – Measure the forever chemicals in your blood via Quest

<p>Hey HN<p>We made a site that let's anyone measure the forever chemicals in their blood with the gold standard LC-MS/MS blood serum test at Quest Diagnostics.<p>If you're a firefighter, plant worker, planning to become pregnant or just someone who lives in an area with contaminated drinking water, check it out.<p>I live in Santa Cruz. Here are my results:<p>My lab findings: <a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/mpsh87/image/upload/v1687923285/lab_results_redacted_final_e28vh4.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://res.cloudinary.com/mpsh87/image/upload/v1687923285/l...</a><p>My total PFAS calculation: <a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/mpsh87/image/upload/v1687923482/pfas_report_calculator_ntal6v.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://res.cloudinary.com/mpsh87/image/upload/v1687923482/p...</a><p>NASEM clinical recommendations based on Total PFAS: <a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/mpsh87/image/upload/c_scale,dpr_2.0,h_1200/v1687923501/NASEM_clinical_recommendations_stcvq9.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://res.cloudinary.com/mpsh87/image/upload/c_scale,dpr_2...</a><p>The goal is to be under 2 ng/mL. I'm 10.86.<p>Honestly I was a bit surprised by my result and am currently deciding what to do next.<p>There's some research out of Australia indicating blood donation/phlebotomy is effective at removing it (<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2790905" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle...</a>) from the body. Fluorochemicals seem to bind to the albumin in the blood. I might try that.<p>Right now the site only works at Quest locations in California, but we're looking to expand to other states soon.<p>If you're local, the site is live and you can order the test right now. Results are currently taking between 11 and 18 days.<p>Thanks for reading my post.</p>

## Show HN: Litnerd (YC S21) – Kids Book Club Meets Gaming

<p>Hi HN! Anisa here from Litnerd (<a href="https://www.litnerd.com">https://www.litnerd.com</a>). We’re a reading club for kids. It’s been two years since our first HN launch and I am back today to share some updates we're extremely excited about.<p>Litnerd is an online reading club program with a weekly live meetup to help students make reading a lifelong habit. Think of us as “book club meets gaming”. New books go live weekly, and each book has movie adaptations, music, reading courseware, mini lessons with a virtual teacher and worksheets. There are reading tournaments every month to recognize the top reader. The goal of our app is to create a fun and engaging way of cultivating a child’s natural curiosity by bringing the subject matter to life (movie adaptation of books with real actors, cartoon animation, enacted experiences) and through gamification—our community is obsessed with earning “Litcoin” (yup, we actually did this and it really works!) and winning monthly tournaments.<p>Here’s a video that shows how Litnerd works: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSVjWi-rE8k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSVjWi-rE8k</a>. Here’s a video I made for parents, summarizing what’s new with our product: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mniVUWx6tvM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mniVUWx6tvM</a>, and here is an older video that gives you a quick demo: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1wdk9ofb5w">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1wdk9ofb5w</a>.<p>When we did our Launch HN back in 2021 (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28300640">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28300640</a>), we got two prominent themes of feedback. One was B2C access—you asked us to open the app for parents to buy directly rather than selling it only to schools. The other was that it gave you massive Diamond Age vibes. I read the Diamond Age. It gave me chills. Thank you!<p>Originally, Litnerd was only sold to schools, and teachers had to administer the product in classroom time. We were also streaming live actors into the classroom to reenact books and build interest and fun.<p>Now, our program is a standalone web app used by both schools and parents (B2C access is live—thanks HN!) We no longer stream live actors into classrooms, but rather have films and cartoons in-app to bring the book to life, all filmed in our Brooklyn studio. We also have original soundtracks for each book, in both the app and on Spotify.<p>Our product is now used by kids primarily after school hours—and the average kid is spending 30 minutes in the app daily! Parents in our first B2C cohort commented on how this is the only educational app their child wants to use without being pushed by a parent/teacher. With just 4 months of Litnerd usage, students improved comprehension by 72% and phonics improvement by 48%.
Your child is auto-enrolled in a cohort when they sign up. They are also auto-enrolled in the current reading tournament of the month. The goal is to earn the most amount of Litcoin so that you can win tournaments and go shopping in the Litnerd Store. To earn Litcoin, your child does 3 things. First, they complete at least 15 minutes of daily reading. Second, they have daily reading tasks, such as quizzes and worksheets to build vocabulary and comprehension. Third, they attend a weekly live (virtual) meetup with their cohort.<p>Why a live meetup? The Litnerd Reading Club is a <i>community</i> experience with a weekly meetup (if you miss the weekly meetup, you miss out on a lot of Litcoin earning potential). This ensures kids using the app feel like they are in a classroom or pod experience. Each child is entered into a cohort when they enroll, and each week your child will meet virtually with other kids in their cohort and discuss the book they are reading with our special guest (which might be the author of the book, an actor from the movie adaptation of the book, a literacy coach, etc). Here is a video to show what happens in these cohort sessions: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOcybwyGelo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOcybwyGelo</a><p>We have so much more to build out our version of the Primer from Diamond Age and inspire millions of kids, just like Nell, to fall in love with learning. We are working on turning the entire app into a game-ux interface, where kids can explore different cities in the app and read books/go through materials at their own pace and that the app will adapt to their interests. We also have our eye on adding other subjects and older grades in the future.<p>As always, I would love to hear your thoughts and ideas on how you foster reading amongst your children! I am excited to hear your feedback and ideas to help us inspire the next generation of readers.</p>

## Launch HN: June (YC W21) – Product Analytics for B2B SaaS Companies
 - [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36505743](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36505743)
 - RSS feed: https://hnrss.org/frontpage

<p>Two and a half years ago my co-founder and I left our jobs on the product team at Intercom to try and build a startup. We went through YC and launched an analytics tool on top of Segment that allowed you to generate some pre-made reports for common product metrics (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26155327">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26155327</a>). We raised a seed round, then spent a year building templates of reports for startups.<p>After a year of building our product we tried to monetise and failed. Our free users weren’t willing to pay us money for individual reports.<p>Among the users we had, there were a handful of later stage B2B companies with few customers but a lot of revenue (one had 50 customers and $1m in annual revenue). These companies looked at their analytics in a different way. They cared a lot more about specific individual users than consumer apps do, and they spent a lot of time using our product.<p>After learning this we spent some time trying to understand the differences between product analytics for a B2C product versus a B2B one. We learned three main things that led us to pivot our company into building a product analytics tool for B2B SaaS companies:<p>(1) Most of the revenue in B2B products comes from a handful of customers. In Slack’s case, 500 customers out of 700,000 made up to 40% of revenue[1]!
(2) Most of the revenue B2B products make comes from expansion. Contracts start small and grow over time, as a company wins more trust and delivers value. This means that growing product usage among existing users, over time, draws in more users and more revenue.
(3) Product management in B2B is a lot less quantitative than in B2C. It is more a collaboration with Sales and Customer Success teams. The kind of insights you need from analytics are different. You need to know “Are our key customers adopting the new feature we launched?” and not “Does our new redesign improve activation by 2%?”<p>After learning these things we went back to the drawing board and rebuilt our product with them in mind. That is, we built a product analytics tool that (1) has automatically set up reports that allow you to track acquisition, activation, retention and feature usage; (2) supports measuring metrics both in terms of how many users or companies use your product; and (3) helps you answer common questions for your users like “Who used our product the most in the last 90 days?”, “Who tried our new feature once and never came back?”, “What’s our feature with the highest retention? How many people use it?”<p>This realization happened a year ago and we’ve now reached the point where more than a thousand B2B SaaS companies at seed and Series A use us every month.<p>We would love to get some feedback from the broader HN community!
