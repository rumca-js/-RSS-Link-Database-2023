<p>During the FTC-Microsoft trial, the head of Microsoft revealed that he would "love" to get rid of exclusive games, but it's something that the company has to do because of Sony.</p><p dir="ltr">According to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's testimony today (via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/28/23777585/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-console-exclusives-sony-xbox-competition">The Verge</a>), he said this while commenting on the company's strategies and plans for the future. When he was asked about games being exclusive to one platform, this is what he said:</p><p dir="ltr">"If it was up to me I would love to get rid of the entire exclusives on consoles, but that's not for me to define especially as a low-share player in the console market. The dominant player there [Sony] has defined market competition using exclusives, so that's the world we live in. I have no love for that world."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-ceo-says-he-would-love-to-get-rid-of-xbox-exclusives-but-cant-because-of-sony/1100-6515563/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Anthony Mackie is best known as the Marvel Cinematic Universe's Sam Wilson--formerly Falcon, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sam-wilson-confirmed-as-captain-america-for-new-movie-captain-america-new-world-order/1100-6505816/">now Captain America</a>.

"I had written them letters. I was trying to find a way to make them make Black Panther. And I wanted to be Black Panther because growing up I f*cking loved Black Panther."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/anthony-mackie-thought-he-would-be-playing-black-panther-in-the-mcu/1100-6515562/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Mojang has announced that it'll no longer use Reddit to post official updates for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/">Minecraft</a>. Going forward, the team will now use the <a href="https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us">Minecraft website</a> or another social media platform to give updates.</p><p>The news comes from Reddit user sliced_lime (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/minecrafts-devs-exit-its-7-million-strong-subreddit-after-reddits-ham-fisted-crackdown-on-protest/">PCGamer</a>). According to their Reddit bio, they are a "Minecraft developer," and is said to be Mikael Hedberg, a tech lead for the Java edition of the game. It's still unsure what platform Mojang might use, but GameSpot has contacted the company for comment. They state the reasoning for leaving the platform is largely due to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/reddit-is-cracking-down-on-third-party-apps-with-steep-price-increases/1100-6514728/">Reddits changes over its API</a>.

## Crash Team Rumble Review - A Fresh Spin

<p dir="ltr">There are few games that serve as better examples of the industry's changing landscape than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/crash-team-rumble/">Crash Team Rumble</a> (CTR). Once a single-player mascot platformer at the height of the genre's popularity, CTR takes the heroes and villains of Naughty Dog's, and later Activision's, series and reimagines it as a 4v4 multiplayer game with live-service elements. To some, that might sound like a myopic deathblow to a once-proud series. On the contrary, Crash Team Rumble is a fun and surprisingly tactical PvP game, albeit sometimes held back by oft-seen growing pains of games-as-a-service.</p><p dir="ltr">In Crash Team Rumble, two teams of four square off in platforming arenas that, at first glance, each look a bit like wide levels from a typical Crash game. Enjoyably, the controls and feel of the game perfectly capture those of traditional Crash games, too, making it an instantly recognizable experience in one's hands.</p><p dir="ltr">Though the game has just one mode at launch, it's designed very well. The goal is to score 2,000 wumpa fruit before the rival team does. To do this, players will spin over, slam onto, and slide into crates and loose wumpas all around the arena to collect them. Moving them to a goal area will, after a moment, score them for the team permanently. But the exciting chaos of CTR exists in this in-between space, and often even on the goals themselves.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/crash-team-rumble-review-a-fresh-spin/1900-6418083/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Secret Invasion Episode 2 Easter Eggs - 7 Things You Missed in 'Promises'

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4158950-secretinvasionepisode2eastereggas.jpg" /><br /><em>Gareth Gatrell/Marvel Studios</em><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Marvel's new spy thriller limited series Secret Invasion continued this week in its second episode as Nick Fury attempts to deal with the aftermath of the Skrull attack in Moscow--and as those rebel Skrulls make the next big move in their secret war of conquest against humanity.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Warning: This article contains major spoilers for the second episode of Marvel's Secret Invasion series on Disney+.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">This week's episode opened with a scene that, frankly, should have been used last week: Fury, in 1995 in the wake of the events of Captain Marvel, recruits a group of Skrulls to help him police Earth in exchange for giving the Skrulls a new home to live on (theirs was destroyed by the Kree). Gravik, the leader of the Skrull rebels in the present day, is in this scene as a boy--albeit a boy who's been through some rough stuff.</p><p dir="ltr">In the present, things are looking very dire. Nick Fury and Maria Hill (RIP) are catching the blame for the attack in Moscow that killed more than 2,000 people. In the wake of the attack, Gravik pulls a power move on the Skrull leadership and pulls the entire Skrull civilization on Earth into the war, with himself in charge. And it turns out that "the entire Skrull civilization on Earth" is actually basically all the Skrulls in the universe--millions of Skrulls, secretly posing as humans.</p><p dir="ltr">And, just for good measure, Jim "War Machine" Rhodes (Don Cheadle) fires Fury from his job--making the former leader of SHIELD officially a rogue operative. Fortunately, he's got a Skrull wife to go home to. But does he know she's a Skrull? (Of course he does.)</p><p dir="ltr">Let's get to those Easter eggs.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. Emperor Drogge</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4158930-secretinvasioneastereggsepisode2.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>When Talos tells Fury early in the episode that <em>all</em> the Skrulls came to Earth when he put out his call for refugees, he delivers one caveat: All the Skrulls showed up except for the ones at "Emperor Drogge's colony." This is a <em>fascinating</em> name drop. While there's no "Emperor Drogge" in the comics, there's an obscure Skrull character named Dro'ge Fenu Edu who was basically the Skrull equivalent of a nation's science minister. But this isn't just a cute and obscure reference. His significance is actually tied to a different Easter egg from near the end of the episode. So we'll do that one next.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. Those DNA samples the Skrulls have been collecting</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4158937-secretinvasionsuperskrullsdna.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Near the end of the episode, we see G'iah snooping around in parts of the secret Skrull base she's not supposed to be in--and she discovers that they're attempting to use alien DNA to enhance themselves and turn the rebels into Super-Skrulls. These DNA samples come from various corners of the MCU: Groot from Guardians of the Galaxy, a Frost Beast from the Thor movies, Thanos's lieutenant Black Dwarf (aka Cull Obsidian) from Infinity War, and the Extremis-powered baddies from Iron Man 3.</p><p dir="ltr">In the comics, It was Dro'ge who came up with this Super-Skrulls formula, though in the books he used the DNA of the members of the Fantastic Four rather than these random other bits. Since the Fantastic Four hasn't actually been introduced yet in the MCU beyond that Reed Richard cameo in the last Doctor Strange movie, that change makes sense.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. FXN News</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4158939-secretinvasionfxnnews.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Christopher McDonald plays a faux-Fox News talking head, though it's not quite 1:1 with the real world. In the show, McDonald's character is opposed to Russia's posturing toward the United States after the Skrull attack, whereas in the real world Fox News leans pro-Russia enough that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/15/technology/russia-media-fox-news.html">Russian state media has used their broadcasts for propaganda purposes</a>. But McDonald's character is a member of the secret Skrull council who at that point was opposed to the war, so at least there's a story reason for it.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. The only reading of human history</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4158938-secretinvasiontheonlyreadingofhumanhistory.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>When Gravik confronts the Skrull council after his big attack, the big debate begins, with Gravik mocking the council members for being so effectively human. "Playing the man's game, using the man's fork and knife," Gravik quipped.</p><p dir="ltr">"Better to behave as a human than as a dog," a councilman replies.</p><p dir="ltr">"I quite like dogs," Gravik declares in response. "In fact, I prefer 'em. Dogs aren't hypocrites. And they don't lie. They don't lock each other up in cages. They don't pimp, poison, and they don't go out of their way to degrade and destroy their own habitat."</p><p dir="ltr">The councilman isn't into this rhetoric: "A naive reading of human history," he said.</p><p dir="ltr">Gravik scoffs.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's the only reading of human history."</p><p dir="ltr">This is a reference to the well documented real-world phenomenon of humans being so awful and uncaring toward each other and the environment that we've ushered in the era of man-made climate change without doing nearly enough to compensate for that change. Thus: <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-the-heat-dome-sizzling-texas-wont-budge/">heat domes</a>. Very topical.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. A new Skrull general</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4158945-secretinvasionbritishpm.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">During this same meeting, the British prime minister--apparently a Skrull who was already secretly aligned with Gravik--makes a proposal: "We need to streamline our chain of command. Democracy is fine for peacetime, but whilst at war, we need a single commander whose war power is total and unchecked. Therefore I nominate Gravik to the post of Skrull General."</p><p dir="ltr">This isn't a concept the PM made up on the spot--in the MCU, this is a thing the Skrulls do, akin to ancient Roman dictators who would be given unlimited power over specific spheres of influence in order to put an end to a crisis situation. But this isn't a thing the Skrulls do in the comics, which makes this a historical Easter egg.</p><p dir="ltr">Interestingly, we learn later in the episode that Talos was the last Skrull general prior to Gravik--he held the post when the Kree destroyed their home.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6. Bring in the superheroes?</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4158952-callinthehulks.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">There have been many instances in standalone Marvel movies and shows where it sure seemed like maybe the heroes could have and should have gotten some help from some of the other random superheroes who we know are around and not busy. But Secret Invasion has given us one of the rare times when the characters in the story actually address that possibility and provide a reason for why they shouldn't call them in.</p><p>Gravik, for his part, straight-up tells the Skrull council that he has a plan ready for if the Avengers make a move. And Fury, for <em>his</em> part, tells Rhodey that if they brought in the big guns, the Skrulls would simply pretend to be them while doing bad things--a scenario that would make everything a lot harder to manage.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7. Alexander Pierce</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4158940-robertredfordalexanderpierce.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>During his meeting with Rhodes, Fury has a fresh dig for former HYDRA/SHIELD boss Alexander Pierce, played by Robert Redford, who was killed during his attempt at global domination in Captain America: The Winter Soldier.</p><p dir="ltr">"Every ounce of power we wrestle from the vice grip of the mediocre Alexander Pierces who run this world was earned in blood," Fury pleads with Rhodes, trying to get his support for this secret war with the Skrulls. Rhodes doesn't buy it though--he fires Fury then and there.</p></h3></p><br />

## Sony Says Current CoD Contract For PlayStation Ends After 2023's Game

<p>According to Sony, 2023's Call of Duty is the last PlayStation entry covered under contract and is the last game in the series guaranteed to come to PlayStation. This comes by way of a court document from the ongoing Microsoft-FTC trial, which evidently wasn't redacted correctly.</p><p>"[T]he last game covered by the contract is a Call of Duty title to be released in late 2023," said PlayStation boss Jim Ryan in a letter obtained by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/28/23777232/sony-says-only-one-more-call-of-duty-game-was-guaranteed-to-come-to-playstation">The Verge</a>.

Alongside releasing Call of Duty games on PlayStation systems, Activision used PlayStation branding in advertisements and gave the PlayStation versions special features.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-says-current-cod-contract-for-playstation-ends-after-2023s-game/1100-6515558/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">A mysterious caller wants to play a game with actor Liam Neeson's character in the official trailer for Retribution, an action film that appears inspired by Speed along with a smidge of Saw. That said, the thriller is a remake of the same-named Spanish movie from 2015.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/retribution-trailer-liam-neeson-bomb-film-remake-1235525450/">The Hollywood Reporter</a> says Neeson stars as Matt Turner, and he's driving with his son and daughter when he receives an unexpected call. The person on the other line informs Turner that a bomb is underneath his seat, and if he leaves the vehicle, it will explode.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">But that's not all, unfortunately. At one point in the Retribution trailer, Turner is also tasked with shooting his apparent best friend or else his own car will be blown up.

Each boss' general location is mentioned on the Hunt Board listing except for the S-Rank targets.

## Squid Game Wasn't The Success For Its Creator You Might Expect

<p> </p><p dir="ltr">Squid Game, the South Korean thriller, has gained worldwide attention on Netflix. However, behind its success lies a troubling tale of the show's creator, Hwang Dong-hyuk, and his lack of fair compensation.

## WoW Classic Hardcore Servers Will Combat Griefing But Leave The Rest Up To Players

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/">World of Warcraft</a> Classic will receive official "Hardcore" servers before the end of the summer, with a public-test-realm build for the permadeath version of the game going live on June 29. Heavily inspired by a popular community game mode with a "death=delete" motto, Blizzard's official version will sport some key differences but will largely leave it up to players to decide how they want to approach the challenge.</p><p dir="ltr">In a group interview with WoW Classic team members Josh Greenfield and Nora Valletta that GameSpot participated in, Blizzard revealed that its official Hardcore servers won't feature many of the restrictions that have come to define the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-classic-hardcore-is-having-a-surge-in-popularity-and-blizzard-may-have-taken-notice/1100-6512413/">Hardcore add-on that fans of permadeath in WoW Classic</a> have operated under up until this point. Gone will be most restrictions on grouping, a ban on using the auction house, asking other players for help, trading items, and the ability to only complete each of the game's dungeons prior to level 60 a single time. Instead, Blizzard is taking a largely hands-off approach when it comes to Hardcore, putting the choice on players as to what further restrictions they would like to make the long and harrowing journey from level 1-60 even more challenging.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">The Spirit Healers are Ready. ⚰️ <br />Official Classic Hardcore is coming.<br />Stay tuned for more info. <a href="https://t.co/tAsmV9NKDI">pic.twitter.com/tAsmV9NKDI</a></p>  — World of Warcraft (@Warcraft) <a href="https://twitter.com/Warcraft/status/1657475304963682306?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">May 13, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">Part of the reason the Hardcore add-on bans using the auction house, trading, and grouping with other players who aren't specific leveling partners is that Hardcore play is currently conducted on servers where some players are playing the game normally. With that in mind, Hardcore players being able to benefit from players who have more than a single life didn't quite seem fair. But with official servers where everyone playing will all be operating under the same single-life ruleset, those restrictions no longer seemed necessary.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-classic-hardcore-servers-will-combat-griefing-but-leave-the-rest-up-to-players/1100-6515547/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

As noted in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-illusion-island-preview-a-mickey-mousetroidvania/1100-6515280/">preview,</a> Disney Illusion Island is a metroidvania that will have you running, jumping, swinging, and solving a variety of puzzles as Mickey, Minnie, Donald, and Goofy.</p><p>If you want to tackle the action solo, you’ll be glad to know the entire game is beatable without the help of any companions. However, based on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiUG1YWiMIY">latest trailer</a> for Illusion Island, it looks like having a few pals around for the adventure is the ideal way to play. There’s also no traditional combat to be found, though you will have to overcome a variety of challenging boss battles and make use of unique skills like Rope Drop and Leap Frog.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-to-preorder-disney-illusion-island-for-nintendo-switch/1100-6515544/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Red Dead Redemption Might Be Getting A Re-Release

<p>Rockstar's Red Dead Redemption could be getting a re-release, if a new age rating online is any indication.</p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2023/06/red-dead-redemption-rated-in-korea-in-2023">Gematsu</a>, the Game Rating and Administration of Korea published a new rating for Red Dead Redemption on June 15. The rating is classified with the number CC-NV-230615-001, in which the "NV" bit refers to console games. This might mean that Rockstar has plans for Red Dead Redemption, such as creating remasters for current consoles.</p><p>Red Dead Redemption was first released in 2010 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. It was never ported to PC or any other consoles, including PS4, PS5, Xbox One, or Xbox Series X|S. Even though the Korean rating only notes console games, that doesn't mean a PC version is out of the question either.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-might-be-getting-a-re-release/1100-6515543/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## PlayStation Plus Free Games For July 2023 Leaked

<p>As usual, the next PlayStation Plus free games lineup has <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/bons-plans/ps-essential-et-jeux-juillet-2023-call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war-alan-wake-remastered-et-endling-extinction-is-forever-sur-ps5ps4-2575371">leaked</a> early. These leaks have never been wrong, so it's close to a guarantee that PlayStation will announce the same trio of games later today. With that said, the PS Plus Essential lineup for July 2023 is shaping up to be quite impressive: Alan Wake Remastered, Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, and Endling - Extinction is Forever.</p><p><strong>Alan Wake Remastered</strong> is particularly timely, as Alan Wake II is set to launch October 17 for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. If you've never played the original game, the 2021 remaster is definitely worth checking out. The action-adventure follows the eponymous thriller novelist's search for his missing wife while on vacation in a curious little town. Though the original game only dabbles with horror, the sequel looks like a straight-up horror game. Both the PS5 and PS4 versions of Alan Wake Remastered will be up for grabs.</p><p>PS Plus subscribers will also be able to check out <strong>Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War</strong>, the 2020 entry in the first-person shooter franchise. Cold War is the latest iteration of the Black Ops sub-series from Treyarch and Raven Software. Its campaign is (unsurprisingly) set during the 1980s, and it has a full online multiplayer suite as well as Zombies mode. The freebie will be the Cross-Gen bundle, which means the PS5 and PS4 versions are included.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-free-games-july-2023/1100-6515538/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Even though the company made an effort to fight back against cheaters, Yager admits that many users had already been impacted, resulting in "a significant decrease in" the player base.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dev-shuts-down-pvp-shooter-says-cheaters-are-to-blame/1100-6515539/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>In 2019, All Elite Wrestling opened its doors and immediately changed the professional wrestling world. For the first time in a long while, a promotion emerged which could rival the longtime king of American pro wrestling, WWE. There have undeniably been some growing pains, but four years later, AEW continues to be a popular alternative option for wrestling fans. Now, the company is trying to do the same in the video game world with AEW: Fight Forever, and much like those first AEW shows, the game is a promising debut effort--but with some noticeable room for improvement.</p><p dir="ltr">Fight Forever features 47 wrestlers--a far cry from the 218 wrestlers in WWE 2K23, for comparison--at the start, with more able to be unlocked via the in-game shop with currency earned through playing the game. AEW mainstays like MJF, Kenny Omega, Jon Moxley, Dr. Britt Baker D.M.D., "Hangman" Adam Page, and The Young Bucks are here, as well as a few surprising entries. Some of them are heartwarming tributes to wrestlers who have passed away--like Mr. Brodie Lee and Owen Hart--while others are names who have departed to the competition like Cody Rhodes. There are plenty of names missing--the current AEW Women's Champion Toni Storm, the previous women's champion Jamie Hayter, and two-thirds of the Trios Champion House Of Black, for example--but it does represent most of the top talent currently in the promotion.</p><figure style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4158403-2.jpg"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4158403-2.jpg" /></a></figure><p dir="ltr">What's cool about Fight Forever's approach to the roster is that everyone is on an even playing field. There are no ratings in Fight Forever; I can pick any matchup I want and have the same chance of winning no matter who I'm controlling. And I do mean "any matchup I want," as intergender matches--which aren't available in WWE's current game series--are completely fine here. The game treats its roster less like a wrestling simulation, with clear divisions and ratings that separate the big stars from the midcard talent, and more like a fighting game where anyone can fight anyone, no questions asked. Being able to book whoever I want in a match, regardless of gender, size, or any other factors, is a really cool approach and I love that Fight Forever opted for it.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/aew-fight-forever-review-a-midcard-debut/1900-6418082/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-go/">Pokemon Go</a>'s latest update 0.275.0 had players excited after they discovered it doubled the range at which catchable Pokemon appear on the map from 40m to 80m. Despite initial reports suggesting the change was intentional, Niantic has now said that the improvement was a bug that will be reversed.</p><p>Because the update notes were so vague, listing it only as "quality-of-life updates; minor bug fixes and performance improvements," players initially weren't sure if the update was working as intended. A number of reports from Pokemon content creators initially seemed to confirm that the radius increase was in fact intentional, with <a href="https://pokemongohub.net/post/news/new-update-version-0-275-0-doubles-spawn-radius/">Pokemon Go Hub</a> explaining "we were told this was not a bug." Now-deleted tweets cited by <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-june-content-update-spawn-radius-niantic-1850581024">Kotaku</a> also show confirmation from inside sources that the update was working as intended.</p><p>After players started to celebrate the update as one of the best for quality of life in Pokemon Go's recent history, showing off some densely-populated <a href="https://twitter.com/mrblake29/status/1673617091927351297">Spotlight Hour screenshots</a>, Niantic has now said that the spawn radius increase was in fact a bug.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/niantic-to-reverse-popular-pokemon-go-update-that-increased-spawn-radius/1100-6515535/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## League Of Legends Introduces 2v2 Arena Mode For Soul Fighter Summer Event

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/league-of-legends/">League of Legends</a> has introduced a new Arena mode as part of its Soul Fighter summer event, pitting four teams of two players against each other in a big shakeup to the game's usual 5v5 Summoner's Rift matches.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/dev-arena/">blog post</a> about the new mode, design lead Daniel "Riot Maxw3ll" Emmons described Arena as "a mashup of League and Teamfight Tactics, focused squarely on putting you into the action faster, forcing you to respond to huge power ups, and tempting you to try truly wacky nonsense."</p><p>Players can queue solo or with a friend to enter the arena in a team of two. Each match has multiple rounds, and each round has a buy phase and a combat phase, where you'll face off against another team 2v2. Match ups will rotate between the four teams in the arena, with each having a team health bar that goes down with each loss. If you're eliminated, you'll be able to exit early and queue for a new game immediately.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/league-of-legends-introduces-2v2-arena-mode-for-soul-fighter-summer-event/1100-6515534/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
