As Nvidia fills out its 40 series product stack, we’ve noticed one clear trend. DLSS and Frame-Gen are IN, and decent value, is out. This was apparent on the RTX 4060 Ti, and the RTX 4070. But does the song remain the same on the $299 RTX 4060? And will it be able to compete with AMD’s budget offerings of the RX 7600 and RX 6700XT? Will Intel Arc GPUs show up finally? Got to watch our latest LTT Labs-backed GPU review.
