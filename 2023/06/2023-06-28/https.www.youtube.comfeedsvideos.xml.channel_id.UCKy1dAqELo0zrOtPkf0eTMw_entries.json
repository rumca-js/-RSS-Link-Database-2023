Dante is everything Ari isn't, and his wanderlust for life and artistic spirit shake\u00a0something loose in Ari; finally, he has a friend.\u00a0A near-magical being, Dante disrupts Aristotle\u2019s world, introducing him to music, poetry, and lessons about the sky. Dante gives Aristotle\u00a0permission to live in an ever-expansive universe, making it harder and harder for him to maintain the fa\u00e7ade of isolation that has protected him for so long.\u00a0Their summer of adventure comes to an abrupt halt when the boys are torn apart. Armed with a new perspective, Aristotle uses Dante\u2019s absence to understand who he wants to be in the world. Ari must decide if he is going to live in the world of infinite possibilities that Dante represents. At first, fear holds Aristotle hostage and he retreats into his lonely existence. But Ari soon realizes he can\u2019t unsee the world through Dante\u2019s eyes. If only he would let go of the secrets he didn\u2019t even know he was keeping and embrace the wonders of the universe.\n\n#IGN", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPOUuCLls9w", "date_published": "2023-06-28 22:00:36+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Annapurna Interactive Showcase I Summer of Gaming 2023", "description": "Tune in on June 29 at Noon PT / 3 pm ET for Annapurna's latest showcase!

So much of it feels like a very good start, going full gear with bouncy animations, the quick pace of the action, and fun and effective character design. But almost all of its good ideas are hampered by bugs and opaque or outright useless systems. Its big single-player mode is poorly written and, though it's a relative breeze to complete and full of branching options, it\u2019s all out of good ways to point you to them. There\u2019s a strong foundation to bet double or nothing on in a sequel down the road, and I think there's still fun to be had here with like-minded friends who are content with casually beating each other up, but this is no wrestling game revolution.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #Wrestling", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPKGIzP_Bh0", "date_published": "2023-06-28 16:00:38+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Retribution - Official Trailer (2023) Liam Neeson, Noma Dumezweni, Matthew Modine", "description": "Watch the Retribution trailer for the upcoming thriller movie starring Liam Neeson, Noma Dumezweni, Lilly Aspell, Jack Champion, Embeth Davidtz, and Matthew Modine.

Also available on Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5.\n\n\"Park Beyond does a great job tapping into the childhood whimsy that theme parks can elicit. There's a great sense of wonder to be had by impossifying rides, and the simple interface makes it easy to do. Incrementally unlocking new rides and increasing park capacity is rewarding, and creating something utterly ludicrous can be a blast. But that joy dissipates quickly when parks become unmanageable, as the attendees get stuck, staff ignores pressing needs, and financial ruin springs seemingly out of nowhere, while bugs and crashes make a late-campaign difficulty spike a miserable slog. Like riding an unfinished roller coaster, there\u2019s fun to be had until the eventual crash, but it feels like this park just isn\u2019t ready to be opened.\"", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDdheNv9DUM", "date_published": "2023-06-28 13:00:13+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Project Loki - Official Announcement", "description": "Theorycraft Games is a brand-new development team comprised of developers that have worked on major games like League of Legends, Valorant, Overwatch, Halo, Destiny, and Apex Legends.
