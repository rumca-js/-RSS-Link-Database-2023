This is the first episode of a new series we’re calling Eyes Only - where we use leaked and declassified documents to understand what’s really happening behind the scenes.

Answering questions like: How do politicians wield their influence? What can these documents teach us about their decisions and motivations?  And what do the powerful say to each other when they think nobody is listening?

In this episode, we explore an insane plan to conduct false flag attacks against American targets, perpetrated by the US military. Before the Cuban Missile Crisis, the US came dangerously close to going to war with Cuba. The US military was intent on invading the island and removing Fidel Castro from power, and their plan to do it was called Operation Northwoods.
