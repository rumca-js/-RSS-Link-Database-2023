<p>Researchers at the University of Maryland have turned eye reflections into (somewhat discernible) 3D scenes. The work builds on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), an AI technology that can <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-instant-nerf-artificial-intelligence-130015116.html">reconstruct environments from 2D photos</a>. Although the eye-reflection approach has a long way to go before it spawns any practical applications, the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.09348.pdf">study</a> (first <a href="https://techxplore.com/news/2023-06-three-dimensional-images-eye-nerf.html">reported by</a><em>Tech Xplore</em>) provides a fascinating glimpse into a technology that could eventually reveal an environment from a series of simple portrait photos.</p><p>The team used subtle reflections of light captured in human eyes (using consecutive images shot from a single sensor) to try to discern the person’s immediate environment. They began with several high-resolution images from a fixed camera position, capturing a moving individual looking toward the camera. They then zoomed in on the reflections, isolating them and calculating where the eyes were looking in the photos.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The results (here’s the <a href="https://world-from-eyes.github.io/">entire set animated</a>) show a decently discernible environmental reconstruction from human eyes in a controlled setting. A scene captured using a synthetic eye (below) produced a more impressive dreamlike scene. However, an attempt to model eye reflections from Miley Cyrus and Lady Gaga music videos only produced vague blobs that the researchers could only guess were an LED grid and a camera on a tripod — illustrating how far the tech is from real-world use.</p><figure><img alt="A dream-like scene of a room with a wall covered with various hanging frames. A broom leans against the wall, and two shirts hang nearby. A dresser sits farther to the left. We see the wall at a slight angle." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/0f92c550-15f2-11ee-b37b-41001507bd4d" style="height: 1080px; width: 1800px;" /><figcaption>Reconstructions using a synthetic eye were much more vivid and lifelike — with a dreamlike quality.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">University of Maryland</div></figure><p>The team overcame significant obstacles to reconstruct even crude and fuzzy scenes. For example, the cornea introduces “inherent noise” that makes it difficult to separate the reflected light from humans’ complex iris textures. To address that, they introduced cornea pose optimization (estimating the position and orientation of the cornea) and iris texture decomposition (extracting features unique to an individual’s iris) during training. Finally, radial texture regularization loss (a machine-learning technique that simulates smoother textures than the source material) helped further isolate and enhance the reflected scenery.</p><p>Despite the progress and clever workarounds, significant barriers remain. “Our current real-world results are from a ‘laboratory setup,’ such as a zoom-in capture of a person’s face, area lights to illuminate the scene, and deliberate person’s movement,” the authors wrote. “We believe more unconstrained settings remain challenging (e.g., video conferencing with natural head movement) due to lower sensor resolution, dynamic range, and motion blur.” Additionally, the team notes that its universal assumptions about iris texture may be too simplistic to apply broadly, especially when eyes typically rotate more widely than in this kind of controlled setting.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, the team sees their progress as a milestone that can spur future breakthroughs. “With this work, we hope to inspire future explorations that leverage unexpected, accidental visual signals to reveal information about the world around us, broadening the horizons of 3D scene reconstruction.” Although more mature versions of this work could spawn some creepy and unwanted privacy intrusions, at least you can rest easy knowing that today’s version can only vaguely make out a Kirby doll even under the most ideal of conditions.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/researchers-reconstruct-3d-environments-from-eye-reflections-203949099.html?src=rss

## Women’s soccer teams are coming to Football Manager in 2024

<p>Sports Interactive said back in 2021 that it would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/football-manager-womens-soccer-145306757.html"><ins>bring women's soccer to Football Manager</ins></a>, its long-running simulation franchise. Now, we have a clearer idea of when that will happen. In <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/future-football-manager"><ins>a blog post</ins></a> that looks at the franchise's future, SI says it will introduce women's teams in <em>Football Manager 2025</em>, which is next year's edition.</p><p>The studio initially said it would take a while to bring women's soccer into the fold as it wanted to offer the same level of depth that it does for the men's game. Football Manager has an enormous database of tens of thousands of players, each with individual stats, bios, injury history and so on. Not only that, SI had to account for changes to the attribute systems, gender considerations for translations and different league rules when it comes to women's football.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;The facts are that we’ve made really good progress in many areas, including research, the match engine and translation,&quot; SI studio manager Miles Jacobson wrote. &quot;But there are other areas that haven’t made enough advancements, a lot of which are legal issues. The women's game deserves to be the best it possibly can be when it is released.&quot;</p><p>Alongside the addition of women's teams, <em>Football Manager 2025 </em>will herald a fundamental shift for the series as SI is moving to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/unity/"><ins>Unity</ins></a> game engine. Jacobson says this will &quot;give us a lot more power graphically, across all formats, alongside powerful user interface tools.&quot; There will be an entirely new UI and &quot;a significantly better looking matchday experience,&quot; while animations are making &quot;a big jump&quot; forward. It'll take a little longer to transition to Unity on mobile, however.</p><p>A project to overhaul the underlying tech of Football Manager has been in the works for several years. The initial aim was to revamp the series with <em>Football Manager 2022</em>, but the COVID-19 pandemic forced SI to take a step back and focus on making sure it could release a new version each year.</p><p>Elsewhere, Jacobson acknowledged that while <em>FM23</em> has reached more than 5 million players (by far the most in the series' history after SI introduced Apple Arcade and PS5 versions), some of its features weren't up to scratch. Some of those who play each year's edition may have also been disappointed by having &quot;fewer new features than normal,&quot; the studio head noted.</p><p>However, SI has expanded its team and it's on track to fully implement <em>FM24</em>'s new features faster than usual, leaving more time for polish and bug fixes. One of those updates is well overdue: the option to transfer your progress from <em>FM23</em> and continue where you left off while benefiting from <em>FM24</em>'s upgrades. Even though SI will move to a new game engine next year, the studio plans to let players take their <em>FM24 </em>saves into <em>FM25 </em>as well.</p><p>&quot;This is especially good for those playing via <a href="https://www.engadget.com/football-manager-2022-xbox-game-pass-november-9-155346252.html"><ins>Game Pass</ins></a> and Apple Arcade who, by subscribing to those platforms, would lose access to their career shortly after the new game is released,&quot; Jacobson wrote. &quot;This has been unavoidable to date due to the expiry of our licenses which require us to remove titles from platforms upon conclusion. We’re still working out the finer details with the platform holders, but the idea is that you’ll be able to seamlessly move from <em>FM23 </em>to <em>FM24 </em>on those platforms and continue your save or start a new one.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/womens-soccer-teams-are-coming-to-football-manager-in-2024-195653376.html?src=rss

## 'World of Warcraft Classic Hardcore' brings permadeath to Blizzard's MMO

<p>Blizzard is <a href="https://t.co/g0CAonPrTF">bringing hardcore servers</a> to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/world-of-warcraft-classic-wrath-of-the-lich-king-classic-september-26-release-date-204826616.html"><em>World of Warcraft Classic</em></a>. Inspired by the game’s popular <a href="https://classichardcore.com/"><ins>“Death = Delete” community add-on</ins></a>, the mode limits any character you create to exactly one life. If your hero dies, running back to their body as a ghost won’t bring them back to life, nor can someone else resurrect your character with a class ability like the Shaman’s Ancestral Spirit spell. You also can’t use abilities like the Warlock’s Soulstone spell to bring your character back to life on their own. Oh, and Paladins won’t be able to bubble hearth out of sticky situations.</p><div id="b7bc98c47bf14279850a8eb1e81f9650"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Hardcore realms are coming to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WoWClassic?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WoWClassic</a>! <br /><br />Here’s everything you need to know 👇 <br /><br />☠️ <a href="https://t.co/g0CAonPrTF">https://t.co/g0CAonPrTF</a><a href="https://t.co/zknkUVZ2Ai">pic.twitter.com/zknkUVZ2Ai</a></p>— World of Warcraft (@Warcraft) <a href="https://twitter.com/Warcraft/status/1674100846030618631?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 28, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>Your character won’t disappear after they die. Instead, they will remain as a ghost, so you can stay in touch with guildmates and any friends you met during your adventure. And if you want to continue playing your character after their untimely demise, Blizzard will offer free transfers to non-hardcore servers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This being <em>World of Warcraft</em> we’re talking about, you have to imagine some people will try to trick other players into killing their own characters. To that point, Blizzard says <em>Classic Hardcore </em>will feature restrictions not found in other versions of the game. For instance, you won’t be able to kite a monster from one area to another in hopes of it terrorizing low-level characters. You also will need to deliberately flag yourself for PvP combat before you can attack another player. “We’ve added this failsafe to prevent situations in which a player could unintentionally take aggressive action against another player who is flagged for PvP, and unwittingly flag themselves,” notes Blizzard.</p><p>Speaking of PvP, <em>Classic Hardcore </em>will feature less of an emphasis on player-versus-player combat. You can’t queue for battlegrounds, for example, but Blizzard is introducing a new dueling mechanic that allows players to challenge one another to a fight to the death. Slaying an opposing player in such a duel will impart a permanent cosmetic buff called “String of Ears” on your character that tracks the number of players you’ve successfully taken down.</p><p>Hardcore servers will arrive in <em>World of Warcraft Classic</em> before the end of summer. Before then, a public test build of the new mode will go live on June 29th.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/world-of-warcraft-classic-hardcore-brings-permadeath-to-blizzards-mmo-192837221.html?src=rss

<p>The Nintendo Switch Online <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1673859606429278209"><ins>library just got a bit beefier,</ins></a> thanks to the addition of four classic Sega Genesis titles. The subscription-based classic games platform is now host to <em>Ghouls ‘n Ghosts, The Revenge of Shinobi, Landstalker</em> and <em>Crusader of Centy</em>, joining around 30 pre-existing Genesis titles and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-12-nintendo-snes-nes-games-switch-online.html"><ins>many more NES, SNES and Game Boy releases.</ins></a> That’s right. Sonic and Mario are friends now.</p><p>For the uninitiated, <em>Ghouls ‘n Ghosts</em> is a tough-as-nails platformer that still gives nightmares to adults of a certain age. <em>The Rise of Shinobi</em> is a serviceable entry in the OG ninja-simulation franchise. <em>Landstalker</em> is a cult favorite action RPG with an isometric view and <em>Crusader of Centy</em> is a well-reviewed, yet relatively obscure, Zelda clone. <em>Crusader of Centy</em> is tough to find, with physical copies selling for thousands of dollars, so this is a boon for retro gaming enthusiasts. Here’s a video of all four games in action, so you can decide if you want to plunk down $50 for a yearly NSO Expansion Pack subscription.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="6c8d2597bce74557a9d1b1d8e0b0d865"></div><p>As a note, these games are only available with a $50-yearly Expansion Pack subscription, though that also gets you access to N64 and Game Boy Advance titles. If you just want to play from a library of NES, SNES and Game Boy releases, go with the cheaper standard NSO subscription of $20 each year. Nintendo isn’t exactly speedy with these releases, with game drops around once a month, so <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nintendo_Switch_Online_games"><ins>check the full library</ins></a> before handing over your debit card information.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-online-gets-four-classic-genesis-games-including-ghouls-n-ghosts-184550953.html?src=rss

<p>Sony <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/06/28/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-july-call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war-alan-wake-remastered-endling-extinction-is-forever/">announced</a> the PlayStation Plus games lineup for July today. They include <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War</em>, <em>Alan Wake Remastered</em> and <em>Endling – Extinction is Forever</em>. All three titles will be available on PS5 and PS4 for subscribers on the Essential, Extra and Premium tiers.</p><p><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War</em> (2020) is a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/call-duty-black-ops-cold-war-release-date-campaign-details-preview-174511823.html">controversial installment</a> in the long-running military shooter franchise. Set in the early 1980s, its plot borrows from a well-known (and largely baseless) real-world conspiracy theory about a Soviet spy named Perseus who supposedly infiltrated the US atomic weapons program. If you can get past its questionable premise and (arguably tone-deaf) Vietnam War flashback missions, you can enjoy classic Call of Duty shoot-em-up fare as you blast your way across East Berlin, Turkey, Moscow and other Cold War hotspots. In addition to the story mission, it includes the title’s Multiplayer and Zombies modes.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Promotional still from &#x002018;Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War,&#x002019; featuring a Soviet leader with a scarred face walking through a dark and ominous environment." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/6535a990-15df-11ee-8cff-f72039781e14" style="height: 2160px; width: 3840px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Activision</div></figure><p>Meanwhile, <em>Alan Wake Remastered</em> is the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/alan-wake-4k-remaster-release-date-remedy-epic-games-store-xbox-playstation-130059237.html">2021 remake</a> of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-05-05-review-alan-wake.html">now 13-year-old</a> adventure title that was initially an Xbox 360 exclusive. The game puts you in the shoes of the title character, a successful author on vacation in the (fictional) Washington state town of Bright Falls. But after his wife mysteriously vanishes, he sets out on a nightmarish investigation that blurs the lines between reality and fiction. The remastered version includes the case game and (initially DLC) expansions “The Signal” and “The Writer.”</p><p>Finally, <em>Endling – Extinction is Forever</em> is a third-person survival-adventure title that puts you in the paws of the last surviving fox. Set in a future reality where humans have exhausted Earth’s resources, leaving it in ruin, you must guide your three cubs to safety and save the species. Aside from its obvious thematic commentary about climate change, nature preservation and human excess, it provides fun (and relatively short) stealth gameplay using 2D movement in shifting 3D environments.</p><figure><img alt="Gameplay still from &#x002018;Endling &#x002013; Extinction is Forever,&#x002019; displaying a mother fox and her three cubs journeying through a dark forest at night." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/d554aa50-15df-11ee-bfb7-591cacb918b0" style="height: 1740px; width: 2900px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Herobeat Studios</div></figure><p>The three games will be available for PlayStation Plus subscribers from July 4th through the 31st.

<p>Film director Roland Emmerich is <a href="https://spacenation.online/whitepaper/"><ins>making a massively-multiplayer online (MMO) game</ins></a> powered by everyone’s favorite punching bags, NFTs. The director of <em>Independence Day, Stargate</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/moonfall-roland-emmerich-teaser-trailer-174550646.html"><ins>and, uh, </ins><em><ins>Moonfall</ins></em></a> just announced <em>Space Nation Online,</em> a forthcoming RPG that's going to be part of a larger shared universe encompassing animated shorts, a live-action TV show and plenty of Web3 nonsense.</p><p>To that end, there’s a bile-inducing page <a href="https://spacenation.online/whitepaper/tokenomics/framework"><ins>detailing the tokenomics</ins></a> surrounding the “Web3 Space Opera MMO”, if you want to throw away your money on a procedurally-generated picture of a starship or whatever.

Despite the heavy emphasis on non-fungible tokens, there’s some decent talent behind the scenes here, beyond Emmerich.

<p>It’s Wednesday, which means it’s the perfect time to waste away a few minutes attempting to solve the internet’s latest obsession. If you’re on Twitter, you may have noticed some chatter about <a href="https://neal.fun/password-game/"><em>The Password Game</em></a>, a browser experience that will test your creativity, patience and sanity.</p><div id="10d9ab739c8048fab7d1a3efb56e7972"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">The password game is out now!

Then, things start to become progressively more unhinged. Rule seven demands you include a Roman numeral, only for rule nine to then tell that you need a handful of Roman numerals that equal 35 when multiplied. Eventually, your password will also need to reference today’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/wordle-party-game-board-game-hasbro-preorder-215501443.html">Wordle</a> and the current phase of the moon written as an emoji.

Agarwal’s Twitter mentions are full of people cursing him for creating such a devious challenge. Some, however, have managed to get to the end. “I can’t believe people are actually beating the Password Game,” Agarwal wrote on Wednesday. “The human spirit is strong.” As for me, I’m scrubbing it out here at rule 15, trying to avoid doing some tricky math. But I promise you, I will succeed, even if it kills me or that damn caterpillar.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/i-consider-myself-a-patient-person-but-the-password-game-might-break-me-174555782.html?src=rss

## North America’s first hydrogen-powered train debuts in Canada

<p>This summer, North America’s first hydrogen-powered train began <a href="https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2023/6/first-americas-alstoms-hydrogen-train-enters-revenue-service-charlevoix-quebec">traveling</a> across the Canadian countryside. The French passenger train is a short-term demonstration, running through the end of September, that aims to spark adoption in Canada and the US. “I think the most important thing that’s going to come out of it is people’s awareness and comfort with the technology,” Robert Stasko, executive director of Ontario’s Hydrogen Business Council, <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/hydrogen-train-quebec-city-1.6888891">told</a><em>CBC News</em>.</p><p>The Canadian loaner runs from Montmorency Falls in Quebec City to Base-Saint-Paul — a two-and-a-half hour trip — on Wednesdays to Sundays through September 30th. The train has a top speed of 140 km/h (87 mph) and can carry up to 120 people in its two passenger cars. The French company Alstom, which makes the train, says its acceleration and braking performance is comparable to standard diesel-engine trains — sans the emissions. While much of Europe uses trains with electric rails or overhead wires, hydrogen trains are ideal for places like the Canadian countryside, with its long distances and relatively low commuter density. (Much of the US would fit that bill as well.)</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The same model of train, the Coradia iLint, has already made runs in eight European countries. As many as 14 of the same model began <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-first-hydrogen-powered-train-line-is-now-in-service-142028596.html">running a route</a> in Lower Saxony, Germany, last year. Alstom began <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-25-hydrogen-train-of-the-future.html">testing the trains in 2018</a> and has additional contracts in Germany, Italy and France. The company says European clients have ordered 41 of the trainsets.</p><p>The Coradia iLint uses a ballpark of “about 50 kilograms of hydrogen a day,” says Serge Harnois, CEO of Hanois Énergies, the train’s hydrogen fuel supplier. The same journey using a standard engine would burn around 500 liters of diesel fuel. It only emits water vapor along its journey as a byproduct of combining hydrogen with oxygen in a fuel cell to generate its power.</p><p>There are some asterisks to attach to the three-month demo. First, it requires a diesel-powered truck to transport the hydrogen to the train every time it refuels. (Harnois says that, ideally, the hydrogen would eventually be produced onsite to avoid this step.) We also have to wonder about the emissions produced on its presumed voyage from Europe to Canada for its mere three-month demo. However, the train will move on to other North American cities after its summer residence. The long-term goal is for the tour to help promote widespread hydrogen-train adoption across different North American regions, which — if successful — could more than offset the carbon footprint from its diesel-truck top-offs and journey across the Atlantic.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/north-americas-first-hydrogen-powered-train-debuts-in-canada-173019365.html?src=rss

<p>Your local store might only need a smartphone to accept your payments. PayPal is <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2023-06-28-Introducing-Tap-to-Pay-for-Venmo-and-PayPal-Zettle-Businesses-in-the-U-S">rolling out</a> tap to pay on Android for Venmo and Zettle businesses in the US. Shops can accept Apple Pay, Google Pay and other contactless services or cards, including digital wallets, without requiring a card reader. You might not have to bring out your wallet, in other words. Setup takes just minutes, PayPal claims.</p><p>Initial setup is free. Tap to pay will roll out to all Venmo businesses in the country over the &quot;coming months,&quot; PayPal says, but would-be clients can sign up for early access now. The approach is already available for all PayPal Zettle users in the US. The company adds that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/paypal-venmo-support-tap-to-pay-iphone-092025702.html">Tap to Pay on iPhone</a> is now available for some American users, and should reach all of them &quot;soon.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The incentive for PayPal is clear. <em>TechCrunch</em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/28/paypal-launches-support-for-tap-to-pay-on-android-for-merchants-using-venmo-and-zettle-in-the-u-s/">notes</a> Venmo and Zettle take 2.29 percent plus nine cents for every transaction. If a store relies on either brand's tap to pay for many of their sales, they stand to profit even if the customers themselves never use those services. You can already use Venmo as a customer in major stores <a href="https://www.engadget.com/starbucks-venmo-payments-204354442.html">like Starbucks</a> — this theoretically gives PayPal more of a stake in the entire retail process.</p><p>As with Square, Apple's Tap to Pay on iPhone and similar offerings, PayPal's approach potentially makes contactless payment more accessible. It lowers the costs of entry, and lets small businesses take your preferred payment method wherever they happen to be, such as outdoors or at a convention. That, in turn, could reduce the need for cash and conventional credit or debit cards. It's just a question of whether or not the tech and its costs gain enough traction among retailers.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/venmo-now-supports-tap-to-pay-on-android-phones-164527267.html?src=rss

<p>If <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vizio-m-series-quantum-x-tvs-elevate-soundbar-100052598.html">Vizio's</a> TV interface has felt stale as of late, don't worry — it's getting a makeover. The company is rolling out a redesigned home screen that it hopes will make it easier to find content. The revamp is meant to be more intuitive, with new navigation features, menus and settings. There's also a reworked on-screen keyboard to help you search faster.</p><p>Discovery is likewise a major focus. The updated home screen incudes recommendations as well as parental guidance and Rotten Tomatoes scores. Genre pages help you dig into a given category faster. There's more customization, too, with a personalized &quot;app row&quot; that lets you flag favorites with one remote click. You'll get recommendations on a per-app basis, and a My Watchlist section pools together movies and shows from multiple apps.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Vizio hasn't detailed just which TV models are receiving the new home screen, or when the rollout will be complete. We've asked the company for more details. There's no guarantee older sets will get the upgrade, then, but you won't necessarily need to buy new hardware.</p><p>Interface updates aren't new to TVs, but there is a tendency in the industry to limit major revamps to new or very recent TV sets. LG didn't bring 2018's webOS 4 to webOS 3 TVs released just a year earlier, for example. If Vizio delivers the new home screen to more than its latest sets, it's providing better aftermarket support than some of its larger competitors.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/vizios-redesigned-tv-interface-helps-you-quickly-find-shows-170037252.html?src=rss

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google/"><ins>Google</ins></a> has denied "extremely inaccurate claims" that it may have violated its own rules and misled advertisers over ad viewership on third-party websites.&nbsp;</p><p>Through the Google Video Partners network and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-13-youtube-stops-counting-ads-toward-music-charts.html"><ins>TrueView</ins></a> (an ad product that's also used on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/youtube/"><ins>YouTube</ins></a>), the company handles placement of video ads on external websites and apps. According to <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2f007401-3eaa-4237-b69b-54ccbe125502&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Wall+Street+Journal&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyZjAwNzQwMS0zZWFhLTQyMzctYjY5Yi01NGNjYmUxMjU1MDIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9nb29nbGUtdmlvbGF0ZWQtaXRzLXN0YW5kYXJkcy1pbi1hZC1kZWFscy1yZXNlYXJjaC1maW5kcy0zZTI0ZTA0MSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZThlOWY2MWYtODY3Ni00MWQ2LWI1ZmMtYzAyMWZiZWU5YWU4In0&amp;signature=AQAAAZwK0IER0JZx_GmNwESE0RX0ixBlADEGM_e-xZHt1Mz0&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Fgoogle-violated-its-standards-in-ad-deals-research-finds-3e24e041"><em><ins>The Wall Street Journal</ins></em></a>, Google tells brands that their ads will be on "high-quality" sites, appear before the main content of a video and run with audio on. It also says that advertisers won't pay if users skip the ads. However, a third-party analytics company suggested in a report that Google fails to live up to these standards around 80 percent of the time.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Adalytics said the ads often appear on lower-quality websites, such as those with misinformation or pirated content, and that they can be positioned in small video players on the side or bottom of the screen, away from the main "in-stream" content. Some of the ads run without any audio, <a href="https://adalytics.io/blog/invalid-google-video-partner-trueview-ads"><ins>according to the report,</ins></a> while in other cases, there were was "little to no video content in between consecutive TrueView ads." Adalytics says other ads autoplayed without the viewer engaging with them.</p><p>In some instances, the company notes, the skip button that typically appears after five seconds was obscured, forcing viewers to watch the whole ad. That's "a direct violation of Google’s quality standards for TrueView ads," Adalytics says, and it may have contributed to artificially inflated ad metrics, leading to advertisers paying more.</p><p>Adalytics reviewed ad campaigns for more than 1,100 brands between 2020 and this year. It says customers that might have bought "muted, auto-playing, mis-declared TrueView skippable in-stream inventory include" the US government, the European Parliament, Disney+, HP, Samsung, Sephora, TikTok, Microsoft and General Motors. As it happens, some other Google divisions (Google Career Certificates and Google Workspace Domains) are on the list.</p><p>Media buyers Adalytics shared the report with accused Google of conducting "ad fraud" and suggested brands weren't getting what they paid for. Others have demanded a refund. The "misalignment" could have cost brands billions in advertising dollars, Adalytics said. One "major consumer goods brand" found that 20 percent of a $75,000-plus campaign budget was directed toward YouTube channels, with the remainder spent on ads that ran on third-party destinations such as investing.com and <em>Candy Crush Saga.</em></p><p>Google has firmly rejected the report's findings. The company's global video solutions chief, Marvin Renaud, asserted <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/transparency-and-brand-safety-on-google-video-partners/"><ins>in a blog post</ins></a> that Adalytics "used unreliable sampling and proxy methodologies." An "overwhelming majority of video ad campaigns" run on YouTube, Renaud claimed, with brands having the option to opt out at any time from running their ads on Google Video Partners-affiliated apps and websites.</p><p>Even so, over 90 percent of Google Video Partners "are visible to people across the web," Renaud argued. "We use real-time ad quality signals to determine if people are present and paying attention that help us decide whether to serve a video ad in a Google Video Partner site or app."</p><p>In addition, Renaud wrote, Google rigorously enforces policies that prohibit third-party sites from using deceptive or disruptive techniques to generate advertising revenue, such as placing ads in hidden browser windows. Renaud added that, last year, Google stopped running ads on more than 143,000 websites it deemed to violate its rules.</p><p>The Adalytics claims come as Alphabet faces close scrutiny over its advertising practices.

## Bloober Team is done making psychological horror games

<p><em>Layers of Fear</em> was Bloober Team’s final psychological horror game. The studio didn’t advertise this fact, but behind the scenes, a switch flipped weeks ago: When the remastered and expanded <em>Layers of Fear</em> collection came out on June 15th, it marked the end of a phase that was known internally as Bloober Team 2.0.</p><p>“This year is like closing the era of making psychological horror games,” studio co-founder Piotr Babieno told Engadget. “Right now we are going into Bloober Team 3.0, making mass-market horror.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Bloober is not abandoning horror as a whole, but it is shifting focus. Over the past decade, the studio cemented itself as a powerhouse in the realm of psychological horror games, releasing the Layers of Fear franchise, <em>Observer</em>, <em>Blair Witch</em> and<em> The Medium</em>, all of which generated terror through narrative and environmental cues (otherwise known as “vibes”). Because of these design choices, Bloober games have jokingly been called “walking simulators,” a description that Babieno didn’t deny.</p><p>“We focused on the story, we focused on the mood, we focused on the quality of graphics and music, but we didn’t put a lot of attention on the gameplay mechanics,” Babieno said. “It wasn’t our target. But we decided that there was a ceiling that we couldn’t break if we did not deliver something fresh, something new.”</p><div id="476d4135f0474bc19dbdc418740a2fdb"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>Going forward, developers at Bloober will rely on action and player input to generate disquiet, and they hope that this nudge in creative direction will drastically expand the studio’s audience. This mechanics-first ethos was actually implemented internally in 2019, when Bloober began building the remake of <em>Silent Hill 2 </em>for Konami.</p><p>“We decided that our next titles should be much more mass-market oriented,” Babieno said. “We’d like to talk with more people. We’d like to deliver our ideas, with our DNA, not by environment or storytelling, but by action. So all of our future titles will have a lot of gameplay mechanics. They will be much bigger.”</p><p><em>Silent Hill 2 </em>will be the public’s first taste of Bloober’s redirection — but we’re getting ahead of ourselves. Before considering the implications of fresh design philosophies, let’s take a look at how Bloober Team 2.0 became a major name on the global horror scene in just a few years.</p><p>Babieno co-founded the studio that would become Bloober Team in 2006, after selling his marketing research company in Poland. His ultimate goal was to be a storyteller: He initially considered entering the film industry, but it was too expensive, so he pivoted to games. The studio started with around 15 employees,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>and they focused on building contract games and other quasi-soulless experiences.</p><p>“We crafted some smaller titles on our end, but we never were really good,” Babieno said. “We tried to catch everything on the market and we were just following the crowd. And you know, if you’re following trends, if you’re following what’s fashionable, you can’t be good.”</p><p>Everything changed for Bloober Team in 2015. Though many of us may have blocked this fact from our memories, Bloober is the studio that built <em>Basement Crawl</em>, the worst-reviewed launch game on PlayStation 4. <em>Basement Crawl</em> was essentially a busted <em>Bomberman </em>clone when it came out in 2014, and it was shredded in reviews, settling at a rating of 27 on Metacritic. However, since it was one of just a few games to launch alongside the PS4, it sold well enough.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Bloober tried to make things right by releasing <em>Brawl </em>in 2015, a free game that addressed many of the complaints players had with <em>Basement Crawl</em>.</p><figure><img alt="A screenshot from Basement Crawl, Bloober Team's ill-received PlayStation 4 launch title." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/c2bab900-15cd-11ee-9677-c039a393e198" style="height: 1080px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Bloober Team</div></figure><p>After the release of <em>Brawl</em>, Bloober underwent an internal reckoning. Babieno sat down with his team and had an honest conversation about the studio’s identity and future.</p><p>“It looks like we still don't know how to make something good, and we have a game which has 27 percent on Metacritic, so maybe we should change,” Babieno remembered thinking. “Our decision was, OK, we need to focus on creating something we will be proud of. So that's why we went back to the roots and decided we would like to deliver horror games.”</p><p>Horror has a special, blood-soaked place in Babieno’s heart. He grew up devouring books, films and games with unsettling themes, including works from Stephen King, Graham Masterton and the Silent Hill team at Konami. Fear spoke to him, and as a creator, he saw how it functioned as a shortcut to deep human emotion and universal experiences.</p><p>Babieno took his team’s plan to their investors and laid it all out: “We sat with our funders and told them, guys, we need some money, but we have a pretty good idea for the next 10 years. We would like to become one of the really good psychological horror game developers.” The investors said yes. Bloober Team 2.0 was born.</p><p><em>Layers of Fear</em> came out in 2016 and was a breakout hit, followed by a succession of well-received psychological horror games, including <em>Observer </em>and <em>Blair Witch</em>. But that was just the public side of things: As Bloober was rebranding and cementing itself as a pillar of psychological horror, Babieno was secretly trying to convince Konami to let Bloober make a Silent Hill game.</p><p>Babieno first approached Konami in 2015 with a proposal to make a Silent Hill spin-off game, something completely new in the series. The conversation stayed alive for four years, and finally in 2019, Konami invited Babieno to Japan for a meeting.</p><p>“Almost the whole management board came to the meeting, and they requested us to prepare a pitch for a <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake,” Babieno said. “And <em>whoa</em>. We were so afraid to touch it. We understood from the first day of the conversation that we will have half of the world which will love us and half of the world which will hate us. We are touching something sacred.”</p><p>Other studios were in the running to handle Konami’s secret <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake, but Bloober got the gig. Konami made the official announcement in October 2022.</p><p>Which brings us back to today. The studio just released <em>Layers of Fear</em>, a complete series remastering done in Unreal Engine 5. With this collection, it’s closing the door early on the 10-year plan it laid out for Bloober 2.0 in 2015. A hard pivot worked out well for Bloober once before; it makes some sense to try that again.</p><div id="fc9abf06c8b34d81b230d5b9666717e8"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p><em>Silent Hill 2</em> will be the first title out of Bloober Team 3.0, the studio focused on action-first, mass-market horror games. This is a small but significant shift in Babieno’s direction, but he — and Bloober as a whole — is still obsessed with fear.</p><p>“We are in a very specific moment in history because we have a lot of crises,” Babieno said. He described horror games as a type of catharsis for everyday terror, a safe place where people can dissect their own reactions to intense stimuli and reckon with real-world emotions. He mentioned the pervasive threat of climate change and global economic crises; he pointed out that Bloober is based in Poland, which has a front-row seat to the carnage of the war in Ukraine.</p><p>He continued, “As human beings, we would like to be prepared for something that is unexpected. Those fears are around us … we would like to deliver games that allow us to deal with our fears.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Bloober Team has grown to roughly 230 employees, and one of Babieno’s greatest personal fears is letting them down or having to lay anyone off. As of 2023, Bloober doesn’t do layoffs; in the past three years, he said just five people have left the company. Babieno isn’t actively growing Bloober at the moment and he isn’t looking for a buyer, even as the industry’s biggest publishers are buying talented indie studios left and right. From Babieno’s perspective, Bloober works best as an independent company building AAA-quality games — horror games, to be exact.</p><p>“I would like to stay independent because only then will we be able to make something new, something fresh and creative,” he said. “I don’t want to create games by watching an Excel spreadsheet. I would like to deliver some new milestones of horror, our niche.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/bloober-team-is-done-making-psychological-horror-games-163039512.html?src=rss

<p>It seems a whole lot of people still enjoy the dulcet mews of chocobos and the ever-present Cid, as <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em><a href="https://twitter.com/finalfantasyxvi/status/1674016160306823170"><ins>has sold over three million units</ins></a> since launching on June 22.

The initiative will offer free coursework through LinkedIn, including certification. It’s somewhat ironic since the appeal of generative AI is that it’s dead simple to use: It automates content creation using everyday language. But the courses could still provide tips for composing the most effective prompts while showing beginners the ropes, giving them a chance to keep pace with our rapidly changing world.</p><p>Microsoft’s AI Skills Initiative, part of the company’s Skills for Jobs program, will include free courses created by (Microsoft subsidiary) LinkedIn, offering learners “the first Professional Certificate on Generative AI in the online learning market.” Microsoft says the courses will cover introductory AI concepts and “responsible AI frameworks,” culminating in certification. It’s launching in English only, but the company says it will add Spanish, Portuguese, French, German, Simplified Chinese and Japanese “over the coming months.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition, the company is launching a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/empower-educators-explore-potential-artificial-intelligence/">trainer toolkit for educators</a> with “downloadable, bite-sized content for trainers” and a separate AI course for teachers and other trainers.</p><p>Microsoft also announced an open grant program for AI with an eye on boosting historically marginalized populations. The Generative AI Skills Grant Challenge is a collaboration between data.org, Microsoft’s AI for Good Lab and GitHub. It aims to “explore, develop, and implement how nonprofit, social enterprise and research or academic institutions can train and empower the workforce to use generative AI.” Grant recipients will receive financial support, group learning opportunities, data training / guidance and access to Microsoft events and cloud-computing resources.

<p>Google is about to make it a lot easier for you to buy and rent movies across streamers — for better or worse for your wallet. The company has announced it's adding a Shop tab on Android TV, where you can browse, purchase and store movies.</p><p>Though it looks a bit similar, the Shop tab differs from the Android TV's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-tv-interface-discover-tab-170002365.html">Discover tab</a> in a few ways. Both pages show content from a variety of streaming platforms, but the Discover tab displays recommendations based on your viewing habits, whether or not the titles cost anything to watch. On the other hand, the Shop tab only features content you can, well, <em>shop</em>. Instead of having to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-tv-compose-for-tv-ui-framework-210056293.html">click through each app</a> individually, you can see all the movies that are available to rent or buy across the streamers you subscribe to.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Shop Tab also has a Library section that displays every title you've purchased with your Google account on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-tv-launch-android-tv-os-180529431.html">Google TV devices</a> and its mobile app, Android TV devices and YouTube. Speaking of the Google TV mobile app, you can log in to it on your phone or tablet to download content from your Library for offline access later on. The wait to access this new feature shouldn't be long, as Google reports that the Shop tab will roll out across the US and 23 other countries over the next few weeks.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/android-tvs-new-shop-tab-lets-you-buy-movies-from-different-providers-160012505.html?src=rss

## OnePlus' first foldable phone will reportedly feature a 2K screen

<p>OnePlus might be the next company to jump into the foldable phone space, and it could have a few ways to stand out. Well-known tipster OnLeaks and <em>MySmartPrice</em><a href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/oneplus-fold-specifications-revealed-launch-exclusive/">claim</a> to have specs for the OnePlus Fold (aka OnePlus V Fold), a book-style foldable, and it will apparently deliver top-end performance. It will reportedly revolve around a 7.8-inch &quot;2K&quot; folding screen as well as a 6.3-inch external display (both 120Hz), and would come with a speedy Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip as well as 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. You'd see 48-megapixel regular and ultra-wide cameras on the back, a 64MP telephoto sensor, a 32MP front cam for the external screen and a 20MP selfie shooter when the phone is open.</p><p>The 4,800mAh battery wouldn't be exceptional, and you'd have to be content with 'just' 67W fast wired charging instead of the 100W from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-11-review-price-release-date-cameras-150015371.html">OnePlus 11</a>. And yes, the brand's signature alert slider would make the cut despite the relatively novel form factor.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>OnePlus is rumored to be launching the Fold this August, or about a month after Samsung is unofficially expected to debut the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/leaked-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-render-shows-a-bigger-cover-display-214020400.html">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>. There's no word on pricing, but the claimed hardware could make it expensive.</p><p>The foldable phone category is still relatively small, with North Americans largely having to choose between the Galaxy Z line, Google's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-fold-review-the-challenger-that-samsung-needs-specs-price-170003458.html">Pixel Fold</a> and Motorola's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/moto-razr-review-finally-some-real-competition-for-samsungs-flip-foldables-203033514.html">Razr+</a>. With OnePlus entering the arena, though, there are signs the field is heating up. That's good news for customers, as it might lead to more aggressive pricing and new entrants that were previously content to sit on the sidelines.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-first-foldable-phone-will-reportedly-feature-a-2k-screen-140426945.html?src=rss

## Kia EV9 first drive: Adding a third row to the EV market

<p>It makes sense that a majority of EVs are crossovers. It's a market segment that does well. Sure, they're essentially raised hatchbacks, but they offer enough cargo space and seating for a couple or small family. On the other hand, if you have a large brood or need to transport a lot of supplies, gear, or groceries, the electrification of a three-row vehicle has been slow. Fortunately, the Kia EV9 is here with seating for up to seven and a cavernous cargo space.</p><p>We had a chance to take the Korean-spec EV9 for a first drive in Korea and while the suspension was a bit softer than what we're used to in the United States and there's a good chance that the acceleration will be tweaked to deliver more zip, it delivered the electric vehicle experience we expect from the automaker.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With a targeted range of up to 300 miles and DC fast charging that Kia says will take the 99.8kWh capacity battery from 10 percent to 80 percent in about 24 minutes, the automaker has something that should appeal to families looking for a road trip SUV.

## Shokz OpenFit delivers open-ear audio without bone conduction

<p>The team at Shokz has made a name for itself in the bone conduction headset market over the past several years and they’ve decided to change things up a bit this time around. Today, the company announced its newest headphones and while it's still an open-ear design, it’s not bone conduction. The <a href="https://shokz.com/products/openfit">Shokz OpenFit</a> Bluetooth earbuds ($179.95) are called “air conduction” in a twist on the brand’s bone conduction brethren. Like many open-ear buds before them, they are positioned just outside of your ear with an over-the-ear hook to keep them in place. As a lifestyle headset, they work well, keeping your hearing open (to some degree), staying in place when you move about and are easy to wear for long periods of time.&nbsp;</p><p>The OpenFit seems to bridge the gap between the audio quality of in-ear buds and the situational awareness of bone conduction. They definitely deliver better audio (including bass) than the bone conduction models and still let you hear some of what's going on around you. Sure, they're not quite a replacement for in-ear buds, but that wasn't really the goal. All that said, I found that they can be hit or miss with dance music, since there's an issue with handling hard hits on <em>some</em> low frequency sounds.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Externally, these start off on the same page as most similarly designed earbuds. They come with a charging case, fit over your ear with dolphin arc hooks and to the passer-by, won’t appear unusual. They’re matte black (or beige), made with a soft silicone exterior and feel very lightweight. It’s not outlandish to say you <em>could</em> forget you’re wearing them. They’re definitely lighter and more comfortable than the single-unit bone conduction models Shokz sells, and it’s nice not to have a band around the back.</p><figure><img alt="Close-up images of the Shokz OpenFit open-ear buds in grey. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/6d1a7880-11dd-11ee-b7e5-058e19397e90" style="height: 1200px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Jon Turi / Engadget</div></figure><p>Like many earbuds, Shokz has graciously included touch controls including double-tap and long-press interactions. They respond well to your touches and taps, plus you can customize the functionality in the iOS or Android apps, although the latter won’t be ready at launch. You can use a single bud if you want and keep the other inside the charging case without issue, although you will be limited to that choice’s touch-control setting.</p><p>While Shokz’s previous offerings were primarily geared toward fitness (the OpenComm series aside), the OpenFit is pitched as more of a lifestyle product. They're something you can wear as you go about your day without leaning on digital transparency modes to hear the world. The earbuds themselves are IP54 rated so you’re good if you <em>do</em> work out in them, but the charging case is not. You’ll want to try to remember to wipe them off before stowing them to keep everything in good working order.</p><p>The OpenFit and its ear hook seem to work well at keeping them in place, too. I wouldn’t worry about them falling off if you’re running around, lifting weights, stretching or doing physical activities. It may seem like they could, since they’re not wedged into your ear, but so far I’ve found them to stay put.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="Close-up images of the Shokz OpenFit open-ear buds in grey being worn by someone seen in profile." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/6d28a950-11dd-11ee-afad-f5c82c457377" style="height: 1200px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Jon Turi / Engadget</div></figure><p>As for specs, the Shokz OpenFit earbuds run Bluetooth 5.2, have a frequency response of 50Hz - 16kHz, support AAC and SBC codecs and there are 18 x 11mm customized dynamic drivers inside for the output. The battery life of the buds are rated at up to 7 hours of listening on a charge, with the case said to expand that up to 28 hours of playback. As with previous Shokz headsets, you get an hour's worth of juice with just 5-minutes of charging. That's great if you notice a low charge before heading out on a run with just OpenFit and a smartwatch or phone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>One of the frequent issues with bone conduction headsets has been the lack of bass. Shokz came a long way towards cracking the case with their latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/aftershokz-shokz-openrun-pro-bone-conduction-headphones-bass-030031419.html">OpeRun Pro</a> headset. The OpenFit aren't bone conduction, so it was easier for the company to deliver a pumped up low-end profile.</p><p>If you’re a Shokz fan, you’ll probably enjoy these, especially for casual daily use at lower volumes. They work well for music and spoken word, and unlike the bone conduction models you’ll have better luck hearing your music if you’re in a busier environment. Although, keep in mind these are still open-ear models, so your listening experience isn’t totally isolated.</p><p>I've worn these while going to the store and doing other errands. If you keep music playing at normal or low volumes, you can enjoy tunes while also listening to and conversing with cashiers and other people around you. While you <em>can </em>take phone calls with a double tap, I chose to ditch them with a long press when interacting as a courtesy.</p><figure><img alt="Close-up images of the Shokz OpenFit open-ear buds in grey. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/6d28d060-11dd-11ee-a5ac-4d0a904d8990" style="height: 1200px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Jon Turi / Engadget</div></figure><p>You can<em>&nbsp;</em>even ride your bike while wearing these and still hear what’s going on around you if you’re careful with the volume. Bone conduction headphones (the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/aftershokz-shokz-openrun-pro-bone-conduction-headphones-bass-030031419.html">Shokz OpenRun Pro</a> specifically) are a more optimized situational awareness headset though, and visibly leave both ears open in case <a href="https://brooklynfixedgear.com/law-and-safety/is-it-illegal-to-bike-with-headphones/">local laws</a> have restrictions.</p><p>If you’re the type of person who enjoys cranking up your tunes, there are some caveats. The overall listening experience does offer rich bass, along with good mids and highs for this form factor. But if you tend to listen to dance music or hip hop, you may notice an issue with the handling of some very low-end kick drums. On some songs, mostly with hard hitting bits at low frequencies, you may notice a crunchy edge to those beats. If you get the opportunity to test them first, I’d bring something along these lines to check your experience.</p><p>Listening to The Dave Brubeck Quartet’s “<a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL29wZW4uc3BvdGlmeS5jb20vdHJhY2svM2tLNjZHaldZOEVjc3hCa1NFbTQzVD9zaT03YWQ5M2I3NmEwMGE0ZGEzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI5ZDJlZGM3Mi1iNzBhLTQwZTktODg2Mi0yODczNGE0MTdlNWEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdTr3WqTIfSgRD-Ggl9qIl_5rwx39vdNLPuNBIRQMIIA&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2Ftrack%2F3kK66GjWY8EcsxBkSEm43T%3Fsi%3D7ad93b76a00a4da3">Three to Get Ready</a>” was clear and pleasant, with a natural sound and smooth basslines.

The iOS version will be available at launch, with the Android version arriving at a later date. Using the app, you can select from EQ presets or create your own, customize the touch controls, control playback and view battery levels for each earbud as well as the charging case.</p><p>There are two types of touch controls available, which are double tap and press-and-hold. You can select from pre-set combinations, which seem to cover enough options to satisfy most people. They’re a mix of play/pause, previous/next, voice assistant and lastly volume control (which is only available for the press-and-hold interaction).</p><p>The standard EQ preset seems to be the most common choice for most listening.

## 'Project Loki' looks like a rad mix of 'League of Legends' and 'Fortnite'

<p>For nearly eight years, Joe Tung was responsible for leading development on Riot’s hit MOBA, <em>League of Legends</em>. At the end of 2020, he left the company to cofound Theorycraft Games. Since then, the studio, which employs people who contributed to <em>League</em>, <em>Valorant</em>, <em>Overwatch</em>, the Halo series, <em>Destiny</em> and <em>Apex Legends</em>, has been quietly working away on its first project, a game codenamed <em>Project Loki. </em>Before today, only a handful of content creators and pro-gamers have had the chance to play <em>Loki</em>. That’s about to change, with Theorycraft announcing a two-day PC playtest that will start tomorrow, June 29th.</p><div id="e09d934bff39449eb95c95f15c5d2299"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>Theorycraft describes <em>Project Loki </em>as a squad-based hero battleground. Imagine a game that has MOBA-like heroes who need to nail skill shots to perform their best. Now, instead of pitting those characters against one another on a map with minion lanes and towers, you force them to fight on a large, <em>Fortnite-</em>inspired battleground. That’s the pitch of <em>Project Loki</em>, and<em>&nbsp;</em>the studio hopes it turns out to be the next game you decide to spend 10,000 hours playing with your friends. One thing Tung, whose past credits also include <em>Halo: Reach</em>, says is a core part of <em>Project Loki</em> is player creativity. Each session starts with you and your teammates choosing a group of heroes you think will win you the match, and will need to adapt your strategies on the fly.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Tung says Theorycraft Games is a “small and very independent game studio,” but it has the backing of venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, which took part in the company’s <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220922005227/en/Theorycraft-Games-Raises-50-Million-to-Maintain-Long-Term-Focus-on-Talent-and-Game"><ins>$50 million</ins></a> series B fundraising round last year. In other words, there’s a lot of money riding on the bet that Theorycraft can create the next <em>LoL</em> or <em>Apex Legends</em>. Expect to hear more about the game in the weeks and months ahead. You can sign up to playtest <em>Project Loki </em>on <a href="https://www.theorycraftgames.com/">Theorycraft's website</a>.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/project-loki-looks-like-a-rad-mix-of-league-of-legends-and-fortnite-130053005.html?src=rss

<p>Peloton is continuing to gamify its hardware lineup with the launch of Lanebreak Tread, a software experience for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/peloton-tread-plus-recall-settlement-214734408.html">its beleaguered line of treadmills.</a> The software suite looks similar to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/peloton-lanebreak-videogame-215537833.html">pre-existing racing experiences</a> for the company’s exercise bike line, and Lanebreak for Peloton cycles is a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/peloton-lanebreak-irl-140011434.html">well-regarded bit of gamification,</a> so the bona-fides are solid.</p><p>Lanebreak Tread is getting a global launch, with availability for all Peloton Tread members. Peloton says the gameplay involves users matching and sustaining a pre-set inclines and speeds to rack up high scores. Animations help the users along and the whole thing is set to a “beat pumping soundtrack.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The software makes full use of the Tread hardware, as it automatically adjusts the speed and incline to match what is happening in the game. There’s a new mechanic specifically for interval workouts, updated visuals for runners, new avatars and an array of pace-based difficulty options.</p><p>Levels vary according to the chosen playlist and workout type, with difficulty levels ranging from beginner to expert. Each game level lasts anywhere from five to 30 minutes, to suit workouts of varying lengths. You also have plenty of music genres to choose from here, including pop, electronic, hip hop, rock, metal, country and, well, just about everything else. There’s no classical music though, as running to Bach would feel weird. Peloton’s new Lanebreak Tread software releases today for the entire line of branded treadmills.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/peloton-expands-its-gamified-exercise-experience-to-treadmills-130040617.html?src=rss

## DoorDash will start offering couriers an hourly rate while they're fulfilling orders

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/doordash/"><ins>DoorDash</ins></a> says it will offer couriers a guaranteed hourly rate for &quot;active delivery time&quot; as part of a raft of changes to its platform. The company says that this rate will be in addition to tips — couriers keep 100 percent of tips from customers.</p><p>The Earn by Time option will sit alongside <a href="https://help.doordash.com/consumers/s/article/How-do-Dasher-earnings-work">the existing model</a> that sees Dashers receiving a payment for each order they carry out. Currently, they receive a base payment that depends on the estimated duration, distance and &quot;desirability&quot; of the order, along with tips and potentially promotional payments. Couriers can choose whether they want to be paid by time or per order for each delivery, and they'll see the minimum payment they'll get for both options before selecting.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The hourly rate will differ depending on the market, and it's prorated. Dashers will only be paid for the time between picking up an order and delivering it, but not while they're on their way to pick up the items. So if the Earn by Time rate is $15 per hour and it takes 20 minutes to carry out a delivery, the dasher will receive $5 plus any tips. Meanwhile, consumers will have the option to add or increase their tip after the delivery. They'll have up to 30 days to do so.</p><figure><img alt="DoorDash screenshots showing the option to tip a courier after delivery." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/69d1f470-1523-11ee-9fe5-fde6af87dc4d" style="height: 1786px; width: 1872px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">DoorDash</div></figure><p>The minimum rate is coming into play ahead of New York City <a href="https://www.engadget.com/new-york-city-sets-an-18-per-hour-minimum-wage-for-food-delivery-workers-193338002.html"><ins>starting to enforce a minimum wage for food delivery workers</ins></a>. By July 12th, delivery apps will need to start paying their couriers in the city a minimum of $17.96 per hour plus tips. Engadget has asked DoorDash for details on how Earn by Time aligns with this minimum wage and the rollout plans for this option.</p><p>Elsewhere, a new initiative for Dashers aims to reduce downtime by allowing them to take on orders while they're on the way to the area they prefer to work in. DoorDash is introducing a new safety feature for couriers as well. They'll be able to share their real-time location with trusted contacts.</p><p>Along with new features for Dashers and merchants, DoorDash is revamping things for customers with its biggest app update so far. DoorDash will support online SNAP and EBT payments, making it easier for those who are enrolled in those programs to place orders through the app. You'll be able to order from more than 4,000 grocery locations across the US, including participating Aldi, Albertsons, Safeway, Meijer and 7-Eleven stores. DoorDash is also offering SNAP recipients two months of free <a href="https://www.engadget.com/doordash-dashpass-for-students-cheaper-subscription-145631312.html"><ins>DashPass</ins></a> access.</p><p>DoorDash will roll out the update to all users over the next few months. The new features include universal search, so you can look for a specific item, retailer or restaurant from almost anywhere in the app. There will be new tabs at the bottom of the screen called Browse, Grocery and Retail (the latter of which DoorDash describes as &quot;a modern-day mall directory&quot;). There will also be multiple carts as well. When you get peckish while filling out a grocery order, you can save your progress, order something for dinner and then continue where you left off.</p><figure><img alt="Sceenshots of the grocery tab in the updated DoorDash app, showing users how they can order grocery items." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/80d86240-1522-11ee-a97f-bea4f2870ad7" style="height: 1796px; width: 2668px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">DoorDash</div></figure><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/doordash-will-start-offering-couriers-an-hourly-rate-while-theyre-fulfilling-orders-120032368.html?src=rss

## The Morning After: TikTok is killing off its BeReal clone

<p>TikTok says it's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-is-jumping-off-the-bereal-bandwagon-by-killing-tiktok-now-125023950.html">discontinuing TikTok Now</a>, its attempt to replicate last year's social media sensation BeReal. According to screenshots posted by several users, parent ByteDance is &quot;updating the TikTok experience and discontinuing TikTok Now.&quot; TikTok Now had a nearly identical approach to viral hit BeReal, requiring users to take front and rear photos simultaneously. It added the ability to take 10-second TikTok-like videos instead of photos, obviously making it <em>completely</em> different. Snapchat and Instagram have both attempted to copy (or tested) their own BeReal-ish features.</p><p>The feature was part of the main TikTok app in the US, but is also available as a standalone TikTok Now app in other regions. The message sent to TikTok users in the US indicated that the feature was being killed in the main app, but there's no word on the separate TikTok Now app.</p><p>BeReal, meanwhile, might be contending with a drop-off in interest, according to a report from <em>The New York Times</em> in April. BeReal refuted an analytics report behind the story, though, saying it still had 20 million daily active users.</p><p>– Mat Smith</p><p></p><p><em>The Morning After isn’t just a</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/"><em> newsletter</em></a><em> –  it’s also a daily podcast.

In April of this year, the company’s board of directors suspended CEO Abraham Shafi and appointed a new acting CEO. Due to those incredibly inflated numbers (and half-baked concept), IRL is shutting down and taking its 19 million bots with it. The company says it’s returning capital to shareholders, but nobody knows how much money is left in the coffers.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/softbank-gave-170m-to-a-social-app-whose-users-mostly-didnt-exist-162947228.html"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-morning-after-tiktok-is-killing-off-its-bereal-clone-111553066.html?src=rss

That's a substantial price drop for a $50 product that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazons-redesigned-echo-buds-are-only-50-140055204.html">launched in May</a> and only started shipping on June 7th. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html">wireless earbuds</a> are already cheaper than their predecessors, but this makes them an even more attractive option if you're looking for an affordable pair. Amazon gave the new Echo Buds a completely different design from earlier versions and adopted an AirPods-like stickbud aesthetic. The company describes the new earbuds as "semi in-ear," most likely because their silicone buds don't form a tight seal to keep ambient sounds out.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Amazon says the earbuds can reduce outside noise, but they let in enough sounds to keep you connected to your surroundings. They can play up to five hours of music non-stop and can last for up to 20 hours with the charging case before you need to plug them in. If you run out battery and need to use them ASAP, they can last up to two hours with a 15-minute quick charge.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The earbuds can seamlessly switch their connection, so you can quickly move between two different devices. They have customizable tap controls, but they also have Alexa, Siri and Google Assistant support, allowing you to issue voice commands to cue music, listen to audiobooks, make calls and set reminders, among other things. In addition, they feature dual connect, which means you can use just one earbud if you want.&nbsp;</p><p>If you'd prefer earbuds with Active Noise Cancellation, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDg1V1RZUTRYP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTFtZy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOWM5NWJkZTYtNDNlZi00YmU3LTgwNGItYmJlNzc3MzllZWNkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAXIXEpILnma46VkmRARGhl8ope-1UbxGESQjv-3ZIMCk&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB085WTYQ4X">Amazon's second-generation Echo Buds</a> are also on sale if you're a Prime member.

<p>There's something so satisfying about finally getting to play the game you love on your console of choice. Rail shooter, <em>Air Twister</em>, is the latest video game to make the jump, with <a href="https://www.iningames.com/games/air-twister/">ININ Games announcing it will be released</a> on PS4 and PS5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox and PC. <em>Air Twister</em> first came on the scene in 2022 exclusively for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-apple-arcade-games-140053796.html">Apple Arcade</a>.&nbsp;</p><div id="969229d4640641a790d1fe2b47256371"></div><p><em>Air Twister</em> is the brainchild of Yu Suzuki, who designed classic hits like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/500-run-arcade-cabinet-relives-220100636.html"><em>Out Run</em></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-06-13-deja-review-virtua-fighter-5-final-showdown.html"><em>Virtua Fighter</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-12-06-segas-3d-classics-making-old-games-stand-out.html"><em>Space Harrier</em></a>, and follows Princess Arch on a mission to prevent her planet's total destruction (<em>no pressure</em>). Suzuki credits <em>Air Twister</em> as a twist on a game he first thought of in the 80s but wasn't possible to create with the technology of the time. It features 12 unique stages and ten alien bosses — including a clock and candelabra that look straight out of <em>Beauty and the Beast</em>. You can choose from modes such as Boss Rush, Arcade and Turbo as you explore a series of minigames and unlock new challenges through the Adventure Map, all with the backdrop of new and rerecorded songs from Dutch composer Valensia.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You'll have to wait until November 10th to help Princess Arch defend her planet from invaders on your PC or console.

## Google is no longer building its own augmented reality glasses

<p>Google has killed a project internally known as "Iris" that it established to build augmented reality glasses, according to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-ar-iris-augmented-reality-smart-glasses-2023-6"><em>Business Insider</em></a>. The tech giant worked on the glasses' development for several years, but it reportedly shelved Iris following <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-parent-alphabet-is-laying-off-12000-employees-105523115.html">waves of layoffs</a> and company reshuffles over the past few months. Another event that factored into Google's decision was the departure of Clay Bavor, the company's former chief of augmented and virtual reality, to form a startup with Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor. In addition, Google reportedly kept changing its strategy for the Iris glasses, which became a source of frustration for team members working on the project.&nbsp;</p><p>When<em>&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22892152/google-project-iris-ar-headset-2024"><em>The Verge</em></a> reported about the Iris augmented reality glasses in early 2022, it said that Google could <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-ar-headset-leak-173237029.html">launch the device</a> in 2024. The Iris AR glasses were supposed to look like a pair of ordinary glasses. and an early version reportedly resembled a product called "<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-23-north-focals-smart-glasses-hands-on.html">Focals</a>" by North, a Canadian startup that Google had acquired in 2020.

Instead of building its own hardware, Google has apparently chosen to focus on creating an "Android for AR" instead. The company is reportedly hoping to adopt the same business model it's using for its mobile platform and license its AR software to manufacturers. At the moment, Google is busy developing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-extended-reality-xr-vr-ar-devices-181919030.html">Android XR for Samsung's "extended reality"</a> wearable devices and, according to <em>Insider</em>, on a new platform called "micro XR" for glasses.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-is-no-longer-building-its-own-augmented-reality-glasses-062555498.html?src=rss
