<blockquote>If one of my kids when they were younger came home and presented ss a cat, what I would do is I would give them a bowl of kitty cat [food]and a saucer of milk. Then at half past ten at night, they'd be kicked out of the house and told to come back at about six o'clock in the morning. And then when they want to go to the toilet, they'd use a litter tray. I'll ell you what, when mum and dad are going away for a fortnight to Greece or Spain in the summer, you're going in a cattery. They wouldn't be a cat. They'd be a child again.</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>On the surface, it sounds like a ridiculous comparison. The problem is <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1783954/conservative-mp-lee-anderson-gbnews-cat" target="_blank">he's addressing a very specific incident</a>. A middle school girl was called a bigot by her teacher <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/13-year-old-girl-gender" target="_blank">for not affirming her classmate's gender as a cat</a>. The teacher freaked out over the girl's instance that you're either a boy or a girl: "If you don’t like it you need to go to a different school. I’m reporting you to [senior staff], you need to have a proper educational conversation about equality, diversity, and inclusion because I’m not having that expressed in my lesson."</p><p>In Australia, a student also <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/cat-private-school" target="_blank">identifies as a cat because</a>, and I want to quote this verbatim, <em>"No one seems to have a protocol for students identifying as animals."</em> However, as long as it doesn't "disrupt the school", everyone is being supportive. Unclear is if she communicates with "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/cat-woman-explains-meows" target="_self">very specific meows</a>" like other catgenders.</p><p>It makes you wonder if students REALLY go along with this. Or do they pretend to because they don't want to get canceled on social media? I doubt either cat person would be competitive in swimming since cats hate water. But if a girl who identifies as a cat ran track and was dominating the girls who identify as people, I can see some saying there's an unfair advantage. Cats are faster being able to run on all fours, while people can only run on two legs.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>As of this writing, there are no confirmed incidents of American schools demanding students be affirmed by their chosen cat gender. It's coming, and will quickly become the latest thing for the Democrat Party to support. Joe Biden will make sure catgenders have a plank on his party's platform. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Watch: Roseanne Barr goes OFF over the left's failed attempt to cancel her over "Holocaust" comment (Exclusive)

<img src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=34204846&amp;width=980" /><br /><br /><p>Two weeks ago, Roseanne Barr was on a podcast where she did a bit about what YouTube says are allowable opinions. In that bit, the word "Holocaust" was used. Anyone with half a brain that's not shoved off their rectum knows it was a bit and could detect the sarcasm in her delivery. Yet a leftist douchelord cut out ONLY the sixteen seconds where the word "Holocaust" was used and Barr trended all day under the guise she denied the Holocaust ever happened.</p><p>Not the first time <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/oh-my-roseanne-barr-returns-with-another-attack-on-valerie-jarrett" target="_blank">leftists have tried canceling her</a> over <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/breaking-abc-cancels-roseanne-reboot-after-valerie-jarrett-comments" target="_blank">an out-of-context joke</a>. She was on Louder with Crowder today to discuss how few f*cks she has to give.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>"That was a joke. This was a bit that I have done on stage. I'm a comedian. [Leftists] take my joke and what they did was they left out the premise."</p><p>Ironically, this week marked the 33rd anniversary of the first time people tried canceling Roseanne <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/mlb/news/roseanne-barr-national-anthem-video-padres-reds-oral-history-25th-anniversary/jf1o4z9qe1ai13ot11z0w58cl" target="_blank">after her rendition of the National Anthem.</a> Only then, it was conservatives doing the canceling. Roseanne told Crowder that we were much nicer about it.</p><p>"The Right was a lot kinder. They accepted my apology and I was invited back a few times to sing the National Anthem. On the Left, these guys never accept an apology and they never stop. They keep coming until they grind their jackboot right into your face. I guess they don't just want you deplatformed, they want you dead. And if you have the gumption to raise your head up bloodied, they get more blood lust. And come at you again."</p><p>To bring everyone up to speed, Roseanne was on fellow comedian Theo Von's podcast TWO WEEKS AGO. She did a bit about how YouTube decides what opinions you aren't and aren't allowed to have.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

	Pro-tip. If you are the CEO of a company with the largest marketing debacle in history, one that cost your company tens of billions of dollars, and agrees to address the controversy on a nationwide television show... if you're not going to address the controversy, don't go on the show. Someone should have told Anheuser-Busch CEO Brendan Whitworth that before appearing on <em>CBS Mornings</em>.
</p><p>
	He refused to answer whether the promotional campaign with titface performer Dylan Mulvaney was a mistake. Spoiler: the fact that you have to address it on national television, it was.

<blockquote>There’s a big social conversation taking place right now with big brands right in the middle of it. It’s not just our industry or Bud Light. It’s happening in retail, it’s happening in fast food. For us, what we need to understand — deeply understand and appreciate — is the consumer. What they want, what they care about, and what they expect from big brands.</blockquote><p>M'kay. So, the reason the social conversation is taking place is because of the Bud Light debacle. What the consumer expects from big brands is to sell us things and otherwise shut up about anything else. Also, more important than the Mulvaney thing was the vice president of Bud Light calling <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-leave-absence" target="_blank">its loyal customers "fratty and out of touch."</a> Once customers realized how much Bud Light hates them, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-dethroned-beer-america" target="_blank">THAT'S when things popped off</a>. The "social conversation" is because executives from Bud Light come from the same ideology as executives from <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/target-diversity-inclusion" target="_blank">Target</a>, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/coca-cola-less-white" target="_blank">Coca-Cola</a>, and so on.</p><p>But back to if there are any regrets about teaming up with a TikTok ingénue who became popular making videos that parodied women. He was asked again if it was a mistake.</p><blockquote>Bud Light has supported LGBTQ since 1998. As we said from the beginning, we’ll continue to support the communities and organizations we’ve supported for decades. As we move forward, we’ll focus on what we do best, which is brewing great beer for everyone, listening to our consumers, being humble and listen to them … and ultimately make an impact on the communities that we serve.</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>Why even bother giving the interview? One quick glance at Twitter shows it has satisfied no one. The Left is pissed Whitworth didn't take the opportunity to affirm their every political worldview and tell middle America to go f*ck itself. And Bud Light's now former customers, the normal folks in the middle who are tired of companies pandering to the woke Left and shoving it in their faces, still haven't heard four simple words, "Yeah, we f*ck up."</p><p>This interview fixed nothing.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Google defends Christians, drops sponsorship of blasphemous drag show after employees complained

But they were sponsoring a drag show to celebrate the end of Pride month. A group of Christian employees launched a petition against it. And Google, when no one was looking, dropped their sponsorship. The most surprising thing in that paragraph... there are enough Christian employees at Google to launch a petition.</p><p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/27/google-distances-itself-from-drag-performance-after-employee-petition.html" target="_blank">CNBC is reporting</a> the Big Tech overlords removed a “Pride and Drag Show” scheduled for Tuesday from its sponsored series of LGBTQ Pride events. The group of Christian employees took offense with drag artist Peaches Christ. It was a performance that was supposed to, quote, “wrap up this amazing month."</p><blockquote>The petition accused Google of religious discrimination for sponsoring an event and a performer that sexualizes and disrespects the Christian faith.</blockquote><blockquote>“Their provocative and inflammatory artistry is considered a direct affront to the religious beliefs and sensitivities of Christians,” the petition said of Peaches Christ.</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="04eb7" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=34204036&amp;width=980" />
</p>
<p>Though it's not like Google took a brave stance. They removed the sponsorship when no one was looking, and claimed the sponsorship -- which was up all month -- was removed because it went up without being fully approved by the company. Per a statement <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/06/27/google-drops-drag-show-sponsorship-after-christian-employee-petition/" target="_blank">to the New York Post</a>: "This particular event was booked by and shared within one team without going through our standard events process. While the event organizers have shifted the official team event onsite, the performance will go on at the planned venue – and it’s open to the public, so employees can still attend.”</p><p>Google also refuses to say if the Christian employees' petition had anything to do with the decision to drop sponsorship. As I said, the barest minimum.</p><p>It's similar to the Los Angeles Dodgers situation. No one had a problem with the team having Pride Night. But when it came to a blasphemous group of Anti-Catholic queens call the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence (you may remember them from this 2019 classic, "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/another-child-sex-offender-discovered-at-drag-queen-story-time" target="_self" title="view post: ANOTHER Child Sex Offender Discovered at 'Drag Queen Story Time'">ANOTHER Child Sex Offender Discovered at 'Drag Queen Story Time'</a>") who mocked the Crucifixion of Christ, Dodgers attempted to do the barest minimum by uninviting this one group. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/los-angeles-dodgers-sisters-indulgence" target="_blank">They were quickly made to bend the knee</a>. Pride Month means being forced to affirm every kink.</p><p>I guess with Google, at the very least they didn't cave and announce they were sponsoring the show after all. We can call that a win, kinda sorta.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

He demanded harsher penalties for it and was unsympathetic to crack cocaine users. This was when it was prominent in more urban areas. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-systemic" target="_blank">I'll let you decide if that's why Biden was so vocal about it</a>. Since then, people from all walks of life have been known to smoke rock. Most notably is <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/hunter-biden-prositutes-union" target="_blank">prostitute aficionado</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/biden-text-son-leak" target="_blank">racial slur connoisseur</a> Hunter Biden. Someone on Rumble (no way this stays up on YouTube) thought it would be educational to see the elder Biden speaking out on the drug while young Biden listens. And gets high as f***.</p><p>That sound you hear is tens of thousands of right-leaning content creators smacking their forehead that they didn't think of this themselves. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</p><p>Yes, "independent" "fact" checkers. This is an edited video. Hunter Biden was not actually smoking crack while his father gave this speech.</p><p>Is this mean to share? I'm not here to judge. Only to share a video that is going viral. There are some who believe that a president's children are off-limits to personal attacks. A sentiment I agree with. We should treat Hunter Biden with the exact same level of respect the mainstream media has treated <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/stephen-colbert-accuses-donald-trump-jr-of-being-on-cocaine" target="_blank">Donald Trump Jr.</a>.

## NBC News defends LGBTQ activists chanting "we're coming for your children," says they've been chanting it for years

	At some point in recent history, media companies started hiring the dumbest social media associates. They always hired progressives. I don't think you can get a job in media today unless you hate the half the country that disagrees with you. But when it comes to the people who tweet for them, only the chuckleheadiest of progressives get the job. Exhibit Q is this NBC News tweet defending LGBTQ activists chanting "we're coming for your children."

</p><p><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nyc-drag-march" target="_blank">Over the weekend at a drag march in New York City</a> (of course), the marchers were chanting "we're here, we're queer, and we're coming for your children." It was an odd chant because I thought, per the shrill harpies from <em>The View</em>, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ana-navarro-the-view-queens" target="_blank">drag queens don't like children</a>. </p><p>Political observers believe the marchers were speaking out against common sense "leave our kids alone" laws where some states are restricting children from being allowed to watch raunchy sex shows. Our corporate journalismers keep creating content that claims these normal states are trying to outlaw "drag." 8 out of 10 of these corporate journalisming content creators also believe it's illegal to scream "GAY" in a crowded Florida movie theater.</p><p>Conservatives and the normal parts of America between New York City and California were bothered by this viral video since, you know, they said they were coming after our children. As is the case, NBC News created content NOT about the chant but about conservatives reacting to the chant. It falls under the "Republicans seize" genre. The story is never about the bad thing that liberals do. The story is always about how conservatives react to the bad things liberals do.</p><p>In this case, NBC News journalismers came to the defense of leftists and other queens letting America know they are coming for our children by claiming the "we're coming for your children" chant is a popular one that has been going on for years. That's it. That's NBC News' defense.</p><p>And they did a sh*t job of making it, as you can see by the Community Notes on the tweet: <em>The news articles provides no evidence of the “we’re coming for your children” chant being done for years at pride nor does it quote specific individuals that make this claim. This is very irresponsible reporting.</em></p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>My favorite part about this NBC News tweet? There will be a poll coming out that claims journalism is one of if not the least trusted institutions in America. No one working at NBC News will understand why.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
