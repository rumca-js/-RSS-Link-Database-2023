Resentful at the world, 15-year-old Aristotle Mendoza wants to blend in and be left alone, but the summer he meets free spirit Dante Quintana at the local swimming pool, everything changes. Dante is everything Ari isn't, and his wanderlust for life and artistic spirit shake something loose in Ari; finally, he has a friend. A near-magical being, Dante disrupts Aristotle’s world, introducing him to music, poetry, and lessons about the sky. Dante gives Aristotle permission to live in an ever-expansive universe, making it harder and harder for him to maintain the façade of isolation that has protected him for so long. Their summer of adventure comes to an abrupt halt when the boys are torn apart. Armed with a new perspective, Aristotle uses Dante’s absence to understand who he wants to be in the world. Ari must decide if he is going to live in the world of infinite possibilities that Dante represents. At first, fear holds Aristotle hostage and he retreats into his lonely existence. But Ari soon realizes he can’t unsee the world through Dante’s eyes. If only he would let go of the secrets he didn’t even know he was keeping and embrace the wonders of the universe.

Fight Forever: AEW reviewed by Jarrett Green on PlayStation 5. Also available on PlayStation 4, Xbox, and PC. “Unrealized potential” feels like the story of AEW: Fight Forever as a whole. So much of it feels like a very good start, going full gear with bouncy animations, the quick pace of the action, and fun and effective character design. But almost all of its good ideas are hampered by bugs and opaque or outright useless systems. Its big single-player mode is poorly written and, though it's a relative breeze to complete and full of branching options, it’s all out of good ways to point you to them. There’s a strong foundation to bet double or nothing on in a sequel down the road, and I think there's still fun to be had here with like-minded friends who are content with casually beating each other up, but this is no wrestling game revolution.

Here are 49 times Final Fantasy 16 is pretty much just Game of Thrones! FF16 producer Naoki Yoshida has made no secret about drawing inspiration from GoT for the latest epic in the long-running series, but the influence of George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire goes way beyond its British medieval roots. Check out these similarities between FF16 and Game of Thrones and let us know if you spotted any others in the comments.

From FF16 Clive being Jon Snow, to the Iron Kingdom and a Hodor impersonator, here are all the times that we spotted Final Fantasy 16 basically copying Game of Thrones.

Final Fantasy XVI is available now on PS5.

Here's the terrifying trailer for the upcoming Dying Light 2 update: Good Night, Good Luck. Arriving as part of the game's Summer of Horrors, the update overhauls the night experience - ushering in darker nights by significantly reducing visibility and having the infected, like Volatiles, show up in more locations. The Good Night, Good Luck update introduces more parkour improvements including new animations, increased control while airborne, and the ability to maintain momentum. There's also a new parkour style so players can decide whether they want more control over their movement (Physical mode) or whether they prefer assisted gameplay. Explore Dying Light 2's Community Maps, which are coming to PC as part of the update and will be coming to consoles and Steam Deck soon.

Dying Light 2's Good Night, Good Luck update arrives on June 29, 2023. Its Summer of Horrors period will host a series of events, crossovers, and updates throughout the season, into September this year. Players can also check out the Bloody Nights Event, which runs from June 29 to July 13. Beware of Volatiles as you prepare to loot valuables in the dead of night and earn rewards.

Park Beyond reviewed on PC by Justin Koreis. Also available on Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5.

"Park Beyond does a great job tapping into the childhood whimsy that theme parks can elicit. There's a great sense of wonder to be had by impossifying rides, and the simple interface makes it easy to do. Incrementally unlocking new rides and increasing park capacity is rewarding, and creating something utterly ludicrous can be a blast. But that joy dissipates quickly when parks become unmanageable, as the attendees get stuck, staff ignores pressing needs, and financial ruin springs seemingly out of nowhere, while bugs and crashes make a late-campaign difficulty spike a miserable slog. Like riding an unfinished roller coaster, there’s fun to be had until the eventual crash, but it feels like this park just isn’t ready to be opened."
