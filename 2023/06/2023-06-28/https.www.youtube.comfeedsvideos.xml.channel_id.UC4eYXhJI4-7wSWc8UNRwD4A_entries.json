Together, these artists represent the past, present and future of Black music. This month of carefully curated shows is a celebration of Black artists expressing themselves in ways we've never seen before, and of the Tiny Desk's unique way of showcasing that talent.\n\nMitra I. Arthur | June 28, 2023\nOn a beautifully ornate harp and clad in a stunning yellow printed catsuit, Brandee Younger starts her Tiny Desk with a composition dating back to the 1900s \u2014 \u201cLift Every Voice and Sing,\u201d colloquially known as the \u201cBlack National Anthem\u201d \u2014 then transitions into the title track of her newest album, Brand New Life. This particular transition between past and present is fitting as Younger, like harpists Alice Coltrane and Dorothy Ashby before her, has made a career of showcasing the role of the harp, a classical instrument dating back to antiquity, in not only contemporary popular music, but moreover, in music genres rooted in Black culture: jazz, R&amp;B, and hip-hop. \n\nAs she reflected after her Desk on being included in NPR Music\u2019s celebration of Black Music Month, Younger remarked: \u201cWhen you think of harps and harpists, you don't necessarily think of \u2018Black\u2019. And so to be a part of that conversation as a harpist, it's a big deal.\u201d Her collaborations range from Robert Glasper and Makaya McCraven, to Moses Sumney, Ms. Lauryn Hill and Pete Rock. Compositions from her 2021 album, Somewhere Different, garnered her a Grammy nomination for best instrumental composition \u2014 the first for a Black woman \u2014  and an entry on NPR Music\u2019s 100 Best songs of 2021 list.\n\nFor her Tiny Desk, Younger presents some of her newest entries into the jazz harp canon. \u201cBrand New Life\u201d and \u201cMoving Target\u201d feature vocalist Tatiana \u201cLadyMay\u201d Mayfield\u2019s ethereal voice perfectly complimenting the transcendental tones of the harp, which is expanded into a one woman choir of sound through the use of vocal pedals. Younger closes with \u201cUnrest I\u201d and \u201cUnrest II,\u201d composed during the height of both the COVID-19 pandemic and 2020\u2019s Black Lives Matter protests. In these two movements, Younger, drummer Allan Mednard and bassist Rashaan Carter stunningly convey a maelstrom of tension, confusion, upheaval and release, emotions undoubtedly present in many who similarly witnessed a world in confusion outside their windows at this time.\n\n\nSET LIST\n\u201cLift Ev\u2019ry Voice and Sing\u201d\n\u201cBrand New Life\u201d\n\u201cMoving Target\u201d\n\u201cUnrest I\" \n\u201cUnrest II\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS\nBrandee Younger: harp\nRashaan Carter: bass\nAllan Mednard: drums\nTatiana Mayfield: vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Mitra I.
