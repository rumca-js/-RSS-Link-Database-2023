Hello and welcome to VIRTUALLY ODD!

This is a special episode. I FINALLY got my hands on the one headset I have been looking for for the past 4 years. It's nearly impossible to obtain but it boasts some of the most impressive specs I have ever seen on a VR device.. and its from a few years ago even!

Turns out that the story behind StarVR is more interesting than the hardware even. So, lets take a deep dive and fall into the deep rabbit hole of my dream VR headset- a device that almost changed the world. 

This is a story that goes beyond Quest 2 and Index and into the annals of VR history all the way back the the very beginning.
