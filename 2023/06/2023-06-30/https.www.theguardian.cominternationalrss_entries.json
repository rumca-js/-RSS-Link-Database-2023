Before then, I\u2019d sensed that they were somehow different from me, that there was a line that separated us. They didn\u2019t use the telephone; their doorbell had a flashing light and not a bell; and maybe Mum and Dad had told me that Nanny and Grandpa couldn\u2019t hear. But it was when I was three that I decided to experiment on my grandma.</p><p>She was stooped over the sink, washing the dishes. I stood behind her and screamed with all the force my little frame could muster. She didn\u2019t flinch. I howled, cried for help, thinking surely she\u2019d respond to that. Nothing. In my indignation, my temper rose. I stomped on the ground, at which point Nanny turned around. \u201cI hate you,\u201d I snarled, and watched as the colour drained from her face. I knew then that she hadn\u2019t heard me, but she\u2019d understood. Afterwards, when I found my grandmother sobbing in the bedroom, I patted her hands and stroked her back, like Mum would do for me when I was sad. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I mouthed, making sure this time that she\u2019d seen my lips.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/01/what-i-learned-from-deaf-grandparents-the-mark-of-a-good-heart-can-be-found-on-a-face\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/01/what-i-learned-from-deaf-grandparents-the-mark-of-a-good-heart-can-be-found-on-a-face", "date_published": "2023-06-30T20:00:14+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "Australia expected an Ashes battle but England are gift-wrapping this Test | Geoff Lemon", "description": "<p>England could still snatch victory from a difficult position, but a good team doesn\u2019t get into this position in the first place</p><p>Touring England is supposed to be hard.
