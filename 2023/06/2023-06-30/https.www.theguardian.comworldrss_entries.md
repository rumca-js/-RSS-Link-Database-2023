<p>Foreign Office minister accuses government of ‘apathy’ over issues relating to climate and environment</p><p>Good morning. Rishi Sunak is holding a press conference later to give details of his new NHS long-term workforce plan – one of the biggest policy initiatives of his premiership. He probably wasn’t expecting to be dealing with a resignation today. But <strong>Zac Goldsmith</strong> has just announced he is resigning as a minister at the Foreign Office, saying that he can no longer carry on because of the governnment’s “apathy” on issues relating to climate and the environment.</p><p>In his long resignation letter, posted on Twitter, he says he is “horrified” by how the government has abandoned commitments on animal welfare. He says the UK has “withdrawn our leadership on climate and nature”. And he says that Sunak personally is to blame.</p><p>The problem is not that the government is hostile to the environment, it is that you, our prime minister, are simply uninterested. That signal, or lack of it, has trickled down through Whitehall and caused a kind of paralysis.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/jun/30/zac-goldsmith-resigns-as-minister-blaming-sunak-for-abandoning-global-leadership-role-on-climate-and-nature-uk-politics-live">Continue reading...</a>
