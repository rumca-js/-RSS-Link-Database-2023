For context, after threatening to sue me, Logan Paul promised $1.8 million dollars to the affected victims, saying \"In the meantime, I have committed more than $1.8M for those who do not want to wait for CryptoZoo to be completed.\" However, despite bragging about making millions with Prime, there have been no updates about the status of these updates. \n\nSupport: \n\u25ba Patreon: https://patreon.com/coffeezilla\n\nFollow: \n\u25ba Twitter: @coffeebreak_yt\n\u25ba Instagram: @coffeebreak_yt\n\nCredits:\n3D Artist: Ed Leszczynski @LeszczynskiEd\nVideo Editor: Harry Bagg  @HarryRBagg\nVirtual Production Software: Aximmetry\n\nThis video is an opinion and in no way should be construed as statements of fact. Scams, bad business opportunities, and fake gurus are subjective terms that mean different things to different people. I think someone who promises $100K/month for an upfront fee of $2K is a scam. Others would call it a Napoleon Hill pitch.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYYiypp6WaY", "date_published": "2023-06-30T21:51:49+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
