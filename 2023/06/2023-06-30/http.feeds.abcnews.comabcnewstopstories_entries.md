As swatting incidents around the country increase, the FBI has created a national database to track them, according to new information from the law enforcement agency.

&quot;In response to the national call on swatting, the FBI initiated the Virtual Command Center (VCC) known as the National Common Operation Picture (NCOP),&rdquo; the FBI said in a statement to ABC News.


Swatting, as it is commonly called is when a prank call is placed, usually saying there is some sort of active shooter or immediate dangerous situation, with the hopes to illicit a large police response which often includes the arrival of a SWAT team.

Celebrities like Justin Bieber, Rihanna and Tom Cruise have all been victims of swatting.

The new database is a &quot;collaborative effort between the FBI and law enforcement partners to track and create a real-time picture of swatting incidents,&quot; the FBI says.

Since its inception in May 2023, the database has already tracked 129 swatting incidents around the country.
