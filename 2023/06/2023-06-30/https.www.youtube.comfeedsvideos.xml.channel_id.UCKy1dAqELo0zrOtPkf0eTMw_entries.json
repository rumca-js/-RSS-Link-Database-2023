We see Timothee Chalamet\u2019s Paul Atreides uniting the Fremen of Arrakis and leading a rebellion against the Imperium. We even finally catch a glimpse of Christopher Walken\u2019s character, the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV.\u00a0\n\nBut one thing the trailer makes clear is that Dune: Part Two is no simple war story. This isn\u2019t just a tale of Paul seeking vengeance for the losses he suffered in the first movie. Something has Paul very afraid, and it\u2019s a fear that only grows as the Fremen rally to his cause.\n\nSo what is Paul so afraid of? Why is he so reluctant to become the messiah the Fremen believe him to be? Let's break down the real conflict of the Dune series.\n\nDune: Part Two also stars Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, Dave Bautista, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Zendaya, Charlotte Rampling, Javier Bardem, Austin Butler, Florence Pugh, and L\u00e9a Seydoux.

Also available on PlayStation 4 and Xbox. Narrated by Ronny Barrier.\nCrash Team Rumble may not be a traditional Crash game, but it is a very fun one. Some characters and powers definitely seem to be stronger than others based on the fact that the community brings them into every single match, but everything and everyone is viable in the right hands. Matchmaking is a breeze, the maps are absolutely incredible, there\u2019s a lot of depth for those who want to mine it, and it\u2019s easy to lose yourself in the hunt for Wumpa Fruit for hours at a time, especially if you\u2019re playing with friends. Even the cosmetic upgrades are fun to mess around with. But those hours come to a close a bit too soon due to a lack of game modes, limited matchmaking options, and an unlock system that is often downright annoying. That leaves Crash Team Rumble feeling a lot like Wumpa Fruit itself: it\u2019s a great snack, and it\u2019s got a lot of flavor, but you\u2019ll probably be hungry again 30 minutes later. I know I was.\n\n#IGN", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1nNMGaFMmE", "date_published": "2023-06-30T17:28:50+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Respawn Dev Interview: Creating Catalyst and Inclusivity in Apex Legends", "description": "Catalyst has since become a hugely popular character in Apex and also an LGBTQ+ icon, joining an already-diverse roster list in the game \u2013 something that\u2019s incredibly important to the development team at Respawn.

It also makes good use of its admittedly way-too-large cast of playable characters.
