Finally, Hot Toys announced a new Supergirl figurine inspired by Sasha Calle's appearance in The Flash. But the internet thinks the new figure looks nothing like the actress.

In today's Daily Fix:
After months of scouring the Shire, the One Ring has been found. Yes, the extremely rare, one-of-a-kind Magic the Gathering card has been found and the bounty for it raised to TWO MILLION DOLLARS. Someone is about to be very rich. In other fantasy news, Baldur's Gate 3 has over one hundred hours of cinematics. You're not going to see it all in one playthrough, though, so set aside a few months of your life if you want to 100% that game. And finally, the heroic Game Boy that survived a fire in the First Gulf War will finally get to hang up its combat boots. The iconic handheld that looks like it literally withstood an explosion will be moved from its public display in New York, to its final retirement home in Nintendo of America's headquarters in Washington. We're off until Wednesday next week, have a happy and safe Fourth of July if you're in the U.S.!

## Dune: Part Two - What Is Paul Atreides So Afraid Of?

The new trailer for Dune: Part Two teases some very big conflicts to come in this epic sci-fi franchise. We see Timothee Chalamet’s Paul Atreides uniting the Fremen of Arrakis and leading a rebellion against the Imperium. We even finally catch a glimpse of Christopher Walken’s character, the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV. 

But one thing the trailer makes clear is that Dune: Part Two is no simple war story. This isn’t just a tale of Paul seeking vengeance for the losses he suffered in the first movie. Something has Paul very afraid, and it’s a fear that only grows as the Fremen rally to his cause.

So what is Paul so afraid of? Why is he so reluctant to become the messiah the Fremen believe him to be? Let's break down the real conflict of the Dune series.

Dune: Part Two also stars Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsgård, Dave Bautista, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Zendaya, Charlotte Rampling, Javier Bardem, Austin Butler, Florence Pugh, and Léa Seydoux. The film hits theaters on November 3, 2023.

## Crash Team Rumble Review

Crash Team Rumble reviewed by Will Borger on PlayStation 5. Also available on PlayStation 4 and Xbox. Narrated by Ronny Barrier.
Crash Team Rumble may not be a traditional Crash game, but it is a very fun one. Some characters and powers definitely seem to be stronger than others based on the fact that the community brings them into every single match, but everything and everyone is viable in the right hands. Matchmaking is a breeze, the maps are absolutely incredible, there’s a lot of depth for those who want to mine it, and it’s easy to lose yourself in the hunt for Wumpa Fruit for hours at a time, especially if you’re playing with friends. Even the cosmetic upgrades are fun to mess around with. But those hours come to a close a bit too soon due to a lack of game modes, limited matchmaking options, and an unlock system that is often downright annoying. That leaves Crash Team Rumble feeling a lot like Wumpa Fruit itself: it’s a great snack, and it’s got a lot of flavor, but you’ll probably be hungry again 30 minutes later. I know I was.

It's a debate that's raged for so long that Indiana Jones would probably tell you it belongs in a museum: which of Harrison Ford's two most iconic roles would you rather have come to the rescue? Han Solo and Dr. Jones are among the most popular characters in film history, and Akeem and Joshua have very different takes on which better represents the idea of a "hero."

The Legend of Heroes: Trails into Reverie reviewed by George Yang on PlayStation 5. Also available on PlayStation 4 and PC. 

The Legend of Heroes: Trails into Reverie is one of the best games in this almost 20-year-old franchise and a great RPG. While its overall story is a bit of a retread, its amazing pacing, and in-depth battle system, make it a satisfying conclusion to the Crossbell and Cold Steel arcs. It also makes good use of its admittedly way-too-large cast of playable characters. That said, newcomers who are unfamiliar with the series will certainly be lost without having played the previous games. However, it's well worth doing so in order to experience one of the best RPG universes ever crafted.

Indiana Jones returns in his final(?) adventure Indiana Jones 5, aka Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. Harrison Ford returns as the beloved lead character Indiana Jones, Dial of Destiny being advertised as the conclusion for the character. Could this really be the last Indiana Jones movie, at least for Harrison Ford Indiana Jones? Phoebe Waller-Bridge joins as a young adventure-seeking companion in Dial of Destiny, popping up in many a Lucasfilm released Indiana Jones clip.
Maybe Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade should have been the true ending, but with everything that came along with the Indiana Jones 4 full movie and all it meant, a new ending needed to happen. With Indiana Jones 4 in mind, what could it mean for where Indy stands at the end, and have the Indiana Jones movie clips painted a full picture?
We’re breaking down the ending and how certain things get explained in this last Indiana Jones film here on IGN with host Kim Horcher in this episode of Canon Fodder. We’ve got the meaning of the ending explained, and we’ll even tell you what happened to Mutt– and how what happened to Mutt Williams impacts the rest of it. You may want to forget that part of Indiana Jones (Mutt) but this movie addresses him and all the highs and lows by its end!
