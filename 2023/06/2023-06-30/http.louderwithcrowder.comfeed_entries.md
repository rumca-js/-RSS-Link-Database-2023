And no, it didn't spray all over the Jefferson Memorial before leaving. The -- I guess <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/cnn-porn-hub" target="_blank">adult entertainment site</a> -- would not abide by a new Virginia law calling on porn companies to verify users are eighteen or older.</p><p><a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/pornhub-pulls-out-of-virginia-over-age-verification-law" target="_blank">In a statement</a>, the company claimed that one of its biggest concerns <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/porn-is-it-really-a-bad-habit" target="_blank">is user safety</a>. However: "We believe that the best and most effective solution for protecting children and adults alike is to identify users by their device and allow access to age-restricted materials and websites based on that identification. Until a real solution is offered, we have made the difficult decision to completely disable access to our website in Virginia.”</p><p>When reached for comment, Virginia Governor <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/glenn-youngkin-mask-karen" target="_blank">Glenn Youngkin</a> had this to say.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>Ackshually, through a statement from the governor's office: “The governor remains committed to protecting Virginia’s children from dangerous material on the internet.”</p><p>The law, <a href="https://www.wric.com/news/virginia-news/pornhub-blocks-access-in-virginia-over-new-age-verification-law/" target="_blank">which goes into effect on July 1</a>, requires porn sites to verify users are at least eighteen before they can access porn. Sites are now required to set up a process to verify a user’s age, like providing their identification. Companies that don't could be hit with a civil lawsuit.</p><p>The Free Speech Coalition, which has filed lawsuits in other states, has not decided if they'll sue Virginia yet. The organization feels it's only a matter of time before these laws are overturned on free-speech grounds.</p><p>If you are so deep into the porn game you are angry or upset by Pornhub pulling out, you doubt have already found eleventy other ways to get your porn fix on the internet. You also have hairy palms, poor vision, and are no doubt a real hit with the ladies.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## JK Rowling hater demands she performs a sex act on him, but she ruins his life with a tweet instead

You know how leftist sh*tc*nts get when you express a different opinion on them on the internet. They go right to the -isms and -phobias they accuse you of. In Rowling's case, she also gets people threatening her life. All for the think-crime of, four years ago, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jk-rowling-hbo-series" target="_blank">defending someone who was fired for saying boys are boys and girls are girls</a>.</p><p>If death threats don't phase her, what do you think her putting her mouth on your weiner is going to do?

<p>So how did things escalate this quickly? It starts with Maya Forstater, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/12/18/test-case-rules-against-tax-expert-sacked-transgender-tweet/" target="_blank">the woman who got fired from her job</a> for "'<em>publishing “offensive” tweets questioning government proposals to allow people to self-identify as the opposite sex.'"  </em>Defending this woman is what started Rowling on her road to TERFdom. Forstater had <a href="https://www.forstater.com/discrimination-costs/" target="_blank">just won a settlement</a> when the organisation "was found to have engaged in unlawful discrimination in its decision not to offer her an employment contract or to renew her visiting fellowship."</p><p>Turns out that having a common belief about sex and gender does NOT equal bigotry.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Rowling offered Maya her congratulations.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Which led to Joshua D'silva telling Rowlings to suck his dick. <a href="https://twitter.com/joshuaddsilva/status/1674805987008557058" target="_blank">This WAS the link to the tweet</a>. It was literally deleted while I was working on this post after Rowling informed the world that D'silva allegedly had a penis so small, it was barely detectable. How embarrassing.</p><p>The whole Rowling thing still cracks me up. She is in no way, shape, or form on our side politically AT ALL. When leftists were "resisting" Trump in 2015-16, they would identify themselves as sects from Hogwarts. We would dare them to read another book.</p><p>All it took was one tweet and one single opinion for the left to turn on JK Rowling as if she was literally Voldermort. It's hilarious. Especially knowing Rowling is <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jk-rowling-royalties" target="_blank">sleeping on a giant pile of money</a> as she responds. to each of her haters.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Supreme Court rules AGAINST Joe Biden's unconstitutional student loan bailout, here are some things to know

Joe Biden's unconstitutional student loan bailout has been ruled as such in a 6-3 decision. Thank you once again to Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump for our current Supreme Court. Also, thank you Ruth Bader Ginsburg for having too big of an ego to retire when the time was right.,</p><p>Chief Justice Robert <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/22-506_nmip.pdf" target="_blank">wrote for the majority</a>: "The Secretary asserts that the HEROES Act grants him the authority to cancel $430 billion of student loan principal. It does not. We hold today that the Act allows the Secretary to ‘waive or modify’ existing statutory or regulatory provisions applicable to financial assistance programs under the Education Act, not to rewrite that statute from the ground up.”</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Joe Biden of course knew it was illegal.

<p>That appears to be the memo the journalsimers and news-ish content creators are running with. SCOTUS made people $10,000 poorer. They didn't make me or you or most of the middle class poorer.

<p>As you revel in the leftist meltdowns and cable news misinformation, here are a few things to remember about Biden's (now failed) student loan bailout.</p><h3>The working class would have gotten screwed</h3><br /><p>As the Democrats continue their trend into becoming a <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/07/14/republicans-democrats-hispnanic-voters" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">regional party of coastal elitists</a>, struggling <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/student-loans-paul-begala" target="_self">working-class Americans who DIDN'T take out unaffordable loans</a> for degrees in fields they would never make enough to pay back would have gotten to watch those who did get rewarded. The funny thing is during the rare instances Democrats puts themselves in a position to be challenged on that fact, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elizabeth-warren-student-loan-cancelation" target="_self">they short circuit</a>.</p><h3>Most student loan debt is held by people who have master's degrees or higher</h3><br /><p>Either 56% or close to 60% of student loan debt is held by people with master's degrees. It depends on if you <a href="https://twitchy.com/dougp-3137/2022/05/05/he-really-did-it-christina-pushaws-prediction-on-how-politifact-would-find-a-way-to-rule-this-desantis-statement-false-comes-to-fruition/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">believe Politifact or Ron DeSantis' spokeswoman quoting Politifact</a>.</p><h3>Congresswomen most vocal about student loan forgiveness want their student loans forgiven</h3><br /><p>Congresswoman <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/student-loan-ilhan-omar" target="_self">Ilhan Omar</a>. Congresswoman <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/rashida-tlaib-student-loans" target="_self">Rashida Tlaib</a>. Social media influencer <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/aoc-student-loan-debt" target="_self">Rep. AOC</a>. They all make close to $200k a year, yet say they can't pay off their student loans.</p><h3>Joe Biden's White House aides hold a combined total of $4.7 million in student loan debt</h3><br /><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-19/biden-s-student-loan-quandary-hits-home-for-indebted-top-aides" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Per Bloomberg</a>, "at least 30 senior White House staffers have student loan balances, according to 2021 financial disclosures Bloomberg News obtained from the Office of Government Ethics, including Biden’s new press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, and Bharat Ramamurti, deputy director of the National Economic Council."</p><p>The combined total is $4.7 million. One legislative aide owes "between $500,000 and $1 million." No word on if it's the deputy director of the National Economic Council, whose job it is to advise <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden" target="_self">Joe Biden</a> on economic issues.</p><p>Thus concludes another exciting and successful season of Supreme Court decisions. The next sixteen months of politics will be that much more fun because of it.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Accused rapist gets pulled over for drunk driving, then police discover six kids in the truck he called his "friends"

<p>Gutherie proceeded to fail his field sobriety test in spectacular fashion. He skipped letters H through S while trying to recite the alphabet, and skipped the 50s trying to count down from a hundred. Police had enough information to arrest him for drunk driving and six counts of child abuse (for driving drunk with kids in the car). Parents were notified and picked up their children.</p><p>This is where the story really gets sick. After arrested, Gutherie was charged with raping one of the twelve-year-olds a year earlier. The girl had suffered a miscarriage from all the sexual abuse. How this was discovered was by the girl's grandmother... when Gutherie was caught sliding into the DMs of the victim and her twin sister (who he is also believed to have raped) while he was in jail.</p><p>The grandmother <a href="https://www.krqe.com/news/crime/family-of-victim-says-guthrie-is-messaging-victims-from-behind-bars/" target="_blank">told KRQE News last year</a>:</p><blockquote>“I got a call that they were all in the car. There was six of them that were with this guy, and so, I had no clue,” said the grandma in a phone interview with KRQE News 13.<br /><br />“It makes me sick. I’m livid to what he did to my granddaughters. And he’s just a very, very sick person,” said the grandmother.<br /><br />“I was over where one of my granddaughters was and she told my other granddaughter that he had contacted her,” she said.<br /></blockquote><p>Gutherie is still in jail. I can only hope his cellmates after finding out what he is accused of doing gave him a warm welcome.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

Mulvaney is hurt and upset that no one from Bud Light called to check up on him and/or her depending on which you find more amusing to use at any given moment.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<blockquote>I patiently waited for things to get better, but surprise, they haven’t really. And I was waiting for the brand to reach out to me, but they never did. ... For a company to hire a trans person and then not publicly stand by them is worse than not hiring a trans person at all because it gives customers permission to be as transphobic and as hateful as they want.</blockquote><p>Mulvaney choosing now to respond is a response to Anheuser-Busch CEO Brendan Whitworth breaking his public silence on the brewhaha <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/anheuser-busch-ceo-cbs-mornings" target="_blank">by not addressing the issue and being too big of a pussy to say Dylan's name</a>. Even in responding to Dylan, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12249747/Bud-Light-breaks-silence-wake-Dylan-Mulvaney-accusing-company-not-supporting-her.html" target="_blank">they refused to say "Dylan."</a> In Dylan's defense, it's not like she/him asked for their own can. In Whitworth's defense... tens of b-b-b-BILLIONS of dollars.</p><p>As Bud Light has been forced to choose between customers and that sweet ESG money, Yuengling has taken the opportunity to remind everyone they are America's Beer, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/yuengling-beer-patriotic-can" target="_blank">being the only independently only brewery in America</a>. Turns out, they have a blonde influencer of their own. Golfer Madi Frerking.</p><p>Yuengling didn't sign Madi in response to the Dylan debacle. But much like our friends at Outkick <a href="https://www.outkick.com/yuengling-brings-in-golf-influencer-in-vicious-blow-to-bud-light/" target="_blank">who brought Ms. Frerking to our attention</a>, we here at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website can be <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-exec-bear-market" target="_blank">fratty and out of touch</a> at times.
