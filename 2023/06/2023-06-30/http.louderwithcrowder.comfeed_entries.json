However: \"We believe that the best and most effective solution for protecting children and adults alike is to identify users by their device and allow access to age-restricted materials and websites based on that identification. Until a real solution is offered, we have made the difficult decision to completely disable access to our website in Virginia.\u201d</p><p>When reached for comment, Virginia Governor <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/glenn-youngkin-mask-karen\" target=\"_blank\">Glenn Youngkin</a> had this to say.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"aa488\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=34222616&amp;width=980\" />\n</p>\n<p>Ackshually, through a statement from the governor's office: \u201cThe governor remains committed to protecting Virginia\u2019s children from dangerous material on the internet.\u201d</p><p>The law, <a href=\"https://www.wric.com/news/virginia-news/pornhub-blocks-access-in-virginia-over-new-age-verification-law/\" target=\"_blank\">which goes into effect on July 1</a>, requires porn sites to verify users are at least eighteen before they can access porn. Sites are now required to set up a process to verify a user\u2019s age, like providing their identification. Companies that don't could be hit with a civil lawsuit.</p><p>The Free Speech Coalition, which has filed lawsuits in other states, has not decided if they'll sue Virginia yet. The organization feels it's only a matter of time before these laws are overturned on free-speech grounds.</p><p>If you are so deep into the porn game you are angry or upset by Pornhub pulling out, you doubt have already found eleventy other ways to get your porn fix on the internet.

When leftists were \"resisting\" Trump in 2015-16, they would identify themselves as sects from Hogwarts. We would dare them to read another book.</p><p>All it took was one tweet and one single opinion for the left to turn on JK Rowling as if she was literally Voldermort. It's hilarious.

Dylan Mulvaney vs Madi Frerking in a beer influencer brawl of the ages. Well, the two of them aren't technically \"brawling,\" but I needed an excuse to tie the two stories together. Don't look at me like that. Just crack open a beer and enjoy.</p><p>Titface performer and TikTok ing\u00e9nue Dylan Mulvaney, who is blonde now, has broken them's silence about the Bud Light debacle and costing the company both tens of billions of dollars and its <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-dethroned-beer-america\" target=\"_blank\">title as America's most popular beer</a>. Mulvaney is hurt and upset that no one from Bud Light called to check up on him and/or her depending on which you find more amusing to use at any given moment.</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CatchUpFeed/status/1674622065696202752\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>I patiently waited for things to get better, but surprise, they haven\u2019t really. And I was waiting for the brand to reach out to me, but they never did. ... For a company to hire a trans person and then not publicly stand by them is worse than not hiring a trans person at all because it gives customers permission to be as transphobic and as hateful as they want.</blockquote><p>Mulvaney choosing now to respond is a response to Anheuser-Busch CEO Brendan Whitworth breaking his public silence on the brewhaha <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/anheuser-busch-ceo-cbs-mornings\" target=\"_blank\">by not addressing the issue and being too big of a pussy to say Dylan's name</a>. Even in responding to Dylan, <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12249747/Bud-Light-breaks-silence-wake-Dylan-Mulvaney-accusing-company-not-supporting-her.html\" target=\"_blank\">they refused to say \"Dylan.\"</a> In Dylan's defense, it's not like she/him asked for their own can. In Whitworth's defense... tens of b-b-b-BILLIONS of dollars.</p><p>As Bud Light has been forced to choose between customers and that sweet ESG money, Yuengling has taken the opportunity to remind everyone they are America's Beer, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/yuengling-beer-patriotic-can\" target=\"_blank\">being the only independently only brewery in America</a>. Turns out, they have a blonde influencer of their own. Golfer Madi Frerking.</p><p>Yuengling didn't sign Madi in response to the Dylan debacle. But much like our friends at Outkick <a href=\"https://www.outkick.com/yuengling-brings-in-golf-influencer-in-vicious-blow-to-bud-light/\" target=\"_blank\">who brought Ms. Frerking to our attention</a>, we here at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website can be <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-exec-bear-market\" target=\"_blank\">fratty and out of touch</a> at times.
