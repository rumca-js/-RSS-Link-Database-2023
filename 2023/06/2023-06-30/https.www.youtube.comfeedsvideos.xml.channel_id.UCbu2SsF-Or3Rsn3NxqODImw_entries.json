In fact, there are many games that have been announced and then gone missing in action. Often, this can do more harm than good, and yet it still keeps happening, which begs the question: why? On this episode of Spot On, Tam and Lucy discuss the dangers that can arise when games are announced too early, and why publishers and developers do it regardless.\n\nSpot On is a weekly news show airing Fridays in which GameSpot's managing editor Tamoor Hussain and senior producer Lucy James talk about the latest news in games. Given the highly dynamic and never-ending news cycle of the massive video game industry, there's always something to talk about but, unlike most other news shows, Spot On will dive deep into a single topic as opposed to recapping all the news. Spot On airs each Friday.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAf5tzWIbu0", "date_published": "2023-06-30T20:30:08+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
