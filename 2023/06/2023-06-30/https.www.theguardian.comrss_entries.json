Him and co-star Ella Lily Hyland talk lucky tattoos, Tom Cruise \u2013 and Turner\u2019s weirdest talents</p><p><br />The world of elite sport is made for drama. It\u2019s moneyed and photogenic, buzzing with jeopardy and endlessly sorts people into winners and loser. But Fifteen-Love, the new six-parter starring Aidan Turner and newcomer Ella Lily Hyland, has a very specific dramatic angle: the wild blindspot in the law over the safeguarding of minors. \u201cI\u2019m still baffled by it,\u201d Turner tells me over Zoom from the Cotswolds. \u201cIf you\u2019re a doctor or a carer or a teacher, it\u2019s illegal for you to have a relationship with a person in your care who\u2019s under 18. But there used to be this crazy loophole that it didn\u2019t apply to coaches.\u201d</p><p>This is the backdrop on to which the show projects a drama of multiple, shape-shifting ambiguities \u2013 one which it can be hard to categorise. \u201cWhere do you place the genre of Fifteen-Love?\u201d, Turner asks me. I actually don\u2019t know. I can tell you what it\u2019s about: a young player, Justine (Hyland), making a historical accusation of grooming and sexual assault against her coach, Turner\u2019s character, Glenn. But it <em>is </em>hard to pin down; it starts out like wealth porn, moves into mystery, has political shades but remains carefully ambiguous, both in the he-said/she-said puzzle that drives the plot, and in its tone, which is full of deceptively cheerful interactions \u2013 almost blindfolding the viewer into a darker place. \u201cIt\u2019s usually an easy thing to do with any movie,\u201d Turner continues, \u201cyou dip your toe into it, you know what genre it is, even if it\u2019s opaque, you can imagine where it sits, what demographic, roughly, would watch it. It is strange to send it all into the ether and not know how it will land in the world.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/30/you-can-only-play-romantic-leads-for-so-long-aidan-turner-on-his-deeply-troubling-tennis-drama\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/30/you-can-only-play-romantic-leads-for-so-long-aidan-turner-on-his-deeply-troubling-tennis-drama", "date_published": "2023-06-30T12:00:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "No more slobbing around: men ditch sliders for smart sandals", "description": "<p>Fashion is \u2018growing up again\u2019 and that means summer footwear that suits the swing away from loungewear</p><p>Sporty sliders may be the shoe of choice on Love Island but outside the villa, men are smartening up.</p><p>Retailers report that men are shunning their once loved casual sliders and even Birkenstocks with their supportive footbed for flat leather strappy sandals instead.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jun/30/smart-sandals-men-ditch-sliders\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jun/30/smart-sandals-men-ditch-sliders", "date_published": "2023-06-30T11:58:14+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "NHS radiographers in England vote to strike for first time", "description": "<p>Society of Radiographers members reject pay offer, pushing for deal they say could help cut waiting lists</p><p>Thousands of radiographers in England have voted to go on strike for the first time in the increasingly bitter healthcare pay dispute.</p><p>The Society of Radiographers (SoR) secured sufficient turnout and votes in 43 NHS trusts to go on strike in a ballot that closed on 28 June.

I reminded them that Fo and Rame were recreating a situation in which Giuseppe Pinelli, a Milanese railway worker, was falsely accused of a series of railway-station bombings and mysteriously fell out of a fourth-floor window at police HQ.</p><p>Accidental Death of an Anarchist is at the <a href=\"https://anarchistwestend.com/\">Theatre Royal Haymarket, London</a>, until 9 September</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/30/accidental-death-of-an-anarchist-theatre-documentary\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/30/accidental-death-of-an-anarchist-theatre-documentary", "date_published": "2023-06-30T11:38:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Labour MPs urge Keir Starmer to commit to nationalising water firms", "description": "<p>Exclusive: Thames Water crisis prompts call for rethink on party\u2019s decision to ditch nationalisation policy</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/jun/30/zac-goldsmith-resigns-as-minister-blaming-sunak-for-abandoning-global-leadership-role-on-climate-and-nature-uk-politics-live\">UK politics live \u2013 latest updates</a></li></ul><p>Keir Starmer must consider nationalising water companies, Labour MPs have said, as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/29/what-are-the-options-for-thames-water-as-crisis-talks-continue\">potential collapse of Thames Water</a> means taxpayers may end up footing the bill for its debts.</p><p>Last year the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/labour-will-not-nationalise-water-energy-or-rail-says-rachel-reeves_uk_62de4d15e4b0aad58d1c8b98\">ditched the Labour party\u2019s policy to nationalise water</a>, saying: \u201cWithin our fiscal rules, to be spending billions of pounds on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/02/water-renationalised-without-compensation-activists-shareholders-england\">nationalising things</a>, that just doesn\u2019t stack up against our fiscal rules.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/30/labour-mps-urge-keir-starmer-to-commit-to-nationalising-thames-water\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/30/labour-mps-urge-keir-starmer-to-commit-to-nationalising-thames-water", "date_published": "2023-06-30T11:31:49+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Easy, breezy chic: the viral fans and high-tech fabrics helping you keep your cool", "description": "<p>Everyone from Demi Moore to the Beckhams are looking for stylish ways to beat a heatwave </p><p><strong>\u2022 <a href=\"https://ablink.editorial.theguardian.com/ss/c/TBl-lE0k4WbTlFRn6v-lQXxTpTslqnvUsR2ofAkC00sFk0L9aJTJrdjHU0ExJtk6WDMa8WjDoNsahBLoE5d-Gqi3vdRF30ji7vrFZHdsaeJXvnKFCtkqpJ59jsUrpePsSBONuXS7EA2LpcGUtnwSTA83hoE-PIVklR9Xi2sYwDlzXDDI8_jpQoZEpo4WWxGtP-sX9l3EtFikUrOyiuxJ7kIc9ocjnkmmsE0pw1gso255k7LtaIVM_onDBi5nPZVOgkSrx6HEIWMIl48vNQ5r4Zy85g8FvDUwgjVMxJwVnXfRZxuzondospW2VZRbJl1QvqK4YVqIIRvK74mrHFQNTg/3w3/qSORL3CsQxW-zpLzJvTqrg/h42/DkqMc0A_WrmJENttsJKEBv3yEBvrSjQ2FXNZdCwhpoQ\">Don\u2019t get Fashion Statement delivered to your inbox?

Or after enjoying Westminster Abbey and so on, especially if you\u2019re staying in one of the numerous fancy and not-so-fancy hotels around the St James\u2019 Park area.

It\u2019s \u201cblack as a hole and [moves] like liquid\u201d, and those who see it take it as a bad harbinger. Who can blame them for suspecting the supernatural, when their city\u2019s been turned upside down? Although there\u2019s a more mundane explanation \u2013 the panther has escaped from the menagerie of the Jardin des Plantes \u2013 it\u2019s emblematic of an extraordinary and terrible year. Stef Penney\u2019s fourth novel opens in May 1870, just before the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian war. It chronicles the siege of Paris \u2013 four months of shellfire and starvation \u2013 and even then is only halfway done. After the French defeat in January 1871, Paris is far from peaceful: revolution follows, and the radical Paris Commune takes control of the city until its violent defeat in May 1871. To cram all these events into one novel is ambitious, but the result is electrifying.</p><p>Admittedly, things start slowly. The novel roves among Parisians who have little inkling of what the year will hold. Ellis Butterfield, dissolute nephew of the American ambassador, dabbles in poetry and struggles to repress his experiences as a surgeon in the American civil war. The Lamy family \u2013 whose photography business marks them out as only semi-respectable, even without the erotic shots that pay their bills \u2013 have ambitions for their daughter\u2019s marriage, while their Canadian assistant Lawrence Harper tentatively circles a romance with another man. The most immediately arresting of this cast is Anne Petitjean, Creole inmate of the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re asylum, who is obliged to be hypnotised on stage by her physician, and who harbours a passionate fascination for the tiger in the nearby menagerie.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/30/the-beasts-of-paris-by-stef-penney-review-radicals-and-romantics\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/30/the-beasts-of-paris-by-stef-penney-review-radicals-and-romantics", "date_published": "2023-06-30T06:30:36+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Smoke on the water, and music in the air: the magic of Montreux, Switzerland", "description": "<p>The town\u2019s fabled music festival is just one side of a place that is framed by natural beauty to hike through \u2013 and wine heritage you can savour</p><p>My aunt Carol, an enthusiastic traveller and music lover, was driving back to the UK from the Algarve in her veteran campervan when she decided, on a whim, to swing right near Lyon and make for the Montreux jazz festival on the shores of Lake Geneva (Lac L\u00e9man).</p><p>This was 1987 and travel was still analogue.
