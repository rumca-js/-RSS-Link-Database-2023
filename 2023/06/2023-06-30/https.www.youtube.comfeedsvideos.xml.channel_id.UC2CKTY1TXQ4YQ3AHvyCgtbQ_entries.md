So everything's out and available for download for Warhammer 40,000 Combat Patrol now - what to do I REALLY think about it?

Vince Venturella and I made another game! Check out MAJESTIC 13 at http://www.majestic13game.com

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
