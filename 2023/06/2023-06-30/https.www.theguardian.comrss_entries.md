The crimes, which include bribery, theft, carjacking, bigamy and timber larceny, have remained largely the same since then; Mississippi voters amended it remove burglary in 1950 and added murder and rape in 1968.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2023/jun/30/us-supreme-court-mississippi-voting-rights-case-black-voters">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Orange Tree theatre, London<br /></strong>The intricately tangled lives of three women, and their explosive secret, are revealed in this complicated picture of queer love across the decades</p><p>The wonder of Isley Lynn’s gorgeous play about the love between three women is in its connections. In a time-hopping narrative spanning 28 years, we meet Bel, Annie and Flo at two different points during their changing intimate relationship, with different actors playing the older and younger versions of each character. The past and present bleed together fluidly and beautifully as The Swell expands into a complicated drawing of modern queer love across the decades.</p><p>In the earlier story Bel and Annie are engaged after a whirlwind romance but when Annie’s childhood friend Flo – a volcano of fun, trouble and life – comes to visit, the ease of their new bond is uprooted. In the later thread, Flo and Bel live in an isolated home, away from everything and everyone else. But how did they get there? From the start we’re eager to know, but Lynn keeps the mystery of these adjoining stories devilishly held back, until suddenly the secrets of The Swell explode.</p><p>At the <a href="https://orangetreetheatre.co.uk/whats-on/the-swell">Orange Tree theatre, London</a>, until 7 July</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/30/the-swell-review-orange-tree-theatre-london">Continue reading...</a>

## England’s men of Bazball are putting fun before winning. Why not try both? | Jonathan Liew

<p>Ben Stokes’ side could be forgiven for their unwavering commitment to Bazball if it meant winning 10 out of 11 Tests</p><p>And frankly, is this not what the people want? Australia may be on the verge of going 2-0 up after enduring the worst of the conditions, the loss of their champion spinner and an out-of-form No 3 batter. But these are mere details, and the men of Bazball do not trouble themselves with details. Could they have gone harder? Could they have lost their wickets in even more perplexing ways? Could they have thrilled us even more? When cornered, don’t back down. Double down.</p><p>For all the wildness and weirdness of the darkening evening, this Test turned on the slapstick of the morning session, when England resumed with a slight advantage on 278 for four and were dismissed just 15 overs later. There is a school of thought out there that if you appreciated England’s style of cricket when they were winning, then it is unfair to criticise it when it fails to come off. This is a little bit like arguing that if you have ever enjoyed a meal at a restaurant, you are not entitled to complain when they give you E. coli on your next visit. It’s just the way they cook. They’re taking a whole new approach to gastronomy. And ultimately, when you get down to it, is there really any difference between fine dining and violent diarrhoea?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jun/30/englands-new-fun-style-is-admirable-but-maybe-try-winning-ashes-cricket">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The government has finally accepted responsibility for staff. But years of neglect have harmed patients as well</p><p>These are the worst of times for the NHS in England. Public satisfaction is at its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/mar/29/satisfaction-with-the-nhs-plummets-to-lowest-level-in-40-years" title="">lowest level</a> since it started to be measured 40 years ago. Staff morale is shattered, with retention a growing problem. Currently there are more than 112,000 vacancies in a workforce of <a href="https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/audio-video/key-facts-figures-nhs" title="">1.26 million full-time equivalents</a>. Waiting lists have reached record levels. Against this alarming backdrop – particularly for anyone in need of treatment – the workforce plan launched by the prime minister on Friday is welcome as well as overdue. But it should not be mistaken for a solution.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/nhs-long-term-workforce-plan/" title="">plan</a>, which includes a promise to spend £2.4bn over five years, is the fulfilment of a pledge made by Jeremy Hunt when he was the health secretary in 2017. The need for a strategy to train enough staff to care for an ageing population was clear then. But centralised workforce planning does not sit well with a Conservative party that trusts markets over public administrators. Repeatedly, and in the face of a mounting crisis, ministers refused to act.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/30/the-guardian-view-on-the-nhs-this-workforce-plan-is-years-late">Continue reading...</a>

One of the film’s themes, spread over two hours of dazzling artwork, is how identity is a constant negotiation of race, class, nationality and gender.</p><p>The movie is also rewriting the script in Hollywood. First, it entrenches animation as a coming cinematic form – expanding beyond studios such as the child-friendly <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/feature/best-animated-movies-21st-century-pixar-studio-ghibli-1201895863/" title="">Pixar and the ethereal output of Studio Ghibli</a>. Guillermo del Toro’s remake of Pinocchio as a dark animated musical won this year’s Oscar. The Mexican director was so taken with the technique that he declared in <a href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/guillermo-del-toro-only-wants-to-do-animation/" title="">June</a>: “I only want to do animation.” Across the Spider-Verse is also a testament to the democratisation of film-making; among the 1,000 people who contributed was a 14-year-old whose animated <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/07/movies/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-lego.html" title="">Lego characters</a> made it into the final cut.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/30/the-guardian-view-on-spider-mans-multiverse-it-is-wokeness-in-action">Continue reading...</a>

<ul><li>Yasir Al-Rumayyan ponders extra Australian and Korean events</li><li>LIV golfers reluctant to return to PGA Tour competition</li></ul><p>A number of LIV Golf’s leading players have made it clear to Yasir al-Rumayyan, the governor of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, that they have no interest in returning to regularly compete on the PGA Tour. Al-Rumayyan has made a commitment to those featuring in this week’s $25m (£21m) LIV event in Valderrama that it is full steam ahead with plans for 2024.</p><p>Al-Rumayyan promised LIV expansion plans during conversations with players on Thursday evening. The sense that LIV will wither on the vine has been comprehensively contradicted by the mood in southern Spain. After a successful tournament in Adelaide this year, LIV is giving strong consideration to a second stop in Australia in 2024. A first visit to Korea is also a serious option.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/30/liv-players-give-pga-tour-cold-shoulder-as-saudis-plan-further-expansion">Continue reading...</a>

When my 13-year-old daughter got into county netball last year, the girls were divided into three groups, practising at three different sports centres. My daughter was placed in the group furthest away from where we live, without any discussion about whether we could get her there. The session was an hour’s drive from our home and started at 6pm every Monday. This despite the fact that another one of the groups practises only 15 minutes away from home. No one encouraged lift-sharing or stopped to find out whether parents could facilitate these sessions.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/30/a-level-playing-field-for-cricket-is-a-long-way-off">Continue reading...</a>

I work for a small charity focused on boosting people’s health and wellbeing through access to outdoor spaces and activities.

The majority of our local families live in flats, and the schools nearby have limited space for children to play.</p><p>This, coupled with the rising cost of living, means that just giving a new activity a go can be a struggle, and if you want to pursue a sport, the effort required can add a huge amount of pressure.

HBO’s sleazy music industry satire about unhappy pop star Jocelyn (Lily-Rose Depp) falling under the spell of ludicrously creepy wannabe manager Tedros Tedros (Abel “the Weeknd” Tesfaye, who co-created the show with Euphoria showrunner Sam Levinson) is so bad it’s bad: a lurid miasma of grim titillation, saggy plotting, tonal confusion (let’s just say cringe comedy and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/14/nauseating-hateful-tv-how-the-idol-has-single-handedly-resurrected-torture-porn">graphic abuse</a> are not natural bedfellows) and retina-searingly incessant displays of Depp’s underboob.</p><p>Yet if you have persevered with The Idol for whatever reason (sadomasochism?), you will have received an unexpected gift: a maddeningly persistent but seductively seedy earworm called World Class Sinner/I’m a Freak, the track that Jocelyn’s label are pushing as her comeback single in the show and that, in reality, is now being touted as a prospective summer anthem, having clocked up 11m Spotify streams over the past few weeks. Although Jocelyn is fictional, the track – which is both an arch collage of bad-girl tropes delivered with amusingly flat disaffection, and a shimmering dance-pop banger – very much isn’t. Credited to Depp, it was released on the first of five separate EPs – one for each corresponding episode (the series concludes on Sunday) – that together form an original, music-only version of The Idol’s OST.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/30/the-idol-vol-1-review-soundtrack-hbo-show-wkend">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>St Luke’s, Glasgow</strong><br />In the first concert by a 13-strong Scottish string ensemble aiming to reach fresh audiences, Bartók’s Divertimento for String Orchestra was delivered with rare gusto and warmth</p><p>Thirteen North are a new Scottish-based string ensemble with an almost entirely female lineup of 13, under the shared artistic directorship of violinists Emily Davis and Catriona Price. Conceived by the pair during the Covid lockdowns, the group aim “to bring classical music to new and more diverse audiences”, and gave their debut concert in a deconsecrated church that also hosts rock and pop gigs, with the audience encouraged to move around and the bar remaining open for hazy IPAs throughout.</p><p>Under the title Connected, the programme was billed as “a multidimensional performance … exploring human connection through the themes of generations, culture and tradition.” It centred on Béla Bartók’s Divertimento for String Orchestra, which was performed with a rare gusto, alongside commissions from Pippa Murphy, Pàdruig Morrison and Price herself. These were interpolated between Bartók’s three movements, and prefaced with short films by Glasgow film-maker Bircan Birol. Beautifully shot on locations around Scotland, they allowed each composer to speak in their own words, conveying the new pieces’ hinterlands more evocatively than printed programme notes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/30/thirteen-north-review-st-lukes-glasgow">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In films ranging from Catch-22 to Little Miss Sunshine, Arkin was renowned for the technical virtuosity he brought to each role of his colossal career</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/30/alan-arkin-oscar-winning-actor-little-miss-sunshine-dies-aged-89">Alan Arkin, Oscar winning actor in Little Miss Sunshine, dies aged 89</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2023/jun/30/alan-arkin-a-life-in-pictures">Alan Arkin: a life in pictures</a></li></ul><p>Tough, unsentimental, witty, gravel-voiced and bullet-headed, Alan Arkin was a wiry character actor and comic presence who had a colossal career on stage, TV and movies. He came from the era of male stars such as Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon, Ben Gazzara, Robert Duvall and Peter Falk – actors who projected a kind of take-it-or-leave-it pugnacity, integrity and strength. The always sympathetic and technically brilliant Arkin perhaps came into his own late in life, his face and shaven head morphing into a black-comic skull of derision and hilarity as the outrageous old guy who says what he wants because he’s decided he doesn’t care any more what people think … that’s if he ever did care.</p><p>In 2006, Arkin won the best supporting actor Academy Award for the part of Edwin Hoover, the chaotic old grandpa with the no-bullshit honesty in Little Miss Sunshine. Edwin is part of a bizarre dysfunctional extended family who hit the road in a VW van to get his little granddaughter Olive (played by Abigail Breslin) from New Mexico to California, where she will compete in a junior beauty pageant in questionable taste called “Little Miss Sunshine”.

<p><strong>Aviva Studios, Manchester<br /></strong>The 94-year-old Japanese trailblazer goes big – <em>really</em> big – with warehouse-filling inflatables of dolls, pumpkins and writhing tentacles instilling satisfaction and a stupid happiness </p><p>Clearly the architects didn’t get the message that Manchester’s new arts venue Factory International has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/29/manchester-mixed-reaction-aviva-studios-naming-deal">renamed, boringly, as Aviva Studios</a>. Because despite the new moniker I can still picture its ultimate inspiration, Tony Wilson, regional TV reporter and founder of the city’s legendary Factory Records, standing on the raised viewing platform in its colossal space, the Warehouse, pretending to be Andy Warhol, looking down on tiny people dwarfed by multicoloured inflatable artworks, pleased that Manchester has finally turned into his fantasy version of Warhol’s New York.</p><p>The Warehouse is a monster of a room that seems to have been inspired by staring at the enigmatic covers of Factory Records LPs while listening to Joy Division. It is an enormous industrial cavern with giant steel doors and towering, shadowy dimensions that appears equally capable of hosting art, gigs or a club. Yayoi Kusama’s opening event You, Me and the Balloons has aspects of all three. The 94-year-old pink-haired artist appears on a screen chanting above a forest of luminous purple tentacles. In front of this loom a<em> </em>gargantuan orange pumpkin, a giant statue that resembles Kusama with a skirt made of fat fingers, yapping dogs and lurid clouds.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/30/yayoi-kusama-balloons-review-aviva-studios-manchester">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The former Australian quick rang the bell before play on Friday, stirring memories of his feisty visits to Lord’s as a player</p><p>The sight of Merv Hughes, that magnificent trademark moustache now as pale as his old cricket whites, ringing the bell before play might have served as something of an inspiration for an Australia team struggling to deal with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/29/it-didnt-look-good-australia-sweat-on-fitness-of-nathan-lyon-for-rest-of-ashes">loss through injury of a key bowler</a>.</p><p>It was during the second Ashes Test on this very ground 30 years ago that Australia’s Craig McDermott was taken to hospital in agony with suspected appendicitis, later diagnosed as a twisted bowel, and ruled out of the game and the series. Hughes led the attack as Australia were forced to play on without one of their key bowlers – Mark Waugh shared the new ball – but they won handsomely all the same (it did help, to be fair, that after winning the toss their top four batters scored 111, 152, 164 not out and 99, and they defended the resulting score of 632 for four declared with an innings and 62 runs to spare).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/30/ashes-diary-merv-hughes-returns-politely-to-scene-of-famous-sledges">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Cool down with these refreshing cocktails, with or without alcohol: a peppery vodka-grapefruit pick-me-up; a rosemary-scented G&amp;T; a limey kombucha mojito; a white rum twist on the dark and stormy; peach juice and fizz with lavender; and a salty, spicy, beer-and-lime livener</p><p>When the sun is high and the Ashes are in full swing, I become less interested in martinis, negronis and other short intensities; instead, I want long, cold refreshment. Here are a few of my summer favourites. Each is highly adaptable – try ginger ale for the mojito, mint syrup in the gin and tonic, and so on – but the non-negotiables are that the ingredients (and, ideally, the glass) should be <em>very</em> cold and an excess of ice is almost always the way to go: the more you use, the colder everything stays and the slower the ice melts.</p><p>If you prefer your cocktails alcohol-free, there are so many spirits and beers to suit these days: <a href="https://calenodrinks.com/product/dark-spicy">Caleño’s Dark &amp; Spicy</a>, for instance, works beautifully in the dark and stormy, <a href="https://www.seedlipdrinks.com/en-us/shop/seedlip-garden-108/">Seedlip’s Garden 108</a> makes a very happy-making G&amp;T and <a href="https://www.strykk.com/collections/all-products/products/not-vodka?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=10313150626&amp;utm_content=109539705304&amp;utm_term=strykk%20vodka&amp;gad=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwpuajBhBpEiwA_ZtfhXm4WRyJyjl0bYl-aC2SQm2jw3ZDjQ7NkCqK8wG7TDLqGjlF_932fBoCLJAQAvD_BwE">Strykk’s Not V*dka</a> works really well in the Dalmatian; and while <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/jun/04/hoppy-days-our-pick-of-the-best-no-and-low-alcohol-beers-and-ales">alcohol-free beer </a>was mostly carwash just a few short years ago, there are any number of exceptional ones now widely available.</p><p>Mark Diacono’s latest book, Spice: A Cook’s Companion, is published by Quadrille at £25.

I like pairing them with something creamy such as a custard. Here, a good dollop of pistachio paste adds a gentle nuttiness that doesn’t overwhelm the fruit.

## ‘Domestic abuse isn’t your business? Yes it is’: the push for employers to do more to protect their staff

<p>More and more companies recognise they need to look after their staff’s mental health. But survivors of domestic violence want to extend that duty of care<br /></p><p>At 5.30pm on 4 November 2015, Sharon Livermore left the office of the recruitment firm where she worked in rural Cambridgeshire and walked across the dark car park to her hatchback. The end of a long, hard day – in fact, several long, hard years – was in sight, and she was beginning to allow herself to feel relieved. Over her lunch break, Livermore had applied for a non-molestation order to stop her estranged husband contacting her. She had reported him to police the previous week after years of severe physical and psychological abuse; he had been arrested and bailed, and Livermore thought the order would mean she never had to see or speak to him ever again. She now views this belief as naive: the assumption of someone who, despite everything, “didn’t really know anything about domestic abuse”.</p><p>When Livermore got in her car and turned on the engine, she noticed the windows were clouded by condensation. This struck her as odd; the vehicle had been empty for hours. Briefly, she panicked that her ex was in the car, but when she looked over her shoulder, there was no one there. Livermore gave herself a shake. Exhaustion and stress must be making her paranoid. And then she smelled aftershave.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/30/domestic-abuse-support-in-the-workplace">Continue reading...</a>

You know the ones. Not the weirdly suggestive ones trying to get you to download some crap free-to-play mobile game.

Like a cage for barbecuing vegetables. A watch that doubles as a miniature air fryer. This one was for a tiny inkless printer you can use to print stuff from your phone and turn it into stickers.</p><p>People my age had this 42 years ago, though. Only back then it was the most derided peripheral ever: the Sinclair ZX Printer for the ZX Spectrum. My mother brought both machine and printer home in 1982, proclaiming that we would now be able to do word processing and write books like the families in the posh part of town.

<p>Kay Dick’s novel They was almost forgotten – but its dark predictions are eerily prescient. Perfect fodder for Peake and her new company to bring to life in Manchester</p><p>In the dead of night, books are slipped from shelves. Scores are stolen and paintings removed. Any artist who creates “beyond the accepted limit” is punished: painters blinded, musicians deafened, each one robbed of the sense they rely on most for their work. This is the world, tucked into the Sussex coast, that Kay Dick imagines in They. First published in 1977 it was, until very recently, largely ignored. Newly republished, and soon to be staged, this rural English dystopia outlines the bone-deep urge to create.</p><p>“It takes a lot to dull that impulse,” says Sarah Frankcom, former director of Manchester’s Royal Exchange and the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (Lamda). In a rehearsal room in central London, empty but for a paper-strewn table, the director sits with actor Maxine Peake and movement director Imogen Knight. Together they are transforming Dick’s nightmarish tale into a live show. It is to be the inaugural performance of their new company, Maat (Music, Art, Activism and Theatre), one that holds art and activism at its heart.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/30/maxine-peake-sarah-frankcom-imogen-knight-interview-they">Continue reading...</a>

<p>While I couldn’t get out of mum mode at Glastonbury, it reminded me all children need to go feral now and again</p><p>Every festival season, I think about something the writer Nell Frizzell once said to me during an interview about being the child of hippies and being taken to Womad<strong>, </strong>the international arts festival. She described it as “standing in a field next to your dad wearing a bumbag, and thinking, ‘Oh, I’ve seen enough men from Kazakhstan playing fiddles.’” It never fails to make me laugh, because not only have I lived that experience (though it was my mum who took me to Womad), but because it comically captures that feeling of your parents dragging you along to something that they insist you’ll love when, really, you’re there because they want to be.</p><p>I’m still recovering from Glastonbury – my first trip away from my son, and, it turns out, the perfect choice for that purpose, because there was so much going on that I couldn’t focus on worrying about the distance between us. And it turns out that parenthood prepares you well for the chaos and squalor: could I handle very little sleep and quite a lot of exposure to human faeces? Absolutely. Am I inured to unpredictable behaviour, strange meals at odd hours and weird bursts of overwhelming emotion? Also, yes.</p><p>Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/30/hippie-parent-festival-mum-glastonbury-children">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The trailer for Retribution has been released.

Instead – and I really urge you to do the same thing – I like to view every new film he makes as simply the latest episode of a long-running series about a hapless man called Liam Neeson who just absolutely stinks at looking after his children for a single day without any of them being plunged into mortal danger.</p><p>The series starts with Liam Neeson’s daughter getting kidnapped (Taken), before his wife gets kidnapped (Taken 2), he’s falsely accused of murder (Taken 3), he’s trapped on a plane where people die every 20 minutes (Non-Stop), his son is killed (Cold Pursuit), and then he visits the arctic for a nice relaxing break, only to end up being forced into a situation where he has to murder a bunch of wolves with some bottles taped to his fists (The Grey).

## ‘You can only play romantic leads for so long’: Aidan Turner on his deeply troubling tennis drama

<p>Intense psychological drama Fifteen-Love sees the former Poldark play a top coach accused of abuse. Him and co-star Ella Lily Hyland talk lucky tattoos, Tom Cruise – and Turner’s weirdest talents</p><p><br />The world of elite sport is made for drama. It’s moneyed and photogenic, buzzing with jeopardy and endlessly sorts people into winners and loser. But Fifteen-Love, the new six-parter starring Aidan Turner and newcomer Ella Lily Hyland, has a very specific dramatic angle: the wild blindspot in the law over the safeguarding of minors. “I’m still baffled by it,” Turner tells me over Zoom from the Cotswolds. “If you’re a doctor or a carer or a teacher, it’s illegal for you to have a relationship with a person in your care who’s under 18. But there used to be this crazy loophole that it didn’t apply to coaches.”</p><p>This is the backdrop on to which the show projects a drama of multiple, shape-shifting ambiguities – one which it can be hard to categorise. “Where do you place the genre of Fifteen-Love?”, Turner asks me. I actually don’t know. I can tell you what it’s about: a young player, Justine (Hyland), making a historical accusation of grooming and sexual assault against her coach, Turner’s character, Glenn. But it <em>is </em>hard to pin down; it starts out like wealth porn, moves into mystery, has political shades but remains carefully ambiguous, both in the he-said/she-said puzzle that drives the plot, and in its tone, which is full of deceptively cheerful interactions – almost blindfolding the viewer into a darker place. “It’s usually an easy thing to do with any movie,” Turner continues, “you dip your toe into it, you know what genre it is, even if it’s opaque, you can imagine where it sits, what demographic, roughly, would watch it. It is strange to send it all into the ether and not know how it will land in the world.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/30/you-can-only-play-romantic-leads-for-so-long-aidan-turner-on-his-deeply-troubling-tennis-drama">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Return of Dario Fo and Franca Rame’s political farce begs a question: can theatre ever be as potent as documentary?</p><p>There is a fascinating role reversal going on in London theatre. Behind the elegant Corinthian facade of the Theatre Royal Haymarket, an ebullient satire on police corruption, Accidental Death of an Anarchist, has arrived by way of the Sheffield Crucible and the Lyric Hammersmith. Meanwhile Somerset Maugham’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/may/07/the-circle-review-orange-tree-somerset-maugham-jane-asher">The Circle</a>, a Haymarket staple over the last century, has just enjoyed a triumphant revival at the off-West End venue of the Orange Tree, Richmond. Delighted as I am at the switch that puts political theatre in the commercial heartland, I came out of the Haymarket pondering how best to arouse an audience to a state of savage indignation.</p><p>The latest very amusing Accidental Death is a new adaptation by Tom Basden of a popular 1970 classic by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/oct/13/dario-fo-obituary">Dario Fo</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/may/29/franca-rame">Franca Rame</a> about the defenestration of a man in police custody. The story has been anglicised and updated but, since there is no reference in the programme to the historical case on which it is based, the young couple next to me understandably took it to be pure fiction. I reminded them that Fo and Rame were recreating a situation in which Giuseppe Pinelli, a Milanese railway worker, was falsely accused of a series of railway-station bombings and mysteriously fell out of a fourth-floor window at police HQ.</p><p>Accidental Death of an Anarchist is at the <a href="https://anarchistwestend.com/">Theatre Royal Haymarket, London</a>, until 9 September</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/30/accidental-death-of-an-anarchist-theatre-documentary">Continue reading...</a>

The six-year-deal that Kane signed in 2018 was always the ace in Tottenham CEO Daniel Levy’s pack, but as that enters its final year holding on grimly to the club’s prized asset, their best player since Gareth Bale was cashed out a decade ago, becomes less viable. Interest from Bayern Munich, willing to pay £80m to buy a striker to replace Robert Lewandowski and admired by coach Thomas Tuchel, at least prevents Kane flourishing at a Premier League rival. Kane is said to be keen but Levy is not known for taking big decisions at anyone’s pace but his own.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/30/from-harry-kane-to-victor-osimhen-summer-transfer-sagas">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For the NHS to survive the next 75 years it needs radical change – led by clinicians and validated by patients, not imposed by politicians</p><p>We love the NHS because we value the concepts of equality of care and equity of access.

The people in the service – medics, nurses, physiotherapists, dieticians, pharmacists, occupational therapists – are all routinely involved in a multidisciplinary approach to caring. Not many countries come close to this. We could have a health service that is internationally acknowledged as excellent, given a concerted effort. But change needs to be devised by clinicians, validated by patients, and facilitated by politicians and administrators – rather than the failed model of change devised by politicians and imposed on staff and patients.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/30/what-next-for-the-nhs-six-ways-to-secure-its-future">Continue reading...</a>

## House of Ming, London SW1: ‘Is £28 for a plate of king prawns with string beans reasonable?’ – restaurant review

<p>The interior designers have clearly thought much longer about the place than anyone involved with the menu</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.houseofming.co.uk/en/">House of Ming</a>, an opulent Chinese restaurant with branches worldwide, was established in India in 1978 and has now opened close to Buckingham Palace in London. This is incredibly handy should you need feeding after a long stint of watching people in tiaras wave at you from balconies. Or after enjoying Westminster Abbey and so on, especially if you’re staying in one of the numerous fancy and not-so-fancy hotels around the St James’ Park area. Millions do each year, and feeding them is big business, which is why opening a House of Ming in the <a href="https://www.tajhotels.com/en-in/destination/hotels-in-london/">Taj hotel</a> makes perfect sense. House of Ming markets itself as luxurious, in much the same vein as <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/reveller/restaurants/grace-dent-reviews-hutong-at-the-shard-8687974.html">Hutong at the Shard</a> does, or the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/may/13/tattu-london-wc2-restaurant-review">boldly bizarre Tattu off Shaftesbury Avenue</a>. House of Ming’s shtick is not earnestly recreated, authentic Cantonese and Sichuan food, but more catch-all Chinese food, in this case by way of India and now transplanted to London. Come and be wowed, it seems to say. Come and experience the fantasy, the decadence, the splendour …</p><p>The <a href="https://www.atelierwren.com/">interior designers Atelier Wren</a> have clearly thought much longer about the place than anyone involved with the menu, creating a space inspired, they say, by the Ming Dynasty, with hand-painted ceilings, lush, velvet booths, red lacquer, green hues, plush golden “love seats” for two, pretty brass pendant lights and elegant group dining rooms. All very well, unless you’re a solo diner, as I was, on an un-busy weekday lunchtime, when they dispatched me to an unlovely corner, where I was seated looking at the toilet door, the Epos till system and the area where they leave the dirty plates. I ordered a bottle of sparkling water – twice. The first one never materialised, and the second they insisted on serving formally, possibly to remind me that I’m in a “posh place”, but then the service dried up, so I just resigned myself to being thirsty and consoled myself with the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1jYYAtEmIT1GlPoobIMRv5?si=420d765406ac49c6&amp;nd=1">“Summer Daytime” Spotify playlist</a> made specially for them by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/gok-wan">Gok Wan</a>.

## After 44 years, Labour is expelling me. And my MP and activist friends are asking: who will be next? | Neal Lawson

<p>There seem to be bullies at the top who don’t understand pluralism. They see only true believers and sworn enemies</p><p>Last Friday an email from the Labour party – of which I’ve been a member for 44 years – broke my political heart. They wrote coldly to tell me that back in May 2021, I’d committed a crime: retweeting a Lib Dem MP’s call for some voters to back Green candidates in local elections, accompanied by my suggestion that such cross-party cooperation represented “grownup progressive politics”. My punishment? Expulsion.</p><p>Why did I say that, why on earth am I being expelled for it, and what might it mean for the future of our politics? I said it for two reasons. First, because the progressive majority in our country is thwarted by the electoral system. Votes on the right go almost exclusively to the Tories, but the progressive vote is always split between Labour, Lib Dems and Greens. Under first past the post (FPTP) the Conservatives win on a minority of the vote, again and again. Cooperation between progressives just makes sense.</p><p>Neal Lawson is director of the cross-party campaign organisation <a href="https://www.compassonline.org.uk/">Compass</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/30/labour-expelling-mp-activist-neal-lawson">Continue reading...</a>

The pair will make their first foray into the DC Universe in head honcho James Gunn’s Superman Legacy, due out in 2025, replacing previous incumbents Henry Cavill and Amy Adams.</p><p>Corenswet is best known for a supporting role in the Ryan Murphy series The Politician, while Brosnahan is the better-known of the pair, having brilliantly headlined five remarkable seasons of the Amazon Prime stalwart The Marvellous Mrs Maisel.

My parents bought this for me when I was eight and doing dismally in school, one red-leatherette volume for each gold-embossed letter of the alphabet.

## The video game that made me feel seen as a trans person | Ceridwen Millington

<p>2020’s Tell Me Why from French studio Don’t Nod remains the best trans story in games – and we could use more of them</p><p>Now is the perfect time to play 2020’s story-driven adventure game <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/sep/14/tell-me-why-game-review-a-poetic-exploration-of-memory-against-a-stunning-alaskan-landscape">Tell Me Why</a>: in honour of Pride month, it’s currently free to download. Developer Don’t Nod’s tale follows a trans man returning to his childhood home and confronting his family’s past. A major video game that centres any trans character is a rarity to celebrate, but Tyler Ronan doesn’t feel tokenistic; he is part of a mature and complex story. Tell Me Why feels like a necessary counterbalance to a wider climate that seems desperate to make gender-diverse people feel marginalised and forgotten.</p><p>Tyler, a trans man, and his twin cisgender sister, Alyson, spend much of the game exploring the mysteries behind their mother’s death. Mental health and the fallibility of memory take equal weight, as the game explores transphobia and belonging. As a trans woman, I found the narrative compelling, challenging and deeply affecting. I was drawn in by its representation of trans people, but my attention was held by its musings on the universal concerns we all have. In other words, I was moved by its confidence in showing that trans lives are as complex as anyone else’s.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jun/30/video-game-trans-person-tell-me-why">Continue reading...</a>

## The Beasts of Paris by Stef Penney review – wildly energetic tale of revolution

<p>The horror and hedonism of the siege of Paris are dazzlingly evoked in a gripping novel of self-discovery</p><p>In the midst of France’s <em>ann</em><em>ée terrible</em>, there’s a panther loose in Paris. It’s “black as a hole and [moves] like liquid”, and those who see it take it as a bad harbinger. Who can blame them for suspecting the supernatural, when their city’s been turned upside down? Although there’s a more mundane explanation – the panther has escaped from the menagerie of the Jardin des Plantes – it’s emblematic of an extraordinary and terrible year. Stef Penney’s fourth novel opens in May 1870, just before the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian war. It chronicles the siege of Paris – four months of shellfire and starvation – and even then is only halfway done. After the French defeat in January 1871, Paris is far from peaceful: revolution follows, and the radical Paris Commune takes control of the city until its violent defeat in May 1871. To cram all these events into one novel is ambitious, but the result is electrifying.</p><p>Admittedly, things start slowly. The novel roves among Parisians who have little inkling of what the year will hold. Ellis Butterfield, dissolute nephew of the American ambassador, dabbles in poetry and struggles to repress his experiences as a surgeon in the American civil war. The Lamy family – whose photography business marks them out as only semi-respectable, even without the erotic shots that pay their bills – have ambitions for their daughter’s marriage, while their Canadian assistant Lawrence Harper tentatively circles a romance with another man. The most immediately arresting of this cast is Anne Petitjean, Creole inmate of the Salpêtrière asylum, who is obliged to be hypnotised on stage by her physician, and who harbours a passionate fascination for the tiger in the nearby menagerie.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/30/the-beasts-of-paris-by-stef-penney-review-radicals-and-romantics">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The town’s fabled music festival is just one side of a place that is framed by natural beauty to hike through – and wine heritage you can savour</p><p>My aunt Carol, an enthusiastic traveller and music lover, was driving back to the UK from the Algarve in her veteran campervan when she decided, on a whim, to swing right near Lyon and make for the Montreux jazz festival on the shores of Lake Geneva (Lac Léman).</p><p>This was 1987 and travel was still analogue. She hadn’t phoned with any indication of her whereabouts but, one day in July, Carol’s campervan suddenly appeared in my folks’ driveway in the south London suburbs. Out she jumped, with cassette tapes of all the gigs she’d been to spilling from the driver’s door behind her.

<p>Sumo – a historical Japanese martial art and a longtime favourite sport of the nation – is open solely to male professionals. But female sumo wrestling does exist and thrive, mainly as a school or university club activity.

But female sumo wrestlers are fighting hard to be heard and to be allowed to practice at a professional level</p><p>Today, gender equality is on everyone’s mind and is a major subject of global debate. Inclusion in sport is no exception. However, many gaps remain. It is little known that sumo is open solely to male professionals. Women are not allowed to be part of this world, and as long as this tradition remains intact, sumo won’t become part of the Olympic Games.</p><p>Top: differences between female, left, and male sumo uniforms.

But despite the lofty claims those of us who truly love the game might make for it, cricket cannot offer a true reflection of life or of sport in general. Cricket stands apart. Cricket is different.</p><p>That’s the first thing to know as we consider a week of an exhilarating Ashes contest, but also the cloud of the damning Independent Commission for Equity in Cricket (<a href="https://theicec.com/">ICEC</a>) report.

<p>A criminal behaviour order allows the Met police to vet the lyrics of this chart-topping star.

They bragged and threatened over haunting beats, their verses emblematic of UK drill’s raw appeal to a global generation listening and gossiping online. At the time, I worked as an education mentor at an inner-London academy while volunteering at two community centres. Suddenly, all the boys I worked with were talking about the skippity-skip flow of the group’s 17-year-old frontman, Digga D.</p><p>Nearly six years later, I meet Digga in Wembley. He has since become a youth cultural phenomenon, topping the UK album chart and scoring three Top 10 singles. “I’m tired of hearing about it,” he says when I mention Next Up?, which was removed by YouTube in 2018 on request from the Metropolitan police after it had been watched more than 11m times: the force claimed it was inciting violence. This summer, an edited version of the song surpassed 100m streams on Spotify. “I wanna tell you: ‘Oh my God, I can’t believe it.’ But, keeping it real, I don’t really think about it. I appreciate it.
