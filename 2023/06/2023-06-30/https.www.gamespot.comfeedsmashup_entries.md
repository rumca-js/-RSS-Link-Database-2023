<p>With <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-could-struggle-to-make-a-profit-after-7-million-debut/1100-6515609/">Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny</a> said to be the final film in the series, it was to be expected that we'd see some older faces come along for the ride. We saw John Rhys Davies in the trailers for the film, but there's at least one more appearance in the film, and the actor called themselves "profoundly happy" to get the chance in an interview with Variety.</p><p><strong>Beware spoilers for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny below.</strong></p><p>We first met Marion Ravenwood in the original Indy film, Raiders of the Lost Ark, where she proved herself an equal to Indiana. The series made good on that at the end of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, which had the two marrying after Indiana's adventure with their shared son, Mutt Williams.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-actor-was-profoundly-happy-for-cameo-in-dial-of-destiny/1100-6515632/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Is A Low-Profile Mechanical Keyboard Good For Gaming? Cherry KW X ULP Review

<p>Cherry is well-known as a pioneer in the keyboard space for its widely adopted mechanical switches. If you've dabbled in the realm of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-gaming-keyboard/1100-6471785/">high-performance keyboards</a>, whether it be for professional use or competitive gaming, you've heard of (and probably used) Cherry MX switches. And you may be well-versed in the distinction between the clicky, tactical MX Blues and the smooth, linear MX Reds (and the several variations in between). While the company hasn't historically dealt in keyboards itself as deeply as other peripheral manufacturers such as Logitech, Razer, Corsair, and the like, it does have a select few high-end keyboards.</p><p>The latest Cherry put out is <span class="norewrite">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C4HRP34X?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20">the low-profile KW X ULP</a> </span>, and I've been fascinated by the prospect of an ultra-slim, ultra-light mechanical keyboard that still uses the full-sized 104-key layout, but is it suited for gaming?</p><figure style="width: 4032px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1574/15747411/4160043-img_2683.jpg"><img alt="The Cherry KW X ULP ultra-slim mechanical keyboard." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1574/15747411/4160043-img_2683.jpg" /></a><figcaption>The Cherry KW X ULP ultra-slim mechanical keyboard.</figcaption></figure><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C4HRP34X?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20">See at Amazon</a> </div><p>The short answer is: not entirely. It comes down to the overall feel of Cherry's proprietary MX Ultra Low Profile mechanical switches. They're much more responsive than a standard membrane design or a slim Apple keyboard since they offer a consistent and responsive keystroke with solid tactility. But my main issue is with how these mechanical switches bounce back--they feel somewhat squishy after a keystroke, as if the keys sink into the board itself. It's like the keys stick to the bottom just a bit too much before coming back up, and in the context of both competitive gaming and high-speed typing, it can hinder your ability to hit your skill ceiling.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-a-low-profile-mechanical-keyboard-good-for-gaming-cherry-kw-x-ulp-review/1100-6515627/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>A new Perfect Dark was revealed at The Game Awards way back in 2020, but a recent report from IGN has indicated that it's release is still years away, despite Xbox's Matt Booty saying that he played it recently.</p><p>This isn't the first time this has happened. In fact, there are <em>many </em>games that have been announced and then gone missing in action. Often, this can do more harm than good, and yet it still keeps happening, which begs the question: why? On this episode of Spot On, Tam and Lucy discuss the dangers that can arise when games are announced too early, and why publishers and developers do it regardless.</p><div>          </div><p>Spot On is a weekly news show airing Fridays in which GameSpot's managing editor Tamoor Hussain and senior producer Lucy James talk about the latest news in games. Given the highly dynamic and never-ending news cycle of the massive video game industry, there's always something to talk about but, unlike most other news shows, Spot On will dive deep into a single topic as opposed to recapping all the news. Spot On airs each Friday.</p>

<p>You can save up to 33% on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Iskur-Gaming-Chair-Multi-Layered/dp/B09CLQ38PF?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">Razer Iskur XL gaming chair</a> at Amazon right now. Regularly $600, you can pick up this gaming chair for only $400. All three color variants are up for grabs at this price: black, gray, and black/green. If you need a slightly smaller gaming chair, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Iskur-Gaming-Chair-Multi-Layered-High-Density/dp/B08JSMTCLK?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">the standard Razer Iskur is $430</a>, down from $500.</p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Iskur-Gaming-Chair-Multi-Layered/dp/B09CLQ38PF?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">See Razer Iskur XL at Amazon</a> </div></div><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Iskur-Gaming-Chair-Multi-Layered-High-Density/dp/B08JSMTCLK?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">See Razer Iskur at Amazon</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr">The Razer Iskur XL is a pretty large chair intended for people between 6’ and 6’10” (hence the “XL” in its name) and can support up to 400lbs. The chair features some of the best back support we’ve found in a gaming chair thanks to its built-in, adjustable lumbar curve for lower back support and adjustable armrests with multiple height and angle options.</p><p dir="ltr">The standard Razer Iskur has the same great lumbar support and overall design, but its slightly smaller build is designed for those who are 5'6" to 6'2" and weigh 300 pounds or less. As you can see, there's some crossover here, so if you're right around six-feet tall, you'd probably be happy with either model.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/razer-iskur-gaming-chairs-are-steeply-discounted-at-amazon/1100-6512042/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Dune: Part Two is coming later this year, and according to star Rebecca Ferguson, it's leaps and bounds different and better than the first one.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://collider.com/dune-2-rebecca-ferguson-comments/">Collider</a>, Ferguson said the sequel is "so f**king good." She said she gets emotional talking about the film because she's so excited by the work done by director Denis Villeneuve, cinematographer Greig Fraser, and the entire team.</p><div>          </div><p>"Number one is phenomenal and big and grandiose, and then you go close-ups and the imagery and the acting. Yeah, it's all great. It's f**king nothing compared to number two. Number two, it's like a f**king gut punch. It's unreal," Ferguson said.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-1-is-fking-nothing-compared-to-the-sequel-actor-says/1100-6515624/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Fans got a hearty helping of Dune: Part Two yesterday with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-2-trailer-has-the-world-at-war-and-timothee-chalamet-riding-the-worm/1100-6515578/">wild new trailer</a>, showing everything from Feyd (Austin Butler) in action, to Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) delivering his iconic speech to the Freman. Even though there are only two parts to the Paul and House Atreides narrative, director Denis Villeneuve wants to fans to get a taste of the larger mythos at play with a third Dune film.</p><p><a href="https://deadline.com/video/dune-part-two-new-trailer-timothee-chalamet-zendaya/">Deadline</a> has reported that Villeneuve intends to cap off his Dune trilogy with a much deeper dive into Frank Herbert's lore of the world of Dune with an adaptation of Dune Messiah. This film would be co-written by Villeneuve and screenwriter Jon Spaihts. Obviously, Warner Bros. Discovery has not yet officially announced active development for Part Three but should Part Two find success like its predecessor, a conclusion should be a no-brainer.</p><p>Dune Messiah was the second novel in the Dune Chronicles released in 1969. The book was adapted in the 2003 miniseries Children of Dune--the name of the actual third novel--which included parts of both "Messiah" and "Children."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/denis-villeneuve-wants-to-end-his-dune-trilogy-with-a-dune-messiah-adaptation/1100-6515626/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Ubisoft is leaning more and more into the pirate's life, it appears. The company appears to be working on a remake of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/">Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag</a>.</p><p>According to a report from <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-4-black-flag-remake-skull-bones-1850596271">Kotaku</a>, the project is still in early development and will not be ready for a few years. The report also says that a team at Ubisoft Singapore will be heavily involved in ensuring the game is up to modern standards.</p><p dir="ltr">Besides that, not much is known about the upcoming remake, and it's unclear if Ubisoft will take inspiration from recent titles such as Assassin's Creed Valhalla to include more RPG elements. It's also worth mentioning that this isn't the only pirate game Ubisoft is making. The studio has been working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/skull-and-bones/">Skull and Bones</a> since 2013, but since then, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-three-unannounced-projects-skull-and-bones-delayed-yet-again/1100-6510481/">the game has been delayed multiple times and will now be released in the 2024 fiscal year</a>. Despite the multiple delays, Ubisoft announced a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skull-and-bones-closed-beta-coming-in-august/1100-6515132/">closed beta for Skull and Bones that'll run from August 25-28</a>.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-is-reportedly-coming/1100-6515623/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Ahead of the Fourth of July weekend, Call of Duty is offering a new patriotic "Tracer Pack: Butch" operator bundle in the in-game shop. This could be a fun choice for anyone wanting to celebrate Independence Day within <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii/">Modern Warfare 2</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20/">Warzone 2</a>, but players have been quick to notice that a weapon included in the bundle looks just like a past holiday gun from Warzone 1.</p><p dir="ltr">The Tracer Pack: Butch operator pack is a nine-item bundle, which includes the Butch operator, two weapon blueprints, the Soaring Eagle vehicle skin, a very buff-looking eagle weapon charm, an Active Duty operator slot for DMZ, and more. This festive pack costs 2,400 CoD Points ($20).</p><p dir="ltr">One of the more controversial items in the pack is the Dawn's Light weapon blueprint for the M4 assault rifle. As seen in the <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1674830229460729865">tweeted image below</a>, players are already pointing out how similar the weapon blueprint looks to one from Warzone 1's July 4 bundle, which was called the 1776 blueprint for Modern Warfare 2019's M4A1 assault rifle.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/controversial-call-of-duty-july-4-operator-bundle-sells-similar-gun-as-warzone-1/1100-6515622/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Daedalic Entertainment, the German developer behind The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, is undergoing many changes following the poor reception to the game earlier this year.</p><p>The studio has canceled a new Lord of the Rings game that was in development, and in fact, Daedalic will no longer make games at all. Going forward, Daedalic will be a publisher only. The company said it has eight "promising" releases set for release this financial year.</p><p>"Even though The Lord of the Rings: Gollum did not live up to the expectations we had for the game, we are very grateful for the opportunity and the learning experience it brought us," the studio said in a statement.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gollum-studios-next-lotr-game-canceled-dev-no-longer-making-games-at-all/1100-6515620/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The biggest fighting game tournament of the year, Evo, is almost here, and it's going to be crowded when the action kicks off in its usual Las Vegas Mandalay Bay location. According to the official Evo Twitter account--and Dragon Ball Z's Vegeta--<em>over 9,000 </em>people are participating in this year's event, a huge increase from last year's 7,000 participants.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/zAUxmKMbUE">pic.twitter.com/zAUxmKMbUE</a></p>  — EVO (@EVO) <a href="https://twitter.com/EVO/status/1674662054291210241?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">June 30, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Thanks to some napkin math by FireSquid Games' <a href="https://twitter.com/ChaosSmurf">Ben Barrett</a>, we've got a rough idea of just how busy the Evo tournament is going to be.

## Aliens: Dark Descent Review - They're In The Walls
 - [https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/aliens-dark-descent-review-theyre-in-the-walls/1900-6418085/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/aliens-dark-descent-review-theyre-in-the-walls/1900-6418085/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f)

<p dir="ltr">There haven't been many games that have adapted the Aliens name that have managed to capture the essence of what makes many of its early films so captivating. The survival-horror game Alien: Isolation comes closest, eschewing the typical direction of action for horror, making its single Xenomorph a terrifying entity that demands the fearful respect so many other adaptations fail to offer it. While there are many, many more Xenomorphs in Aliens: Dark Descent, this hybrid of action and real-time strategy mostly works because it conveys the same sense of fear you feel when engaging them, which makes it easier to gloss over the times its other systems don't quite work as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Aliens: Dark Descent predominantly takes place on the planet Lethe, after a familiar scene of a Xenomorph outbreak takes place on a Weyland-Yutani space station and forces the entire area into a deadly lockdown. As survivors scramble for a way to get off-planet while also investigating the root of the outbreak, you'll travel to numerous locations across the planet to uncover clues, scavenge for supplies, and shoot down anything that gets in your way. Aliens: Dark Descent has the inklings of a captivating tale that never delivers on any of its initial promises, boiling down an interesting premise in the opening hours to a standard story without much to say beyond its straightforward mystery.</p><p dir="ltr">The story is mostly delivered through dialogue between the game's two leads, a surviving administrator from the opening space station and a grizzled space marine with a strange link to the Xenomorphs. Their chemistry is lacking and their relationship swings wildly from one extreme to the next in very short spaces of time, making it difficult to feel engaged in their plight or personal motivations. Secondary characters rarely get any moments to shine, so it's easy to start tuning the entire thing out in lieu of Dark Descent's far more interesting pieces.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/aliens-dark-descent-review-theyre-in-the-walls/1900-6418085/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4</a> has over a hundred dungeons that you'll delve into. Some of these happen to have side quests, which can also be completed along the way.

<p>The circle of streaming life goes on as another month comes to an end, and some of your favorite television shows and movies are put back in their vault. With July on the horizon, you should probably check out some of these before they leave Netflix for a while.</p><p>What has seemed like a Netflix staple for years, Skyfall--Daniel Craig's most revered James Bond outing--will be leaving the streamer at the end of July, so there's plenty of time to get that last rewatch in, in case you don't have it elsewhere. Along with that, the supernatural action franchise starter in 2003's Underworld, and the biopic Julie and Julia with Meryl Streep and Amy Adams. There's also the Ip Man martial arts movie quadrilogy with Donnie Yen.</p><div>          </div><p>Below is a list of all the content leaving Netflix in July.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-bonds-skyfall-julie-and-julia-and-more-leaving-netflix-in-july/1100-6515617/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Hunters can pick up <strong>Orpheus Rig </strong>leg armor; Titans can grab the <strong>Helm of Saint-14 </strong>helmet; and Warlocks can buy the <strong>Nezarec's</strong> <strong>Sin</strong> helmet.</p><h2>Xur Location</h2><figure style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4159812-xurnessus.jpg"><img alt="Xur's location on Nessus." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4159812-xurnessus.jpg" /></a><figcaption>Xur's location on Nessus.</figcaption></figure><p>Head to Nessus and use the Watcher's Grave transmat zone to find Xur this week.

<p>Double Fine Productions has confirmed that it's not working on Psychonauts 3 at the moment, dashing any hopes that the franchise would see a new entry soon.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGsuzHRSQb8">Cressup</a>, Psychonauts creator Tim Schafer said, "I'm not working on Psychonauts 3. We're kind of at the 'Willy Wonka closed doors' phase. But soon we could open and cause a lot of harm to a lot of children, just like Willy Wonka."</p><p>It seems like Schafer is hinting that some information may be revealed at a later date, perhaps related to Psychonauts. Last month, Xbox Australia posted a picture on Twitter that seemed to tease Psychonauts 3, with the words "Psycho" followed by three Xs. However, the account clarified that it was just a joke based on the British game, Noughts and Crosses.

<p>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny officially opens in theaters today, June 30, but the film technically debuted on Thursday night with the first preview screenings.

While the console was left with a face for radio, the internal hardware survived the explosion and it was still capable of running the copy of Tetris that was in it.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">The Gulf War Game Boy has officially been retired from <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoNYC?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">@NintendoNYC</a> <br /><br />After not seeing it on display for a while, I asked one of the workers about it.

<p>It sounds like Larian's upcoming RPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/">Baldur's Gate 3</a> will take you a <em>long </em>time to finish. Larian boss Swen Vincke told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-standard-playthrough-takes-75-to-100-hours-larian-says">IGN</a> that a standard playthrough of the title should take between 75 and 100 hours, though as usual, your mileage will vary and there is no official "runtime" for the game.</p><p>"Between 75 and 100 hours, that's what we're seeing," Vincke said. "That's not doing everything, that is just going to be a playthrough. There will be people who will be way over that, the ones who want to do everything. They will probably hit 200 hours, I think. On average we're seeing people who are going through take about 75 to 100 hours."</p><p>Vincke went on to say that he believes Baldur's Gate 3 offers a good amount of replayability because it has so many classes and races to try out. Not only that, but the game's multiplayer support might help extend the time people spend playing it.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-could-take-up-100-hours-to-finish-a-standard-playthrough/1100-6515603/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>As part of the ongoing Microsoft/Activision Blizzard merger case, a US district judge seemingly revealed when this year's new Call of Duty game is releasing--and it should surprise no one.</p><p>Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley is reported to have said during the court case that the new Call of Duty game coming this year will launch in November. That is no big surprise, as Call of Duty games typically release in the October/November period, but what's notable here is that Activision itself hasn't announced a release month so far. It's only said the game is coming this fall. The game, meanwhile, has not been officially announced--it's rumored to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-with-campaign-multiplayer-and-zombies-coming-this-november-report/1100-6514109/">Modern Warfare 3 from developer Sledgehammer Games</a>.</p><p>Judge Corley also stated during proceedings that COD 2023 will launch on PlayStation platforms, which is also no surprise.

<p>Baldur's Gate 3, the latest video game based on the Dungeons and Dragons tabletop RPG, doesn't have an Xbox release date. Larian Studios announced long ago that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-for-ps5-delayed-pc-version-moved-up-to-avoid-starfield/1100-6515575/">PlayStation 5 version</a> was on the way, but has now clarified on its plans for an Xbox version.</p><div>          </div><p>Larian <em>wants</em> to bring Baldur's Gate 3 to Xbox Series S and X. In the latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/3657534571513526776">Baldur's Gate 3</a> blog post, developers confirmed that they are still working on support for Xbox Series X and S, with S being the console holding things back for now.

"We’re optimistic about Baldur’s Gate 3 on the Xbox Series X, but in order to announce and release the game on Xbox, we need to ensure that the game is performing without compromise across the entire Xbox X|S ecosystem, in multiplayer and with split-screen."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-might-come-to-xbox-this-year/1100-6515596/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
