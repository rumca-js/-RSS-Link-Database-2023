Support your local PBS station here: http://www.pbs.org/donate\u200b.\n\nLast fall, anti-government protests swept across Iran after the death in police custody of a young woman, Mahsa Zhina Amini, who was accused of not adhering to the Islamic regime\u2019s strict dress code. In the crackdown on protests that followed, human rights groups estimate that more than 500 Iranians have been killed, including 72 children.\n\nIn a country where journalists are tightly controlled, young Iranians have been filming the uprising themselves and posting the videos online. For more than six months, FRONTLINE has been gathering and reviewing over 100 hours of this footage, cross-checking it with testimony from eyewitnesses and protestors, and following activists and exiles who have been gathering evidence of human rights violations.\n\nThe resulting documentary, \u201cInside the Iranian Uprising,\u201d premieres on streaming platforms June 29 and on PBS stations August 8. It features the harrowing stories of protestors, some of whom are still in the country and are speaking out despite the risks, and it sheds new light on the lengths to which the regime of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has gone to put down the uprising. \n\n\u201cThe people are now like a volcano,\u201d one interviewee says. \u201cI am a volcano.\u201d\n\nExplore additional reporting related to \"Inside The Iranian Uprising\" on our website:\nhttps://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/documentary/inside-the-iranian-uprising/\n\nInside the Iranian Uprising is a Passion Pictures production for GBH/FRONTLINE in association with BBC and RAI.
