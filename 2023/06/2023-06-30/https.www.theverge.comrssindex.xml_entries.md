  <p id="LAhUsH">Ever heard the urban legend about how the original Nintendo Game Boy survived a bomb? I have reason to believe that’s not true. But until recently, the flagship Nintendo Store at New York City’s Rockefeller Center housed an original Game Boy that, it claimed, was damaged in a bombing during Operation Desert Storm.</p>
<p id="z7Bc5l">We just confirmed with Nintendo New York that, after many years on display, the Gulf War Game Boy is no longer there. <a href="https://twitter.com/VGArtAndTidbits/status/1674357378790170624">VideoGameArt&amp;Tidbits</a> was the first to report the news; they say a worker told them it was returned to Nintendo’s US headquarters in Washington state.</p>
<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="i9gbur"><q>We spoke to the store... and the owner</q></aside></div>
<p id="15MD3D">If it’s true, and if it’s not coming back, we’re hoping that Nintendo will display it somewhere else. But just in case it...</p>

<p id="Lv0Qul">Why? Because this is not the agency that consumers should listen to with regard to food safety. The IARC only assesses the hazard of a given substance, not the risk. For example, there is a hazard of a meteor destroying the Earth or the sun causing skin cancer. But that’s not what matters to the average person. What matters is the actual risk of a hazard happening. There are thousands of meteors in space, but only the ones hurtling...</p>

  <p id="EIKSrZ">If you’re looking for a third-party Reddit app for Android after rif is fun for Reddit (RIF) goes away soon, you’re going to have a few options. The developer of Relay for Reddit announced Friday that the app would continue to be available after July 1st, while the developer of Now and Nara for Reddit said those apps will continue on, too.</p>
<p id="uZyEXR"><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=reddit.news&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Relay</a> will be moving the app to a subscription model, developer DBrady <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RelayForReddit/comments/14n876v/update_relay_will_continue_to_operate_from_july/">announced in a Reddit post</a>. Reddit will start charging for its paid API on July 1st, and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/31/23743993/reddit-apollo-client-api-cost">potential costs</a> of that are forcing apps like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/8/23754616/reddit-third-party-apps-api-shutdown-rif-reddplanet-sync">RIF</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/8/23754183/apollo-reddit-app-shutting-down-api">Apollo for Reddit</a> to shut down. But DBrady seems to have found a way to make the numbers work with subscriptions — something they said they were contemplating <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/12/23758616/reddit-app-survive-paid-subscription-relay">earlier this month</a>.</p>

Japan has long been a popular market for virtual streamers (also known as “Vtubers”), content creators who portray fictional, animated characters — usually through motion capture — so it made sense for the company to test the water there.

The Competition and Markets Authority announced on Friday that unless Adobe or Figma can offer “acceptable undertakings” to address its concerns by July 7th, the acquisition will be subject to a deeper investigation that risks derailing the deal entirely.</p>

  <p id="Pj7o8g">If you, too, are so very tired of not knowing which reviews to trust on the internet, we may eventually get some peace of mind.

Under the terms of <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/r311003consumerreviewsandtestimonials_nprm.pdf">a new rule</a> proposed by the FTC, businesses could face fines for buying fake reviews — to the tune of up to $50,000 for each time a customer sees one.</p>

  <p id="Qn7ttx">I have a packed issue this week, starting with the implosion of a once-hot social media startup called IRL. It raised $200 million at over a $1 billion valuation, and now its board is dissolving the company after finding that most of its users were fake. The SEC is investigating. It’s a whole mess. I have ex-CEO <strong>Abraham Shafi’s</strong> first public comments on the situation since he was ousted by the board. </p>
<p id="YOC1K9">Also in this issue: a convo with the earliest investor in MosaicML, the AI startup that just sold to Databricks for more than $1 billion; some notes on Google’s AR strategy; a scoop about Meta getting into the app distribution game; drug use in Silicon Valley; a Musk-versus-Zuckerberg cage match update; and more…</p>

  <p id="gyRenb">When the island nation of Nauru <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/01/03/mining-the-bottom-of-the-sea">announced</a> that it would sponsor a deep-sea mining effort for battery materials, the country sent scientists and world leaders into a panic. It meant that companies might soon start harvesting minerals like nickel, cobalt, and copper from the ocean’s deepest depths for the first time. Scientists raised the alarm: what havoc would that do to ecosystems that humans are barely starting to understand? </p>
<p id="YYPhTD">The move set a deadline for the International Seabed Authority (ISA) to decide on regulations for deep-sea mining by July 2023. That<strong> </strong>deadline to craft regulation is nearly here — and the ISA, an international organization established by the 1982 <a href="http://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/convention_overview_convention.htm">United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea</a>, is expected to miss...</p>

While the A2 may be considered entry-level compared to LG’s other OLED models, it’s still an excellent panel. The A2 has the rich color contrast expected of OLEDs, and though it may not stack up to the brightness and features of newer, higher-end models like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23453621/lg-c2-oled-tv-review">C2</a> or...</p>

Because only a person who has either been completely absent from the fighting games scene for the last 10 years or is so thoroughly confident in their own abilities to the point of self-delusion would ever do to SonicFox what BradonNinjaa did — challenge them to <em>Mortal Kombat</em>.</p>

Instead, you’ll likely be met with the Twitter window that asks you to either sign in to the platform or create a new account, effectively blocking you from viewing tweets and user profiles or browsing through threads unless you’re a registered Twitter user.</p>
<p id="0zBizQ">Several members of <em>The Verge</em> team have been able to replicate the issue, and it appears to be affecting web access on both desktop and mobile devices. Prior to this change, Twitter allowed people limited access to the platform without an account — you could view public tweets and user profiles, for...</p>

## Google is in hot water over video ads

  <p id="LHfWiZ">Google is facing scrutiny over claims it misled advertisers about where it places video ads — and whether it violated US sanctions. As <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-violated-its-standards-in-ad-deals-research-finds-3e24e041">reported earlier by <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>, research <a href="https://adalytics.io/blog/invalid-google-video-partner-trueview-ads">from the analytics company Adalytics</a> suggests that Google “may have cost media buyers up to billions of digital ad dollars” by putting ads on sites in ways that violate Google’s own standards.</p>
<p id="o6jaxe">The report centers around one of Google’s video ad formats, called TrueView, which the company places on YouTube and other sites across the web, called Google video partners. These ads appear during videos and give viewers the option to skip the entirety of the advertisement after five seconds. Advertisers only pay for the ad if a viewer watches at least 30...</p>

<p id="qgI4Kp">Last July, as the Instagram feed began to fill up with recommended posts, the company was thrown briefly into crisis.

  <p id="7gnIpv">Transferring your WhatsApp messages and large attachments between phones running the same operating system could soon be a little easier. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has announced a new chat transfer feature that bypasses any cloud backups simply by scanning a QR code shown on your old phone with your new phone. “Data is only shared between your two devices, and is fully encrypted during transfer,” WhatsApp’s announcement of the new feature says.</p>
<p id="m5vMNG">The new process has the potential to be a lot quicker and easier than the existing cloud-based alternative, which involves backing up a history of your chats to iCloud or Google Drive and then <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/618575946635920/?cms_platform=android&amp;helpref=platform_switcher">downloading it to a new device</a>.

  <p id="7XBwzp">Thousands of influencers post content online with one goal: getting a brand deal. It’s affirmation that they’ve “made it” as an influencer, that they’re interesting enough to be paid to post, and that content creation could be a job. It’s usually a good thing — until, of course, it blows up in your face.</p>
<p id="kz6AFy">It’s not clear to me why anyone involved in Shein’s recent PR campaign thought it was a good idea to send influencers on a free trip to try to beat the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/5/23494891/shein-factories-improvement-labor-violations-investigation-ecommerce-fast-fashion">labor exploitation accusations</a> that plague the company.

  <p id="lrO8Zp">The summer of sci-fi continues over on Apple TV Plus. Just as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23711259/silo-review-season-1-apple-tv-plus">season 1 of <em>Silo</em></a> ends and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23759153/foundation-season-2-trailer-apple-tv-plus">a new season of <em>Foundation</em></a> is about to begin, Apple has confirmed that its alien series <em>Invasion</em> will be back very soon. The first episode of a 10-episode-long season 2 will premiere on August 23rd, with new ones dropping on Wednesdays. As part of the announcement, we also got some early images of season 2 that include a cool spacesuit and what seems like a pretty war-torn version of Earth.</p>
