[{"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Spotify reportedly wants to add full-length music videos to its app", "description": "<p>Spotify might soon let you watch music, not just listen to it. <em>Bloomberg</em><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-30/spotify-is-in-talks-to-test-full-length-music-videos-in-app?sref=10lNAhZ9\">sources</a> claim the streaming service is mulling the addition of full-length music videos to its app. The company is reportedly talking to potential partners, but it's not clear who would support the feature or when it might arrive. Spotify has already declined to comment.</p><p>Video on Spotify is currently limited to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/spotify-expands-video-podcast-publishing-140019445.html\">podcasts</a>, 30-second storytelling clips (to help artists talk about their work) and 10-second GIFs that loop while you listen to a given song. The media giant launched a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/spotify-debuts-its-tiktok-style-music-discovery-feed-183359654.html\">TikTok-like home feed</a> in March, but it's meant more for discovering music and podcasts than video viewing. The company tried using TV content <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2015-05-20-spotify-adds-video-podcasts.html\">several years ago</a>, such as clips from Comedy Central and ESPN, but it didn't gain much traction.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The concept isn't novel for streaming music services. Apple Music has had music videos for years. Spotify's addition would help it match Apple, though, and might lure audiences who would otherwise watch the videos on YouTube. It would also add content to the new feed and help Spotify draw musically-inclined viewers from social networks like Instagram and TikTok.</p><p>Music videos don't generate much direct revenue by themselves. YouTube gives creators a 55 percent share of ad revenue, which on average <a href=\"https://influencermarketinghub.com/how-much-do-youtubers-make/\">amounts</a> to $18 per 1,000 views. Artists, labels and others involved then have to split that small amount. The clips supplement audio income, though, and potentially improve exposure for musicians.</p><p>There's pressure to find new sources of income, too. Spotify <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/spotify-will-lay-off-6-percent-of-employees-130337498.html\">laid off a significant portion of its staff</a> earlier this year, including <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/spotify-is-laying-off-200-employees-from-its-podcast-division-134749721.html\">200 in its podcast team</a>, as it grappled with both a rough global economy and business missteps. Music videos could improve the company's finances without requiring a large production team, as is the case with podcasts.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/spotify-reportedly-wants-to-add-full-length-music-videos-to-its-app-210427926.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/spotify-reportedly-wants-to-add-full-length-music-videos-to-its-app-210427926.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-30T21:04:27+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "An Overwatch anime miniseries will debut on July 6th", "description": "<p>Blizzard has released a string of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skhxJ-6UpKo\">excellent Overwatch animated shorts</a> over the years.

But he struck an optimistic tone for investors eager to see <em>Roblox</em> on Sony consoles. \u201cOver the last couple of years, however, we have reviewed those policies and relaxed a little on this.

The beloved title, which lets users create, share and play user-created content, is available for Xbox, iOS, Android, Windows and macOS.

More than half of the platform\u2019s daily users are under 13. Although it forbids content displaying sexual activity, illegal substances and swearing, occasional rule-breaking content can slip past moderation in user-created titles.

As <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/30/fake-reviews-online-ftc/\"><em><ins>The Washington Post</ins></em></a> points out, the FTC plans to slap businesses that &quot;buy, sell and manipulate online reviews&quot; up to $50,000. Not only is that fine for each phony review, it's also for every time a consumer sees it. So, if the FTC finds out that one fake review has been viewed just 20 times, the business that bought it could be on the hook for $1 million.</p><p>\u201cOur proposed rule on fake reviews shows that we\u2019re using all available means to attack deceptive advertising in the digital age,\u201d Samuel Levine, the director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement. \u201cThe rule would trigger civil penalties for violators and should help level the playing field for honest companies.\u201d</p><p>Explicitly, the FTC aims to ban &quot;businesses from writing or selling consumer reviews or testimonials by someone who does not exist, who did not have experience with the product or service, or who misrepresented their experiences.&quot; Similarly, companies won't be allowed to obtain or disseminate reviews and testimonials that they &quot;knew or should have known that they were fake or false.&quot;</p><p>Repurposing an existing review to make it appear that it was written for a different product (i.e. review hijacking) will be outlawed, as will offering payments or other kinds of compensation for positive or negative reviews. The FTC says companies can still ask users to leave a review, as that's an important way for small businesses to enhance their reputations.</p><p>Managers and officers won't be allowed to post reviews of their company's products without clear disclosures and nor can they ask family members or employees to do so in certain circumstances. Under the proposed rule, companies won't be allowed to run websites that claim to offer independent reviews of categories of products and services that include their own offerings.</p><p>Review suppression will be banned as well. Companies won't be allowed to use intimidation tactics, such as legal threats and false accusations, to push customers to remove or avoid leaving a negative review.</p><p>In addition, the FTC seeks to ban companies from using fake followers and views to fluff up their social media numbers. &quot;The proposed rule also would bar anyone from buying such indicators to misrepresent their importance for a commercial purpose,&quot; the agency said. This is a provision that could have far-reaching consequences beyond commerce \u2014 influencers may have to ensure they don't factor in bots when they try to secure brand deals.</p><p>Meanwhile, the proposed notice for the rule takes note of the popularity of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/generative-ai/\"><ins>generative AI</ins></a>. &quot;It has been reported that an AI chatbot is being used to create fake reviews,&quot; it reads. &quot;As the reporting notes, the widespread emergence of AI chatbots is likely to make it easier for bad actors to write fake reviews.&quot;</p><p>The rule won't take effect immediately. It will be open to public comments for a 60-day period, after which the agency will consider changes before finalizing the directive.</p><p>A lot of these provisions make sense. In essence, the FTC is trying to ensure that businesses and brands are transparent and honest with consumers. Actually enforcing these measures, however, is a different matter. The agency told the <em>Post </em>that it won't be getting extra resources to tackle purveyors of fake reviews, but a codified rule can strengthen its hand in court. Taking on companies based overseas that sell and post phony reviews might be a difficult task too. Still, a formal ban on these practices and the threat of eye-popping fines may be enough to deter some companies from using fake reviews.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-ftc-plans-to-slap-companies-with-hefty-fines-for-using-fake-reviews-192833691.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/the-ftc-plans-to-slap-companies-with-hefty-fines-for-using-fake-reviews-192833691.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-30T19:28:33+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "This nifty fan-made Game Boy camera is the size of a cartridge", "description": "<p>The official Game Boy Camera is a treat for fans of lo-fi photography, but it\u2019s also on the larger side, protruding from the retro console like a giant, creepy eyeball.

It might be difficult to stop the military-industrial complex from producing <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017-07-25-will-we-be-able-to-control-the-killer-robots-of-tomorrow.html\"><ins>battle robots</ins></a>, for instance, he says \u2014 companies and armies might \u201clove\u201d wars where the casualties are machines that can easily be replaced. And while Hinton believes that large language models (trained AI that produces human-like text, like <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/openai-just-released-gpt-4-a-multi-modal-generative-ai-172326765.html\"><ins>OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4</ins></a>) could lead to huge increases in productivity, he is concerned that the ruling class might simply exploit this to enrich themselves, widening an already large wealth gap. It would \u201cmake the rich richer and the poor poorer,\u201d Hinton said.</p><p>Hinton also reiterated his much-publicized view that AI could <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai-presents-risk-of-extinction-on-par-with-nuclear-war-industry-leaders-say-114025874.html\"><ins>pose an existential risk</ins></a> to humanity. If artificial intelligence becomes smarter than humans, there is no guarantee that people will remain in charge. \u201cWe\u2019re in trouble\u201d if AI decides that taking control is necessary to achieve its goals, Hinton said. To him, the threats are \u201cnot just science fiction;\u201d they have to be taken seriously. He worries that society would only rein in killer robots after it had a chance to see \u201cjust how awful\u201d they were.</p><p>There are plenty of existing problems, Hinton added. He argues that <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/metas-newest-ai-fairness-benchmark-measures-even-more-granular-bias-markers-140043320.html\"><ins>bias and discrimination</ins></a> remain issues, as skewed AI training data can produce unfair results. Algorithms likewise create <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017-05-05-facebook-topics-to-follow-news-feed-fake-news.html\"><ins>echo chambers</ins></a> that reinforce misinformation and mental health issues. Hinton also worries about AI spreading misinformation beyond those chambers. He isn\u2019t sure if it\u2019s possible to catch every bogus claim, even though it\u2019s \u201cimportant to mark everything fake as fake.\u201d</p><p>This isn\u2019t to say that Hinton despairs over AI\u2019s impact, although he warns that healthy uses of the technology might come at a high price. Humans might have to conduct \u201cempirical work\u201d into understanding how AI could go wrong, and to prevent it from wresting control. It\u2019s already \u201cdoable\u201d to correct biases, he added. A large language model AI might put an end to echo chambers, but Hinton sees changes in company policies as being particularly important.</p><p>The professor didn\u2019t mince words in his answer to questions about people losing their jobs through automation. He feels that \u201csocialism\u201d is needed to address inequality, and that people could hedge against joblessness by taking up careers that could change with the times, like plumbing (and no, he isn\u2019t kidding). Effectively, society might have to make broad changes to adapt to AI.</p><h2>The industry remains optimistic</h2><h2></h2><figure><img alt=\"Google DeepMind's Colin Murdoch at Collision 2023\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/60fed960-176e-11ee-91ef-5acce9cb8167\" style=\"height: 1280px; width: 1920px;\" /><figcaption>Google DeepMind CBO Colin Murdoch at Collision 2023.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Jon Fingas/Engadget</div></figure><h2></h2><p>Earlier talks at Collision were more hopeful.

Murdoch stressed that DeepMind wanted \u201csafe, ethical and inclusive\u201d AI, and pointed to expert consultations and educational investments as evidence. The executive insists he is open to regulation, but only as long as it allows \u201camazing breakthroughs.\u201d In turn, McGuire said Roblox always launched generative AI tools with content moderation, relied on diverse data sets and practiced transparency.</p><h2>Some hope for the future</h2><h2></h2><figure><img alt=\"Roblox's Morgan McGuire at Collision 2023\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/020206c0-176f-11ee-b5fe-5e55ab8668b7\" style=\"height: 1280px; width: 1920px;\" /><figcaption>Roblox Chief Scientist Morgan McGuire talks at Collision 2023.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Jon Fingas/Engadget</div></figure><h2></h2><p>Despite the headlines summarizing his recent comments, Hinton\u2019s overall enthusiasm for AI hasn\u2019t been dampened after leaving Google.

The law tries to regulate the internet outside state laws while ignoring federal law, according to the lawsuit.

The law requires age verification for all users by submitting driver's licenses and other &quot;commercially reasonable&quot; methods. Anyone under 18 also needs to get a parent's consent.  There are exceptions that appear to cover major social networks and their associated categories, such as those for &quot;professional networking&quot; (think LinkedIn) or short entertaining video clips (like TikTok).</p><p>Arkansas' requirement is part of a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/why-lawmakers-are-pushing-age-verification-requirements-for-social-media-platforms-190037563.html\">greater trend among politicians</a> to demand age verification for social media. States <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/utah-passes-laws-requiring-parental-permission-for-teens-to-use-social-media-223302739.html\">like Utah</a>, Connecticut and Ohio have either passed or are considering similar laws, while Senator Josh Hawley proposed a federal bill barring all social media access for kids under 16.

Usually $50, you can get them for $35, which is $15 off and the lowest price we\u2019ve seen yet. For the third generation of Amazon\u2019s buds, the company dropped the starting price $70 lower than the second gen buds, but also removed the active noise cancellation and changed the shape to eliminate the in-ear tip. Most other specs stayed the same, including built-in Alexa assistance and customizable tap controls. The charge capacity of the case actually went up by a few hours, giving you 20 total hours from the buds and case combined.</p><h2>Amazon Kindle Unlimited 3-month membership</h2><p></p><p>If you're a Prime member who has never subscribed to Kindle Unlimited, you can <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9raW5kbGUtZGJzL2h6L3N1YnNjcmliZS9rdS8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMTRhLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3OTE3YzIyYS03ODg5LTRjMzItYTJkOS05NWFhY2RhMWQyMTEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZew2V5BGQRdc25jyLp03WE4GY7qVmiV3lpy7humgfuu&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fkindle-dbs%2Fhz%2Fsubscribe%2Fku%2F\">get a three-month trial</a> to Amazon's e-book service for no extra cost. Normally, the subscription goes for $12 a month after a 30-day free trial. Just note that the membership will be set to auto-renew by default. As a refresher, Kindle Unlimited makes a selection of e-books, audiobooks and digital magazines accessible on-demand. It doesn't include every e-book in the Kindle library, but it may still be worthwhile if you're a particularly avid reader. If nothing else, this deal makes it easier to figure out if it's worth paying for.&nbsp;</p><h2>Audible Premium Plus 3-month membership</h2><p></p><p>Similar to that Kindle Unlimited offer, Prime members who are new to <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9oei9hdWRpYmxlL21scC9tZW1iZXJzaGlwL3ByZW1pdW1wbHVzL21vbnRobHkvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTE0YS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNzkxN2MyMmEtNzg4OS00YzMyLWEyZDktOTVhYWNkYTFkMjExIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAZpqgGCWvNcQw7ZFmuj-8XcFALCFtgJTwYa2OFHsZ9bU&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fhz%2Faudible%2Fmlp%2Fmembership%2Fpremiumplus%2Fmonthly%2F\">Audible Premium Plus</a> can get three months of the audiobook service for free. This membership usually costs $14.95 a month after a 30-day free trial, so you're saving about $30. Premium Plus is Audible's <a href=\"https://help.audible.com/s/article/what-is-included-in-audible-membership-plans?language=en_US\">upper tier</a>: Like the less expensive Audible Plus, it provides an assortment of audiobooks, podcasts and other audio content you can access on-demand. The main difference is that it also includes a monthly credit that you can use to buy any book in the Audible store permanently. As with Kindle Unlimited, Premium Plus will be most worth it if you burn through audiobooks and podcasts quickly, but this extended trial is a comfier way to see if it's useful. Again, be aware that the subscription will be set to auto-renew by default.</p><h2>Motorola Razr+</h2><p></p><p>The <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Nb3Rvcm9sYS1yYXpyLVVubG9ja2VkLU1QQ2FtZXJhLUJsYWNrL2RwL0IwQzJYRjQzQkQ_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMTRhLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3OTE3YzIyYS03ODg5LTRjMzItYTJkOS05NWFhY2RhMWQyMTEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAbiy-8Z59b84nCXguxS0N34pZF4TxzlORkIMoQuEK0_O&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMotorola-razr-Unlocked-MPCamera-Black%2Fdp%2FB0C2XF43BD\">foldable Moto Razr+</a>, which went on sale just this week, is already getting a 15 percent discount at Amazon for Prime Day.

The verdict? Samsung\u2019s Galaxy foldables have some serious competition. The Razr+ has a 6.9-inch screen when open and offers a 3.6-inch screen when folded, which is much larger than the 1.9-inch exterior screen on the Galaxy Z Flip 4.

You'll see the price listed as $279 and an additional $29 discount will apply at checkout. Apple normally sells the device for $329, though we've seen it retail closer to $275 in recent months. This is the budget pick in <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-ipads-how-to-pick-the-best-apple-tablet-for-you-150054066.html\">our iPad buying guide</a>: It lacks the accessory support, thinner bezels and laminated display of the iPad Air, but it's by far the most affordable route into iPadOS, and it remains fast and comfortable enough for casual reading, streaming and gaming.

But if you just want a competent MacBook to do light work and web browsing for as little cash as possible, the M1 Air remains a solid value at this price. Its keyboard, trackpad and battery life are still excellent, and the M1 chip is still fast enough for the essentials. Just make sure you stick to lighter workloads, though, as this model only has 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD.&nbsp;</p><h2>Xbox Series X + bonus controller bundle</h2><p></p><p>Microsoft had a big showing at this month's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/summer-game-fest-2023-all-the-games-announced-140053892.html\">Summer Game Fest</a>, so if you planned on picking up an Xbox Series X <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=89f68c82-f255-44fa-8db9-03fec996b93a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YouTube&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4OWY2OGM4Mi1mMjU1LTQ0ZmEtOGRiOS0wM2ZlYzk5NmI5M2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj0xaUxvZ3R3NmRLUSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNzkxN2MyMmEtNzg4OS00YzMyLWEyZDktOTVhYWNkYTFkMjExIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAR67s_ZXpseJDSY9mPaaUFAdEEADR5DZmtpR9mEruWTF&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D1iLogtw6dKQ\">before <em>Starfield</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/forza-motorsport-wants-you-to-drive-forever-183033371.html\"><em>Forza Motorsport</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>arrive, note that Verizon is selling <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2225d53b-bfe1-4d56-bd6e-3885c642b140&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Verizon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyMjI1ZDUzYi1iZmUxLTRkNTYtYmQ2ZS0zODg1YzY0MmIxNDAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudmVyaXpvbi5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMveGJveC1zZXJpZXMteC1wbHVzLWZyZWUtcm9ib3Qtd2hpdGUtY29udHJvbGxlci1idW5kbGUvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3OTE3YzIyYS03ODg5LTRjMzItYTJkOS05NWFhY2RhMWQyMTEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAV30_0N3PybdPvsjnA1rcakxFObDChMXScFBSBKnZj9z&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fxbox-series-x-plus-free-robot-white-controller-bundle%2F\">the $500 console with a second controller</a> for no extra cost.

That's a new all-time low. Most reviews say this TV delivers enough brightness for well-lit rooms, with smooth motion performance and richer contrast than most non-OLED TVs thanks to its Mini LED backlighting. It also has four full HDMI 2.1 ports and can play up to 120 Hz in 4K.

The app called Ripple is only available in the US for now, and the company is testing it in a closed beta environment. ByteDance says it can assist creators in the way portable smart digital audio workstations (DAWs) can and is perhaps most useful for beginners and anybody who'd rather not deal with more complex systems. It was also designed to make it easier for creators to add custom soundtracks to their short-form videos for TikTok and other platforms.</p><p>Ripple can create songs in various genres based on a melody the user hums. The app prompts them into humming into the phone mic and then generates instrumentals they can use, such as drums, bass and piano. The length of the song output will match the length of the input, though \u2014 the app can't generate a full soundtrack from just a few seconds of humming. Also, Ripple can only generate instrumental music, leaving the vocal work to creators.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>ByteDance told us that Ripple's model was trained on music it owns and music that was licensed to the company. The company also said that it's committed to respecting the rights of its artists and its rightsholder partners. To note, there have been concerns about the source of data used to train artificial intelligence systems and algorithms. Just recently, a lawsuit seeking class action status was <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/28/openai-chatgpt-lawsuit-class-action/\">filed against OpenAI</a>, accusing it of violating the copyrights and privacy of countless individuals by using data scraped from the internet to train the model used for ChatGPT.&nbsp;</p><p>At the moment, Ripple is invite-only, and ByteDance doesn't have further rollout plans yet. Those who want to check it out before anybody else can visit <a href=\"https://www.ripple.club/\">Ripple.club</a>, where they can find a download link for the app on iOS and from where they can request an invite.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-owner-bytedance-debuts-ripple-music-creation-app-130023602.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-owner-bytedance-debuts-ripple-music-creation-app-130023602.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-30T13:00:23+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Engadget Podcast: The rise of foldable competitors for Samsung", "description": "<p>This episode, Cherlynn is joined by senior writer Sam Rutherford and senior commerce editor at <em>Wired</em> Julian Chokkattu to talk about our reviews of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-fold-review-the-challenger-that-samsung-needs-specs-price-170003458.html\">the Pixel Fold</a>.

The court also imposed a 5 million rupee ($61,000 fine) on the Elon Musk-owned firm.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Your client (Twitter) was given notices and your client did not comply. Punishment for non-compliance is seven years imprisonment and unlimited fine. That also did not deter your client,&quot; the judge told Twitter's legal representation. &quot;So you have not given any reason why you delayed compliance, more than a year of delay\u2026 then all of sudden you comply and approach the Court. You are not a farmer but a billon dollar company.&quot;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Twitter\u2019s relationship with India was fraught for much of 2021. In February, the government <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/india-government-jail-twitter-employees-block-critics-122405568.html\">threatened</a> to jail Twitter employees unless the company removed content related to protests by farmers held that year. Shortly after that, India ordered Twitter to pull tweets criticizing the country\u2019s response to the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/india-orders-twitter-to-remove-covid-19-tweets-164716146.html\">COVID-19 pandemic</a>. More recently, the government ordered Twitter to block tweets from <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/\">Freedom House</a>, a nonprofit organization that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/freedomhouse/status/1542538616437673984?s=20&amp;t=Jg8iH94UWl0dLu4A3hAVzA\">claimed</a> India was an example of a country where freedom of the press is on the decline.</p><p>Those incidents put Twitter in a compromising situation. It either had to comply with government orders to block content (and face censorship criticism inside and outside the country), or ignore them and risk losing <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/india-twitter-social-media-rules-warning-143825408.html\">its legal immunity</a>. In August, it <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-india-it-laws-114018030.html\">complied with the orders</a> and took down content as ordered.</p><p>The court order follows <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MeghUpdates/status/1668343422342811648\">recent comments</a> from Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, saying that India threatened to raid employees homes if it didn't comply with orders to remove posts and accounts.

After launching aboard the mothership VMS Eve, the spaceship VSS Unity reached an altitude of around 52 miles, or the edge of space. Itss first client was the Italian government, which had the aim of conducting microgravity research. The company's first fully crewed spaceflight took place in 2021, when Unity hit an altitude of 53.4 miles with founder Richard Branson on board. However, commercial service was delayed multiple times for different reasons, most recently due to issues with upgrading the mothership VMS Eve.

That's likely about 18 months away, aerospace engineer and Vertical Flight Society director Mike Hirschberg told <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1fa16fbb-59f6-4e22-9ee4-e51608b12319&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=New+Scientist&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIxZmExNmZiYi01OWY2LTRlMjItOWVlNC1lNTE2MDhiMTIzMTkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3c2NpZW50aXN0LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIzODA2MzktZWxlY3RyaWMtZmx5aW5nLXZlaGljbGUtZ2V0cy1jbGVhcmFuY2UtZm9yLWZsaWdodC10ZXN0cy1pbi10aGUtdXMvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4NzFiNTYwOC05ZGI3LTQ1NmQtYWY3YS0wMTFlNWNlMjE5Y2MifQ&amp;signature=AQAAATaak3-RZcyrHGkaZyzkJzgg2TWUtjmCraEJq5_BA8Ot&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newscientist.com%2Farticle%2F2380639-electric-flying-vehicle-gets-clearance-for-flight-tests-in-the-us%2F\"><em>New Scientist</em></a>.

Last year, the Kittyhawk aircraft backed by Larry Page <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/kittyhawk-is-shutting-down-214542598.html\">shut down</a>, and other companies like <a href=\"https://thebambooworks.com/ehang-ready-for-takeoff/\">Ehang</a>, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/united-and-archer-will-open-an-air-taxi-route-to-chicagos-ohare-airport-in-2025-191352804.html\">Archer</a>, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/volocopter-voloconnect-drone-taxi-first-flight-135531242.html\">Volocopter</a> and even <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-22-airbus-vahana-flying-taxi-interior.html\">Airbus</a> aren't as far along as Joby. \"This first aircraft coming off our pilot manufacturing line is a really, really big deal for the company,\" Joby CEO JoeBen Bevirt told <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/28/joby-aviation-receives-permit-to-fly-first-evtol-built-on-production-line/\"><em>TechCrunch</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/joby-aviations-first-production-air-taxi-cleared-for-flight-tests-093526681.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/joby-aviations-first-production-air-taxi-cleared-for-flight-tests-093526681.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-30T09:35:26+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Facebook may let EU users download apps directly from ads", "description": "<p>Meta is gearing up to debut a new type of Facebook ads that will allow users in the European Union to download apps without having to visit their mobile platform's app store, according to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/29/23778928/meta-eu-facebook-plans-app-install-android-ads\"><em>The Verge</em></a>. Yes, it will offer a direct download option for users, though the capability will likely debut only on Android, because the company is reportedly working with Android developers for its pilot launch later this year.&nbsp;</p><p>Android users can already install APKs and sideload apps they download through their browsers. However, those apps still use Google's billing system. Meta's alternative way to download apps is supposedly completely independent of both Apple's App Store and Google Play. It'll be possible to introduce such a feature in the EU due to a new law called the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/europe-digital-markets-act-005742387.html\">Digital Markets Act</a> (DMA), which will go into effect in 2024. Under the DMA's rules, consumers <a href=\"https://www.bruegel.org/blog-post/has-digital-markets-act-got-it-wrong-app-stores\">must be able to download</a> apps from competing app stores. &quot;When a gatekeeper engages in unfair practices, such as... preventing installation of applications from other sources, consumers are likely to pay more or are effectively deprived of the benefits that alternative services might have brought,&quot; the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_6423\">European Commission said</a>.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Tom Channick, a spokesperson for Meta, has confirmed the company's plan to introduce app downloads through Facebook ads to <em>The Verge</em>. &quot;We've always been interested in helping developers distribute their apps, and new options would add more competition in this space,&quot; he said. &quot;Developers deserve more ways to easily get their apps to the people that want them.&quot; We also reached out to Meta for confirmation and more details. Meta reportedly won't be taking a cut from developers' earnings and will allow them to use whatever billing system they want. For now, anyway. That could change as the service evolves, if it ever gets past the pilot testing phase.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/facebook-may-let-eu-users-download-apps-directly-from-ads-084313006.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/facebook-may-let-eu-users-download-apps-directly-from-ads-084313006.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-30T08:43:13+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "YouTube test threatens to block viewers if they continue using ad blockers", "description": "<p>YouTube is looking to take a more aggressive approach in preventing viewers from using ad blockers while watching videos on its platform. As <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/technology/youtube-tests-restricting-ad-blocker-users-to-3-video-views/\"><em>BleepingComputer</em></a> reports, people have been <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/14kmd07/youtube_cracking_down_on_if_youre_not_paying_them/\">posting</a> screenshots on social networks like Reddit that show a pop-up notice warning them that their player will be blocked after three videos.&nbsp;</p><p>The warning says YouTube will block their ability to play videos on the platform unless they disable their ad blocker or add the website to their white list. &quot;Ads allow YouTube to stay free for billions of users worldwide,&quot; the notice continues. To go ad-free, the company tells users to get a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/you-tube-premium-family-plan-now-costs-23-a-month-222050334.html\">YouTube Premium</a> subscription so &quot;creators can still get paid.&quot; Prior to these warnings, YouTube only showed popups to ad blocker users, reminding them that it's against the website's TOS. Eventually, it added a timer to the notices to ensure viewers take the time to read them.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The website has confirmed to <em>BleepingComputer</em> that the new alerts are part of an experiment. A spokesperson told the publication that YouTube is &quot;running a small experiment globally that urges viewers with ad blockers enabled to allow ads on YouTube or try YouTube Premium.&quot; They said that YouTube might temporarily disable playback &quot;[i]n extreme cases, where viewers continue their use of ad blockers.&quot; The spokesperson added that they will only disable playback &quot;if viewers ignore repeated requests to allow ads on YouTube,&quot; though it's unclear if that means YouTube won't automatically block playback after a viewer watches three videos and will give them more opportunities to comply.&nbsp;</p><p>At the moment, this new approach only affects a small number of users, and YouTube didn't say how many people and regions are part of the test. The website, which makes most of its money from ads, has seen its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/25/youtube-q1-2023/\">ad revenue decline</a> over the past three quarters, so we won't be surprised if this test expands to more users around the world should it turn out to be effective.&nbsp;</p><div id=\"e4f7acfa3598400984792d0cca3ca3fc\"><div class=\"iframely-embed\"><div class=\"iframely-responsive\" style=\"height: 500px; padding-bottom: 0;\"><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/14kmd07/youtube_cracking_down_on_if_youre_not_paying_them/\"></a></div></div></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/youtube-test-threatens-to-block-viewers-if-they-continue-using-ad-blockers-053117556.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/youtube-test-threatens-to-block-viewers-if-they-continue-using-ad-blockers-053117556.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-30T05:31:17+00:00", "persistent": false, "dead": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
