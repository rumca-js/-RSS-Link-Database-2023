And a lot of Spidey movies too, including Tom Holland\u2019s MCU version of the wallcrawler.\n\nSo with Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse out, we decided to\u00a0once again rank the Spider-Man movies -- and yes, that includes all the times he\u2019s hung out with the Avengers\u2026\u00a0Let\u2019s web this thing up!\n\nAs always, these rankings have been achieved by consulting with a group of spider-experts on the IGN staff, who voted on their best and worst Spider-Man movies. (And just a note: We're basing the ranking of the Avengers movies on the Spidey-centric portions of those films and how well they served him as a character, as well as how well he served those films!)\n\nSo who ranked where in our list of Spider Man movies from worst to best...? Let's start with... The Amazing Spider-Man 2, which is surely the worst Spidey movie of the group.\n\nWatch the video for our full ranking...\n\n#IGN #SpiderMan #Movies", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ_QK3OtFbk", "date_published": "2023-06-03 13:30:13+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Um... yeah.
