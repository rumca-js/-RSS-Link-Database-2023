<p>Nintendo is launching a sequel to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-02-08-nintendo-switch-minigames.html"><em>1-2 Switch</em></a>, its party title that features a robust collection of mini-games, on June 30th. It's called <em>Everybody 1-2-Switch!</em>, because you don't even need to use Joy-Cons to participate in some of its games — you can join in, as long as you're using a compatible smartphone. The original<em> 1-2 Switch</em> launched with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-02-13-nintendo-1-2-switch-hands-on.html">28 mini-games</a> meant to get people playing and to liven up get-togethers. Some of them were odd, such as the game where you have to get a crying baby to sleep, but some were oddly fun. There's a mini-game where you have to pretend to be sashaying down the runway like a supermodel, and another where you have to milk a cow.&nbsp;</p><p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.fanbyte.com/games/news/the-wild-story-behind-nintendos-unannounced-1-2-switch-sequel/"><em>Fanbyte</em></a> last year, Nintendo has been working on the sequel for quite some time. However, testing groups reportedly excoriated the game, and families with kids, which are Nintendo's prime reason for enabling matches with more than two participants, apparently found the mini-games boring. People were calling the sequel "Horseshit," the publication wrote, because the host is a person wearing a horse mask. Was Nintendo able to fix its issues and create mini-games entertaining enough to change the testers' minds? It's not quite clear. In fact, the official <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=21fc7c82-c5eb-49a9-b5d3-fc32a78290de&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Nintendo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyMWZjN2M4Mi1jNWViLTQ5YTktYjVkMy1mYzMyYTc4MjkwZGUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmludGVuZG8uY29tL3N0b3JlL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2V2ZXJ5Ym9keS0xLTItc3dpdGNoLXN3aXRjaC8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjAxMjA1NGZhLTFkYTctNDc5YS1iMWY2LWQ0NjA0ZWVlMWJmNSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQGKpZyJWcJD1zLUU4Db_3S6ij5ZK6uFzv0yjHz4vE4f&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Feverybody-1-2-switch-switch%2F">product page for Everybody 1-2-Switch!</a><em>&nbsp;</em>is pretty bare and mostly just mentions the game's multi-player capability.

<p>We've known <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-google-accounts-integration-084831995.html">it was coming</a> for quite some time, but now Google has a date for when it will start transitioning Fitbit users to Google logins. On June 6th, the tech giant will introduce the option for Fitbit users to log into their accounts using their Google credentials. When it announced the upcoming change following its $2.1 billion purchase of the wearable maker, the company said that it will enable the option for people to move their Fitbit device to their Google account when the log in support arrives. Users will have the opportunity to tweak their data when making the move and will have the option to manage their information either from the Fitbit app or from their Google settings page.&nbsp;</p><p>While logging into Fitbit with Google is only an option for now, soon users will have no choice. The company plans to require the use of a Google login to sign up for a new Fitbit account and to activate new sports devices and smartwatches sometime this year. And then by 2025, it will end support for Fitbit accounts altogether. Those planning to stick to the Fitbit brand will simply have to be OK with linking their devices to their Google account.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The tech giant is presenting the integration as an easy way for users to &quot;manage all [their] connected apps and paired devices.&quot; But it knows that some people will be concerned about the privacy of their information, so it <a href="https://blog.google/products/fitbit/google-accounts-for-fitbit/">previously said</a> that it won't be using Fitbit users' health and wellness data for Google Ads.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-users-can-log-in-with-their-google-accounts-starting-on-june-6th-173329923.html?src=rss

<p>Apparently, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-windows-copilot-ai-panos-panay-interview-150044298.html">introduction of Windows Copilot</a> signaled the end of Cortana on Microsoft's desktop OS. In a new <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=67071605-d4df-494e-8d9c-c9c236b8bb38&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Microsoft&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NzA3MTYwNS1kNGRmLTQ5NGUtOGQ5Yy1jOWMyMzZiOGJiMzgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9zdXBwb3J0Lm1pY3Jvc29mdC5jb20vZW4tdXMvdG9waWMvZW5kLW9mLXN1cHBvcnQtZm9yLWNvcnRhbmEtaW4td2luZG93cy1kMDI1YjM5Zi1lZTViLTQ4MzYtYTk1NC0wYWI2NDZlZTFlZmEiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImEzYjJmNWVjLTU5ZjQtNDlkYi1hYjI2LTcwYzg3NGFkYTZjZiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAYhabk4PVs7l6PKmiObU7YjB0-yk3C7gYriX4mSZFsmK&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Ftopic%2Fend-of-support-for-cortana-in-windows-d025b39f-ee5b-4836-a954-0ab646ee1efa">support document</a> first spotted by <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/microsoft-is-killing-cortana-on-windows-11-and-windows-10-later-this-year"><em>Windows Central</em></a>, the tech giant has announced that it will stop supporting the standalone Cortana app for Windows in late 2023. Microsoft <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-06-04-cortana-microsoft-windows-phone.html">launched</a> Cortana as a voice assistant for Windows mobile devices back in 2014. It was supposed to be the company's answer to Apple's Siri, and it even predates Amazon's Alexa, but it never quite achieved their level of recognition and popularity.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the year, Microsoft scaled back its plans for the voice assistant until it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cortana-shutdown-harman-kardon-invoke-ios-android-191700426.html">discontinued</a> its Android and iOS apps back in 2021. The company even removed it from partner manufacturers' devices, such as smart speakers. For Windows, in particular, Microsoft changed its status as a baked-in digital assistant and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-28-microsoft-cortana-separate-app.html">spun it out </a>into its own app for computers. That's the app we're bidding farewell to by the end of the year.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In its announcement, Microsoft pointed out that users will still have access to "powerful productivity features in Windows and Edge, which have increased AI capabilities." It specifically mentioned the new Bing that's now powered by OpenAI's GPT-4 technology. Microsoft introduced the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-365-copilot-uses-ai-to-automate-everyday-tasks-in-multiple-apps-151133434.html">Microsoft 365 Copilot</a> tool that can create content within Office apps with text-based prompts in March.&nbsp;</p><p>And then in late May, the company revealed at its Build developer conference that it's making AI a deeply integrated part of Windows 11 by putting a Copilot tool in the platform's sidebar. Users can ask it to perform tasks within the OS, such as changing the computer background, or even editing photos and summarizing documents, without having to launch apps or to search for particular settings. Most likely, very few people will be missing Cortana. Those that do use the assistant can transition to using Copilot, which will be available as a preview version for Windows 11 starting this month.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-is-killing-the-standalone-cortana-app-for-windows-in-late-2023-142437631.html?src=rss

## Even the cheapest Tesla Model 3 now qualifies for the full $7,500 tax credit

<p>If you're buying a Tesla Model 3 in the US, you can now get the maximum possible tax credit of $7,500 no matter what make you're getting. Tesla has <a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/incentives">updated its website</a> to show that the rear-wheel drive Model 3, along with its long range and performance counterparts, now qualify for the full federal tax credit for EVs. You'll also get to the enjoy the same amount of savings if you're buying the all-wheel, long-range or performance Model Y.&nbsp;</p><p>The US government <a href="https://www.engadget.com/stricter-guidance-means-fewer-evs-will-qualify-for-7500-federal-tax-credit-180350889.html">issued a revised set of</a> guidelines for which electric vehicles qualify for the federal $7,500 EV tax credit in March to comply with the Inflation Reduction Act rules the president signed last year. Under the new guidelines, which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/starting-tomorrow-only-six-evs-will-still-qualify-for-a-7500-federal-tax-credit-185304414.html">went into effect</a> on April 18th, vehicles using battery components that are 50 percent made or assembled in the US qualify for a tax credit of $3,750. They can only get the full $7,500 credit if their manufacturer sources at least 40 percent of their critical minerals from the US or its free trade partners, which don't include China.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A lot of EVs were kicked off the list of vehicles qualified for credits when the change was implemented, but <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vw-and-rivian-once-again-qualify-for-federal-ev-tax-credits-170656685.html">some were re-added</a> in the days that followed. You could only subtract $3,750 from your taxes for Tesla's rear-wheel drive and long range Model 3 due to the new guidelines, but that's no longer the case. It's not quite clear if Tesla altered the cars' batteries or found new suppliers to ensure that its new Model 3 deliveries meet the requirements for the new guidelines. But this means in some locations, you could get the standard version of the vehicle for just a bit more than $30,000 — or <a href="https://twitter.com/SawyerMerritt/status/1664723258627817478">maybe even less</a> than that if the state has its own perks for EVs.</p><div id="684a2f6ffa6444d9a29d8eb6a21a3fe2"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">BREAKING: <a href="https://twitter.com/Tesla?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Tesla</a> says ALL new Model 3 vehicles in the US now qualify for the full $7,500 EV tax credit, meaning the Model 3 now starts at $32,740 (with incentives). In some states, you can get it for under $30k.<br /><br />Before, the RWD and Long Range versions only qualified for $3,750. <a href="https://t.co/6K3aW60vse">pic.twitter.com/6K3aW60vse</a></p>— Sawyer Merritt (@SawyerMerritt) <a href="https://twitter.com/SawyerMerritt/status/1664723258627817478?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 2, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/even-the-cheapest-tesla-model-3-now-qualifies-for-the-full-7500-tax-credit-112145637.html?src=rss
