I am just as surprised as you are. Acknowledging my Tribal Chief's 1000 days as WWE champion took precedence. But President Ooops I Fell Down Again addressed the American people know he... signed a budget extension. That was it. That was the address. </p><p>Even CBS News had to roll its eyes. Joe Biden celebrating how he did the barest minimal.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">CBS News's Margaret Brennan: "Let's put this into perspective: this is the president taking a victory lap on being able to achieve a basic matter of governance." <a href="https://t.co/6HmLIPtuNa">pic.twitter.com/6HmLIPtuNa</a><br />— RNC Research (@RNCResearch) <a href="https://twitter.com/RNCResearch/status/1664775736262287360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 2, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>If you are that concerned with the details of the grand bargain, <a href="https://redstate.com/joesquire/2023/05/29/it-would-appear-kevin-mccarthy-somehow-did-worse-than-doing-nothing-at-all-on-the-debt-ceiling-n753096" target="_blank">here they are</a>. Ron DeSantis <a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/ron-desantis-debt-ceiling-new-hampshire/44069058" target="_blank">opposed the deal</a>. Donald Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/stillgray/status/1664136671238164481" target="_blank">said "Meh."</a> I lean towards "meh" because I find myself wondering why we even have a debt limit to begin with. The debt ceiling is supposed to be the limit of debt America takes on. Yet every time the debt ceiling comes up and conservatives say "Hey, maybe we should make cuts so we don't keep hitting our debt ceiling," it is vilified as extremism. And the debt ceiling always gets raised. So why bother? It's always been a piece of political theatre I don't have the bandwidth to get invested in.</p><p>But the REAL reason for the Oval Office address was so Biden could use it as part of his reelection campaign. You may not know this, but Biden is "running" for reelection. It's the only explanation why he wasted America's time to say "The only way American democracy can function is through compromise and consensus. And that is what I work to do as your president -- to forge bipartisan agreement where it is possible, and where it is needed."</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cBiden closes his Oval Office speech: "I know bipartisanship is hard, and unity is hard, but we can never stop trying."\u201d</div> — Aaron Rupar (@Aaron Rupar)

<p>Joe Biden in an Oval Office address about bipartisanship attacked the GOP. This is going to be his reelection message, talking out both sides of his mouth. Biden, who spent the last two years calling <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/extreme-rhetoric-democrats-2022" target="_blank">Republicans radical extremists</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jen-psaki-biden-partisan" target="_blank">literal Jim Crow raaaaaacists</a> for opposing him on anything is going to claim he is the only one who cares about unity and working together.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>And do I have to point out what the media reaction would be if Donald Trump used an Oval Office address to campaign for president? I feel like you know that I know that you know.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

	Ron DeSantis is running for president. Maxwell Frost is America's first zoomer congressman. Hayley Williams is both the lead singer of Paramore and someone who is determined to ruin music for me.

</p><p>
	Williams -- I didn't know Paramore was still together let alone touring -- <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/paramore-hayley-williams-ron-desantis_n_647511fee4b0b4444c7a84bc" target="_blank">discovered this week how easy it is to get media attention by attacking conservatives on stage</a>. To show how not scared she was to discuss politics, she told fans if they vote DeSantis they are dead to her. Last night Williams upped the ante in Washington DC by inviting Rep. Frost out.
</p><p>
	After claiming her audience is the future, Frost lashed out at his state's governor.
