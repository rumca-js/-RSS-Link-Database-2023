Reddit done goofed. Reverting on 15 years of developer and community goodwill, the company is now charging unsustainable prices for API access with an unrealistic implementation period. Apollo, and many other iOS/Android Reddit clients are at jeopardy of ceasing to exist within just a few weeks. I speak with Christian Selig (former Apple intern turned star indie dev) on why and how Apollo's $20M API maintenance fees are a no-go and how Reddit's changes will make the site worse for everyone.
