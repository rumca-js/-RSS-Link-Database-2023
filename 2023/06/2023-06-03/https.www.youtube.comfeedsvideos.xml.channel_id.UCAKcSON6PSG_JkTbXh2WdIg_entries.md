The Nude Party’s latest album, 'Rides On,' released on March 10 of this year. It’s the band’s third album, and the band have been busily touring in support of the album; in fact, they’ll be touring in Europe for most of June.

On April 16, The Nude Party played a show at the Turf Club in St. Paul, and the next day, they visited The Current studio to play four songs from the album. Afterwards, the band’s Patton Magee and Shaun Couture sat down with The Current’s Bill DeVille to chat about The Nude Party’s more than a decade of friendship and music-making; what it was like recording the album during a time when the band members were struck with COVID; and how they all got those awesome, embroidered denim suits.

Watch and listen to the entire session above.
