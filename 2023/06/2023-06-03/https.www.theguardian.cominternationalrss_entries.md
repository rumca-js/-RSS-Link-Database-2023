<p>With his loan spell over and unwanted by Atlético, the £113m prodigy dealing in cameos is still looking for his masterpiece</p><p></p><p>João Félix took Mykhaylo Mudryk’s volleyed pass in the centre circle and ran at the Manchester United defence. Raphaël Varane, unprotected by a central midfielder, backed off. With a slight feint, Félix had Varane shift his weight right when it needed to go left, glided into the space that opened up as a result and then drove his finish low from the edge of the box past David de Gea.</p><p>At a different time, in another context, it might have been regarded as a stunning goal, an intervention of the highest quality. Everything about it was precise and direct. But it was in the final minute <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/25/manchester-united-chelsea-premier-league-match-report" title="">of a 4-1 defeat</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jun/03/joao-felix-chelsea-misfit-atletico-madrid-what-next">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The humble marrowfat pea adds its superpower to the chunky puree at the heart of this satisfying pie </p><p>Who doesn’t love a good pie? When I was growing up in New Zealand, the choice available was generally limited to ones containing meat, or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/16/four-perfect-picnic-pie-recipes">the country’s classic bacon and egg pie</a>. Well, today’s recipe is none of the above. Instead, it features an ingredient I hadn’t even tried before I moved to London just over 18 years ago, namely marrowfat, or mushy, peas. It turns out they make the most sublime puree – in fact, I’d even go so far as to say they make a great alternative to avocado.</p><p>Chantelle Nicholson is chef/patron of <a href="https://www.apricityrestaurant.com/">Apricity</a>, London W1</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/03/pea-broad-bean-and-caramelised-onion-filo-pie-vegan-recipe-chantelle-nicholson">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A first-time NHL champion will be crowned when the Vegas Golden Knights meet the Florida Panthers starting on Saturday</p><p>In mid-December, Sergei Bobrovsky’s future with the Florida Panthers was the subject of serious debate. The $10m-per-year netminder was 5-8-1 with a .884 save percentage before Christmas. Spencer Knight, who signed a contract extension worth $4.5m a year in October, looked like the natural successor, so long as Florida could convince someone to take Bob off their hands this summer. But in February, Knight entered then NHL’s player assistance program with no timeline for his return. Bobrovsky was bumped back to first string, but struggled again. When an illness sidelined him in late March, Alex Lyon, called up from the AHL, stepped in, went on a tear, and started the playoffs against Boston.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/03/vegas-golden-knights-florida-panthers-stanley-cup-preview">Continue reading...</a>

## Euphoria review – Cate Blanchett voices a tiger in this visually beautiful takedown of capitalism, but where’s the fury?

<p><strong>Melbourne town hall, Rising festival</strong><br />Julian Rosefeldt’s magnificent and exhausting film, starring the Oscar winner and Giancarlo Esposito, reverts to evasive surrealist flourishes just as it threatens to become truly angry</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=cvau_sfl">Get our weekend culture and lifestyle email</a></li></ul><p>There is little to no nature in German artist and film-maker Julian Rosefeldt’s newest work, Euphoria, although there are plenty of animals. Sheep, white stallions, a moose, a camel and finally, voiced seductively by Cate Blanchett, a massive tiger stalking the aisles of an abandoned supermarket. Are they talismans or mute witnesses; mocking us or looking on with horror as we destroy the world?</p><p>Unlike Godfrey Reggio’s experimental documentary film Koyaanisqatsi, which pitted humanity’s ever increasing growth against the monumental power of nature, Rosefeldt depicts a world already unhinged from the natural, already in its death spiral to oblivion. And where Reggio allowed his images – tied unforgettably to Philip Glass’s pixellated tonal soundscapes – to do the work, Rosefeldt leans heavily, often exhaustingly, on the spoken word.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jun/03/euphoria-review-cate-blanchett-voices-a-tiger-in-this-visually-beautiful-takedown-of-capitalism-but-wheres-the-fury">Continue reading...</a>
