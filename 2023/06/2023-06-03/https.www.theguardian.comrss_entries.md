<p>If, as seems highly likely, this was farewell it was low key in nature. Ange Postecoglou refused to directly address the rising sense he will be named as Tottenham Hotspur’s new manager in the lead up to the Scottish Cup final. Celtic defeated Inverness Caledonian Thistle to ensure season two of Postecoglou’s reign delivered a domestic treble. Celtic remain Scottish football’s dominant force, with Postecoglou’s return a total of five trophies from a possible half dozen. He will argue he has done his bit. Celtic were in a state of disrepair when Postecoglou arrived.</p><p>The game will not live long in anybody’s memory. Celtic’s supporters, perhaps unsure how to handle the supposedly imminent departure of a manager they adore, were noticeably subdued. Postecoglou’s celebrations were not exactly wild either. There was also the underlying awareness that Inverness lacked the quality to punish slack moments in Celtic’s play, until the late goal which injected life into a pretty flat occasion. Jota pounced in stoppage time to allow the scoreline a more appropriate reflection of the game.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/03/celtic-inverness-scottish-cup-final-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

The lessons to be learned from the government’s mistakes in handling of the coronavirus are crucial. We need all the facts<p>If one clear lesson is to be taken from our response to the arrival of Covid-19 three years ago, it is an appreciation of the highly effective role played by scientists in fighting the pandemic. Within weeks of the Sars-CoV-2 virus emerging, researchers had sequenced every one of its genes and had pinpointed the cells through which Covid-19 enters the body. By the end of the year, they had used that knowledge to create a safe, tested vaccine that played a crucial role in ending the pandemic. More than 7 million people across the planet <a href="https://healthpolicy-watch.news/true-covid-19-death-toll-close-to-7-million-says-key-global-institute/" title="">have died of Covid-19</a> but the death toll would have been far higher had researchers not acted with such speed and potency.</p><p>Yet it is also becoming clear that on many occasions scientists were not listened to by national leaders. Economics and short-term political considerations were often given greater priority than scientific concerns. These resulted in failures to limit the spread of Covid-19. It is for this reason that the UK inquiry into the nation’s pandemic response, chaired by Heather Hallett, should be followed with rigorous attention.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/03/covid-science-clear-why-was-it-ignored">Continue reading...</a>

We communicated by email for this interview.</p><p><strong>There are plenty of vivid scenes in this collection — from a car crash to stealing tips from a nail salon for a “hit”. What was your approach to storytelling in </strong><em><strong>Time </strong></em><em><strong>Is a Mother</strong></em><strong>? <br /></strong>I’ve always believed, both in fiction and poetry, in Wallace Stevens’s ideal of imaginative writing coming from a “supreme fiction”. That is, that the poem is an opportunity to turn from memoiristic transcription of information towards a kind of ultimate artefact, charged and changed by the imagination. And it’s through this lens that I approach storytelling in my work. For example, I can’t drive – but the poem American Legend has a speaker driving his father to put down their dog, which becomes a kind of parable for American failure, the car crash the deliberate destruction of an iconic medium of mid-century autonomy and possibility, which liberates the relationship between father and son into a kind of “elsewhere,” or “no man’s land” of relation. What becomes of people, of the story, when its linear promise is elided, when we literally crash the car in hopes of finding another path? Writing from a memoiristic approach would be too limiting.</p><p><em>Time Is a Mother</em> is published in paperback by Jonathan Cape (£12).

The arson of a wooden statue of the former first lady has been seen as symbolic. My Slovenian hosts think differently<p>I spent last weekend in Ljubljana, where I was talking about comics at the invitation of Slovenia’s biggest publisher of graphic novels, VigeVageKnjige, and everything about it was delightful: the tarragon ice cream (no, really), the streetlights (mounted on Ionic pillars), the buildings designed by the great Jože Plečnik. But I was also struck by the number of American tourists in this lesser-known corner of Europe. Were they here to trace their roots? Or were they perhaps fans of the Slovenian basketball player and MBA star Luka Dončić?</p><p>There was, of course, a remote third possibility, which is that some were inspired by Melania Trump, who grew up in a town called Sevnica, and still has the accent to prove it. Over dinner, my hosts grimaced. They hoped fervently that this was not the case, but, since I was interested, had I seen the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/05/melania-trump-statue-slovenia-sevnica" title="">wooden statue of Melania</a>, crafted by a chainsaw, that was erected outside Sevnica in 2019, only to be burned down by arsonists soon afterwards? On her mobile, my host Zala produced a picture. “She looked like a Smurf,” she told me, and she was right. The Venus de Milo this was not. The man who commissioned it, Brad Downey, a Slovenian-American artist, has since exhibited the charred remains in the US. It seems <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/19/frustrations-at-us-policies-behind-melania-trump-statue-says-artist" title="">he regards them as a warning</a> of burgeoning political tensions in Slovenia – an interpretation somewhat at odds with the one offered to me over the coffee and baklava.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/03/what-draws-tourists-to-slovenia-surely-not-ill-fated-venus-de-melania">Continue reading...</a>

It feels so fun to express it two-dimensionally on paper.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2023/jun/03/everyday-art-painting-glass-eunkyoung-son-in-pictures">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The first Miles Morales animation was a sensation, but this second film, with fresh characters, writers and energy, goes above and beyond</p><p>Is it possible to equal a film as boundlessly inventive, stylistically bold and effortlessly cool as <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/16/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-review">Spider-Man: Into </a></em><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/16/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-review">the Spider-Verse</a></em>? Could a sequel ever match that film’s freshness, energy and visual verve? The answer, it seems, is an emphatic yes. <em>Spider-Man: Across </em><em>the Spider-Verse</em> is sublime. There’s not a frame of this rich, kaleidoscopically detailed animation that isn’t dazzling. It takes the basic themes of the first film – adolescent isolation, communication breakdown, the messy, stressful business of growing, of finding your people – and builds whole worlds with them. It’s a dizzying onslaught of ideas and graphic references. It has heart. It even has a font gag.</p><p>In the film-making team and in the story there’s a pleasing combination of original talent and fresh blood. Phil Lord and Christopher Miller return as writers and producers, but there’s a new directing team that includes Kemp Powers (Pixar’s <em>Soul</em>). Once again, the story focuses on the bond between fellow Spider-people Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) and Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld). But there is a host of new characters, each with their own distinctive look, including Hobie (Daniel Kaluuya), a spider-punk anarchist, drawn with a graphic style that borrows from Jamie Reid’s Sex Pistols aesthetic and Jamie Hewlett’s Gorillaz.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/03/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-review-a-dizzying-dazzling-sequel">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Murrayfield Stadium, Edinburgh</strong><br />In a typically breathless three-hour set, the Boss and band deliver the goods with such joy and passion, there’s little option other than to succumb</p><p>“As you get older,” notes Bruce Springsteen wryly, “death gives you pause to think.” The singer and his 17-strong band are being held briefly at the halfway mark of a nearly three-hour set that segues fluidly from song to song, rarely pausing for breath – just a “one, two, three, four!” from Springsteen, before powering up again.</p><p>We’ve reached the part where he recalls joining his first band in the mid-60s and how, 50 years later, he found himself at the deathbed of <a href="https://eu.app.com/story/entertainment/music/2018/07/16/george-theiss-bruce-springsteens-bandmate-castiles-has-died/789383002/">George Theiss</a>, who had hired the teenage guitarist into the Castiles. You could hear a plastic half-pint cup drop in the 60,000 capacity stadium, bathing in unfamiliar late evening Scottish sunshine. “And death’s final and lasting gift to the living,” Springsteen intones, as though trading elevated oratory with his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/feb/27/today-in-focus-freshwater-cold-case-cuts-renegades-born-in-the-usa-obama-springsteen-between-the-ears-concrete-paris-space-1999-southwark-playhouse-elders-sour-hall">podcast buddy</a>, former president Barack Obama, “is an expanded vision of<em> this</em> life.” Naturally, Springsteen urges us to “seize the day”. Then he launches into <a href="https://youtu.be/YE6l-_g814I">Last Man Standing</a>, from his 2020 LP <em>Letter </em><em>to You</em> – a song about the loneliness of outliving all of your comrades, and the transformative powers of rock’n’roll.

Such adventures often lead to inevitable sogginess or clamminess, but I enjoy both for the rare chance to go feral, with the smell of smoke clinging to my damp jeans and my hair volumised with bacon fat.

<p><strong>Grand theatre, Leeds; Wigmore Hall, London</strong><br />Sorrowful Mozart meets unstoppable Neo Muyanga in an inspired double bill from Opera North and Phoenix Dance Theatre. Plus, the sounds of Yiddish cabaret…</p><p>What does an audience want? No one can answer that fugitive question with certainty. All the bells and whistles of data research may help, but the only reliable tool is trust built up over decades. Opera North has learned this. Few would have predicted that bonding Italian baroque music to Indian classical, as the company did last year with <em>Orpheus</em>, would prove <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/oct/22/orpheus-opera-north-leeds-review-apartment-house-wigmore-hall-jakub-hrusa-royal-opera">a perfect fit</a>. Now they have paired Mozart’s Requiem with an uplifting, rhythmic world premiere, <em>After Tears</em>, by the Soweto-born composer Neo Muyanga (b.1974), setting two dance companies loose to express the music’s contrasting moods in twirls, lifts and stomps of every kind. “Smashed it mate,” noted a tweeter straight after opening night. They had.</p><p>The link between the two works was grief. (The UK opera season so far, the fruits of lockdown, has not stinted on melancholy.) Calling the double bill <em><a href="https://www.operanorth.co.uk/news/requiem-journeys-of-the-soul-for-leeds-2023/">Requiem: Journeys of the Soul</a></em>, Opera North united the company’s chorus and orchestra with the Leeds-based contemporary dance company <a href="https://www.phoenixdancetheatre.co.uk/">Phoenix Dance Theatre</a> and Cape Town’s <a href="https://www.jazzart.co.za/about-us/#history">Jazzart Dance Theatre</a>, in harness with <a href="https://capetownopera.co.za/about-us/">Cape Town Opera</a>.

<p>Wilson and the BBC Philharmonic mine more gems by the neglected British composer; the English Concert and a stellar cast excel in Handel’s opera seria; and Bridcut gets to the heart of Michael Tippett</p><p>• The triumph as well as the sorrow of Eric Coates (1886-1957) is that his music is familiar – his By the Sleepy Lagoon is used as the <em>Desert Island Discs</em> theme – but few know his name or what else he wrote. His wistful, elegant orchestral writing, full of yearning oboe melodies, uplifting brass fanfares, foot-tapping string tunes, is the epitome of that neglected category: “British light music”. The conductor <strong>John Wilson</strong>, a dazzling champion of this repertoire, indifferent to fashion but now leading it, has made us listen again.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.chandos.net/products/catalogue/CHAN%2020164">Eric Coates: Orchestral Works Volume 3</a></strong> (Chandos), played by the <strong>BBC Philharmonic</strong>, includes the evocative <em>Cinderella</em>, the well-known Dam Busters March and <em>The Three Elizabeth</em><em>s</em> (1944) – celebrating Queen Elizabeth I, Elizabeth of Glamis and Princess Elizabeth (as she was at the time).

 - [https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/03/20-years-of-podcasting](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/03/20-years-of-podcasting)

<p>Since the first podcast was released two decades ago this month, the medium has upended pop culture in countless unexpected ways, from revolutionising standup comedy to providing storytelling fuel for drama and documentary</p><p>Do you remember life before podcasts? Yes, obviously, is likely to be the short answer. Podcasting is still a relatively youthful medium, after all. In fact, it is exactly 20 years this month since the format’s invention: Open Source – a politics and culture discussion show hosted by the journalist Christopher Lydon – debuted in the summer of 2003, and is widely considered the first ever podcast. (Not that it was actually called podcasting at that point; the term was coined the following year by Ben Hammersley in an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/feb/12/broadcasting.digitalmedia" title="">article</a> for the Guardian.)</p><p>Yet if you are one of the approximately 20 million people in the UK who listen to podcasts – and especially if you’re a heavy user like me (I listen while I am cleaning, cooking, eating, walking, on the bus, having a bath – essentially anything that doesn’t engage my word brain) – the art form will have subtly but comprehensively changed the flavour of your everyday life. For many of us, podcasts have become constant companions, fostering parasocial relationships, exposing us to candid conversations and unearthing thrilling, sometimes salacious stories.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/03/20-years-of-podcasting">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The American author talks about growing up queer in a family of ‘wolves’, poverty and class in the US, and the 19th-century writers who inspired his latest novel</p><p>Brandon Taylor writes quickly. “I can type almost as fast as I can think,” he says. The first draft of his debut novel, the Booker-shortlisted <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/17/real-life-by-brandon-taylor-review-a-brilliant-debut" title="">Real Life</a>, took him five weeks; last June he challenged a writer friend to a race. The friend had been 30,000 words ahead on his book, with Taylor going from a standing start, but by August, Taylor had finished, while his friend was still ploughing on.</p><p>Since Taylor says that “everybody in my family dies young”, one might assume that this is a rush to seize the day. But writing, he says, is also “the most fun I’m capable of having”. When he discovered the internet aged 12, via his parents’ dial-up modem in rural Alabama (the web being “this beautiful land that I could only visit temporarily because somebody wouldn’t pay the phone bill”), Taylor used to produce 8,000 words a day, writing five collaborative stories at once on roleplay forums. “That was good training for having stamina as a writer,” he explains, a genial 34-year-old in a blue denim shirt sitting at a table in the Guardian’s London offices. “As long as I have a good sense of scene or character, when I get a good first line there is nothing standing between me and the end.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/03/brandon-taylor-writing-is-the-most-fun-im-capable-of-having">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Defender planted olive trees to compensate for emissions from his Watford to Salernitana loan and wants football to educate and act</p><p>This month, on 14 June to be precise, the summer transfer window opens. It is not usually the prompt for a footballer to visit an orchard.

<p>Self-help shelves are filled with guides to surviving midlife, but where is the fiction? Lisa Allardice talks to Marian Keyes, Joanne Harris and others about ‘hot-flush lit’</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/joanne-harris" title="">Joanne Harris</a> was rereading Carrie by Stephen King during lockdown when she got the inspiration for her new novel, Broken Light. The novelist had recently been diagnosed with breast cancer and King’s horror story was all her “chemo-brain” could cope with, she says on a video call from her home in Yorkshire. The story of a girl who gets telekinetic powers at puberty, Carrie was a favourite for Harris growing up. “Of course it was!” she exclaims. “It’s all about the drama of adolescence and the horror of having a changing body that does unpredictable stuff.”</p><p>Reading it again in her 50s she was struck by the idea: “What if Carrie had lived and her powers had kicked in at menopause instead? Nobody wants to give superpowers to a teenager, because of course they’re going to burn everything down.” And so she created Bernie Moon, who in middle age discovers she is able to inhabit other people’s minds and set them on a different course – predatory men become a particular target. “It’s menopausal Carrie,” she says gleefully. She started writing when she was ill (the effects of chemotherapy “were like the menopause but worse,” she says) and didn’t stop. She got the all-clear this Christmas: “So I thought: ‘OK, I’m feeling good about this.’”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/03/all-the-rage-the-rise-of-the-menopause-novel">Continue reading...</a>

It’s a ruse, though. There are rules! Especially when it comes to the food. Rule number one: think about logistics – if your quiche is travelling, give it an extra 10 minutes in the oven, because a soft set won’t end well. Rule two: don’t assemble anything leafy or herby until your rug is laid out, because wilted leaves and herbs are a sorry sight. And rule three: if you’re in a crowd, don’t be shy about making a plan – there are only so many crusty baguettes and pots of hummus that any group can eat.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/03/picnic-and-camping-recipes-yotam-ottolenghi">Continue reading...</a>

Here, not sticking to sport is cause for commendation, not criticism, still less punishment. “A lot of people <em>like</em> footballers having a voice, using their platform; when they don’t, it’s often because they disagree with the opinion,” he says, as the city speeds by. “It’s interesting to be in Italy for this, with the government they have now.” There’s a pause, a laugh. “I doubt they know about it. It’s a nice gesture. I’m sure the recent furore brought me here.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/03/gary-lineker-match-of-the-day-saga-was-surreal-i-just-want-compassion">Continue reading...</a>

## I love electric vehicles – and was an early adopter. But increasingly I feel duped | Rowan Atkinson

<p>Sadly, keeping your old petrol car may be better than buying an EV. There are sound environmental reasons not to jump just yet</p><p>Electric motoring is, in theory, a subject about which I should know something. My first university degree was in electrical and electronic engineering, with a subsequent master’s in control systems. Combine this, perhaps surprising, academic pathway with a lifelong passion for the motorcar, and you can see why I was drawn into an early adoption of electric vehicles. I bought my first electric hybrid 18 years ago and my first pure electric car nine years ago and (notwithstanding our poor electric charging infrastructure) have enjoyed my time with both very much. Electric vehicles may be a bit soulless, but they’re wonderful mechanisms: fast, quiet and, until recently, very cheap to run. But increasingly, I feel a little duped. When you start to drill into the facts, electric motoring doesn’t seem to be quite the environmental panacea it is claimed to be.</p><p>As you may know, the government has proposed a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/18/uk-ban-on-new-fossil-fuel-vehicles-by-2030-not-enough-to-hit-climate-targets">ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars</a> from 2030. The problem with the initiative is that it seems to be based on conclusions drawn from only one part of a car’s operating life: what comes out of the exhaust pipe. Electric cars, of course, have zero exhaust emissions, which is a welcome development, particularly in respect of the air quality in city centres. But if you zoom out a bit and look at a bigger picture that includes the car’s manufacture, the situation is very different. In advance of the Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow in 2021, Volvo released figures claiming that greenhouse gas emissions during production of an electric car are<a href="https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/cars/article-10161697/Volvo-says-electric-car-making-emissions-70-HIGHER-petrol.html"> 70% higher</a> than when manufacturing a petrol one. How so? The problem lies with the lithium-ion batteries fitted currently to nearly all electric vehicles: they’re absurdly heavy, many rare earth metals and huge amounts of energy are required to make them, and they only last about 10 years. It seems a perverse choice of hardware with which to lead the automobile’s fight against the climate crisis.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/03/electric-vehicles-early-adopter-petrol-car-ev-environment-rowan-atkinson">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This epic political novel traces the country from Japanese occupation through partition, as experienced by a family of railway workers</p><p>A rusting, bullet-riddled locomotive in the demilitarised zone that slices through the Korean peninsula gives this marvellous epic novel its enigmatic title. Captured during the Korean war of the early 1950s, the immobilised train pointing North has become a famous symbol of the frustrated yearning for reunification, a “commemorative fossil of the age of division”. The train is an underlying motif within Hwang Sok-yong’s mature masterpiece, a worker’s-eye view of the 20th-century history surrounding Korea’s partition, which draws deeply on his personal experience of labour and pro-democracy movements and his five-year stint in prison for breaching South Korean security laws by visiting the North in 1989.</p><p>Originally published in Korean in 2020, Mater 2-10 opens in the 21st century with a laid-off factory worker, Yi Jino, staging a vertiginous “sit-in” on the catwalk round an industrial chimney. In a mountaineering tent overlooking railway tracks, his sky-high protest stretches beyond a year, while far below workers prostrate themselves in solidarity.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/03/mater-2-10-by-hwang-sok-yong-review-a-masterpiece-of-korean-history">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Motoring insiders tell us which models to choose, based on price, reliability, running costs and more</p><p>If you are one of those people who views the prospect of buying a car with a mixture of fear and resentment, then help is at hand. This week, Guardian Money has been asking some of the UK’s car experts which vehicle they would buy for themselves if they were spending their own money.</p><p>The UK’s cheapest brand-new cars include the Dacia Sandero, the MG3, the Kia Picanto and the Citroën C3, all of which can be picked up for a shade under £14,000. With this in mind, we asked our experts what they would buy with a £14,000 budget. Would they opt for one of those four, a different make, or a better-value used option?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jun/03/uk-car-buying-expert-tips-budget-price-reliability">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Buy that sous vide machine! Get good at plating! In three years’ time, maybe this show will be yours for the winning (if you want Michel Roux as a boss, that is)</p><p>What percentage of the public harbours dreams of being a cooking professional? It must be at 10%, 11%. Every day you are surrounded by them. Perhaps you work with a guy who is too into fermentation. A distant cousin spends every weekend laminating dough. How many people in your household dream of retiring at 50 and opening a gastropub? One? Two? Three? A stark fact: no one in this country doesn’t know someone who secretly harbours dreams of making something complex with hickory smoke for a table of three judges. And so, to try to meet that insatiable demand – Five Star Kitchen: Britain’s Next Great Chef (from Thursday), which is MasterChef but for Channel 4.</p><p>Well, it isn’t just MasterChef for Channel 4. It’s MasterChef: The Professionals – every participant in this knock-out hour-long cooking format is already working as a chef, be it private or restaurant owner – with a healthy dose of The Apprentice also (each contestant has to rock up to the show with a neat “restaurant concept” pitch: this isn’t just crab legs, it’s business too!). The prize is a restaurant inside the gilded Langham hotel in central London. The punishment is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/michel-roux-jr">Michel Roux Jr</a> will be your boss. To succeed you have to get through a series of challenges that mostly involve cooking breakfast to an unfeasibly high standard while someone shouts at you. This is TV that I watch and go: “I feel hungry. I’m going to have to have a snack.” But a broad segment of the population will watch this and go: “I’m going to finally buy that sous vide machine and get good at plating. In three years’ time I could win this.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/03/five-star-kitchen-this-cookery-competition-may-be-your-chance-to-finally-open-that-restaurant">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When Joanna Biggs split up with her husband, she stepped off a conventional path into what seemed like chaos. Could books and art guide her to an alternative happy ending?</p><p>There are many things I didn’t do when I got divorced seven years ago at the age of 34: I didn’t set up a divorce registry; I didn’t throw my arms out behind me like wings while walking across a car park; I didn’t send an announcement that I was consciously uncoupling with a picture of me and my ex sitting on a lawn in happier times; I didn’t throw a party; I didn’t order a cake iced with “Boy, bye”; I didn’t erase all traces of my married life, burn love letters or throw my rings into the sea.</p><p>I don’t disapprove of these things – I laughed out loud when I came across the “Boy, bye” cake online recently, and if a paparazzo had cared he could have caught me dancing down the road that first divorcee summer – but what I most remember about that time was a feeling of plotlessness. I had chosen to come off the conventional path. What next? Not this, I kept saying, working my way slowly and haphazardly towards the things that did feel right. One of the first of those things was selling my wedding dress. I had felt beautiful in it, and though I didn’t want to wear it again, it wasn’t because it felt cursed. I could let it go. I feel happy when I think of someone else unknowingly giving that gown new life. I bought a new dress in silk jersey, covered in poppies, primroses and blue hydrangeas.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/03/post-marriage-i-was-a-teenager-again-how-i-turned-the-page-after-getting-divorced-in-my-30s">Continue reading...</a>

<p>On a walking tour of this sparkling archipelago, <em>Raynor Winn</em> is transfixed by the views and the ‘otherness’</p><p>The morning had the bright clarity of perfect light, framing the landscape in stark relief against a clear blue sky. It was too perfect, one of those mornings that would soon be lost to rain. But as I looked out from the granite cliffs of Land’s End, I could see stark shapes interrupting the horizon between sea and sky. That was the first time I saw the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/scilly" title="">Isles of Scilly</a>, tiny black specks in the Celtic Sea, at the vast blue edge of the Atlantic Ocean. They disappeared into the rain of the day and I never saw them again. Not until today.</p><p>It has been 10 years since we walked the <a href="https://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/en_GB/trails/south-west-coast-path/" title="">South West Coast Path</a>. Ten years since that first sighting of Scilly, but it’s only now that we are finally leaving Land’s End, watching that familiar coastline grow smaller – me and my husband – heading to an unknown land and unwalked paths. But as we step on to St Mary’s, I begin to understand these islands aren’t so unfamiliar. The blocky granite stacks along the coastline of Scilly’s largest island echo those that surround the western tip of Cornwall. This outcrop of islands might be separated from the mainland by 28 miles of sea, but it’s firmly connected by granite.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/jun/03/walking-holiday-on-the-scilly-isles-cornwall">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Violence, homophobia, racism and sexism make many fans at away games feel unsafe – and clubs aren’t doing enough to help</p><p>Ask anyone what they enjoy about attending professional women’s football and the answers will be similar: they are reeled in not only by the quality but the atmosphere, friendliness and inclusivity. With the women’s game growing, the toxicity around men’s football, especially for travelling supporters, is an even more glaring contrast. As the season ends, the <em>Guardian</em> spoke to fans of clubs across the Premier League and EFL who reported offensive chants, language, behaviour and sexual assaults. For women, families, black, Asian and minority ethnic and LGBTQ+ fans, following their team on the road can be difficult and uncomfortable.</p><p>One female supporter spoke of experiencing sexual assaults regularly when following her team and going to other games with friends. “I’ve normalised it,” she said. “You’d think I’d turn around and call them out, but I didn’t. Last time, it was only [when] walking back to the car I said to my husband: ‘Oh yeah, that’s happened again.’ I should have been more horrified, but it happens all the time, particularly at away games where people have been drinking all day. They think that’s acceptable. I don’t accept that.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jun/03/women-are-expected-to-put-up-and-shut-up-the-toxicity-of-attending-mens-football">Continue reading...</a>

Thick end of pork belly is one of my family’s favourite roasting joints, with a strong ratio of crackling to meat; the meat itself is super-rich and fatty, so even a small portion satiates. The leftovers are delicious cold, and even just a couple of tablespoons can be turned into fancy sliders. If you are lucky enough to have any crackling left over, too, chop it up finely and turn that crisp goodness through the pulled meat.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/03/how-to-turn-leftover-roast-pork-into-a-delicious-slider-recipe-zero-waste-cooking">Continue reading...</a>
