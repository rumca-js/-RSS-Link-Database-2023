Hello guys and gals, it's me Mutahar again! This time we take a look at AI Spongebob, a TV show being livestreamed on YouTube written, produced and acted entirely by AI tools. It's a wild ride and I'm waiting until it eventually gets wiped for being too risque. It's not the only AI meme floating around since other famous animated characters are getting some new life brought in. Thanks for watching!
