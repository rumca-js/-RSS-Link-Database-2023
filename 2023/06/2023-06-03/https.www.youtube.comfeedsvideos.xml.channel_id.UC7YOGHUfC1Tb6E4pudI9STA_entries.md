RARBG recently announced that they are shutting down, they gave a number of reasons on their website such as increased hosting fees, the war in Ukraine, and losing employees to the pandemic, but I think the recent pressure from the US on Bulgaria to stop internet copyright infringement and online piracy also plays a significant role in the site shutting down.
