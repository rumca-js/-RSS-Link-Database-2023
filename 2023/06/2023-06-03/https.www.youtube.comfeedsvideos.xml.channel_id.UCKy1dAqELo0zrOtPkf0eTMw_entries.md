Check out the trailer for Resurrecting Aerith: The Final Fantasy 7 Fans Who Re-Wrote Fate. Coming on June 10 only on IGN.

If you know one thing about Final Fantasy 7, it’s that Aerith dies. There’s a reason why this pivotal story beat is one of the most well-known spoilers in gaming: it’s a moment that’s continually stunned players since 1997. 

Over 25 years, rumour became myth, myth became hoax, and eventually hope became a way to genuinely save the flower girl from Midgar. This is the inside story of the players who re-wrote fate and resurrected Aerith Gainsborough.

Since Spider-Man made his big-screen debut in 2002, there have been a lot of Spideys! And a lot of Spidey movies too, including Tom Holland’s MCU version of the wallcrawler.

So with Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse out, we decided to once again rank the Spider-Man movies -- and yes, that includes all the times he’s hung out with the Avengers… Let’s web this thing up!

As always, these rankings have been achieved by consulting with a group of spider-experts on the IGN staff, who voted on their best and worst Spider-Man movies. (And just a note: We're basing the ranking of the Avengers movies on the Spidey-centric portions of those films and how well they served him as a character, as well as how well he served those films!)

So who ranked where in our list of Spider Man movies from worst to best...? Let's start with... The Amazing Spider-Man 2, which is surely the worst Spidey movie of the group.

Watch the video for our full ranking...
