<p>Just saw a few creators building better UI versions of HN.<p>I realize now, that one of the important factors that keep HN's audience selective is its simple UI.<p>IMO if we put the design and UI/UX elements of modern social platforms, it may start to attract a wider audience which certainly is not the intent of this platform.</p>

## Ask HN: What’s the deal with random people sending me money over PayPal?

<p>From time to time I get emails from PayPal stating that someone sent me a small amount of money (always an odd number, between 5 and 21 Euro), and that I should register to claim this amount.<p>It is obviously a scam, because<p>- I don’t know the senders<p>- It’s to an email address I no longer use and that gets spammed frequently<p>- It’s from a PayPal affiliate in the country of the email domain (I no longer live there)<p>What is the game here? Is it to confirm my email address is real? Will they claim the money back? Or would I become a money laundering mule when they ask me to send the money back to a different account? I just can’t come up with anything that sounds remotely profitable to me.</p>

## Meticulous (YC S21) Is Hiring Founding Engineer to Build AI for UI Testing
 - [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36178320](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36178320)

<p>Hey HN!<p>I'm Gabriel, CEO and co-founder of Meticulous.<p>Our mission is to radically accelerate the pace of software development for every company in the world. We're starting with a tool to catch UI bugs in web applications with zero-effort from developers.<p>How it works: Insert a single line of JavaScript onto your site, and we record thousands of real user sessions. We then replay these sessions on head and base commits of PRs, take screenshots at key points, and diff those screenshots to catch visual regressions before they hit production. We employ novel techniques to eliminate flakes. You can watch a 60-second demo at [meticulous.ai](<a href="http://meticulous.ai/">http://meticulous.ai/</a>).<p>We are a London-based YC company. Our engineering team previously worked at Dropbox, Opendoor, Palantir and Google, and have previously led 100+ engineer organizations at these companies. We raised $4m and are backed by some of the best founders and technical leaders in Silicon Valley, including Guillermo Rauch (founder Vercel, author next.js), Jason Warner (CTO GitHub), Scott Belsky (CPO Adobe), Calvin French-Owen (founder Segment), Jared Friedman (YC partner and former CTO of Scribd) and a bunch of other incredible folks.<p>Catching visual regressions is just the start. There is an entire category of products to build on top of replay. This ranges from catching exceptions to revealing the performance impact of frontend code.<p>We want to change the way the world develops software, and influence software approaches for decades to come.<p>We are seeding a London office and hiring an onsite founding engineer to join our team of four. We sponsor visas.<p>You will have autonomy in building out this technology, but here are a few problems you might work on:<p>- Build a distributed system to concurrently replay thousands of sessions, such that a developer gets a result in seconds.<p>- Speed up the replay of sessions in a way that retains determinism.<p>- Derive algorithms to detect sessions that cover differing code paths and edge cases, and ignore sessions that are too similar.<p>- Help build out a team of world-class, highly collaborative, software engineers.<p>As founding engineer, you get to shape the company, and build the culture and technology from the ground up.<p>What we look for:<p>In a sentence: Technically brilliant, delightful to work with, combined with a self-awareness and strong desire to improve. We also want to make sure everyone is highly supportive of each other; we win as a team.<p>We're currently only looking to bring on folks with senior level skill sets and 5+ years of industry experience. You should have strong web fundamentals and a deep love for software engineering. Maybe you enjoy programming books like Clean Code, Designing Data Intensive Applications, Pragmatic Programmer etc. or enjoy hacking on interesting side projects. You value transparency and candid feedback, and are motivated by a strong desire to become the best engineer you can be.<p>You can read about our values here <a href="https://ruby-wish-a8f.notion.site/Mission-Values-979c32ec58e74856af02da2e59c9f64d" rel="nofollow">https://ruby-wish-a8f.notion.site/Mission-Values-979c32ec58e...</a><p>You will be given the space and time to up-level yourself as an engineer in terms of conferences, reading, or whatever you think will be most valuable. We will also set you up with mentorship, if you desire it, from top engineering leaders (folks running 100-engineer organizations at the world's leading tech companies).<p>You’ll get to work alongside some of the best engineers there are, break new ground solving truly novel CS problems and deliver something that transforms how software is built.<p>If this sounds interesting, please reach out to me at gabe [at] meticulous [dot] ai with “HN” in the subject line and 2-3 sentences about what you find interesting about Meticulous and your resume/LinkedIn/GitHub.</p>

## Ask HN: Did Anyone Else Here Simply Not Do Well at School?

<p>Despite being a smart person, I've never been the kind of A type personality who does well at school. The environment just doesn't suit me. I don't know why. I've been told I have ADHD, but I do fine and manage time well when I'm in an actual job setting with stakes.<p>I'm in college now and have just been told I won't be receiving my CS degree. I came in as an English major because my grades weren't good enough to enter the competitive CS program at my school, so I just took CS courses on override. But here too, my grades were not good enough and I won't be allowed to transfer into the major. I'll have to settle for an informatics degree, and after graduation get a CS degree from WGU or something like that.<p>I suppose I'm looking for validation from anybody else who had a tortured academic path. I'm a little sick of being told I am not good enough because I don't meet the metrics.</p>

## Ask HN: How much of unlimited PTO do you use?

<p>If you have unlimited PTO how much of it do you actually use? I can see how unlimited PTO can work if you are working on projects - you take time off between projects. But what if you are a team lead or if your job is infrastructure related? Do you have a team mate that covers for you and then you cover some other person when needed?</p>

<p>I was reading some of the comments in this submission about attackers trying to brute force ssh credentials.<p>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36169954<p>In the comments fellow HN'ers were discussing the possibilities of XSS attacks using the password.<p>This had me thinking, have there actually been such <i>successful</i> attacks in your experience and how regular are they? Think of some kind of ridiculous XSS using  or anything similar.<p>Are these still <i>successfully</i> happening in 2023?</p>
