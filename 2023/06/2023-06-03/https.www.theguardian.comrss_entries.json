What was your approach to storytelling in </strong><em><strong>Time </strong></em><em><strong>Is a Mother</strong></em><strong>? <br /></strong>I\u2019ve always believed, both in fiction and poetry, in Wallace Stevens\u2019s ideal of imaginative writing coming from a \u201csupreme fiction\u201d. That is, that the poem is an opportunity to turn from memoiristic transcription of information towards a kind of ultimate artefact, charged and changed by the imagination. And it\u2019s through this lens that I approach storytelling in my work. For example, I can\u2019t drive \u2013 but the poem American Legend has a speaker driving his father to put down their dog, which becomes a kind of parable for American failure, the car crash the deliberate destruction of an iconic medium of mid-century autonomy and possibility, which liberates the relationship between father and son into a kind of \u201celsewhere,\u201d or \u201cno man\u2019s land\u201d of relation. What becomes of people, of the story, when its linear promise is elided, when we literally crash the car in hopes of finding another path? Writing from a memoiristic approach would be too limiting.</p><p><em>Time Is a Mother</em> is published in paperback by Jonathan Cape (\u00a312).

But increasingly I feel duped | Rowan Atkinson", "description": "<p>Sadly, keeping your old petrol car may be better than buying an EV. There are sound environmental reasons not to jump just yet</p><p>Electric motoring is, in theory, a subject about which I should know something. My first university degree was in electrical and electronic engineering, with a subsequent master\u2019s in control systems. Combine this, perhaps surprising, academic pathway with a lifelong passion for the motorcar, and you can see why I was drawn into an early adoption of electric vehicles. I bought my first electric hybrid 18 years ago and my first pure electric car nine years ago and (notwithstanding our poor electric charging infrastructure) have enjoyed my time with both very much. Electric vehicles may be a bit soulless, but they\u2019re wonderful mechanisms: fast, quiet and, until recently, very cheap to run. But increasingly, I feel a little duped. When you start to drill into the facts, electric motoring doesn\u2019t seem to be quite the environmental panacea it is claimed to be.</p><p>As you may know, the government has proposed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/18/uk-ban-on-new-fossil-fuel-vehicles-by-2030-not-enough-to-hit-climate-targets\">ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars</a> from 2030. The problem with the initiative is that it seems to be based on conclusions drawn from only one part of a car\u2019s operating life: what comes out of the exhaust pipe. Electric cars, of course, have zero exhaust emissions, which is a welcome development, particularly in respect of the air quality in city centres. But if you zoom out a bit and look at a bigger picture that includes the car\u2019s manufacture, the situation is very different. In advance of the Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow in 2021, Volvo released figures claiming that greenhouse gas emissions during production of an electric car are<a href=\"https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/cars/article-10161697/Volvo-says-electric-car-making-emissions-70-HIGHER-petrol.html\"> 70% higher</a> than when manufacturing a petrol one. How so? The problem lies with the lithium-ion batteries fitted currently to nearly all electric vehicles: they\u2019re absurdly heavy, many rare earth metals and huge amounts of energy are required to make them, and they only last about 10 years. It seems a perverse choice of hardware with which to lead the automobile\u2019s fight against the climate crisis.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/03/electric-vehicles-early-adopter-petrol-car-ev-environment-rowan-atkinson\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/03/electric-vehicles-early-adopter-petrol-car-ev-environment-rowan-atkinson", "date_published": "2023-06-03 07:00:24+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Manchester United yearn for payback in bid to ruin Guardiola\u2019s treble target | David Hytner", "description": "<p>The first all-Manchester FA Cup final is framed by City\u2019s pursuit of total supremacy and opponents\u2019 quest to avenge humiliation</p><p>It was a small and inconsequential moment but one that said plenty about a mood and a rivalry.
