SNL alumni Rob Schneider has three simple words of advice for the alter-ego of Chris Gaines: \"Just shut up.\"</p><p>The drama started when Garth was <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/music/country/garth-brooks-country-live-panel-nashville-interview-melinda-newman-1235348128/\" target=\"_blank\">doing an interview with Billboard</a> about his new Nashville restaurant, the Friends In Low Places Bar & Honky Tonk. The little he knew about the Bud Light drama was clear in his comments: \"And yes, we\u2019re going to serve every brand of beer. We just are. [...] If you\u2019re an a**hole, there are plenty of other places on lower Broadway.\"</p><p>The millions and millions of Americans who have made it so Bud Light is no longer the #1 beer in America, many of whom are country music fans, didn't take kindly to being called a**holes. Garth <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/garth-brooks-addresses-stir-saying-bar-will-serve-bud-light-rcna88989\" target=\"_blank\">tried a more measured political response</a>: \"Everybody\u2019s got their opinions. I think diversity is the answer to the problems that are here and the answer to the problems that are coming. So I love diversity. And if you\u2019re one of those people that just can\u2019t do that, I get it.\"</p><p>Rob Schneider <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/rob-schneider-weighs-in-garth-brooks-bud-light-drama\" target=\"_blank\">did an interview with Fox Nation</a>, and thinks Garth should do himself a favor by no longer talking: </p><p>\"I think next time, he's going to stay out of it. Isn\u2019t he? I think Garth Brooks, next time, is going to shut his mouth, and he's going to pretend like 'I don't have anything to do with what beer is chosen in my restaurant',\" the comedian says. \"I mean, just from a business standpoint, just shut up, say I have nothing to do with it.\"<br /></p><p><strong><em>Hey Brodigan? I've been in a coma for a month. Why does everyone hate Bud Light other than it being reconstituted bum piss?</em></strong></p><p>For the five of you who need to be brought up to speed, here are <strong>Bud Light's Keys to Derp</strong>:</p><ol><li>As part of Bud Light's NCAA tournament coverage, and to appeal to people who don't like either for some reason, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/captiv8-bud-light-dylan-mulvaney\" target=\"_self\">someone at Bud Light decided to work with titface performer Dylan Mulvaney</a>.</li><li>Melissa Weinerchild, the (now former) VP of Marketing responsible, made it clear on a podcast how much she hated Bud Light's loyal fanbase, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-exec-bear-market\" target=\"_self\">lashing out at them as fratty and out of touch</a>.</li><li>Fans from across the spectrum (NOT just the extreme right, we're not that organized) decided this was one woke pander from a company that hates them too many, and now <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-dethroned-beer-america\" target=\"_self\">Bud Light is no longer the #1 beer in America</a>.</li></ol><p>I get that Garth is a busy man and it is possible he wasn't following the news. While a country entertainer, he is still in the entertainment industry. His PR rep probably told him the entire brewhaha was because the extreme MAGA right hates trans people. And that's the only reason Anheuser-Busch lost tens of b-b-b-BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. Even then, Garth should have had more sense than to call people a**holes. <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/garth-brooks-shows-celebrities-not-jerks-trump\" target=\"_blank\">He used to be smarter than this</a>.</p><p>Had he simply said his restaurant would sell every beer and left it at that, it would have been left at that. People aren't angry at bars for serving Bud Light. We go to bars all the time and order something else.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.
