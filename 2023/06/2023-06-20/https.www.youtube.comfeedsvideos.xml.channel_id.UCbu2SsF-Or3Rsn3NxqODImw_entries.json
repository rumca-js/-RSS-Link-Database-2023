Is there a cure? Kurt's been trying to find it for an entire year.\n\nNothing feels as cool as full-immersion VR but, for many people, motion sickness spoils the fun. Do a quick search online, and you'll find everyone has their own solution to overcome the dreaded VR motion sickness. What else is there to do other than try them all?\n\nTo prepare for the PSVR 2, Kurt has been road-testing cures for VR sickness, from root ginger to waving his arms around like a maniac, with the goal of playing for 30 minutes in full immersion VR using his Meta Quest 2, in games like Resident Evil 4 VR and The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners, without getting sick. \n\nIn this episode of The Kurt Locker, Kurt finds out if any of these cures really work, and wonders if the industry simply need to be better at adapting games to suit every player.\n\nCheck out more episodes of The Kurt Locker here: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpg6WLs8kxGNL5FL6lNys2rK-3lajF_F8\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 - Love VR, hate motion sickness\n01:08 - Back to January 2022\n02:05 - Method 1: Waving Arms\n03:42 - Method 2: Root Ginger\n04:48 - Method 3: Ginger Beer\n05:07 - Method 4: Fan\n05:30 - Method 5: Deal With It!\n06:20 - The Truth About Immersion\n\n#gamespot #thekurtlocker #vrgaming #gaming", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83xPDlT0Ejk", "date_published": "2023-06-20 15:00:05+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
