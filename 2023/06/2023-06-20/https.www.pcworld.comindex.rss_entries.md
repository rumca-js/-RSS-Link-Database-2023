But since it first offers a complete list of all your installed software, complete with detailed information about its installation, it&rsquo;s also a great information tool. </p>



<p>After starting Uninstall View, press <strong>Ctrl</strong> + <strong>A</strong> to select all entries in the list. Then click on the disk symbol to save the information. Boom! You&rsquo;re done. </p>

## EVE Online’s Excel integration is live: Pretend spaceships, real spreadsheets

<p><em>EVE Online</em>, known as the most robust player-driven persistent online world in gaming (by people who actually play it) and &ldquo;that space game with all the spreadsheets&rdquo; (by people who don&rsquo;t), is getting a new tool for players today. But it&rsquo;s not new worlds to explore or rebalanced ship stats, it&rsquo;s integration with the very real Microsoft Excel desktop and web program. The spaceships might be pretend, but the spreadsheets are now very real. </p>



<p>EVE developer CCP Games announced the partnership with Microsoft <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://pressreleases.triplepointpr.com/2023/01/06/ccp-games-reveals-2023-eve-online-content-roadmap-two-expansions-and-excel-integration-launch/&amp;xcust=2-1-1961022-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">back in January</a>, originally planning to launch Excel integration last month. But it&rsquo;s live <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.eveonline.com/news/view/information-is-power-excel-release&amp;xcust=2-1-1961022-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">in today&rsquo;s Viridian</a><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.eveonline.com/news/view/information-is-power-excel-release&amp;xcust=2-1-1961022-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> </a><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.eveonline.com/news/view/information-is-power-excel-release&amp;xcust=2-1-1961022-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">game update</a>, accessible via the official <em>EVE Online</em> add-in for Excel. Players can export data from the game directly to Excel &mdash; you don&rsquo;t even need an Office 365 subscription, assuming you only want the data output. </p>



<p>&ldquo;By unleashing the full potential of Excel&rsquo;s robust analysis and visualization tools, players can gain deep insights into their in-game activities, track their progress, and strategize their next steps,&rdquo; says the official press release, with no hint of irony. </p>



<p>We can poke fun all we want, but <em>EVE Online</em> is one of the most long-running online games in history, celebrating its 20th anniversary last month and boasting hundreds of thousands of active players. They&rsquo;re drawn to the game&rsquo;s deep skill system, complex economies, and wide-open roleplaying. These let players participate in simulated corporations, organized crime, and massive universe-shaking wars, all perfectly allowed within the game&rsquo;s systems. </p>



<p><em>EVE&rsquo;s </em>minute-to-minute gameplay doesn&rsquo;t appeal to everyone, but it generates some of the most interesting stories of player activity ever, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://kotaku.com/how-eve-players-pulled-off-the-biggest-betrayal-in-its-1806168400&amp;xcust=2-1-1961022-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">like a Hollywood-style heist</a> of an entire player corp&rsquo;s assets worth thousands of real-world dollars, or a team of hitmen who spent a year hunting down one of the game&rsquo;s most powerful players <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.pcgamer.com/murder-incorporated-ten-months-of-deception-for-one-kill-in-eve-online/&amp;xcust=2-1-1961022-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">for a contract assassination</a>. With players so obsessed with the minutia of their in-game characters and assets, it&rsquo;s no wonder that using real-world analytical tools like Excel would have its own appeal. </p>

## Outlook will replace Windows 11’s Mail and Calendar apps in 2024

<p>Microsoft already revealed that it&rsquo;s working on <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/702533/you-can-officially-try-out-microsofts-new-outlook-client-right-now.html">a new version of Outlook for Windows</a>. In fact, Office Insiders can already test the next-generation version by selecting &ldquo;Try the new Outlook&rdquo; in the top right corner of the program itself.</p>



<p>Now, Microsoft has <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/outlook-for-windows-the-future-of-mail-calendar-and-people-on-windows-11-715fc27c-e0f4-4652-9174-47faa751b199&amp;xcust=2-2-1961053-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">said a little more</a> about what will happen to Windows 11&rsquo;s existing Email and Calendar apps. Basically, they will cease to exist at the end 2024. In September next year, the new Outlook experience will be released to the public, and new PCs will start to ship with the new Outlook preinstalled.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Beginning in 2024, new Windows 11 devices will be shipped with the new Outlook for Windows as the default mailbox application free for all to use,&rdquo; the company writes. &ldquo;The Mail and Calendar applications will continue to be available via download in the Microsoft Store through the end of 2024. On existing devices, users can switch to the new Outlook for Windows from a toggle in the Mail and Calendar applications.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The idea from Microsoft&rsquo;s side is to create a more uniform user experience. You&rsquo;ll be able to add accounts from other email providers to the new Outlook, and having all that information alongside your calendar in the same app simplifies and streamlines things. </p>

<p>When it comes to gaming, a solid mouse can make a massive impact, regardless of the types of games you play. If you&rsquo;re on the hunt for one, you&rsquo;re in luck, as we&rsquo;ve got a crazy awesome deal on tap for you today. Amazon&rsquo;s currently selling the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Rival-Gaming-Mouse-Programmable/dp/B08176SM7C&amp;xcust=2-2-1960532-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">SteelSeries Rival 3 wired gaming mouse for just $9.98</a>, which is a whopping 67 percent off of the original $29.99. It&rsquo;s a fantastic starter mouse if you&rsquo;re new to the world of gaming mice.</p>



<p>The SteelSeries Rival 3 features six programmable buttons, a maximum CPI of 8,500, and RGB lighting. CPI stands for counts-per-inch and refers to the sensitivity of a mouse. The 8,500 isn&rsquo;t the fastest number we&rsquo;ve ever seen, but that&rsquo;s not necessarily a bad thing, as a hyper-responsive mouse can be difficult to control if you&rsquo;re not accustomed to it. The Rival 3 is also made of high-grade polymer, which means it should be plenty durable. According to Amazon buyers, it&rsquo;s a good option for MMO players because of the side buttons. </p>



<p>This is a phenomenal deal. I mean, you really can&rsquo;t beat the ridiculously low price of $9.98. Get it now.</p>

## Update your Asus Wi-Fi router right now
 - [https://www.pcworld.com/article/1960748/update-your-asus-wi-fi-router-right-now.html](https://www.pcworld.com/article/1960748/update-your-asus-wi-fi-router-right-now.html)

<p>If you&rsquo;ve dropped a pretty penny on a gaming-grade Wi-Fi router from Asus (or just one of its more expensive models), you need to update the firmware right away. That&rsquo;s according to a security bulletin from Asus itself, which says that older firmware contains critical vulnerabilities. Routers from the Republic of Gamers GT and GS series, the cheaper TUF and RT series, and the ZenWiFi mesh systems are affected. </p>



<p>According to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/asus-urges-customers-to-patch-critical-router-vulnerabilities/&amp;xcust=2-2-1960748-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bleeping Computer</a>, there are two vulnerabilities patched in the latest router firmware, both of which could be used to gain arbitrary code execution. In layman&rsquo;s terms, it&rsquo;s possible for attackers to run custom firmware or even small software apps on unpatched routers, leading to all sorts of nasty issues, the most immediate being the ability to remotely monitor your web traffic. </p>



<p>The Asus routers impacted by the issue <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.asus.com/content/asus-product-security-advisory/&amp;xcust=2-2-1960748-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">are as follows:</a> </p>



<ul><li>GT6</li><li>GT-AXE16000</li><li>GT-AXE11000 PRO</li><li>GT-AXE11000</li><li>GT-AX6000</li><li>GT-AX11000</li><li>GS-AX5400</li><li>GS-AX3000</li><li>ZenWiFi XT9</li><li>ZenWiFi XT8</li><li>ZenWiFi XT8_V2</li><li>RT-AX86U PRO</li><li>RT-AX86U</li><li>RT-AX86S</li><li>RT-AX82U</li><li>RT-AX58U</li><li>RT-AX3000</li><li>TUF-AX6000</li><li>TUF-AX5400</li></ul>



<p>Basically, if your router looks like it could be an alien mothership, you should update the firmware. For pretty much all of them, you can update the firmware via the web-based management interface (which you probably haven&rsquo;t touched since you set the thing up two years ago). Some models also allow you to update via a Windows and/or phone app. Check the support documentation for your specific model for instructions. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s nice to have choices, and the Pro-G40 external SSD provides a very useful one: Thunderbolt 3/4 or 10Gbps USB. Yup, you can connect this drive to either bus depending on need: optimal speed, or minimal power consumption. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Further reading:</strong> See our roundup of the best external drives to learn about competing products.</p></blockquote>



<h2 id="sandisk-pro-g40-design-features-and-price">SanDisk Pro-G40 design, features, and price</h2>



<p>Though the highlight of the Pro-G40 is its dual-bus (10Gbps USB/40Gbps Thunderbolt 3) compatibility, it&rsquo;s also extremely rugged and weather-toughened. The Pro-G40&rsquo;s IP68 rating (no dust intrusion, and no water intrusion up to 1 meter) is nothing to scoff at. Given the exposed (no plug or cover) Type-C connector, it&rsquo;s no mean trick either. </p>



<p>The other thing about the Pro-G40 is that, it&rsquo;s, err&hellip; expensive. The 1TB model retails for $160, the 2TB for $200, and the 4TB for $400. By way of comparison, the 2TB <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/626738/samsung-t7-shield-ssd-review-fast-ruggedized-10gbps-usb-storage.html">Samsung T7 Shield</a> is a mere $140. </p>

<p>The high price means you should only consider the Pro-G40 if you want Thunderbolt. Thunderbolt storage is always expensive, so don&rsquo;t take this as a knock on the Pro-G40&mdash;there are more expensive Thunderbolt drives.</p>



<p>As for the technology inside, to achieve the throughput Thunderbolt can deliver NVMe is required. Indeed, AS SSD enumerated the internal drive as a Western Digital (the parent company) SN750E&mdash;an NVMe drive. What bridge or combo chip is in use internally, SanDisk didn&rsquo;t say.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1944466" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sandisk-G-Drive-Pro-G40-type-c.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The Pro-G40 with its single Type-C port highlighted. </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>A note on Thunderbolt 3 versus Thunderbolt 4&mdash;both are the same speed (40Gbps) and basic technology, with slightly different specs in terms of what they should support before they can use the logo. Version 4 was basically implemented to force vendors to implement the entirety of the spec, which includes tunneling USB/DisplayPort/HDMI, etc., to be certified. Many early implementations were less than complete.</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re buying a Windows PC and want to make sure you have all of Thunderbolt&rsquo;s features, look for the Thunderbolt 4 logo. Macs have always featured a complete implementation. For drives, including the SanDisk Pro-G40 or OWC&rsquo;s Envoy series, Thunderbolt 3 is all you need as they function only as storage. </p>



<h2 id="how-does-the-sandisk-pro-g40-perform">How does the SanDisk Pro-G40 perform?</h2>



<p>Though the Pro-G40 is a decent performer over the 10Gbps USB bus, it&rsquo;s obviously going to be an even better one using 40Gbps Thunderbolt. The gold bars below offer plenty proof of that. </p>



<p>However, before the obvious speed advantage seduces you, I should tell you that I&rsquo;ve backed off pure Thunderbolt drives for everyday use, opting instead for USB 10Gbps and 20Gbps. Why&rsquo;s that, you ask? It&rsquo;s generally fast enough, uses less power, and produces less heat. </p>



<p>It&rsquo;s not really Thunderbolt&rsquo;s fault&mdash;it&rsquo;s merely that the faster transfers use more juice, which in turn makes things hotter. Of course, when I have a really big transfer operation, I switch to Thunderbolt&mdash;I&rsquo;m not crazy!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>The Pro-G40 is a very good performer&mdash;it gives you top speed when you need it and daintier power consumption and less heat when USB will do.</p><p></p></blockquote></figure>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1940353" height="524" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pro-G40-T3-CDM8-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /><figcaption>Thunderbolt makes a huge difference under CrystalDiskMark 8 and the Pro-G40 was a bit above average for USB 10Gbps. Longer bars are better.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As you can see above, the Pro-G40 really goes to town on Thunderbolt, and is quite good as a 10Gbps USB drive as well. Note that the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/399150/wd-black-p50-game-drive-ssd-review.html">WD Black P50</a> is a Superspeed 20Gbps drive, not 10Gbps like the Pro-G40 and Samsung T7 Shield. It&rsquo;s merely there to show the differences between 10Gbps, 20Gbps, and 40Gbps.</p>



<p>In order to keep the charts readable, I left out the other combo USB/T3 drive I&rsquo;ve tested for Macworld&mdash;the <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/331884/owc-envoy-pro-fx-ssd-review.html">OWC Envoy Pro FX</a>. The Envoy Pro FX is a worthy product, but performs a hair slower than the Pro-G40 over Thunderbolt, and for some reason, was a slow reader over 10Gbps USB. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1940354" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pro-G40-T3-48GB-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Using Thunderbolt the Pro-G40 reigned supreme, but was only average for USB 10Gbps. Shorter bars are better.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The 48GB transfers shown above were very close between the Pro-G40 and the T7 Shield, with the Pro-G40 taking a slight victory by virtue of a very fast folder read time.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Sandisk Pro-G40 450GB" class="wp-image-1948469" height="599" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pro-G40-T3-450GB-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The <p>SanDisk Pro-G40 was fast over Thunderbolt, but rather slow via USB when writing our single large 450GB  file. Shorter bars are better.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jon L. Jacobi</p></div>



<p>While the Pro-G40 over Thunderbolt was fast at the 450GB write, the drive was considerably slower than the T7 Shield via 10Gbps USB. Not by a ton, but noticeably so.</p>



<p><em>Note that while the Pro-G40 ships formatted to APFS, we reformatted to NTFS for testing. ExFAT would allow you to switch between macOS and Windows/Linux machines with impunity. </em></p>



<p>Overall, the Pro-G40 is a very good performer, and as noted, gives you top speed when you need it and daintier power consumption and less heat when USB will do.</p>



<p></p>



<h2 id="should-you-buy-the-sandisk-pro-g40">Should you buy the SanDisk Pro-G40?</h2>



<p>Thunderbolt drives are never cheap, but they&rsquo;re absolutely worth it if performance is paramount. In fact, it&rsquo;s hard to tell them apart from internal storage when in use. USB, on the other hand is fast enough for most folks and uses significantly less power.</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s a rather roundabout way of saying: If you need the speed, go for it&mdash;the Pro-G40 is as good as we&rsquo;ve seen for a dual-bus drive. But given the price, if 10Gbps will suffice, go for a less expensive drive such as the Samsung T7.  </p>



<p><strong>How we test</strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>External drive tests currently utilize Windows 11 64-bit running on an X790 (PCIe 4.0/5.0) motherboard/i5-12400 CPU combo with two Kingston Fury 32GB DDR5 4800MHz modules (64GB of memory total).

<p>Of all the PC components, few require more care and attention than a hard drive. We&rsquo;ve all heard the admonishments to defragment drives, and clean up junk files to keep all our 1s and 0s sparkling. No matter how well you care for it, however, at some point that drive is going to fail. Sometimes you can hear it coming, sometimes it happens suddenly in the middle of a project, and other times it just refuses to boot one morning.</p>



<p>Whatever way your hard drive meets its end, it&rsquo;s a certainty you&rsquo;ll see it happen if you use a PC long enough. </p>



<p>Hard drives are complicated little devices. The primary components are the magnetic platters that contain the data, as well as the head that reads and writes the data. Those moving parts are the great benefit and big flaw of your hard drive. One ill-timed drop of a laptop, or a sudden move of a desktop tower, and the drive can be irreparably damaged. Wait long enough, however, and the drive will just fail on its own&mdash;a pair of recent studies discovered that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1810214/back-it-up-most-dead-hard-drives-fail-within-3-years.html"><em>if</em> a hard drive dies, it does so within three years</a>. Moving parts always die in time.</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s why hard drives need closer monitoring than a solid state drive, which has no moving parts. They die too, but usually not under the same conditions. If you&rsquo;re thinking about using an SSD as your primary boot drive, check out <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3234838/best-ssds.html">our roundup of the best SSDs</a>.</p>



<p>While you can&rsquo;t always predict when or how your hard drive will bite the dust, you can take a few steps to see it coming.</p>

<h2 id="get-smart">Get SMART</h2>



<p>The first tool for keeping tabs on a hard drive is its Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology, or SMART, feature. This system is built into most modern hard drives and SSDs, and it&rsquo;s designed to report when your drive is failing or encountering issues. Drive manufacturers can take their own approaches to SMART, but they generally measure similar performance points such as read error rates, mechanical shock, hard disk temperature, seek time performance, and so on.</p>



<p>Most of the time the SMART system works in the background, but you can bring it to the fore in a number of ways.</p>



<p>The simplest way is to use the Windows command line utility WMIC, which stands for Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (utility). This basic tool is a simple yay/nay health result based on the SMART statistics. Open a Windows command prompt and enter the following: <code><strong>wmic diskdrive get model,status</strong></code>.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="WMIC windows" class="wp-image-1956877" height="573" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/WMIC-windows.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /><figcaption>An example of WMIC in action.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Ian Paul/IDG</p></div>



<p>The results should look something like the image here. It&rsquo;s preferable to ask for the model as well as status so that you can determine more quickly which drive is failing if a problem is reported. This is not so much an issue for laptops, but it&rsquo;s helpful for desktops with multiple drives.</p>



<h2 id="crystaldisk-info">CrystalDisk Info</h2>



<p>If you&rsquo;d like something with a little more detail then another option is to use <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://crystalmark.info/en/software/crystaldiskinfo/&amp;xcust=2-1-393207-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">CrystalDisk Info</a>. CDI is a free desktop program that can display a lot of information about your disks, but the top area is probably enough for most people. (CDI is also wonderful for <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/541476/how-to-check-your-ssd-health-stats-crystaldiskinfo.html">seeing your SSD&rsquo;s hidden stats</a>.)</p>



<p>Here, CDI displays a status for each drive using a color-coding system: Good (blue), Caution (yellow), Bad (red), and Unknown (gray). Most of the time you should just see a Good status, but if you see one of the others it&rsquo;s time to keep an eye on that drive.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/07/crystaldiskinfo2020-07-100851678-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="crystaldiskinfo2020 07" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/07/crystaldiskinfo2020-07-100851678-medium.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption>
<p>CrystalDiskInfo 8.6.2 showing the status of a WD hard drive.&nbsp;</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing about checking the SMART status: It&rsquo;s not 100-percent reliable. Consider <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/disk_failures.pdf&amp;xcust=2-1-393207-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">a Google study published in 2007</a>: The authors found that 36 percent of the drives monitored for the study reported no SMART issues at all before failing.</p>



<p>Things haven&rsquo;t changed much either. In 2016, Backblaze reported that it was seeing <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.backblaze.com/blog/what-smart-stats-indicate-hard-drive-failures/&amp;xcust=2-1-393207-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">23.3 percent of its data center drives failing</a> without reporting issues from the five SMART attributes it tracks.</p>



<p>Statistically speaking the majority of discs <em>do</em> report SMART issues before failing; however, statistics become less reliable when trying to predict the fate of a single drive. In other words, your particular drive might report issues before failing, or it might not.</p>



<p>SMART is also a part of SSDs, but it has the same drawbacks and limitations as hard drives. The best solution right now for SSDs is to use monitoring tools provided by the drive maker such as Crucial&rsquo;s Storage Executive, WD&rsquo;s SSD Dashboard, or Samsung&rsquo;s Magician Software.</p>



<h2 id="beyond-smart">Beyond SMART</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="hard drive data pixabay" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/08/hard-drive-data-pixabay-100768802-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /><figcaption>
<p>HDD interiors almost resemble a high-tech record player.</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p>While SMART is a useful tool for monitoring your drive&rsquo;s health, you should also keep an eye on how your drive behaves and sounds. If you start to<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2039654/the-sounds-of-a-sick-pc-listen-to-the-noises-that-could-mean-bad-news.html"> hear a grinding noise emanating from your PC</a>, for example, that is mostly likely the hard drive. Either its end is near, or it&rsquo;s going to start malfunctioning soon.</p>



<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t hear a funny noise, your drive can cause odd things such as frequent crashes, a high number or error messages, folder or file names that have odd characters in them, very sluggish performance, or documents suddenly filled with garbage. Most of these issues are a pretty clear sign your drives are about to end, but not always.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, check to see if your storage device drivers are up to date.&nbsp;This is a good basic step for any component, and it may improve your storage drive&rsquo;s performance if you&rsquo;re encountering issues.</p>



<p>If a driver update doesn&rsquo;t help, run Windows&rsquo; built-in &lsquo;chkdsk&rsquo; (check disk) command-line utility. For those looking to take extra care, run it every few months, at the start of each quarter, for example.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="ckdsk windows 10" class="wp-image-1956883" height="888" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chkdsk-windows.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /><figcaption><p>Run the command prompt as an administrator to use &lsquo;chkdsk.&rsquo;</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Ian Paul/IDG</p></div>



<p>&rsquo;Chkdsk&rsquo; runs only with elevated privileges. To do this, search for <strong>command prompt</strong> in the Windows 10 or 11 search box, and then select <em>Run as administrator</em> from the options as pictured here.</p>



<p>To just check the status of all your drives type&nbsp;<strong><code>chkdsk</code></strong> for a read-only status of your drives. If you want it to fix problems you need to run the check disk program with the <code>/F</code> or <code>/R</code> options. The <code>/F</code> option focuses on fixing filesystem errors, while the <code>/R</code> option also checks for bad physical sectors on the drive&mdash;don&rsquo;t use the&nbsp;<code>/R</code> option on an SSD as this option is not built for solid state drives. The&nbsp;<code>/R</code> option can take a very long time to complete, and needs to work on a reboot so only run that when you have the time. The <code>/F</code> option also needs a reboot to run but requires less time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An example command might be <code><strong>chkdsk d: /r</strong></code>. That command tells the utility to check only your D drive. In this scenario the C: drive is an NvME SSD and D: is the higher-capacity hard drive that requires servicing.</p>



<p>Windows is set to run chkdsk automatically, so you may be alerted to issues before you do a manual run of this utility.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To avoid the worst effects of dying storage drives, make sure you&rsquo;re doing regular backups. The best option is to use something that saves multiple historical states of your data such as Windows&rsquo; built-in File History. That way if a recent backup has the same garbage drives, you can go back in time to retrieve earlier versions of them. If you don&rsquo;t like File History check out our tour of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3201971/best-windows-backup-software.html">the best Windows backup software</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3198109/best-external-drives.html">our round-up of the best external drives</a> to store your backups.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s also a good idea to use <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407149/online-cloud-backup-services-carbonite-idrive-backblaze-livedrive.html">a cloud backup service</a> so you have a third copy of your data that&rsquo;s offsite. An alternative would be to have two hard drives doing File History backups, and keeping one offsite, with regular swaps to keep each drive as current as possible.</p>



<p>Once you start seeing serious hard drive errors that can&rsquo;t be fixed with check disk, it&rsquo;s time to replace the drive as soon as possible, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407542/best-ssds.html">ideally with an SSD</a> if possible. If the errors can be fixed, you can probably eke a little more life out of the drive, but it&rsquo;s still a good idea to replace it and avoid further heartache.</p>

## Why Microsoft’s best Windows app store is actually Github

<p>No disrespect to the Microsoft Store, but it&rsquo;s not the most exciting place to discover new Windows software.</p>



<p>Peruse Microsoft&rsquo;s official app store and you&rsquo;ll mostly find the obvious, with apps like Word, Adobe Photoshop, and Zoom gracing the front pages. While the store does have some hidden gems, most of what&rsquo;s on display feels a bit too squeaky clean.</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for surprise and delight, the real action is happening over on <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://github.com/&amp;xcust=2-2-1953809-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Github</a>. The site for software developers to manage their projects, which Microsoft <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/402057/microsoft-buys-github-for-7-5-billion.html">spent $7.5 billion to acquire in 2018</a>, is brimming with weird and wonderful indie apps that you can download for free.</p>



<p>Of course, Github isn&rsquo;t really an app store, and it&rsquo;s not set up to help people discover it&rsquo;s hidden treasures. But given the inventiveness on offer, maybe it should be.</p>



<h2 id="great-apps-on-github">Great apps on Github</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSEdgeRedirect" class="wp-image-1953816" height="948" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/msedgeredirect.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>MSEdgeRedirect: Search from the Start menu using your default search engine and browser.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>The quintessential Github app is a bit geekier from your typical app store fare. Often it&rsquo;s the product of a lone developer who wanted to fix a software annoyance for themselves and decided to share the results with the world. Some developers accept donations or charge for app store versions of their work, but everything you find on Github itself is free to download.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1786965/bring-back-windows-11s-missing-features-for-free-with-explorer-patcher.html">Explorer Patcher</a>, which we covered recently, is a great example. It&rsquo;s designed to restore taskbar labels and other features that Microsoft removed in Windows 11, all without having to perform any manual registry edits. Along a similar line, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://github.com/rcmaehl/MSEdgeRedirect&amp;xcust=2-2-1953809-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">MS Edge Redirect</a> routes web searches from the Windows Start menu to your default browser, using your search engine of choice. That way, you&rsquo;re not forced to use Microsoft Edge and Bing when searching via the taskbar.</p>

<p>Some examples are even more subversive. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/&amp;xcust=2-2-1953809-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">YouTube-DL</a>, for instance, lets you download YouTube videos through the Windows Command Prompt, and other developers have built spin-offs with full graphical interfaces, such as <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://github.com/yt-dlg/yt-dlg&amp;xcust=2-2-1953809-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">YT-DLG</a> and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://github.com/axcore/tartube&amp;xcust=2-2-1953809-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Tartube</a>. (A few years ago, Github pulled YouTube-DL in response to a takedown request from the music industry, but <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/github-reinstates-youtube-dl-after-riaas-abuse-dmca&amp;xcust=2-2-1953809-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">quickly reversed course</a> under pressure from developers and activist groups.)</p>



<p>In some cases, great apps get their start on Github long before arriving in any app store. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/auto-dark-mode/XP8JK4HZBVF435&amp;xcust=2-2-1953809-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Auto Dark Mode</a>, a sorely-needed Windows app for switching between dark and light system themes, first launched in Github in November 2018, nearly three years before making its way to the Microsoft Store. Lively Wallpaper, a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1479976/lively-wallpaper-free-windows-wallpaper-app.html">great app for dynamic desktop backgrounds</a>, popped up on Github in 2019, but didn&rsquo;t launch a Microsoft Store version until last year. If you&rsquo;re not averse to beta software, Github lets you try cool apps in their earliest stages.</p>

<p>Microsoft doesn&rsquo;t do much to showcase what&rsquo;s available to end users on Github, and that&rsquo;s a shame, given what a useful resource it can be.</p>



<p>So in lieu of any official recommendations, here are some additional apps hosted on Github that are worth checking out:</p>

<h2 id="before-you-start-downloading">Before you start downloading</h2>



<p>Compared to software from an App Store, installing apps from Github carries a bit of risk. Many hobbyist developers don&rsquo;t pay for code-signing certificates, so Microsoft&rsquo;s SmartScreen protections flag their software as potentially dangerous.</p>



<p>In lieu of any official review process, the best you can do to vet a particular program is look for online reviews or check the project&rsquo;s &ldquo;Issues&rdquo; page to see if it&rsquo;s being actively developed and commented-on. In SmartScreen, you&rsquo;ll then have to click &ldquo;More Info,&rdquo; then &ldquo;Run Anyway&rdquo; to bypass Microsoft&rsquo;s safety checks.</p>



<p>Assuming an app isn&rsquo;t outright malicious, it can still cause problems, especially if it&rsquo;s making fundamental changes to your machine. With Explorer Patcher, for instance, Microsoft previously <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/resolved-issues-windows-11-22h2&amp;xcust=2-2-1953809-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">warned against installing the software</a> after a Windows update led to boot-up issues. Those issues have since been resolved, but they do illustrate how things can go wrong.</p>



<p>But for the adventurous, hopping outside the confines of an app store is well worth the reward, and Github is one of the best places to start doing that.</p>
