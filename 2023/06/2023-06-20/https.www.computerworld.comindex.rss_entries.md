<p>I’ve tracked Microsoft’s Windows patches for years and closely watched all of the changes the company has made. I remember when you had to install updates in a certain order — and watch for which one had to be installed first. I remember the arrival of automated patching using Software Update Services (later called Windows Server Update Services). I’ve seen how we went from a system where each vulnerability was patched individually to what we now have: cumulative patching.</p><p>The ideal patch is self-contained. Install, reboot, get back to your work. It causes no side effects. It protects the operating system. And you forget about it because it does what it’s supposed to do.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3700189/with-one-june-patch-tuesday-update-microsoft-falls-short.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>For months now, the economic prophets have been saying a recession is coming. I'm not an economist, but I have been running a small home-based business for decades. I've been through good times and bad. My particular industry — journalism — is in trouble. But then, it's always been in trouble.</p><p>I keep looking ahead, and I don't see a recession coming.</p><p>What do I know that others don't? Not much, but when I look at the same inflation, unemployment, market numbers, and other economic data. I come away with an entirely different view. I don't understand why the "experts" don't see it either.</p><p>For instance, we all know that major tech companies are <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3685936/tech-layoffs-in-2023-a-timeline.html">laying off tens of thousands of people</a>.
