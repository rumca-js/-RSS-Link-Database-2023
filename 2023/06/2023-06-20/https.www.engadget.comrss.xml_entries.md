<p>It looks like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/copyright-in-spotlight-after-streaming-platforms-pull-ai-generated-drake-song-183513972.html">Fake Drake</a> won’t be taking home a Grammy. Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr. <a href="https://www.grammy.com/news/recording-academy-ceo-harvey-mason-jr-discusses-2024-grammys-new-rules-guidelines">said</a> this week that although the organization will consider music with limited AI-generated voices or instrumentation for award recognition, it will only honor songs written and performed “mostly by a human.”</p><p>“At this point, we are going to allow AI music and content to be submitted, but the Grammys will only be allowed to go to human creators who have contributed creatively in the appropriate categories,” Mason said in an interview with <em>Grammy.com</em>. “If there’s an AI voice singing the song or AI instrumentation, we’ll consider it. But in a songwriting-based category, it has to have been written mostly by a human. Same goes for performance categories – only a human performer can be considered for a Grammy. If AI did the songwriting or created the music, that’s a different consideration. But the Grammy will go to human creators at this point.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The CEO’s comments mean the fake Drake / The Weeknd song “Heart on My Sleeve,” which went viral earlier this year before getting wiped from streaming platforms over copyright takedowns, wouldn’t be eligible. Another AI-generated scammer <a href="https://www.engadget.com/scammers-used-ai-generated-frank-ocean-songs-to-steal-thousands-of-dollars-222042845.html">sold fake Frank Ocean tracks</a> in April for a reported CAD 13,000 ($9,722 in US dollars), while Spotify has been busy <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-has-reportedly-removed-tens-of-thousands-of-ai-generated-songs-154144262.html">purging tens of thousands</a> of AI-made songs from its library.</p><p>On the other hand, it raises questions about artists like Holly Herndon, who used an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/holly-plus-holly-herndon-dolly-parton-jolene-ai-cover-204750236.html">AI version of her voice</a> for a cover of Dolly Parton’s “Jolene.” (The AI-generated performance would suggest not, but would the fact that it’s her own voice make a difference?) Or, for that matter, there’s the upcoming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/paul-mccartney-is-using-ai-to-create-a-final-song-for-the-beatles-133839244.html">“final” Beatles track</a> that Paul McCartney says will use AI to isolate a garbled recording of John Lennon’s voice. And would Taryn Southern, who (also transparently) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/31/17777008/artificial-intelligence-taryn-southern-amper-music">used AI to co-produce</a> her 2018 debut album, be eligible? We reached out to the Recording Academy for clarification about these examples and will update this article if they respond.</p><p>Awards or not, Mason acknowledged that AI would upend the music industry. “AI is going to absolutely, unequivocally have a hand in shaping the future of our industry,” Mason said. “So, we have to start planning around that and thinking about what that means for us. How can we adapt to accommodate? How can we set guardrails and standards? There are a lot of things that need to be addressed around AI as it relates to our industry.” The CEO added that the Recording Academy recently held a summit “with industry leaders, tech entrepreneurs, streaming platforms, and people from the artist community” to discuss AI’s future. “We talked about the subject and discussed how the Recording Academy can be helpful: how we can play a role and the future of AI in music.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai-generated-music-wont-win-a-grammy-anytime-soon-211855194.html?src=rss

## US Senate is the latest to look into Amazon's warehouse safety practices

<p>A US Senate committee is <a href="https://www.help.senate.gov/chair/newsroom/press/news-chairman-sanders-opens-sweeping-investigation-into-amazon-warehouse-safety-and-calls-for-amazon-workers-to-share-their-stories">investigating</a> Amazon’s warehouse safety practices. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, sent a <a href="https://www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/letter_from_help_chairman_sanders_to_andy_jassy_amazon_ceo.pdf">letter to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy</a> today, initiating the probe. Sanders urged Jassy to address health and safety issues at the company’s warehouses and requested additional information about its response to various safety issues. In a statement to Engadget, Amazon said, “We’ve reviewed the letter and strongly disagree with Senator Sanders’ assertions,” while adding that it has extended an invitation for the Senator to tour one of its facilities.</p><p>Sanders’ nearly 2,400-word letter takes the retailer to task for reported injuries and unsafe practices at its warehouses. “The company’s quest for profits at all costs has led to unsafe physical environments, intense pressure to work at unsustainable rates, and inadequate medical attention for tens of thousands of Amazon workers every year,” Sanders wrote. “At every turn — from warehouse design and workstation setup, to pace of work requirements, to medical care for injuries and subsequent pressure to return to work — Amazon makes decisions that actively harm workers in the name of its bottom line.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The letter contrasts Amazon’s history of warehouse injuries and safety complaints with its $1.3 trillion market value, founder Jeff Bezos’ net worth of nearly $150 billion and Jassy’s $289 million in compensation over the last two years. It cites <a href="https://thesoc.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/SOC_In-Denial_Amazon-Injury-Report-April-2023.pdf">figures</a> from the Strategic Organizing Center (SOC), a coalition of North American labor unions, that paint the company’s patterns as “uniquely dangerous.” “In 2022 alone, Amazon warehouse workers suffered nearly 39,000 injuries, 95 percent of which were so serious that they required workers to either lose time at work or switch to modified duty,” Sanders wrote. “Amazon’s rate of serious injuries at its warehouses, at 6.6 injuries per 100 workers, was more than double the rate at non-Amazon warehouses. And despite constituting only a little more than a third of the warehouse workers in the country, Amazon workers suffered more serious injuries than all of the other warehouse workers in the United States combined.”</p><p>In an email to Engadget, Amazon disputed SOC’s data. “There will always be ways for our critics to splice data to suit their narrative, but the fact is, we’ve made progress and our numbers clearly show it. Since 2019, we’ve reduced our rate of recordable injuries across our global network by more than 23%, and we’ve reduced our Lost Time Incident Rate by 53%. This is easily verifiable by examining the data we report to OSHA.” In addition, the company <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/amazon-workplace-safety-report-2022">highlighted a report</a> detailing its “meaningful and measurable progress,” while pointing us to a <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/how-amazon-keeps-employees-and-drivers-safe">blog post</a> regarding its efforts to help combat the effects of summer heat.</p><figure><img alt="Sen.

It also asks the company to address why Amazon’s claims of robotics improving safety don’t align with data that says its robotic facilities have 28 percent higher injury rates than non-robotic ones. Finally, it asks for communications about a connection between workers’ pace of work and the prevalence of injuries.</p><p>In addition to his letter, the Senator <a href="https://www.help.senate.gov/amazon-investigation">created a website</a> for current and former Amazon workers to submit stories about their experiences with the company. Sanders asked Jassy to respond by July 5th.</p><p>This is far from the first complaint about Amazon’s safety practices. A <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-tornado-edwardsville-illinois-deaths-climate-220437155.html">company warehouse collapsed</a> in December 2021, spurring <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ocasio-cortez-warren-amazon-safety-letters-152056210.html">Congressional action</a> that described Amazon’s response as “disappointing” and part of a “wholly inadequate safety culture.” In response to the collapse, Amazon tweaked its severe-weather strategy but <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-no-storm-shelters-warehouses-illinois-tornado-193224505.html">refused to build storm shelters</a> at its warehouses. In addition, federal prosecutors and the US Department of Labor <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-government-investigating-amazon-warehouses-over-poor-working-conditions-105547252.html">announced an investigation</a> last year over the company’s workplace conditions — a move that included OSHA inspections. In April, the SOC said <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-was-responsible-for-more-than-half-of-all-serious-us-warehouse-injuries-last-year-report-finds-191753314.html">Amazon was responsible</a> for 53 percent of all severe warehouse injuries in the US despite employing around one-third of the country’s warehouse workers.</p><p>“When faced with worker injuries, Amazon provides minimal medical care while hiding those injuries from regulators and workers’ compensation programs,” said Sanders. “This system forces workers to endure immeasurable long-term pain and disabilities while Amazon makes incredible profits from their labor. That cannot be allowed to continue.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/us-senate-is-the-latest-to-look-into-amazons-warehouse-safety-practices-200029313.html?src=rss

## Roblox now allows creators to build content for people 17 and older

<p>Roblox has traditionally been <a href="https://backlinko.com/roblox-users"><ins>most popular among kids and pre-teens</ins></a>, despite it claiming to be a “platform for all ages.” Now, in a departure from its family-friendly reputation, the company says it will allow creators to make content specifically for users 17 and older. This isn’t an insignificant portion of Roblox’s user base either – the platform said in its <a href="https://blog.roblox.com/2023/06/introducing-experiences-for-people-17-and-older/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=introducing-experiences-for-people-17-and-older"><ins>press release</ins></a> Tuesday that in 2022, 38 percent of its daily active users were over 17.</p><p>In particular, Roblox says that creators will be able to “feature more mature themes and storylines in TV shows and stand-up comedy.” <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/8862768451604"><ins>According to the company</ins></a>, this may include violence, blood, crude humor, romantic themes and alcohol. Players may see “unplayable” gambling content as well, though it is not immediately clear what that would entail. We have asked Robox to clarify.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To access this content you’ll need to verify your age by uploading a photo of your driver’s license or ID along with a selfie to verify that you are who you say you are. Roblox says that this system will provide “greater confidence in people’s age and identity,” and that more age verification methods may be added in the future.</p><p>Eligible creators can start making these experiences starting today. These experiences will start rolling out to “eligible” users in the coming weeks. Roblox says that its goal is to provide a safe and engaging experience for people ages 17 or older. The company isn’t being specific on what qualifies as an “eligible” creator or user. We’ve reached out to Roblox for comment and will update this story if we’ve heard back.</p><p>Roblox has traditionally marketed itself to younger audiences. For example, earlier this year, the company partnered with Razer to release <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razers-roblox-edition-accessories-will-let-your-kids-friends-know-they-come-from-money-180006348.html"><ins>kid-specific Roblox Edition gaming gear</ins></a>. But with a little over a third of that user base being over the age of 17, it makes sense that the company wants to provide more content geared toward adults.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/roblox-now-allows-creators-to-build-content-for-people-17-and-older-195024163.html?src=rss

## Apple's expanded self-repair program covers the iPhone 14 and newer MacBooks

<p>Apple is <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0MTMwZTJmMC1hMTRmLTRjNWUtYmRhYi1jZDUyYWM3ZDhlNzkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL25ld3Nyb29tLzIwMjMvMDYvYXBwbGUtZXhwYW5kcy1zZWxmLXNlcnZpY2UtcmVwYWlyLWFuZC11cGRhdGVzLXN5c3RlbS1jb25maWd1cmF0aW9uLXByb2Nlc3MvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4YmM4NTRlNy00NWUwLTQzOTgtODZmNC1kNmNiMDg4YTk3MTYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUzrwvlsBzeOb73pm-LTFZNDrekPT6Qhu1Z5N1Li3sx-&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2023%2F06%2Fapple-expands-self-service-repair-and-updates-system-configuration-process%2F">widening</a> its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-self-service-repair-iphone-mac-142122774.html">Self Service Repair program</a> to cover its more recent devices, and it's reducing some of the hassles in the process. As of June 21st, you can get the parts, tools and manuals needed to fix the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-14-review-camera-test-sample-pictures-notch-specs-battery-life-130022134.html">iPhone 14</a> range as well as the M2-based versions of the 13-inch <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-air-m2-review-2022-130040098.html">MacBook Air</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-pro-13-inch-review-m2-2022-130005000.html">MacBook Pro</a>. You can also fix the TrueDepth camera and top speaker on iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 models in the US, UK and seven European countries. M1-based desktops like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-imac-m1-review-24-inch-portable-desktop-130026556.html">the iMac</a> are also included, Apple says.</p><p>Crucially, you won't have to call Apple to finish your repairs. The System Configuration tool, which verifies and authenticates fixes with official parts, now works simply by putting a device into Diagnostics mode and following instructions. While staff will still be on hand if needed, they're now strictly optional. The tool is vital  for a fully functional device as it not only calibrates parts, but ties biometrics (such as Face ID and Touch ID) to the Secure Enclave.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The program effectively gives users many of the repair resources previously limited to Apple technicians. You can buy necessary components and either buy or rent necessary tools. While it's potentially expensive, it may be more viable than conventional support if you're comfortable with fixing electronics and don't want to send your hardware to someone else. This may be particularly helpful if you don't live close to an Apple-certified repair shop.</p><p>As before, Self Service Repair <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-user-iphone-repair-policy-change-173047862.html">isn't an entirely altruistic gesture</a>. The company is facing increasing pressure from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-right-to-repair-ftc-apple-microsoft-214015408.html">national</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/new-york-right-to-repair-law-kathy-hochul-184654713.html">state</a> governments that are passing Right to Repair laws and regulations. The European Union wants to <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2023-0237_EN.html">mandate</a> replaceable batteries, for instance.

## Spotify Desktop app gets a new look and upgraded library features

<p>Spotify has really let its desktop app go in recent years, throwing most of its resources at the mobile apps and certain vaccine-hating podcasters. However, the desktop side of things just <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-06-20/spotify-desktop-experience-redesign-your-library-now-playing-views-customize/"><ins>received a major overhaul</ins></a> in what the company is calling “one of the biggest revamps yet” to bring the standalone app and web app up to speed with more popular smartphone-based cousins. After all, Spotify was originally a browser-based experience even before it made its way to fancy phones.</p><p>The main content area remains unchanged, with the same access to browsing and recommended songs and podcasts, but the left-side of the app window now features the recently-launched “Your Library” feature, which the company started testing a few months back. This gives you immediate access to saved music and podcast collections, helping to save time when switching between playlists. You can now collapse the library for a compact view, which is always nice.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There’s also a new “Now Playing” view on the right side of the screen that displays the current content you are listening to, complete with biographical information on the artist. Additionally, this field gives you access to purchase merchandise directly from the artist and take a peak at any upcoming tour dates. Some podcasts will also automatically populate a transcript via this field as you listen.</p><p>The “Friend Activity” feed moved to make room for the new stuff, but you can move it back. Just look for the “friends” icon next to your profile picture at the top-right corner of the main content area and drag and drop to bring the feed back to its former glory. You can also completely remove both the &quot;Friends Activity&quot; and &quot;Now Playing&quot; windows for a streamlined look.&nbsp;</p><p>All of these changes come with an eye-catching splash of paint to make everything look and feel like the smartphone versions of the app. The update rolls out today to all desktop users worldwide. This is a big day for the streaming service, as it just announced that comedian Trevor Noah <a href="https://www.engadget.com/trevor-noah-is-launching-a-weekly-talk-show-podcast-on-spotify-113516329.html">signed a deal for a weekly talk show</a> and rumors continue to swirl <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-may-finally-be-ready-to-launch-a-premium-hifi-audio-tier-123847826.html">regarding a forthcoming hi-fi audio tier. </a></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/spotify-desktop-app-gets-a-new-look-and-upgraded-library-features-184540624.html?src=rss

<p>Did you ever get to the end of <em>Wizard of Oz</em> and have notes – the nagging intuition that you could have taken down all those pesky flying monkeys or handled the backstabbing intricacies of Munchkin guild politics more effectively than Dorothy and her band of misfits did in the books? Thanks to the new AI storytelling platform Hidden Door, which plops players into TTRPG-like adventures based in their favorite literary universes, you’ll soon have the chance to walk the Yellow Brick Road however you see fit.</p><h2>What’s behind (hidden) door number one</h2><p>Hidden Door is both the company and the game. Hidden Door, the company, was co-founded by Hilary Mason, who is also CEO, and Matt Brandwein in 2020 with a mission to “inspire creativity through play with narrative AI.” The staff is split nearly evenly between machine learning engineers and traditional game designers, Mason told Engadget.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Hidden Door, the game, is the company’s currently-in-development social roleplaying narrative AI project. “[We are] trying to take all the joys of a tabletop game and allow you to play it without all the friction [of having to do it physically], and AI is the technology enabling that,” Mason said.</p><p>Leveraging the capabilities of large language models and procedural generation systems, Hidden Door creates immersive RPG campaigns using the player’s preferred IP — it could be <em>Wizard of Oz</em>, as was released on Monday, or <em>Star Trek</em>, <em>Old Man’s War</em>, <em>Dungeon Crawler Carl</em> or Agatha Christie’s assembled murder mystery library. (Just so long as the IP owner agrees to license their proprietary universe for use, which the latter four have not, the former of which has been dead long enough for it to no longer matter.)</p><p>“We solve a fundamentally different, technical problem than what you would see if you were just plugging content into an LLM like ChatGPT,” Mason said. “There, what you do is take an unstructured text prompt and put it into a model which is largely a black box.”</p><p>“GPT-3 came out a few months into our project and it was clearly incredibly biased – uncontrollable and … not useful in doing something like keeping a story on the rails,” she explained. “The core of our design came from that initial desire to build a safe, controllable system for telling amazing stories.</p><p>“We realized that if we were able to accomplish our safety goals,” she continued, “we would also be able to create something controllable enough that authors would be comfortable allowing people to play in their worlds.”</p><h2>The building blocks of a cursed village</h2><p>Take <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>, for example – a public domain series originally written in 1904 by L. Frank Baum that spans 14 books in total. Hidden Door has adapted that corpus of text into an immersive in-game universe that the user, and up to three teammates, can explore. The system does so by taking unstructured inputs from the players and mapping them to the Hidden Door game state, “which is essentially a game engine that represents in a database the characters, locations, items, relationships, and their conditions,” Mason explained.</p><p>Each player starts out making a character sheet to establish their avatar’s stats and backstories. From there, the system will incorporate that data, as well as the users’ responses to in-game prompts to generate a story. Rather than create each scenario for each story from scratch every time, the story engine works on what are essentially pre-computed tropes, Mason explained, “We call them 'story thread templates' and they're at the level of things like … a cursed village. Your objective for the scene is to figure out where the curse is coming from and resolve it.”</p><figure><img alt="a screenshot of the game. Your Party in upper left, current player lower left, Narrator lower right, a stack of in-game modifier card things I don't know how this works upper right, text-based narration/play-by-play of the story in the center of the screen. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/d8734970-0c5d-11ee-8bef-f65e6b29ec40" style="height: 2160px; width: 3840px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Hidden Door</div></figure><p>The templates serve as the basic building blocks of the story, establishing the narrative, providing structure for the players to explore and interact with the scene, and ultimately helping define when the story ends. The village curse, “you don't know what it is,” Mason said. “You don't know who has cursed the village or why, so it sets those things up and then it lets you loose so you explore, you interact, you set things up.”</p><p>Every template is either handwritten or generated and hand-edited by a person. The team has already created thousands of such templates. By stringing three or four such templates together, the game can create a compelling narrative arc that allows players to deeply explore these universes but while maintaining strong content and safety guardrails.</p><h2>Safety (and inclusivity) first</h2><p>We’ve already seen way too many examples of what goes wrong when you let a chatbot off its leash. Whether it’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-03-24-microsoft-tay-ai-grounded.html">spouting Nazi propaganda</a> or making <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-bard-chatbot-false-information-twitter-ad-165533095.html">incorrect claims about space telescopes</a>, today’s large language models are highly susceptible to veering unbidden into hate speech, “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/anthropics-claude-ai-is-guided-by-10-secret-foundational-pillars-of-fairness-193058471.html">hallucinating</a>” facts, and on occasion, <a href="https://people.com/human-interest/man-dies-by-suicide-after-ai-chatbot-became-his-confidante-widow-says/">bullying people into suicide</a>. These are all issues you don’t want popping up in an all-ages game, so there are many things you cannot say while playing.</p><p>“You cannot submit anything you want,” Mason said. The system will generate suggested actions based on what the player writes, but will not accept the written input directly. The system will even give feedback and comment on what the player is suggesting, “it might say, ‘Oh, no one's ever tried that before’ or ‘that's gonna be really hard for you,’” she continued, but any action suggested by the system can be pre-approved.</p><p>“There is no word ever in one of those constructed sentences that's not in our dictionary,” Mason said. “That gives us control, both for safety and for preventing inappropriate content – like, if you were to type in, ‘I joined the Nazis,’ it would reply with, ‘you get a bowl of nachos.’ We're not gonna let you do that – and also, for keeping the story inside the bounds of believability for the in-game world.”</p><figure><img alt="a stylized mage asking you to " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/26f88e20-0f83-11ee-af5a-eb8e04cb0ecc" style="height: 2049px; width: 3096px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Hidden Door</div></figure><p>The company’s adherence to inclusivity is also easily recognizable in the character creation process. “We made a very deliberate decision to pull things out where we thought a model might inject bias [like a character’s pronouns],” Mason said, “such that they are essentially on a pre-computed distribution.”</p><p>That is, there is no machine learning associated with it, they’re hard coded into the gameplay. “Things like roles are in no way coupled to your avatar, your skills or anything like that. You decide your pronouns and they're respected throughout the system,” she said. “There's no machine learning model  that is deciding that a doctor should be a he and a nurse should be a she. It'll be randomly assigned.”</p><h2>Go ahead, snoop around</h2><p>Aside from committing war atrocities, telling aristocrats jokes and other forms of mass violence, players can do most anything they want once the game starts. In <em>Oz</em>, each instance starts at the same point in the story, right when Dorothy splatters the Wicked Witch of the East under her house. The players aren’t part of Dorothy’s direct story but exist in the same time and space. “It's the moment most of us think about when we think about that world, which is why we chose it,” Mason said.</p><p>But from there, the player’s decisions and actions make the Land of Oz their own. ”We think of the world almost as its own character that is collectively growing as people play the story,” Mason said. “You're discovering new locations that get generated as you're playing these stories and the world grows.”</p><p>And nothing says that you have to follow the conventional “off to see the Wizard” storyline. If a player gets to the Munchkin village, looks around and decides to declare themselves mayor, the game will absolutely adapt the story to those new conditions. Instead of completing quests of battling flying monkeys and tipping pails of water, players will be tasked with running political campaigns and winning support from key members of the community. But again, you wouldn’t be able to walk into town, declare yourself Warlord and begin summary dissident purges — because those words aren’t in Hidden Door’s dictionary.</p><p>“We have thread templates that would be, ‘you're persuading a bunch of people to support you in a political race,’” Mason said, “And once you are a mayor, you would be able to tell stories that just start in a different place.”</p><p>Those decisions are also persistent within the game instance. Deciding to help (or not) an NPC will impact their opinion of the player and influence their future interactions, for example. What’s more, those generated NPCs will reappear in subsequent playthroughs as recurring characters within your specific game instance.</p><div id="6cd1ddc0ecfa4c759711669e0dabf91a"></div><p>“You can play as many stories in the same world as you want,” Mason said, “and everybody's version of the <em>Wizard of Oz</em> will be really different depending on how they play over time.” NPCs and other generated assets aren’t sharable between groups yet, but that is something the team might look at implementing in the future.</p><p>In order to prevent playthroughs from getting bogged down in side quests, the Hidden Door team has developed a design philosophy that Mason refers to as “Chekhov’s Armory.” It’s basically where the system keeps track of all of the player’s in-game decisions and their influences on other assets within the story. Whenever the system needs to move the plot forward, or inject some additional drama to keep the players engaged, it can dip back into the Armory to pull out an earlier plot thread or previously wronged enemy. This also helps the system maintain continuity of the overall storyline and prevent catch-22s from forming.</p><p>“The idea was to create this feeling of the story, where your choices matter, where you have that full agency, but also there are rails moving you forward,” Mason said. “That's been one of our most frequent design challenges, to adjust how much freedom versus how much we should motivate the story forward.”</p><h2>16 secret herbs and language models</h2><p>Hidden Door’s LLM differs significantly from the likes of ChatGPT in that it is not a monolithic model but rather 16 individual ML algorithms, each specialized to address a specific sub-task within the larger generative task.</p><p>We use a variety of models, some of them were building on open source models, some of them are proprietary,” Mason explained. “It's not just one big LLM, it's decomposing it into an interpretable system where we can use the best [AI] at the right moment.” It also enables the team to quickly plug in and benchmark newly released AI models against the existing system to see if it can improve game quality. “Frankly, we design these engines so that game designers and narrative designers can be the ones to come in and tune it, which means we have to give them those knobs”</p><p>“One big question we worked on for a while was a plot-prediction algorithm,” Mason continued. “So, ‘what should happen next based on the series of actions that is just happened?’” Interestingly the team quickly found that they could generate incredibly dull stories simply by consistently choosing the system’s top recommendation — because that choice is invariably, “the most obvious thing,” that could happen. Conversely, if the system works in too many twists and surprise reveals, the story quickly turns into chaos.</p><p>This granularity is what enables the designers to tweak the underlying game architecture to work for (example) a light-hearted <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> RPG as well as a grimdark <em>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</em> version. “We think a lot about how our creative colleagues are going to be able to use this system to create the story experiences,” Mason said.</p><h2>Gore and smooching are A-OK (but only if it’s canon)</h2><p>While the game is designed to be family friendly, Hidden Door’s target demographic is the 18-35 age range and, as such, more mature themes are very much on the table top for designers, so long as they make sense within the existing story. For <em>Wizard of Oz</em>, violence is both ok and a major plot point.</p><p>“We work directly with authors and creators and can use as little, or as much, written material as they have,” Mason said. “We extract the characters, the types of plots, the vocabulary, the elements, the writing style, the locations.”</p><figure><img alt="A high fantasy version of the game " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/ccdd6d60-0f83-11ee-bfff-2127168ccb99" style="height: 2160px; width: 3840px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Hidden Door</div></figure><p>The team also uses what it calls a “sub-genre based model” that helps to generate the “formula” of the story. “<em>The Wizard of Oz</em> is largely fantasy that has a few additional rules to it, like animals can talk, but there are no dragons or other sort of fantastical creatures.” Essentially, the system takes a more general “fantasy tale” template and molds it into the specific form of the story, “down to the specific rules of the <em>Wizard of Oz</em> universe,” Mason said. Authors that license their works for use in the game will be able to dictate not just the initial starting plot points of the story, but the specific behaviors of NPCs and inclusion of story arcs.</p><p>There is no “Adult” story module currently available but in-game physical affection is allowed. “You can make them kiss,” Mason said. “We have a very tasteful fade to black and then you're on to the next scene. The NPC may also reject you if they don't like you or you don't have the kind of relationship. That is something that's very tunable but we try to keep it at the level of relationship in the core material.”</p><h2>The future of interactive fandom</h2><p>“It raises the floor for creation dramatically,” Mason said of generative AI’s broader promise to the game industry, “but it doesn't raise the ceiling.” We’re just beginning to see gen AIs used for improving NPC dialog, Mason points out, and could be as little as a year or two away from seeing a game “fully realized” using generative AI. “The brilliance of a human with a creative vision is not something we see generally out of these systems and that is in part because of what they are: a compression of a large amount of data and an aspiration to the median.”</p><p>“I do think there's a lot of excitement in being able to raise the floor. I think it makes creativity more accessible to a large number of people who may then decide to pursue it in their own way or use it as a tool in their process,” she continued. “I also think it makes it possible for more people to be fans of things and to have some autonomy in the way they want to interact with creativity that we don't currently have.”</p><p>If you want to try Hidden Door for yourself, you can sign up <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://hiddendoorco.typeform.com/to/n8xAxgvP__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!HpMlv_NxnaaKM0I6aew7_7ZTKUW6U-Pn4LwXQ46cIlUhPIC2RNAjHeXxorVA_gric0XN19nLEY87V96ZCaXwOpo$">for the waitlist</a> ahead of future test runs.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/how-do-you-prevent-an-ai-generated-game-from-losing-the-plot-170002788.html?src=rss

## News publishing giant Gannett sues Google for monopolizing ad tech

<p>Gannett, a news publisher accused of monopolistic behavior, is <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=14bcaa59-fd9f-4864-a7d9-a27d287727bc&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=USA+TODAY&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIxNGJjYWE1OS1mZDlmLTQ4NjQtYTdkOS1hMjdkMjg3NzI3YmMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudXNhdG9kYXkuY29tL3N0b3J5L29waW5pb24vMjAyMy8wNi8yMC9nYW5uZXR0LWNlby13aHktd2UtYXJlLXN1aW5nLWdvb2dsZS1mb3ItaXRzLWJ1c2luZXNzLXByYWN0aWNlcy83MDMzNjkxMDAwNy8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjUxNDM0MzRiLTgzYjktNDRlYi04NGMwLWQ2MTBhYzE0ZDUwYyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAdtcn9ETtrOlO13Ldgp14y72wPEoIX1Tf0TBbD46JGtX&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Fopinion%2F2023%2F06%2F20%2Fgannett-ceo-why-we-are-suing-google-for-its-business-practices%2F70336910007%2F">suing Google</a> for monopolistic behavior. It’s the latest in a string of lawsuits against the search giant, and it repeats many of the arguments made by the Department of Justice in its second lawsuit against Google, filed earlier this year. Gannett is the US’ largest news publisher. “Google has monopolized market trading to their advantage and at the expense of publishers, readers and everyone else,” Gannett CEO Mike Reed <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/20/gannett-sues-google-over-its-alleged-ad-tech-monopoly.html">said to</a><em>CNBC</em>. “Digital advertising is the lifeblood of the online economy. Without free and fair competition for digital ad space, publishers cannot invest in their newsrooms.”</p><p>Gannett, which owns <em>USA Today</em> and various local papers, says Google has overly broad control over the online ad business, leading to diminished ad spending despite growing online readership. The crux of the complaint is that Google owns the largest ad exchange and ad server — both acquired rather than built organically — and that arrangement has led to diminished industry revenue.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“Content providers, including hundreds of our local news outlets, create enormous value but see none of the financial upside because Google, as middleman, has monopolized the markets for important software and technology products that publishers and advertisers use to buy and sell ad space,” Gannett CEO Mike Reed wrote today. “Google trades on that conflict of interest to its advantage and at the expense of publishers, readers and everyone else. Our lawsuit details more than a dozen significantly anticompetitive and deceptive acts by Google, starting as early as 2009 and persisting to present day.”</p><p>In a statement to Engadget, Google insisted that its services are popular because they’re the best — not due to a lack of competition. “These claims are simply wrong. Publishers have many options to choose from when it comes to using advertising technology to monetize — in fact, Gannett uses dozens of competing ad services, including Google Ad Manager,” VP of Google Ads Dan Taylor said. “And when publishers choose to use Google tools, they keep the vast majority of revenue. We’ll show the court how our advertising products benefit publishers and help them fund their content online.” Google says the average large publisher will use six different platforms to sell ads on its websites, while advertisers and media agencies will use over three platforms to buy ads. The search giant describes its ad tech fees as transparent and consistent with industry rates.</p><figure><img alt="FILE - In this July 14, 2010 file photo, the sign for Gannett headquarters is displayed in McLean, Va.

It was the DOJ’s second lawsuit against Google, following one filed in 2020 under former Attorney General Bill Barr, accusing the company of having a monopoly over search and search-related advertising.</p><p>Gannett’s and the DOJ’s most recent lawsuits claim Google has stifled competition in the space through acquisitions. “Whenever Google’s customers and competitors responded with innovation that threatened Google’s stranglehold over any one of these ad tech tools, Google’s anticompetitive response has been swift and effective,” the DOJ said.</p><p>Gannett is no stranger to monopolistic accusations. Although the company is over 116 years old, it was acquired by New Media Investment Group and merged with GateHouse Media (taking on the Gannett brand) in 2019. Since the merger, Gannett has laid off over half its workforce and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/04/10/1169014791/news-us-newspaper-latest-gannet-media">shut down numerous local news outlets</a>. In the period immediately following the acquisition, Gannett “owned 261 daily and 302 weekly newspapers,” <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2023/03/the-scale-of-local-news-destruction-in-gannetts-markets-is-astonishing/">according to</a><em>Nieman Lab</em>. “By the end of 2022, those totals were 217 daily and 175 weekly newspapers,” although some were due to selling papers to local buyers. In addition, the company went from about 25,000 employees at the time of the acquisition to 11,200 in its most recent filing report.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/news-publishing-giant-gannett-sues-google-for-monopolizing-ad-tech-164602826.html?src=rss

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/cruise-charge-fully-driverless-rides-san-francisco-092000547.html">Cruise</a> has finally launched an Android app for ridehailing, giving potential customers in San Francisco the option to call one of its robotaxis even if they're not iPhone users. The self-driving car company told <em>Engadget</em> that 20 percent of its waitlisters are on Android, and an app for the platform is one of people's most-requested updates on social media.

<p>You no longer have to hop between apps just to perform some common tasks in Chrome on your iPhone. Google is updating Chrome <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2FwcHMuYXBwbGUuY29tL2FwcC9nb29nbGUtY2hyb21lL2lkNTM1ODg2ODIzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzNjZkM2VmMy1mMTQzLTRlNWMtYmNjYS00MmZjOGUwZTg2N2IifQ&amp;signature=AQAAATZh3OC63-y9FREB6bYBrI9sN1D74sQGE0ubl5JvZgaI&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fgoogle-chrome%2Fid535886823">for iOS</a> with the option to see Maps addresses, create Calendar events and translate specific text without switching to the relevant app. You can find the location of a restaurant, remind yourself to visit that restaurant and decipher the menu all from one place.</p><p>A future upgrade will also make <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-10-google-lens-in-ios-search-app.html">Google Lens</a> considerably more useful. You'll have the option of searching with your camera, whether to take new pictures or draw from your camera roll. As on Android, this might be helpful if you spot a flower or must-have jacket and want to identify it on the spot. The functionality will be available in the "coming months."</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You'll still need to use Google's dedicated apps for more advanced functions, such as driving directions in Maps or managing the rest of your itinerary. However, the additions should make Chrome more of a do-it-all app that saves time (and battery life) versus running multiple apps at once. That, in turn, may make Chrome more alluring than Safari as your iPhone's default browser.</p><p>The expansion comes soon after Google introduced Chrome Actions, or text-based shortcuts for popular browser tasks like clearing your browsing data and checking settings. Google has even been experimenting with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-chrome-blink-ios-experiment-220001141.html">using its own web engine</a> in Chrome for iOS if and when Apple loosens its app policies. Simply put, the company is making Chrome more of a power user's tool.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/chrome-on-ios-can-now-show-maps-and-create-calendar-items-without-switching-apps-160028132.html?src=rss

## Lawmakers seek 'blue-ribbon commission' to study impacts of AI tools

<p>The wheels of government have finally begun to turn on the issue of generative AI regulation. US Representatives Ted Lieu (D-CA) and Ken Buck (R-CO) introduced legislation on Monday that would establish a 20-person commission to study ways to “mitigate the risks and possible harms” of AI while “protecting” America's position as a global technology power.&nbsp;</p><p>The bill would require the Executive branch to appoint experts from throughout government, academia and industry to conduct the study over the course of two years, producing three reports during that period. The president would appoint eight members of the committee, while Congress, in an effort &quot;to ensure bipartisanship,&quot; would split the remaining 12 positions evenly between the two parties (thereby ensuring the entire process devolves into a partisan circus).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;[Generative AI] can be disruptive to society, from the arts to medicine to architecture to so many different fields, and it could also potentially harm us and that's why I think we need to take a somewhat different approach,” Lieu told the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/06/20/lawmakers-propose-blue-ribbon-ai-commission/"><em>Washington Post</em></a>. He views the commission as a way to give lawmakers — the same folks <a href="https://www.engadget.com/heres-what-tiktoks-ceo-told-congress-about-the-apps-ties-to-china-and-teen-safety-201657076.html">routinely befuddled by TikTok</a> — a bit of &quot;breathing room&quot; in understanding how the cutting-edge technology functions.</p><p>Senator Brian Schatz (D-HI) plans to introduce the bill's upper house counterpart, Lieu's team told <em>WaPo</em>, though no timeline for that happening was provided. Lieu also noted that Congress as a whole would do well to avoid trying to pass major legislation on the subject until the commission has had its time. “I just think we need some experts to inform us and just have a little bit of time pass before we put something massive into law,” Lieu said.</p><p>Of course, that would then push the passage any sort of meaningful Congressional regulation on generative AI out to 2027, at the very earliest, rather than right now, when we actually need it. Given how rapidly both the technology and the use cases for it have evolved in just the last six months, this study will have its work cut out just keeping pace with the changes, much less convincing the octogenarians running our nation of the potential dangers AI poses to our democracy.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/lawmakers-seek-blue-ribbon-commission-to-study-impacts-of-ai-tools-152550502.html?src=rss

## Domino's can now deliver pizza almost anywhere using GPS pins

<p>You no longer need to be at a fixed address if you're craving pizza. Domino's is <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dominos-is-making-pizza-delivery-even-more-convenient-introducing-dominos-pinpoint-delivery-301853111.html">introducing</a> a Pinpoint Delivery feature in the US that, as the name implies, will send pies to a GPS pin you drop on the map. You can get pizza at the beach, or feed the soccer team without leaving the field. The company tells Engadget that deliveries are available anywhere a restaurant serves, so long as the driver can safely pull over. You won't get a pie while you're at the top of a mountain during a hike, then, but you could have Domino's bring the pie to the trailhead when you've returned to your car.</p><p>You'll have to pre-pay for your order online and agree to text updates on your driver's status. You can track the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-09-dominos-gps-delivery-tracking-us-expansion.html">delivery person's GPS location</a> as you would with regular deliveries. Sorry, you can’t pay cash once the driver arrives. Once they do, you can turn on a &quot;visual signal&quot; on your phone (like you do with some ride-hailing services) to flag them and complete the pickup.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company claims it's the first &quot;quick-service&quot; restaurant chain in the US to offer GPS pin-based deliveries. That's a narrow category, and some delivery apps like Instacart at least offer the option to modify your location once you pick an address. Still, it's clear the company is betting that a rideshare-style approach to delivery could help it win business. You're theoretically more likely to pick Domino's if you know you can get it virtually anywhere, not just at your home or office.</p><p>Domino's frequently uses technology as a marketing hook. You can already order pizza <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-21-chevy-dominos-pizza-ordering-from-cars.html">from your car</a>, or fetch your food from a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dominos-autonomous-pizza-delivery-houston-143052956.html">self-driving delivery vehicle</a>. In that sense, Pinpoint Delivery is just a logical extension of the company's strategy — it's a way to reel in tech enthusiasts who may order from whichever restaurant is the most convenient or novel.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/dominos-can-now-deliver-pizza-almost-anywhere-using-gps-pins-143013196.html?src=rss

<p>Earlier this year, Panasonic launched the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-launches-its-first-hybrid-autofocus-cameras-the-s-5-ii-and-s-5-i-ix-150053908.html">S5 II and S5 IIX</a> full-frame cameras, finally embracing phase-detect autofocus that puts it on par with rivals. I’ve already <a href="https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-s5-ii-review-the-full-frame-vlogging-camera-youve-been-waiting-for-150028638.html">tested the S5 II</a> and found it to be one of the company’s best cameras yet for content creators. Now, we’re looking at what I think is the more interesting model, the S5 IIX.</p><p>It has an identical design and shares many of the same features as its sibling, like the new autofocus system and highly effective in-body stabilization. However, it adds a key function: the ability to record high-quality, easy-to-edit ProRes video internally onto SSDs via the USB-C port. With a bit of rigging, you can record hours of 4K or even 6K video to a relatively inexpensive drive.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p></p><p>What’s surprising is that the <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9QYW5hc29uaWMtTWlycm9ybGVzcy1UZWNobm9sb2d5LVByby1SZXMtU3RyZWFtaW5nL2RwL0IwQlI4Rlk1SFQ_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMTNsLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhNTA4MDdiZC00Njc4LTRmODMtODFiZi00YjIwOGM5OWQ3OTMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAATH7oskMSiB21bB586miQrNZIR7dRv88IY_YZmFq1QX7&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPanasonic-Mirrorless-Technology-Pro-Res-Streaming%2Fdp%2FB0BR8FY5HT">S5 IIX</a> only costs $200 more than S5 II. ProRes RAW is also included for free, whereas it’s a $200 upgrade on the S5 II. To see if it’s worth that, I shot photos and videos in Paris, Brittany and elsewhere around France.</p><h3><strong>Body and Handling</strong></h3><p>I’ve already looked at the S5 II’s body and controls, and the S5 IIX has an identical layout – but it’s worth revisiting them briefly —  particularly in the context of video and content creation.</p><p>One key difference is the general appearance. The S5 IIX has a distinctive dark design, with a black logo and subtle gray graphics on the controls. The only dash of color to be found is the red record button. Quite a number of bystanders have oohed and aahed over the black-on-black look.</p><div id="018a8e0a5a9b4827898efee91742af0f"></div><p>Like the S5 II, the X model is a nice handling camera. The grip is large and uses relatively tactile materials, and features a ridge at the ring finger so it won’t slip out of your hands. The controls are spot on, with the record button in an easy-to-find location on top. That said, it would’ve been nice to have another one on the front like the GH6. The menus are also among the best among camera companies (and nearly the same as the GH6), with most settings easy to find.</p><p>It weighs 714 grams, a bit more than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-a7-iv-mirrorless-camera-review-163026066.html">Sony’s A7 IV</a> and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canon-eos-r-6-ii-review-an-excellent-hybrid-camera-with-few-flaws-140005140.html">Canon EOS R6 II</a>. An external SSD can also add 100 grams or more, making it a bit heavy if you’re holding it out at the end of your arm while vlogging.</p><p>The screen fully articulates for self-shooting and has a sharp 1.84-million-dot display. It features a 3.69-million dot electronic viewfinder with resolution that’s comparable to rivals and easily enough to check focus when shooting on a bright day. It has a full-sized HDMI port that’s key for a camera with RAW video output, and USB-C for capturing internal video.</p><p>The S5 IIX also includes dual UHS-II SD card slots, headphone and mic ports, plus the same battery as the original S5, GH6 and other models. You can get about 370 shots on a charge by CIPA stands, fewer than most of its rivals. For video, you can shoot for about 45 minutes at 4K 60p, again, a touch less than rivals.</p><p>If you’re planning to rig the S5 IIX to use SSDs, many folks are using the <a href="https://www.smallrigreseller.com/smallrig-universal-holder-for-external-ssd-bsh2343.html">SmallRig universal holder with a hotshoe mount</a>, though any clamping type device will work (I’m using a smartphone tripod mount from Joby). If you need to use a shotgun microphone along with the SSD, you may need to mount it elsewhere on the camera, though, or use a cage. As for SSDs, Panasonic lists models from Samsung and SanDisk compatible with the GH6 (which has the same USB-C feature) and those should work for the S5 IIX as well. Other high-speed models should work as well.</p><h3><strong>Video</strong></h3><p>Yes, the S5 IIX is a hybrid camera, but video is the main attraction. With high-quality ProRes capture to an SSD, plus RAW video over the HDMI port, it offers a lot of capability for the price.</p><p>First, let’s look at capture via the USB-C port. It supports internal 10-bit ProRes capture to supported SSDs, which is a huge benefit to videographers. Media is relatively cheap, and there’s no need to transcode or even transfer footage – you can just hook up an external drive to a PC or Mac and start editing.</p><p></p><figure><img alt="Panasonic S5IIX review: Power and value in one vlogging package" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/5c703470-0b84-11ee-bfef-86da14f458e3" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Image by Steve Dent for Engadget</div></figure><p>In ProRes USB-C mode, there’s a strange mix of recording formats. It captures 5.8K 17:9 30p footage in either ProRes HQ (1.6Gbps) or regular ProRes (1.1Gbps), but not at 16:9. It can only capture 17:9 C4K at 60p with a crop, or 30p supersampled video without a crop. But again, not 16:9 Ultra HD. The 17:9 part isn’t a huge deal as you can crop the edges, but it’s odd considering most vloggers shoot 16:9 UltraHD. Perhaps that’s something Panasonic can address in a future update.</p><p>Luckily, you<em> can</em> capture 16:9 5.9K 25p footage and 4K 60p and 30p at 16:9 in the .MOV format. The latter supports All-I with data rates up to 800Kbps when capturing to USB-C, which is nearly as good as ProRes quality-wise though a bit slower for editing.</p><p>On top of that, you can record 12-bit ProRes RAW or Blackmagic RAW files to Atomos or Blackmagic recorders via HDMI. It supports recording up to 5.9K 30p at 16:9 and not 17:9, or the rather odd 4.1K 4,128 x 2,176 17:9 format. Again, not a huge issue as you can crop the sides, but also a bit weird.</p><figure><img alt="Panasonic S5IIX review: Power and value in one vlogging package" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/5c8d5960-0b84-11ee-b5fb-4986269670d7" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Image by Steve Dent for Engadget</div></figure><p>As with other Panasonic models, you can capture “open gate” 6K 3:2 footage that uses every pixel on the sensor. That allows content creators to easily output both horizontal and vertical formats, but also to capture anamorphic video with supported lenses.</p><p>Finally, you can record to regular old SD UHS-II cards. Where the S5 II is limited to recording longGOP files that aren’t very easy to edit, the S5 IIX can do most formats using an All-I codec at up to 600Mbps.</p><p>So how is the quality of all the video? Mostly excellent, depending on the format. 4K 30p video is supersampled, so it’s extremely sharp. Panasonic’s colors are accurate, quite natural and easier to work with than Sony’s files, I find. Skin tones aren’t as flattering as Canon offers, though.</p><p>4K 60p video is cropped to an APS-C size which isn’t ideal, considering Canon’s like-priced R6 II has uncropped 4K 60p. Sharpness also drops a hair, as it’s pixel-for-pixel instead of supersampled. 5.9K video is also captured on a pixel for pixel basis, but I like that format as it allows for a lot of cropping options.</p><p>Compared to other mirrorless cameras with the same resolution, it has good low-light capability. The Dual ISO system does a good job keeping noise down at ISOs as high as 12,800 or even 25,600.</p><figure><img alt="Panasonic S5IIX review: Power and value in one vlogging package" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/5c703470-0b84-11ee-aebf-aa20c9475845" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Image by Steve Dent for Engadget</div></figure><p>Panasonic’s V-Log delivers extra dynamic range, particularly with ProRes. Of course the best option, quality-wise, is V-Log RAW video. That lets you edit video just as you would with RAW photos, with a lot of room to recover highlights and shadow details. With those things together, the S5 IIX delivers results in line with expensive, professional video cameras.</p><p>Pros will also appreciate the new hybrid phase-detect autofocus. It’s designed to eliminate the wobble inherent in Panasonic’s past contrast-detect AF camera, and it does that very effectively.</p><p>The S5 IIX offers continuous AF modes along with subject tracking, for both humans and animals. It’s not quite up to Sony and Canon models like the A7 IV and R6 II, as subject tracking isn’t quite as fast or reliable. However, it’s as good or better than Nikon and Fujifilm’s latest models.</p><figure><img alt="Panasonic S5IIX review: Power and value in one vlogging package" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/5c8d3250-0b84-11ee-aa77-da9e1d7c89ba" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Image by Steve Dent for Engadget</div></figure><p>The S5 II has updated in-body stabilization borrowed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-gh-6-review-video-a-vlogging-workhorse-153048534.html">from the GH6</a>, and it’s powerful and impressive – the best on any camera on the market for video. It can’t match a gimbal, of course, but the electronic mode smooths out steps much better than the S5, despite some side-to-side sway.</p><p>It also has a “Boost IS” for handheld video with no movement, keeping shots locked off like the camera’s on a tripod. One cool feature not seen on too many other cameras is full stabilization support for anamorphic lenses (most types) via a setting.</p><p>And finally, it supports high audio quality either through the mic port or an XLR adapter that attaches to the hotshoe.</p><h3><strong>Photography</strong></h3><p>If you need to use the S5 IIX for photography from time to time, it’s not bad at all. You can shoot at up to 7 fps with the mechanical shutter or 30 fps in electronic mode. The buffer is quite impressive, as it allows for 200 shots in RAW before throttling. Oddly though, a USB-C drive doesn’t improve that number much compared to an SD card.</p><p>The autofocus can keep up as well, but as with video, it’s not quite as fast or smart as the AF on recent Sony cameras. It’s particularly noticeable when using the AI subject modes —  for example, it can lose a subject’s eyes if they turn their heads. Tracking is also a bit more limited than Sony and Canon models. Still, for vlogging and most types of content creation, it performs well.</p><p>The stabilization system is rock solid for photos. And photo quality is outstanding, with dynamic range comparable to Sony and Nikon’s latest models. You also get natural looking colors and skin tones. It also shines in low light situations thanks to the stabilization, dual ISO system and relatively large pixels.</p><h3><strong>Wrap-up</strong></h3><figure><img alt="Panasonic S5IIX review: Power and value in one vlogging package" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/6b089880-0b87-11ee-9f79-f59a531b1307" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Image by Steve Dent for Engadget</div></figure><p>When I reviewed the S5 II earlier this year, I said that its biggest competition would be the X version, and now I’m sure of that. Simply put, this is a $2,200 near-professional camera with the image quality and most of the features a content creator needs.</p><p>The new autofocus is good but not quite up to the Sony A7 IV, and it lacks full-frame 4K 60p video like the Canon R6 II. It’s far better for video than both of those models, though, thanks to the ProRes and other features nowhere to be found in either rival model. And the AF is as good or better than you’ll find on like-priced Nikon and Fujifilm models, with the focus wobble of past models a thing of the past.</p><p>One thing that might give you pause is the L-Mount lens choice and value. However, Panasonic recently lowered the prices on key lenses, including this 24-70m f/2.8 model. It now has 14 of its own lenses, on top of 31 from Sigma. All told, if I was looking for a new camera system for around $2,000, I wouldn’t hesitate to grab the S5 IIX.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-s5-iix-review-power-and-value-in-one-vlogging-package-133058128.html?src=rss

## The best budget gaming laptops for 2023

<p>Not everyone needs an NVIDIA RTX 4080, or a blazing fast 500Hz screen. These days, you can find plenty of affordable gaming notebooks that can easily hit decent frame rates in modern games. Cheaper machines are ideal for high school or college students who don't need the absolute best performance. And they're also great options for younger gamers, who may not be ready for the responsibility of a premium, $2,000 notebook.</p><h2>What is a budget gaming laptop?</h2><p>At the high end, you can easily spend $5,000 on a fully tricked-out notebook like the Razer Blade 18. When it comes to budget models, we're focusing on the other end of the pricing spectrum: laptops under $1,000. It used to be tough to find a decent gaming option at that price point but, as PC prices have fallen, they no longer seem like unicorns.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Stepping up a bit to systems between $1,000 and $2,000 puts you firmly in mid-range territory, which is beyond the scope of this guide. Still, it's worth keeping an eye out for sales that can push those PCs below $1,000. Be sure to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-laptops-172033838.html">check out our gaming laptop guide</a> for a general overview of what to look out for in these more expensive systems.</p><h2>Are budget gaming laptops worth it?</h2><p>Budget gaming laptops are definitely worth it if you’re trying to save money and are being realistic about what you can get at this price range. You can expect to find Intel and AMD's latest (but not greatest) CPUs, as well as entry-level GPUs like NVIDIA's RTX 3050. They're also typically paired with 1080p screens running at 120Hz or beyond. There are some exceptions though: <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=b1bb23c9-a2d4-4e4e-bfac-7a560ebe7641&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Dell&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJiMWJiMjNjOS1hMmQ0LTRlNGUtYmZhYy03YTU2MGViZTc2NDEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGVsbC5jb20vZW4tdXMvc2hvcC9nYW1pbmctbGFwdG9wcy9nMTYtZ2FtaW5nLWxhcHRvcC9zcGQvZy1zZXJpZXMtMTYtNzYyMC1sYXB0b3AvZ243NjIwZnJxYmgiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImFiYWI5YWI2LTFlNzEtNGZlZC04MmFkLTllMTIzZWE4ZjgwYyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAcsc71UVv2VNR-BjFG1-F3LlF3voNC_vTzQvidceW8cF&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fgaming-laptops%2Fg16-gaming-laptop%2Fspd%2Fg-series-16-7620-laptop%2Fgn7620frqbh">Dell's G16</a> (currently discounted to $900) is notable for its 16-inch quad HD+ screen.</p><p>Many cheap gaming laptops also skimp on RAM and storage. We'd recommend getting at least 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. Modern games need a decent chunk of memory to run, and they also tend to be large, so you wouldn't be able to fit much alongside Windows 11 on a 256B SSD. You might be tempted to jump on one of those dirt-cheap gaming laptop deals from Walmart or Best Buy, but it's just not worth it if you're stuck with 8GB of RAM or a tiny SSD.</p><p>As for build quality, expect to find more plastic than metal on budget systems. Still, everything we're recommending should be sturdy enough to last a few years. Affordable systems will also be heavier and thicker than mid-range and premium models, and they typically don't have great battery life. These are worthwhile trade offs if you're looking to save money, though, and even the priciest gaming laptops struggle with battery life.</p><h2>Best overall: Dell G15</h2><p></p><p>Dell was one of the first PC makers to combine a decent amount of gaming power in a sub-$1,000 system. The <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=b1bb23c9-a2d4-4e4e-bfac-7a560ebe7641&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Dell&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJiMWJiMjNjOS1hMmQ0LTRlNGUtYmZhYy03YTU2MGViZTc2NDEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGVsbC5jb20vZW4tdXMvc2hvcC9kZWxsLWxhcHRvcHMvbmV3LWcxNS1nYW1pbmctbGFwdG9wL3NwZC9nLXNlcmllcy0xNS01NTMwLWxhcHRvcC91c2VnaGJ0czU1MzBnZ2ptIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhYmFiOWFiNi0xZTcxLTRmZWQtODJhZC05ZTEyM2VhOGY4MGMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARTteuZsKAKSv7h_hgYIpvODz8zDhBLaI3ywzUYPz8Ds&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fdell-laptops%2Fnew-g15-gaming-laptop%2Fspd%2Fg-series-15-5530-laptop%2Fuseghbts5530ggjm">latest G15</a> builds on that experience. It starts at $800 with Intel's 13th-gen i5-13450HX, an RTX 3050 GPU and 8GB of RAM.

## Spotify may finally be ready to launch a premium HiFi audio tier

<p>Rumors about a Spotify HiFi tier have been around since <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-03-01-spotify-hi-fi-leak.html">at least 2017</a>, and the company even <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-hifi-select-markets-premium-cd-quality-audio-2021-165438547.html">announced plans</a> to launch such a feature in 2021 — only to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-hifi-select-markets-premium-cd-quality-audio-2021-165438547.html">back off</a> the next year. Now, the company may finally be ready to launch a high-fidelity plan (dubbed &quot;Supremium&quot; internally) that would be its most expensive tier, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-20/spotify-plans-new-premium-tier-expected-to-include-hifi-audio"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The aim would be to drive more revenue and address investor demands that it raise its prices. Spotify reportedly delayed rolling out the plan back in 2021 as two of its primary rivals, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-lossless-dolby-atmos-131659010.html">Apple Music</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-music-unlimited-plans-hd-streaming-included-135249659.html">Amazon Music</a>, started including the feature for no charge in their standard plans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition, Spotify may enhance its regular Premium offering with expanded audiobook access, either through a certain number of free hours per month or a specific number of books (with an option to purchase more). Audiobooks are currently only available on Spotify via individual purchases.&nbsp;</p><p>There's no word on whether audio would be lossless at up to 24-bit and 192kHz, as it is on Apple Music and Amazon Music. Lossless audio generally doesn't work on Bluetooth speakers or headphones (including Apple's AirPods and AirPods Max), due to the high bandwidth, so users need a wired or WiFi setup.</p><p>Pricing hasn't been revealed, either. Spotify has kept its Premium plan at $9.99/month in the US, unlike Apple and Amazon, which raised their rates to $10.99. CEO Daniel Ek said in a recent earnings call that the company tries to balance subscriber growth with revenue, so pricing varies by region depending on which of those it's trying to boost. Earlier this month, the company announced that it would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-is-laying-off-200-employees-from-its-podcast-division-134749721.html">cut its staff by two percent</a>, after laying off <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-will-lay-off-6-percent-of-employees-130337498.html">six percent</a> of its workforce in January.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/spotify-may-finally-be-ready-to-launch-a-premium-hifi-audio-tier-123847826.html?src=rss

## Trevor Noah is launching a weekly talk show podcast on Spotify

<p>Following his departure as host of <em>The Daily Show</em> last December, Trevor Noah is partnering with Spotify to launch a podcast, <a href="https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/trevor-noah-spotify-podcast-1235648617/"><em>Variety</em> first reported</a>. Weekly episodes of the yet-to-be-named series should feature &quot;<a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-06-20/trevor-noah-hosts-spotify-original-podcast-comedy-launching-2023/">in-depth and freewheeling</a>&quot; discussions with influential figures across the globe.&nbsp;</p><p>The announcement came during a conversation between Noah and Spotify co-founder and CEO Daniel Ek at the Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity about connecting with audiences as a creator. Noah said he is excited to &quot;engage in interesting and meaningful conversations with some of the world's most fascinating people. We'll also probably fix every single issue humankind has ever faced so you definitely want to join us for every episode.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Noah credited the ability to record a podcast from anywhere in the world as one of the things that attracted him to the medium. The sentiment reflects part of his <a href="https://money.yahoo.com/trevor-noah-net-worth-no-180008925.html">reasoning behind leaving <em>The Daily Show</em></a> after seven years: &quot;I miss learning other languages and going to other countries and putting on shows. I miss just being everywhere, doing everything.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>The news comes only days after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-ends-its-podcast-deal-with-harry-and-meghan-142710519.html">Spotify and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex parted ways</a>. The reported $25 million deal led to the creation of a single podcast in three years, <em>Archetypes</em>. Over 12 episodes, Meghan Markle interviewed well-known figures — including Noah — about the stereotypes women face. Unlike <em>Archetypes</em>, which was exclusive to Spotify, Noah's upcoming podcast will be available on other platforms.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/trevor-noah-is-launching-a-weekly-talk-show-podcast-on-spotify-113516329.html?src=rss

## The Morning After: The verdict on Google’s Pixel Tablet

## Philips Hue lights are getting brightness balancing and better motion sensor automations

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/philips-hue/">Philips Hue</a> is introducing some new features that make it easier to match brightness levels on different lights and fine-tune motion sensor automation, manufacturer Signify <a href="https://www.signify.com/en-gb/our-company/news/press-releases/2023/20230620-from-big-to-small-philips-hue-continuously-innovates-to-help-you-personalize-your-home">announced</a>. The company also unveiled three new lighting products, including a bulb and two panels, though only in the UK, it appears.&nbsp;</p><p>The first update is called brightness balancer, developed in response user requests. If you have multiple lights in the same room with different brightness levels, the feature makes it easier to balance them by dimming bright lights more than dim lights. That allows users to create even lighting or &quot;decide which part of the room gets the spotlight when you are syncing to your TV, movies, games or music,&quot; Philips said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The other feature enhances the functionality of Philips Hue motion sensors. Right now, the Philips Hue bridge app only supports two time slots for automating light conditions when a sensor detects movement, for instance cool in the morning and warm in the evening. With the update, you'll be able to customize lighting conditions based on motion sensors with a total of 10 times lots when motion is detected. &quot;The natural light scene can be selected as part of these time slots, to mimic the sun throughout the day,&quot; the company noted.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="Philips Hue lights are getting brightness balancing and better motion sensor automations" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/106970d0-0f50-11ee-9eff-42b0fb29d0b9" style="height: 1456px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Philips</div></figure><p>In the UK, Philips also introduced the E14 luster bulb (£30 for a 1-pack or £55 for a 3-pack), based on its smallest golf ball-sized bulb, offering millions of shades of white and color light. It also has a pair of new panel lights, the Surimu panel starting at £210 for the 300x300mm model, along with the Aurelle (above) in black, priced at £150 for a 300x300 panel. All of the lights arrive today in the UK, and the new Hue Bridge features are set to launch in Q3 2023.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/philips-hue-lights-are-getting-brightness-balancing-and-better-motion-sensor-automations-105005772.html?src=rss

Kwon has been found guilty on charges of forging official documents and sentenced to four months in jail after a late March arrest while trying to board a flight to Dubai from Podgorica Airport with fake Costa Rican passports, local newspaper <a href="https://www.vijesti.me/vijesti/crna-hronika/661784/do-kvon-i-hond-can-jun-osudjeni-na-po-cetiri-mjeseca-zatvora"><em>Vijesti </em>reported</a>. Han Chang-joon, Terraform Labs' former finance officer, was also charged and sentenced on the same count. The pair were also found to have forged Belgian passports in their luggage, as well as computers sought by both the South Korean and US authorities.&nbsp;</p><p>Kwon and his associates marketed TerraUSD and Luna as stablecoins pegged to the US dollar, purportedly giving them more, well, <em>stability</em>. They <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-morning-after-the-world-of-cryptocurrency-continues-to-wobble-111526550.html">collapsed in May 2022</a> and took many of their investors' life savings along with them, with these individuals subsequently filing complaints that Kwon had run a Ponzi scheme. South Korea first announced an arrest warrant against Kwon and five associates last September, but he, his family and some of Terraform Labs' finance employees had already fled to Singapore, where the company had registered. Interpol soon put Kwon on the &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/south-korean-prosecutors-interpol-terraform-labs-ceo-do-kwon-060719940.html">red notice</a>&quot; list at the request of Korean authorities, signaling law enforcement worldwide to arrest him. Montenegrin authorities cited this as another reason for arresting Kwon.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-32">charged Kwon</a> in February with failing to &quot;provide the public with full, fair, and truthful disclosure as required for a host of crypto asset securities, most notably for LUNA and Terra USD. We also allege that they committed fraud by repeating false and misleading statements to build trust before causing devastating losses for investors.&quot; The US District Court in Manhattan publicly released an indictment against Kwon with eight counts, including securities fraud and conspiracy, following his arrest.&nbsp;</p><p>Though Montenegro doesn't have extradition treaties with the US or South Korea, the idea is still on the table. The four-month jail sentence comes shortly after Montenegrin authorities increased their custody stay by six months while determining if and how to proceed with the two nation's extradition requests.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/terraform-labs-founder-do-kwon-handed-four-month-sentence-in-montenegro-100507468.html?src=rss

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/vimeo-will-stop-supporting-its-tv-apps-on-june-27th-194846561.html">Vimeo</a> is one of the latest companies to <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=7d99dc20-7530-4df8-98e2-2f910e52ec89&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Vimeo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI3ZDk5ZGMyMC03NTMwLTRkZjgtOThlMi0yZjkxMGU1MmVjODkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly92aW1lby5jb20vY2FtcGFpZ25zL29uZS10YWtlLXZpZGVvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmMGFhZmJiNy01N2U1LTQ0MmQtOTNmNC04OTMxNmI3ZGM5YjAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAASIuHPgG1CdwhCxbugBM7dw6y_nw4p_pUdE7pbeGuFhW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2Fcampaigns%2Fone-take-video">launch AI-powered tools</a> of its own, and as you'd expect, they're geared towards making it easier for creators to edit their videos. The video hosting platform says most people "lack the skills, time, or resources to effectively create and edit videos," and these features are meant to eliminate those barriers.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps the most useful of the three new AI tools is the text-based video editor that can automatically delete long pauses and parts of the video with filler words, such as "um" and "ah," with just a single click. Users will also be able to easily remove any part of the video they want by searching for certain words in the transcript that the tool generates and then clicking delete. If they want to create short clips for social media, they can search the transcript for a specific word, highlight and right-click on the word, sentence or paragraph, and then select "keep only this."</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Vimeo has also launched a script generator that can conjure a full script based on a text prompt written by the user, the intended video length and the "tone" (such as confident, funny or casual) they choose. According to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/19/vimeo-introduces-a-trio-of-ai-powered-editing-features/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a>, it's powered by OpenAI's GPT technology, made into a part of the editing suite through its API. Finally, the company has introduced an on-screen teleprompter that can display scripts with the font size and the pacing the user sets. It could help creators stay on script while maintaining eye contact with the camera.</p><p>All three tools will be available in July as part of Vimeo's Standard and Pro subscription plans. While users can test them as part of those plans' seven-day trial period, they ultimately have to pay at least $20 a month (when billed annually) to be able to keep using them.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="A screenshot of Vimeo's text-based video editor.

<p>With a new update, WhatsApp wants to make spam calls less annoying and let users select the optimal privacy settings, the company <a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/new-privacy-features-silence-unknown-callers-and-privacy-checkup">announced</a>. The first feature, called Silence Unknown Callers, does exactly that — the calls won't ring on your phone, but will appear in your call list, in case the call is important but you have to respond. For most users, that should offer a decent blend of practicality and privacy.&nbsp;</p><p>And speaking of privacy, WhatsApp also introduced a feature called Privacy Checkup. &quot;Selecting ‘Start checkup’ in your Privacy settings will navigate you through multiple privacy layers that strengthen security of your messages, calls, and personal information,&quot; the company said. Doing so provides options like &quot;Choose who can contact you,&quot; &quot;Control your personal info,&quot; &quot;Add more privacy to your chats&quot; and &quot;Add more protection to your account.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="WhatsApp's new privacy features include the silencing of unknown callers" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/551543b0-0f3e-11ee-bffd-039a3610fee9" style="height: 4321px; width: 7680px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">WhatsApp</div></figure><p>WhatsApp also released an emotional new video encouraging users to check in on friends they may be concerned about. The company even provides a template: &quot;Hey, I've been thinking about you. I'm here if you need to chat. No one else can see this but us. And you can also turn on disappearing mode or use the chat lock feature.&quot; It's a way for WhatsApp to promote key privacy features — chat lock was just <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapps-new-privacy-feature-locks-sensitive-chats-and-hides-them-from-notifications-181005512.html">introduced last month</a>, for example.

## Google Pixel Tablet review: Clever accessories transform an unexciting tablet

<p>The Pixel Tablet is like an emotionally unstable partner. On good days, it’s reliable and helpful, always ready to listen and support me. Every now and then, though, I feel gaslit and annoyed by its inconsistencies and mixed messages. This might be because Google’s latest tablet/smart-display hybrid straddles two product categories: one at which it excels and another where it’s just adequate. As a smart display, the Pixel Tablet mostly shines. It has a useful dashboard, an easy-to-read interface and impressive audio quality. As a tablet, it’s decent, but doesn’t blow me away. Throw in the case that Google made though, and it immediately becomes more versatile. At $500 with an included charging speaker base, the Pixel Tablet is a compelling marriage of two products with a reasonable price.</p><h3>Hardware and design</h3><p>If we do the math, since you can buy additional speaker docks for $120 each, this means the tablet basically costs $380. But it certainly doesn’t <em>feel</em> like a sub-$400 device. While the nano-ceramic coating isn’t outstanding to look at, it lends a glass-like sensation to the back that makes it feel more expensive. Impressively, the Pixel Tablet manages to weigh just 1.09 pounds (493 grams), making it lighter than the Galaxy Tab S8 and the OnePlus Pad. Though, it’s still heavier than the iPad Air.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The review unit Google sent was the Rose color option, which is pleasant and inoffensive. It’s the most exciting out of the three colors (black and white being the other two, so that’s not saying much), and it blends (or blands) well with my living space. I prefer the green hue of the OnePlus Pad, but it’s worth noting that when I handed the Pixel Tablet to my colleague Nathan Ingraham, who recently reviewed the $480 OnePlus Pad, he thought Google’s device felt more premium.</p><figure><img alt="Side view of the Pixel Tablet on a walnut dresser, showing the USB-C port on its left edge. It's docked on the speaker base, with its protective case on." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/2afd92b0-0f22-11ee-9fbd-cf12a1e1d5d2" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>What really sets the Pixel Tablet apart from other recent Android slates is the fact that it’s designed to attach to a charging speaker base and double as a smart display. Now, let’s not forget other devices do this, primarily numerous <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-28-amazon-fire-hd-10-for-kids-show-mode-dock.html">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-08-lenovo-smart-tab-hands-on.html">Lenovo</a> tablets with a Show mode that turns them into Alexa-enabled screens. But it’s a first for the Google ecosystem.</p><p>Before I get to how the Pixel Tablet works as a smart display, though, a quick word on its appearance. If you’ve seen one Google Home product, you’ve basically seen them all. The Pixel Tablet, when docked on the speaker, looks almost exactly like the Nest Hub Max. It has the same rounded rectangle shape, white bezel surrounding the 11-inch screen and the base has a similar mesh fabric covering to the rest of the company’s smart home products. Again, it’s inoffensive and pleasant but doesn’t stir my heart the way a West Elm or Article ornament does. (I know, I’m basic.)</p><h3>As a smart display</h3><p>I was excited to stick the Pixel Tablet on the chest of drawers (from Article) in my bedroom so I could watch shows on it instead of having to buy a second TV or play them on my phone. Google cautioned against having multiple Assistant-enabled devices in one room, and I should have disconnected the Nest Mini speaker I already had on my nightstand. But it didn’t create too many problems during the few days I had them both in there – when I said “Hey Google” while standing nearer the small speaker, the volume of the video playing on the Pixel Tablet dipped so I could be heard more clearly.</p><p>After a week, I can now confidently remove the Nest Mini. Not only is the Pixel Tablet adept at hearing my commands, it also offers much better audio quality and is simply more useful. That’s kind of an obvious statement – of course, a display would be more versatile than a speaker alone. But I’m surprised at the improvement in sound from the speaker dock, since it’s not much bigger than the Mini. It provided ample bass in my endless binging of The Weeknd and Jay Chou playlists, while trebles and voices sounded crisp.</p><figure><img alt="The Pixel Tablet on a walnut dresser, with various items behind it. The top two drawers are in view." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/4cb57850-0f22-11ee-9bff-58fae9e71438" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>I’m not the sort of person to hover in front of a smart display to fiddle with my connected home controls, nor do I have people over often enough that I need some kind of guest-friendly interface to turn on my lights. For those who do, though, the Pixel Tablet’s Hub Mode is likely very useful. Tapping on the house icon at the bottom left of the lock screen brings up a dashboard showing all devices in your home, and you’ll be able to monitor your camera feeds, switch lamps on and more. Guests will also be able to ask the Assistant to set timers, alarms, play music and more without needing to unlock your tablet, as long as you’ve set the permissions properly.</p><p>Lack of visitors aside, it’s easy to see things on the Pixel Tablet’s screen whenever I set foot in my room, no matter how dark or bright it is. At night, the display goes into a dim mode that shows the time in large font but isn’t so bright that it burns your retinas. Since my dresser is in the furthest corner away from the door, it’s nice not to have to squint to see info like the time, countdowns or the temperature. And like a true narcissist, I also set the Pixel Tablet to show a rotating stream of photos of my favorite people (mostly me).</p><p>Not that any of this is unique to the Pixel Tablet, by the way. The Nest Hub Max has similarly larger fonts for timers and other info, and the photo frame feature is basically a staple of any smart display.</p><p>Back to the main thing I wanted to use this tablet for, though: as a TV substitute. Since it’s the first tablet to be a Chromecast receiver, the Pixel Tablet can be controlled remotely with your phone as it streams from apps like YouTube, Disney+, Hulu and more. Of course, other larger smart displays like the Nest Hub Max can also do this, and since this doesn’t work on the Pixel Tablet when it’s not docked, it’s not really a <em>tablet</em> you can cast to. We’re getting really technical with definitions here, but in practical use, it means you can’t cast to the Pixel Tablet when you have it hanging or propped up elsewhere in your home, for example. It’s not a problem, but it limits the versatility of this feature.</p><figure><img alt="Side view of the Pixel Tablet, showing two photos on its screen as part of the photo frame feature." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/8251fce0-0f22-11ee-95a7-6b99a548653e" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>Interestingly, Netflix doesn’t support Chromecasting to the tablet, unlike the other apps. It’s all the more strange considering it works on Google’s other larger smart displays. I also encountered a bug where YouTube refused to cast videos from a specific channel, saying they weren’t allowed when I was in Restricted mode. But none of the devices I was logged into had that setting enabled. Other reviewers I spoke to didn’t have this issue, so this might be a bug specific to my setup.</p><p>It did infuriate me though, because it’s easier to Chromecast my favorite commentary videos since I can skip ads or add more titles without having to drag myself out of bed. Sadly, I had to do just that since I ended up playing them via the native YouTube app. My hatred for this bug grew each time I had to get out and hit “Skip ads” on the screen. (No, you won’t convince me to get YouTube Premium.) This small bug aside, though, Chromecasting is a nice touch on the Pixel Tablet, even if it isn’t unique.</p><p>I have multiple Google Home products in my apartment, and some of my issues with the Pixel Tablet as a smart display are ecosystem-wide instead of specific to the device. For instance, when I set up an Automation through the Home app, I wanted it so that saying “I’m home” would start a playlist on the pair of Nest Audios in my living room. However, at the moment only the device that heard you can be the one playing the music. You can’t decide which of your connected speakers does the action.</p><p>Depending on the way your home is set up, like if you have a Mini in your entryway and prefer your beefier living room system to be the output, this might be frustrating. Luckily for me, the correct devices heard me most of the time, and I almost always got my desired outcome.</p><figure><img alt="The Pixel Tablet on a walnut dresser showing the smart home dashboard in Hub Mode." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/a5116770-0f22-11ee-bfbf-9c59a505056f" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>That’s more of a complaint about Google’s smart home system instead of just the Pixel Tablet, which frankly I am pretty happy with. Not only is it a good connected display, but it’s also useful as a second screen when sat next to my laptop.</p><p>Since it runs full Android, I can have apps like Solitaire or Slack open on it while I work on a review. You can also take video calls through Meet, Zoom, Teams or more, using the 8-megapixel webcam up top. The angle at which the speaker dock props up the tablet makes for a very unflattering shot, though. To mitigate that, Google built in an auto-framing feature that kicks in whenever you take a Meet call while connected to the base. It only works with Meet, though, so you’ll have to rely on third-party apps to provide their own solutions.</p><p>I found that removing the tablet and propping it up with the kickstand on Google’s case made for the best view. In fact, I’m pretty much in love with this accessory.</p><section><img alt="The Pixel Tablet on a walnut dresser propped up by the silver kickstand on the back of its protective case. " class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/c91befa0-0f22-11ee-bf6b-e6e0783a7061" /></section><h3>As a tablet</h3><p>Look, a kickstand on a tablet isn’t a groundbreaking concept. Lenovo made tablets with built-in stands that also worked as hangers years ago, while Surface devices have featured similar mechanisms for ages. But neither Lenovo’s Yoga Tablet nor any of the Surfaces doubled as smart displays. Google was also thoughtful enough to build the kickstand so that it wouldn’t get in the way of attaching the tablet to the speaker. In fact, the ring-shaped kickstand almost perfectly encircles the dock when folded into the case.</p><p>What I love about the kickstand-hanger-combo is that it allows you to place the Tablet pretty much anywhere. So when I want to hang it off a kitchen cabinet to follow along with a recipe video or keep watching <em>Love Is Blind</em> for example, I can. And though the 2,560 x 1,600 LCD panel isn’t as vibrant as the OLED on Samsung’s Galaxy Tabs, it still produced crisp details and colorful images.</p><p>I’ve waxed poetic about the case, but it’s not without flaws. The way it wraps around the power button makes accessing the fingerprint sensor difficult. The cases Google sent us for review are pre-production samples, though, so it’s possible the company will improve this before launch.</p><p>I also played endless rounds of Solitaire with the tablet propped up on my table while I had dinner and watched TV. That’s honestly what most tablets are good for – entertainment – , but often not much else. Google does offer some multitasking features in Android, but it doesn’t make a keyboard specifically for the Pixel Tablet.</p><figure><img alt="The Pixel Tablet with its protective case on and docked on the speaker base. Its silver kickstand, which is folded in, is a ring that circles the speaker." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/ff448790-0f22-11ee-bffa-912737b93bdc" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>You can connect your own Bluetooth keyboard, of course, but Android L still isn’t the best platform for productivity. Yes, you can run two apps side by side or drag and drop pictures between things like WhatsApp and Gmail. And plenty of first-party and third-party apps support this feature and are now optimized for larger screens. But quirks persist.</p><p>When you drag the vertical divider to resize apps, for example, you’ll sometimes need to relaunch them. It happens often when you shrink something down from taking up half the screen to about a third. The system will ask you to tap a button to re-open it, at which point it changes to the smartphone version. Thankfully, relaunching an app doesn’t take long, and when I had to do this with the New York Times crossword, it opened again exactly where I left off instead of forcing me to start over from the home page.</p><p>The new taskbar that Google introduced on the Pixel Tablet makes it easier to launch apps in split screen, though the gesture takes a bit to get used to. Like the row of predicted apps in the Android app drawer, this taskbar will study your habits and over time, start to surface things it suspects you want.</p><p>Another thing that the Pixel Tablet might be good for, in theory, is drawing and taking notes. Though Google does make a $30 stylus for the device, it did not send samples along with review units, so I wasn’t able to test it for this review.</p><p>Here’s the thing: I barely used the Pixel Tablet undocked. I rarely felt the need to pick it up, unless my phone was dead and I wanted to play more Solitaire. The upside of always placing the Tablet on its dock is that when I do want a larger screen for reading, more immersive gaming or watching movies on the go, the Tablet is always charged and ready for me.</p><figure><img alt="A close up of the power button on the Pixel Tablet, which is covered in its protective case." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/2fe78c80-0f23-11ee-9ebf-e0173cdb2c69" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>Because of that, it was challenging to get a real sense of the day-to-day battery life. Whenever I was done with the few moments I needed the device, I instinctively placed it back on the dock, where it would slowly juice back up.</p><p>When you do need the tablet to last you longer than a few moments in your home, though, it's more than up to the task. On our video rundown battery test, the Pixel Tablet clocked 21 and a half hours at 50 percent brightness, which is more than the longest international nonstop flights.</p><p>If you ever do run out of juice, it takes the Pixel Tablet about three hours to get back to fully charged if you use a cable. On the speaker dock, Google optimizes charging to preserve battery life, maintaining it at about 90 percent instead of fully topping it off. I haven’t measured if the charging speed here is slower than with a wire, especially since I’m not usually in a hurry to pick the tablet back up after docking it.</p><h3>Wrap-up</h3><p>Maybe Android tablets aren’t dead after all. Maybe all they needed was a dock to call home and kickstand/hanger that made them more functional. But, despite its name, the Pixel Tablet is far less exciting as a tablet than a smart display. With its charging speaker dock and $80 case, Google presents a far more compelling proposition for its latest product. And despite some quirks, I’ve found life with the Pixel Tablet to be enjoyable, and most of its problems seem solvable. I can only hope Google keeps working on it and doesn’t unceremoniously cast the Pixel Tablet into its graveyard of unloved products. With some software updates, there’s a potentially bright future for the Pixel Tablet.</p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-tablet-review-clever-accessories-transform-an-unexciting-tablet-070147119.html?src=rss

In addition, Opera One can generate contextual prompts for Aria when you right click or highlighting text in the browser. If you prefer to use ChatGPT or ChatSonic, you can <a href="https://www.engadget.com/opera-adds-chatgpt-and-ai-prompts-into-its-browser-113500436.html">access those from the Opera One sidebar too</a>.</p><p>Opera says users don't have to engage with the browser's AI features if they don't want to. For one thing, you'll need to be logged into an Opera account to use Aria.</p><div id="8d04faaa2c1140b9994e913d7324c544"></div><p>Additionally, Opera One has a fresh look based on modular design principles. Opera says this will help the browser adapt to users' needs by surfacing key features. "The relevant modules within Opera One will adjust automatically based on context, providing the user with a more liquid and effortless browsing experience," it wrote in a blog post.</p><p>Opera is hoping to clean up tab clutter as well with a feature it calls tab islands. Opera One uses context to group related tabs together such as hotels and routes you might be looking at for a trip itinerary, or all the Google Docs you have open for a work project.</p><p>Meanwhile, Opera has retooled the browser under the hood. It employed a new architecture with a multithreaded compositor in the aim of offering a faster and smoother user interface. The company says this approach will also help it add new features and make Opera One stand out from other browsers based on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/chromium/">Chromium</a>. It said more AI-focused updates are in the pipeline for later this year.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/operas-generative-ai-infused-browser-is-ready-for-the-masses-070013098.html?src=rss

<p>Sennheiser is the next big brand to offer <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fda-final-rule-over-the-counter-hearing-aids-162735934.html">over-the-counter hearing aids</a>, and it's clearly aiming at people who are already fans of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-3-earbuds-announced-220016884.html">personal audio hardware</a>. The newly <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=70a41cf2-0944-4b2e-9fdd-51f91494e8aa&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sennheiser&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI3MGE0MWNmMi0wOTQ0LTRiMmUtOWZkZC01MWY5MTQ5NGU4YWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9lbi11cy5zZW5uaGVpc2VyLmNvbS9uZXdzcm9vbS9oZWFyLXRoZXJlLWFuZC1ldmVyeXdoZXJlIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI5MjA1NDBiNS0yOTI3LTRlYmQtYTE5OC0yZmRmODM4MTY3ODkifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAbWOwqArmC4bcIJ7LMNjSlhKdg0hXn3NVqm8AIEY3pW2&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fen-us.sennheiser.com%2Fnewsroom%2Fhear-there-and-everywhere">introduced</a> All-Day Clear (shown below) and All-Day Clear Slim (above) both include a charging case that behaves much like those you'd get with the Momentum True Wireless line or other Bluetooth earbuds. While the aids last up to 16 hours on a charge, this should save you hassles when it's time to top up.</p><p>Not surprisingly, Sennheiser claims strong audio quality with smart scene detection that optimizes voices based on the environment. You can customize the sound for your hearing levels through a mobile app within five minutes, the company says. And if you're ready to tune others out, you can listen to music like you would with regular wireless earbuds.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Sennheiser All-Day Clear hearing aids" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/58e21e10-0ed9-11ee-bfd5-b1da2082cb7f" style="height: 1280px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sennheiser</div></figure><p>Your choice mainly comes down to dimensions and price. The hearing aids will be available in mid-July starting at $1,400 for the standard All-Day Clear, and $1,500 for the All-Day Clear Slim. An In-Clinic Care Package will also be available if you'd still like professional help.</p><p>These aren't the most affordable or compact over-the-counter hearing aids. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-unveils-1000-over-the-counter-hearing-aids-131152865.html">Sony's CRE-C10</a>, for instance, is billed as one of the smallest options on the market and delivers up to 70 hours of battery life. Lexie's Bose-powered B1 currently costs $849. Sennheiser's devices are still far less expensive than prescription models (typically $1,000 or more per ear), mind you, and may be worth the extra outlay if the quality matches the brand's reputation.</p><p>The launch isn't surprising, at least. Sennheiser <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sennheiser-consumer-division-sale-to-sonova-104559209.html">sold its consumer audio business</a> to Sonova, a hearing aid specialist, in 2021. This was meant to expand Sonova's audience to a younger crowd while giving Sennheiser the chance to focus on its pro products. From now on, the two companies are working together — products like the All-Day Clear can theoretically benefit from the expertise of both firms.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/sennheisers-first-over-the-counter-hearing-aids-come-with-a-modern-charging-case-050001207.html?src=rss
