Kurt loves VR gaming, but it makes him feel very sick, very quickly. Is there a cure? Kurt's been trying to find it for an entire year.

Nothing feels as cool as full-immersion VR but, for many people, motion sickness spoils the fun. Do a quick search online, and you'll find everyone has their own solution to overcome the dreaded VR motion sickness. What else is there to do other than try them all?

To prepare for the PSVR 2, Kurt has been road-testing cures for VR sickness, from root ginger to waving his arms around like a maniac, with the goal of playing for 30 minutes in full immersion VR using his Meta Quest 2, in games like Resident Evil 4 VR and The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners, without getting sick. 

In this episode of The Kurt Locker, Kurt finds out if any of these cures really work, and wonders if the industry simply need to be better at adapting games to suit every player.
