Translations are also being improved, alongside better calendar entry support and a new mini Google Maps view.</p>\n<p id=\"N2RokU\">The Google Lens support will make searching for objects like plants and clothing a lot easier in Chrome. Currently, you have to use the separate Google app to get access to Lens, but Google is adding this same feature into Chrome in the coming months so you can use existing or new photos to search from the Lens icon in the Chrome address bar on iOS devices.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        \n      <cite>Image:...</cite></figure>\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/20/23766791/google-chrome-ios-search-camera-lens-feature\">Continue reading&hellip;</a>\n  </p>", "link": "https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/20/23766791/google-chrome-ios-search-camera-lens-feature", "date_published": "2023-06-20 16:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "title": "Nomad and Peak Design\u2019s new rugged iPhone 14 case offers both style and substance", "description": "<figure>\n      <img alt=\"The Nomad x Peak Design rugged iPhone 14 Pro case placed against a pile of black slate.\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CF4ZfoakUf678pK5VEf75vel3Yk=/878x610:4688x3150/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/72385624/DSC05416_Edit_10.0.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption><em>The new Nomad x Peak Design rugged iPhone 14 Pro case is designed to take a beating and support Peak Design\u2019s range of SlimLink mounts.</em> | Image: Nomad / Peak Design</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p id=\"QGC6UR\">If you\u2019re in the market for a rugged iPhone 14 Pro case with a little utility, then you\u2019re in luck.
