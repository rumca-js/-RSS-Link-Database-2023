Or running a restaurant without looking at the price of your ingredients. Or constructing homes without looking at the price of raw materials... you get the idea.<p>That lack of transparency would be frightening, but hey, things could still work out, right?<p>Well, let's up the difficulty.<p>Imagine that, on top of not knowing exactly how much you were paying for your inputs, you also didn't know if you would have consistent and continued access to your wholesaler, your food supplier, or your building materials. That would almost certainly induce high blood pressure, stomach ulcers, and mild insomnia.<p>In the world of private credit (this is basically business credit for the majority of companies), it's not only normal but expected that getting and maintaining access to debt capital (one of the key inputs for running any business!) will be opaque, error-prone, and hard to operationalize. In other words, capital uncertainty is the dismal reality in middle-market finance.<p>Private credit is enormous (add up all the VC dollars spent last year and you'd still be short of the amount of private credit issued over the same period), unavoidable, and broken.<p>That means credit access--the fuel or primary financial input for most medium-sized businesses--is hard to price, access, report on, and predict.<p>And yet it doesn't have to be that way; the data and operational issues of private credit have been solved in other domains (e.g., CRMs for Sales, infrastructure tooling for devs, EMRs for hospitals). What's missing is a software layer for business finance.<p>Finley has built the system of record for private credit. We plug into all borrower source systems and automate reporting and analysis for private credit lenders. The result is full transparency into the cost and availability of capital, which gives businesses newfound financial predictability.<p>We're a team of builders, designers, finance experts, engineers, and systems thinkers from top companies in finance and technology, and we're backed by leading investors like Y Combinator, CRV, and Bain Capital Ventures.<p>We're 2.5 years into our journey, recently raised a $17 million Series A, and already managing over $3 billion in private credit.<p>It's still Day 1, though. The challenges we're taking on will reshape the economy over the next decades, and we'd love to partner with team members who share our passion for innovation and company-building.<p>To learn more, check out our Careers page here: <a href=\"https://www.finleycms.com/careers/\">https://www.finleycms.com/careers/</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36410522\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36410522</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36410522", "date_published": "2023-06-20 21:01:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Gear Patrol has acquired DPReview", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/site-news/8298318614/dpreview-com-looks-forward-to-a-new-chapter-with-gear-patrol\">https://www.dpreview.com/site-news/8298318614/dpreview-com-looks-forward-to-a-new-chapter-with-gear-patrol</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36409566\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36409566</a></p>\n<p>Points: 74</p>\n<p># Comments: 8</p>", "link": "https://www.dpreview.com/site-news/8298318614/dpreview-com-looks-forward-to-a-new-chapter-with-gear-patrol", "date_published": "2023-06-20 19:53:26+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Emerging Architectures for LLM Applications", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2023/06/20/emerging-architectures-for-llm-applications/\">https://a16z.com/2023/06/20/emerging-architectures-for-llm-applications/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36409489\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36409489</a></p>\n<p>Points: 13</p>\n<p># Comments: 7</p>", "link": "https://a16z.com/2023/06/20/emerging-architectures-for-llm-applications/", "date_published": "2023-06-20 19:48:12+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Missing Titanic Sub Faced Lawsuit over Depths It Could Safely Travel To", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/post/173802/missing-titanic-sub-faced-lawsuit-depths-safely-travel-oceangate\">https://newrepublic.com/post/173802/missing-titanic-sub-faced-lawsuit-depths-safely-travel-oceangate</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36409475\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36409475</a></p>\n<p>Points: 37</p>\n<p># Comments: 10</p>", "link": "https://newrepublic.com/post/173802/missing-titanic-sub-faced-lawsuit-depths-safely-travel-oceangate", "date_published": "2023-06-20 19:46:06+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "A Bayesian View of Amazon Resellers", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2011/09/27/bayesian-amazon/\">https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2011/09/27/bayesian-amazon/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36409262\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36409262</a></p>\n<p>Points: 10</p>\n<p># Comments: 4</p>", "link": "https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2011/09/27/bayesian-amazon/", "date_published": "2023-06-20 19:30:35+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Show HN: Autolabel, a Python library to label and enrich text data with LLMs", "description": "<p>Hi HN!

It lets you upload your music collection and stores it in Backblaze B2. It provides a simple web interface to listen to your collection, and support for the Subsonic API (allowing native apps to use it). Fundamentally it is not very different from something like Dropbox or Backblaze: it is a \"dumb\" backup that simply stores what you give it. It doesn't perform \"matching\" against other files, it doesn't allow you to access music you didn't explicitly upload, and it doesn't even deduplicate files between different users. It doesn't allow \"sharing\" of music either, download links are tied to a short access token for a specific user's login session. The only difference between other backup services is that we use the metadata tags in your uploads to organize things better. According to Capitol Records, Inc. v. MP3Tunes, LLC, this is absolutely OK in the eyes of the law (thank you to a fellow HN user for telling me about this court case). Note that we don't even perform deduplication, which was the main controversy in that case.<p>I have been using Stripe happily for a couple years now, but suddenly (less than 10 minutes after a subscription payment went through), Stripe decided that I violated their Restricted Business policy, in particular \"Products and services that infringe intellectual property rights: Sales or distribution of music, movies, software, or any other licensed materials without appropriate authorization\". I thought this was a misunderstanding so I clarified that we don't sell music, just storage space (see paragraph above), but they denied my appeal with a short template response.<p>This saddens me because my reasons for starting the site are the exact opposite of piracy! I was sick of artists getting paid virtually nothing for streaming service plays, so I decided to buy full albums directly from the artist as much as I could. inter.tube just allows you to keep your collection safe and easily accessible.<p>I'm posting this mostly to warn other Stripe users that essentially any backup service could \"violate\" these terms, so be careful about the marketing blurbs on your website. Probably any mention of \"music\" whatsoever is enough to get your account nuked. I really liked Stripe, always recommended it because of its nice API, but I won't be doing that anymore.<p>inter.tube will likely die. I'm going to refund my few paying users and disable account registration later, I guess.<p>As a bonus, I've open-sourced inter.tube. However, it is difficult to run because it relies on a bunch of random cloud services (Backblaze B2 + Cloudflare Workers + Lambda) and there's some hard-coded stuff in there, so it's probably not very useful beyond curiosity. If anyone would like to help me with the open sourcing, let me know, and I'll get back to you whenever I have time. Of course, feel free to fork it as well. I am also on GitHub sponsors if anyone would like to sponsor me to help make it easier to self-host (or at least self-deploy).<p>Source code: https://github.com/guregu/intertube</p>\n<hr

We\u2019re Dan and Tony - founders of Inngest (<a href=\"https://www.inngest.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.inngest.com/</a>). Inngest is a developer platform and toolchain for developing, testing and running background jobs, and workflows. Inngest invokes your jobs via HTTP, wherever you want to deploy your code.<p>Shipping reliable background jobs and workflows is a time suck for any software team. They\u2019re painful to develop locally and getting into production is a tedious experience of configuring infra. When you want to add scheduling, orchestrate multi-step workflows or handle concurrency or idempotency, you spend even more time building bespoke systems - not your actual product.<p>Software engineers spend a ton of duplicated effort building and rebuilding this at every company. It shouldn\u2019t be this way.<p>We\u2019ve taken our experience building and scaling reliable, secure queueing systems across Healthcare, B2B SaaS, and developer infra companies. With Inngest, we sought out to create a single platform and set of developer tools to unburden the developer.<p>- You write functions alongside your API, in your existing codebase with our simple SDK. We invoke your functions via HTTPS, so there are no additional worker services to setup.<p>- End-to-end local development, with one command. Our dev server runs Inngest on any machine with a web interface to visualize, debug, and test your functions with zero additional dependencies.<p>- Our serverless queue calls you, so you can run your code anywhere - serverless, servers or edge.<p>- Inngest manages state across functions and long-running workflows for you. We handle retries, concurrency, idempotency, and coordinating parallel and sequential workloads out-of-the-box.<p>We\u2019ve helped users like:<p>- Snaplet.dev uses Inngest to handle the lifecycle of managing preview databases for their developer platform.<p>- Ocoya.com re-build their e-commerce and social media scheduling workflows in days while dramatically simplifying their infra to run solely with Inngest + serverless functions.<p>- Secta.ai uses Inngest to run all of their AI image generation models on GPU-optimized instances.<p>Today, we have a TypeScript SDK and we will expand to other languages soon (Go is next). We\u2019re building in the open on Github and we offer usage-based plans with a generous free tier.<p>We\u2019re excited to share this with HN and we\u2019re eager for your feedback! What are your experiences building systems for background jobs and workflows?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a
