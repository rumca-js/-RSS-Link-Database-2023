DreamWorks Animation dives into the turbulent waters of high school with a hilarious, heartfelt action comedy about a shy teenager who discovers that she’s part of a legendary royal lineage of mythical sea krakens and that her destiny, in the depths of the oceans, is bigger than she ever dreamed.

Sweet, awkward 16-year-old Ruby Gillman (Lana Condor, To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before franchise) is desperate to fit in at Oceanside High, but she mostly just feels invisible.

She’s math-tutoring her skater-boy crush (Jaboukie Young-White, Ralph Breaks the Internet), who only seems to admire her for her fractals, and she’s prevented from hanging out with the cool kids at the beach because her over-protective supermom (Oscar nominee Toni Collette, Knives Out), has forbade Ruby from ever getting in the water.

But when she breaks her mom’s #1 rule, Ruby will discover that she is a direct descendant of the warrior Kraken queens and is destined to inherit the throne from her commanding grandmother (Academy Award winner Jane Fonda), the Warrior Queen of the Seven Seas.

The Kraken are sworn to protect the oceans of the world against the vain, power-hungry mermaids who have been battling with the Kraken for eons. There’s one major, and immediate, problem with that: The school’s beautiful, popular new girl, Chelsea (Emmy winner Annie Murphy, Schitt’s Creek) just happens to be a mermaid. Ruby will ultimately need to embrace who she is and go big to protect those she loves most.

Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken stars an extraordinary cast that includes Emmy winner Colman Domingo (Fear the Walking Dead) as Ruby’s supportive dad, Emmy nominee Sam Richardson (Veep) as Ruby’s enthusiastic uncle and Blue Chapman (Council of Dads) as Ruby’s cool little brother.

Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken opens in theaters June 30.

Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life reviewed by Jess Reyes on Nintendo Switch, also available on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.

"This remake of the Harvest Moon GameCube game is difficult to recommend over other farming sims with more expansive worlds, more interesting stories, and more satisfying progression. Marvelous has admirably updated the graphics and gameplay to cater to a more modern audience, but those improvements only do so much when the heart of it feels as dated as it does. Its standout feature is still the way the town and NPCs impressively adapt and age over the course of its potentially 30-year campaign, but there aren’t enough noteworthy characters or rewards to make you want to stick around that long, either. Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life doesn’t offend, but it sure doesn’t impress either."
