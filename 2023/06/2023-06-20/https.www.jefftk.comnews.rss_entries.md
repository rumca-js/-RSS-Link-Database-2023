I recently came across </span>

<blockquote>
Here's a truth bomb:
<p>
Take the U.S. city you're most afraid of, one with a very high murder
rate or property crime rate.
</p>
<p>
If it has any sort of public transit, it is still statistically safer
to use public transit in that city at ANY time of day than to drive
where you live.

This got ~1M views, doesn't cite anything, was given without any
research, and, I'm pretty sure, is wrong.  While I'm a <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/news/transit">major fan of public transit</a>, they've stacked
this comparison in a way that's really favorable to cars, and it's not
surprising that public transit doesn't make it.

</p>

<p>

Safety is a complicated concept, and risks are situational: in a car
you're much more likely to be hurt in a collision, while on public
transit you're much more likely to be hurt by another passenger. To
get a clear comparison I looked just at deaths, which is also an area
where we can get good statistics.

</p>

<p>

I can't find a listing of public transit agencies by homicide rate,
but Chicago is a large city with a lot of homicides and they make
their data available so let's look there.  In 2022 there were <a href="https://www.transitchicago.com/ridership/">244M</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Transit_Authority">CTA</a>
rides.  Downloading the <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2">Chicago
Police Data</a> and filtering to 2022 homicides on public transit, I
see nine.  This is 3.7 homicides per 100M trips.

</p>

<p>

(Note that the original claim was for any city, and there are dozens
of US cities with homicide rates <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_by_homicide_rate">higher
than Chicago's</a>.  I think it's pretty likely that at least one of
these cities has a public transit system with more homicides than the
CTA.)

</p>

<p>

To fairly compare this to the risk from driving, we need homicides per
distance. How long is a trip?  I can't find 2022 data, but the CTA's
<a href="https://www.transitchicago.com/assets/1/6/FY2020_ADA_(Accesible_Text)_Budget_Book.pdf">President's
2020 Budget Recommendations</a> gives 2.5mi (613M passenger miles
divided by 249 trips).  This means 1.5 homicides per 100M miles
travelled.

</p>

<p>

I live in MA, and while 2022 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatality_Analysis_Reporting_System">FARS</a>
data isn't out yet, in 2021 there were <a href="https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/state-by-state">0.71</a>
driving deaths per 100M miles travelled.  This is a bit less than half
the rate for the CTA.  While MA does happen to be the safest
state for driving, only 14/50 states (30% of the population) have
higher driving fatality rates than the CTA.

</p>

<p>

I'm not sure how to get to a place where we see fewer bold false
claims, but a culture of giving sources, and supporting requests for
them, seems like it would help?
