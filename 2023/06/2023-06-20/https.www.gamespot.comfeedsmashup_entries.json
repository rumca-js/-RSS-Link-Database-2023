[{"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Dan Stevens Will Replace Justin Roiland On Hulu's Solar Opposites", "description": "<p>Hulu has announced its replacement for Justin Roiland's character in the animated show Solar Opposites, according to <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/dan-stevens-replaces-justin-roiland-solar-opposites-1235519696/\">The Hollywood Reporter</a>.</p><p>Dan Stevens (Legion, Downton Abbey) will take over as the voice Korvo, a member of the group of aliens from the planet Shlorp now stranded and having to make a life on Earth. Roiland was fired from the role earlier this year when <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rick-and-morty-co-creator-justin-roiland-faces-felony-domestic-violence-charges/1100-6510537/\">allegations of domestic</a> violence surfaced. THR notes that Stevens also voices a character on the animated comedy Central Park, which is also from 20th Television Animation.</p><p>In addition to Solar Opposites, which Roiland co-created with fellow Rick and Morty alum Mike McMahan, he was also <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/adult-swim-cuts-ties-with-justin-roiland-rick-and-morty-will-continue/1100-6510833/\">fired from his roles as the titular characters of Rick and Morty</a> on the hit Adult Swim show, and <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/justin-roiland-resigns-from-squanch-games-amid-domestic-violence-allegations/1100-6510838/\">resigned from his post</a> at Squanch Games following the release of High On Life. Charges against Roiland were later dismissed by the Orange County District Attorney <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/domestic-violence-case-against-justin-roiland-dismissed/1100-6512621/\">due to insufficient evidence</a>.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dan-stevens-will-replace-justin-roiland-on-hulus-solar-opposites/1100-6515352/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dan-stevens-will-replace-justin-roiland-on-hulus-solar-opposites/1100-6515352/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-06-20 22:01:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Halo Infinite Season 4's New Cosmetics Stand Out Much More Than Usual", "description": "<p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1599/15997278/4155255-halos4thumblarge.jpeg\" /><br /><h3><p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-infinite/\">Halo Infinite</a> Season 4: Infection has arrived, bringing new maps, the fan-favorite Infection mode, and a brand-new cross-season progression system. The new battle pass features 100 tiers of items to unlock and also marks the introduction of premium coats, which are weapon and armor coatings that work across all weapons/armor cores. The new maps include Forest, an Arena map, and Scarr, a new big Team Battle map.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Season 4: Infection battle pass features themed armor sets and coatings. The main armor set is the <strong>Hazmat core</strong>, one of the more distinct-looking armor sets in Halo Infinite. Instead of being primarily metal, the hazmat suit has a more cloth-like look, with a few metal pieces accenting the armor set. The default helmet has a massive visor and a breather, with the default color being the hazmat yellow and black. It's notable given the common complaints about Halo Infinite cosmetics often looking similar to each other.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">For anyone unfamiliar, Infection is a longtime Halo mode, making its return in Halo Infinite Season 4. This mode pits a couple of infected, armed with energy swords, against a bunch of survivors. If a survivor is killed, they respawn as an infected, which continues until the time runs out or there are no survivors left.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinite-overhauls-career-progression-for-season-4-infestation/1100-6514852/\">new career progression</a> gives players a career ranking, similar to rankings found in older Halo titles. This ranking never resets and is meant to indicate just how much Halo Infinite someone has played. Players advance from cadet to general in a single tier--like Bronze--before progressing to the next higher tier, with the pinnacle being the Onyx tier. Similar to previous games, just completing matches will advance your rank, but performing well will move you up the ranks a bit faster.</p><p>Halo Infinite Season 4: Infection also marks the <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinite-loses-story-cutscenes-for-season-4-343-focusing-on-gameplay-features/1100-6515330/\">end of seasonal story cutscenes</a>. 343 Industries revealed that the high-quality story cutscenes that launched alongside each new season would no longer be happening moving forward, due to the development team wanting to focus on higher priority tasks, like making new content for Halo Infinite. For fans waiting to hear more lore about the greater Halo universe, it could be a long time until new Halo story content comes from 343 Industries.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><img

Seeking revenge, Rience brings a group of allies to overpower Ciri. However, thanks to her combat training with Geralt, Ciri manages to hold her ground until help arrives. Notably, Yeneffer and the Dwarves, led by Yarpen Zigrin (Jeremy Crawford), also join the battle, with Jaskier providing support as well.

boss NPC for players to battle, but Tuesday's patch, the first of the season, has added one to the new jungle area of the island. Between this new guy and the vault NPCs we've had around the island for a while now, that's a lot of beefy PvE enemies on the map this season.</p><p>This new boss is called Wildguard Relik--which seems like a pun, considering the vault NPC is named Wildcard, though for what reason I have no clue--and he carries not one, but <em>two</em> Mythics. That makes him well worth a visit, but fortunately, or perhaps unfortunately, he's pretty centrally located.</p><h2>Where to find Fortnite's Wildguard Relik boss</h2><p>With a name like Relik, one of the new named POIs this season makes for a natural fit for him: <strong>Rumble Ruins</strong>. And, indeed, that's exactly where he lives. Like the Ageless Champion at the Citadel two seasons ago, there's no specific spot in the ruins where you can always expect to find him. Instead, he patrols the whole area in and around the large main temple--he doesn't seem to stray far from the temple when he's outside.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-4-season-3-wildguard-relik-boss-guide/1100-6515331/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-4-season-3-wildguard-relik-boss-guide/1100-6515331/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-06-20 16:53:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Netflix Giving Riverdale An Indian Musical Makeover For The Archies Movie", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Netflix has unveiled a teaser trailer for The Archies, an upcoming Indian musical movie inspired by Archie Comics.

Marvel Studios alumni Aaron Taylor-Johnson dons the furs and takes on the role of Sergei Kravinoff, who accidentally gets powers from a transfusion from a mystical lion's blood and becomes a one-man fighting machine against poachers and international terrorists.</p><p>Much like Venom and Morbius, Sony's Kraven sets up a new origin story for the iconic villain and molds him more into an anti-hero. We also get our first look at Oscar winner Ariana DeBose as Kraven's longtime love interest Calypso and a tease at Alessandro Nivola as Aleksei Sytsevich aka The Rhino. Check it out below.</p><div>          </div><p>Created by Steve Ditko and Stan Lee back in Amazing Spider-Man #15, Kraven has since endured as one of the web-slinger's toughest foes. Kraven has also come into conflict with other heroes, such as Black Panther and Tigra. He is also the half-brother of fellow Marvel villain the Chameleon (played by Fred Hechinger) and one of the founding members of the Sinister Six. The movie looks to borrow a lot from his comic book counterpart. Even the teaser poster is an homage from Marco Checchetto's art in Amazing Spider-Man #636.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-band-kraven-the-hunter-trailer-arrives-and-its-a-bloody-wild-time/1100-6515307/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-band-kraven-the-hunter-trailer-arrives-and-its-a-bloody-wild-time/1100-6515307/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-06-20 13:04:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
