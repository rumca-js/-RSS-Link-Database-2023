While I'm a <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/news/transit\">major fan of public transit</a>, they've stacked\nthis comparison in a way that's really favorable to cars, and it's not\nsurprising that public transit doesn't make it.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nSafety is a complicated concept, and risks are situational: in a car\nyou're much more likely to be hurt in a collision, while on public\ntransit you're much more likely to be hurt by another passenger. To\nget a clear comparison I looked just at deaths, which is also an area\nwhere we can get good statistics.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI can't find a listing of public transit agencies by homicide rate,\nbut Chicago is a large city with a lot of homicides and they make\ntheir data available so let's look there.  In 2022 there were <a href=\"https://www.transitchicago.com/ridership/\">244M</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Transit_Authority\">CTA</a>\nrides.  Downloading the <a href=\"https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2\">Chicago\nPolice Data</a> and filtering to 2022 homicides on public transit, I\nsee nine.  This is 3.7 homicides per 100M trips.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n(Note that the original claim was for any city, and there are dozens\nof US cities with homicide rates <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_by_homicide_rate\">higher\nthan Chicago's</a>.  I think it's pretty likely that at least one of\nthese cities has a public transit system with more homicides than the\nCTA.)\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nTo fairly compare this to the risk from driving, we need homicides per\ndistance. How long is a trip?  I can't find 2022 data, but the CTA's\n<a href=\"https://www.transitchicago.com/assets/1/6/FY2020_ADA_(Accesible_Text)_Budget_Book.pdf\">President's\n2020 Budget Recommendations</a> gives 2.5mi (613M passenger miles\ndivided by 249 trips).  This means 1.5 homicides per 100M miles\ntravelled.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI live in MA, and while 2022 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatality_Analysis_Reporting_System\">FARS</a>\ndata isn't out yet, in 2021 there were <a href=\"https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/state-by-state\">0.71</a>\ndriving deaths per 100M miles travelled.  This is a bit less than half\nthe rate for the CTA.  While MA does happen to be the safest\nstate for driving, only 14/50 states (30% of the population) have\nhigher driving fatality rates than the CTA.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI'm not sure how to get to a place where we see fewer bold false\nclaims, but a culture of giving sources, and supporting requests for\nthem, seems like it would help?\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid021Azx1qQRzmEFsUbg1Y6feyLygnknoEvtMPdH6AMC46Udy1gpMVCXXLYcyKEB2FF9l\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://lesswrong.com/posts/Z6RqDAoEGeF2cvxwK\">lesswrong</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@jefftk/110577980608407725\">mastodon</a></i></p>", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/public-transit-is-not-infinitely-safe", "date_published": "2023-06-20 08:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
