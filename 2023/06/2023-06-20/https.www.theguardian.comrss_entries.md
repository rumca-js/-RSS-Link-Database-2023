## Slashed stone, daylight galore and doors by Tracey Emin: the National Portrait Gallery’s £41m rebirth

<p>Forty-five faces of women, scribbled by Emin, now beam out from bronze doors – all part of an astonishing revamp that has turned this once unloved London landmark into a great building</p><p>The National Portrait Gallery in London has always felt like the poor cousin of the National Gallery, an afterthought tucked around the back of the star attraction. It stands as an awkward rear extension, squeezed into an unloved armpit where the sticky chaos of Leicester Square spills into Charing Cross Road, while visitors have always been shuffled through an apologetic side entrance, as if being invited in to collect the bins.<br /><br />The reason it is so unwelcoming is that when the gallery was built in 1896 after its first years in temporary premises, it faced directly on to a slum – “a neighbourhood of crime and vice”, as architectural historian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/apr/21/a-day-with-nikolaus-pevsner-1960">Nikolaus Pevsner</a> put it – and the insalubrious streets of Soho beyond. This regal repository of painted noblemen couldn’t be seen to be fronting on to such a seedy district, so the architect, <a href="https://victorianweb.org/art/architecture/christian/index.html">Ewan Christian</a>, moved the entrance as far around the corner as he could, to face the more seemly setting of St Martin-in-the-Fields church. As a result, the building’s front has always looked like its back, the palazzo-like facade of arched windows and roundels crucially missing a front door.</p><p>Almost 130 years later, three momentous bronze portals have burst through the Grade I-listed stone walls, as part of the most radical transformation in the institution’s history. In the hands of <a href="https://jamiefobertarchitects.com/">Jamie Fobert Architects </a>and heritage specialists <a href="https://www.purcelluk.com/">Purcell</a>, new galleries have been opened up, learning spaces and restaurants added, and a public forecourt created, in a £41.3m process of surgical slicing and stitching, giving the rambling warren a vital new lease of life.<br /><br />“It’s the great building Londoners never knew they had,” says Fobert, standing outside the gallery’s new entrance. “Our job was to open it up, tie its different eras together, and give it a new public face.” As his work at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/27/tate-st-ives-a-stunning-new-gallery-bullied-into-hiding">Tate St Ives</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/feb/02/kettles-yards-rebirth-a-magical-sequence-of-spaces-worth-the-14-year-wait">Kettle’s Yard</a> attests, he is well positioned to accomplish such a task, free of the usual architect’s urge to stamp his own signature too boldly.<br /><br />Where once there was a triangular scrap of fenced-off grass on the street corner, now stretches an inviting public space, providing a moment of pause between the bustle of Trafalgar and Leicester Squares. A chunky granite bench (mercifully free of anti-skating studs and anti-homeless bars) sweeps around an existing statue, echoing the curve of the road and merging into a broad set of stairs, while the pavement slopes up behind, bringing level access to the front door in a way that doesn’t feel like a separate “accessible” ramp. On a recent visit, one wheelchair user asked where the ramp was – only to find they had already glided up it, unawares. It’s a simple move, but one that is worlds away from the former indignity of being sent down a side alley to a separate ramped service entrance.<br /><br />“The idea was to make the experience the same for everyone,” says Fobert, “and intervene in ways that are almost imperceptible.” You probably won’t realise that a hefty concrete platform was craned in to bridge over a sunken lightwell to the new entrance, as the granite paving flows across it seamlessly. More noticeable are the sharply sliced openings, where the architects have taken their scalpel to the base of three windows and slashed through the Portland stone plinth to expose the fresh interior of the rock, in striking contrast to its gnarled outer surface. It leaves the Victorian mouldings playfully truncated, echoing the staccato postmodern facade of Venturi Scott Brown’s National Gallery Sainsbury Wing next door (currently undergoing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jun/19/the-sainsbury-wing-redesign-spare-us-the-art-world-good-taste">its own less sensitive remodelling</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/21/doors-tracey-emin-national-portrait-gallerys-41m-rebirth">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Five tempestuous, hysterical days ended with Australia playing the old-fashioned way until desperation won the day</p><p>Everyone talks about big first hours. That’s because first hours need all the hype they can get. Nobody needs to sell the last hour of a Test match. And particularly not a Test on this epic, colossal, orchestral scale, a Test that shook you from its very first ball and never stopped shaking.</p><p>Take the devastating tension of a tight Twenty20, the ebb and grapple of a really good one-day international, and then make it big.

## Dawn of Royal Ascot’s new era ends in defeat for King Charles and Dettori | Sean Ingle

<p>The monarch’s lukewarm interest in racing will not have been helped by veteran jockey’s ban for careless riding on Saga</p><p>Even on a day when Royal Ascot felt even more awash with bunting than ever, and the top hats and collars were suitably stiff and starched, there was a hint of change in the air. A gentle sense of tradition encountering transition after the death of the sport’s greatest patron, Queen Elizabeth II, last year.<br /><br />It was evident as the royal procession bumpily made its way down the straight before the first race, and the regal waves of the King Charles III were met with gentle – rather than rousing applause – although plenty did tip their hats. The racecards also carried a new royal cypher, bearing the double C for Charles and Camilla.</p><p>It was evident too as the crowds cheered the sport’s most famous jockey, Frankie Dettori, at what will be his final Royal Ascot before he rides off into the sunset. The headline in Tuesday’s Racing Post had proclaimed it to be the Land of Hope and Dettori. But this was one of those afternoons when the magician waves his wand but the rabbit refuses to leave the hat.<br /><br />Mostly, though, Royal Ascot’s unique ecosystem remains as familiar and unaltered as it ever was. A few months ago the Jockey Club announced a relaxation of its dress code to get more people to go racing. But for a place that is a stickler for rules, this was one Ascot was happy to swerve.<br /><br />In the Royal Enclosure, in particular, the clothing restrictions would make a sergeant major wince. Women are told that their dresses and skirts should fall just above the knee or longer – while men are reminded of the need for a waistcoat and necktie, with patterns of a patriotic nature deemed acceptable. Those unsure of where the line is can visit a room by the entrance which is labelled “dress code enquiries.”<br /><br />Some will roll their eyes at this, as well as Ascot’s proud boast that it remains the centrepiece of the British sporting social season. But it is certainly up there. And it would be churlish to deny that it offers a palate that a large-cross section of the British public rather enjoys: dressing up, drinking, royalty and a speculative punt.<br /><br />Taking it all in was Dave Harries, an 80-year-old recording engineer, who said he had been coming to Royal Ascot since the 1960s. “It’s still the place to be,” he insisted, as he showed off his new Panama hat. “It’s about the tradition, the racing, and the fact you can talk to everyone.”<br /><br />As Harries also noted, Charles is rumoured to be no turfite at heart. However for now, at least, he is making the effort. He has promised to be here all week. And before the penultimate race on the first day, he was down in the paddock to run his eye over his horse, Saga, and talk to his jockey, Dettori. He even looked to be giving a passable impression of enjoying himself. But there was to be no winning headline as Saga trudged home in fifth.<br /><br />Afterwards Dettori’s face was etched in frustration, the bookies in delight. For decades, they have been wary of the “Frankie factor”, with multiple wins on the same card turning small stakes into damaging payouts. But there was no chance of that happening on the first day, despite the 52-year-old’s best efforts.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/20/king-charles-royal-ascot-frankie-dettori-horse-racing">Continue reading...</a>

They might argue that it sustained their political rise. Like doctors who say that bleeding the patient will help them recover, the pair claimed that cutting back government spending would produce economic growth. What Britain suffered was more <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/what-do-the-latest-food-bank-statistics-tell-us/" title="">food banks</a>, more rough sleeping, <a href="https://ifs.org.uk/sites/default/files/output_url_files/bn208.pdf" title="">fewer police</a>, stagnant wages and longer <a href="https://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/resource/chart-of-the-week-how-has-the-waiting-list-changed-over-the-years" title="">NHS waiting lists</a>. How could any of this have helped prepare Britain for when the pandemic stuck? Such details weren’t going to shift Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne, who from the witness stand of the Covid-19 public inquiry remain unmoved by reality.</p><p>For Mr Cameron, the former prime minister, it was 2008 all over again. Britain had not wanted to end up like Greece, he <a href="https://covid19.public-inquiry.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/19191608/C-19-Inquiry-19-June-23-Module-1-Day-5.pdf" title="">warned</a>, which had had to cut health budgets after losing control of its national debt and its budget deficit. This is an invidious comparison. Britain, unlike Greece, controls its own currency and can always afford to pay creditors. Greece also had a <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths" title="">much lower per capita death rate</a> than the UK during the pandemic. That might have been because, as experts suggested, of the <a href="https://covid19.public-inquiry.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/16183457/INQ000195843.pdf" title="">widening health inequalities</a> under Mr Cameron’s watch.

<p>Yes, it was unfortunate the former chancellor had let social care collapse, but no one lives for ever</p><p>There were many unsung heroes during the Covid pandemic. The doctors, nurses and paramedics who went that extra mile to treat and comfort the sick and the dying. The care home staff who put themselves in harm’s way knowing they were admitting patients who hadn’t been tested for the coronavirus. The ordinary members of the public who went out of their way to follow the rules even though they knew they might never see relatives or loved ones again.</p><p>But during his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/20/covid-inquiry-britain-remains-wildly-under-resilient">evidence to the Covid inquiry on Tuesday morning</a>, George Osborne went out of his way to praise the efforts of one man without whom the country might never have survived the pandemic. Someone whose name had mysteriously slipped under the public’s radar and yet was worthy of a nation’s gratitude. The former chancellor was here to right that wrong. To allow that someone to be a hero. If only just for one day. And that someone was a certain George Osborne.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/20/george-osborne-sings-praises-of-true-pandemic-hero-himself">Continue reading...</a>

## Shunned, boycotted, exiled: has France treated Françoise Gilot worse than Picasso did?

<p>When she walked out on Picasso, he destroyed her art and waged war on her career – while France cast her out. Now that this great painter has died, says the woman writing her biography, it is time for this shameful treatment to cease</p><p></p><p></p><p>‘As long as I am breathing,” Françoise Gilot once said, “I am painting.” It is no surprise then that the artist, who died earlier this month at the age of 101, has left behind a remarkable body of work: paintings, collages, ceramics, drawings and lithographs as well as poetry and prose – the fruits of a brilliant, 80-year career. Tributes poured out across the globe, as commentators seized the opportunity to reflect on Gilot’s achievements. But it turns out celebrating Gilot’s legacy is a bit of a Pandora’s box because, for 10 years, she was Pablo Picasso’s muse, his lover, the mother of two of his children and – let’s not forget – his artistic companion and intellectual equal. She was also, as Picasso liked to characterise her, “the woman who says no”.</p><p>And therein lies the problem: many of the articles have defined her life as inescapably entwined with his, as if the gold dust emanating from Picasso should be more than enough for any woman artist. Writing in the Guardian, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/12/blatant-sexism-great-painter-francoise-gilot">Katy Hessel</a> rightly asked: “Why is a great painter who lived to 101 still defined by a man she left in the 1950s?” This, thankfully, is part of a growing awareness, a desire to nurture a different kind of art history, one entirely more nuanced and inclusive. The Brooklyn Museum in New York is currently making waves with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/06/hannah-gadsby-picasso-exhibition-brooklyn-museum">It’s Pablo-matic: Picasso According to Hannah Gadsby</a>, a show co-curated by the Australian standup who has attacked the artist in her routine.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/20/shunned-boycotted-exiled-france-francoise-gilot-picasso">Continue reading...</a>

Will the NT reach for a safe pair of hands at a time when arts funding is squeezed and theatre is clawing back revenue lost over the pandemic? Or will it continue Norris’s project of opening up the venue to new audiences and daring to be different? The theatre may well follow the trend for appointing co-directors rather than a single figurehead, to balance risk with tradition. Several high-profile artistic directors have recently left their jobs so there is a lot of talent in the system.

<p>Get to know your spices, use them as a seasoning and keep them in the dark and well away from any heat sources, advises our expert panel</p><ul><li>Got a culinary dilemma? Email <a href="mailto:feast@theguardian.com">feast@theguardian.com</a></li></ul><p><strong>What’s the best way to store and use up spices?</strong><br /><em><strong>Grace, Sheffield</strong></em><br />We all have those trusty spices that we reach for time and again to bring flavour – Heat! Sweetness! Sourness! – to a dish, but there are also those that lurk at the back, unused and unloved. To prevent Grace’s cupboard from becoming a Bart’s history museum (other brands are available), she’s right to ask how best to store them.</p><p>While supermarkets sell spices in jars, it’s best not to keep them this way. “They’ll lose their potency, which is really the singular point of a spice,” says Rachel Walker, founder of <a href="https://rootedspices.com/">Rooted Spices</a> and co-author, alongside Esther Clark, of <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-modern-spice-rack-9781784885793">The Modern Spice Rack</a>. Instead, store them in an opaque container out of direct sunlight and away from heat. “You don’t want them too close to the oven,” she adds, “but equally, if they are tucked away at the back of a cupboard, that’s when you’ll start to forget they exist.” This strategy is also endorsed by Cynthia Shanmugalingam, chef/founder of <a href="https://rambutanlondon.com/">Rambutan</a> in Borough Market, London, who keeps her “embarrassingly huge spice collection” in airtight containers in a cool, dark cupboard. Her top tip, though, is to buy whole spices and a decent small electric spice grinder: “The difference between toasting and grinding your spices fresh is huge.” Plus, they’ll keep longer (typically 12 months, as opposed to six for ground spices). So, in future, buy whole spices little and often.</p><p>Got a culinary dilemma?

<p>The immunologist who runs Scancell is trialling novel treatments to attack tumours, as well as needle-free Covid jabs</p><p>“Cancer is my game,” says Prof Lindy Durrant, an immunologist, founder and chief executive of Scancell, which is developing vaccines that could offer a needle-free protection against Covid as well as novel treatments against cancer. Founded in 1997 on the back of her Nottingham University research, the Oxford-based company’s work on treatments that stimulate the body’s immune system to fight cancer and infectious disease has put it in a cluster of promising British biotechnology firms.</p><p>While most vaccines are taken preventively, there is no jab to avoid cancer (apart from the HPV one for the virus that triggers most cervical cancer). “Probably 50% to 60% of people will get cancer and die of it,” says Durrant. “There are probably 200 different types of cancer. Each of them has a very different signature.

<p>Edward Leigh’s meeting with Hungary’s far-right PM is part of a wider pattern – let’s not be naive about what is going on</p><p>The Conservative MP Sir Edward Leigh earlier this month <a href="https://twitter.com/EdwardLeighMP/status/1664908085788327936">tweeted a picture</a> of him and his colleagues Christopher Chope and Ian Liddell-Grainger – all of them ERG members who drove the Brexit agenda – standing beside Hungary’s far-right prime minister, Viktor Orbán, at a gathering in Budapest. The tweet celebrated the trio “learning about his country’s effective ways of combating illegal migration”.</p><p>Their presence in Budapest, for a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/06/tory-mps-accused-of-cosying-up-to-far-right-hungarian-leader-viktor-orban">conference of parliamentarians</a> from allied hard-right political parties across Europe, could easily be dismissed as fluff. But the spectacle highlights both troubling connections between Britain and Hungary’s governing parties and the wishful thinking of UK Conservatives looking to Orbán‘s Fidesz party for inspiration.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/20/tory-mps-viktor-orban-playbook-british-politics-hungary-edward-leigh">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Menier Chocolate Factory, London<br /></strong>The songs may not compare to the 1949 film’s zither music, but the design amplifies Trevor Nunn’s elegantly shadowy production <strong><br /></strong></p><p>It takes courage to adapt a classic film noir for the stage, especially one with a screenplay by Graham Greene, exquisite black and white cinematography and Orson Welles’ radiant charisma. Some might call it hubristic, even foolish, to add music to the mix.</p><p>The surprise is that this musical version of the 1949 film, directed by Trevor Nunn, does not fall on its face. While the songs pass muster, its triumph is in its monochrome design, which seems like a black and white film come to life.

Past the arena there is a purpose-built town square, a comic book Camden complete with bars, barber and tattoo parlour. A giant crypt houses Hellfest’s official merchandise store. The six-stage event attracts approximately 240,000 black-clad metalheads over four days, and this year hosts rock royalty such as Mötley Crüe, Iron Maiden, Slipknot and Kiss. It’s the food and drink, though, that is a big reason for fans coming back year after year.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/20/slipknot-and-a-chilled-muscadet-hellfest-the-metal-festival-thats-also-a-gastronomic-paradise-clisson">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Comedy queen and director of Plan B talks about contraception, last year’s Dobbs decision and the importance of connection</p><p>It’s not yet noon in Portland when Natalie Morales repairs to a modest Airbnb and plops on to a couch next to a deep-slumbering lap hound named Taco, a very good dog. Morales is filming a feature about veterans with PTSD that’s only pressing on through the writers’ strike because it’s an independent film. Its small budget and tight schedule has Morales on call six days a week. But intense work schedules are nothing new for the 38-year-old multi-hyphenate dark comedy queen, whose deadpan acting credits run from Parks and Recreation to Santa Clarita Diet to The Morning Show. She also stars opposite Jennifer Lawrence in No Hard Feelings, which opened in theaters last weekend.</p><p>Two years ago, after marking her feature directorial debut with Language Lessons (a Zoom dramedy she stars in and wrote with Mark Duplass), Morales was behind the camera again for Plan B – the coming-of-age story about a sheltered high school girl who road trips across South Dakota with her slacker best friend in search of emergency contraception after a regrettable sexual encounter. The film, warmly received by critics, has taken on additional heft in the wake of the supreme court’s overturning Roe v Wade and putting contraceptive care under assault.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/20/actor-natalie-morales-interview-abortion-contraception">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Literary ambition, motherhood and a quietly strained marriage appear in the sweet, soft focus home movies of French author Annie Ernaux</p><p>Annie Ernaux ascended to a new plane of international prominence with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/oct/06/annie-ernaux-wins-the-2022-nobel-prize-in-literature">last year’s Nobel prize for literature</a> and the 2021 Venice Golden Lion for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/20/happening-review-cleverly-structured-and-impeccably-produced-abortion-drama">Audrey Diwan’s movie version of her novel Happening</a>. Now here is a diverting, if minor footnote to her life; with her grownup son David Ernaux-Briot she has curated this presentation of her family’s Super 8 home movies from the early 70s to the early 80s. In this period she was raising two young children and semi-secretly embarking on a literary career whose growing success would put strain on her marriage, although this is one of many things she does not discuss in detail.</p><p>The 1970s were a boom time for 8mm home movies, encouraging a whole generation to think of their childhoods as having really existed in that soft Super 8 focus with its vividly primitivist colour, and meanwhile encouraging generations of film-makers to use Super 8 as shorthand for bygone childhood innocence. Ernaux’s own home movies are as poignant and sweet and boring as anyone else’s, and I was reminded of Gilbert Adair’s dictum that home movies all look like the work of the same eccentric auteur, with the same fetish for clumsy closeups, laborious slow pans and interminable, pointlessly dull establishing shots of scenery or tourist landmarks.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/20/the-super-8-years-review-the-family-life-of-annie-ernaux">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The US novelist shaped the modern idea of the post-apocalypse. Without him, games such as The Last of Us and Red Dead Redemption would not be the same</p><p>Cormac McCarthy, one of the most significant figures in modern American literature, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/13/cormac-mccarthy-dead-novelist">died last week aged 89</a>. While the tributes have mostly come from within the literary world, he had a huge impact upon modern culture as a whole – including video games. McCarthy’s work reshaped the way that the world looks at the post-apocalyptic genre, a flavour of fiction that video games have long called home. And Rockstar’s western opus Red Dead Redemption vividly recalls the Border Trilogy – particularly the twisted figure of Dutch van der Linde.</p><p>The developers of The Last of Us have specifically cited The Road <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2013/08/05/the-last-of-us-interview-part-one/view-all/">as a key influence</a>, and it’s easy to see why Naughty Dog drew upon McCarthy’s parent-child journey across a post-apocalyptic America to inform their own. While the main thrust of the game’s story fits neatly into Joseph Campbell’s monomyth, it is the nihilism and bleakness of The Road that determines its mood. Both feature ruined worlds, full of marauders and cannibals, and Joel’s sickness parallels the Man’s fading condition in the novel. Both endings are bleak, the horrors of the world swallowing characters up bodily and mentally.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jun/20/cormac-mccarthy-the-last-of-us-red-dead-redemption">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Take our quiz to see if you can distinguish between fact and eerily prescient Netflix fiction. Be warned – it’s not easy!</p><p>‘It’s like something out of Black Mirror”. It’s a measure of the Emmy-winning show’s success that this has become a thing that people say about the latest advances in tech. As the dystopian sci-fi series returns to Netflix with five new episodes, it feels just as spookily prescient as ever. The line between speculative futurism and cutting-edge tech is often a fine one.

<p>Work and pensions secretary Mel Stride urges Tories to move on from Partygate report after abstaining from vote</p><p><strong>George Osborne</strong>, the former chancellor, will be giving evidence to the Covid inquiry later this morning. The inquiry is focusing at this stage on how prepared the UK was to deal with a pandemic, and Osborne will be questioned about the impact of austerity.</p><p>He has submitted a 38-page witness statement to the inquiry. It has not been published in full yet, but the committee has released<a href="https://covid19.public-inquiry.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/19184945/INQ000187308_11.pdf"> one page</a> from it, because it was cited during the hearing yesterday, and in it Osborne claims that that his austerity measures, which he describes as “cutting the deficit”, had a “positive” effect on the country’s ability to withstand Covid. He says:</p><p>Reducing the deficit and placing debt as a percentage of GDP on a downward path was also essential to rebuild fiscal space to provide scope to respond to future economic shocks. A responsible approach to repairing the UK’s public finances following the financial crisis was essential. I have no doubt that taking those steps to repair the UK’s public finances in the years following the financial crisis of 2008/09 had a material and positive effect on the UK’s ability to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>From 9am, voters in Rutherglen and Hamilton West will have the chance to sign a petition to recall their MP from Westminster.</p><p>If 10% of the electorate choose to do so – some 8,113 people out of 81,124 – then a by-election will be triggered.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/jun/20/mel-stride-boris-johnson-partygate-report-rishi-sunak-uk-politics-live">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Do you need to wash your T-shirts after every wear? Probably not. What about your knickers? That depends. But more and more people are eschewing detergent to save time, money and the environment</p><p>When Tim, like many of us, started working from home during the Covid pandemic, he developed a more relaxed approach to dressing. This made him consider the time and energy that washing his clothes was costing him. “It was around the time we had our second kid, so I was totally overloaded with things,” he says. “Anything I can cut out of my life I see as a challenge, so laundry was just one less thing to do.” He had already been doing less than many people – a load every week, or sometimes every two – but then he went for an entire year without washing his clothes in the machine.</p><p>These days, Tim, a software engineer, does a wash every six months or so. “Seeing as I don’t have to go to the office any more, I don’t really have a need for clean clothes,” he says. “It doesn’t matter.” On video calls, “people only see me from my head up, and half the time I don’t put my camera on anyway”. He looks clean, if fashionably scruffy, when we speak over such a call. “If there’s some important social event, I’ll make sure I’ve got something nice to wear, but day to day it doesn’t really matter.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/20/the-no-wash-movement-would-you-wear-underpants-for-a-week-without-cleaning-them">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A thrilling examination of what it means to become a mother challenges assumptions in bravura fashion</p><p>M<em>atrescence</em>, the best book I’ve ever read about motherhood, is a delightfully unusual one. For starters, brief passages that lay out the machinations of nature, and many of its horrors, sit around its chapters. We meet eels that endure five life stages and multiple habitats before breeding once and then dying, and black lace-weaver mother spiders who feed their living bodies to their infants.</p><p>“Forty spiderlings, which resemble creamy yellow sea pearls, wander over her nonchalantly, devouring, snacking, nibbling, pulling bits of her flesh into their tiny mouths,” Jones writes, watching a grisly nature video. Spotting a similar spider in her children’s toy box not long after, she’s relieved to find no babies. The whole experience has felt “close to home”. “She’s safe,” she writes. “For now.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/20/matrescence-on-metamorphosis-pregnancy-childbirth-motherhood-by-lucy-jones-review-smashing-motherhood-myths">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Summer-fun-and-slashing tale of camp counsellors in bloody peril has clear cinematic ancestors but the young cast gives it fresh appeal</p><p>This silly but pleasingly jolly horror film offers an update on that perennial staple of the genre: the summer camp beset by a supernatural malignancy. And much like a campfire tale tailor-made to terrify impressionable listeners, this has a streak of self-referentiality that makes it feel ludic as well as lurid. After a 1940s-set prologue that’s explained later, the story settles into the 1980s, a time when this sort of summer-fun-and-slashing package with a large ensemble cast was all the rage (see Sleepaway Camp, The Burning, and of course the Friday the 13th series).</p><p>It’s the last day of the season at Camp Briarbrook, and the assorted kids get ready to head home after one last performance-assembly in the mess hall. The camp counsellors, who predictably span the spectrum from theatre nerds and dweebs to glossy teen beauties ripe for terrorising, are also psyched to spend the night partying once the kids are gone. The camp’s owners – paterfamilias Gilbert McCalister (William Sadler), his daughter (Cara Buono, Dr Miller in Mad Men), and her two sons Shawn (Tyler Elliot Burker) and Peter (Spencer List) – look on indulgently, little realising that by the end half of them will be murdered or at least traumatised one way or another. Is the mayhem caused by the undead spirit of camp nurse Agatha (Madeleine Dauer), who bears a grudge for things Gilbert did in the 1940s? Or is there a more quotidian explanation like bears, a hornets’ nest or UFOs?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/20/she-came-from-the-woods-review-80s-teen-horror-friday-the-13th">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The story of an unlikely friendship between a city type and a haughty Frenchman has moments of genuine pathos but doesn’t quite feel real</p><p>This low-key, low-budget portrait of an odd-couple friendship takes a while to get going, and never fully hits its stride – though it has its moments. Director Hugo André plays chef turned food blogger Sacha, a fastidious Frenchman living in London who rents a room in a house. His new landlord and flatmate is city banker Dan (Will Masheter), who seems to slot neatly into the stereotype of macho finance bro. But Dan turns out to have a secret life, dressing up in glittery glam frocks and feather boas, transforming into alter ego Danielle.</p><p>A friendship of sorts develops between the two men, throwing up a couple of nice scenes. When Dan cooks soup, picky gourmand Sacha looks appalled in the way that only a Frenchman can at the claggy dollop of peanut butter slopped into his bowl. There’s a real sweetness, too, in Masheter’s performance as Dan begins to live more openly, tiptoeing into the world of cabaret – and, if nothing else, watching his self-expression blossom is a reminder of how sinister the anti-drag laws are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/15/musicians-anti-drag-laws-protest-lizzo">that are currently sweeping the US</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/20/makeup-review-secret-life-of-a-drag-artist-banker-underpins-tender-friendship-tale">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Using canals, rivers and quiet roads, this cycling and boating break – ‘a holiday not a road race’ – takes riders to beautiful wetland scenery, ancient towns and delicious food</p><p>Ten years ago, while exploring the Renaissance city of Mantua in Lombardy, I bumped into a bunch of cyclists embarking on a “bike and barge” trip all the way to Venice. It sounded like the perfect way to hit the quiet backroads of the little-known Polesine region, which surrounds the Po River and stretches to the Adriatic. Finally, here I am, joining the trip (though in the opposite direction), boarding the Ave Maria, which is moored behind Palladio’s iconic Redentore church on the island of Giudecca. The once rust-encrusted 42-metre transport boat was saved from the scrapheap by local tour operator Girolibero and transformed into a very comfortable 17-cabin floating hotel.</p><p>My 32 fellow passengers are a cosmopolitan crowd: Britons, Berliners, Americans, Canadians and New Zealanders, ranging from a teenage student to sprightly retirees. Unlike me they are experienced cyclists, but the tour leader, Hein Hoefnagels, a superfit 74-year-old Dutchman, reassures me that “this is a holiday not a road race”. We will be travelling at a leisurely pace, covering between 15 and 35 miles a day for eight days with lots of stop-offs (including the fishing port of Chioggia and the ancient town of Adria); the roads are flat – plus there’s the option of an electric bike instead of a touring one.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/jun/20/venice-to-mantua-by-bike-and-boat-along-italys-glorious-po-valley">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The author and musician’s engaging biography of the Gibb brothers explores their idiosyncrasies as well as musical brilliance</p><p>This book contains few new interviews about the “insanely productive” group who sold more than 220m records: it is author-led, meaning we are mainly given Bob Stanley’s opinions about the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/bee-gees">Bee Gees</a>’ music. But there are few people whose opinions I would rather have. Stanley is a highly articulate proponent of pop rather than rock (his previous book was <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/06/lets-do-it-by-bob-stanley-review-a-voyage-through-pops-origins">Let’s Do It: The Birth of Pop</a></em>) and a practitioner himself, with his group <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/saint-etienne">Saint Etienne</a>.</p><p>Pop has come in out of the cold in recent years, Blondie as likely to be pontificated about as Led Zeppelin, but the Bee Gees – who were certainly “pop”, despite evolving through quasi-psychedelia into R&amp;B and disco – remain, as Stanley writes, “othered”, rarely accorded the respect they deserve. And he suggests that such praise as they do receive tends to be conditional: “It’s the Bee Gees… but it’s really good.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/20/bee-gees-children-of-the-world-by-bob-stanley-review-very-high-and-mighty">Continue reading...</a>

<p>They are more likely to avoid alcohol than any other age group. Not easy, when you’re facing the nerves of starting university or navigating a new job</p><p>My first job out of university was on reception at some blue-chip company full of (probably) terrible suits, but that didn’t matter because the only person who ever spoke to me was the other receptionist, and she was great. She had this kid who was a rascal, and one day the police called to say he’d been nicked for some rascally behaviour. “To his credit,” they said, “he doesn’t have any previous convictions.” She replied: “Well, give him a chance – he’s only 13.”</p><p>Her voice popped into my head the other day when I was worrying about my daughter, and how non-alcohol-curious she is. Well, give her a chance – she’s only 13. But my nieces are the same way, and they’re older. My sister and I decided a while ago that this was our doing: they’d taken one look at us, or to be accurate, a million looks at us, and decided the Aperol bounce wasn’t for them. And while I’m almost immune to parental guilt, I did feel fantastically bad about the idea that I might, just by enjoying it too much, have put my kids off alcohol.</p><p>Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/20/my-generation-drank-to-quell-our-self-loathing-gen-z-is-admirably-tough-and-teetotal">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As a child, the actor Antonia Bernath feared for her safety every day. When she was 10, she and her mother escaped, but there was more tragedy to come. She describes how she put herself back together</p><p>‘There’s this idea of the middle-class utopia, and that child abuse can only exist alongside poverty,” says Antonia Bernath, an actor best known for her roles in Downton Abbey and St Trinian’s. Now 38, she has spent most of her adult life trying to process – and heal from – the years of violence she endured at the hands of her father during the 90s.</p><p>“It started very early,” she says. “My mum said that when I was a baby, he would use my cart as a balance for his gun while he’d shoot groundhogs.” Later, he would beat Bernath to the point where it was painful to sit down. Didn’t her teachers notice? “No,” she says, “no one questioned.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/20/how-we-survive-my-father-beat-starved-and-belittled-me">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Malcolm Macarthur was the wealthy, bookish socialite who shocked Ireland with a brutal double killing in 1982, and caused a major political scandal. I tracked him down and heard, for the first time, the tale he told about himself</p><p>Among Irish people old enough to remember the summer of 1982, Malcolm Macarthur is as close to a household name as it is possible for a murderer to be. He grew up in County Meath in the east of Ireland, on a grand estate with a housekeeper, a gardener and a governess. In his 20s, he received a large inheritance, and lived well on its bounty. But on the brink of middle age, he found he was going broke. At the time, the IRA was conducting a campaign of bank heists to fund their struggle. Macarthur was a clever and capable man, he reasoned, and so why should he not be able to pull off something along those lines?</p><p>He had been living for some months with a woman named Brenda Little and their son in Tenerife. He told Little that he had financial affairs to attend to, and flew to Dublin. But he did not bring off the heist; in the effort to attain a gun and a getaway car, he murdered two complete strangers. His first victim was a nurse, Bridie Gargan, whom he beat to death with a hammer in the process of stealing her car. His second was a farmer, Donal Dunne, who had agreed to sell him a shotgun. Macarthur shot him in the face and left his body in a bog. Both victims were 27 years old.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/20/ireland-most-notorious-murderer-malcolm-macarthur-why-i-might-have-done-what-i-did">Continue reading...</a>
