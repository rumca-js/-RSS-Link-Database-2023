It stands as an awkward rear extension, squeezed into an unloved armpit where the sticky chaos of Leicester Square spills into Charing Cross Road, while visitors have always been shuffled through an apologetic side entrance, as if being invited in to collect the bins.<br /><br />The reason it is so unwelcoming is that when the gallery was built in 1896 after its first years in temporary premises, it faced directly on to a slum \u2013 \u201ca neighbourhood of crime and vice\u201d, as architectural historian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/apr/21/a-day-with-nikolaus-pevsner-1960\">Nikolaus Pevsner</a> put it \u2013 and the insalubrious streets of Soho beyond. This regal repository of painted noblemen couldn\u2019t be seen to be fronting on to such a seedy district, so the architect, <a href=\"https://victorianweb.org/art/architecture/christian/index.html\">Ewan Christian</a>, moved the entrance as far around the corner as he could, to face the more seemly setting of St Martin-in-the-Fields church. As a result, the building\u2019s front has always looked like its back, the palazzo-like facade of arched windows and roundels crucially missing a front door.</p><p>Almost 130 years later, three momentous bronze portals have burst through the Grade I-listed stone walls, as part of the most radical transformation in the institution\u2019s history. In the hands of <a href=\"https://jamiefobertarchitects.com/\">Jamie Fobert Architects </a>and heritage specialists <a href=\"https://www.purcelluk.com/\">Purcell</a>, new galleries have been opened up, learning spaces and restaurants added, and a public forecourt created, in a \u00a341.3m process of surgical slicing and stitching, giving the rambling warren a vital new lease of life.<br /><br />\u201cIt\u2019s the great building Londoners never knew they had,\u201d says Fobert, standing outside the gallery\u2019s new entrance. \u201cOur job was to open it up, tie its different eras together, and give it a new public face.\u201d As his work at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/27/tate-st-ives-a-stunning-new-gallery-bullied-into-hiding\">Tate St Ives</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/feb/02/kettles-yards-rebirth-a-magical-sequence-of-spaces-worth-the-14-year-wait\">Kettle\u2019s Yard</a> attests, he is well positioned to accomplish such a task, free of the usual architect\u2019s urge to stamp his own signature too boldly.<br /><br />Where once there was a triangular scrap of fenced-off grass on the street corner, now stretches an inviting public space, providing a moment of pause between the bustle of Trafalgar and Leicester Squares. A chunky granite bench (mercifully free of anti-skating studs and anti-homeless bars) sweeps around an existing statue, echoing the curve of the road and merging into a broad set of stairs, while the pavement slopes up behind, bringing level access to the front door in a way that doesn\u2019t feel like a separate \u201caccessible\u201d ramp. On a recent visit, one wheelchair user asked where the ramp was \u2013 only to find they had already glided up it, unawares. It\u2019s a simple move, but one that is worlds away from the former indignity of being sent down a side alley to a separate ramped service entrance.<br /><br />\u201cThe idea was to make the experience the same for everyone,\u201d says Fobert, \u201cand intervene in ways that are almost imperceptible.\u201d You probably won\u2019t realise that a hefty concrete platform was craned in to bridge over a sunken lightwell to the new entrance, as the granite paving flows across it seamlessly. More noticeable are the sharply sliced openings, where the architects have taken their scalpel to the base of three windows and slashed through the Portland stone plinth to expose the fresh interior of the rock, in striking contrast to its gnarled outer surface. It leaves the Victorian mouldings playfully truncated, echoing the staccato postmodern facade of Venturi Scott Brown\u2019s National Gallery Sainsbury Wing next door (currently undergoing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jun/19/the-sainsbury-wing-redesign-spare-us-the-art-world-good-taste\">its own less sensitive remodelling</a>.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/21/doors-tracey-emin-national-portrait-gallerys-41m-rebirth\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/21/doors-tracey-emin-national-portrait-gallerys-41m-rebirth", "date_published": "2023-06-20 23:01:46+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Tutoring not a long-term plan to help English pupils catch up, say teachers", "description": "<p>School leaders are considering dropping out of the government\u2019s post-pandemic scheme as it prepares to cut funding</p><p>Almost half of school leaders say the government\u2019s national tutoring programme (NTP), set up to help pupils in England catch up after Covid, is not cost-effective, according to a new survey.</p><p>Most senior leaders who took part in the poll (58%) said they did not regard tuition as a long-term solution to closing the attainment gap for disadvantaged pupils.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jun/21/tutoring-not-a-long-term-plan-to-help-english-pupils-catch-up-say-teachers\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jun/21/tutoring-not-a-long-term-plan-to-help-english-pupils-catch-up-say-teachers", "date_published": "2023-06-20 23:01:46+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Keir Starmer \u2018eyes dozens of new peers to aid Labour government\u2019", "description": "<p>Party reportedly looking to increase share in Lords, as Tory majority \u2018could make life difficult\u2019</p><p>Labour is reportedly devising plans to appoint dozens of peers to the House of Lords to prevent a Keir Starmer government being stymied by the upper chamber.</p><p>There are 174 Labour peers, making up 22% of the Lords, compared with 263 Conservatives and 183 unaligned crossbench peers.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/20/starmer-eyes-dozens-of-new-peers-to-secure-labour-agenda-in-house-of-lords\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/20/starmer-eyes-dozens-of-new-peers-to-secure-labour-agenda-in-house-of-lords", "date_published": "2023-06-20 22:55:45+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Dear England review \u2013 touching, funny retelling of Gareth Southgate\u2019s quiet revolution", "description": "<p><strong>National Theatre, London<br /></strong>It\u2019s a game of two halves, but Jason Graham\u2019s dramatisation of Southgate rescuing a languishing England team delivers tension and movement </p><p>James Graham\u2019s story of the beautiful game and the travails of the England squad has some beautiful moments.

A gentle sense of tradition encountering transition after the death of the sport\u2019s greatest patron, Queen Elizabeth II, last year.<br /><br />It was evident as the royal procession bumpily made its way down the straight before the first race, and the regal waves of the King Charles III were met with gentle \u2013 rather than rousing applause \u2013 although plenty did tip their hats. The racecards also carried a new royal cypher, bearing the double C for Charles and Camilla.</p><p>It was evident too as the crowds cheered the sport\u2019s most famous jockey, Frankie Dettori, at what will be his final Royal Ascot before he rides off into the sunset. The headline in Tuesday\u2019s Racing Post had proclaimed it to be the Land of Hope and Dettori. But this was one of those afternoons when the magician waves his wand but the rabbit refuses to leave the hat.<br /><br />Mostly, though, Royal Ascot\u2019s unique ecosystem remains as familiar and unaltered as it ever was. A few months ago the Jockey Club announced a relaxation of its dress code to get more people to go racing. But for a place that is a stickler for rules, this was one Ascot was happy to swerve.<br /><br />In the Royal Enclosure, in particular, the clothing restrictions would make a sergeant major wince. Women are told that their dresses and skirts should fall just above the knee or longer \u2013 while men are reminded of the need for a waistcoat and necktie, with patterns of a patriotic nature deemed acceptable. Those unsure of where the line is can visit a room by the entrance which is labelled \u201cdress code enquiries.\u201d<br /><br />Some will roll their eyes at this, as well as Ascot\u2019s proud boast that it remains the centrepiece of the British sporting social season. But it is certainly up there. And it would be churlish to deny that it offers a palate that a large-cross section of the British public rather enjoys: dressing up, drinking, royalty and a speculative punt.<br /><br />Taking it all in was Dave Harries, an 80-year-old recording engineer, who said he had been coming to Royal Ascot since the 1960s. \u201cIt\u2019s still the place to be,\u201d he insisted, as he showed off his new Panama hat. \u201cIt\u2019s about the tradition, the racing, and the fact you can talk to everyone.\u201d<br /><br />As Harries also noted, Charles is rumoured to be no turfite at heart. However for now, at least, he is making the effort. He has promised to be here all week. And before the penultimate race on the first day, he was down in the paddock to run his eye over his horse, Saga, and talk to his jockey, Dettori. He even looked to be giving a passable impression of enjoying himself. But there was to be no winning headline as Saga trudged home in fifth.<br /><br />Afterwards Dettori\u2019s face was etched in frustration, the bookies in delight. For decades, they have been wary of the \u201cFrankie factor\u201d, with multiple wins on the same card turning small stakes into damaging payouts. But there was no chance of that happening on the first day, despite the 52-year-old\u2019s best efforts.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/20/king-charles-royal-ascot-frankie-dettori-horse-racing\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/20/king-charles-royal-ascot-frankie-dettori-horse-racing", "date_published": "2023-06-20 19:09:18+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Sunshine, secret sets and Elton\u2019s sendoff: Glastonbury 2023 prepares to open gates", "description": "<p>Crowds head to what could be a relatively low-key edition of the UK\u2019s biggest festival following its long-awaited return and 50th anniversary last year</p><p>As Glastonbury-goers flock toward Worthy Farm, the UK\u2019s biggest festival is yet to give up a number of secrets about the weekend \u2013 from surprise performers to the outcome of the mercurial south-western weather.</p><p>Most pressing is the question of whether Friday night headliners Arctic Monkeys will be able to fulfil their booking.

Instead, store them in an opaque container out of direct sunlight and away from heat. \u201cYou don\u2019t want them too close to the oven,\u201d she adds, \u201cbut equally, if they are tucked away at the back of a cupboard, that\u2019s when you\u2019ll start to forget they exist.\u201d This strategy is also endorsed by Cynthia Shanmugalingam, chef/founder of <a href=\"https://rambutanlondon.com/\">Rambutan</a> in Borough Market, London, who keeps her \u201cembarrassingly huge spice collection\u201d in airtight containers in a cool, dark cupboard. Her top tip, though, is to buy whole spices and a decent small electric spice grinder: \u201cThe difference between toasting and grinding your spices fresh is huge.\u201d Plus, they\u2019ll keep longer (typically 12 months, as opposed to six for ground spices).

Ernaux\u2019s own home movies are as poignant and sweet and boring as anyone else\u2019s, and I was reminded of Gilbert Adair\u2019s dictum that home movies all look like the work of the same eccentric auteur, with the same fetish for clumsy closeups, laborious slow pans and interminable, pointlessly dull establishing shots of scenery or tourist landmarks.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/20/the-super-8-years-review-the-family-life-of-annie-ernaux\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/20/the-super-8-years-review-the-family-life-of-annie-ernaux", "date_published": "2023-06-20 10:00:30+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Chelsea confirm signing of forward Christopher Nkunku from RB Leipzig", "description": "<ul><li>Deal for France international has been in place for months</li><li>Nkunku the first signing since Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s arrival</li></ul><p>Chelsea have announced the signing of the forward Christopher Nkunku from RB Leipzig on a six-year contract.

I tracked him down and heard, for the first time, the tale he told about himself</p><p>Among Irish people old enough to remember the summer of 1982, Malcolm Macarthur is as close to a household name as it is possible for a murderer to be. He grew up in County Meath in the east of Ireland, on a grand estate with a housekeeper, a gardener and a governess. In his 20s, he received a large inheritance, and lived well on its bounty. But on the brink of middle age, he found he was going broke. At the time, the IRA was conducting a campaign of bank heists to fund their struggle. Macarthur was a clever and capable man, he reasoned, and so why should he not be able to pull off something along those lines?</p><p>He had been living for some months with a woman named Brenda Little and their son in Tenerife. He told Little that he had financial affairs to attend to, and flew to Dublin. But he did not bring off the heist; in the effort to attain a gun and a getaway car, he murdered two complete strangers. His first victim was a nurse, Bridie Gargan, whom he beat to death with a hammer in the process of stealing her car. His second was a farmer, Donal Dunne, who had agreed to sell him a shotgun. Macarthur shot him in the face and left his body in a bog.
