  <p id="GGsrur">Twitch is replacing its Mature Content toggle for livestreams with new “Content Classification Labels,” according to <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2023/06/20/introducing-content-classification-labels/">a blog post published Tuesday</a>. The new labels are more descriptive, meaning streamers can be more specific about what viewers might see.</p>
<p id="2hmZcb">Twitch says streamers can now mark if their stream features:</p>
<ul>
<li id="v8QBbl">Mature-rated games</li>
<li id="r6TCdp">Sexual themes</li>
<li id="1XOPY3">Drugs, intoxication, or excessive tobacco use</li>
<li id="dFqWkv">Violent and graphic depictions</li>
<li id="rwMQ0C">Significant profanity or vulgarity</li>
<li id="OtsRul">Gambling</li>
</ul>
<p id="ON3lnu">Any games you play with an Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) of Mature will automatically get the “Mature-rated game” label, and if you change to playing a non-M-rated game, the label will be removed. And any labels you have will be automatically applied to VODs.</p>

  <p id="b4WfZT">Gas stoves release worrying amounts of benzene, a chemical <a href="https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/benzene/basics/facts.asp">linked</a> to leukemia and other blood cell cancers, according to a new study from Stanford researchers. Benzene that gas-burning stoves release inside homes can reach concentrations even higher than what’s typical in secondhand smoke, according to the <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.2c09289">paper</a> published last week in the journal <em>Environmental Science &amp; Technology</em>.</p>
<p id="cSVfwQ">The study adds ammunition to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22360189/gas-stove-methane-leaks-electric-climate-change">efforts to phase gas connections out</a> of homes and buildings. There’s a growing body of evidence on the risks gas stoves pose to public health and the environment.

  <p id="zZNuN5">Google is adding some more features to its Chrome iOS browser to tempt iPhone users away from Safari. Chrome on iOS is getting built-in Google Lens support soon, which will allow Chrome users to search for anything they see using just their camera. Translations are also being improved, alongside better calendar entry support and a new mini Google Maps view.</p>
<p id="N2RokU">The Google Lens support will make searching for objects like plants and clothing a lot easier in Chrome. Currently, you have to use the separate Google app to get access to Lens, but Google is adding this same feature into Chrome in the coming months so you can use existing or new photos to search from the Lens icon in the Chrome address bar on iOS devices.</p>

<p id="xpD8Ov">There are three new features. A script generator that generates scripts “based on a brief description and key inputs like tone and length.” A teleprompter, which has no real AI component, but lets users adjust timing and font size.
