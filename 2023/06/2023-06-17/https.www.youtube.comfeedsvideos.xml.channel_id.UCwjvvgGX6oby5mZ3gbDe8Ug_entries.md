Not only does the current Indian government believe that the CCP is encroaching on Indiaâ€™s inherent territory, but even the opposition leader also believes so.
China and India are two countries with ancient civilizations. Both China and India have suffered from foreign aggression since modern times. China and India fought side by side during the Second Sino-Japanese War. The economies of China and India are complementary. China and India can develop friendly relations on the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty, mutual understanding and accommodation, and learning from each other's strengths.
However, the red genes of the CCP do not recognize the universal values of freedom, democracy, the rule of law, and human rights. They believe in coercion and struggle and sometimes lack rational thinking and logic.
