- Elon Musk believes working from home is "morally wrong" due to equity concerns.
- Remote work has been shown to benefit marginalized groups, such as Black employees, disabled workers, and women, by providing greater equity, work-life balance, and reduced stress.
- However, there are concerns about potential drawbacks, such as proximity bias and limited career advancement opportunities.
- Employers can address equity issues by offering flexible work schedules, implementing four-day workweeks, raising wages for on-site workers, and providing bonuses to compensate for lack of flexibility.
- Oversimplifying remote work as a moral issue fails to acknowledge the benefits experienced by those who have truly benefited from it.
