A few months ago </span>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/attention-passengers-not-for-signs">I
complained</a> that the text version of the MBTA train arrival
announcements include a not-needed-for-text "attention passengers"
which delayed the key information to the second screen.  I'm happy to
report that they've fixed it!

While the vocal announcement is still "Attention passengers, the next
Red Line train to Alewife is now arriving", the text version is the
simple "Alewife train is now arriving".  They've only fixed it for the
second of the two announcements, when the train is arriving instead of
when it's approaching, but it's still great!

(They actually changed this a few months ago, mid-April,
but at the time I was waiting to see if they would fix it for the
other one, and then forgot to write about it.)
