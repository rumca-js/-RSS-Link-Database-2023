  <p id="nVLxT5">It’s been a long time coming, but Netflix is finally ready to show off its upcoming adaptation of <em>One Piece</em> — we got the very first trailer at the streamer’s Tudum event today. The clip shows off around 90 seconds of the live-action pirate series, featuring the main cast — which includes Iñaki Godoy in the lead role — as well as giant sea monsters and a very stretchy arm.</p>
<p id="bFyDH3">Just as important: the eight-episode series now has a premiere date. It’ll start streaming on Netflix on August 31st.</p>
<p id="bdMkFv">Based on Eiichiro Oda’s long-running manga and anime, the live-action adaptation was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21114640/netflix-one-piece-live-action-series-reported">first announced back in 2020</a>. Since then, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/6/23156589/one-piece-netflix-behind-the-scenes-show">we’ve seen small teases</a>, but this trailer is our first proper glimpse at the show.

During its Tudum livestream, the company revealed that the series — called <em>Squid Game: The Challenge</em> — will hit the service in November. We also got the first teaser for the competition show, which doesn’t show much but does confirm that Red Light, Green Light will make an appearance.</p>
<p id="Ry5Y4W">The reality spinoff may be dangerous and not particularly in the spirit of the original <em>Squid Game </em>story, but it also feels somewhat inevitable given the now-franchise’s success.
