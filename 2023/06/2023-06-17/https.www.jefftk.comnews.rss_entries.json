[{"source": "https://www.jefftk.com/news.rss", "title": "Alewife Train is Now Arriving", "description": "<p><span>\n\nA few months ago </span>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/attention-passengers-not-for-signs\">I\ncomplained</a> that the text version of the MBTA train arrival\nannouncements include a not-needed-for-text \"attention passengers\"\nwhich delayed the key information to the second screen.  I'm happy to\nreport that they've fixed it!\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/alewife-train-is-now-arriving-big.jpg\"><img alt=\"Alewife train is now arriving\" class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"147\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/alewife-train-is-now-arriving.jpg\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nWhile the vocal announcement is still \"Attention passengers, the next\nRed Line train to Alewife is now arriving\", the text version is the\nsimple \"Alewife train is now arriving\".  They've only fixed it for the\nsecond of the two announcements, when the train is arriving instead of\nwhen it's approaching, but it's still great!\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n(They actually changed this a few months ago, mid-April,\nbut at the time I was waiting to see if they would fix it for the\nother one, and then forgot to write about it.)\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid02DLpfuW4LrU5xP2NWcdyuWx4EhZvpmp3inqFTqZaq7a6JDtd6NK6bvkKX1vWT1a8Al\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://lesswrong.com/posts/ornkQKxabAxCmbmXP\">lesswrong</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@jefftk/110559758204875428\">mastodon</a></i></p>", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/alewife-train-is-now-arriving", "date_published": "2023-06-17 08:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
