Here are four thousand words about an intimate moment between Dr. Jill Biden Ph.D. and her husband Joe. It is not the first time we've seen Jill treat her husband Joe like a child. Those instances have been in the public eye where they don't understand the words \"<a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-jill-speech\" target=\"_blank\">hot mic</a>\" or \"<a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-jill-easter-bunny\" target=\"_blank\">the camera's rolling</a>.\" Here, the two were not aware of an Associated Press reporter catching them in the middle of what appears to be an argument.</p><p>The photos were collected by Twitter user Jake Schneider, who I'm guessing works for a small boutique firm in Minnesota called RNC Research.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">A story in four parts: <a href=\"https://t.co/Xdd1OfJQCT\">pic.twitter.com/Xdd1OfJQCT</a><br />\u2014 Jake Schneider (@jacobkschneider) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jacobkschneider/status/1544741511086194688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 6, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>One of them looks very familiar.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"803fd\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=30080604&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>There it is.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"e064a\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=30080605&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>Let's peruse each photo that this person shared on the public app called Twitter. They set a narrative.</p><p>Photo #1: We see what appears to be an angry Joe Biden holding a newspaper. He could be angry at his latest poll numbers. Or, maybe, he was angry at Jill for asking him if he remembered to use the bathroom before he left for a speech in Cleveland.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"a5fa1\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=34137832&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>Photo #2: It appears it's Jill's turn to speak. \"Don't give me that 'I don't have to go'. We tell you to go before you leave all the time. Plus, we can smell... did you just go now?\"</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image image-crop-custom\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"f4aa2\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=34137833&amp;width=586&amp;height=403&amp;coordinates=0%2C22%2C14%2C0\" />\n</p><p>Photo #3: He did.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"e7522\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=34137834&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>Photo #4: Jill walks away in frustration because Joe is Karine Jean-Pierre's problem to clean up.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"d6154\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=34137835&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>But this is just speculation on my part. <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/hunter-biden-movies-dad\" target=\"_blank\">Maybe Hunter sent Jill one of his \"special\" videos</a>. Joe could have asked for help with the crossword puzzles, and Jill said she was busy. Maybe Joe was upset Jill forgot to make him a reservation at Michael Symon's restaurant while he was in The Land, and Jill had to remind him she's a doctor and not a secretary. It's anyone's guess.</p><p>Let us know in either the Facebook comments or Twitter responses.

That's right. All the drama and the Dodgers wound up sneaking the bigoted queens onto the field when no one was looking. All while thousands of normie-Americans exercised their patriotic dissent outside.</p><p>I think we can call this a win. Or kinda a win.</p><p>To recap, the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence (who you may remember from such blog posts as this 2019 classic, \"<a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/another-child-sex-offender-discovered-at-drag-queen-story-time\" target=\"_self\" title=\"view post: ANOTHER Child Sex Offender Discovered at 'Drag Queen Story Time'\">ANOTHER Child Sex Offender Discovered at 'Drag Queen Story Time'</a>\") are an anti-Catholic troupe of queens who dress up as nuns and mock the crucifixion of Christ. The Dodgers had uninvited them from Pride Night when it was brought to the team's attention that this is considered offensive to millions of people. </p><p><span></span>It needs to be said, no one complained about the Dodgers having a Pride night. It was just this one group of blasphemous queens. The elusive \"common ground\" we are told we need to find would have been to find honorees who aren't full of hatred towards a specific group of Americans. But after the \"Sisters\" were uninvited, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/los-angeles-dodgers-sisters-indulgence\">leftist politicians got involved</a>. The team was forced to bend the knee and invited them back with a full-throated apology. LGBTQ activist bullies demand you support their every kink, or else.</p><p>Los Angeles Catholics chose \"or else.\"</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cBREAKING: Thousands of Catholics have shut down the main entrance to Dodger Stadium on Vin Scully avenue in protest of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence being honored tonight. \\n\\nThey are now lining the sidewalks and have taken over the entire block:\\u201d</div> \u2014 Savanah Hernandez (@Savanah Hernandez)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sav_says_/status/1669864763348881409\">1686961758</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Dodgers, I guess as a compromise OR to make sure the queens weren't booed out of LA, gave them their award to an empty stadium. This was over an hour before the first pitch was thrown. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cDODGER STADIUM-The \\u201cSisters of Perpetual Indulgence\\u201d are recognized for Pride night to a mostly empty audience.  \\n\\nTwo Dodgers fan nearby begin loudly booing after they\\u2019re announced:\\u201d</div> \u2014 Savanah Hernandez (@Savanah Hernandez)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sav_says_/status/1669877241642385408\">1686964733</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Reporter Savanah Hernandez says that the Dodgers were still honoring various Ls, Gs, Ts, Is, +s, and whatnot between every inning. Yet the blasphemous drag queens -- this one troupe that was so crucial in showing Pride because you're a homophobe if you don't affirm every kink and every glory hole in June -- got snuck out on the field before most people showed up.</p><p>This is why I call this \"kinda\" a win. A win would have been if the Dodgers organization stood its ground against Pride bullies and kept the Sisters uninvited. But the fact that being invited was rendered so toxic the only way for the Dodgers to check the box was to honor them before anyone showed up for the ballgame is at least half a win. Maybe two-thirds of a win. It's a win-ish.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.
