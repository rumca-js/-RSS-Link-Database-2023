<ul><li>Hülkenberg second, Alonso third; Pérez and Leclerc miss Q3</li><li>Hamilton and Russell fourth and fifth for Mercedes</li></ul><p>Max Verstappen took pole for the Canadian Grand Prix, delivering another dominant run in difficult, changeable conditions for Red Bull. With rain very much playing its part he beat the Haas of Nico Hülkenberg into second and the Aston Martin of Fernando Alonso into third. Lewis Hamilton and George Russell were in fourth and fifth for Mercedes. Alpine’s Esteban Ocon was sixth and McLaren’s Lando Norris in seventh.</p><p>Verstappen once more had the best pace in a qualifying session that had opened shortly after rain had hit the circuit and then returned again as the session progressed. Whether he might have been challenged remains moot as the final running was scuppered by the conditions but on every lap he put in, the world champion still looked to enjoy a comfortable advantage over the rest of the field.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/17/dominant-max-verstappen-claims-canadian-f1-gp-pole">Continue reading...</a>

And Nigella? Well, she loves Australia, and has long been a frequent visitor. She has previously said she feels “<a href="https://www.delicious.com.au/food-files/news-articles/article/nigella-lawsons-favourite-restaurants-australia/k1w71z5q">gorgeously at home</a>” here and dreams of spending three months a year down under. (She has been here since the beginning of May, so perhaps she’s making the dream a reality.)</p><p>As you’d expect, while she’s in Sydney, Nigella’s eating schedule is studded with the city’s greatest hits – Sean’s Bondi, Fratelli Paradiso, Bourke Street Bakery – as well as buzzy favourites such as Porkfat, Cafe Paci and Ragazzi. It’s inner city-heavy, yes, but that’s hardly surprising for a culinary celebrity staying in Potts Point.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/18/i-spent-the-day-eating-like-nigella-lawson-and-lived-to-tell-the-tale">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Beauty and pain coexisted for Tajette O’Halloran when she came of age in northern NSW. As an adult she is recreating scenes from her adolescence</p><p>I grew up in the northern rivers of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/new-south-wales">New South Wales</a> in the 1990s. It was a place of stark contrasts: utopian dreams, alternative culturex and abject social disadvantage. Since that time I have spent many years reflecting on my coming of age in such an unusual place and how it has shaped my adult life.</p><p>In 2014 I started taking pictures. Having witnessed up close the devastating ramifications of addiction, poverty and discrimination, I recognised that I had been carrying the weight of these burdens through my life<em>.</em> Fuelled by nostalgia and longing I was compelled to return to my home town over and over, using photography to rebuild my history from the perspective of an adult and a mother. The unprocessed grief of my youth was setting the foundation for my photographic practice.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/17/tajette-o-halloran-photographer-who-returns-to-her-teenage-years">Continue reading...</a>

## Wham! review – Netflix study of 80s pop legends is entertaining but weirdly incurious

<p>Documentary about George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley’s meteoric rise is a fun and moving watch that misses the chance to delve deeper</p><p>”Wise guys realise / There’s danger in emotional ties …” Here was one of the most artlessly, chillingly brilliant pop lyrics of the 80s, from Wham!’s Young Guns (Go For It), something to compare with the triumph of Madonna being a material girl in a material world. You can’t help thinking again about its relevance to Andrew Ridgeley and George Michael’s emotional ties to each other as you watch this entertaining but weirdly incurious documentary, composed of existing footage and voiceover commentary, apparently salvaged from earlier unidentified programmes.</p><p>Wham! was a pop band which lasted for four years, from 1982 to 1986, a meteoric fame ride which saw them devastate the music scene like Roy Lichtenstein’s fighter plane, clocking up a string of hits and getting canonised as pop A-listers alongside David Bowie, Bono, Elton John and Paul McCartney at the 1985 Live Aid concert; two grinning guys, still palpably overwhelmed with astonishment at their own success. They’d been inseparable friends since they were 11 at school in Bushey, Hertfordshire and still only in their early 20s when the band split up. (They also worked with, at different times, backing singers Dee C Lee, Helen “Pepsi” DeMacque and Shirlie Holliman, whose own opinions and inner lives are, sadly, of zero interest to this film.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/17/wham-review-netflix-george-michael-andrew-ridgeley-80s-pop">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Squabbling about which superclub gets to further enrich the Paris superstar is wearisome but he could do so much better</p><p>Europe, several years from now. A thin light strains through the cracked and grimy window. The air is gritty with smoke. The man wakes. He is stiff, cold, tired, afraid. Outside is devastation, the city in ruins. Everyone has fled. Even the sirens sound more distant now. With a trembling hand, the man withdraws his phone from his pocket. He must be sparing with the battery, he knows, but awkwardly he turns it on.</p><p>Perhaps this morning there will be signal. Perhaps this morning he will find out how far the crisis extends. The screen flickers. He hears the low ping before he sees the bars. A miracle. He has connection. There is a news alert. His fingers tremble as he taps. For a moment his weary eye can not quite take in the headline he sees. But then it shudders into focus: “Mbappé,” it says, “threatens to quit PSG.” Some things, at least, never change.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jun/17/kylian-mbappe-is-a-victim-of-the-psg-honeypot-and-his-talents-are-being-wasted">Continue reading...</a>

## Calling Bridget Phillipson ‘chippy’ is a cheap shot oozing in class contempt | Bidisha Mamata

A plan by private school cronies to wind up the shadow education minister is worthy of any posh movie villain<p>Chippy – it’s such a clever insult, isn’t it? If someone calls you chippy and you reel back and shout “I’m NOT chippy”, you sound sooooo… chippy. It’s a tactic worthy of any posh, smirking movie villain – or perhaps the officials representing Britain’s independent schools. Some of their private emails have been leaked, sniping about shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson, who’s part of Labour’s plan to add VAT to school fees. Apparently, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/15/private-school-officials-called-labour-minister-chippy-in-private-messages" title="">Phillipson “gets chippy”</a> with people challenging her, “so it is very easy to make her sound unreasonable by keeping your cool”.</p><p>Class contempt, back-door slander among cronies, sneering at a powerful woman, a smirking plan to manipulate and humiliate her, it’s all there. These officials are drawing a line: she is not like us, she doesn’t get it, she’s not in the club, she’s a proletarian hothead who can’t keep her cool – so that’s how we’ll wind her up.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/17/calling-bridget-phillipson-chippy-is-a-cheap-shot-oozing-in-class-contempt">Continue reading...</a>

If he sincerely believes in integrity in public life, the prime minister must unambiguously endorse the privileges committee’s damning verdict on his predecessor<p>Let’s conduct a dark thought experiment by imagining that Boris Johnson had successfully blagged and bullied the privileges committee into letting him get away with the repeated lies he told about Partygate. Our democracy would be in a very sickly condition this weekend. The Commons would be in disrepute with the public, a thumping majority of whom concluded long ago that the deceitful scoundrel <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/04/21/eight-10-britons-say-boris-johnson-lied-about-lock" title="">lied about law-breaking</a> in Downing Street. We would be looking at terrible damage to parliamentary scrutiny of the executive, which vitally depends on upholding the principle that MPs can expect ministers to give them honest information. If such a manifest deceiver had been let off the hook, it would not have taken long for lying to become institutionalised in parliament. So the excoriating judgment of the privileges committee was not just right, it was also imperative.</p><p>He greeted their findings with another of his toddler tantrums, screaming about “the final knife-thrust” and “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/jun/15/boris-johnson-partygate-privileges-committee-report-conservatives-uk-politics-live?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with:block-648acab88f087e69df9c5a5a" title="">a dreadful day for MPs and for democracy</a>”. To the contrary, this has been one of the brighter moments in the recent history of our democracy. In politics, the media and many other parts of the public square, we are in the midst of a titanic struggle. On the one side are bad actors who seek to advance themselves and their causes by peddling misinformation, mendacity and fakery. Resisting them are those who prize facts, veracity and rules. It was critical that the defenders of integrity in public life prevailed over the forces of darkness.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/17/johnson-has-been-utterly-disgraced-so-why-does-mr-sunak-flinch-from-condemning-him">Continue reading...</a>

## From Cornish pasties to Slovenian potica, food is a language that everyone understands

<p>What we eat defines us as a nation but it also crosses borders and, like Esperanto, helps us communicate globally</p><p>Food is an international language: an Esperanto that we all speak pretty fluently, for in the end everyone has to eat. But dialect words are also involved, and sometimes these are a little harder to translate. Last month, in Slovenia, where I was running a writing workshop, I found myself having to explain not only the meaning of the word pasty, but also the various reasons why the appearance of such a thing in a story might be an indicator of social class or even of character. “The author could have had Keith eat a sandwich,” I said, sounding more confident than I felt. “But he went for a pasty instead because he wants to reveal Keith’s masculine needs to the reader. Basically, Keith is the kind of man who feels himself to be woefully deprived unless he has a hot lunch.” (I know. Eat your heart out, FR Leavis.)</p><p>All cultures have portable dishes: in this sense, the pasty comes with an in-built universality, one my students grasped immediately (or at least they did once Google provided us with a picture). Then again, made properly, the Cornish pasty is also highly specific. Its recipe, as we know, is not to be messed with, and here’s where things got trickier. Keith, the bloke in the book we were talking about, is an old-school, pedantic type, which may be another reason why his usual lunch appeals to him; he gets to pass judgment on it as well as eat it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/17/from-cornish-pasties-to-slovenian-potica-food-is-a-language-that-everyone-understands">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The poet and debut novelist on inheriting her mother’s ferocity, gun violence in the US, and her determination to help her husband, Salman Rushdie, recover after he was stabbed on stage last year</p><p>Rachel Eliza Griffiths arrives at the <em>Observer</em>’s offices and I tell her at once, as I greet her, that I recognise her from the striking publicity photo at the back of the proof copy of her debut novel <em>Promise</em> – our reason for meeting. Lady Rushdie, known as Eliza, is Salman Rushdie’s fifth wife and is understandably mindful of the risk that she might find herself defined by her marriage or that her own achievements might get sidelined – Rushdie is, after all, a literary celebrity on a scale against which most first-time novelists would not wish to compete. But even before meeting her, the intensity, fluency and scope of her novel and of her award-winning collection of poetry <em>Seeing the Body</em> – illustrated by her own photographs – hints at a formidable independence.</p><p>And it is <em>she </em>who looks like the celebrity. At 44, she has standout glamour and if she feels jet-lagged after her recent flight from New York to London (where Rushdie has had a date at Windsor Castle – he was made a companion of honour by Princess Anne), she shows no sign of it. Her cream suit is so immaculately tailored, it is tempting to talk clothes with her. I know she is interested because of one of her poems, which refers to Calvin Klein and in which she describes attending Maya Angelou’s funeral and her hilarious attempts to disguise, during the service, the busting of her zip on a “good black dress with its snakeskin panel down the front”. But such frivolity is not on our agenda.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/17/writer-rachel-eliza-griffiths-promise-novel-salman-rushdie-attack">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The UK’s £9bn road project to relieve congestion on the M25 at Dartford is dividing communities and businesses <br /></p><p>‘They say it will ease traffic, but I can’t see it myself,” said Lyn Loines about Britain’s biggest road-building project, connecting north Kent with Essex via a huge, six-lane, 2.6-mile tunnel under the Thames.</p><p>Construction of the £9bn Lower Thames Crossing (LTC) will be on the doorstep of Loines’s house near Gravesend, blocking a view of green belt land that takes in lines of trees and rolling fields of bright yellow rapeseed.

Standing in front of a magnificent fabric mural, themed around his 2022 album <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/17/kurt-vile-watch-my-moves-review">(watch my moves)</a></em>, the guitarist’s long, wavy hair hangs in curtains around his face as his eyes cast intently downwards at a succession of instruments. In a plaid shirt and worn jeans, he is both a cartoon of every distrait American guitar player from Neil Young on down through the slacker era – and yet somehow still singular in his rumpled but unruffled air. His moves, meanwhile, are crab-like; his shakes of the head, staccato.</p><p>Likewise, Vile’s sprawling music tilts at a panoply of greats. There’s Young, of course, and Tom Petty and Bob Dylan, plus indie rock forerunners such as Dinosaur Jr’s J Mascis. But his songs remain instantly spottable in a lineup of drawled psych-rock – beautiful and tuneful, as well as gnarly and inward-folding.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/17/kurt-vile-and-the-violators-review-solid-gold-stoner-rock">Continue reading...</a>

Whistleblower who leaked the Pentagon Papers showing that the American public had been misled about the Vietnam war<p>Daniel Ellsberg, who has died aged 92, was the most important whistleblower of our times. His 1971 leaking of what became known as the Pentagon Papers showed conclusively that virtually everything the American public had been told by its leaders about the Vietnam war, from its origins to its current conduct, was false.</p><p>The leak itself did not end the war, and Ellsberg regretted not having come forward years earlier. He spent the rest of his life as a peace activist, encouraging others on the inside to reveal government malfeasance, and supporting those who did, including the 2003 GCHQ whistleblower <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/22/katharine-gun-whistleblower-iraq-official-secrets-film-keira-knightley" title="">Katharine Gun</a>.

Many politicians would be getting dewy-eyed. But not the shadow health secretary. “This wasn’t a nice place to live,” he says firmly. “I spent most of my childhood thinking I want to escape.” He disliked living in council property and wished his mother had more money and could afford the lifestyle his friend Luke enjoyed; he was embarrassed by his relative poverty.</p><p>It looks pretty nice to me, I say: clean, flowers budding in attractive planters, blissfully quiet. “I must say, Tower Hamlets have done a really good job of making it a better place than it was when I was growing up.” We head up to the actual flat, number 22, that Streeting and his mother lived in, and ring the bell. No answer. So we try the neighbour. A friendly man called Rahman answers. He says next door is now rented out. The door of number 22 bursts open and a young woman whooshes past, explaining that she’d not been hiding from us, she’s just in a rush. Streeting tells Rahman he’s a Labour MP in a neighbouring area. Rahman doesn’t recognise him, but wishes him good luck. He’s a Labour supporter.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/17/wes-streeting-prime-ministers-have-huge-power-so-why-would-you-not-want-to-do-that-job">Continue reading...</a>

<p>What started as an ache in my arms got so bad I had to stop driving and could barely work. Three years on, I am one of 3 million people in the UK living with pain that never goes away</p><p>Pain is like a memory, a path reinforced every time we walk down it. As such, it’s quite possible that writing this is an act of self-harm. It’s not just that it hurts to write, although it does; it’s that when I started thinking about this piece, reading around it, even jotting down notes, I felt the pain in my forearms flare up again, and for a month or two I considered calling it off. My physiotherapist would call that “avoidance”. I would call it “learning from experience”, given that it was writing that got me here in the first place.</p><p>It was late in the summer of 2020 when I started to develop an aching in my forearms: first the left, and a few days later, the right; a vague, untroubling pain, similar to the after-effects of a workout. I figured, like any reasonable person, that my arms were just tired. I had been typing late into the evenings finishing a book proposal, which, on top of everything else – household jobs, phone usage, the cliched pandemic sourdough baking habit – was taking its toll. (Honestly, have you ever considered just how much you use your hands?)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/17/my-wife-was-annoyed-i-couldnt-do-chores-or-hold-the-baby-even-the-doctors-were-fed-up-with-me-my-life-with-chronic-pain">Continue reading...</a>

But occasionally, for whatever reason, a person appears on the scene,” says Homann, who lives about a half-hour’s drive away in the suburb of Inala. “I passed this green house with skimpily dressed mannequins propped up outside – an unusual take on Christmas decorations. I knocked on the door to find out more. Ron answered.”</p><p>The pair chatted and developed an easy rapport, and an unlikely friendship was born. A few weeks later Homann returned, hoping to shoot inside Ron’s shed. “He has two old motorbikes, a go-kart, model airplanes, more mannequins and these crazy paintings he’s created up on the walls. We stepped into his kitchen and he mentioned something about having a couple of kilts in his cupboard. He had grandparents from Scotland and Ireland, and is very proud of his heritage, so he pulled out his Irish one.

<p>Mia Hansen-Løve’s bittersweet 2022 release, starring Léa Seydoux as a woman coping with the failing mind of her father, joins a select group of films exploring this most tender of ​life ​role reversals, from The Savages to Eat Drink Man Woman</p><p>French director <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/16/mia-hansen-love-one-fine-morning-the-most-cathartic-thing-was-turning-a-difficult-dark-reality-into-something-fun">Mia Hansen-Løve</a> has a knack for making unimpeachably delicate films about emotionally clobbering rites of passage. She has navigated death, divorce and traumatic adolescence with a softness that never quite turns to mush. Her most recent film, <strong>One Fine Morning</strong> – <a href="https://mubi.com/films/one-fine-morning-2022">now available to stream on Mubi</a> – takes the same approach to that strangest and most tender of life reversals, when children become their parents’ carers. Following a Parisian single mother (a never-better Léa Seydoux) as she reckons with the complications of steering her elderly, partially sighted father through the national care home system, from grappling with his dementia to redistributing his book collection, it’s quietly devastating, with pockets of warm humour and optimism.</p><p>Hansen-Løve has tackled the poignancy of parenting one’s parents before, with the passive-aggressive duet between Isabelle Huppert and the late <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/26/eyes-without-a-face-edith-scob">Édith Scob</a> among the highlights of her lovely 2016 film <strong><a href="https://mubi.com/films/things-to-come-2016">Things to Come</a></strong> (also on Mubi). Both films join a select canon of works on a subject audiences aren’t always eager to face. Some directors tackle it with overcompensating sentimentality, others with confrontational rawness. On the former end of the scale, look to sitcom creator Gary David Goldberg’s 1989 film-making debut <strong><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/dad">Dad</a></strong>, one of a slew of laughter-through-the-tears, parent-child dramas that Hollywood dreamed up in the wake of <em>Terms of Endearment</em>. Starring Ted Danson as a brisk businessman reconnecting with his father (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/jul/01/features.philipfrench">Jack Lemmon</a>) as the latter’s health deteriorates, it’s glibly, even mechanically melodramatic, but Lemmon’s increasingly vulnerable performance gets to you anyway.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/17/streaming-one-fine-morning-and-the-best-films-about-children-parenting-their-parents">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A spicy, summery cucumber and berry salad, spiced roast pork with cherry and chipotle salsa, and peaches roasted in wine and served with croissant wafers</p><p>There’s only one thing I love more than eating summer fruit, and that’s cooking with it. When it’s perfectly ripe, it brings so much to the table: colour, succulence, sweetness. Berries are perfect for being used just as they are, in all sorts of salads or in a salsa to pair with rich things such as creamy cheese or rich, red meat. Larger stone fruit such as peaches, meanwhile, often need a bit of help to show off their full glory, but that’s nothing a bit of roasting or grilling won’t tease out.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/17/summer-fruit-recipes-berry-salad-roast-pork-peaches-croissant-yotam-ottolenghi">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The emotional journey of three orphaned Muslim American siblings is evoked with heart-rending precision</p><p>Kausar is the youngest of the three orphaned sisters in Fatimah Asghar’s grief-soaked and gorgeous debut novel. When she walks past Bobby and his friends in the school cafeteria, she overhears him say: “<em>That’s my heart right there.</em>” With flushed cheeks, she races to the bathroom. She stares and stares into the mirror, but alas “can’t find another heart to give”. Adrift in the world without a mother or father, her heart is a little bit Noreen’s, a little bit Aisha’s. Her two sisters are all she has – even if the distance between them is growing. Kausar “put her heart inside [her sisters’] hearts” long ago, long before they became orphans. She was “born this way, belonging to them, trying to follow their breath”.</p><p>The day their father dies, murdered on the streets of America at the opening of the novel, their home turns into a “House of Sadness”. His body is sent from Pennsylvania to Lahore and buried in soil they can’t touch, in a “place he is from, and so we are from, but we know nothing about”. A VHS tape of his burial is sent to their house – the girls watch it on repeat surrounded by aunties.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/17/when-we-were-sisters-by-fatimah-asghar-review-a-poetic-tale-of-familial-grief">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The footballer and presenter escaped a tough start to become an England legend and one of the BBC’s faces of football. As the Women’s World Cup approaches she talks finding her voice – and why she’s no victim</p><p>As a child, Alex Scott gathered her Winnie-the-Pooh teddies on her bed. “Am I going to be all right?” she asked them. She loved her teddies, told them about her day, cuddled them for comfort. Eeyore had particular resonance. Something about the way the manufacturers had captured the character’s woe in his downcast expression allowed her to look at him and feel the true depth of his sadness. She imagined the story behind it. It helped somehow as she tried to block out the sound of her father’s tearing rage against her mother in the room next door. “Because I grew up in an environment where we didn’t show love. So, I got that feeling from my teddies.”</p><p>I lift my hand to interject with a question and Scott misunderstands this as an unwelcome gesture of sympathy. “No, it’s all right,” she says with a flick of panic. “I hate the idea of people ever feeling sorry for me. Because that’s the thing, I’m OK. I’ve done all right. I’ve come through things. I’m not a victim. I’m a survivor. So, like that thought you just had of, ‘That’s so cute,’ I’m like, ‘No, I’m all right. I’m good today.’” Actually, I was thinking of the way children create worlds to self-soothe, but I am struck by how on guard she is against pity. Alex Scott does not want pity.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/17/alex-scott-interview-womens-world-cup-hatred-because-i-wore-an-armband">Continue reading...</a>

Jerome is wonderful: he plays the role so sweetly – huge and bashful and vulnerable but powerful – and there’s a lot more going on than camera trickery, prop work and “He’s tall, look!”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/17/im-a-virgo-this-magical-tale-about-a-giant-teenager-is-joyously-bold">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Joseph McGill Jr tells a fascinating, necessary story of his direct engagement with truths many Americans would rather ignore</p><p>In Sleeping with the Ancestors, written with Herb Frazier, Joseph McGill Jr relates a fascinating, decades-long quest for truth. His work as a preservationist led to the formation of the <a href="https://slavedwellingproject.org/">Slave Dwelling Project</a>. All over America, McGill sleeps overnight in former slave quarters. In an informative and engrossing book, he now tells the story of this groundbreaking endeavor.</p><p>The idea came to McGill after a visit to Anne Frank’s hiding place in Amsterdam. Cramped quarters gave Anne, her family and friends temporary sanctuary from the Nazis. For McGill, “being there connected that space to her and her diaries that told of her life in hiding … That tour taught me the importance of preserving historic buildings.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/17/sleeping-with-the-ancestors-book-review-slavery-black-history">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Grand old Viennese coffee houses, blazing Algarve sunsets, steamboats in Stockholm, schnapps in Slovenia … and a dozen more reasons why we love Europe</p><p>At noon, <a href="https://www.stromma.com/en-se/stockholm/dining-cruises/brunch-cruises/brunch-with-ss-stockholm/" title="">steamboat S/S Stockholm</a> pushes away from Boulevard Strandvägen; its elegant art nouveau buildings, piped like cake icing, are the very definition of understated beauty. Our destination is Vaxholm, one of around 30,000 islands, skerries and islets in Stockholm’s archipelago. The city itself spans 14 islands, each with its own flair, like floating 3D puzzle pieces separated by waterways.<br /><br />As S/S Stockholm begins her journey, the lush island of Djurgården comes into view. The masts of my favourite museum, the <a href="https://www.vasamuseet.se/en" title="">Vasamuseet</a> – final resting place of a 17th-century warship – shoot high above the treeline. I hear gut-wrenching screams coming from amusement park <a href="https://www.gronalund.com/" title="">Gröna Lund</a> as we sail past. Thick forests, open parks and flower gardens are interlaced with biking routes and walking paths. Our proximity to nature and water organically creates work-life balance and slows me down to be fully present.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/jun/17/my-favourite-place-in-europe-17-travel-writers-on-the-country-that-feels-like-home">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Bagnèt verd is a thrifty and tasty alternative to pesto, made with parsley instead of basil and stale bread instead of nuts and cheese</p><p><em>Bagnèt verd</em> is a super-economical green sauce that originated in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/oct/28/land-of-plenty-harvest-in-piedmont-italy-wine-nutella">Piedmont</a>, northern Italy. It’s a kind of poor-man’s pesto made with stale bread instead of pine nuts and cheese. The firmer the bread, the better, but any crusty loaf will do. As a wholefood lover, however, I like to use the robust crust from a dark brown sourdough, because not only does it have plenty of flavour and nutrition, but it also gives the sauce a wonderful texture.</p><p>Bagnèt verd is usually served with grilled tomino cheese or <em>bollito misto</em>, a traditional dish of slow-cooked meat, but it also works brilliantly alongside any simply cooked meat, fish or vegetable. You can introduce a further layer of flavour complexity by the optional addition of a few capers and a couple of umami-rich anchovy fillets, but even if it’s kept entirely plant-based and without the optional extras, this is a hugely tasty sauce that you may well find yourself slathering on just about everything you can, from a humble piece of toast to a magnificent roast dinner.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/17/how-to-turn-stale-bread-into-poor-mans-pesto-zero-waste-cooking">Continue reading...</a>
