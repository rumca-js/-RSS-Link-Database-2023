19.8% of total VRM was severe

https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/advance-article/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad339/7188747?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email

Nationwide study,

incidence and outcomes of COVID-19 vaccination-related myocarditis (VRM).

44, 276, 704 individuals, at least 1 dose

Incidence and clinical courses of VRM cases

Diagnosis confirmed by Expert Adjudication Committee of the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency

COVID-19 VRM

1, 533 presumptive cases 

Confirmed in 480 cases

(1.08 cases per 100 000 persons)

Incidence was significantly higher in men

Men, 1.35 per 100 000 persons

Women, 0.82 per 100 000 persons

Males aged 12 to 17, 5.29 cases per 100 000 persons

Females over 70, 0.16 cases per 100 000 persons

COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for everyone ages 6 months and older in the United States for the prevention of COVID-19.

Mostly after first or second dose

mRNA vaccines compared to other vaccines

VRM after mRNA vaccines, 1.46 per 100 000 persons

VRM after AZ vaccine, 0.14 per 100 000 persons

P les than 0.001

Denmark, VRM

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34916207/

BNT162b2, 1.4 per 100 000 vaccinated individuals

mRNA-1273, 4.2 per 100 000

(within 28 days of vaccination) 

Severe VRM was identified in 95 cases

19.8% of total VRM 

(0.22 per 100 000 vaccinated persons)

85 intensive care unit admission

(17.7% of total VRM)

36 cases of fulminant myocarditis

7.5% of total VRM

21 cases required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation

(4.4% of total VRM)

21 more severe adverse events 

(4.4% of total VRM)

Eight out of 21 were sudden cardiac dea*** (SCD)

(attributable to VRM proved by an autopsy)

All cases of SCD attributable to VRM were aged under 45 years and received mRNA vaccines

1 heart transplantation

Conclusion

Moreover, SCD should be closely monitored as a potentially fat** complication of COVID-19 vaccination.

Most common presenting symptom

Chest pain or discomfort

Median time from the vaccination to symptom onset, 3 days 

(IQR, 1â€“10 days) 

COVID-19 VRM incidence was highest in mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna)

Followed by BNT162b2

J and J Ad26 0.20 per 100 000 persons

AZ ChAdOx1 0.14 per 100 000 persons
