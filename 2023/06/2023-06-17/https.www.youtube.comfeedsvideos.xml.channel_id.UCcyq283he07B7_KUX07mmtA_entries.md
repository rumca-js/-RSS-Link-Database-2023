One of the most expensive mattresses on the market is made from natural latex. It’s hypoallergenic, biodegradable, and more durable than memory foam. You can buy a memory-foam mattress for a few hundred dollars, but natural latex mattresses usually cost over $1,500 and can exceed $2,000. Latex sap from rubber trees is in high demand from dozens of industries, including car tires. This high demand has caused deforestation and displacement of farmers in places like Cambodia. Some mattress companies source their latex from organic and fair-trade-certified farms in places like Guatemala, but the latex from these farms comes at a premium compared to the latex from noncertified plantations. We explored why natural latex mattresses are so expensive.
