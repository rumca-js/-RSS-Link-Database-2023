Like some figure from myth whose face changes with angle and light. The first day of the Edgbaston Ashes Test was one mood, the bucolic English summery kind that justifies the work of pastoral poets.

Few sports make you think so much about light.

However, in contrast to the harsh, at times industrial soundscapes of 2013\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jun/16/sigur-ros-kveikur-review\">Kveikur</a></em>, their first album in a decade (and first since multi-instrumentalist <a href=\"https://kjartansveinsson.com/\">Kjartan Sveinsson</a> returned to the fold) largely eschews percussion.

Overall, though, there\u2019s a disappointing homogeneity, and the start of the album in particular feels so overegged as to be almost cloying. It turns out there\u2019s a limit to how much amorphous euphoria it\u2019s possible to take in one sitting. Perhaps part of the problem is the fact that much of it sounds like devotional music, with J\u00f3nsi\u2019s language-less vocals obscuring whom or what is being worshipped.
