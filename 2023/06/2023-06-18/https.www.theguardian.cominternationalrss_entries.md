## Australia cloud England’s mood after seeing their own tail washed away

<p>Rain cut the third day short but it was the heavy skies that brought it that put paid to the home side’s openers</p><p>You learn as you go that cricket in England has moods. Like some figure from myth whose face changes with angle and light. The first day of the Edgbaston Ashes Test was one mood, the bucolic English summery kind that justifies the work of pastoral poets. On the second, jaunty scoring gave way to a half-overcast grind under high cloud. The third, after England had bowled to a seven‑run lead, a sudden darker mood flashed at the home side in a window before rain.</p><p>Rain, cloud, darkness. Few sports make you think so much about light. All countries have sun, but there is a hard clear sunshine that only derives from an Australian summer, streams of photons hurtling on their long trip through space and smashing into cricket fields, bouncing back with such force that you’d swear you can hear them ping like stones off glass. Turn on a television anywhere in the world and see Australia’s summer, so bright it washes out the blue of sky and green of grass into variations of white.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jun/18/australia-cloud-englands-mood-after-seeing-their-own-tail-washed-away">Continue reading...</a>

## Sigur Rós: Átta review – too much amorphous euphoria

<p>(BMG)<br />With ambient strings and language-less vocals to the fore, the Icelandic art-rockers’ first album in a decade is in danger of washing right over you</p><p>Ever since they first appeared in the late 1990s, Iceland’s <a href="https://sigurros.com/">Sigur Rós</a> have occupied a fertile middle ground between post-rock and classical. However, in contrast to the harsh, at times industrial soundscapes of 2013’s <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jun/16/sigur-ros-kveikur-review">Kveikur</a></em>, their first album in a decade (and first since multi-instrumentalist <a href="https://kjartansveinsson.com/">Kjartan Sveinsson</a> returned to the fold) largely eschews percussion. Instead, the 10 tracks here, with strings from London Contemporary Orchestra very much foregrounded, tend towards slowly unfurling ambient washes of sound.</p><p>Listened to as individual songs, the effect is undeniably beautiful, notably the way Skel builds to its climax before gently subsiding, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/aug/18/jonsi-birgisson-the-sigur-ros-singer-on-his-bold-new-direction">Jónsi</a>’s vocals are especially affecting on the more subdued Ylur. Overall, though, there’s a disappointing homogeneity, and the start of the album in particular feels so overegged as to be almost cloying. It turns out there’s a limit to how much amorphous euphoria it’s possible to take in one sitting. Perhaps part of the problem is the fact that much of it sounds like devotional music, with Jónsi’s language-less vocals obscuring whom or what is being worshipped. Either way, <em>Átta</em> feels surprisingly unengaging.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/18/sigur-ros-atta-review-too-much-amorphous-euphoria">Continue reading...</a>

## The big picture: another side of old Istanbul

<p>No one knew the city better than the photojournalist Ara Güler, whose image of the boatyards of Karaköy reveals two distinct worlds</p><p>“I understand the smell of Istanbul,” the Turkish photographer Ara Güler used to say. And nowhere is the pungency of the city sharper than in his images of working boats on the Bosphorus. Having given up ambitions to be a film director, Güler devoted himself to making pictures in the 1950s as postwar democracy established greater press freedom. His first published story, on the city’s Armenian trawler boats, almost caused a riot at his newspaper office, when the fishermen turned up to protest about the fact that he had shown them swigging alcohol as they set out at dawn.</p><p>This picture was taken in the old caulking yards of Karaköy. The young man in the foreground invites you to imagine not only his life, but those of his colleagues beyond, at work or in conversation. “There is nothing without humans,” Güler said of his pictures. Though his image perfectly frames two distinct worlds, the skyline of mosques and minarets, and the waterside realities of shacks and barges and tyres, it is the people who count. “It was never about what venue I shot,” Güler said. “I shot pieces of life.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/18/the-big-picture-old-istanbul-ara-guler-play-light-shadow-foam-amsterdam">Continue reading...</a>
