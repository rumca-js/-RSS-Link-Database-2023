  <p id="yGMRxf">On Thursday, <em>Motherboard</em> <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3mm5x/amazon-delivery-drivers-walk-out-in-first-ever-driver-strike">reported</a> that Amazon delivery drivers in Palmdale, California <a href="https://teamster.org/2023/06/teamsters-at-amazon-walk-out-in-historic-unfair-labor-practice-strike/">have gone on strike</a>, a first for the company. The drivers, who <a href="https://teamster.org/2023/04/amazon-drivers-join-teamsters-union-reach-agreement-in-historic-victory/">unionized with the Teamsters</a> in April and were recognized by Amazon “Delivery Service Partner” (DSP) Battle-Tested Strategies in May, are demanding better pay and improved safety conditions. The 84 striking workers walked out on Thursday.</p>

  <p id="QenzHy">After Baylor microbiology professor and public health advocate Peter Hotez, MD Ph.D. <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterHotez/status/1670040001751445504?s=20">tweeted out</a> a <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7zz9z/spotify-rogan-rfk-vaccine-misinformation-policy"><em>Motherboard</em></a><em> </em>article about Spotify’s lack of moderation over Joe Rogan’s misinformation article, Rogan <a href="https://twitter.com/joerogan/status/1670196590928068609?s=20">challenged him</a> to debate Robert F Kennedy, Jr.  Rogan also proposed a $100,000 donation to a charity of Hotez’s choosing. </p>
<p id="ZuwOuZ">Twitter’s owner Elon Musk joined the fray, accusing Hotez of “hating charity” by not accepting the debate, and after hours of Elon and Rogan stans taunting Hotez, the professor <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterHotez/status/1670459060485869568">tweeted</a>, “I was just was stalked in front of my home by a couple of antivaxers taunting me to debate RFKJr.”</p>

## Microsoft says June Outlook outages were a DDoS attack

  <p id="N91KKP">In early June, complaints began cropping up on Twitter that Outlook was down for as many as 18,000 users at the peak of what, it turns out, was a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack, according to a story in <a href="https://apnews.com/article/microsoft-outage-ddos-attack-hackers-outlook-onedrive-7a23f92ab3cc2b7f0c590c7d08cf03fe"><em>The Associated Press</em></a> (<em>AP</em>) this morning. Microsoft acknowledged the attack in a <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2023/06/microsoft-response-to-layer-7-distributed-denial-of-service-ddos-attacks/">blog post</a> on Friday, offering some technical details and recommendations for guarding against such attacks in the future.</p>
<p id="PV4g3y">The blog doesn’t mention whether the company got things under control or whether the attack abated on its own. But on Twitter, the Microsoft 365 Status account <a href="https://twitter.com/MSFT365Status/status/1665734492122742790?s=20">tweeted about the outage</a> as it occurred on June 5th, then <a href="https://twitter.com/MSFT365Status/status/1665814515198435329?s=20">again later that day</a>, finally seeming to get things <a href="https://twitter.com/MSFT365Status/status/1666302553104191488?s=20">under control the next morning</a>:</p>

## Shutterless cameras deserve good shutter sounds

  <p class="p-large-text" id="dRPAvI">Snapping a camera’s shutter to take a picture is one of the best feelings in photography. You get a timeless, tactile feedback as you capture every decisive moment with <a href="https://youtu.be/7S8u6BXt7sM">a satisfying auditory “click” sound</a>. But we’re slowly losing this hallmark of picture-taking. Not only because smartphones are replacing full-size cameras for most people but because more cameras are being built without mechanical shutters at all.</p>
<p id="EdCvh1"><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23562434/nikon-z9-mirrorless-camera-test-review-video">Nikon’s flagship Z9</a> and newer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23716991/nikon-z8-mirrorless-camera-price-specs-hands-on">Z8</a> cameras forego traditional shutters entirely, so instead of hearing and feeling a mechanical action, you either hear nothing at all or are played the sound of a fake shutter. Just this week, Nikon released <a href="https://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/mirrorless-cameras/firmware-updates/z-9-firmware-4-point-0.page">firmware 4.0 for the Z9</a>, which added a slew of new features, including <a href="https://youtu.be/q6hUQZZHPWw?t=181">extra shutter sounds</a>:...</p>
