Each musician was looking to do something different, so they availed themselves of the downtime during the early part of the pandemic to write songs and put together a band.\n\nThat band \u2014 Maygen and the Birdwatcher \u2014 is the result. Their debut album, Moonshine, released in 2021, almost instantly earning the band accolades from the Midwest Country Music Awards for Album of the Year and Americana Artist of the Year).\n\nLast October, Maygen and the Birdwatcher released the follow-up album, Bootleggin\u2019 At The Flower Shoppe. The band visited The Current studio to play three songs for Radio Heartland.
