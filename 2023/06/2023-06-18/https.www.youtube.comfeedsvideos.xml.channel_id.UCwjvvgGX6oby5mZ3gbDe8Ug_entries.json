According to an official announcement, the explosions damaged at least 26 homes, resulting in three deaths and multiple injuries.\nChina's news has a trait. That is, what is officially hyped up isn\u2019t necessarily important, and what is officially low-key isn\u2019t necessarily trivial. The party media can make a simple matter so big that everyone knows about it or even engages in it, or they can make a really serious issue so low-key that people don\u2019t even notice it which is quickly forgotten. \n\nHave questions?
