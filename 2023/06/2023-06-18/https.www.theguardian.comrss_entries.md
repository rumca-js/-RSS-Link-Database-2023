<p>Croatia’s wait for victory, the coronation that has been so close so often, continues and will probably never come for this generation now, the best they have ever had. Spain’s own golden era, meanwhile, is unlikely be matched but they did at last raise a trophy to the sky – 11 years on.</p><p>Runners up at the World Cup in 2018, third in 2022, Zlatko Dalic’s side fell in the final of the Nations League, penalties their downfall this time. Four shootouts they had won, in the last 16 and the quarter-finals of each of those World Cups, but late on Sunday night Bruno Petkovic saw his spot kick saved by Unai Simón and Dani Carvajal scored to take this trophy back to Madrid.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/18/croatia-spain-nations-league-final-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

## We Love Glastonbury review – prepare to be jealous of anyone with a ticket

<p>From Jessie Ware enthusing about Jay-Z to Jake Shears welling up at his memory of the festival, there are loads of incredible highlights in this retrospective. Brace for goosebumps</p><p>If you’re going to the Glastonbury festival and you get there early, on the Wednesday or Thursday, there’s usually a smattering of entertainment dotted around the site that serves as a gentle warmup act for the main event. We Love Glastonbury is just that. It’s a preamble to the big weekend, whetting the appetites of both ticket-holders and telly-watchers with some of the most famous performances of the last couple of decades. It is interspersed with talking heads chatting about their favourite memories of the festival, whether they were there to see it or caught it from the comfort of their own living room via the BBC’s substantial and comprehensive annual coverage.</p><p>The programme is, it’s true, a bit slight, but there’s nothing wrong with that. It was always going to be impossible to condense more than 50 years of festivals into a single hour. This is mostly made up of the televised, BBC-affiliated last 25 years or so, although there is a brief clip of Oasis in 1994, when it would have been broadcast on Channel 4. The film also has to deal with the problem of other people’s memories of a really fantastic night out never being quite as interesting if you weren’t there with them. “The problem we’ve got is that there’s not much I can tell on camera,” says Self Esteem, sagely.</p><p>We Love Glastonbury aired on BBC Two and is available on BBC iPlayer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/18/we-love-glastonbury-review-prepare-to-be-jealous-of-anyone-with-a-ticket">Continue reading...</a>

<p>New technology raises hopes and ethical dilemmas.

<p>Nearly three decades after the founding of the Women’s prize, the fight for space in fiction has largely been won. It’s time to move on to politics, history, science, sport…</p><p>The award of the Women’s prize for fiction to the American writer Barbara Kingsolver last week is unusual in an awards industry that is always on the lookout for new departures: it is the first time in the prize’s 28-year history that any writer has won it twice. In other regards, however, the Women’s prize is diversifying, with plans to award a sister prize for nonfiction from next year.</p><p>To see the logic of this, it’s worth scrolling back. The plan for a fiction prize exclusively for women emerged out of a series of meetings between publishers, authors, agents, booksellers and journalists in the wake of the 1991 Booker shortlist, which featured no women at all. Angela Carter’s joyous final novel, <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/98/12/27/specials/carter-wise.html" title="">Wise Children</a>, was among those eligible, though sadly this giant of 20th-century literature died too early to benefit from the new award.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/18/the-guardian-view-on-nonfiction-by-women-so-much-buried-treasure">Continue reading...</a>

While I have learned, for my own peace of mind, not to attach significance to the timing of Dom’s death, the fact remains that following the “rules” meant I couldn’t offer Dom the opportunity to come home (and so I wasn’t able to provide the support that I’d previously always given to him when he most needed it).</p><p>Meet-ups were in London parks, to which I drove from my home town in Thame, Oxfordshire – not exactly straightforward, but doing the right thing is rarely easy. Of course, as a concerned parent, I wanted to swoop him up, but I also recognised the shared responsibility that we had to follow a set of rules designed to safeguard us all.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/18/boris-johnson-deceit-is-sickening-for-those-who-lost-loved-ones-during-covid">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In 1952 Robert Gambles became senior history teacher at the Merchant Taylors’ school, Crosby, in Liverpool, where he remained for 31 years. I was a pupil of RHG – the staff were usually referred to by their initials in those days – and was slightly in awe of him. He could let fly a stern rebuke if you touched a sore spot. But I am immensely grateful to Robert, who has died aged 99, as the teacher with responsibility for guiding and coaching many generations of boys towards Oxford and elsewhere.</p><p>Although not an eccentric History Boys-style teacher, he was a respected force in the school. As we later agreed, he knew he had failed to ignite in me an enthusiasm for history, but he helped me on my way to study English at Oxford.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jun/18/robert-gambles-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Fans in the Hollies Stand pig out on a damp Sunday but Darth Vader outstays his welcome at the first Test</p><p>It was a tough day for Moeen Ali, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/18/england-moeen-ali-australia-fined-first-test-ashes">fined 25% of his match fee</a> for using a drying agent on his hands and rubbing a hole in the skin on his forefinger caused by excessive contact with the Dukes ball’s pronounced seam. Spin bowling has always been a painful business – back in 1913 Surrey’s Razor Smith, nicknamed because of his unusually slight frame, noted that he always knew immediately on releasing the ball whether it would turn or go straight, because if it was a turner he would “get a sharp pain in my shoulder … many’s a time I have gone home feeling as if my right arm was coming off at the shoulder and almost wishing it would do so”.</p><p>But the finger has taken the brunt. Yorkshire’s Ted Wainwright, who played five Tests in the 1890s, suffered terribly from spinning-related cuts and lesions. “I used to hold the ball between the thumb and first finger, with the finger pressing along the seam,” he said. “The pressure upon the finger often made the skin break, and I was repeatedly troubled with soreness as a consequence; in fact, it was no uncommon thing for my finger to bleed.” Eventually he took to wearing a bandage on the first finger of his right hand which, he insisted, “far from assisting my bowling, handicapped it very considerably”. From the pavilion, though, the sight of his white finger set conspiracy theorists spinning, leading to him being dogged by rumours that he had commissioned a rubber finger stall to cover his finger, avoid injury and add bonus spin.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/18/ashes-diary-moeens-finger-and-wallet-bear-brunt-of-a-hard-days-spin">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When I started listening to BTS in 2019, I couldn’t have imagined their music would take me across the world – but being a member of Army has been a life-changing passion, writes Sophia Cai</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=cvau_sfl">Get our weekend culture and lifestyle email</a></li></ul><p>It’s 3am and I’m huddled in a collapsible camping chair outside Kia Forum in Los Angeles, wrapped in four layers of clothing and blankets. I’ve travelled halfway across the world to see Suga/Agust D perform in his first solo tour. Suga and Agust D are the same person, both being stage names adopted by Min Yoongi of the Korean boyband BTS. While Suga, one of the group’s rappers and producers, has performed in sold-out stadiums and arenas all around the world with his bandmates, this is the first time a member of the group has toured alone. He also happens to be one of my favourite members of BTS – so over six weeks, I will travel to three countries in two continents to see him perform a total of seven times.</p><p>To describe BTS simply as a K-pop boyband would be to miss the enormous cultural, artistic and social impact that the seven-member group continues to have. Not only have the members topped music charts around the world, their influence extends far beyond the sphere of pop music. From speaking engagements at the UN and the White House, being granted diplomatic passports from the South Korean government, to their fundraising and philanthropic efforts for a variety of causes, the “BTS effect” continues to change the world. Even though BTS is on hiatus from group activities until 2025 as the band members <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/15/bts-military-service-kpop-jin-kim-south-korea">undertake their mandatory military service in South Korea</a>, this month the city of Seoul will be transformed for celebrations to mark the band’s 10-year anniversary.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</a></strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/19/bts-suga-army-fangirl-kpop-concerts-fandom-south-korea">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Her career has taken in the good, the bad and the frankly unbelievable. Here are a few of my favourite memories</p><p>I am not entirely sure when Nadine Dorries entered my consciousness, but it was a long time before she – and this remains something that strongly resembles a fever dream – became a secretary of state. It might have been back in 2010, when she professed in a <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2010/09/nadine-dorries-palin-bagshawe">New Statesman interview</a> to “totally admire” Sarah Palin. Perhaps it was earlier, in 2008, when she referred on her blog to an anti-abortion conspiracy theory<strong>, </strong>speculating that 21-week-old foetuses could <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161209130748/http://www.badscience.net/2008/03/nadine-dorries-and-the-hand-of-hope/">punch their way out of the womb</a>.</p><p>Maybe it was when she was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160603182140/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/oct/21/nadine-dorries-mp-blog-70-fiction">criticised by the standards committee</a> after admitting that her blog, aimed at updating her constituents, was in fact “70% fiction” (her words), but then<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101030230720/http://blog.dorries.org/id-1723-2010_10_The_BBC_were_fair_and_balancedgulp.aspx"> later wrote</a> on the same blog that “everything on the blog is accurate”, which presumably was part of the 70%. Was it when she compared the Telegraph’s investigation into MPs’ expenses to coming close to a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/may/22/mps-expenses-conservatives">McCarthyite witch-hunt</a>?

<p>(Blue Note)<br />Spanning synthpop to electronic R&amp;B, the singer and bassist’s expansive Blue Note debut is a genre-hopping class act, with guests to match</p><p>Over the past 30 years, German-born American bassist and vocalist <a href="https://www.meshell.com/">Meshell Ndegeocello</a> has lent her unique blend of spacious melodies, rooted grooves and intricate fingerpicking to tracks by everyone from Madonna to Herbie Hancock and Robert Glasper. Across her own albums, Ndegeocello has been honing this sound to create soulful music that interpolates R&amp;B and hip-hop as much as the virtuosity of jazz. Most recently she produced 2018’s <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/16/meshell-ndegeocello-ventriloquism-review-timeless-lustrous-take-on-90s-rb">Ventriloquism</a></em>, which reinterpreted R&amp;B tracks from the 80s. On <a href="https://store.bluenote.com/products/meshell-ndegeocello-the-omnichord-real-book">her latest album</a> Ndegeocello now looks forward, producing a futuristic, original soundscape of jaunty synthpop and electronic R&amp;B.</p><p>Clattering electronic drum programming gives a modernist swing to tracks such as Georgia Ave and Omnipuss, while Josh Johnson’s synthesised saxophone underpins the keening harmonies of An Invitation. Features from vibraphonist Joel Ross on the balladic Towers and guitarist Jeff Parker on the fast-paced fusion of ASR are meanwhile anchored by Ndegeocello’s punchy bass playing, giving consistency to her genre-hopping palette. At 18 tracks long, certain numbers, such as the guitar-strumming Call the Tune or the ambient Oneelevensixteen, are tantalisingly brief and sketch-like. As a whole, it’s a confident imagining of her infectious future funk sound.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/18/meshell-ndegeocello-the-omnichord-real-book-review-infectious-futurist-jazz">Continue reading...</a>

## Why no choice is a good choice: the return of the tasting menu

<p>Tasting menus got a bad name when they became too serious and expensive. Now they’re shorter, cheaper, more inviting – and could help restaurants through tougher times</p><p>Few things divide opinion in the restaurant world like the tasting menu. Over the past 20 years, this extended format has both accumulated cachet as a signifier of culinary ambition and attracted relentless dyspeptic criticism.</p><p>In 2012, the <em>New York Times</em>’s restaurant critic, Pete Wells, was feeling “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/10/dining/tasting-menus-can-be-too-much-of-a-good-thing.html" title="">trapped, helpless</a>” in the face of “marathon” meals.

## Conspiracy theories are festering in Britain – and our politicians are making it worse | John Harris

<p>Of course people blame a ‘distant elite’ when politicians are often distant and elitist. But MPs must tackle misinformation</p><p>Over the past five years or so, one aspect of talking to the public about politics has become more and more pronounced. In the wake of some story or other, I will be dispatched to divine people’s views about it. For a while, the conversations will largely be pretty straightforward, touching on politics and power, people’s lives and the relationship – or lack of it – between them. And then, without warning, somebody will tip the conversation into altogether more exotic territory, centred on a conspiracy theory.</p><p>Not long after the death of Queen Elizabeth II, I was in the South Yorkshire village of Grimethorpe, listening to a somewhat earnest young man’s views about how the deceased monarch had been fond of drinking babies’ blood. On a visit to Birmingham in 2022, I listened to two loquacious pensioners talking about how Covid-19 was a fiction invented by the world’s rulers, and global death figures had largely been made up – opinions that blurred into a general sense that a lot of people still did not believe a word of what they had been told about the pandemic. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2021/may/11/hands-face-and-empty-space-where-covid-has-left-politics-video">The previous year</a>, in fact, I had reported from parts of the city where community organisations were trying to get people to be vaccinated, in the face of large-scale public scepticism and hostility.</p><p>John Harris is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/18/conspiracy-theories-britain-politicians">Continue reading...</a>

## Christine and the Queens review – phantasmagoric drama and musical transcendence

<p><strong>Royal Festival Hall, London</strong><br />A two-hour rock opera version of their new album – which is in turn inspired by Tony Kushner’s Aids drama Angels in America – the band’s feverish Meltdown performance was overwhelming</p><p>“This is going to get more dramatic than I anticipated,” Chris proclaims after his drummer showers him with roses midway through the show. But it’s hard to tell how much of the dialogue between songs is scripted in this two-hour rock opera dramatising Christine and the Queens’ latest album, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/09/christine-and-the-queens-paranoia-angels-true-love-review">Paranoïa, Angels, True Love</a>. Sometimes it’s filled with monologues about pride, or St Michael’s sword, at others tongue-in-cheek jabs at the audience for getting up to pee during the “ritual”.</p><p>That’s how Chris describes his headline show at Meltdown festival multiple times: a ritual. Much like the angels in Tony Kushner’s 1991 magnum opus <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/apr/14/angels-in-america-tony-kushner-national-theatre">Angels in America</a>, on which the album is based, music is presented as a disruptive force – one with the power to terrify and transform. The play follows Prior Walter, a young man dying with Aids in late-80s New York as he’s visited by angels in a series of visions and prophetic dreams. The stage design tonight brings some of this imagery to the fore. Performing among Rodin-inspired sculptures, fragments of staircases and a line of wooden chairs arranged like a church pew, the band play feverishly, pushing the songs to their limit in lockstep as if the whole night is on the brink of collapse.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/18/christine-and-the-queens-review-meltdown-royal-festival-hall-london">Continue reading...</a>

It was an abrupt about-face from the court, that has otherwise slowly chipped away at the law over the last decade. “In recent years, this statute has fared not well in this court,” Elena Kagan said of the Voting Rights Act during oral argument in October.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/18/alabama-supreme-court-allen-milligan">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Lyric Hammersmith theatre, London</strong><br />Jocelyn Bioh’s bitingly funny and sometimes heartbreaking play transposes relatable high-school movie tropes to 1980s Ghana to explore beauty standards and colourism</p><p>All the standard high-school movie tropes are in here: there’s the queen bee and her adoring/terrified acolytes; the enticing new girl; the stern headmistress with a heart of gold. But in transplanting this overworn format to Ghana in the 80s, Ghanaian American writer Jocelyn Bioh has sharpened up it up and created a funny but biting play packed with clever laughs that come with a stinging afterburn.</p><p>School Girls premiered in the US in 2017 and is inspired by a real-life event in 2011, when a US-born, Minnesota-raised mixed-race woman – with arguably a better hope of faring well on a global stage – was named winner of the Miss Universe Ghana beauty pageant. It’s a story that raises difficult questions about who defines beauty, and the awful knock-on effects it can have. Yet despite this specific context, there is plenty about Monique Touko’s warm and engaging production that will feel painfully and amusingly familiar to everyone. The terrible fragility of teenage friendship. The need to fit in yet also stand out. That burning desire for a big and beautiful future.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/18/school-girls-or-the-african-mean-girls-play-review-lyric-hammersmith">Continue reading...</a>

You can also find them in corner shops and online. Crack the outer shell and inside there’s a fibre that holds pulp – tangy, with a slightly sweet undertone – and seeds together. Take the shell off, soak the sticky insides in hot water for about half an hour, then mash it up, take out the seeds and you’ll have a thick brown liquid.</p><p>In Mauritius, where I’m from, we add it to soups and stews at the end of cooking.

## Minette Batters: ‘We need a success story for wild spaces but also for farmers and food’

<p>Sharing a cheeseboard, the farmers’ leader tells of frustrating tussles with ministers … and why she has decided to stand down as president of the NFU</p><p>A colleague of Minette Batters used to offer her a favourite piece of grandmother’s wisdom: “Things will never be as good as you hope they are going to be and will never be as bad as you fear they are going to be.” In the five years since Batters became the first female president of the National Farmers’ Union, the latter part of that saying has, she says, not been much use at all. “Things have been much worse in the sector than any of us could have imagined,” she says. “We had hard Brexit, the pandemic, and then Russia invaded Ukraine.” Among the most visible results of that tragic trio have been soaring food prices and sometimes <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/26/yes-we-have-no-tomatoes-why-shelves-are-emptying-in-uk-stores" title="">empty supermarket shelves</a>, failing farms and labour shortages.

She’s been up early morning and late at night helping with the lambing at her farm in Wiltshire, as well as keeping on top of her day job at the NFU in London. After a round of media on the latest eye-watering inflation figures that morning, she is due to appear before the environmental audit committee of MPs that afternoon – so, tempting though it is, she won’t have a glass of wine. She is in training for a marathon at the weekend, however, so carbs are welcome.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/18/minette-batters-we-need-a-success-story-for-wild-spaces-but-also-for-farmers-and-food">Continue reading...</a>

Many of us feel the anxiety of living in a time of ‘polycrisis’, but taking a long view will help you cope<p>One February night in a London hospital, my perception of time shrunk to the span of a moment. Around 24 hours after my wife went into labour, we were rushed into emergency surgery. Our baby had acquired an infection. As I held my wife’s hand in the sterile silence of the operating theatre, it felt like nothing else in the world existed. Our recent past of slow, stable expectation faded away and the future became impossible to see with any fidelity – all that was left was now.</p><p>We were lucky; the threat receded, and after five nights of recovery and antibiotics, we stepped out of the timeless maternity ward and back into the world, carrying our daughter, Grace. Gradually, our future as a new family settled into view.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/18/self-and-wellbeing-polycrisis-time-anxiety">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Twickenham Stadium, London</strong><br />Dave Gahan is a mic-spinning, limb-bending, theatrical marvel as the band gallop through decades’ worth of hits. And the presence of Andrew Fletcher, the keyboardist who died last year, is touchingly felt</p><p>Depeche Mode have been thrilling stadiums for 35 years now. Immortalised in their classic tour movie 101, their first ever megashow, at the Pasadena Rosebowl, established rules of engagement which pertain to this day. You shall sing the Thatcher-baiting chorus of Everything Counts over and over while frontman Dave Gahan holds out his microphone. You shall follow Gahan’s cue to sway your arms from side to side during Never Let Me Down Again. Still, much has changed. The four young men from Essex who appeared on the cover of 101 like a synth-pop Beatles became first a trio and then, with the premature death of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/27/andrew-fletcher-the-pop-loving-everyman-who-held-depeche-mode-together">keyboardist Andrew Fletcher</a> last year, a duo.

The video for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIyrLRixMs8">Ghosts Again</a>, their best single in many years, shows the duo playing chess in homage to The Seventh Seal, while the show’s key visual motif is a skull. Fletcher’s subtly animated face fills the screens during World in My Eyes, providing a necessary moment of phone-waving communal remembrance in a stadium where diehards in old tour T-shirts mingle with a refreshing number of younger converts.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/18/depeche-mode-review-twickenham-stadium-london">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A white couple challenged an adoption law that protects Native children. Thankfully, the conservative court didn’t buy their argument</p><p>A white couple in Texas felt racially discriminated against when facing barriers to adopting a Navajo child. Backed by powerful corporate interests and other non-Native families, the Brackeens brought their grievance to the US supreme court and attempted to overturn the Indian Child Welfare Act, or ICWA. The “rights” of individuals thereby stood against the collective rights of entire nations of people who were here first in a legal system not of their own making. The Brackeens argued that the law privileges Indians as a race over others, including white families, and is, therefore, unconstitutional. The argument reeked of “reverse racism”, a bogus notion that measures taken to protect marginalized people end up harming white people.</p><p>The ICWA, however, was <a href="https://www.nicwa.org/about-icwa/">designed</a> to reverse a sordid history of Native family separation that benefited white families seeking to adopt Native children. More importantly, the law guarantees that federally recognized tribes have a say in their children’s futures by keeping them with Native families. Those determinations are not based on race but on the political status of tribes and the rights of their members.</p><p>Nick Estes is a member of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe and an assistant professer of American Indian Studies at the University of Minnesota.

They look like cerulean eyes, inviting you in. “I love this colour, it is the typical shade of the windows of houses in this part of the Cévennes,” explains Sophie Zieleskiewicz, an interior decorator originally from Lyon.</p><p>When she and her husband, Ian, first saw the property – an 18th-century farm, where silkworms were once raised – they immediately knew they had found what they were looking for. The beautiful town of Uzès is just a few kilometres away and Provence is on the other side of the Rhone. It’s a much-loved tourist destination, yet untainted by mass tourism.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/18/unpicking-the-past-a-french-farmhouse-gets-a-smooth-new-look">Continue reading...</a>

Early summer lunches that are simple and yet perfectly tasty<p>There was roast chicken, the still warm, lemony juices pooling on the plate; the rustle of fried potatoes with ice-cold cucumber and a smear of mayonnaise, peppery with chopped rocket. An apparently effortless summer lunch, hiding the fact that I had made the mayonnaise by hand – there is no more perfect addition to a summer’s lunch – and scrubbed each and every potato, some of which were barely bigger than a broad bean.</p><p>The second salad, served on a platter to be passed around, was one of broad beans, radishes and pecorino, a salad so much the essence of early summer and dressed with appropriate simplicity. I will not complicate these early summer lunches, but instead take painstaking care over the skinning of beans and scrubbing of potatoes or whipping an egg yolk and oil dressing until it shines and stands in proud peaks. Summer tasks as old as the hills.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/18/nigel-slater-recipes-for-fried-new-potatoes-and-broad-beans-with-radishes">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Luckily the great British public were on hand to help Laura Kuennsberg correct the record last week</p><p>On last Sunday’s BBC politics show, presenter Laura Kuenssberg spoke to the energy secretary, Grant Shapps. On this occasion Shapps manifested as himself, rather than as one of the many false identities he used to inhabit when promoting his internet business. I always find Shapps’s appearances as himself uncomfortable, a bit like when Mike Yarwood used to say “and this is me!” at the end of his impressionist shows and then sing an old jazz standard in a weird American accent while squinting and waving his hands. Like Yarwood, Shapps himself seems more improbable than the people he pretended to be.</p><p>Because to me Shapps will always be Michael Green. Or Sebastian Fox. Or, proving Shapps a pioneer of now-commonplace gender fluidity, Corinne Stockheath, a name so blandly insane that, I will never tire of pointing out, no one else ever had it. Ever. Come on everyone!

<p>The commentator is stepping back from Sky after three decades and his perennial presence and enthusiasm will be missed</p><p>At Sky Sports, they still called him “the Voice”. Richard Keys, the long-serving anchorman to Martin Tyler in the commentary box, claimed this weekend this was because Tyler “definitely didn’t have a face for TV” – throwing us back to a now distant, coarser era of broadcasting.</p><p>At 77, Tyler is the perennial who floated above the eras. Viewers of 40-plus will recall his career extending far further back than before football began in 1992. At both the 1982 and 1986 World Cups, Tyler acted as ITV’s main commentator while Brian Moore stayed in a London studio before flying out for the latter tournament’s final. Back in the days of regional highlights making up ITV’s Big Match programme, Tyler was the voice of Yorkshire TV football and then Granada in the north-west. The more clipped Tyler of the pre-Sky years is prime commentary from an era of less meaning more.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jun/18/martin-tylers-voice-and-love-for-the-game-are-a-constant-between-football-eras">Continue reading...</a>

The fourth of the leading pack is an unidentified man in a plain white singlet.</p><p>Entering the home straight, the man in white moves into second place.

<p>It’s a dad and lad week and all bets are off. But when duty calls, big brother is happy to do his duty</p><p>My wife calls me from Ireland. The baby has been acting up, barely eating and refusing to sleep. Since she doesn’t have a temperature, we’re content she doesn’t have a fever, and wonder aloud if there’s a sleep regression we’ve missed. This is likely, as we realise neither of us have used the term ‘sleep regression’ since our son was her age, when such phrases held biblical significance to us both. Back then, we knew the timelines of sleep regressions and growth leaps as if they were our own medical histories. In the years since, a combination of gained experience, increased confidence and an undeniable amount of sheer exhaustion means this has not been the case with our daughter, who’s been raised, basically, on vibes.</p><p>I try to console and counsel, but find I can be of little help. I’m in London and she’s still in Dublin as we have no childcare this week and her parents, with a grace and kindness we can never repay, are minding the baby during the day while she works from their spare room. I, meanwhile, have travelled back home to Walthamstow with our son, for a week of solo parenting. Just in time for Father’s Day, I expected it to be a strong test of my parenting mettle, but my wife’s experience has put mine in the shade, and I squirm a bit as I tell her we’ve been having a wonderful time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/18/home-alone-with-my-son-we-decide-to-enter-the-boyzone">Continue reading...</a>

## Beth Mead: ‘I told Saka just to curtsy when he sees me!’

<p>The Arsenal and England footballer on her MBE, her terrible singing voice – and the best and worst year of her life</p><p>Beth Mead became a national hero last summer as the breakout star of the England women’s team who triumphed at the 2022 Euros. The 28-year-old Arsenal forward followed that by winning the BBC Sports Personality of the Year and being made an MBE. She will, however, miss this summer’s Women’s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand after rupturing her anterior cruciate ligament last November. Born in Yorkshire, Mead now lives in Hertfordshire with her partner, fellow Arsenal forward Vivianne Miedema. Mead’s debut book for younger readers, the nonfiction <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/roar-9781526365866">Roar</a></em> – which aims to inspire children to pursue their dreams – is out this month.</p><p><strong>You’ve had a busy few weeks: it’s been your birthday and you’ve been presented with an MBE. What’s been the highlight?<br /></strong>Well, in football terms I’m getting old now, so my birthday is not a happy thing any more! Obviously, I don’t think you can top the MBE. I met Prince William, we got to go to Windsor Castle – that was pretty surreal. And I got to do it with my dad, my brother and my partner, Viv, so that was a very proud moment.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/18/beth-mead-book-roar-bukayo-saka-mbe-interview">Continue reading...</a>

## Millions are facing soaring mortgage rates. How did we leave them so vulnerable? | Will Hutton

Homeowners in Britain are especially at risk because of a shortage of long-term loans. The sooner the Bank of England acts to fix this the better<p>There is a cross-party consensus that Britain as a property-owning democracy should promote home ownership. To that end, 7.5 million people hold a record <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/data/commentary-mortgage-lending-statistics-q1-2023" title="">£1.7tn of mortgage debt</a>. Yet that debt is more exposed to short-term movements in interest rates than in any other advanced country – placing millions of households in danger of extreme privation when, as now, interest rates suddenly rise. It is a lack of duty of care bordering on criminal neglect.</p><p>By next December, cumulatively 4.4 million households will have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jun/17/uk-homeowners-face-huge-rise-in-payments-when-fixed-rate-mortgages-expire" title="">forced to refix</a> their mortgages at steeply higher rates since Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine last February and interest rates started climbing. Then, two-year fixed-rate mortgages were available at under 3%: today they cost close to 6%. The Resolution Foundation thinktank, assuming that the two-year fix will remain above 6% until next year, estimates that mortgage holders’ <a href="https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/the-mortgage-crunch/" title="">annual payments will jump</a> by £15.8bn as their two-year fixes come to an end. Given that so few households have more than £2,000 of savings, the <a href="https://ifs.org.uk/publications/characteristics-and-consequences-families-low-levels-financial-wealth" title="">Institute for Fiscal Studies</a> forecasts 2.9 million mortgage holders exhausting their savings completely.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/18/millions-are-facing-soaring-mortgage-rates-how-did-we-leave-them-so-vulnerable">Continue reading...</a>

Wherever he went he drew large crowds. Leaving the European project, he told voters, would allow the UK to take back control of its money, its laws and its borders.</p><p>While the Vote Leave slogans cut through because they were simple (if often misleading), there were also high-minded constitutional themes, central to the great Johnson-led push for freedom.

Before her death last year, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/14/carmen-herrera-obituary">at the age of 106</a>, she designed its set – a great slash of green in acres of white, a triangular sculpture.</p><p>The shape of its title (<em>Untitled</em>, followed by a date) is informed by the way she often named her geometric, abstract paintings. More importantly, the shape of McGregor’s choreography feels impelled by her clarity, by her cool concerns. The green and white costumes by Burberry carve the dancers’ bodies into angular forms; lighting designer Lucy Carter bathes the entire stage in shifting washes of subtle colour.

## Shakespeare Was a Woman and Other Heresies review – in search of the bard

<p>Diligent scholarship meets provocation and irreverence in Elizabeth Winkler’s highly entertaining quest to uncover the ‘real’ Shakespeare</p><p>In 2019, Elizabeth Winkler, a young writer at the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, published a provocative essay in the<em> Atlantic</em> under the headline “Was Shakespeare a Woman?” In it she examined the case for seeing the hand of Emilia Bassano Lanier, a poet of Italian heritage born in the 16th century, in the plays attributed to the actor from Stratford-upon-Avon. The theory had been in circulation for a while – in 2018, the Globe theatre staged Morgan Lloyd Malcolm’s sellout play <em>Emilia</em>, which dramatised a similar argument – but Winkler was unprepared for the scale of the backlash. Within 48 hours of the article’s publication, “I was besieged by a (mostly male) army of Twitter trolls,” she writes in this riposte to her detractors. The professional scholars were hardly more civilised: older, male academics and critics called her a conspiracy theorist, comparing her to Holocaust deniers, Obama birthers and anti-vaxxers; others declared her to be “in the grip of “neurotic fantasies”. Alarmed by the “ferocity of the internet reaction”, the<em> Atlantic</em> commissioned a series of responses to the piece, including a rebuttal by the eminent Shakespearean Prof James Shapiro, and altered some of Winkler’s assertions in the original in deference to his objections. “The professor said so, it must be true,” she remarks drily.</p><p>Far from being cowed by the condescension (Shapiro invited her to attend a performance of Shakespeare in New York, “as though I had never read or seen a Shakespeare play before”), Winkler – who is no upstart, holding English literature degrees from Princeton and Stanford – was spurred to greater curiosity by the vitriol. “Scepticism is usually a virtue in the scholarly world, but when it comes to Shakespeare, scepticism is a sin,” she writes. “There can be no recognition of ambiguities or uncertainties in our construction of the past. There is only adherence to the belief, which operates like a kind of religious fundamentalism… Anything else is a ‘conspiracy theory’.” She began to wonder: “Why were they so emotional?”</p><p><em>Shakespeare Was a Woman and Other Heresies: How Doubting the Bard Became the Biggest Taboo in Literature</em> by Elizabeth Winkler is published by Simon &amp; Schuster (£20).

It’s a play he created with the director Tom Morris, of <em>War Horse</em> fame, which premiered at the Bristol Old Vic last year. The drama explores the life of a Hungarian doctor, Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in the maternity wards of 19th-century Vienna.

Sunny days and grey days will both damage your skin, so SPF is essential, but if it’s part of your makeup you’ll never forget<p>Everyone wants to hear about SPF when it’s sunny but, as I often say, we need suncare all year around. People still see suncare as a faff and so it’s easier (but unwise) to skip it. For ease, try makeup that comes with an SPF. There are lip colours that double as blush and provide the eyes with a matching hue. There are also skin tints with lightweight textures (excellent for the heat) that give you a sun-kissed finish and a good foundation, but also protect you from the sun. <em>Voilà</em>!

We’ve had our fill of prestige TV recently, but sitting back and enjoying the tawdry antics of celebrities battling it out in court is a totally different pleasure<p>I want to be entertained. I find current entertainment lacking. Find my own entertainment? No thank you – I’d like my entertainment presented to me, cut up into bite-size pieces, occasionally pre-chewed. Is that too much to ask? Honestly? That somebody else is responsible for my <em>fun</em>? For bringing something fabulous? Something <em>delightful</em>? After many months consuming prestige TV as if a Michelin meal, dodging online spoilers, I am entering a time in my life where I would like to sit low in a beanbag chair and have a little excitement, a little joy poured directly down my throat like a foie-gras goose. Currently, I have to settle for less.</p><p>It is no coincidence that reports of the end of “prestige TV” coincide with my own personal exhaustion of the stuff – I have, I believe, singlehandedly maintained this industry through my personal relentless viewing. There is not an award-winning drama I haven’t watched, there is not a darkly comic show investigating grief and/or trauma I haven’t mainlined with biscuits, there is not a philosophical American review I haven’t read solemnly at midnight, occasionally looking up Shakespeare references by the light of a phone.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/18/watching-celebs-in-court-raises-drama-to-a-whole-new-low">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The annual event has been hijacked by online stores flogging merchandise, but there’s more to being a dad than beer and hot sauce</p><p>In the <em>Peppa Pig</em> episode entitled Father’s Day, pater familias Daddy Pig wakes up to find that … guess what? Everyone in his family has totally forgotten the annual day in his honour. (In case you’ve missed it too, yes, Father’s Day is today, at least in the UK.) When he reminds them, his daughter Peppa asks if it’s like Mother’s Day. “Sort of,” replies Mummy Pig. “Although Mother’s Day is a real day. And Father’s Day is a sort of made-up, modern thing.”</p><p>After some back and forth, Daddy Pig gets his dream of watching racing cars on TV with a cup of tea while his children make a cake. They combine his favourite ingredients – cereal, tomato ketchup and cheese – and serve it to him as the narrator concludes: “Daddy Pig loves Father’s Day. Everyone loves Father’s Day!”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/18/are-you-daddy-pig-or-logan-roy-a-fathers-day-celebration-of-dads">Continue reading...</a>

<p>World’s best female T20 and ODI bowler takes on a more senior role at just 24 as her Australian friends visit for a busy summer</p><p>English cricket has one internationally top-ranked player. She is not at fortress Edgbaston vibing with the Hollies Stand, but preparing for the start of her own summer campaign. Sophie Ecclestone is the world’s No 1 female T20 and ODI bowler. She first hit that mark in 2020 and has held on pretty tightly since, unusually combining supremacy on the field with remaining below the radar off it.</p><p>In the words of her captain, Heather Knight: “Soph is pretty direct and to the point. What you see is what you get.” Still only 24, she has been playing international cricket since she was 17. A slow left armer with extraordinary accuracy and strength, she stands at 5ft 11in (1.8m), her big hands allowing lots of purchase on the ball.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/18/sophie-ecclestone-ashes-england-cricket">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Low-wage migrant workers who made the tournament possible now find themselves broke and homeless or even deported or imprisoned</p><p>Six months on from that most memorable of World Cup finals, Shakir Ullah has been forgotten. Ullah, from Pakistan, spent the tournament employed as a security guard but has now been in jail in Qatar for almost five months. He was detained in late January as he tried to resolve a dispute over unpaid wages on behalf of hundreds of his co-workers. The men were deployed to guard key sites during the World Cup but were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/may/26/world-cup-security-guards-still-jailed-in-qatar-after-dispute-over-unpaid-wages">suddenly laid off</a> in the days after the final, with about three months on their contracts.</p><p>The abrupt termination – in breach of Qatar’s labour law – left them homeless, jobless and in many cases, deep in debt. On that day, about 250 of them were detained and later deported. Ullah and two others were arrested and remain in prison. He has allegedly been sentenced to six months and fined 10,000 rials (£2,170); more than he made in the three months he worked at the World Cup. His appeal against the sentence was recently rejected. One source told the <em>Observer</em> that if he fails to pay the fine, his detention may be extended.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/18/world-cup-security-staff-suffer-in-the-silence-of-qatars-broken-promises">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Natey Jones and Alexandra Burke play a couple tussling with dreams and secret shame in Dionne Edwards’s defiant yet uplifting drama with music at its core</p><p>This feisty, uplifting Brit pic arrives in UK cinemas just weeks after the announcement of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/24/tina-turner-obituary">death of Tina Turner</a> – an indomitable figure who serves as an inspirational role model for at least one of the film’s key characters. Indeed, there’s more than a hint of the great soul singer’s spirit in the very likable and slyly subversive feature debut from writer-director Dionne Edwards. Like Turner, <em>Pretty Red Dress</em> is both playful and defiant, swept along on a tide of toe-tapping tunes that tug at the heartstrings, yet unafraid to face up to complex personal issues while still maintaining its solidly mainstream appeal.</p><p>Rising star Natey Jones puts an enticing twist on performative machismo as Travis, a young man whom we meet at the end of a spell in prison. Waiting for him is partner Candice, played with understated flair by <em>X</em><em> Factor </em>winner turned chart-topper and star of stage and screen <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/aug/09/alexandra-burke-i-got-asked-to-bleach-my-skin-after-x-factor">Alexandra Burke</a>. A diehard Tina fan, Candice is facing a dream role – an opportunity to audition for the lead in a West End show about her idol. Travis wants them to pick up where they left off before his incarceration; to re-establish himself as the man of the house. But relations with their daughter Kenisha (talented screen newcomer Temilola Olatunbosun) have become strained as she deals with the emotional uncertainties of adolescence.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/18/pretty-red-dress-review-toe-tapping-london-tale-of-desire-and-identity-alexandra-burke-natey-jones-dionne-edwards">Continue reading...</a>

The African leaders were seeking agreement on a series of “confidence building measures”, telling the Russian president it was time to negotiate an end to fighting, which they said was harming the entire world.</p><p>After <strong>presentations from the Comoran, Senegalese and South African presidents</strong>, Putin challenged the assumptions of the plan. He reiterated his position that Ukraine and its western allies started the conflict and said Russia had never refused talks with the Ukrainian side, but these had been blocked by Kyiv. Moscow says any peace must allow for “new realities”, meaning its declared but globally unrecognised annexation of five Ukrainian provinces, <strong>four of which it only partially controls</strong> – a red line for Kyiv.</p><p><strong>South Africa’s president told Putin that the fighting had to stop</strong>. “This war must be settled … through negotiations and through diplomatic means,” said Cyril Ramaphosa after talks in the suburbs of St Petersburg.</p><p><strong>Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, confirmed troops were “engaged in active moves” to advance the counteroffensive in the south.</strong> Ukrainian forces around Bakhmut, captured by Russia last month, were trying to push Russian forces out from the outskirts of the devastated city. Russia did not officially acknowledge Ukrainian advances and said it inflicted heavy losses on Kyiv’s forces in the previous 24 hours.</p><p><strong>Two people died after a Russian missile strike on a village in the Kharkiv region in the north-east of Ukraine, said the regional governor, Oleh Synehubov.</strong> Synehubov said on Telegram that Russian forces shelled the village of Huryiv Kozachok. An anti-tank guided missile hit a car driving towards the village, which is near the border with Russia.</p><p><strong>Jens Stoltenberg was expected to be asked to remain as Nato secretary general for another year, a Reuters source said.</strong> Stoltenberg’s term has been prolonged three times and he is due to step down in September after nine years. The Norwegian had broad support and continued to be an effective leader, said the source, who requested anonymity. The chances of Stoltenberg being asked to stay on have increased as Nato’s summit in Vilnius has neared, with allies fearing any show of disunity during Russia’s war in Ukraine.</p><p><strong>Russia’s defence minister, </strong>Sergei Shoigu, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/17/russian-forces-face-shortage-of-tanks-as-counteroffensive-creeps-forward-ukraine">visited a military factory</a> in western Siberia and stressed the need “to maintain the increased production of tanks”, the defence ministry said. Agence France-Presse reported that Shoigu said this was necessary “to satisfy the needs of Russian forces carrying out the special military operation” in Ukraine.</p><p><strong>Moscow said troops destroyed three drones targeting an oil refinery in the southern border region of Bryansk. </strong>The regional governor, Alexander Bogomaz, said: “Russian air defence systems repelled an overnight attack by the Ukrainian armed forces on the Druzhba oil refinery in the district of Novozybkov. Thanks to the professionalism of our military … three aerial drones were destroyed.”</p><p><strong>Vladimir Putin</strong> <strong>confirmed Russia had deployed its first tranche of tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus.</strong> He said nuclear weapons would only be used in the event of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jun/16/russia-ukraine-war-live-150-children-abducted-from-luhansk-and-taken-to-russia-says-ukraine?page=with:block-648c74ef8f08abfd8db3e248#block-648c74ef8f08abfd8db3e248">a threat to the existence of the Russian state</a>.

Most people, who feared the financial consequences of poor health, had their lives transformed. To use the vapid language of today, this was industrial scale levelling up.</p><p>For a population unused to state munificence, the leaflet posted through every door headed “The New National Health Service” must have read like a fairy story.

For 20-ish seconds, Ayling-Ellis and her partner, Giovanni Pernice, danced both in total silence and synchronicity. It was a fleeting insight into how <em>Strictly</em>’s first deaf contestant experienced the show; a simple yet soul-stirring nod to the community she takes such pride in representing. So, of course, Ayling-Ellis recalls exactly how she felt when sitting down to watch those monumental moves being proposed.

Elizabeth Gilbert was wrong to stop her novel being published on account of its setting<p>On 4 September 1939, the day after Britain had declared war on Germany, the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/events/rjbnc8/by/date/1939/09/04" title="">BBC Proms opened with extracts from Richard Wagner’s works</a> including <em>The Mastersingers of Nuremberg</em>, <em>Götterdämmerung</em>, <em>Tristan and Isolde</em>, <em>Tannhäuser</em> and <em>Die Walküre</em>. Later concerts that year included works by Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, Mendelssohn, Strauss and a lot of Wagner. The BBC may have been an instrument of Britain’s war effort but few of even the most patriotic Britons thought it immoral to play the works of the great German classical composers.</p><p>The following year, the BBC Symphony Orchestra, which had relocated to Bristol, opened its 1940 concert series with a performance in which the entire second half was given over to Wagner.

Only a general election and a new government can give politics the clean slate it so badly needs<p>We did not need the verdict of the privileges committee to understand the flaws in Boris Johnson’s character. It was clear long before he became prime minister how manifestly unsuited he was for any kind of public office, let alone running the country. But a cross-party group of MPs last week published a damning report that outlined how he deliberately misled parliament about the scale and nature of wrongdoing in Downing Street during the pandemic. He may now be gone from politics, but the serious questions for the Conservative party – how on earth so many of its MPs were willing to propel him to and sustain him in Number 10 during the worst national crisis in decades – remain hanging over Rishi Sunak’s premiership.</p><p>As the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/15/partygate-report-key-findings-of-commons-privileges-committee-boris-johnson" title="">privileges committee outlines</a> in its report, for a minister to deliberately deceive the Commons is a matter of great national importance.

## Lose your bottle: wines to pack for picnics

Alfresco drinks in tins and pouches that won’t weigh you down<br /><p><strong>M&amp;S Coteaux Varois en Provence, France 2022 (£17.50, 1.5l, <a href="https://www.marksandspencer.com/">Marks &amp; Spencer</a></strong><strong>) </strong>Quite apart from its contents, the glass wine bottle as an object can be a very beautiful thing, and when it comes to seeing a wine through years or even decades of slow maturation it still can’t be beaten. But it isn’t always the most practical of tools. One issue is weight. Even if many producers (if not, sadly, all) have belatedly realised that it makes little environmental sense to use the heaviest glass available and are ditching the 800g+ behemoths, tThere are times when even a lightweight 300g 75cl glass vessel adds rather too much to a picnic basket or backpack. A little too much danger, too, if you’re even a fraction as clumsy as me. So, I’m glad, not least as we enter official picnic season, that the quality of wine being sold in what the industry describes as ‘alternative packaging’ continues to improve, meaning that an eminently shareable, classically soft, creamy Provence rosé such as M&amp;S’s is, in pouch form, now much easier and safer to transport, if rather less lovely to look at.</p><p><strong>Les Dauphins Côtes du Rhône Grenache Syrah, France NV (£3.49, 25cl, <a href="https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/les-dauphins-cotes-du-rhone/742352-795142-795143">Waitrose</a></strong><strong>)</strong><strong> </strong>For the past two years, Waitrose has shared the precise weight of all its packaging when it shows off its range of wines, beers and spirits at the bi-annual tastings it puts on for the press. The differences are eye-opening: the (empty) packaging of a 2.25 litre bag-in-box of aptly named Vibrant &amp; Grassy Chilean White Wine 2022 (£14.95) weighs 150g; if the same amount of wine was bottled in the lightest bottles on display (3 x 300g), the packaging would be six times heavier. Even more striking, the packaging for a 25cl can of brambly-spicy Les Dauphins Côtes du Rhône is 15g, while the 75cl bottle used for the same producer’s richer, gutsier (but that’s beside the point here) Costières de Nîmes 2022 (£8.49, Waitrose) is 395g. All these weight worries are about much more than consumer convenience. The transportation of heavy bottles contributes enormously and (in almost all cases) unnecessarily to increasing wine’s carbon footprint. Shedding a few kilos is essential if the wine industry’s constant references to sustainability are going to amount to more than greenwashing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/18/lose-your-bottle-wines-to-pack-for-picnics">Continue reading...</a>

There are, of course, restaurants in that part of London. There are rooms with tables and chairs where food will be brought to you in return for money. But it’s a bafflingly dreary proposition: there’s a Wagamama, a Côte, a Strada, a Giraffe, a Las Iguanas and so on. I have nothing against any of these, or at least nothing too spittle-flecked. Brands like this have their place. They do a job. It’s not always the most brilliant job. None of them serve the best version of the food they advertise. Nor is it cheap. But it is, I suppose, reliable. In a grinding, it-must-be-a-Thursday-evening-in-Guildford sort of way. This is not meant as an insult to all the valiant independent restaurants of Guildford. It’s meant as an insult to all the other ones.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/18/la-gamba-london-a-pleasing-take-on-the-spanish-repertoire-restaurant-review">Continue reading...</a>

We tried the tough approach: “Drag him in!” That backfired. We tried the parental support approach, either his dad or I sitting in the school library. That worked, but we also have jobs to go to.

To get to the heart of what drives Russia’s leader, look not to Freud but theories of dehumanisation and violence<p>Peter Pomerantsev courageously draws attention to the relevance of psychoanalysis if we wish to understand what might be called the “Putin phenomenon”, but Freud’s “death instinct” explains little (“<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/11/ecocide-russia-ukraine-war-kakhovka-dam-destroyed" title="">What lies behind Russia’s acts of extreme violence? Freudian analysis offers an answer</a>”, Comment).</p><p>The Putin phenomenon is an example of what David Astor, former editor of the <em>Observer</em>, called “the scourge”, that is, a perverse morality that imposes on those who subscribe to it the moral or religious duty to clean up society and liquidate those who pollute it. In Nazi Germany, the Jews and others were singled out as the chief agents of corruption, while for Putin they are “neo-nazis” and those who espouse the decadent values of the west.

While it’s not an untrue statement – early singles <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CPeHQHAQyo">Heart to Break</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXlgR4hJFGQ">Malibu</a>, both the work of controversial producer Dr Luke, definitely bang – actual hits had been conspicuous by their absence. That all changed last year with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9gPaIzbe8">Unholy</a>, Petras’s Grammy-winning, global No 1 duet with Sam Smith.</p><p>Unholy appears on <em>Feed the Beast</em> as a bonus track, its mix of Sophie-esque experimentation and pop nous showing up some of the album’s lesser moments. It’s not that meticulously polished songs such as King of Hearts, Revelations or Alone are bad, more that they instantly remind you of the work of other pop stars, be it Ava Max, Lady Gaga or Charli XCX. Static where it should be elastic, brash instead of bold, the hyperpop-adjacent maelstrom often smothers Petras’s personality. When everything clicks, however, there are flashes of pure pop ecstasy, specifically Claws’s sugar rush chorus, and the featherlight Minute’s emotionally loaded desperation. Overall, though, <em>Feed the Beast</em> feels rushed and already a little stale.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/18/kim-petras-feed-the-beast-review-impersonal-debut-misses-the-mark">Continue reading...</a>

<ul><li>Fowler leads on 10 under with Clark; McIlroy nine under</li><li>McIlroy’s last won a major in 2014, the year Fowler came closest</li></ul><p>Eighteen holes sit between Rickie Fowler or Rory McIlroy and one of golf’s great redemption stories. It sounds and looks so blissfully simple.</p><p>It would be utter folly, of course, to insist the 123rd US Open is now the domain of only two competitors. It is just that Fowler or McIlroy would deliver the finest tales. The $3.6m first prize would be irrelevant to both. This is about status, reputation and a return to golf’s top table.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/18/rory-mcilroy-and-rickie-fowler-redemption-stories-to-inspire-final-round-duel-at-us-open">Continue reading...</a>
