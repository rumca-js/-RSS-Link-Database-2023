A few weeks ago I flew to Anchorage to play for the </span>

<a href="https://www.thedancingbears.com/Dance-Camp.html">Dancing Bears
Dance Camp</a> with the 

<a href="https://www.freeraisins.com/">Free
Raisins</a>.  It was really fun to play with Amy and Audrey again, to
dance to 

<a href="https://kgbmole.com/kgb/index.html">KGB</a>, to meet
people from dance communities all over Alaska, and to visit the
farthest North I've been.  Some pictures from the trip, with thoughts
hanging off them.



<p>

Now that I work <a href="https://www.naobservatory.org/">with
wastewater</a> I'm much more interested in sewage treatment plants.
Here's Boston's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer_Island_Waste_Water_Treatment_Plant">Deer
Island plant, right next to the airport:

I love looking out the window on flights, and occasionally get <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/playing-with-aerial-photos">decent pictures</a>.  Here's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton,_Ontario">Hamilton</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burlington,_Ontario">Burlington</a>,

Looking SE from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Ridge_station_(Illinois)">Park
Ridge Station</a> along the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Pacific_Northwest_Line">UP-NW
Line</a> towards downtown <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago">Chicago</a>:

</p>
<p>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/alaska-trip-chicago-park-ridge-big.jpg"><img class="mobile-fullwidth" height="576" src="https://www.jefftk.com/alaska-trip-chicago-park-ridge.jpg" width="550" /><div class="image-vertical-spacer"></div></a>

</p>
<p>

Even though I left Chicago at 7pm it stayed light the entire way
there, making for pretty good views.  Lots of clouds approaching
Anchorage, but they broke as we flew West along <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnagain_Arm">Turnagain Arm</a>,
following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seward_Highway">road</a> (and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Railroad">train</a>) West from
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whittier,_Alaska">Whittier</a>
(internet-famous for its density, with almost everyone living in a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begich_Towers">single apartment
building</a>).  In the lower right you can see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beluga_Point_Site">Beluga
Point</a>, which we later visited terrestrially:

</p>
<p>

The Anchorage suburbs felt a lot like other parts of the US, except
from almost anywhere there was some direction you could look to see
snow-covered mountains:

</p>
<p>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/alaska-trip-gas-station-mountains-big.jpg"><img class="mobile-fullwidth" height="398" src="https://www.jefftk.com/alaska-trip-gas-station-mountains.jpg" width="550" /><div class="image-vertical-spacer"></div></a>

</p>
<p>

Once we got to the camp and there was less evidence of human
habitation this made it feel a lot like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ross">Bob Ross painting</a>:

</p>
<p>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/alaska-trip-mountains-and-lake-big.jpg"><img class="mobile-fullwidth" height="254" src="https://www.jefftk.com/alaska-trip-mountains-and-lake.jpg" width="550" /><div class="image-vertical-spacer"></div></a>

</p>
<p>

I brought my <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/small-go-boards">5x5 and 7x7 go boards</a>
and got at least a dozen people to give it a try.  You can teach it
quickly, games are fast, and then people can play each other and get a
feel for it:

</p>
<p>

One of the other dancers brought <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/291855/ecologies">Ecologies</a>,
a tableau-building card game.  I enjoyed it, but with six players it
was much too long.  This was partly that five of us were new to the
game, but it doesn't help that it takes time proportional to the
number of players.  It has a draw-decide structure, which I think <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/better-quiddler">nearly always</a> should be rotated to a
decide-draw structure so people can think more on their opponents'
turns.  It also wasn't very well balanced (<a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2803887/why-i-did-not-ecologies">review</a>)
but I enjoyed the trading, card art, and company:

While teaching a session on playing music to support the dancers a
moose wandered by:

While the most common Alaskan contra dancer's car is probably a
Subaru, perhaps the most literal combination of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding">word
embeddings</a> for "Alaskan", "contra dancer", and "car" was one
dancer's lifted Prius:

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

Driving back to our host's, through otherwise normal-feeling suburbia,
we stopped to let three bears cross the road:

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/alaska-trip-bears-2-big.jpg"><img class="mobile-fullwidth" height="349" src="https://www.jefftk.com/alaska-trip-bears-2.jpg" width="550" /><div class="image-vertical-spacer"></div></a>

</p>
<p>

Most of the musicians stayed an extra day to see more of the area, and
we drove to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portage,_Anchorage,_Alaska">Portage</a>,
at the East end of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnagain_Arm">Turnagain Arm</a>
where we hiked up to see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portage_Glacier">glacier</a>:

</p>
<p>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/alaska-trip-portage-glacier-big.jpg"><img class="mobile-fullwidth" height="390" src="https://www.jefftk.com/alaska-trip-portage-glacier.jpg" width="550" /><div class="image-vertical-spacer"></div></a>

</p>
<p>

We also hiked to a small lake where the trees were incredibly mossy:

</p>
<p>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/alaska-trip-mossy-tree-big.jpg"><img class="mobile-fullwidth" height="562" src="https://www.jefftk.com/alaska-trip-mossy-tree.jpg" width="550" /><div class="image-vertical-spacer"></div></a>

</p>
<p>

On the way back we passed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacier_Discovery">Glacier
Discovery</a>, just where it diverges from the main line on its way to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whittier,_Alaska">Whittier</a>.
East of here it runs through a <a>2.5mi one-lane
tunnel</a> that (since 2000) it shares with cars.  This requires <a href="https://dot.alaska.gov/creg/whittiertunnel/schedule.shtml">some
scheduling</a>!

</p>

</p>
<p>

Flying out of Anchorage as the sun set you could see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denali">Danali</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Foraker">Foraker</a> poking
up above the clouds:

</p>
<p>

Back to Boston the next morning, very sleepy, seeing South Boston and
the Conley Container Terminal, with Back Bay and downtown in the
background:
