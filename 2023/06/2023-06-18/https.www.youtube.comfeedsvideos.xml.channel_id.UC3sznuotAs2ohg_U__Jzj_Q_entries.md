Miles Morales has a REAL problem on his hands, Loyal Theorist. In Spider-Man Across the Spider-Verse we find out he unintentionally created his own villain AND that none of the events from the previous movie were meant to happen. Moreover, Peter Park was not supposed to die! Now with the world unraveling around him and Miguel and the Spider Society doing their best to restore the “canon events” we have to ask… could the multiverse actually collapse? Is this Spider-Man movie connected to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)? And does Spider-Man have to DIE?!
