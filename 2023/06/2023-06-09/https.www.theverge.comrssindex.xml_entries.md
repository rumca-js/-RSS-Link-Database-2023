  <p id="6H1EGD">If you’re unhappy with your current password manager and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295354/lastpass-export-delete-bitwarden-1password-zoho">have decided to make a move</a>, you may be tempted to simply go with the password manager that comes with your browser or operating system. It’s certainly an easy solution and a reasonable one, depending on your point of view. Until recently, third-party password managers were known to be more secure, but Apple and Google have been working to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/23/21299007/google-password-checkup-security">make their built-in password managers more secure</a>, while Microsoft has not only got <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/save-or-forget-passwords-in-microsoft-edge-b4beecb0-f2a8-1ca0-f26f-9ec247a3f336">one as part of its Edge browser</a> but has <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/import-passwords-into-the-microsoft-authenticator-app-a167573a-fb3b-4248-91ea-ca9a814f4853">added one to its authenticator app</a>. </p>
<p id="BIrfb8">One way, however, that these built-in password managers haven’t stood up to their independent competitors is how tricky it was to get preexisting passwords into their systems. That,...</p>

  <p id="wLaLB5">In the 2000s, there was a media format war between Sony’s Blu-ray and Toshiba’s HD DVD. Sony, which owns a production company, convinced Warner Bros. to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2008-01-04-warner-drops-hd-dvd-goes-blu-ray-only.html">drop</a> the rival format. And then Paramount <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2008-01-07-paramount-following-warner-out-the-hd-dvd-door.html">followed</a> suit, putting the last two nails in HD DVD’s coffin.</p>
<p id="hUTwIa">Fast-forward to today’s electric vehicle charging standards war, and it feels like déjà vu. Last month, Ford announced it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/25/23737896/ford-tesla-ev-fast-charging-elon-musk-twitter-space">adopting</a> Tesla’s previously proprietary North American Charging Standard (NACS) port for its future vehicles.

The feature, which was previously only available on mobile, uses facial recognition or your fingerprint to verify your identity before Chrome automatically fills your passwords.</p>
<p id="ULceVR">This is ideal if you share a computer with someone else and don’t want Chrome to autofill your account passwords for anyone but yourself. You’ll still need a PC or Mac that comes with a fingerprint sensor or supports facial recognition to actually take advantage of the feature, though.

  <p id="FK2R4u">Back in March, I told you that Sonos is working on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/23/23653411/sonos-move-2-bluetooth-speaker-exclusive-details-features">a second-generation Move speaker</a> due for release this year. And now, as <a href="https://sfba.social/@jank0/110515343881564660">spotted</a> by Janko Roettgers, the upcoming portable speaker has made its way <a href="https://fccid.io/SBVRM044">through the FCC</a>. The filing matches up with my earlier report and identifies the next Sonos hardware product as model S44. </p>
<p id="9431Gb">The FCC documentation also confirms one key upgrade that I mentioned in March: the Move (Gen 2) will support Bluetooth and Wi-Fi at the same time instead of making you toggle between them like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20871409/sonos-move-wireless-bluetooth-speaker-review-alexa-google-assistant-wifi-price-specs-sound-quality">the original speaker did</a> (via a switch on the back). As a result, just like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22368487/sonos-roam-bluetooth-speaker-review-features">Roam</a>, Era 100, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23657335/sonos-era-300-review-spatial-audio-atmos-speaker">Era 300</a>, the next Move will let you play something over Bluetooth and then relay that audio to the rest of your Sonos system. </p>

  <p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="IKl0uy">A couple of years ago, laptop sales were through the roof.

Apple, ever the outlier in so many markets, did manage to squeak out an increase in 2022 over 2021. But the last two quarters have seen the sharpest year-over-year percentage decline in revenue from the Mac in half a decade.

<p id="z5tJ67">While average daily signups rose to 73,000 during this window, marking a 102 percent increase over Netflix’s previous 60-day average, Antenna says the streamer also added 100,000 subscribers on both May 26th and May 27th. That’s more subscribers than Netflix raked in once the covid-related lockdowns went into effect in March and April 2020, according to Antenna.</p>
