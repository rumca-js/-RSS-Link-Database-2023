After she walked out on him – reputedly the only woman to do so – he set about sabotaging her career as an artist.</p><p>But Gilot was no pushover. In 1964 she published an account of their 10-year affair, which <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Life-Picasso-Francoise-Gilot/dp/1853812331" title="">has sold millions of copies</a>.

This wasn’t meant to happen. But as Rick James famously said, Sky Cricket Greats is a hell of a drug. In the event it just turned out to be one of those strangely moreish spectacles.</p><p>A lot of things happened very slowly and then happened suddenly with dramatic jumps forward. Mike Atherton top-scored across the series but still seemed to be continually walking off looking soulful and wronged, sawn off by another grubber. Alex Stewart swished and carved his way to those two brilliant, breezy hundreds in Barbados, hunched in his agreeably old-fashioned stance, sleeves rolled like a cricketer from a 1950s cigarette card. Andy Caddick seemed to be always bowling, from both ends and for both teams.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jun/09/englands-existential-cricket-is-not-fun-and-carefree-but-therapy-for-years-of-cruelty">Continue reading...</a>

## Flamin’ Hot review – under-seasoned Cheetos biopic sticks to the formula

<p>The man who invented Flamin’ Hot Cheetos gets his time in the sun but Eva Longoria’s by-the-numbers drama leaves questions</p><p>A film telling the story of a Mexican American janitor who went onto create a $1bn snack brand fits into Hollywood’s current cultural and creative moment rather perfectly. It’s been a time both of exploring the dramatic origins of everyday products and services (from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/05/air-review-ben-affleck-matt-damon-michael-jordan-nike-shoe">Nike’s Air Jordans</a> to BlackBerry to Tetris to Uber) and of finding more ways to tell diverse stories outside of a prohibitively limited lens, a lens that’s been particularly limited for Latino characters.</p><p>Despite Latino audiences <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/03/31/latinos-hollywood-representation-movies">over-indexing</a> at cinemas in the US (in 2021, they had the highest per capita attendance, averaging 1.7 visits a year compared to 1.3 for white audiences), there remains a disappointing dearth of big screen representation (a report last year showed that just 5.2% of leads in film were Latino or Hispanic). Ahead of this summer’s landmark DC adventure Blue Beetle, centering a rare Latino superhero, Eva Longoria has found an unlikely success story to propel her to the title of film-maker, having cut her teeth on television. Her small-screen tutelage is hard to shake in this earnest and at times efficiently entertaining, yet also rather plodding rags-to-riches tale that aside from the odd flourish, feels very much like a TV movie.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/09/flamin-hot-movie-review-cheetos-eva-longoria">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Grange festival, Hampshire<br /></strong>Director Martin Lloyd-Evans prises open Mozart’s opera’s emotional complexity in a production that might be set in traditional dress but engages with today’s concerns</p><p>This year’s <a href="https://thegrangefestival.co.uk/">Grange festival</a> opens with a new production of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/aug/05/mozart-where-to-start-with-his-music">Mozart</a>’s Così Fan Tutte, conducted by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/kirill-karabits">Kirill Karabits</a> and directed by Martin Lloyd-Evans. It’s a striking piece of theatre, at once traditional and probing: traditional because Lloyd-Evans and his designer Dick Bird keep the original 18th-century Neapolitan setting; probing because Lloyd-Evans carefully and insightfully prises open the opera’s emotional complexities, gradually exposing the moral and sexual hypocrisies at its centre.</p><p>The production’s stance is established during the overture, when we see Guglielmo (Nicholas Lester) buy a locket for Fiordiligi (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvbKHBM9aog">Samantha Clarke</a>) from a vendor in a teeming Neapolitan street, then creep back to visit a brothel, from which he eventually emerges with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7II-oDb47Js">Alessandro Fisher</a>’s Ferrando and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u22da9kAMoo">Christian Senn</a>’s Alfonso, the three of them slightly the worse for wear. It soon becomes glaringly apparent that, in testing Fiordiligi’s fidelity, Guglielmo also intends to spend the winnings from his wager on prostitutes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/09/cosi-fan-tutte-review-mozart-karabits-grange-festival-probing-and-insightful-staging">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The stars’ beautiful, haunting show follows a mother who sues the NHS to stop her child from dying. They open up about parental terror, inequality and dad dancing</p><p>If Best Interests – a drama about a mother who takes the NHS to court after doctors decide to allow her teenage daughter to die – feels too harrowing to countenance, you’re not alone: even the cast can’t bring themselves to watch it. “It was hard enough doing it on the day,” says Sharon Horgan of playing Nicci, the mother in question. Michael Sheen, who co-stars as her husband Andrew – a man devastated by his daughter’s illness but unwilling to back his wife’s appeal – is also avoiding it. “I’m more nervous than usual,” he admits. “I know it’s going to be a difficult watch.”</p><p>That’s an understatement. Best Interests begins with Nicci and Andrew on a train, giddily happy, slightly frisky and, as we soon realise, uncharacteristically carefree. Over the next four hours, we see their relationship falter under the pressure of caring for their younger daughter Marnie (Niamh Moriarty) who has muscular dystrophy, as consultants tell them her condition has progressed beyond all medical intervention – something that leads Nicci to mount a headline-grabbing, life-upending legal challenge. It’s little wonder Horgan had doubts about taking the role in the first place. “I was really nervous about how much this was going to fuck me up,” she says. It ended up being as crushing as she feared. “We spent a lot of time in terrible pain. You have to go to some really awful places to get yourself into that mindset and stay there. Sometimes you come home and go: ‘What kind of a weird job is this?’”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/09/michael-sheen-sharon-horgan-best-interests-interview-jack-thorne-bbc">Continue reading...</a>

He’ll use it to pull in fundraising, it’ll rally his base, it’ll make every Republican beta – which is to say, every Republican – feel they have to swear loyalty to him. Furthermore, it’s already got him right where he most loves to be: with everyone talking about him. And these are all reasonable points – or at least reasonable in a through-the-looking-glass way, given that to many outside observers the United States passed reason two or three election cycles ago.

<p>We run the rule over United’s treble winners and the City team trying to emulate them on Saturday – and select a combined XI</p><p><strong>Manchester United:</strong> Sir Alex Ferguson’s team were masters of harum-scarum wins in defining matches. To claim the Premier League on the final day Tottenham had to be defeated but after 24 minutes a Les Ferdinand goal stunned Old Trafford before United, in blazing sunshine, staged a memorable comeback via David Beckham and Andy Cole. In the FA Cup fourth round United were 1-0 down to Liverpool until the 88th minute, then finishes from Dwight Yorke and Ole Gunnar Solskjær knocked out their great rivals.

The current hospitality climate suggests that, by 2024, my closest “restaurant” on the east London/Essex border could well be the <a href="https://www.cinnabon.com/">Cinnabon</a> concession at my local Asda, a profitable meeting of big brands selling 1,090 calorie-a-whirl, factory-made caramel PecanBons, so my hope is that, by the time the current madness eventually ends, at least some family-run, bespoke, flights of the imagination such as Clay’s will have survived.</p><p>Serving authentic Hyderbadi food that will puzzle anyone looking for a garish orange chicken tikka masala with half-rice, half-chips, Clay’s is now in its second incarnation, this time in a suburb of Reading north of the town centre. If you take the train to Reading, you can walk to Clay’s in 10-15 minutes, through the park and over Caversham bridge, which at the moment has a Hitchcockian number of ducks, geese and swans milling about, which is wonderful, although ornithophobics may prefer to take a cab. Either way, you cannot miss Clay’s: it was once a <a href="https://www.jdwetherspoon.com/">Wetherspoon’s</a>, ergo it is enormous, and the front is now painted <a href="https://www.jdwetherspoon.com/">TeleTubbies</a> Laa-Laa-yellow with Royal Mail-red lettering.

A big deal too when his favourite daughter, Cordelia, effectively rules herself out of inheriting. Bigger still when the other two, Goneril and Regan, make him unwelcome in his own land. It is the enormity of these events, the outrage of a monarch being disrespected and undermined, that explains his exile and madness.</p><p>Although there is much fury in Kayleigh Hawkins’ staging for Her Productions, Unseemly Women and Girl Gang Manchester, there is too little sense of order being disrupted.

<p>Ecodomes, poolside lounging and meditation feature at these gorgeous retreats in the UK and sunny southern Europe</p><p>I’ve just returned from the most relaxing weekend at <a href="https://www.purusharetreats.com/">Purusha Retreats</a>, south of Lincoln. From the moment we headed up the grassy, tree-lined driveway we knew we’d arrived in relaxation heaven. Set in a countryside location, we slept in private ecodomes, each with hammocks, a wood-fired hot tub, a private shower and compost loo. Eco-friendly toiletries are provided. Each dome is set apart from the others for complete privacy. The communal spaces are equally beautiful, set around a small lake. Walks are marked around the site. Mornings are a joy of birdsong and evenings are delightful under the stars.<br /><strong>Clare Foyle</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/jun/09/readers-favourite-welness-retreats-in-the-uk-and-europe">Continue reading...</a>

Therapists examine the truths and myths of relationship lore</p><p><strong>TRUE</strong> “For most people, a satisfying sexual relationship is an important part of a good relationship,” says Susanna Abse, psychoanalytic therapist and author of Tell Me the Truth About Love: 13 Tales from Couple Therapy. “While sex may not be <em>the</em> most important thing, it’s certainly an indicator of chemistry, and it matters – especially at the start. Also, if you’re having bad sex with someone in the beginning, why would you want to carry on?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/09/therapists-reveal-20-truths-and-myths-about-relationships">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The flowers are fabulous, the plants surprisingly hardy, but I’ve donated mine to a friend who has larger beds</p><p>When I found out I was moving to a flat with a garden of its own – the first I had access to as an adult – I celebrated by ordering bare-root peonies, variety <a href="https://www.rhsplants.co.uk/plants/_/paeonia-coral-charm/classid.2000002107/" title="">‘Coral Charm’</a>. This was in July.

<p>It may be a small sample size but statistics from the Premier League season suggest Italian side could have a formation to frustrate City</p><p>Inter’s deployment of a front two is not an unknown issue for Manchester City to combat but it is an unfamiliar one. Lautaro Martínez has spells when he cannot score – as happened in the World Cup – but when he is hot he is hot, and he has scored 11 times in his past 13 games. He will probably be partnered by Edin Dzeko, now 37 but still an effective, intelligent and underrated target man.

They snog passionately and the audience cheer. To see this soft, sexy moment between these two older women feels remarkably rare and somehow affirming; look, this play says, this is the joy you can have. This is what commitment can look like.</p><p>Jennifer Lunn’s play knocks at the door of Liz Crowther’s spritely Es and Doreene Blackstock’s protective Flo. The pair have stood side by side for 40 years, from the community chaos of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/greenham">Greenham Common</a> to the happy haven of the home they’ve shared and shaped together (delicately designed by Libby Watson). But as Es starts showing symptoms of dementia, everything they’ve built together begins to unravel. Having hidden their relationship from her family and never officially married, everything is in Es’s name; Flo could be swept aside with no control over her partner’s future care.</p><p>At <a href="https://kilntheatre.com/whats-on/es-flo/">Kiln theatre</a> until 24 June</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/09/es-flo-review-devoted-couple-contend-with-the-brutality-of-dementia">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I may loathe poor Bill Thompson – but our joyful, creative children’s telly is one thing this country can still be proud of</p><p>There’s a character on Postman Pat that I hate, passionately. <a href="https://postmanpat.fandom.com/wiki/Bill_Thompson">Bill Thompson</a>, the child of Alf and Dorothy, is a snarky little sod with an attitude problem. There’s a part in an episode about a treasure hunt, where he says “I’d be finished by now if I didn’t have to wait for you slowcoaches”, which invokes in me an almost physical loathing. Even the Postman Pat fandom page <a href="https://postmanpat.fandom.com/wiki/Bill_Thompson">describes him as “conceited”</a>. I’ve spent so much time watching Postman Pat with my baby that I’ve conjured up Succession-worthy backstories to explain Bill<strong>’</strong>s flawed personality – is it the pressure of being promised his dad Alf’s farm from an early age?</p><p>This is what happens with children’s television, once you become a parent and suddenly find yourself watching it. You know you’re watching something created for children, but you cannot help but impose onto it an adult sensibility. For example, people often remark that Postman Pat is objectively a terrible postman – always losing the thing he is supposed to be delivering. I counter that since Royal Mail privatisation and the transformation of his role into “special delivery”, he is probably on a zero-hours contract, not to mention constantly being asked to do things, such as flying a helicopter or catching a pony, that are well beyond a usual postman’s duties. My father, when visiting, pointed out that Pat being constantly tracked on an app by Ben in the office is an accurate portrayal of the kind of surveillance capitalism many workers are now forced to contend with.</p><p>Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist and author</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/09/postman-pat-character-british-children-tv">Continue reading...</a>

I started studying magic as a teenager and worked as a magician as an adult. I mainly did tricks using cards, coins and everyday objects. In 2015, I was making magic props with a glass plate when it shattered. I fractured my little finger on my right hand, and the tendon on my index finger was severed. I lost dexterity in that hand and realised that my career as a magician could not continue.</p><p>That’s when I started stacking cards, without glue, tape or tools, as therapy to recover movement in my hand.

## Why dressing for dinner out is my favourite kind of look | Jess Cartner-Morley on fashion

<p>Above-the-table dressing doesn’t just mean a fun top and boring trousers. You can aim for something special without leaving your comfort zone</p><p>Going out for dinner is my favourite thing to get dressed for. It is also an under-curated outfit category. Going out to eat is a much more regular occurrence, for most grownups, than going to a wedding or to a fancy party, but we spend a lot more time talking about wedding-guest outfits and party dresses than we do about what to wear to a restaurant.</p><p>I don’t think it’s because what we wear to go out isn’t a big deal – restaurants are expensive, and dinner out is a big treat for most of us. You are investing a substantial amount of money, and probably most of your Friday night, in this occasion. But there is no dress code, so it doesn’t feel stressful, which I guess is why we don’t feel the need to plan it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jun/09/why-dressing-for-dinner-out-is-my-favourite-kind-of-look">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Smithsonian Folkways)</strong><br />The Bosnian musician combines Slavic sevdah, Sephardic Jewish and original songs to tell the story of two soldiers who fall in love during the first world war</p><p>After an adolescence sheltering from the siege of Sarajevo in the Bosnian war, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/may/18/damir-imamovic-sarajevo-bosnian-singer-sevdah">Damir Imamović</a> dedicated his musical life to researching, performing and making accessible the sevdalinka (AKA sevdah) of his childhood. These emotional southern Slavic songs of loss, love and longing find a fascinating new home on his eighth album. Written as a companion piece to his friend Aleksandar Hemon’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/26/the-world-and-all-that-it-holds-by-aleksandar-hemon-review-an-engrossing-epic">novel of the same name</a>, it amplifies the story of two male Bosnian soldiers, one Muslim, one Jewish, who fall in love during the first world war.<br /><br />Imamović combines sevdalinka with Sephardic Jewish songs and intricately written originals to reflect how these characters sing to each other. Centuries-old ballads crackle with urgent emotions. In the 15th-century Anderleto, Imamović’s playing of his Persian lute, pressing and tingling, frames a tale of adultery in a magical balance of beauty and dread.</p><p>Snijeg Pade (The Snow Has Fallen), a folk song about the unfairness of a forced, loveless marriage, packs a different, dirge-like, grungy power: after Imamović performed it at Pride in Sarajevo in 2019, the LGBTQ+ movement in the Balkans adopted it as an unofficial anthem. Imamović rewrites the last two verses of Teško Je Ljubit Tajno (It’s Hard to Love in Secret) to create a triumphant narrative for the male protagonists, too. One cannot tell his late mother about his love, but the other is urged to: “Tell yours / For together we will win.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/09/damir-imamovic-the-world-and-all-that-it-holds-review">Continue reading...</a>

Unbeknown to her and her friends, there was musical entertainment: a band from London no one had heard of. She suspects the group had just phoned up and asked if they could play. “They were so bad,” she says. “We were dancing, having a good laugh. We thought they were a piss-take of a 60s band. Someone said they saw the drummer afterwards and he was crying because they were so terrible.”</p><p>Afterwards, the singer came over and asked Bradley about her clothes: “If I dressed like that all the time. I’d had a difficult childhood and I think I expressed that through my clothes. I’d butchered my hair: I’d tried to use henna and peroxide and it came out wrong – bright orange. I was wearing ripped fishnets and a holey jumper. I had 11 ear piercings.

What nonsense.” While I appreciate the opportunity to engage in a discussion about the future of European football, I must express my strong disagreement with Marshall’s assertions. It is imperative to set the record straight and shed light on the true nature of ECA’s actions and the distortions it has caused within the football landscape.</p><p>Marshall accuses me of promoting a false narrative regarding the ECA’s influence on Uefa. However, the truth is that the ECA has been gradually orchestrating a silent coup within the European football governance structure. This slow-moving coup is designed to empower the continent’s largest clubs, enabling them to exert greater control over the sport. Marshall conveniently highlights various clubs in his article, without recognising that they are, in fact, the dominant forces within their respective countries. The financial windfall from European competitions has led to significant distortions within their domestic leagues.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jun/09/european-club-association-silent-football-coup-javier-tebas">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Champions League glory is within the grasp of this team of well-heeled superstars. But I remember when football was an actual competition</p><p>On Saturday 11 October 1975, my dad took me to my first ever football match: Aston Villa (hooray!) against Tottenham Hotspur (boo!). I would be lying if I were to claim that I could remember much of the game now. I was so captivated by the spectacle, and particularly the unimaginable noise of 50,000 people shouting vaguely in unison, that I spent much of the time looking anywhere but the pitch. <br /><br />That day marked the start of a ritual for the two of us that would endure until I left home at 18. Every other Saturday Dad would drive us to the ground from our home in Nottingham, with the radio tuned to Birmingham’s commercial station, BRMB, which always had a more partisan, Villa-centric take on sports reporting than the BBC. <br /><br />Upon walking the final mile to Villa Park, we’d head first to the club car park, where the players and managers of both sides would each have to fight off an army of hangers-on, pre-teen autograph hunters and – once – gangland enforcers apparently looking to collect a debt from a player. Andy Gray, Brian Little, Martin Peters, Alan Hudson, Bobby Robson … reader, you may not know them, but I harassed them all, and still have the written evidence.</p><p>And what a time to become obsessed with football, and Villa in particular.

<p>Prince Harry became one of the most senior royals ever to give evidence in an English court this week. Jim Waterson reports from the high court in London where tabloid phone hacking was back under the microscope</p><p>For Prince Harry’s entire life, he has been the subject of media stories and of special interest to tabloid newspapers. Everything from childhood injuries to his early relationships, his entry to and exit from a military career right up to his marriage and subsequent departure from official royal life. Many of those stories were written, he claims, with the aid of illegal practices such as phone hacking.</p><p>As <strong>Jim Waterson </strong>tells <strong>Nosheen Iqbal</strong>, Harry is also suing the publishers of the Sun and the Daily Mail, but this week he got his day in court against the Mirror group. Under cross examination, he made his case that reporters seemingly had access to information that could only have come from underhand methods. The Mirror group has admitted to hacking phones in the past but maintains that Harry’s was not one of them. Their case is that the information they printed was from sources close to the prince or already in the public domain.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/jun/09/prince-harry-versus-the-mirror-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
