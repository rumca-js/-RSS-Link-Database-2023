Gorgeous visuals, interesting glimpses of how characters and relationships will be changed in this new and rebooted universe, a deep dive into the new Kameo fighters system- the gameplay reveal was packed with all of this information and more. Here, we\u2019re going to go through those details.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djGr_yMAypQ", "date_published": "2023-06-09 16:00:22+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Can the Alone in the Dark Reboot Bring the Franchise BACK FROM THE DEAD?", "description": "All things considered, Alone in the Dark looks like a promising reimagining of the influential survival horror classic. There are some rough edges here and there, but by and large - Alone in the Dark is looking to be on the right track. We have some really high hopes for this project and the game seems really focused to not only bring back fans of the original but also introduce the franchise to a modern audience. \n\nAs it stands, the fate of this franchise belongs in the hands of this revival - and we genuinely hope that the beloved IP finds a new life amongst the modern horror staples on the market.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xab8iMLFBKo", "date_published": "2023-06-09 14:00:44+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "14 BIGGEST Announcements At Summer Game Fest 2023", "description": "Summer Game Fest 2023 had a ton of new announcements.
