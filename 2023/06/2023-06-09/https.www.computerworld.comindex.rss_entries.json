Though before the iPod arrived, the market didn\u2019t care much for digital music players, and before the iPhone, people didn\u2019t care much for screen-based phones. So this should be familiar territory for Apple.</p><p>The iPod and the iPhone were both Steve Jobs-launched products \u2014 and after Jobs, you must stretch to find similar success, let alone a break-out product like the iPod and iPhone. The iPad seemed to lose momentum after Jobs died in 2011, and the Apple Watch (which broke Jobs\u2019 naming convention but was a very good device) didn\u2019t quite match those earlier iconic devices. (The internal decision to marry the Apple Watch to only the iPhone severely limited its potential market.)</p><p class=\"jumpTag\"><a href=\"https://www.computerworld.com/article/3699112/apple-s-vision-pro-can-it-leap-the-headset-wearing-hurdle.html#jump\">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>", "link": "https://www.computerworld.com/article/3699112/apple-s-vision-pro-can-it-leap-the-headset-wearing-hurdle.html#tk.rss_all", "date_published": "2023-06-09 10:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.computerworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Handy Outlook keyboard shortcuts for Windows and Mac", "description": "<article>\n\t<section class=\"page\">\n<p>Outlook\u2019s Ribbon interface is great for finding everything you might ever want to do in the email, contacts, and calendaring program \u2014 particularly things you don\u2019t do frequently, like using the mail merge feature.</p><p>But if you\u2019re looking to do common tasks fast, you\u2019ll find keyboard shortcuts far more useful.
