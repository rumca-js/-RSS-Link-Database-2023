The only highlight in that garbage-time effort was Haslem blowing past Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to become the oldest to participate in the NBA finals at 42 years and 363 days. And with Heat legend’s retirement looming after the buzzer sounds on this series, well, he damn sure isn’t about to go out like <em>that</em>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/09/udonis-haslem-miami-heat-oldest-player-nba-finals">Continue reading...</a>

Seventy years ago this week, the SCG was packed out for the visit of the American All Stars, a team of college football players who had no knowledge of rugby league just a month before.</p><p>Three days later, to mark the Queen’s coronation, another 32,554 fans attended the SCG to watch the Americans score 41 points against a New South Wales side featuring Clive Churchill, Keith Holman, Noel Pidding and Harry Wells, courtesy of a generous display of defending and refereeing (albeit the Blues heaped on 62 points themselves). American half-back Gary Kerkorian, a Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback the previous season, scored all 13 of his kicks at goal that week. The future looked exhilarating.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/no-helmets-required/2023/jun/09/rugby-league-us-touring-heroes-big-fights-nrl-visits">Continue reading...</a>

Ask any of the 100,000-odd people embarking on their annual pilgrimage to the spiritual home of metal, and they’ll jokingly tell you the road to Donington Park doesn’t feel much shorter. Born from the ashes of the Monsters of Rock one-dayers, recalibrated for rock’s burgeoning new generation and christened with a suitably edgy name that would most definitely never age badly, the Download festival has, since 2003, established itself as the beating heart of a scene with the volume turned up to 11. With the festival this weekend <a href="https://downloadfestival.co.uk/" title="">marking its 20th anniversary</a> with its biggest event yet, the story of its rise is one of community, circle pits and an inordinate amount of urine in bottles …</p><p><strong>Stuart Galbraith</strong><strong> (</strong><strong>founder of Download &amp; CEO of promoters Kilimanjaro Live</strong><strong>)</strong> In the early 2000s, there were whole new genres of rock coming through.

<p>Don’t be fooled: supermarkets do not necessarily offer the best value when it comes to wine</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/02/good-value-roses-for-outdoor-drinking-fiona-beckett">As I said last week</a>, price is not the same as value. Just because supermarkets have a monopoly on sub-£7 wines doesn’t mean they are cheapest for everything. Rather, they rely on us believing that everything we buy from them is keenly priced, when in reality it may well not be, especially if it’s not on promotion and involves a famous name. Supermarkets are generally not so good at providing less well-known alternatives that offer better value.</p><p>I was reminded of this the other day at a tasting put on by the very smart wine merchant <a href="https://www.hhandc.co.uk/">Haynes, Hanson &amp; Clark</a> (with that name, they could easily be a firm of solicitors, couldn’t they?), which has branches in Chelsea and Stow-on-the-Wold in the Cotswolds. Unaffordable? Surprisingly not. For example, they have a fantastic selection of clarets, starting with the smartly bottled <a href="https://www.hhandc.co.uk/all-wines/2019-chateau-frontenac-bordeaux-superieur/">Château Frontenac Bordeaux Supérieur 2019</a> (14.5%) at £10.95 a bottle (or £58.20, or £9.70 a bottle, for a case of six). And it would be so much better to buy their <a href="https://www.hhandc.co.uk/all-wines/2019-chateau-faure-beausejour-fronsac/">Faure-Beausejour 2019</a>, a fleshy, ripe, merlot-dominated fronsac at £12.35 (or £65.70 by the half-case), than most of the indifferent Saint-Émilions you find on supermarket shelves. (Incidentally, supermarkets do score when they go off-piste in this way, too: Tesco, for instance, has an absolutely cracking, bordeaux-like bergerac right now called <a href="https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/314424531">Eglise Saint Jacques</a> (13%) for just £6.50.

We meet the sceptics who hired a private investigator because they did not believe Megan was actually unwell, only to be baffled by her sudden death.

## Faith, Hope and Carnage by Nick Cave and Seán O’Hagan review – heartfelt conversations

<p>The Australian singer-songwriter is candid and charismatic in these in-depth discussions about art, music, life and loss</p><p>Faith, Hope and Carnage is built around a series of telephone exchanges in lockdown in 2020 between the musician <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/nick-cave">Nick Cave</a> and the journalist Seán O’Hagan. These conversations were later transcribed and arranged as an extended Q&amp;A, and a memoir of sorts, in which Cave reflects on art, music, religion, death, his childhood in Australia and his hell-raising early adulthood.</p><p>The audiobook, then, is the project come full circle, with Cave and O’Hagan narrating the text of their conversations. If O’Hagan’s delivery is a little flat at times, it is not a problem that afflicts Cave, who is heartfelt, charismatic and sage-like, even when tackling the most difficult of topics. Threaded through the chapters is his teenage son, Arthur, who died after falling from a cliff in 2015, and the “transformative” impact his death had on Cave. In the months following the accident, he was sent into “a chaos that was also kind of an incapacitation”, though he has since channelled his grief into a new and more empathetic way of being. In 2018, Cave launched <a href="https://www.theredhandfiles.com/">The Red Hand Files</a>, a website where he invites people to “ask me anything”. It’s a concept the once publicity-averse singer would previously have found unthinkable, though now he sees human connection and candour as crucial to his ability to carry on.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/09/faith-hope-and-carnage-by-nick-cave-and-sean-ohagan-review-heartfelt-conversations">Continue reading...</a>

Having fought in many wars over the centuries, Sir Kay knows the drill. But when he wakes in a 21st-century Britain ravaged by the climate crisis and social unrest, it’s hard to identify the enemy. After rescuing a young woman fleeing from armed guards near a blazing fracking facility, he allies himself with feminist eco-terrorists trying to save the planet. The appearance of a fire-breathing dragon suggests somebody is messing around with magic, and he has a duty to stop them. Humorous fantasy based on magical mishaps may not be a comfortable fit with the grim vision of a very near future in which half of England is underwater, but it works. This audacious, original debut is angry as well as entertaining, and an exciting new take on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter_of_Britain">Matter of Britain</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/09/the-best-recent-science-fiction-fantasy-and-horror-reviews-roundup">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After more than a decade of 80-hour working weeks, the member for Brighton Pavilion is standing down. What has she achieved as the only Green in the Commons? And does that feel like failure or success?</p><p>In the garden of a cafe in the middle of her Brighton Pavilion constituency, Caroline Lucas is eight hours into her bombshell day: the country’s only Green MP has just announced that she won’t stand again for election. She went from a squeaky, 1,200, didn’t-see-that-coming majority in 2010 to a don’t-bother-counting-them almost 20,000 majority in 2019, and has ascended to that very rare status with many of her constituents: it doesn’t matter whether or not you agree with her, you vote for her anyway. It would be rude not to: she works so hard and makes so much sense.</p><p>She has the very short hair of a person who doesn’t have time for hair, estimates that she works “75 or 80 hours a week” and looks harried but undefeated. I already knew she wasn’t going to stand again, obviously – that’s why I’m here. But I still can’t quite believe it, and keep opening my mouth to start a question that turns out to be nothing but “but”: “But you’re an institution … But your constituents love you … But you actually make things happen; who else is going to do that? … But there’s so much still to do.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/09/parliament-always-felt-like-a-nightmare-caroline-lucas-on-life-as-a-green-mp-and-what-shell-do-next">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Because Music)</strong><br />A howl of despair sublimated into beautiful experimental pop, the artist’s fourth album is his best yet</p><p>When <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/christine-and-the-queens">Christine and the Queens</a> first appeared in the anglophone world in 2015, the name was an alias for Héloïse Letissier: a French artist with an extraordinary line in immaculately cool, obliquely catchy, 80s-flavoured synthpop that mused on queer identity. By 2018, Letissier had become Chris – the eponymous, androgynous protagonist of her funky second album. Then, last year, the musician announced he was now using male pronouns as well as another moniker: Redcar, also the title character of his third album, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/10/christine-and-the-queens-redcar-les-adorables-etoiles-review-clouds-of-sorrow-from-the-artists-new-persona">Redcar les Adorables Étoiles</a>.</p><p>That record, a reflective, slippery, not-quite-satisfying collection sung in French, was met with a muted reception. Now it seems simply a warmup for this masterpiece. Letissier’s clearly rocky path to self-realisation has been entangled with seismic grief – in 2019, his mother died – and Paranoïa, Angels, True Love is a howl of despair sublimated into astonishingly beautiful experimental pop, drenched in warm celestial light, punctured by spikes of confused pain. On Tears Can Be So Soft, loss is bluntly aired – “I miss my mama at night” – over a syncopated raindrops-on-the-roof beat and a minuscule snippet of Marvin Gaye. A distorted “fucking” is bellowed over sweet Johann Pachelbel strings on Full of Life. True Love couches romance in inescapable grief (“make me forget my mother”), the sound of a heart monitor and blasts of static.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/09/christine-and-the-queens-paranoia-angels-true-love-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A wave of new restrictions on gender-affirming care for minors relies on a number of doctors with ties to rightwing groups and little experience treating transgender patients</p><p>On Wednesday, the governor of Missouri, Mike Parson, signed legislation to restrict gender-affirming care for minors, becoming the 20th US state in a nationwide wave targeting transgender healthcare.</p><p>To promote their legislation, Republican politicians have turned to a handful of controversial doctors, all of whom have ties to rightwing groups and little experience treating transgender patients. Every major medical association in the country has come out against such bans, stating that gender-affirming care should be available to those who need it, including minors.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/09/doctor-republican-trans-gender-affirming-minor-healthcare-lgbtq-rights">Continue reading...</a>

## A great ridge walk to a fine old pub: The Pheasant, Tattenhall, Cheshire

<p>With views of distant hills this walk high on Sandstone Ridge takes in castles and a brilliant hostelry</p><p>The view from the terrace outside the Pheasant pub stretches west across miles of russet, green and gold. I am deep in rural Cheshire, roughly halfway between Crewe and Chester. The pub sits high on the <a href="https://sandstonetrail.co.uk/geology-of-the-sandstone-trail/" title="">Sandstone Ridge</a>, a distinctive feature in an otherwise level landscape – one that is being considered for an area of outstanding natural beauty status (AONB) by <a href="https://www.sandstoneridge.org.uk/news/aonb-update.html" title="">Natural England</a>. The <a href="https://sandstonetrail.co.uk/" title="">Sandstone Trail</a> runs past the pub, on its way from the market town of Frodsham on the Mersey estuary south to Whitchurch in north Shropshire. Two of the trail’s most impressive castles are close to the pub, linked by a five-mile ramble from the door.</p><p>I set off around midday along country lanes, past old ivy-covered barns and mossy walls sprouting ferns. A cobbled track takes me under a stone archway, flanked by silver birches and bronzed oaks, bright holly trees and conifers. Coming out of the woods, huge views appear ahead. I am looking eastwards now across gently sloping wintry fields to the village of Bunbury.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/jun/09/a-great-ridge-walk-to-a-fine-old-pub-the-pheasant-tattenhall-cheshire">Continue reading...</a>

It was his most explosive yet.</p><p>Dressed in a khaki sweatshirt and trousers, in the middle of a forest in a Wagner training camp, Prigozhin, the commander of an army of contract fighters known as the Wagner group, accuses the Russian army of lying about events in the <a href="https://meduza.io/en/news/2023/05/23/russia-announces-defeat-of-pro-ukrainian-fighters-in-belgorod-region-saying-70-invaders-were-killed">Belgorod</a> region – where anti-Putin Russian partisans have been conducting cross-border raids from Ukraine since late May – and warns of the risk of civil war.<strong> </strong>He calls for the Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu to be put on trial for facilitating “the genocide of the Russian population” by being totally unprepared for the war in Ukraine, and more than once suggests that Shoigu and other senior military command should be shot. Prigozhin also claims that inhabitants of the Belgorod region have been writing to him, suggesting a Chile-type solution. “Chile means Pinochet,” explains Prigozhin. “… The Russian elite <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jun/28/pinochet.chile">in a stadium</a> surrounded by armed men with machine guns.”</p><p>Samantha de Bendern is an associate fellow at international affairs thinktank Chatham House</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/09/russian-armed-forces-infighting-yevgeny-prigozhin">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Choose your words carefully with France’s most brilliant – and formidable – film director, as she discusses being bourgeois, Harvey Weinstein, and her latest movie, Stars at Noon</p><p>My first glimpse of Claire Denis is of a slight, elegant figure dressed in white slipping out of a black limousine that fills the narrow street outside the hotel where our rendezvous is scheduled. For an instant, I feel as if I have been sucked into the menacing world of her latest film. I have just travelled to Paris to interview her, and have arrived early because I am anxious not to waste a minute of the 45 I have been granted to investigate the extraordinary career of a French director idolised by peers such as Barry Jenkins, Charlotte Wells, Andrea Arnold and Pedro Almodóvar and whose work is a fixture of critics’ lists of the best movies ever made.</p><p>At <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/interview/interviewpages/0,,338784,00.html" title="">77, Denis</a> is a formidable presence. She speaks a handful of languages and made two films during the Covid pandemic, both of which won European film festival awards last year. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/12/fire-or-both-sides-of-the-blade-review-claire-denis-many-faced-love-story" title="">Both Sides of the Blade</a> took the Silver Bear at Berlin, while <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/26/stars-at-noon-review-benny-safdie-claire-denis-drama-nicaraguan" title="">Stars at Noon</a> – the film we are here to discuss – tied for the Grand Prix at Cannes. Based on an early, semi-autobiographical novel by the poet and novelist Denis Johnson, it’s the story of a reckless young American woman trapped in Nicaragua who tries to flee the country in a stolen car with her English lover (Joe Alwyn), a mysterious character she has randomly picked up. He claims to be a businessman but keeps a gun in his sponge bag and appears to be wanted by the CIA.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/09/claire-denis-france-film-director-stars-at-noon-interview">Continue reading...</a>
