In Jedi: Survivor, the Crossguard lightsaber stance is the equivalent to wielding a massive two-handed sword - and it makes sense that a giant chunk of metal would be heavier, but why would a lightsaber be harder to wield because of itâ€™s blade configuration? Well, short answer, because itâ€™s not real, duh, but we still asked game director Stig Asmussen to explain the logic for Calâ€™s changed movement while using this stance in combat.
