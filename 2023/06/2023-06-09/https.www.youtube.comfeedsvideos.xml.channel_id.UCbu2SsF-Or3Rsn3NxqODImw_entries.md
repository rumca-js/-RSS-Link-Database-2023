Get a glimpse of a short gameplay clip that was shown off during Summer Game Fest featuring Saga Anderson from Alan Wake 2. 

A string of ritualistic murders have brought FBI agent and profiler Saga Anderson and her partner and fellow agent Alex Casey to the small town of Bright Falls in the Pacific Northwest.

The gameplay in this video takes place early in the game. Saga's investigation has turned into a nightmare after finding pages of a horror story that start to come true, perhaps written by a certain missing writer.

The nightmare becomes real as Saga finds herself at Cauldron Lake, outside of Bright Falls, trying to track down and stop the murder victim who has come back from the dead and turned into a monster.

Alan Wake 2 comes out October 17th 2023 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.

The WILDS await in Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter 4 Season 3.

The center of the Island has collapsed, revealing a vast, hidden jungle with ancient secrets to discover. Ascend to canopies, ride raptors, and slide in the mud for speed and camouflage. Detect enemies with the Thermal DMR, skid on vines while firing the FlapJack Rifle, or transform opponents into spectators with the Cybertron Cannon.

With WILDS things have gotten a little... wild. Navigate around the map to discover new forms of life such as the Bomb Flower, Stink Flower, Slurp Plants, and more! Plus there’s plenty of exciting new POI’s to be found on your journey. But don't forget your weapons. Danger is ever-present and you may want to hold onto the Kinetic Boomerang or maybe even a Wildwasp Jar! 

A good exploration starts with great explorers. This season’s Battle Pass includes all new Outfits, Emotes, Pickaxes, and more to point you in the right direction.
