In an AMA (Ask Me Anything) discussion, Huffman promised improvements to Reddit\u2019s own app, but seemed unwilling to make concessions on pricing and other issues that have rankled the community.</p><p>\u201cReddit needs to be a self-sustaining business, and to do that, we can no longer subsidize commercial entities that require large-scale data use,\u201d he wrote in his AMA post. \u201cSome apps such as Apollo, Reddit is Fun, and Sync have decided this pricing doesn\u2019t work for their businesses and will close before pricing goes into effect.\u201d</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>In a series of mostly 1-2 sentence responses to detailed, multi-part questions, Huffman acknowledged some missteps in the company\u2019s API rollout, but largely declined to tackle thornier questions about the company\u2019s handling of its relationship with third-party developers. In <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/comment/jnk8m0z/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\"><ins>one response</ins></a>, he conceded that the 30-day window given to developers for the new API was a \u201ctight timeline\u201d and said the company was \u201ccontinuing to chat with many of the developers who still want to work with us.\u201d</p><p>But other developers soon weighed in, noting that they had never heard back from the company, despite reaching out through the channels promoted by Reddit. \u201cI have been trying to contact Reddit over the last 3 months and have been completely ignored,\u201d one developer <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/comment/jnkd694/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\"><ins>wrote</ins></a>. \u201cI feel completely powerless to do anything right now and I want to try and save the app I've been working on for the last 10 years.\u201d Huffman apologized and said the company would respond.</p><p>When asked about why the company accused Christian Selig, the developer of Apollo, of threatening the company \u2014 a claim Selig denied and promptly debunked with an audio clip of a phone call with a Reddit rep \u2014 Huffman <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/comment/jnk45rr/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\"><ins>doubled down</ins></a> on the criticism. \u201cHis \u2018joke\u2019 is the least of our issues,\u201d he said.  \u201cHis behavior and communications with us has been all over the place\u2014saying one thing to us while saying something completely different. I don\u2019t know how we could do business with him.\u201d (Huffman didn\u2019t respond to a followup question from Selig asking for examples of such behavior.)</p><p>Huffman, who goes by spez on the platform, also promised that Reddit was working on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/comment/jnkccq7/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\"><ins>improvements</ins></a> to its own app, including its <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/comment/jnkhdk8/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\"><ins>moderation</ins></a> tools and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/reddit-says-some-accessibility-apps-wont-have-to-pay-for-its-api-213401412.html\"><ins>accessibility</ins></a> features. Both areas are often cited by Redditors who prefer third-party apps to the company\u2019s native app. He also said that the reason why third-party apps would no longer be able to show sexually explicit content was due to a changing \u201cregulatory environment\u201d and legal concerns. \u201cIt\u2019s a constant fight to keep this content at all,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/comment/jnk27g1/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\"><ins>said</ins></a>. \u201cWe have to be strict / conservative about where it shows up.\u201d</p><p>One of his most telling answers came in <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/comment/jnk2817/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\"><ins>response</ins></a> to a question about the perception that \u201cReddit has become increasingly profit-driven and less focused on community engagement\u201d than it has in the past. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to be profit-driven until profits arrive,\u201d Huffman responded. \u201cUnlike some of the 3P [third-party] apps, we are not profitable.\u201d</p><p>Notably, there were a number of topics Huffman didn't address, including why the company priced its API at a rate that developers say is prohibitively expensive. Huffman also didn\u2019t address the upcoming blackout from thousands of subreddits protesting the API changes. More than <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/reddit-ceo-will-host-an-ama-on-api-changes-as-thousands-of-subreddits-plan-to-go-dark-193423226.html\"><ins>3,000 subreddits</ins></a> have pledged to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/reddit-communities-are-going-dark-to-protest-changes-that-would-hurt-third-party-apps-154133342.html\"><ins>\u201cgo dark\u201d</ins></a> for two days beginning June 12th to protest the changes.</p><p>By the end of the AMA, Huffman had responded to 14 questions, while a few other executives answered a handful of their own. In perhaps the most telling sign that their answers were not well-received, every answer from the reddit team was downvoted so heavily they were almost impossible to view within the AMA thread itself. A moderator later linked all of their answers at the top of the thread. \u201cWe know answers are tough to find,\u201d they said.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/reddit-ceo-steve-huffman-defends-api-changes-in-ama-202924631.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/reddit-ceo-steve-huffman-defends-api-changes-in-ama-202924631.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-09 20:29:24+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "DOJ charges Russian nationals with laundering bitcoin in 2011 Mt.

That\u2019s not a particularly big ask given the fundamentally interactive nature of gaming, \u201cPlayers are incredibly forgiving as long as the virtual humans do not make any glaring mistakes,\u201d Rabin continued. \u201cPlayers simply need the right clues and suggestions for them to share and fully participate in the deception.\u201d</p><h2>Early days</h2><p>Take <em>Space Invaders</em> and <em>Pac-Mac</em>, for example. In <em>Space Invaders</em>, the falling enemies remained steadfast on their zig-zag path towards Earth\u2019s annihilation, regardless of the player\u2019s actions, with the only change coming as a speed increase when they got close enough to the ground. There was no enemy intelligence to speak of, only the player\u2019s skill in leading targets would carry the day. <em>Pac-Man,</em> on the other hand, used enemy interactions as a tentpost of gameplay.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, the Ghost Gang will coordinate to track and trap The Pac \u2014 unless the player gobbled up a Power Pellet before vengefully hunting down Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde. That simple, two-state behavior, essentially a fancy if-then statement in C, proved revolutionary for the nascent gaming industry and became a de facto method of programming NPC reactions for years to come using finite-state machines (FSMs).</p><h2>Finite-state machines</h2><p>A <a href=\"https://mark-truluck.medium.com/the-machine-in-the-ghost-46f856f94ed2\">finite-state machine</a> is a mathematical model that abstracts a theoretical \u201cmachine\u201d capable of existing in any number of states \u2014 ally/enemy, alive/dead, red/green/blue/yellow/black \u2014 but occupying exclusively one state at a time. It consists, \u201cof a set of states and a set of transitions making it possible to go from one state to another one,\u201d Viktor Lundstrom wrote in 2016\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1081060/FULLTEXT01.pdf\"><em>Human-like decision making for bots in mobile gaming</em></a>. \u201cA transition connects two states but only one way so that if the FSM is in a state that can transit to another state, it will do so if the transition requirements are met. Those requirements can be internal like how much health a character has, or it can be external like how big of a threat it is facing.\u201d</p><p>Like light switches in <em>Half-Life</em> and <em>Fallout, </em>or the electric generators in <em>Dead Island</em>: FSM\u2019s are either on or they\u2019re off or they\u2019re in a rigidly defined alternative state (real world examples would include a traffic light or your kitchen microwave). These machines can transition back and forth between states given the player\u2019s actions but half measures like dimmer switches and low power modes do not exist in these universes. There are few limits on the number of states that an FSM can exist in beyond the logistical challenges of programming and maintaining them all, <a href=\"https://mark-truluck.medium.com/the-machine-in-the-ghost-46f856f94ed2\">as you can see with the Ghost Gang\u2019s behavioral flowcharts</a> on Jared Mitchell\u2019s blog post, <a href=\"https://jaredemitchell.com/ai-examples/\"><em>AI Programming Examples</em></a>. Lundstrom points out that FSM, \u201coffers lots of flexibility but has the downside of producing a lot of method calls\u201d which tie up additional system resources.</p><h2>Decision and behavior trees</h2><p>Alternately, game AIs can be modeled using decision trees. \u201cThere are usually no logical checks such as AND or OR because they are implicitly defined by the tree itself,\u201d Lundstrom wrote, noting that the trees \u201ccan be built in a non-binary fashion making each decision have more than two possible outcomes.\u201d</p><p>Behavior trees are a logical step above that and offer players contextual actions to take by chaining multiple smaller decision actions together. For example, if the character is faced with the task of passing through a closed door, they can either perform the action to turn the handle to open it or, upon finding the door locked, take the \u201ccomposite action\u201d of pulling a crowbar from inventory and breaking the locking mechanism.</p><p>\u201cBehavior trees use what is called a reactive design where the AI tends to try things and makes its decisions from things it has gotten signals from,\u201d Lundstrom explained. \u201cThis is good for fast phasing games where situations change quite often. On the other hand, this is bad in more strategic games where many moves should be planned into the future without real feedback.\u201d</p><h2>GOAPs and RadiantAI</h2><p>From behavior trees grew GOAPs (Goal-Oriented Action Planners), which we first saw in 2005\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F.E.A.R._(video_game)\"><em>F.E.A.R.</em></a>  An AI agent empowered with GOAP will use the actions available to choose from any number of goals to work towards, which have been prioritized based on environmental factors. \u201cThis prioritization can in real-time be changed if as an example the goal of being healthy increases in priority when the health goes down,\u201d Lundstrom wrote. He asserts that they are \u201ca step in the right direction\u201d but suffers the drawback that \u201cit is harder to understand conceptually and implement, especially when bot behaviors come from emergent properties.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Radiant_A.I.\">Radiant AI</a>, which Bethesda developed first for <em>Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em> and then adapted to <em>Skyrim, Fallout 3, Fallout 4 and Fallout: New Vegas, </em>operates on a similar principle to GOAP. Whereas NPCs in <em>Oblivion</em> were only programmed with five or six set actions, resulting in highly predictable behaviors, by <em>Skyrim</em>, those behaviors had expanded to location-specific sets, so that NPCs working in mines and lumber yards wouldn\u2019t mirror the movements of folks in town. What\u2019s more, the character\u2019s moral and social standing with the NPC\u2019s faction in <em>Skyrim</em> began to influence the AI\u2019s reactions to the player\u2019s actions. \u201cYour friend would let you eat the apple in his house,\u201d Bethesda Studios creative director Todd Howard told <a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/games/the_elder_scrolls_v_skyrim/b/xbox360/archive/2011/01/17/the-technology-behind-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim.aspx\"><em>Game Informer</em></a> in 2011, rather than reporting you to the town guard like they would if the relationship were strained.</p><h2>Modern AIs</h2><p>Naughty Dog\u2019s <em>The Last of Us </em>series offers some of today\u2019s most advanced NPC behaviors for enemies and allies alike. \u201cCharacters give the illusion of intelligence when they are placed in well thought-out setups, are responsive to the player, play convincing animations and sounds, and behave in interesting ways,\u201d Mark Botta, Senior Software Engineer at Ripple Effect Studios, wrote in <a href=\"http://www.gameaipro.com/GameAIPro2/GameAIPro2_Chapter33_Infected_AI_in_The_Last_of_Us.pdf\"><em>Infected AI in</em> The Last of Us</a>. \u201cYet all of this is easily undermined when they mindlessly run into walls or do any of the endless variety of things that plague AI characters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot only does eliminating these glitches provide a more polished experience,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut it is amazing how much intelligence is attributed to characters that simply don\u2019t do stupid things.\u201d</p><p>You can see this in both the actions of enemies, whether they\u2019re human Hunters or infected Clickers, or allies like Joel\u2019s ward, Ellie. The game\u2019s two primary flavors of enemy combatant are built on the same base AI system but \u201cfeel fundamentally different\u201d from one another thanks to a \u201cmodular AI architecture that allows us to easily add, remove, or change decision-making logic,\u201d Botta wrote.</p><p>The key to this architecture was never referring to the enemy character types in the code but rather, \u201c[specifying] sets of characteristics that define each type of character,\u201d Botta said. \u201cFor example, the code refers to the <em>vision type</em> of the character instead of testing if the character is a Runner or a Clicker \u2026 Rather than spreading the character definitions as conditional checks throughout the code, it centralizes them in tunable data.\u201d Doing so empowers the designers to adjust character variations directly instead of having to ask for help from the AI team.</p><p>The AI system is divided into high-level logic (aka \u201cskills\u201d) that dictate the character\u2019s strategy and the low-level \u201cbehaviors\u201d that they use to achieve the goal. Botta points to a character\u2019s \u201cmove-to behavior\u201d as one such example. So when Joel and Ellie come across a crowd of enemy characters, their approach either by stealth or by force is determined by that character\u2019s skills.</p><p>\u201cSkills decide what to do based on the motivations and capabilities of the character, as well as the current state of the environment,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey answer questions like \u2018Do I want to attack, hide, or flee?\u2019 and \u2018What is the best place for me to be?\u2019\u201d And then once the character/player makes that decision, the lower level behaviors trigger to perform the action. This could be Joel automatically ducking into cover and drawing a weapon or Ellie scampering off to a separate nearby hiding spot, avoiding obstacles and enemy sight lines along the way (at least for the Hunters \u2014 Clickers can hear you breathing).</p><h2>Tomorrow\u2019s AIs</h2><p>Generative AI systems have made headlines recently due in large part to the runaway success of next-generation chatbots from Google, Meta, OpenAI and others, but they\u2019ve been a mainstay in game design for years. <em>Dwarf Fortress</em> and <em>Black Rock Galactic</em> just wouldn\u2019t be the same without their procedurally generated levels and environments \u2014 but what if we could apply those generative principles to dialog creation too? That\u2019s what Ubisoft is attempting with its new <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ubisofts-ghostwriter-ai-tool--automatically-generate-video-game-dialogue-103510366.html\">Ghostwriter AI</a>.</p><p>\u201cCrowd chatter and barks are central features of player immersion in games \u2013 NPCs speaking to each other, enemy dialogue during combat, or an exchange triggered when entering an area all provide a more realistic world experience and make the player feel like the game around them exists outside of their actions,\u201d Ubisoft\u2019s Roxane Barth <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=cca828bc-bcd7-4319-b5fa-8cb88f52eae1&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Ubisoft&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjY2E4MjhiYy1iY2Q3LTQzMTktYjVmYS04Y2I4OGY1MmVhZTEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLnViaXNvZnQuY29tL2VuLXVzL2FydGljbGUvN0NtMDd6YkJHeTRYbWw2V2dZaTI1ZC90aGUtY29udmVyZ2VuY2Utb2YtYWktYW5kLWNyZWF0aXZpdHktaW50cm9kdWNpbmctZ2hvc3R3cml0ZXIiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImFkODliZGJiLTM2ZGMtNDUwNi05MGQ0LWMyYmE3ZjllNjhmYSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAATcsE1Vb9g7GC4rVJJo1NCa7vUwf40ywBVmoY-wn5X14&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.ubisoft.com%2Fen-us%2Farticle%2F7Cm07zbBGy4Xml6WgYi25d%2Fthe-convergence-of-ai-and-creativity-introducing-ghostwriter\">wrote in a March blog post</a>. \u201cHowever, both require time and creative effort from scriptwriters that could be spent on other core plot items. Ghostwriter frees up that time, but still allows the scriptwriters a degree of creative control.\u201d</p><p>The use process isn\u2019t all that different from messing around with public chatbots like BingChat and Bard, albeit with a few important distinctions. The scriptwriter will first come up with a character and the general idea of what that person would say. That gets fed into Ghostwriter which then returns a rough list of potential barks. The scriptwriter can then choose a bark and edit it to meet their specific needs. The system will generate these barks in pairs and selecting one over the other serves as a quick training and refinement method, learning from the preferred choice and, with a few thousand repetitions, begins generating more accurate and desirable barks from the outset.</p><p>\u201cGhostwriter was specifically created with games writers, for the purpose of accelerating their creative iteration workflow when writing barks [short phrases]\u201d Yves Jacquier, Executive Director at <a href=\"https://montreal.ubisoft.com/en/our-commitments/research-and-development/\">Ubisoft La Forge</a>, told Engadget via email. \u201cUnlike other existing chatbots, prompts are meant to generate short dialogue lines, not to create general answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom here, there are two important differences,\u201d Jacquier continued. \u201cOne is on the technical aspect: for using Ghostwriter writers have the ability to control and give input on dialogue generation. Second, and it\u2019s a key advantage of having developed our in-house technology: we control on the costs, copyrights and confidentiality of our data, which we can re-use to further train our own model.\u201d</p><p>Ghostwriter\u2019s assistance doesn\u2019t just make scriptwriters\u2019 jobs easier, it in turn helps improve the overall quality of the game. \u201cCreating believable large open worlds is daunting,\u201d Jacquier said. \u201cAs a player, you want to explore this world and feel that each character and each situation is unique, and involve a vast variety of characters in different moods and with different backgrounds. As such there is a need to create many variations to any mundane situation, such as one character buying fish from another in a market.\u201d</p><p>Writing 20 different iterations of ways to shout \u201cfish for sale\u201d is not the most effective use of a writer\u2019s time. \u201cThey might come up with a handful of examples before the task might become tedious,\u201d Jacquier said. \u201cThis is exactly where Ghostwriter kicks in: proposing such dialogs and their variations to a writer, which gives the writer more variations to work with and more time to polish the most important narrative elements.\u201d</p><p>Ghostwriter is one of a growing number of generative AI systems Ubisoft has begun to use, including voice synthesis and text-to-speech. \u201cGenerative AI has quickly found its use among artists and creators for ideation or concept art,\u201c Jacquier said, but clarified that humans will remain in charge of the development process for the foreseeable future, regardless of coming AI advancements . \u201cGames are a balance of technological innovation and creativity and what makes great games is our talent \u2013 the rest are tools. While the future may involve more technology, it doesn\u2019t take away the human in the loop.\u201d</p><h2>7.4887 billion reasons to get excited</h2><p>Per a recent <a href=\"https://market.us/report/generative-ai-in-gaming-market/\">Market.us report</a>, the value of generative AI in the gaming market could as much as septuple by 2032. Growing from around $1.1 billion in 2023 to nearly $7.5 billion in the next decade, these gains will be driven by improvements to NPC behaviors, productivity gains by automating digital asset generation and procedurally generated content creation.</p><p>And it won\u2019t just be major studios cranking out AAA titles that will benefit from the generative AI revolution. Just as we are already seeing dozens and hundreds of mobile apps built atop ChatGPT mushrooming up on Google Play and the App Store for myriad purposes, these foundational models (not necessarily Ghostwriter itself but its invariable open-source derivative) are poised to spawn countless tools which will in turn empower indie game devs, modders and individual players alike. And given how quickly the need to know how to program in proper code rather than natural language is falling off, our holodeck immersive gaming days could be closer than we ever dared hope.</p><p><em>Catch up on all of the news from Summer Game Fest </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/sgf-2023\"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/generative-ai-can-help-bring-tomorrows-gaming-npcs-to-life-163037183.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/generative-ai-can-help-bring-tomorrows-gaming-npcs-to-life-163037183.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-09 16:30:37+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "A PS5 bundle hits a new low, plus the rest of the week's best tech deals", "description": "<p>It's Friday, which means it's time for another roundup of good deals on recommended gadgets and gear.

And while you can\u2019t anticipate every issue, having a good everyday carry kit can go a long way towards handling a huge percentage of situations. Now that said, I don\u2019t consider myself an expert, just someone who appreciates a good tool. And with a number of notable events coming up, I wanted to share some of the things I\u2019ve bought for myself because I think they will also make great gifts for Father\u2019s Day, graduations or any other cause for celebration.</p><h2>Quiet Carry Q3 Key Organizer</h2><p></p><p>For a long time I was looking for a way to trim down my keychain while also adding utility, and with the <a href=\"https://quietcarry.com/collections/edc-tools/products/q3-key-organizer-titanium-bl\">Quiet Carry Q3</a>, I think I found the answer. It\u2019s capable of holding four keys (or up to eight with the included extension posts) in its extremely durable titanium housing, alongside your choice of either a small knife or multi-tool. For me, the utility blade is the perfect thing for quickly screwing down a tripod mount or opening a bottle, while the removable pocket clip makes it a cinch to snap the Q3 onto your pants or belt loop. All told, it\u2019s a clean and compact way of storing your keys, and it helps prevent them from rattling around too, which is an extra bonus.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><h2>Leatherman Skeletool</h2><p></p><p>There are an endless variety of multitools out there, but to me the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=a987c281-0637-4dc1-b860-d17af2f9a4ca&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Leatherman&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJhOTg3YzI4MS0wNjM3LTRkYzEtYjg2MC1kMTdhZjJmOWE0Y2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGVhdGhlcm1hbi5jb20vc2tlbGV0b29sLTE4Lmh0bWw_IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwOGNkM2EyNC0xZTdmLTQ0YzctOTA0NC01Yzg1ZWZiZjExNWMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAeaDfYCHW7rlcNuGfn5M175oannuFq5AhbpfIn-xSg8B&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.leatherman.com%2Fskeletool-18.html%3F\">Leatherman Skeletool</a> offers the perfect balance of size, weight and functionality. In the 10 years I\u2019ve had mine, it\u2019s never let me down once. It\u2019s available in a wide range of colors, while Leatherman\u2019s strategic cutouts help keep the weight of its stainless steel frame to a minimum (just five ounces). And thanks to its needle nose pliers, combo knife, large bit driver and more, it\u2019s got all the most important bases covered. So while it might not have as many bits and bobbles as larger rivals, its lightweight and compact size means it\u2019s the one I grab first before I run out the door.</p><h2>SanDisk Ultra Dual USB Drive</h2><p></p><p>As we\u2019re still in the midst of the transition from USB-A to USB-C, this simple gadget is not only the cheapest gift on this list, it\u2019s also the one I use the most. <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TYW5EaXNrLTI1NkdCLVVsdHJhLURyaXZlLVR5cGUtQy9kcC9CMDdZWUpMMjFaLz90aD0xJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTExZC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMDhjZDNhMjQtMWU3Zi00NGM3LTkwNDQtNWM4NWVmYmYxMTVjIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAcOdM-WRGbyeS4NmDNWywpmHCH0XCYKDXUgchmgbVUI6&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSanDisk-256GB-Ultra-Drive-Type-C%2Fdp%2FB07YYJL21Z%2F%3Fth%3D1\">SanDisk\u2019s drive</a> is available in capacities of up to 512GB and supports USB 3.1 for decent read speeds of up to 150 MB/s. But the best thing is that by simply rotating which end is sticking out, you can transfer data to basically any device with a USB port. Trying to transfer photos to an old desktop that only has USB-A? No problem. How about a tablet that only has a single USB-C connector? Easy. It can even help you offload media from a phone with OTG support so you can install that big software update (stop procrastinating, please). And with its tiny dimensions, you probably won\u2019t even notice it dangling on your keychain, so you can always have it on you.</p><h2>Distil Wally Sleeve</h2><p></p><p>For people who prefer a lighter, more minimalist way of carrying their cards and cash, the $50 <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2Rpc3RpbHVuaW9uLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0cy93YWxseS1zbGVldmUiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjA4Y2QzYTI0LTFlN2YtNDRjNy05MDQ0LTVjODVlZmJmMTE1YyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAdj8mriIHoS5ZZgEkSsKcWf1BoW8LCcpTv58uCR88G4v&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fdistilunion.com%2Fproducts%2Fwally-sleeve\">Wally Sleeve</a> is a super compact and affordable option. It\u2019s made from full-grain leather and can hold up to seven cards in its RFID-shielded main sleeve. On the outside, there\u2019s another pocket for cash or transit cards so you can tap them on a sensor without needing to completely remove them from your wallet. But the Wally Sleeve\u2019s best feature is its MagLock closure, which prevents your cards from spilling out. Combine that with a built-in pull tab and you get a slim sleeve that provides easy access to everything you need with zero fumbling.</p><h2>Pioneer Division Billfold Wallet</h2><p></p><p>Alternatively, if you\u2019re looking for a more traditional wallet, the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Bpb25lZXJjYXJyeS5jb20vY29sbGVjdGlvbnMvc2hvcC1hbGwvcHJvZHVjdHMvZGl2aXNpb24tYmlsbGZvbGQiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjA4Y2QzYTI0LTFlN2YtNDRjNy05MDQ0LTVjODVlZmJmMTE1YyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAei2Mk8BNN-gLXuwPLdKOv-clhFkWVzpYqeCzeXptWVW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fpioneercarry.com%2Fcollections%2Fshop-all%2Fproducts%2Fdivision-billfold\">Division Billfold</a> is a slick choice that blends a classic design with new-school materials. Pioneer says the polyethylene yarn that makes up its 10XD fabric (available on the black, blue, forest and onyx colors) is ten times stronger than steel, so it should look great for years. It\u2019s also dirt- and water-resistant, and thanks to a range of pockets and sleeves, it can hold a ton of cards and bills. And for those who want a bit of extra security, the onyx and forest color options also come with RFID shielding.</p><h2>Peak Design 35L Travel Duffel</h2><p></p><p>I don\u2019t know what it is, but I have a thing for bags.

It\u2019s the perfect thing for a weekend trip, but I\u2019ve always used it for groceries, too. More recently, it\u2019s become a baby bag for carrying everything I need to have on hand for a fussy toddler. Not only is it durable thanks to its weatherproof 600D nylon canvas shell, it has removable handles and tons of eyelets scattered around the duffle so you can rearrange the straps however you want. It can be set up like a backpack if you want. Or if you\u2019re lugging some gear, you can stuff three of Peak Design\u2019s packing cubes in there (or four cubes on the 65L duffel) so all your camera equipment is nice and protected. It\u2019s really a do-everything bag.</p><h2>Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro 2 / AirPods Pro</h2><p></p><p>While some of the other devices on this list might get left at home on odd days, my <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TQU1TVU5HLUJsdWV0b290aC1DYW5jZWxsaW5nLUNvbnZlcnNhdGlvbi1SZXNpc3RhbnQvZHAvQjBCMlNINENONi8_dGg9MSZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby0xMWQtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjA4Y2QzYTI0LTFlN2YtNDRjNy05MDQ0LTVjODVlZmJmMTE1YyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAS3w7TcmWr-0z1T2WdWnFhDY0EhcJBBpmPSags3FQGmq&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Cancelling-Conversation-Resistant%2Fdp%2FB0B2SH4CN6%2F%3Fth%3D1\">Galaxy Buds 2 Pro</a> never leave my side. Despite their small size, Samsung\u2019s buds deliver great sound, active noise cancellation and between six and eight hours of battery life (depending on if you use ANC). They are also some of the most comfortable earbuds I\u2019ve ever worn, to the point that I use them at night to help me fall asleep. And thanks to their IPX7 rating for water resistance, they were able to survive an accidental trip through the wash without issue.

After buying them for my wife six months ago and using them off and on (when she lets me), I\u2019ve been looking for an excuse to buy a pair of my own. They look good, they\u2019re easy to setup, and their sound quality is unmatched, while Sony\u2019s top-notch noise cancellation helps drown out unwanted disturbances. And with a battery that lasts about 30 hours (with ANC on), I typically only have to charge them about once a week. The one little annoyance I\u2019ve found is that you can\u2019t use them while charging, but since they have the ability to add three hours of juice in just 30 minutes, that\u2019s hardly a deal breaker.</p><h2>Valve Steam Deck</h2><p></p><p>For people who want to take their PC games on the go, <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N0b3JlLnN0ZWFtcG93ZXJlZC5jb20vc3RlYW1kZWNrIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwOGNkM2EyNC0xZTdmLTQ0YzctOTA0NC01Yzg1ZWZiZjExNWMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARTgoQdl64JAs-OzHS_VPggxPXC2GlL3c-FJ_8ycDDlt&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fsteamdeck\">Valve\u2019s Steam Deck</a> is a present that will keep on giving. At just $400, it\u2019s by far the cheapest of the latest breed of handheld gaming PCs, while still having more than enough oomph to play modern titles like <em>Elden Ring</em> at smooth frame rates and medium settings. Even though Valve\u2019s Linux-basedSteam OS might be unfamiliar to some, Big Picture mode is super easy to use. And thanks to tons of software updates the number of Steam Deck-verified games sits at just shy of 10,000. Really, it\u2019s just a great gift for any PC gamer who needs some extra alone time, regardless of whether they\u2019re on the couch or on the road.</p><h2>Hoto Precision Screwdriver set</h2><p></p><p>Now I will admit I don\u2019t carry this on my every day, but when it comes time to tinker or repair some electronics, <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2hvdG90b29scy5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvaG90by1lbGVjdHJpYy0yNWluMS1wcmVjaXNpb24tc2NyZXdkcml2ZXItc2V0IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIwOGNkM2EyNC0xZTdmLTQ0YzctOTA0NC01Yzg1ZWZiZjExNWMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWb1wnxeS-Cj4FtUb3ZoeU1tzpSdl-xYDOpg-CWSmp-b&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fhototools.com%2Fproducts%2Fhoto-electric-25in1-precision-screwdriver-set\">this set</a> is the first thing I grab. The included carrying case holds 25 steel bits that work with all the most common screw heads (Torx, pentalobe, tri-wing, and more) while the magnetic screwdriver chuck makes switching bits in and out a breeze. You also get one-touch controls for automatic screwing and unscrewing, while still having the flexibility to turn things in manually in more delicate situations. Finally, thanks to its built-in USB-C port, you\u2019ll never need to worry about finding an annoying proprietary charging brick.</p><h2>Sterling and Roark Solid Fragrance</h2><p></p><p>About a year ago I was looking for an alternative to traditional liquid colognes when I stumbled on these: solid fragrances from <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2Z1bHRvbmFuZHJvYXJrLmNvbS9jb2xsZWN0aW9ucy9hbGwtZnJhZ3JhbmNlcyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMDhjZDNhMjQtMWU3Zi00NGM3LTkwNDQtNWM4NWVmYmYxMTVjIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAZi5eSdQhwr87_eNhpyhtaTghRduHYDYxdsKTzw2M3xm&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Ffultonandroark.com%2Fcollections%2Fall-fragrances\">Fulton and Roark</a>. Not only do they smell great, they come in small metal tin that makes them very travel friendly and easy to refill. My favorite scent is Calle Ocho, which is a soothing mix of rum, tobacco and sandalwood. But if you don\u2019t know which type of fragrance your loved one prefers, you can simply get a <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2Z1bHRvbmFuZHJvYXJrLmNvbS9jb2xsZWN0aW9ucy9zYW1wbGUtcGFja3MiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjA4Y2QzYTI0LTFlN2YtNDRjNy05MDQ0LTVjODVlZmJmMTE1YyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAe-PxU6ObsaOFHtHFNYYMGzPHtC2LEkiD4JzbX6cyg7p&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Ffultonandroark.com%2Fcollections%2Fsample-packs\">Discovery set</a> and let them pick a favorite.

And Microsoft\u2019s HoloLens is courting a completely different audience with different needs.

You\u2019ll strap in to play a round of <em>Beat Saber</em>, meet your friends in Horizon Worlds or preview your company\u2019s latest product design, but switch to your computer or phone for almost everything else.</p><p>That\u2019s fine in many cases. You probably don\u2019t want to play VR games for long periods, and you might rarely need an AR collaboration tool. But that also limits the incentive to buy a headset if it\u2019s not for general use. And while Meta envisions Quest users spending much of their time in the metaverse, it <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/how-meta-flunked-its-first-year-as-a-metaverse-company-150049067.html\"><ins>hasn\u2019t made a compelling argument</ins></a> for the concept.

And that\u2019s backed up by data: <em>The Wall Street Journal</em><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2f007401-3eaa-4237-b69b-54ccbe125502&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Wall+Street+Journal&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyZjAwNzQwMS0zZWFhLTQyMzctYjY5Yi01NGNjYmUxMjU1MDIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9tZXRhLW1ldGF2ZXJzZS1ob3Jpem9uLXdvcmxkcy16dWNrZXJiZXJnLWZhY2Vib29rLWludGVybmFsLWRvY3VtZW50cy0xMTY2NTc3ODk2MSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZTgyMjAzMTEtZjM2OS00NmQzLWEwOTktZWY3NWY0MTlhMDA4In0&amp;signature=AQAAARglCnp9Ruh-V_r_sIa-0hw_SgVGdQ5QuEzNGCXPzRTT&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Fmeta-metaverse-horizon-worlds-zuckerberg-facebook-internal-documents-11665778961\"><ins>reported last fall</ins></a> that most Horizon Worlds users don\u2019t come back at all after the first month, and only nine percent of worlds have ever had more than 50 visitors.</p><p>The interface is barebones, too. While there\u2019s a degree of multitasking, Meta\u2019s front-end is largely designed to run one app at a time. There\u2019s not much flexibility for positioning and resizing your apps, and you can\u2019t really run 2D and 3D programs side-by-side. This helps make the most of modest hardware (more on that later), but you aren\u2019t about to replace an office PC with a Quest Pro.</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-realityos-ar-vr-headset-operating-system-wwdc-2023-185901735.html\"><ins>VisionOS</ins></a> is precisely what it sounds like: a general-purpose operating system. It\u2019s clearly designed for running multiple apps at once, with a sophisticated virtual desktop that can juggle 2D and 3D software placed throughout your physical space. It includes familiar apps like the Safari web browser, and it can run hundreds of thousands of iPad and iPhone titles. That\u2019s critical \u2014 even if you rarely need mixed reality apps, you can still take advantage of a vast software library without connecting to a computer. Meta has just over 1,000 apps in its store, and while all of those are designed with headsets in mind, they just won\u2019t cover as many use cases.</p><p>Even at this early stage, the Vision Pro offers a greater breadth of possibilities. Yes, you can watch videos, make video calls or access your computer like you would on other headsets, but you also have enhanced versions of key apps from your phone or tablet, like Messages and Photos. You can play conventional video games on a virtual display. And since you have an extra-sharp view of the outside world, it\u2019s easier to interact with others than it has been with past wearables \u2014 during the keynote, Apple showed people talking to coworkers and friends. My colleague Devindra says the Vision Pro interface is <em>Minority Report</em>-like in its sheer power and ease of use, and that\u2019s no small compliment given how that movie\u2019s portrayal of holographic computing is considered a Holy Grail.</p><p>And before you ask: While Microsoft\u2019s HoloLens could easily be seen as the parent of Vision Pro-style spatial computing, Apple isn\u2019t just following the lead. Aging hardware notwithstanding (HoloLens 2 has been around since 2019), Microsoft\u2019s headset and interface are aimed primarily at business customers who need specialized mixed reality apps and only occasionally dip into semi-conventional software <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-full-teams-integration-hololens-2-115542390.html\"><ins>like Teams</ins></a>. Apple\u2019s platform is simply more comprehensive. It\u2019s meant to be used by everyone, even if the initial device is best-suited to developers and pros.</p><h2>Hardware: A computer on your head</h2><h2></h2><figure><img alt=\"Apple Vision Pro headset at WWDC 2023\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/12e5ab70-063c-11ee-9ff6-8551a85ae51b\" style=\"height: 1040px; width: 1917px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><h2></h2><p>The technology in mixed reality headsets like Meta\u2019s Quest line is frequently optimized for battery life and light weight at the expense of performance. Their mobile-oriented chips aren\u2019t usually powerful enough to handle multiple demanding apps or render photorealistic visuals, and even the Quest Pro\u2019s Snapdragon XR2+ chip has its roots in the 865 that powered the three-year-old Galaxy S20. There are advantages to this (you wouldn\u2019t want a heavy headset during a <em>Supernatural</em> workout), but there\u2019s also no question that Meta, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/vive-xr-elite-hands-on-ht-cs-even-more-portable-answer-to-the-meta-quest-pro-ces-2023-203019745.html\"><ins>HTC</ins></a> and others are making deliberate tradeoffs.</p><p>If Meta\u2019s mixed reality proposition revolves around lean, focused headsets that get you into the metaverse, Apple\u2019s Vision Pro is a do-it-all machine. The M2 inside is a laptop-class chip that can easily run multiple apps at once with rich graphics, and the 4K per eye resolution ensures you won\u2019t have to squint at a web browser or spreadsheet on a virtual desktop. It\u2019s also one of the few headsets that can capture 3D photos and videos, although that\u2019s admittedly a novelty at the moment.</p><p>Apple is also taking a very different approach to input than Meta, or even Microsoft. While eye and hand tracking aren\u2019t new, Apple is relying on them exclusively for navigating the general interface. You only want to use physical controllers if you\u2019re playing conventional games or prefer the speed of typing on a real keyboard. And unlike HoloLens, you don\u2019t need to point or otherwise make conspicuous gestures. You just look at what you want and pinch your fingers to manipulate it, even if your hands are on your lap. The Vision Pro is meant to be intuitive and comfortable for extended periods, like a computer, even if that means giving up the conveniences of buttons and triggers.</p><h2>A new strategy doesn\u2019t solve everything, but it might help</h2><h2></h2><figure><img alt=\"Apple Vision Pro headset in use\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/78d62a90-063c-11ee-bffd-6842f3c4fd4e\" style=\"height: 1280px; width: 1920px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Apple</div></figure><h2></h2><p>This isn\u2019t to say that Apple has addressed all of mixed reality\u2019s problems just by taking a different approach. Headsets still create solitary, isolating experiences. While you could more realistically wear a Vision Pro all day than a Quest Pro due to the stronger app selection and higher-resolution display, you\u2019re still putting a screen between yourself and the outside world. It\u2019s heavier than you might like. Apple also hasn\u2019t solved the too-short battery life that\u2019s common in this category, so you won\u2019t be free to roam during the workday.</p><p>The $3,499 price underscores one of the biggest challenges: It\u2019s difficult to make technology that lives up to the promises of mixed reality while remaining accessible to everyday users. Apple may have found a way to put a fast, easy-to-use computer on your head, but it hasn\u2019t figured out how to make that computer affordable. It\u2019s a much riskier strategy than Meta\u2019s in that regard. Meta is undoubtedly cost-conscious (it even dropped the Quest Pro\u2019s price to $999), and is gradually upgrading its hardware to make mixed reality more viable at a given price. See the $499 Quest 3\u2019s pass-through cameras as an example. Apple, meanwhile, is betting that it\u2019s more important to nail the execution first and think about affordability later.</p><p>Is Apple\u2019s overall strategy better? Not necessarily. Meta may be struggling to popularize the metaverse, but it\u2019s still the current frontrunner in mixed reality hardware for a reason: It offers well-made, reasonably priced headsets with enough useful apps to appeal to enthusiasts. As alluring as Apple\u2019s spatial computing debut might be, it\u2019s also untested. There\u2019s no guarantee people will take a chance on the Vision Pro, even if rumors of an <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-reportedly-working-cheaper-mixed-reality-headset-063000889.html\"><ins>eventual lower-cost model</ins></a> prove true.</p><p>With that said, Apple\u2019s different direction is notable. Mixed reality is still a niche industry, even as much as Meta and other companies have done to expand its appeal. Even if Apple fails with the Vision Pro, it will at least show more of what\u2019s possible and provide lessons that could improve the technology at large.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apples-pitch-for-the-vision-pro-couldnt-be-more-different-than-the-meta-quest-120001109.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/apples-pitch-for-the-vision-pro-couldnt-be-more-different-than-the-meta-quest-120001109.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-09 12:00:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Amazon's Echo Show 8 is 42 percent off right now", "description": "<p>There are so many <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-smart-display-202448797.html\">good smart displays</a> out there that it can be hard to choose which one to buy.

It\u2019s a gaming industry shindig for developers and publishers to build hype for the titles they\u2019re working on right now. But while the business has never been bigger or more profitable, there\u2019s also a sense the gaming industry is shrinking.</p><p>Much of this is because two of the biggest players, Microsoft and Sony, are doing whatever they can to consolidate their power and influence.
