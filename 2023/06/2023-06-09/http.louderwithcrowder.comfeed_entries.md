<p>The problem is leftists disagree with you as a parent having these conversations with your children. And for unclear reasons, LGBTQ activists double disagree with you as a parent having conversation with your own children about sexuality. It is 2023 and thinking you have a right as a parent to talk to your children about sexuality is homo- and/or transphobic. Something that Call of Duty and Activision agree with.</p><p>Yet the same people celebrating a gamer for saying "leave kids alone" don't understand why apolitical, normie-Americans are speaking out and rebelling against corporations like Bud Light and Target. Go figure.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

On the heels of an EIGHT FIGHT win streak and (in theory) one victory away from a lightweight title shot, Dariush talks about Conor McGregor, The Ultimate Fighter, his faith, his UFC 289 opponent Charles Oliveira and much more.</p><h3>"This Jesus freak, this freaking zealot..."</h3><br /><p>
	Beneil is facing Charles Oliveira this weekend, who is the former lightweight champion. There are many who think Beneil should be fighting for the title instead. Questions have been asked if his being an outspoken Christian might have something to do with him being passed over.
</p><div class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" style="display: flex; width: 100%; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"></div> <blockquote>
	I know what they think in the back. "This Jesus freak, this freaking zealot... He's not 'sellable'" is the way they look at me.  Which is okay. I didn't come here to be sellable. I came here to use the gifts got gave me. I'll stick with that.</blockquote><p>
	Beneil's most explicit profession of his faith came after a win at UFC 280 where the Iranian-born Dariush told an audience in the United Arab Emirates: "This might be the most important thing you'll ever hear: there is true freedom, a freedom that no one can take from you in the name of Jesus Christ, the son of God. Don't ever forget that. If you remember one thing I say, remember that." </p><h3>Beneil vs Conor McGregor?</h3><br /><p>
	Crowder also asked about a fight against another former lightweight champion, Conor McGregor. Beneil doesn't think it will ever happen.
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Ahead of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UFC289?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#UFC289</a>, what does Beneil Dariush think of a potential <a href="https://twitter.com/TheNotoriousMMA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@TheNotoriousMMA</a> fight? <a href="https://t.co/GkW7oNCsh0">pic.twitter.com/GkW7oNCsh0</a><br />‚Äî Louder with Crowder Dot Com (@LWCnewswire) <a href="https://twitter.com/LWCnewswire/status/1667156520373477378?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 9, 2023</a></blockquote> <blockquote>
	I don't think I'll ever get my hands on him. I just don't think he's in the game anymore. I honestly don't know if he's even going to fight [Michael] Chandler, to be honest with you. I think he's not ... he wants to be on the camera. But the work you have to put in to fight, the weight you have to cut. It's not an easy thing"
</blockquote><p class="">Beneil Dariush fights Charles Oliveria this Saturday,  June 10th, at UFC 289. It is available to watch exclusively through pay-per-view on ESPN+. </p>

	Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Anthony Bass is still catching the vapors for "amplifying" what critics call an "anti-LGBTQ" post. His groveling apology not being enough, and so the Blue Jays as a corporation can complete the process of being bullied by activists, Bass will catch the ceremonial first pitch during the franchise's weekend-long Pride celebration.

	That's right, DotCommies. The pitcher is being forced to play catcher.

	Don't look at me like that. You know that's why they are forcing him to do this.
</p><p>
<br />
</p><h3>What did Anthony Bass do?</h3><br /><p>
	I'll be honest, I'm not 100% sure what Bass did. When he gave his sniveling apology hitting on all the usual talking points -- apologizing to his "friends" in the LGBTQ community, apologizing for "embarrassing" his teammates. claiming he'll work towards better "educating" himself -- I assumed he spoke out against the Los Angeles Dodgers paying tribute to Pride by <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/los-angeles-dodgers-pitcher-pride" target="_blank">telling 330 million Catholics to go f*ck themselves</a>.
</p><div class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" style="display: flex; width: 100%; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"></div><p>The best I can tell is he "amplified" the following video about boycotting Target.
</p> <p>
	What "amplify" means, I have no idea. Did he share it in Instagram stories? Like the post? Who knows? The bottom line is he made a sudden movement that upset LGBTQ activists.</p><h3>His apology wasn't enough?</h3><br /><p>An apology is never enough. <a href="https://www.thestar.com/sports/bluejays/opinion/2023/05/30/the-jays-have-to-get-rid-of-anthony-bass-how-many-strikes-does-it-take.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Toronto Star columnist Gregor Chisholm</a> wanted him fired from his job over the hate crime of liking an Instagram post.</p><blockquote>Freedom of speech doesn‚Äôt mean freedom from consequences, especially in the corporate world, and some players are more disposable than others. With Pride Month just around the corner, the Jays would be wise to wash their hands of this mess entirely instead of playing the role of enabler.</blockquote><p>If you don't bend the knee to a radical progressive agenda, they'll make you bend the knee. In the case of LGBTQAI+EIEIO bullies -- especially during June -- they have the full weight of the Democrat Party and the media (but I repeat myself) to bring down on you.</p><p class="">Hence the pitcher is forced to play catcher. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>If you want to know why average, non-political Americans are starting to rebel against Bud Light and Target, it's bullsh*t like this. A public figure is being forced down on his knees over the crime of sharing an Instagram post. When had he shared an anti-Christian post or one attacking the half of the country who hates Joe Biden, those same people would be celebrating him.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

Lord knows Disney is desperate for anything that will make them money at this point. Instead, Depp has told the Mouse if they want a new <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em> movie, they should go ask if Amber Heard is available.</p><p>After Disney (along with the rest of Hollywood) threw Depp under the bus over Heard's false allegations of abuse, the actor wants nothing to do with Disney, Mickey Mouse, or another move in the franchise.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>Amber Heard accused Johnny Depp of abuse. Because she is a girl and Depp is not, he <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/uh-oh-johnny-depp-may-actually-be-the-victim-of-amber-heards-domestic-abuse" target="_blank">was deemed guilty by the entertainment industry</a>. Disney was one of those companies that had Depp attached to their lucrative <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em> franchise.</p><p>As we now know <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/amber-heard-portnoy-wapo" target="_blank">a lawsuit and a $15 million settlement later</a>, Heard lied about all of it. She also <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/amber-heard-johnny-depp-fecal" target="_blank">may or may not have left a poop in their bed</a>. Whether it was her poop, the dog's poop, or the dog's poop that she put in the bed... that was not made clear by a jury of her peers.<br /></p><p>Depp sounds like he is done with Hollywood entirely. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/johnny-depp-standing-ovation" target="_blank">He said in Cannes</a>: <em> "You wanna live that kind of life, I wish you the best. But I'll be on the other side."</em></p>

<p>Deep friends and other anonymous sources <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-12166857/Johnny-Depp-REFUSING-return-Disneys-Pirates-Caribbean.html?ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_campaign=1490&amp;ito=social-twitter_dailymailus" target="_blank">tell The Daily Mail</a> that when it comes to the actor doing anything with Disney again, they can all suck it.</p><blockquote>Despite furious speculation about the actor's potential return to the <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em> franchise - which reports suggested could earn him up to $20 million - Depp is, his pals say, done with Disney once and for all because he is still furious over the way the studio unceremoniously 'dropped him' when his ex-wife Amber Heard accused him of abuse.<br /><br />Insiders say that Depp is still smarting after the way that they dumped him when the wife-beating accusations first surfaced.<br /> <br />'They blind dropped him even though Amber had lied her a** off,' says a friend.<br /></blockquote><p>Depp is saying he won't go back no matter how big the bag is. We'll see. Disney is <a href="https://insidethemagic.net/2023/06/disney-tried-save-money-cutting-streaming-titles-loses-1-5-billion-instead-jb1/" target="_blank">looking to lose $2 BILLION over their failed content</a>. They could leave a pretty sizable bag in desperation. But my gut tells me the actor is done with the entire movie industry as an institution.</p><p>He and his family will always be comfortable. He can pick and choose projects he wants to work on with people who didn't stab him in the back.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
