In the 15th-century Anderleto, Imamovi\u0107\u2019s playing of his Persian lute, pressing and tingling, frames a tale of adultery in a magical balance of beauty and dread.</p><p>Snijeg Pade (The Snow Has Fallen), a folk song about the unfairness of a forced, loveless marriage, packs a different, dirge-like, grungy power: after Imamovi\u0107 performed it at Pride in Sarajevo in 2019, the LGBTQ+ movement in the Balkans adopted it as an unofficial anthem. Imamovi\u0107 rewrites the last two verses of Te\u0161ko Je Ljubit Tajno (It\u2019s Hard to Love in Secret) to create a triumphant narrative for the male protagonists, too. One cannot tell his late mother about his love, but the other is urged to: \u201cTell yours / For together we will win.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/09/damir-imamovic-the-world-and-all-that-it-holds-review\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/09/damir-imamovic-the-world-and-all-that-it-holds-review", "date_published": "2023-06-09 08:00:54+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Law of Tehran to Clueless: the seven best films to watch on TV this week", "description": "<p>A tough cop hunts a crime kingpin in an ace Iranian thriller, plus the triumphant and hilarious 90s romcom starring Alicia Silverstone</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/09/law-of-tehran-to-clueless-the-seven-best-films-to-watch-on-tv-this-week\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/09/law-of-tehran-to-clueless-the-seven-best-films-to-watch-on-tv-this-week", "date_published": "2023-06-09 08:00:54+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Saudi Arabia has bought into soccer and golf.
