Mortal Kombat 1’s announcement trailer generated ridiculous levels of excitement, to no one’s surprise, and with NetherRealm Studios setting the stage for a rebooted universe that’ll be putting a different spin on the franchise, fans have been more than a little curious to see what the actual game will look like. 

To that end, hot off the game’s announcement, NetherRealm recently brought Mortal Kombat 1 to Summer Game Fest, debuting an excellent gameplay demonstration that may very well have stolen the show. Gorgeous visuals, interesting glimpses of how characters and relationships will be changed in this new and rebooted universe, a deep dive into the new Kameo fighters system- the gameplay reveal was packed with all of this information and more. Here, we’re going to go through those details.

All things considered, Alone in the Dark looks like a promising reimagining of the influential survival horror classic. There are some rough edges here and there, but by and large - Alone in the Dark is looking to be on the right track. We have some really high hopes for this project and the game seems really focused to not only bring back fans of the original but also introduce the franchise to a modern audience. 

As it stands, the fate of this franchise belongs in the hands of this revival - and we genuinely hope that the beloved IP finds a new life amongst the modern horror staples on the market.
