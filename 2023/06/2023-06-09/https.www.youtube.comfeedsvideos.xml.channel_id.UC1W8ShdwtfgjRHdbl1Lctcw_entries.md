I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of Berlin Germany 1900-1910, we can see what's going on in broad daylight, with many carriages and hors, streetcars and people going about their business.

Video Restoration Process:
âœ” FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
âœ” Image resolution boosted up to HD 
âœ” Improved video sharpness and brightness 
âœ” Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
âœ”added sound only for the ambiance
âœ”restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 
âœ” SKY Visual Effects (not historically accurate)

Please, be aware that colorization colors and SKY Visual Effects are not real and fake, colorization and VFX was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
