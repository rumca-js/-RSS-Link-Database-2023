<p>Before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/transformers-rise-of-the-beasts-review-robots-in-decline/1900-6418076/">Rise of the Beasts</a>, Transformers was an exceedingly white franchise, with white leads in every movie and a white guy in the director's chair every time out. Rise of the Beasts represents a major break from that franchise tendency, though, with a Black director and two people of color in the lead roles. It's a pleasantly surprising shift, and it began with the hiring of Creed 2 director Steven Caple Jr. to sit behind the camera.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm trying to cast people who look like me, and who just don't get the opportunity to be in this position and/or be on these platforms and showcase our talent," Caple told GameSpot.</p><p dir="ltr">As it turns out, one of the people who had a hand in inspiring Caple to become a filmmaker in the first place was the white guy who directed five of the not-diverse previous Transformers flicks, Michael Bay. It was the first Bad Boys film that gave Caple that initial spark--because it was a big studio action flick with two Black lead actors.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-transformers-rise-of-the-beasts-director-was-inspired-to-make-a-more-diverse-robot-blockbuster/1100-6515046/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Being the seventh movie in a giant franchise, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts doesn't exist in a vacuum. A movie like this always has an eye on what's next--or at least what <em>could be</em> next. And it's got at least one very clear idea for a sequel.</p><p dir="ltr">At the end of Rise of the Beasts, our main human hero, Noah Diaz (Anthony Ramos), returns to his old life in Brooklyn. He still needs a job, and he's got an interview. But it's going a bit oddly, because this guy he's interviewing with seems to know all about his big adventure with the Transformers.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Warning: This remainder of this article contains spoilers for the ending of Transformers: Rise of the Beasts</strong></p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-transformers-rise-of-the-beasts-the-start-of-a-hasbro-cinematic-universe/1100-6515045/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## The Hardest Boss In Diablo 4 Has Already Been Defeated

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4</a> has only been officially out for less than a week, and one player has already managed to clear its hardest challenge and defeat the most challenging boss, all while playing in Hardcore mode.</p><p dir="ltr">Thanks to <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/diablo-4/news/world-first-recorded-hc-uber-lilith-kill-by-ben-333419">Wowhead</a>, we know that a Twitch streamer who goes by the name <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ben_">Ben_</a> was able to defeat Lilith. Ben_ defeated her with their Barbarian class character and used their "Spinnywinny" alongside other moves that complemented his Whirlwind damage to help him defeat the demon.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">For those who are unaware, the Echo of Lilith is an optional level 100 boss players can fight. The only way players fight her is by completing the main game first and progressing to the final World Tier. On top of that, she's a lot stronger than her non-Uber phase, and every time she hits a player, they receive a debuff that makes them take even more damage. And on top of that, whenever a player dies in Hardcore Mode, permadeath is enabled. So if they had died during the boss fight, there would have been no way of getting that character back.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-hardest-boss-in-diablo-4-has-already-been-defeated/1100-6515043/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Fitting Magic Into A Military Action Game Means Making A Good Shooter First

<p dir="ltr">Visually, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/immortals-of-aveum/">Immortals of Aveum</a> is one of the most impressive first-person shooters I've seen. Flinging spells with the frenetic intensity of firing a gun is a fun idea, and developer Ascendant Studios has captured it in a brightly colored fantasy world with clear military action game inspirations. The game sees you play as Jak, a battlemage with the rare ability to use all three forms of magic, who is fighting in a war for control of his planet. There are some potentially <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/an-interesting-narrative-twist-might-be-hiding-in-magical-fps-immortals-of-aveum/1100-6513211/">interesting narrative twists hiding in the magical FPS' story</a>, like environmentalism-inspired creature design and set dressing, but the big draw is the fast-paced shooting. Ahead of the game's release, I spoke with Ascendent Studios founder and Immortals of Aveum game director Bret Robbins to talk about how the initial pitch of the game came together and what it takes to make a good magic-based action game.</p><p dir="ltr">"I had been working on Call of Duty before I started [at Ascendant Studios] where, obviously, you get very dialed into what makes a great shooter and how it should play and how it should feel, how the control should feel," Robbins said. "When we started prototyping with Immortals, we did a lot of experimentation very early and we failed fast at a lot of different things. And everyone's familiar with what an assault rifle feels like, what a shotgun feels like. We had to create our own language and our own rules around how magic was going to feel and how it was going to play. And I think early on, especially early in development during our prototyping, we went down pretty complicated and bizarre roads and came up with a lot of weird shit and we were like, 'All right, not sure this is working so well.'"</p><p dir="ltr">With ideas not panning out, the team decided to reset. Instead of initially prioritizing the fantasy side of the world, the game needed to be a great shooter first and foremost. "About a year in, I just said, 'You know what? We need to make a shooter first. We need to make it feel great and then we're going to do all the cool weird stuff we want to do and layer it on top of that,'" Robbins said. "And we spent about six months as a team just really focusing on that. It ended up being this really great combat prototype and that really became the foundation for the game would be. And once we had that, we were like, 'This is the magic shooter. This feels great. This is magic. It's not guns, it's cool, it's fast, you feel powerful.' The whole thing was always about being a battlemage, living that fantasy of being this awesome battlemage. And we nailed it with that prototype and then layered the game on top of that."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fitting-magic-into-a-military-action-game-means-making-a-good-shooter-first/1100-6515042/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Every Nintendo Switch Joy-Con Color Released So Far

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/3957514-3953485-switch-joy-cons.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The Nintendo Switch continues to be a massive hit more than six years after its launch. It's a console that's perfect for use at home or when you're on the go. One of the cleverest elements of the Switch's design are the Joy-Con--detachable controllers that amplify the hybrid nature of this hardware. That detachable focus also gives the Switch a highly-customizable format, one that Nintendo has capitalized on over the years with special-edition console bundles and unique controller color schemes.</p><p>While beauty is in the eye of the beholder, every Joy-Con does look great when in hand. Whether it be standard gray or vibrant green or the <a href="https://shop-links.co/1810586809188826989?u1=subid_value"><strong>upcoming pastel sets</strong></a>, they're eye-pleasing expressions of creativity. We've gathered up every official NA release below, just in case you felt like taking a tour through Switch history. Some of these sets are hard to find nowadays for a number of reasons, so completing your North American set isn't super straightforward. Thankfully, Nintendo has released some Joy-Con individually as well, and <span class="norewrite">           <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=VZfI20jEa0c&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https://www.gamestop.com/search/?q=Joy-Con&amp;lang=default">GameStop sells preowned Joy-Con in singles,</a> </span> so you can mix and match to create your own set. And yes, sometimes Switch owners do have to purchase new pairs of Joy-Con not because they want a new color scheme but due to the unfortunate issue of Joy-Con drift. At least Joy-Con controllers look cool, right?

Nintendo is releasing two sets. The one shown above is the Pastel Purple/Green set.

The bad news is that you can't get these Joy-Cons on their own, as they're only available in the Tears of the Kingdom Switch OLED bundle.

The game's unique aesthetic looked like it had been carved into the Switch and its dock, while the Joy-Con controllers took the default gray base and added some exotic <em>pizzazz </em>to them with even more etchings and elegant lines. Much like the Mario Switch bundle, the Monster Hunter Rise special-edition console isn't available for retail price these days. You can, however, purchase the console at a premium from third-party sellers. Big Monster Hunter fans may still be interested, especially since it also comes with a digital copy of the game.</p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Monster-Hunter-Deluxe-System/dp/B08WWBWPZK?tag=gamespot-promos-20">See at Amazon</a> </div></div><p> </p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Nintendo-Switch-Monster-Hunter-Rise-Deluxe-Edition-System-Switch/549471809">See at Walmart</a> </div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>NES Joy-Con</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/3957530-3952062-untitled-1_0008_switchcontrollers%285%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>While these controllers sported a premium price--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nes-style-switch-joy-cons-look-sick-but-will-set-y/1100-6451365/">$200 to be exact</a>--they still deserve a spot on this list for being an incredible representation of the NES era. A much better application of the color gray that's capped off by vintage design elements and red face buttons, they're the perfect devices to use when you're reliving Nintendo's past with Switch Online games.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD Joy-Con</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/3957529-3952152-zelda-cons.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Now we're talking unique! The Skyward Sword Joy-Con consists of a left controller with a serene blue finish, while the right controller has a royal purple color scheme. Each controller also has Zelda iconography present, such as Triforce and Link symbols that emphasize the Hyrulian heritage to make them stand out. You don't need to buy a brand-new console to own them either, as this pair of Joy-Con was released alongside Skyward Sword HD and sold for the regular $80 price. It's not easy to find the Skyward Sword Joy-Con in stock for retail price, but you can pay a premium for them.</p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Joy-Legend-Zelda-Skyward-Switch/dp/B08WWC1ZPV?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20">See at Amazon</a> </div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Fortnite Fleet Force Limited-Edition Joy-Con</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/3957528-3952063-untitled-1_0002_switchcontrollers%283%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Functionally identical to the Neon Yellow and Blue Joy-Con, the only other extra to tie into Fortnite was an image of the battle royale's iconic party bus on the right-hand controller, which was later replaced by the face of that creepy banana fella. There was also some included DLC such as 500 VBucks and the Fleet Force bundle, but otherwise these Joy-Cons were exhibiting some big Malibu Stacy new hat energy.

For a while, the Animal Crossing Switch console was readily available for retail price.

Specifically, this peripheral pairing was a Best Buy-exclusive that was released close to Luigi's Mansion 3's launch. They kind of look like Gooigi, the delightful pile of goop that looks like Luigi.

Really <em>really </em>red as evidenced by these Super Mario-themed special-edition controllers. Dashing in their bright crimson design, this pair of peripherals were perfect for expressing your fondness for Nintendo's favorite plumber, and they stood out from a mile away with their daring design. These red Joy-Con were only available with the Mario Red and Blue edition Nintendo Switch console, which came with a matching red console, dock, and carrying case. While you can't find this console for retail price nowadays, it's not <em>as expensive </em>as you might expect through third-party sellers.</p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Nintendo-Switch-Mario-Red-Blue-Edition/357859495">See at Walmart</a> </div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Pikachu and Eevee Pokemon Let's Go!

With both of them attached, the end result looked like a caramel bar in your left hand and a slice of custard cake in your right hand. Still, the colors looked great and unusual, so they had some charm.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Gray Joy-Con</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/3957519-3952141-smash-cons.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>For those of you who wanted the gray Joy-Con with a hint of flair but didn't want it to be too flagrant, this Super Smash Bros. Ultimate controller would meet those very specific needs! A splash of 90- and 180-degree gray lines that tie into the game, the same gray aesthetic as the original Joy-Con, and a reminder that drab can be delightful were hallmarks of this design. Smash Bros. Ultimate Joy-Con controllers are very hard to find for a remotely reasonable price these days.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Original Neon Red and Blue Joy-Con</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/3957518-3952128-switch-neon.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>On the other side of the fence, the original Neon Red and Blue Joy-Con simply screamed "Nintendo" as loud as they could from a nearby mountaintop. Compared to the glossy and matte black color schemes chosen by Sony and Microsoft for their controllers, these Joy-Con stood out from the pack as they blended a unique design with eye-catching colors.</p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Joy-Neon-Red-Blue-switch/dp/B01N6QJ58Y?tag=gamespotdeals-20">See at Amazon</a> </div></div><p> </p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Original Gray Joy-Con</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/3957517-3952129-grey-cons.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>While it's easily the plainest color possible for a console that's capable of transmitting beautifully vibrant images, the gray Joy-Con still have an air of sophistication and quality to them. Nondescript and classy, it's the best shade of gray that Nintendo could have chosen when the Switch first hit the market, and five years later, they're still a handsome pair. Unfortunately, the gray Joy-Con have been discontinued, so you have to pay a premium for a new set or buy preowned versions of the right and left Joy-Con at GameStop.</p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=VZfI20jEa0c&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https://www.gamestop.com/gaming-accessories/controllers/nintendo-switch/products/nintendo-switch-joy-con-r-gray/10141932-10141932.html">See at GameStop</a> </div></div><p> </p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Joy-L-R-Gray-switch/dp/B01N6QKT7H?tag=gamespotdeals-20">See at Amazon</a> </div></h3></p><br />

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/alan-wake-ii/">Alan Wake 2</a> launches this fall, and for many players, it will mark the arrival of a project that once seemed impossible. The sequel 13 years in waiting is nearly upon us, which is exciting in its own right, but Remedy's first-ever survival-horror game is just one part of a bigger rollout of upcoming games from Remedy. The team used to take a long time between games, having released only six total between 1996 and 2012, but Remedy has picked up the pace since then, with four console games since 2016 and a fifth due out this fall.</p><p dir="ltr">Furthermore, the team has a record number of in-development projects that go beyond this year's Alan Wake 2, all part of a conscious effort to make more games faster. We decided to round them all up and see what information we could glean from them so far, especially since presumably many or perhaps all of them are in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-alan-wake-2-fits-into-the-remedy-connected-universe/1100-6514866/">Remedy Connected Universe</a>, so the events of Alan Wake 2 may ripple into these future storylines. Here's everything Remedy has announced it's working on so far, including a special section built on some theories related to one project in particular.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 remakes</h2><p dir="ltr">Rockstar and Remedy have seemed to stay close in the decades that followed their collaboration for 2001's Max Payne and 2003's Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne. Now, in an age of video game remakes built from the ground up, Remedy has been given the keys to the Max Payne kingdom once more. Remedy said these games will release as a single title, so players will have access to both stories from one purchase.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/beyond-alan-wake-2-every-game-remedy-is-working-on-right-now/1100-6514998/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The real-world trucking company Schneider National is paying for ads in American Truck Simulator to try to convince people to come work for them.</p><p>SCS Software, the developers of American Truck Simulator, said in a <a href="https://blog.scssoft.com/2023/06/in-game-dynamic-billboards.html">blog post</a> (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/real-life-trucking-companies-are-trying-to-hire-american-truck-simulator-players-with-in-game-ads/">via GamesRadar</a>) that the billboards in the game are now advertising Schneider National and directing players to the company's careers website. This might not be a permanent addition to the game, as SCS said it's only in the "try-out phase." That said, the studio believes the concept "holds promise" for its own games and the automotive industry at large.</p><figure style="width: 1065px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4150680-screenshot2023-06-09at3.29.12pm.png"><img alt="American Truck Simulator is now helping recruit real-world truck drivers" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4150680-screenshot2023-06-09at3.29.12pm.png" /></a><figcaption>American Truck Simulator is now helping recruit real-world truck drivers</figcaption></figure><figure><div class="image-gallery__label">Gallery</div>   <div class="image-gallery__list hide-scrollbar image-gallery__list--small">       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4150681-screenshot2023-06-09at3.29.20pm.png">       <img alt="Gallery image 1" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4150681-screenshot2023-06-09at3.29.20pm.png" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4150682-screenshot2023-06-09at3.29.29pm.png">       <img alt="Gallery image 2" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4150682-screenshot2023-06-09at3.29.29pm.png" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4150683-screenshot2023-06-09at3.29.40pm.png">       <img alt="Gallery image 3" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4150683-screenshot2023-06-09at3.29.40pm.png" />     </a>   </div>  </figure><p>Billboards in American Truck Simulator were previously used to promote new content updates for the game.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/real-trucking-company-is-buying-billboards-in-american-truck-simulator-to-help-recruit-staff/1100-6515039/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Get Good With Fortnite's Kinetic Boomerang

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/everything-new-in-fortnite-chapter-4-season-3/1100-6514994/">Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 3</a> has introduced a ton of cool new gimmicks to Battle Royale, and the one we're all probably going to be using the most is the Kinetic Boomerang. If you were hoping this new weapon would somehow double as a mobility device like the Kinetic Blade and Shockwave Hammer did, sorry--no such luck. This thing is only for attacking your enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">The Kinetic Boomerang is, thankfully, fairly easy to find. <strong>They drop from chests, spawn as floor loot, and, like the Kinetic Blade, there are dedicated boomerang stands in the new jungle area</strong>--look for those old temple ruins that are scattered all throughout that area--where they're guaranteed to spawn every game.</p><p dir="ltr">The Kinetic Boomerang is pretty simple in concept: You throw it, it does damage to the first player or object that it hits--60 damage to players--and then it comes back to you. And it will cause damage to anything it hits along the way back to you. There's no cooldown--as soon as it returns to your hand, you're free to throw it again.

<p>It looks like Activision officially severed ties with Nickmercs, one of Call of Duty's most prominent content creators. The company removed the operator bundle named after him from the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii/">Modern Warfare II</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20/">Warzone</a> store after he made an anti-LGBTQ comment in response to a tweet about Pride Month protests.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/brenonade/status/1666254423096455168?s=20">Chris Puckett</a>, one of esports' most popular commentators, tweeted about the sad state of the country in response to news about anti-LGBTQ protestors attacking Pride supporters outside of a schoolboard meeting in Glendale, CA.

<p>John Wick director Chad Stahelski has confirmed that Oscar-winner Halle Berry, who starred in John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum, is interested in coming back to the John Wick universe. Stahelski also talked about the fate of John Wick himself, <strong>so obviously be aware that spoilers are coming</strong>.</p><p>Concerning Berry's involvement in future John Wick projects, Stahelski said on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1DLu8ms9Nrjc7a8DRTyDFg?si=5bNzE1sXS4evSLdXtnydDw&amp;nd=1">Joe Rogan Experience podcast</a> that Berry has been in talks "several times" to try to come back. He suggested Berry might return in a spinoff, or a "satellite" project, as he likes to say.</p><p>"Yeah. We have actually been in talks several times to try to... I hate the term spinoff. But they are trying to do other satellite projects off the Wick franchise. Hopefully they'll be good ones," Stahelski said.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/john-wick-director-says-halle-berry-wants-to-come-back/1100-6515036/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Diablo 4 Players Can't Figure Out Why The Resistance Stat Is So Bad

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo IV</a> players are scratching their heads in regards to the game's resistance stat, which according to one content creator, is about 10 times worse than any of the game's other defensive stats.</p><p dir="ltr">Kripparrian, who is known for creating content around Blizzard's ARPG franchise as well as Blizzard's digital card game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hearthstone-heroes-of-warcraft/">Hearthstone</a>, attempts to explain in one of his latest videos. He is playing a Sorceress and has stacked resistances thanks to the main Sorceress stat, Intelligence, also rewarding a bonus to all resistances. In doing so, he has learned that resistances don't seem to compare favorably when it comes to other defensive stats.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">Breaking down the numbers, Kripparrian explains that every other defensive stat in Diablo IV, including armor and damage reduction from close, are vastly superior to stacking resistances. Armor, for example, grants both physical damage reduction and resistances to all elements, whereas pieces of gear typically only have resistance to one particular element. At first glance, a piece of gear that has a 50% elemental resistance roll may seem good. But in reality, it only raises the overall resistance to that element by a few percentage points, and overall offers very little actual damage reduction. A piece of gear with a good plus percent to armor value, on the other hand, raises overall mitigation to every type of damage by a higher percentage.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-players-cant-figure-out-why-the-resistance-stat-is-so-bad/1100-6515033/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr"><em>Animal Crossing: New Leaf is celebrating its 10-year anniversary today, June 9, 2023. Below, we reexamine New Leaf next to the explosive popularity of its successor, New Horizons, and find appeal in the simpler approach.</em></p><p dir="ltr">It's no exaggeration to say that Animal Crossing: New Horizons changed everything for the once-sleepy life simulation series. Thanks in large part to the onset of the pandemic, New Horizons blew past the combined sales of all previous entries just six weeks after release, and it's sold more than 42 million copies so far. But though New Horizons garnered some well-deserved love from critics and fans alike, I've personally put more hours into its 3DS predecessor, New Leaf, which just turned 10 years old, which still stands as the best pure Animal Crossing experience.</p><p dir="ltr">New Leaf is the fourth entry in the Animal Crossing series, and it's fair to say that the game was considered a somewhat conservative evolution of what made the series so good in the first place. Prior to New Horizons, every new entry was essentially more of the same, with a few small twists to keep things interesting. Though that might sound like a criticism, the slow-paced life simulation offered by Animal Crossing doesn't need dramatic shifts to entice fans, especially when they wait a few years between releases.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-i-still-cant-stop-revisiting-animal-crossing-new-leaf/1100-6515011/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-everything-we-know/1100-6492383/">The Elder Scrolls VI</a> is one of the most-anticipated upcoming games across the video game industry, and it's about to reach an anniversary of sorts. The game was officially announced on June 10, 2018 as part of Bethesda's own E3 event that year.</p><p>The announcement trailer didn't reveal much but showed off a massive, sprawling world that fans got pretty excited to learn more about. What fans might not have expected, however, was that five years would pass without Bethesda providing any further significant information. In any event, you can re-watch the original trailer below.</p><p>A lot has changed since The Elder Scrolls VI was announced. Microsoft announced it would acquire Bethesda parent company ZeniMax in September 2020 and closed the deal in March 2021. Because of that, The Elder Scrolls VI is now a Microsoft game, and its exclusivity status has been one of the biggest talking points around the game over the years.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-6-was-announced-5-years-ago-this-week/1100-6515021/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/everything-new-in-fortnite-chapter-4-season-3/1100-6514994/">Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 3</a> has kicked off with a ton of new stuff, including a Transformers crossover that is certain to excite fans of the beloved franchise. In addition to some events around the map and a new Optimus Prime skin in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-chapter-4-season-3-battle-pass-all-skins-emotes-and-other-rewards/2900-4770/">Season 3 Battle Pass</a>, players can get their hands on a powerful Cybertron Cannon to blast away their foes. Here's where to get one and how they work.</p><h2>Where to get a Cybertron Cannon and how it works</h2><p>Cybertron Cannons can be found on the ground or in chests around the island. Although the weapon is Mythic rarity, it's not quite as rare as you'd think, so you should be able to round one up--especially if you're a pretty thorough looter. Cybertron Cannons are a powerful weapon to keep around, so if you manage to come across one, don't pass up the opportunity to add it to your arsenal. It's possible these will have their drop rates nerfed soon, so get in there and enjoy them while you can.</p><figure style="width: 3840px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4150422-fortnite_20230609080210.jpg"><img alt="Cybertron Cannons are extremely powerful, so make sure to pick them up when you see them." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4150422-fortnite_20230609080210.jpg" /></a><figcaption>Cybertron Cannons are extremely powerful, so make sure to pick them up when you see them.</figcaption></figure><p>Cybertron Cannons take a moment to charge, can be fired two times, and they have a 30-second cooldown that ensures you can't spam firing them repeatedly. This is probably a good thing, as each hit with this heavy-hitter does <strong>110 damage</strong>, making it an incredible option for opening an encounter--this will break an enemy's shield and then some. That being said, it's not a particularly good choice for close-quarters combat, so consider SMGs or shotguns at that range.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-where-to-get-a-cybertron-cannon-and-how-it-works/1100-6515020/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Additionally the update replaces Fortnite's bounty boards with the all-new job board, and here's what you need to know about the change.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How job boards work</h2><p dir="ltr">Bounty boards, which were removed from the game back in May, previously let you accept a bounty on another randomly selected player, and eliminating the target within a time limit would reward you with gold. In Season 3: Wilds, bounty boards are replaced with job boards to give you more choices in how you earn your gold.</p><p dir="ltr">Interacting with a job board will give you a choice of three jobs, one of which is still the normal bounty option.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-4-season-3-how-to-use-job-boards-to-earn-gold/1100-6515015/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>John Wick director Chad Stahelski has commented on the ongoing Hollywood writers' strike, saying there is a genuine concern that AI could become problematic.</p><p>"I think the writers are addressing something that people dismiss too easily, which is the AI influence," Stahelski said on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1DLu8ms9Nrjc7a8DRTyDFg?si=8TdjOdfdSt6OYiz35cxBlQ">Joe Rogan Experience podcast</a>.</p><p>Stahelski said some people are asking, "Why are we talking about AI?," adding that the technology is too rudimentary at this point to actually write a good movie. But Stahelski believes the writers' union is right to take a stand because of what could happen in the future.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/john-wick-director-says-ai-is-a-real-concern-for-hollywood-writers/1100-6515013/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1599/15997278/4150180-c4s3battlepasslineup.jpg" /><br /><h3><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> Chapter 4 Season 3: Wilds has arrived, bringing a jungle-themed island to the battle royale. Like other seasons of Fortnite, there is also a brand new battle pass, featuring over 100 different rewards for players to unlock, including a bunch of brand new skins--both Epic originals and a guest character.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>The first skin unlocked in the battle pass is Era</strong>, who appears to be a time traveler, in an all-black outfit that feels at place both in the past and future. <strong>After that is Trace</strong>, who appears to be a wanderer from the future. He has a green jacket with a glowing blue satchel and glowing blue accents on his arms and jackets. <strong>Third is Rian</strong>, who has a punk aesthetic. Her default skin features a red jacket and hat, alongside some red highlights in her hair.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Next up is Relik</strong>, a hunter who has armor made out of what looks like dinosaur bones. It also has lava accents on his shoulder and he has claw hands. His alternate color costume is all black with a mask. <strong>Fifth is Mariposa</strong>, a reinvention of the Dynamo Luchador skin. Mariposa loses the mask in her default skin and instead has pink boxing shorts and a pink jacket, along with green accents. Her alternate skin is inspired by Día de los Muertos.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>After that is Lorenzo</strong>, a charming rogue and adventurer. He has a generic looking adventure outfit, but has some map-themed tattoos. <strong>Following Lorenzo is the Iconic Era</strong> built-in emote, which puts her into a white dress with a large collar. The Timeless Era variant follows that, featuring a light blue color scheme and an optional hat. <strong>Lastly is the Optimus Prime skin</strong>, which features a design closely resembling the latest live-action film, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts.</p><p>To find out what else is new on the island, check out GameSpot's <a

<p>HBO chief content officer Casey Bloys has commented on the future of artificial intelligence in Hollywood, saying he hopes to be retired by the time the AI revolution comes, if it ever does. Speaking to <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/hbo-casey-bloys-ai-writing-shows-succession-casey-bloys-1235636300/">Variety</a>, Bloys started off by reminding people that he grew up in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, a town that was home to gigantic steel companies before some <a href="https://www.lehighvalleylive.com/bethlehem/2023/02/the-15b-deal-that-ended-bethlehem-steel-lehigh-valley-historical-headlines.html">went bankrupt</a> in part because they did not adapt to new trends in business.</p><p>"So I am very, very aware of what happens when a company does not think about the future or is not aware of the future," he said</p><p>Bloys, who has been at HBO for more than 19 years, said HBO operates differently from other media giants. He said he has never tested a pilot to decide whether or not to pick it up to series. "It's just not something we do," he said. For AI, Bloys said he hopes there never comes a day when AI is part of the creative development process.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hbo-boss-wants-no-part-of-ai-revolution-in-hollywood-if-it-ever-happens/1100-6515003/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 3 Start Time: When Will Fortnite Servers Be Back Up?

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-4-season-3-start-date-battle-pass-and-optimus-prime/1100-6514710/">Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 3</a> is starting very soon. In fact, the Fortnite servers are down in anticipation of the new season launch. This scheduled downtime is nothing to worry about. It's merely time for Epic to apply the Chapter 4 Season 3 patch. If you're wondering when you can jump into the game, here's everything you need to know.</p><h2>Fortnite servers down - When does Chapter 4 Season 3 start?</h2><p>Fortnite is currently in scheduled downtime following the end of Chapter 4 Season 2. This means Chapter 4 Season 3 is just around the corner, and with it will come new weapons, a new jungle-themed look for the island, and a new battle pass, among many other things. But none of that matters until the Fortnite servers are letting players back into the game. Epic likes to keep this a surprise, but history suggests Fortnite will be playable again sometime around <strong>4 AM - 7 AM PT / 7 AM - 10 AM ET</strong> on June 9. This three-hour window is our best guess based on having covered many seasons of Fortnite by now, and as always, the actual time is subject to change for a number of reasons.</p><p>For one, downtime is needed to apply the game's latest patch, and patches can be delayed. Even if Epic is shooting for the earliest possible time to launch Chapter 4 Season 3, things can get in the way of that plan. It's also worth noting that most new Fortnite seasons as of late featured a queue system that slowed players' ability to get into the game past the main menu. This is done so Epic can prevent server overload and usher players in at a steady but manageable rate. Given that this next season launches on a weekday, the servers may not be as crowded as they have been lately, with recent seasons arriving on Sundays. Still, if you get stuck in a queue, hang in there and save your spot. You'll get through the line soon enough.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-4-season-3-start-time-when-will-fortnite-servers-be-back-up/1100-6514962/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Diablo 4 - How To Beat The Wandering Death World Boss

<p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4</a> Wandering Death is one of the game's World Bosses. This creepy behemoth, which looks like a giant tree made of bones, has numerous devastating abilities that you need to watch out for. Our Diablo 4 Wandering Death guide discusses this foe's spawn times and abilities.</p><h2>How to Beat Wandering Death in Diablo 4</h2><h3>Wandering Death Spawn Times</h3><p>The Diablo 4 Wandering Death does not have a specific spawn time or location. Rather, it's part of a selection pool along with other World Bosses. Here's how it works:</p><ul><li>Every six hours, a World Boss will spawn in the game.</li><li>The location varies, but it's usually in one of the large, circular arenas. These include Fractured Peaks – The Crucible, Scosglen – Caen Adar, Dry Steppes – Saraan Caldera, Kehjistan – Seared Basin, and Hawezar – Fields of Desecration.</li><li>As of the time of this writing, we've noticed that the World Boss you'll fight tends to be random, so there's no guarantee that you'll see the Wandering Death at a specific timeframe.</li><li>30 minutes before the boss appears, an icon will appear over an arena, notifying all players that a World Boss is about to spawn. That means you should see almost a dozen players running to the same location to partake in the activity.</li><li>Once the fight begins, players have 15 minutes to defeat the creature before it disappears.</li></ul><figure style="width: 1280px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4149265-diablo-4-wandering-death-world-boss-guide-1.jpg"><img alt="We first encountered Wandering Death when it spawned in the Hawezar arena." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4149265-diablo-4-wandering-death-world-boss-guide-1.jpg" /></a><figcaption>We first encountered Wandering Death when it spawned in the Hawezar arena.</figcaption></figure><p> </p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-wandering-death-boss-guide/1100-6514925/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
