The owner, Miles Walker of A OK Walker Autoworks, had infamously paid one of his former employees in 91,500 oil-covered pennies, dumped on his driveway along with a crude note. The Department of Labor filed a lawsuit against Walker, alleging violations of overtime provisions. The court's ruling not only requires Walker to compensate his employees but also forbids him from further discrimination and retaliation.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v75yU6yd8Pg", "date_published": "2023-06-26 18:36:29+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
