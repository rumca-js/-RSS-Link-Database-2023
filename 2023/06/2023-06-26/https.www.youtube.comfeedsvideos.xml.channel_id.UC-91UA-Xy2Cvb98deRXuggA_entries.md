In a shocking case of mistreatment and retaliation, an auto shop owner in Georgia has been ordered to pay $39,934 in back wages and damages to nine former employees. The owner, Miles Walker of A OK Walker Autoworks, had infamously paid one of his former employees in 91,500 oil-covered pennies, dumped on his driveway along with a crude note. The Department of Labor filed a lawsuit against Walker, alleging violations of overtime provisions. The court's ruling not only requires Walker to compensate his employees but also forbids him from further discrimination and retaliation.
