(While also hoping for those ever-elusive Sol Rings.)  \n\nThanks to the generous support of our live chat last week we were able to get 2 full boxes for this second stream of opening packs together!  We'll continue to do this as long as there is interest - all Super Chats will go toward another box if we get enough!\n\n#mtgxlotr #lordoftherings #magicthegathering", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AX4lveeHqKI", "date_published": "2023-06-26 19:12:45+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
