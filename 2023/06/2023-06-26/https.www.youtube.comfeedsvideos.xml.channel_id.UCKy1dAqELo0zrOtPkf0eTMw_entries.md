In only its second week in theaters, DC's The Flash saw a massive drop-off of 72% from its debut weekend. To contrast, Sony's Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse reclaimed the top spot, adding $18 million to its total gross of more than $300 million. The Flash will struggle to recoup its $200 million production budget, having earned a paltry $87 million so far. In other movie news, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director James Mangold isn't too fond of Hugh Jackman donning the Wolverine claws for Deadpool 3. Mangold directed the last Wolverine movie, 2017's Logan, which gave a somber—but fitting—farewell to the X-Man. Deadpool's Ryan Reynolds apparently convinced Jackman to reprise the role in the MCU-adjacent film. And finally, The Witcher producers are confident people won't have a problem seeing Liam Hemsworth as Geralt in a future season of the Netflix show. They're looking to the books as inspiration to justify the change in Geralt's appearance.

## Trepang2 Review

Trepang2 reviewed by Gabriel Moss on PC.

Trepang2 is a delightful tribute shooter that brings the relentless yet intelligent and often creative action of games like F.E.A.R. to the modern standards of 2023. Its diverse enemy encounters and smart level design are top-notch, though it’s less successful when it occasionally dips into lukewarm survival-horror elements, and that’s when it becomes apparent that it could’ve really used a stronger story and better scares. In light of that, it’s wise that it leans harder on action than stealth throughout, often keeping pace with the best first-person shooters when firefights heat up. However, it still ends a bit more quickly than I’d have hoped, even after padding out its length in higher difficulty modes and side missions. Trepang2 feels like a strong prototype for a Trepang3 that pairs this great action with a less paint-by-numbers story and an extended campaign, but in the meantime, I’ll happily go back in and play it all over again with the myriad cheats I’ve already unlocked.

Oscar winner Michel Hazanavicius' remake of Shin’ichirô Ueda’s cult hit One Cut of the Dead follows a director (Romain Duris, L’Auberge Espagnole) charged with making a live, single-take, low-budget zombie flick in which the cast and crew, one by one, actually turn into zombies. Featuring hysterically unhinged performances from Oscar nominee Bérénice Bejo (The Artist), Matilda Lutz (Revenge), and Finnegan Oldfield (Corsage), Final Cut is a sly love letter to the art of filmmaking and a blood-soaked, hilarious genre farce with a meta-to-the-max premise. Kino Lorber will release Final Cut in theaters on July 14.

Here are 49 times Final Fantasy 16 is pretty much just Game of Thrones! FF16 producer Naoki Yoshida has made no secret about drawing inspiration from GoT for the latest epic in the long-running series, but the influence of George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire goes way beyond its British medieval roots. Check out these similarities between FF16 and Game of Thrones and let us know if you spotted any others in the comments.

From FF16 Clive being Jon Snow, to the Iron Kingdom and a Hodor impersonator, here are all the times that we spotted Final Fantasy 16 basically copying Game of Thrones.

Final Fantasy XVI is available now on PS5.

Dave The Diver reviewed by Travis Northup on PC. Available later this year on Nintendo Switch.

Dave The Diver is a tremendous and unforgettable RPG adventure that I can’t put down. The story and characters are full of heart and charm, the underwater exploration and restaurant management are easy to lose time to, and the sheer number of weird minigames and other surprises that are packed in the 30-hour adventure ensure things never grow stale. Even with wimpy bosses, simple puzzles, and a fair number of bugs, Dave The Diver has so many other interesting and intriguing things going on that it’s easily one of the best games I’ve played this year so far.
