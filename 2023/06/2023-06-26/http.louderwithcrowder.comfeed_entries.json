His intention was to raise money to improve postsecondary outcomes for students from underserved backgrounds. Poyer announced he was forced to cancel due to too many sponsors and participants pulling out over the tournament being held at a Trump-owned golf club. Turns out to them, politics matters more than improving postsecondary outcomes for students from underserved backgrounds.</p><p>Poyer made the announcement from his home in Miami, saying he chose Trump National in Doral for no reason other than it's his favorite place to play.</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\"></div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/itsNTBmedia/status/1673331562702577673\"></a>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Unfortunately, the location of the event led to a few sponsors and golfers withdrawing at the last minute due to external pressures. They decided they didn\u2019t want to take part in my tournament in which they took part in last year because of where it\u2019s at, at Trump National Doral in South Florida. ECMC decided they can no longer take the pressure from up top, from the people above them and it probably has nothing to do with ECMC at all.</blockquote><p><a href=\"https://buffalonews.com/sports/bills/bills-safety-jordan-poyer-cancels-charity-golf-event-at-trump-national-doral-after-backlash/article_5a145f2e-12c5-11ee-ac66-3ff53b22fb9f.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Buffalo News reports</a> criticism of the Trump National venue came almost immediately when the event was announced in early June. The ECMC Foundation issued a statement to the paper stating: \u201cECMC Foundation was fortunate to be a beneficiary of Jordan Poyer\u2019s golf tournament in Florida. Although the Foundation was not a sponsor, we have had an excellent partnership with Jordan and we respect his decision to cancel his tournament; we hope he will consider supporting us in his future events.\"</p><p>At the end of the day, Poyer says people couldn't put their egos aside and put politics aside in order to raise money for a charity. And even though Trump himself had nothing to do with this event, the fact his name is on the building was too much for some people.</p><blockquote>I\u2019m not na\u00efve. I understand where [ECMC is] on the political spectrum, where New York is on the political spectrum. Do I agree with a lot of it? No, I don\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t. \u2026 I say the quiet part out loud a lot and some of you don\u2019t like that. My bad. I still went and put my ego aside and went to go help those who needed help or needed a laugh.</blockquote><p>One of those quiet parts said out loud was earlier this year when Poyer said he <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/buffalo-bills-player-jordan-poywer-170736827.html\" target=\"_blank\">wished he played in a state that didn't take 50% of his money away</a>. </p><p>This goes to show you how fueled by hatred the left is, and what big pussies the middle is. It was a charity. A fundraiser. Poyer was looking to raise money to help the less fortunate in his community. The people causing the \"immediate criticism\" cared more about their political feelings than helping people who needed help. And the golfers and sponsors pulled out why? Because people were chirping at them on Twitter?</p><p>I would love to find out what players and sponsors pulled out. They need to get the Bud Light treatment.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

You are going to read about New York City coming after wood and coal-fired ovens. Two days from now, an \"independent\" \"fact\" checker is going to say it's misleading. Then a few months down the road when they think you aren't paying attention, they'll announce it is true.</p><p>We are in phase one of the dance. <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2023/06/25/nyc-rules-crack-down-on-coal-wood-fired-pizzerias-must-cut-carbon-emissions-up-to-75/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=nypost&amp;utm_source=twitter\" target=\"_blank\">A New York Post article on new</a> New York City rules cracking down on coal and wood-fired pizzerias, demanding they cut carbon emissions up to 75%.</p><p>Pizzerias with these ovens made before 2016 will be forced to buy expensive emission control devices while attempting to operate in one of the most expensive cities in America to run a business. Some restaurants might be able to get a waiver if they can prove financial hardship. Being a NYC small business owner doesn't count for one on it's own.</p><p>One restaurateur said anonymously:</p><blockquote>This is an unfunded mandate and it\u2019s going to cost us a fortune not to mention ruining the taste of the pizza totally destroying the product. If you f*ck around with the temperature in the oven you change the taste. That pipe, that chimney, it\u2019s that size to create the perfect updraft, keeps the temp perfect, it\u2019s an art as much as a science. You take away the char, the thing that makes the pizza taste great, you kill it.</blockquote><p>When you cook with wood, it functions as an ingredient. The wood adds to the flavor, not unlike when you BBQ. </p><p>In a statement, NYC DEP spokesman Ted Timbers called this a \"common-sense rule\" that was developed with restaurant groups and whatever the hell \"environmental justice\" groups are.</p><p>You may remember earlier this year how it was reported the Biden Administration <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/gas-stoves-biden\" target=\"_blank\">was considering a gas stove ban</a>. Then the media reported <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/washington-post-gas-stoves\" target=\"_blank\">it was fake news (after reporting it wasn't)</a>. Then months later, <a href=\"https://freebeacon.com/biden-administration/biden-admin-sides-with-liberal-citys-gas-stove-ban/\" target=\"_blank\">it turns out that's exactly what Biden is doing</a>.</p><p>My guess is the journalisming hook will start with \"right-wingers\" being anti-science, and that it \"only\" affects 100 restaurants. For now. California and Chicago are going to try to one-up the City. Then elected officials are going to get involved on a statewide and national level. It wasn't long after that gas stove ban that was never a gas stove ban <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kathy-hochul-gas-stoves\" target=\"_blank\">BECAME a gas stove ban in New York</a>. <br /></p><p>It's all something to keep in mind come election day. These policies are never on the ballot because leftists know how unpopular their agenda is if people ever find out about it. If you don't like food and think everything should be cooked using electricity (until leftists find an excuse to bad that), then, by all means, keep voting Democrat.</p><p>And good luck coming after our BBQ.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

They show up randomly in uniform and fully masked. They protest saying white nationalist things and disappear. The media tries to tie them to Trump supporters. Yet, for a group of offensive masked Nazis, there is a lack of interest in revealing their true identities. Remember, journalisming is <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/cnn-threatens-doxx-anonymous-creator-trumpwwe-gif\" target=\"_blank\">an institution that hunted down an anonymous meme maker because Donald Trump shared it</a>.</p><p>It is because of all these red flags that others will claim PF are actually feds.
