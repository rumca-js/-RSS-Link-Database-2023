There are few institutions in the UK as loved and respected as the NHS. This is much discussed. But far less attention is given to a more unpalatable truth, which is that by international standards, the NHS is rather mediocre. It scores very well on equity (because it is funded by general taxation, and free at the point of use), but in terms of keeping people alive, it is \u201cmore of a laggard than a leader\u201d on many measures, according to a report today from the <strong>King\u2019s Fund</strong>, a health thinktank.</p><p>The King\u2019s Fund has compared health systems in 19 wealthy countries. Here is an extract from <a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/publications/nhs-compare-health-care-systems-other-countries\">its summary</a>.</p><p>The UK has below-average health spending per person compared to peer countries. Health spending as a share of GDP (gross domestic product) was just below average in 2019 but rose to just above average in 2020 (the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, which of course had a significant impact on the UK\u2019s economic performance and spending on health services). The UK lags behind other countries in its capital investment, and has substantially fewer key physical resources than many of its peers, including CT and MRI scanners and hospital beds. The UK has strikingly low levels of key clinical staff, including doctors and nurses, and is heavily reliant on foreign-trained staff. Remuneration for some clinical staff groups also appears to be less competitive in the UK than in peer countries \u2026</p><p>People in the UK receive relatively good protection from some of the catastrophic costs of falling ill. Relatively few core NHS services are charged for and certain population groups are exempt from charges. But financial protection is weaker for some services, such as dental care, and there is growing concern that people in the UK may be forced to choose between funding their own care or enduring longer waits for treatment.</p><p>We approach the 75th anniversary of the foundation of the NHS, I want to ensure that it continues to thrive for the next 75 years and beyond.</p><p>And while we focus on cutting waiting lists in the short term, we must also look to tackle some of the long-term challenges facing the NHS, including lung cancer which costs 35,000 lives every year. Rolling out screening to high-risk 55-74 year olds will save lives by detecting up to 9,000 lung cancers a year at an early stage.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/jun/26/rishi-sunak-nhs-health-keir-starmer-covid-inquiry-uk-politics-live\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/jun/26/rishi-sunak-nhs-health-keir-starmer-covid-inquiry-uk-politics-live", "date_published": "2023-06-26 08:31:17+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "\u2018Quite phenomenal\u2019: Australia\u2019s Jason Belmonte makes more tenpin bowling history", "description": "<ul><li>Player rolls three 300 games on live TV at event in Washington</li><li>Belmonte has 25 300 games in his PBA Tour career</li></ul><p>Australian tenpin bowler Jason Belmonte has further cemented his place in the record books after becoming the first PBA Tour player to roll three perfect 300 games on live TV.</p><p>A 300 game is achieved by scoring a strike in every frame \u2013 the highest score possible in tenpin bowling \u2013 and having one aired live is a goal for most professional bowlers.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/26/quite-phenomenal-australias-jason-belmonte-makes-more-tenpin-bowling-history\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/26/quite-phenomenal-australias-jason-belmonte-makes-more-tenpin-bowling-history", "date_published": "2023-06-26 07:06:13+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "Glastonbury 2023 review: giggly rap on Friday, Smiths covers on Saturday \u2013 and a mystery act that surprised no one", "description": "<p>Arctic Monkeys, Fred Again, Raye, Lana Del Rey and Guns N\u2019 Roses all astounded. And if everyone knew Foo Fighters would turn up, just who might share the stage with Elton John was the stuff of rumours</p><p>This year\u2019s Glastonbury festival site seemed to be as awash with wild speculation as ever. Sunday\u2019s headliner Elton John would supposedly be performing with special guest Britney Spears \u2013 for some reason, a post on Spears\u2019s Instagram account featuring a photograph of a segmented apple was <a href=\"https://www.nme.com/festivals/glastonbury/fans-think-britney-spears-instagram-clues-means-she-headed-to-glastonbury-2023-3460962\">held up as incontrovertible proof that she was boarding a Somerset-bound helicopter</a>. Others were convinced that Elton was going to bring on Harry Styles: after last year, when you could barely walk a few feet without hearing someone sagely informing someone else that Styles was definitely going to turn up on stage with Paul McCartney, or Billie Eilish, or Kendrick Lamar, or perhaps dishing up pad thai in a food stall just south of the Other stage, the former One Direction heart-throb now appears to be a permanent fixture of the Glasto rumour mill. Most lurid of all, there were those who insisted that the final British show of John\u2019s record-breaking farewell tour was going to be enlivened by the spectral appearance of a hologram of the late George Michael.</p><p>Nevertheless, what was supposed to be the weekend\u2019s biggest surprise turned out to be its worst-kept secret. Stories that the mysterious band who appear on Friday afternoon\u2019s Pyramid stage bill as the Churnups are actually Blur or Pulp \u2013 two Britpop heroes currently reformed and playing shows \u2013 have long died out: everyone seems to know <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/23/foo-fighters-secret-glastonbury-set-churnups\">it is actually Foo Fighters</a>, playing more or less the same slot at the festival as they did 25 years ago, when they were making their Glastonbury debut.
