  <p id="J0f7LE">With about a month to go until the next <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/6/23751841/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-summer-2023-july-foldables-z-flip-fold-5">Samsung Galaxy Unpacked event</a>, we may have a pretty comprehensive idea about what to expect from the next version of the Galaxy Z Flip 5 and the Galaxy Z Fold 5. Several leaks over the last few days have revealed a lot about what the phones may look like — and what’s under their respective hoods — ahead of their official unveiling.</p>
<p id="UHatkq">A Twitter leak from <a href="https://twitter.com/Tech_Reve/status/1672838362607271936?s=20">Revegnus</a> on July 25th showed a photo of a folded phone that looks to be to be the Galaxy Z Flip 5 in a blocky, black case (via <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/06/26/galaxy-z-flip-5-price-colors-live-leak/"><em>9to5Google</em></a>). The case hides a lot of the design, but what you can see backs up previous alleged renders. For instance, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/16/23763530/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-leak-render-cover-screen">screen on the back</a> may be the same 3.4-inch 720 x 748 cover screen that’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/4/23710806/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-cover-display-size-resolution-3-4-720-748">been predicted</a>.

  <p id="4aGgxX">Microsoft has been sacrificing growing its Xbox Series X / S sales numbers since launch as a tradeoff for investment in cloud and gaming content. In an internal email exchange between Xbox chief Phil Spencer and Xbox CFO Tim Stuart in December 2020, the pair discussed the reasons behind lower Xbox console volumes. The email has been revealed as part of the <em>FTC v. Microsoft</em> hearing.</p>
<p id="MmcvBI">Spencer admits that Microsoft had a “yield miss for Scarlett,” the codename for Xbox Series X / S consoles, but that it and the delay to Halo Infinite weren’t the “main factors in our console scarcity” during the initial launch period. Microsoft had cut the compute units on its Xbox Series X silicon down to 52 from 56 to improve production yield, but the...</p>

  <p id="Bus2sO">Microsoft’s Xbox Game Studios chief, Matt Booty, was encouraging Xbox CFO Tim Stuart to spend big money on acquiring game content in 2019 to set the company up to battle Sony in subscriptions. The revelation comes in an email thread that’s part of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23768244/ftc-microsoft-activision-blizzard-case-news-announcements"><em>FTC v. Microsoft</em> hearing</a>.</p>
<p id="EB0Ntw">“We (Microsoft) are in a very unique position to be able to go spend Sony out of business,” said Booty, referencing spending $2 billion or $3 billion in 2020 to avoid competitors getting ahead in content at a later date.</p>
<p id="mNSaPt">“It is practically impossible for anyone to start a new video streaming service at scale at this point,” said Booty, referencing competitors like Google, Amazon, and Sony. Booty described content as a moat and that only Sony could really compete...</p>

  <p id="kEF8FS">John B. Goodenough, a professor who played a critical role in the development of the lithium-ion batteries that are now ubiquitous in the devices we rely on every day, died on Sunday, <a href="https://news.utexas.edu/2023/06/26/ut-mourns-lithium-ion-battery-inventor-and-nobel-prize-recipient-john-goodenough/">The University of Texas at Austin announced</a>. He was 100 years old.</p>
<p id="HGbYzh">Goodenough’s key battery breakthrough happened more than 40 years ago. “He and his research team found that by using lithium cobalt oxide as the cathode of a lithium-ion rechargeable battery, it would be possible to achieve a high density of stored energy with an anode other than metallic lithium,” according to the university’s blog post.</p>
<p id="D9By7r">But even though lithium-ion batteries are everywhere — you can find them in things like smartphones, tablets, laptops, video game consoles, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21450916/tesla-battery-pack-elon-musk-price-kilowatt-hour-ev-cost-tabless">even...</a></p>

  <p id="SkgPQX">Two-thirds of North America could face electricity shortages when temperatures spike this summer. The warning came from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=56920">today</a>, which cited an analysis by the nonprofit North American Electric Reliability Corporation.</p>
<p id="S6Oyxn">Most of the Central and Western US, New England, and Ontario, Canada, are at elevated risk, according to the analysis. Energy shortages are a problem when hotter-than-normal summer temperatures cause electricity demand to skyrocket. People crank up their air conditioning, putting greater pressure on the grid. At the same time, extreme heat can make power plants, as well as solar and wind farms, <a href="https://www.iea.org/commentaries/the-world-s-electricity-systems-must-be-ready-to-counter-the-growing-climate-threat">less efficient</a> when it comes to generating electricity.

  <p id="MWhQTv">Netflix has stopped offering its cheapest ad-free tier in Canada, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/26/netflix-quietly-axes-its-basic-plan-in-canada/">as reported earlier by <em>TechCrunch</em></a>. In a statement to <em>The Verge</em>, Netflix spokesperson Kumiko Hidaka confirmed Netflix will no longer offer the $9.99 CAD per month basic plan to new members but says existing subscribers aren’t affected.</p>
<p id="mO80Zj">The removal of Netflix’s basic plan means users in Canada now only have three plans to choose from: the $5.99 CAD / month standard with ads plan, the $16.49 CAD / month standard ad-free plan, and the $20.99 CAD / month premium ad-free tier. At $9.99 CAD per month, the ad-free basic plan helped bridge that gap between Netflix’s ad-supported and more expensive tiers, even if it only let users watch in HD and on one device at a time.</p>

  <p id="Zec3Ei">“Playables” is a new feature in development for YouTube that could add interactive games to the video platform, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/googles-youtube-is-testing-an-online-games-offering-16d1e772"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em> reports</a>. The feature was apparently detailed in an email Google sent to its employees asking them to test it. Games could either be playable via the YouTube app on iOS and Android or through the browser on desktop. </p>
<p id="IsiacQ">The <em>WSJ</em>’s report only contains details on one game the service could include, <em>Stack Bounce</em>, which it describes as “an arcade game in which players attempt to smash layers of bricks with a bouncing ball.” It sounds a little bit like Atari classic <em>Breakout</em> to me, but it’s hard to tell without seeing screenshots.</p>

  <h2 id="g0J4Vk">Who’s using AI?</h2>
<p id="96mDRK">AI is suddenly everywhere. Image generators and large language models are at the core of new startups, powering features inside our favorite apps, and — perhaps more importantly — driving conversation not just in the tech world but also society at large. Concerns abound about cheating in schools with ChatGPT, being fooled by AI-generated pictures, and artists being ripped off or even outright replaced.</p>
<p id="MldTfK">But despite widespread news coverage, use of these new tools is still fairly limited, at least when it comes to dedicated AI products. And experience with these tools skews decidedly toward younger users.</p>

  <p id="YJDJcu">Someone has created a ChatGPT app for Windows 3.1 PCs. <a href="https://www.dialup.net/wingpt/">WinGPT</a> brings a very basic version of OpenAI’s ChatGPT responses into an app that can run on an ancient 386 chip. It’s built by the same mysterious developer behind <a href="https://www.dialup.net/windle/"><em>Windle</em></a>, a <em>Wordle</em> clone for Microsoft’s Windows 3.1 operating system.</p>
<p id="YZsqEG">“I didn’t want my Gateway 4DX2-66 from 1993 to be left out of the AI revolution, so I built an AI Assistant for Windows 3.1, based on the OpenAI API,” says the developer in a<em> </em><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36472854"><em>Hacker News</em> thread</a>.</p>
<p id="EqahQi">WinGPT is written in C using Microsoft’s standard Windows API and connects to OpenAI’s API server using TLS 1.3, so there’s no need for a separate modern PC. That was a particularly interesting part of getting this app running on Windows 3.1, alongside managing...</p>

<p id="C6LzZa">The new awards will bring the total number of zero-emission buses funded by the infrastructure law up to 1,800, which is more than double the number of clean buses on the roads today. That still only represents a fraction of the roughly 60,000 buses that are currently in operation in the US, but officials hailed it as an important step toward updating the nation’s aging transit fleet with an eye toward fighting climate change. </p>
