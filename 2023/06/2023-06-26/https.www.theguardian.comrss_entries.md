## English cricket’s reign of shame exposed with brutal admission of guilt | Jonathan Liew

<p><strong>National Portrait Gallery, London<br /></strong>Eyes of the Storm, which collects McCartney’s pictures taken as the Beatles’ fame went stratospheric, record a pivotal moment in pop culture</p><p>First they were ours, for a brief and precious moment.

Whatever their merits as art, McCartney’s hitherto unseen photos, taken between December 1963 and February 1964, record a pivotal moment in popular culture.</p><p>The sequence of 250 backstage and off-duty images begins at the Liverpool Empire, a triumphant return home for the group during a UK tour reaching its climax at Finsbury Park Astoria in north London, where their 16-night Christmas variety show also features the actor Dora Bryan, recently in the charts with All I Want for Christmas Is a Beatle. Then, early in the new year, come 18 sold-out days and nights at the venerable Olympia music hall in Paris, playing two and sometimes three shows a day to a new generation of <em>yé-yé</em> fans at the top of a bill including acrobats and comedians.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/27/paul-mccartney-photographs-1963-64-review-eyes-of-the-storm-beatles">Continue reading...</a>

<p>New species named Pinanga subterranea as Kew botanists admit they have no idea how its flowers are pollinated</p><p>A new-to-science palm species has been discovered in Borneo with the remarkable ability to flower and fruit underground. How the rare palm – named <em>Pinanga subterranea</em> – has survived is a mystery, as most plants have evolved to develop their flowers and fruit above ground to facilitate pollination and the dispersal of seeds.</p><p>“<em>Pinanga subterranea</em> is the only known species of palm to flower and fruit below ground,” said Dr Benedikt Kuhnhäuser, a future leader fellow at Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, who was part of the research team that collected specimens and ascertained that it was a new species. “Flowering and fruiting below ground is mind-boggling and seemingly paradoxical because they appear to prevent pollination and dispersal. We now know bearded pigs eat and disperse <em>Pinanga subterranea</em>’s fruits, but we’ve yet to find out how and by whom the flowers are pollinated.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/27/mind-boggling-palm-that-flowers-and-fruits-underground-thrills-scientists">Continue reading...</a>

## Rose Ayling-Ellis: Signs for Change review – proof that the hearing world is as prejudiced as ever

<p>The Strictly winner is a wonderful, hopeful presence – but the main takeaway of this courageously honest documentary is how little things have changed for the deaf community in decades</p><p>In my late teens and early 20s, which was the early 90s, I used to work with disabled children. It was a time when, although it was never put in such terms by anyone in authority, the rule of thumb seemed to be that if you had an invisible disability – such as deafness, say – you were expected to fit in with the “normal” world (it was also a time when such quote marks were rarely used). If you had a visible disability, you were expected to keep yourself hidden as much as possible so as not to upset anyone. The one thing both approaches had in common is that they very much weren’t about making the people with disabilities comfortable. Comfort, ease, the ability to move through the world without being made conscious of what you could and couldn’t do? These were the prerogative of “normal” people.</p><p>The main takeaway from Rose Ayling-Ellis: Signs for Change is how little things have changed in the 30 years since – though the existence of this documentary and the public profile of Ayling-Ellis herself shows we may yet hope for progress. Ayling-Ellis is a deaf actor best known for her two-year stint as Frankie in EastEnders, the soap’s first regular deaf character, and for winning 2021’s Strictly Come Dancing (with her hearing aid she can pick up some music, including the beat, in addition to sensing vibrations). She has naturally become a role model and figurehead for the deaf community. One mother, Katie, whose two-year-old son Alvie was diagnosed as deaf at seven weeks, speaks very movingly about what Rose meant to her as she wrestled with the sense of powerlessness the news had given her. “I’d been holding him and singing him to sleep every night. Had he ever even heard me? ... And then, suddenly, there you were – happy, confident, successful.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/26/rose-ayling-ellis-signs-for-change-review-strictly-winner-documentary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ministers are ultimately responsible for weakening the arts and humanities. They are taking the country backwards</p><p>The announcement that the University of East Anglia is to cut 31 arts and humanities posts – out of a total of 36 academic job cuts – has rightly prompted <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ian-mcewan-enduring-ire-university-east-anglia-writing-course-cuts-9gpks9bs3" title="">anger as well as dismay</a>. UEA became a literary flagship among the new universities that opened in the 1960s. This year is its 60th birthday, and since 1970 it has been home to one of the most famous creative writing courses in the world: founded by the novelists Malcolm Bradbury and Angus Wilson, its students have included Anne Enright, Ian McEwan and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/05/kazuo-ishiguro-wins-the-nobel-prize-in-literature" title="">Nobel laureate Kazuo Ishiguro</a>.</p><p>There is shock, among alumni and observers, that the financial problems of the UK’s higher education sector now threaten such prestigious institutions. Once celebrated for their innovative approaches, 1960s campus universities were where different kinds of courses were developed. Creative writing is one example; media, development and women’s studies are others. In cutting the arts and humanities in these universities, managers and policymakers are turning back the clock – at a time when, arguably, there has never been a greater need for courageous innovation. Any idea that the risks are limited to the post-1992 universities should be junked.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/26/the-guardian-view-on-universities-arts-cuts-are-the-tip-of-an-iceberg">Continue reading...</a>

In sharp contrast, British councils <a href="https://www.aamarchives.org/archive/who-was-involved/local-authorities.html" title="">took a stand against apartheid</a> by boycotting South African goods. Mayors around the world signed a declaration calling for the release of the man who would become not only his country’s leader, but a global icon of democracy and justice. These efforts helped to shift public attitudes towards the struggle for freedom.</p><p>In an increasingly globalised world, it seems only logical that local authorities have a <a href="https://jia.sipa.columbia.edu/principles-modern-city-diplomacy-and-expanding-role-cities-foreign-policy" title="">role in international affairs</a>.

<p>HSBC is to vacate its ‘tower of doom’ – can Canary Wharf reinvent itself in the post-pandemic era?</p><p>Farewell to the “tower of doom”, hello to views of St Paul’s. One suspects a majority of the 8,000 inhabitants of HSBC’s 42-storey global head office in Canary Wharf will be delighted by the prospect, in late 2026, of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/26/hsbc-to-move-to-smaller-city-of-london-headquarters-due-to-hybrid-working">a move westwards to a redeveloped former BT building</a> near the cathedral. A sterile life in docklands, as HSBC staffers’ nickname for their office indicates, has never been everybody’s cup of tea.</p><p>For Canary Wharf Group (CWG) – these days jointly owned by Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund and the Canadian developer and property owner Brookfield – HSBC’s looming exit is undoubtedly a blow. While the bank’s building itself isn’t owned by CWG (it was bought by Qatar Investment Authority alone in 2014), the departure of a name that has been on the skyline for two decades sends a signal about the way the wind is blowing in London’s office market.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/jun/26/that-shrinking-feeling-londons-docklands-can-no-longer-bank-on-financial-sector">Continue reading...</a>

<p>England have invigorated Test cricket after being let off the leash but will the public stay with them if they lose at Lord’s?</p><p>It’s time for supporters and management to decide what they want with England going into the second game of the Ashes 1-0 down. If entertainment is the sole criteria, that box has been ticked. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jun/24/ashes-cricket-england-australia-ben-stokes-jonny-bairstow">The first Test was great to watch</a>, and the mentality of the side, their attitude and bravery, was so impressive. It is not just hype: they are invigorating Test cricket and it is wonderful to see these talented players being let off the leash. It is no coincidence that Sky smashed their record viewing figures for the format, as fans enjoyed five days of exciting cricket played on a surface that would surely otherwise have guaranteed a boring draw.</p><p>But whatever Ben Stokes says about this team not being a results-oriented group in my experience supporters, and sportspeople, like to win. And for all the enjoyment of the match they will look back and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jun/20/fine-margins-dictate-outcome-of-ben-stokess-decisions-in-england-defeat">wonder if they always made the right calls</a>. In every team I’ve played in this has been a fun part of being a cricketer: to sit after a game, perhaps with a drink, and discuss the exciting moments, what went well and perhaps what can be improved. I would assume that with the number of backroom staff and the amount of playing experience inside the England dressing-room, they would be open to these sorts of discussions even if outwardly there is a complete lack of introspection: they just double down on everything, no doubts, no remorse.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/26/ben-stokes-brendon-mccullum-australia-england-the-ashes-cricket">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The real legacy of this extended match should be fine cricket featuring the most runs on aggregate in any women’s Test</p><p>An Australian win, a huge match haul of wickets, a turnaround from a day earlier – sure, all significant on the fifth day of the Women’s Ashes Test in Trent Bridge. Significant above all, though, were two words in that previous sentence: fifth day. Finally, a women’s Test was played over the full span that men’s matches enjoy, giving the space to the contest that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/26/england-australia-womens-ashes-test-match-ash-gardner-cricket-report">allowed it to run its course</a>.</p><p>Only once has a women’s match been scheduled over five days, for a standalone game in Sydney in 1992. On that occasion the entire third day was washed out, and Australia won by an innings so might well have wrapped it up in four had that not been the case. Even the anomalous five-match series of 1984-85 had four-day matches. So if we get deeply technical, this was the first women’s Test with play on all five days – and it was a triumph.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jun/26/australia-england-womens-cricket-five-day-test">Continue reading...</a>

American editor who worked with many celebrated authors including Anthony Burgess, Doris Lessing and Joseph Heller<p>Robert Gottlieb, who has died age 92, was the outstanding literary editor of the second half of the 20th century. Among the renowned novelists he worked with were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/17/doris-lessing" title="">Doris Lessing</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/06/toni-morrison-obituary" title="">Toni Morrison</a>, Salman Rushdie, Anthony Burgess, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/12/vs-naipaul-obituary" title="">VS Naipaul</a> and John Cheever, as well as popular successes such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/06/ray-bradbury" title="">Ray Bradbury</a>, Charles Portis, John Lennon and Bob Dylan.</p><p>It was Gottlieb who suggested <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/dec/14/josephheller1" title="">Joseph Heller</a> change the title of Catch-18 to Catch-22, which he thought was funnier, and which he knew would not conflict with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/jun/25/guardianobituaries.books" title="">Leon Uris</a>’ upcoming novel Mila 18 on booksellers’ shelves. And it was Gottlieb who famously worked with Robert Caro to cut 350,000 words from his million-word study of the New York City administrator <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/23/the-power-broker-robert-moses-and-the-fall-of-new-york-robert-caro-review" title="">Robert Moses.

<p>It’s great that Elton John can still wow the crowds – but let’s not pretend he’s opening doors for other older people</p><p>In a media landscape of wall-to-wall mean, where it is considered normal and proportionate to lose your nut over an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jun/23/child-identifying-as-cat-controversy-from-a-tiktok-video-to-media-frenzy">imaginary teenager who wants to identify as a cat</a>, or whip yourself into a fury that some stranger, somewhere, doesn’t eat dairy, there is one personal remark that is off-limits: you can’t call anyone too old to do a thing because it’s none of your damn business. Two men in their 70s and 80s, battling it out for the US presidency, one of them potentially from prison? Good on them. Ready to settle down with that one special person (again), at 92? Lovely news. What better time to play Glastonbury than when you’re pushing 80 and your first tour was equidistant, in years, between now and the third battle of Ypres?</p><p>It is considered more than rude to mention it – déclassé, suburban.

You are allowed to say <em>that, </em>you’re allowed to say maybe it wasn’t his day, but you’re not allowed to say maybe his greatest set is behind him. Maybe step back a bit, give some young bucks a chance.

<p>Readers offer solutions to rising interest rates and mortgage costs</p><p>How very apt to compare the rises in interest rates on mortgages with other European countries (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jun/20/mortgage-cost-rises-just-dont-happen-here-how-other-countries-compare-with-the-uk" title="">Report, 20 June</a>). In any other aspect of life, taking on a loan when you do not know what the future repayments will be would be very bad financial practice. Yet when homebuyers take on what is likely to be by far their biggest loan, the best they can hope for is a fixed term of two or, at best, five years – thereafter they are at the mercy of the financial markets and government policy. Why? The mortgage company does not need to raise more cash for their loan, so raising the interest rate during the term of a mortgage seems to be out-and-out profiteering.</p><p>A fixed-term, 30-year mortgage seems to be far more sensible, and gives homeowners confidence and security. When will we start adopting a system that is fair to all?<br /><strong>Tom Carr</strong><br /><em>Newcastle upon Tyne</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/26/heres-how-we-can-stop-britains-inflation-nightmare">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Composer Philip Venables and director Ted Huffman’s previous shows have caused panic attacks. How will The Faggots &amp; Their Friends Between Revolutions go down? Ahead of its premiere, the duo talk f-words, love-ins and the capitalist patriarchy</p><p></p><p></p><p>P<a href="https://philipvenables.com/">hilip Venables</a> – nose ring, shaved head, black hoodie – is prancing in one corner of the rehearsal studio like a marionette yanked around by an unseen puppeteer. It is all part of the British composer’s efforts to convey to the 15-strong company the desired tempo for this section of his score for <a href="https://factoryinternational.org/whats-on/the-faggots-and-their-friends-between-revolutions/">The Faggots &amp; Their Friends Between Revolutions</a>, which premieres at the Manchester international festival next week. Adapted from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Faggots_%26_Their_Friends_Between_Revolutions">Larry Mitchell</a>’s underground manifesto-cum-fable, published in 1977 and inspired by the author’s experiences of queer communal living, it is set in the land of Ramrod, where the tyrannical patriarchy (the men) is mocked, defied and plotted against by the faggots and their friends, who include the faeries, the faggatinas and the women who love women. Through their solidarity, they find the strength, as well as the silliness, to endure and overwhelm their oppressors.</p><p>Venables’ impromptu display works so well that the show’s musical director, <a href="https://yshani.co.uk/">Yshani Perinpanayagam</a>, who is padding around in socks with the word “Fuck” on the soles, asks him to demonstrate how the next section should sound. By the end of the afternoon, the densely layered music has acquired a grinding relentlessness. Director Ted Huffman, whose previous collaborations with Venables include an opera based on Sarah Kane’s gruelling final play <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/25/448-psychosis-review-sarah-kane-philip-venables-opera">4:48 Psychosis</a>, sits everyone down on the floor for a debriefing. “I can see you all starting to glaze over,” he says. “So I wanted to reassure you that the piece is built that way, metaphor-wise, to show what it’s like to live in the men’s world. Next week, we’ll move on to the lighter, gentler part.” With that, the performers disperse, clutching their various instruments: accordion, cello, violin, lute.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/26/faggots-friends-revolution-manchester-queerest">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Russian leader’s grip on power relies on fossil fuels and unchecked capitalism – we can all exploit these vulnerabilities</p><p>Yevgeny Prigozhin’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/25/prigozhins-march-on-moscow-chronology-of-an-attempted-coup">aborted insurrection</a> against Vladimir Putin made for popcorn-gobbling viewing, full of social media twists and turns, as Russia’s generous collection of war criminals challenged one another. It was tempting to just sit back and gawp as Russia’s “great power” image was reduced to the photo of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB-ruMsX78E">tank in Rostov-on-Don</a> seemingly stuck at the gates to the city circus. But we are not passive observers of this show: each of one of us influences its ultimate outcome.</p><p>Putin appears weaker than ever – and for a ruler who relies on projecting strength, that’s a bad look. To further dull Putin’s fading aura of invincibility, and to ultimately lead to a reversal of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, we need to undermine the pillars his strongman myth is based on: colonial conquest, unregulated capitalism and climate abuse. As questions are raised about his ability to rule, Putin will claim that despite the efforts of the nefarious “collective west”, the Russian economy can stabilise because the world needs Russian fossil fuels; that the need of western companies to make money in Russia means it will never be truly isolated; that for all his blunders on the battlefield, he can still hold on to swathes of Ukraine and its resources, which he will dole out between the Russian system’s stakeholders for whom the risk of sticking with Putin will thus still be smaller than the risk of going against him.</p><p>Peter Pomerantsev is a senior fellow at SNF Agora Institute, Johns Hopkins University</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/26/yevgeny-prigozhin-vladimir-putin-west-russia-fossil-fuels">Continue reading...</a>

For a while it looked like this would be 3D, but the resurgence soon fizzled out. Other advances, like Cineworld’s Screen X and 4DX, are hampered by the dual facts that they cost too much money and make it impossible to snooze through the boring bits.</p><p>So congratulations to Netflix, whose tireless research and development department has finally landed on the Big New Thing.

<p>The Danish director of Bronson and Pusher is to ‘reimagine’ Enid Blyton’s stories for a ‘progressive new audience’. Does this mean Anne will vomit up an eyeball? </p><p>There is a thread on the Enid Blyton Society’s online forum, in which various members of the society attempt to explain the appeal of the Famous Five books. For the most part, they do a wonderful job, pointing out the spirit of adventure that runs through them, the complexity of George, the moral clarity of the characters and the sense of escapism that must have seemed even more abundant when they were read during the bleak postwar years. The books, the thread claims, are good clean old-fashioned wholesome fun.</p><p>But what of the rest of us? The readers who aren’t members of the Enid Blyton Society, who aren’t automatically predisposed to love the Famous Five books? Those of us who have long been disappointed that none of the books ended with Julian discovering that his mother had been fatally stabbed in the throat by a gangster, and reacting by slicing open her abdomen and placing his hands inside her womb in a gory yet gratuitously over-literal metaphor?

## Lewis Capaldi’s Glastonbury set displayed the best of the human spirit – and put disability centre-stage | Frances Ryan

<p>In his moment of triumph, his disabilities visible, the crowd loved him. If only society was always so accepting of difference</p><p>Glastonbury “moments” do not typically involve silence. On Saturday night, Lewis Capaldi changed that. There were no surprise guests, no wild costumes, nor any clever covers. At times towards the end of his Pyramid stage set, Capaldi himself wasn’t even singing. But the silence was filled – by the sound of a hundred thousand people coming together to sing the words for him.</p><p>If you didn’t see the set, Capaldi – who has spoken previously about having Tourette syndrome and anxiety – had problems with his voice throughout and was visibly affected by tics (involuntary movements or sounds). He gave a stellar performance <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/24/lewis-capaldi-at-glastonbury-review">full of heart and humour</a>, but as the hour went on, it was clear he was struggling. “I’m going to be honest everybody but I’m starting to lose my voice up here, but we’re going to keep going … until the end,” he said. “I just need you all to sing with me as loud as you can if that’s OK?” The crowd did not let him down. By the time his mega-hit Someone You Loved began and his voice had all but gone, the audience had taken over, singing the lyrics back to him. Capaldi simply stood on stage taking it in: a sea of smiling faces stretching as far as the eye could see, thousands of voices singing in unison.</p><p>Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/26/lewis-capaldis-glastonbury-set-disability-centre-stage">Continue reading...</a>

The difference is that race is an unspoken subtext here, completely submerged somewhere inside the atmosphere of dissociated trauma.</p><p>Tobi King Bakare plays William, adopted child of Richard (Sightseers’ Steve Oram), who emerges wheelchair-bound and mute from a coma after an unspecified accident. He returns home to complete his physical and mental recovery, afflicted by white-hot flashbacks to speeding roads.

<p>Oven-baked tomato rice with butter beans, and rice pancakes made with rice cooking water and served with stir-fried vegetable rice and a peanut sauce</p><p>Short-grain rice is the squat, stubby cousin of the rice family, and it tends to be starchier than its bigger siblings, which means it can clump and stick together, especially when cooked by the absorption method. That makes it great for turning into a crisp stir-fry or rice balls or sushi; the starch also helps if you want to make creamy dishes such as rice pudding and risotto. However you use it, though, short-grain rice is a hugely handy store-cupboard staple because of its sheer versatility, taking you from savoury to sweet.</p><p>Rosie Sykes is a chef and food writer. Her next book, Every Last Bite: 70 Recipes to Save Time, Money and Resources, will be published by Quadrille next year.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/26/budget-short-grain-rice-recipes-pancake-stir-fried-vegetables-tomato-butter-beans-rosie-sykes">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Christine Dawood said Suleman, 19, was ‘so excited’ and planned to break a Rubik’s cube world record</p><p>The mother of the teenager who died on the Titan submersible has said she gave up her place to her son “because he really wanted to go”. <br /><br />Suleman Dawood, 19, and his father Shahzada, 48, were among five people who died when the vessel imploded on a journey to view the wreck of the Titanic.<br /><br />Christine Dawood told the BBC the original trip had been scheduled before the pandemic and said her son had been disappointed that he was not old enough to accompany them.<br /><br />She said: “It was supposed to be Shahzada and I going down. I stepped back and gave the place to Suleman because he really wanted to go.”<br /><br />Asked how she felt about the decision, she replied: “Let’s just skip that.”<br /><br />She said “both of them were so excited” and her son had taken a Rubik’s Cube with him because he wanted to break a world record.<br /><br />Dawood said her son loved the puzzle so much that he carried it with him everywhere and could solve it in 12 seconds. He planned to solve the puzzle 3,700m below sea by the remains of the Titanic.<br /><br />The family boarded the Polar Prince, the sub’s support vessel, on 18 June – Father’s Day – anticipating the trip of a lifetime. Dawood and her 17-year-old daughter Alina were still onboard when word came through that communications with Titan had been lost.<br /><br />She said: “We all thought they are just going to come up so that shock was delayed by about 10 hours or so. There was a time … when they were supposed to be up on the surface again and when that time passed, the real shock, not shock but the worry and the not so good feelings started.<br /><br />“We had loads of hope, I think that was the only thing that got us through it … We talked about things that pilots can do like dropping weights, there were so many actions people on the sub can do in order to surface. We were constantly looking at the surface. There was so many things we would go through where we would think ‘it’s just slow right now, it’s slow right now’.”<br /><br />She said she “lost hope” when 96 hours had passed since her husband and son boarded the submersible, which indicated they had run out of oxygen. At that point, she sent a message to her family saying she was “preparing for the worst”.<br /><br />Her daughter remained hopeful until the call with the US Coast Guard when they were informed debris had been found, she said.<br /><br />The family returned to St John’s in Newfoundland, Canada, on Saturday, and on Sunday held a funeral prayer for Shahzada and Suleman.<br /><br />Dawood said she and her daughter had vowed to learn to finish the Rubik’s Cube in Suleman’s honour and she intended to continue her husband’s philanthropic work.<br /><br />She said: “He was involved in so many things, he helped so many people and I think Alina and I really want to continue that legacy and give him that platform.</p><p>“Alina and I said we are going learn how to solve the Rubik’s Cube. That’s going to be a challenge for us because we are really bad at it but we are going to learn it.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/26/mother-of-teenager-who-died-on-titan-sub-said-she-gave-her-place-to-son">Continue reading...</a>

<p>First it was fat, now sugar. In the absence of proper policy, ‘the war on obesity’ always needs something – or someone – to blame for its failures</p><p>In the early 2010s, the “war on obesity” found a new enemy: sugar. That role had been filled by dietary fat, but a growing understanding of “healthy fats” led to a partial rehabilitation – and, therefore, a vacancy. Amid stories of “benefit scroungers” and austerity’s hit to public services, sugar – with its connotations of greed, laziness, “empty calories”, sinful enjoyment – was the perfect candidate. And so were born the caricatures of armchair-bound, sugar-fuelled fat people that litter the anti-sugar domain.</p><p>Its position in the public imagination as the primary cause of ill health and obesity was cemented by the declaration of Action on Sugar’s founder member Simon Capewell in 2014 that “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jan/09/obesity-campaign-cut-sugar-processed-foods">sugar is the new tobacco</a>”. Ever since, sugar has found itself the subject of a raft of newspaper articles, popular science books, self-help guides and national and international policies. This outbreak of “sugar talk” reached a frenzied peak in the UK in 2016 with the announcement of plans to introduce the soft drinks industry levy (“<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/16/budget-2016-george-osborne-sugar-tax-mixed-response">sugar tax</a>”), maintaining momentum well past the launch of the tax in 2018 and into the pandemic.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/26/sugar-scapegoat-society-ills-austerity-cost-of-living-crisis">Continue reading...</a>

## American soldiers are getting fire-resistant ‘tactical bras’? I’d settle for one that fit properly | Emma Beddington

<p>Bras are evolving, they say. But after three decades of disappointment I’m running out of patience</p><p>Having read in last week’s <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/06/26/is-the-armys-new-tactical-bra-ready-for-deployment">New Yorker</a> that the US army has a new, exhaustively tested bra for female combatants, I’m interested, of course. The Army Tactical Bra, which is fire-resistant and designed to “reduce the cognitive burden on the wearer” is the fruit of quizzing 18,000 female soldiers on their bra experiences, and crafted in collaboration with a range of cantilevering experts. It’s far too confidential for much brass tacks information to be divulged but I did learn the model the journalist tried (there are four in total) had a zip fastening, and she felt “cozily swaddled”. A little disappointing: I’d hope for a concealed dagger, cyanide capsules and Kevlar at the least – something Q might whip out if Bond had a bust.</p><p>But I’m used to bra disappointment. Like most women, I have measured out my life in brutally unsatisfactory cups. The “cognitive burden” is real: I’ve gone almost the full Kübler-Ross curve attempting to find satisfactory underpinnings. There were the expensive, self-deluding “fashion” bra years of sadly trying to shove myself into inadequate triangles of fancy fabric that create a horrifying quadraboob. Then when I moved to London in my 20s, I took myself hopefully to Rigby &amp; Peller (corsetières to her late Maj until owner June Kenton’s memoir <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/11/queens-bra-fitter-rigby-peller-loses-royal-warrant-tell-all-book">reportedly caused palace displeasure</a>, though come on, who could resist titling something Storm in a D-Cup?). I hoped to find something non-hideous in my non-standard size and remember tentatively holding up pretty fragments of lace and silk for the fitting expert, who wordlessly exchanged them for something sturdily beige. Decades of further crushed hopes followed, from orthopaedic-looking and instantly grey nursing bras to slippery straps and expensive Italian engineering, which much like the car equivalent, turned out to be all style and no substance.</p><p>Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/26/american-soldiers-are-getting-fire-resistant-tactical-bras-id-settle-for-one-that-fits-properly">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The first few months were hard, but I finally  made my peace with that little bundle of untrained energy. I think it will make me a better mother</p><p>Almost as soon as we adopted Troy, an adorable-looking brindle puppy, I felt I’d made a terrible mistake. My husband Louis – a chef – was always working during that bleak January in 2021. Troy, meanwhile, was turning out to be very different from the little beagle-shar pei cross the Manhattan shelter had led us to expect. Not only was he shaping up to be far bigger than the promised 30-40lb, he was murderously energetic. Early on, puppies aren’t allowed outside and there was nowhere for that energy to go. I found myself entertaining Troy all day long, in an apartment you could walk the length of in less than 10 seconds. I frequently hid from him in the bathroom, if my husband hadn’t got there first.</p><p>Troy constantly tested my will. Once, he stole my last slice of pizza from the fridge. After chasing him round the flat with a slipper and <a href="https://www.rspca.org.uk/adviceandwelfare/pets/dogs/environment/crates">locking him in his crate</a>, I realised how woefully unprepared I was for dog parenting, how I let my temper get the better of me.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/26/the-pet-ill-never-forget-troy-the-puppy-stole-my-pizza-shamed-me-and-showed-me-how-much-i-could-love">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Horror-thriller is a confusing mashup of science, religion and spiritualism, cursed with a sloppy script and bad acting</p><p>This horror-thriller occupies the same Victorian shadowlands as The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/may/19/compelling-seductive-horror-have-you-been-watching-penny-dreadful">Penny Dreadful</a>; a not-quite-modern epoch, with its zesty mashup of science, religion and spiritualism, retrofuturist tech and plain retro beliefs. It makes an invigorating backdrop for Irish director Stephen Hall’s second feature. But his script isn’t quite sharp enough and – apart from John Rhys-Davies, who goes at his role with his customary fiery traction, and villain Richard Brake, as ever exploiting a face like an open grave – too many of the supporting cast fall into the distinctly ordinary bracket, acting-wise.</p><p>We open with the bobbies bursting in on London’s most-wanted serial killer: William Colcott (Brake), about to dispatch another victim in a long string he is apparently offering up in an occult attempt to resurrect his dead wife. Banged up in Bishopsgate prison, he becomes the first British recipient of the electric chair. Postmortem photographer Frederick (Rhys-Davies) and his niece assistant Emma (Elena Delia) are called to record the cadaver. But, already rattled in the dead murderer’s presence, she spots a strange anomaly in one of the prints, which coincides with unholy stirrings inside Bishopsgate’s walls that cause the authorities to preemptively call in Father Matthews (David Pearse).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/26/the-gates-review-retrofuturist-tale-of-serial-killers-spirit-on-the-rampage">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Chunky courgettes braised with tomato and onion, to be wolfed down with garlic toasts and perhaps a chunk of feta</p><p>The other day, I chatted to a friend while she cut up zucchini (although they will always be courgettes to me) – a dark-green variety with tiny, white speckles called <em>nero di Milano</em>. One by one, she held the courgettes across the palm of her left hand, close enough that the round end pressed into her yellow T-shirt. Then, using a small, barely serrated knife with a plastic handle, she lopped off the stalk before slicing the courgette first lengthways, then, holding the two halves, across so half-moons dropped straight into the frying pan.</p><p>It was cutting: nothing special, and yet it was special, personal and spare; no chopping board or surface needed, nothing to wash or wipe. We talked about this, and she laughed like a drain at how, like her dad, her aim was “as little washing up as possible”. Her dad’s daughter, she also loves great wine, cheap crisps, football and developed early-onset arthritis in her 30s – or, as she describes it, “drunk hands and creaky fingers” – which gets harder and harder to ignore with every passing year. “I always hated sharp knives anyway! Straight edges, too. And uneven pieces taste better, anyway,” she said while picking up another courgette and pressing it into her stomach. “In a few years, I’ll be using a hammer.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/26/braised-courgettes-tomato-onion-garlic-toast-recipe-rachel-roddy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Artificial intelligence can’t replace human professionals but it could transform the way they treat diseases such as cancer, and save lives</p><ul><li>Mihaela van der Schaar is director of the Cambridge Centre for AI in Medicine at the University of Cambridge</li></ul><p>From the soaring costs of US healthcare to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/22/nhs-crisis-existential-risk-for-the-government">recurrent NHS crisis</a>, it can often seem that effective <em>and</em> affordable healthcare is impossible. This will only get worse as chronic conditions grow in prevalence and we discover new ways to treat previously fatal diseases. These new treatments tend to be costly, while new approaches can be hard to introduce into healthcare systems that are either resistant to change or fatigued by too much of it. Meanwhile, growing demand for social care is compounding funding pressure and making the allocation of resources even more complicated<strong>.</strong></p><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is often glibly posed as the answer for services that are already forced to do more with less. Yet the idea that intelligent computers could simply replace humans in medicine is a fantasy. AI tends not to work well in the real world. Complexity proves an obstacle. So far, AI technologies have had little impact on the messy, inherently human world of medicine. But what if AI tools were designed specifically for real-world medicine – with all its organisational, scientific, and economic complexity?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/26/ai-personalise-medicine-patient-lab-health-diagnosis-cambridge">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Spanning just a few dramatic days, the foreign reporter’s riveting account of the battle for Voznesensk highlights the weaknesses of Putin’s invasion and the courage of Ukrainians</p><p>When Russian troops approached the small farming town of Voznesensk, they were not expecting a battle. A week earlier, Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine had begun. An armoured column trundled insouciantly across a landscape of southern fields and villages. The goal was to capture a crossing point between two rivers. From there the Russians would roll to Odesa, the twinkling Black Sea port.</p><p>Standing in the way of this mighty army was a motley group of Ukrainian defenders. They included a few soldiers and 30 home guard volunteers. Most had never held a gun before. Some were pensioners. Their weapons were a box of grenades, AK-47s and NLAW anti-armour missiles, supplied by the British. The odds looked hopeless. The enemy arrived with helicopters and armoured personnel carriers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/26/a-small-stubborn-town-by-andrew-harding-the-war-in-ukraine-in-skilful-miniature">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This film tells the story of concrete slabs that have been rehomed thousands of miles away in bizarre yet unremarkable locations</p><p>Tracking down various segments of the Berlin Wall scattered all over the US, this eccentric yet down-to-earth documentary from Courtney Stephens and Pacho Velez traces how a historic artefact can mutate and splinter into myriad meanings. Transformed by their surroundings as well as the film-makers’ gaze, these concrete slabs are more than a symbol of the cold war; they have come to represent something quintessentially American.</p><p>From the midwest to California, state department halls to roadside restaurants, chunks of the wall can be found in the most unlikely of places. Most often positioned as a commemoration of history – and that loaded concept of “freedom” – the fragments are occasionally entirely untethered from their context, re-erected decoratively inside a Microsoft office or in the home of a private collector.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/26/the-american-sector-review-us-road-trip-to-hunt-down-remnants-of-the-berlin-wall">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It’s hard to admit, but I was using others’ tragedies as a way of protecting myself. Then a merchandising ad stopped me short</p><p>I vividly remember being a child, sitting on the edge of my parents’ bed late in the evening, and watching Crimewatch. Reconstructions of violent crimes I didn’t understand, usually against women, played out on screen. I remember sombre presenters such as Nick Ross and Kirsty Young pleading for information as grainy CCTV footage showed victims being followed through the streets at night, and dour police detectives talking through timelines of the hours before someone was killed.</p><p>This fascination with the morbid flowed easily into horror movies. After finishing school, I had my first major depressive episode, involving a hospital stay. It took a while for me to get back to myself; I didn’t really leave the house apart from to go to therapy, and I soon became a strange nocturnal hermit. During the day I would sleep, and at night I would lie in bed and watch scary movies where horrible things happened to female actors, fake-slaughtered in buckets of corn syrup.</p><p>Mollie Goodfellow is a freelance journalist and comedy writer</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/26/grisly-true-crime-stories-merchandise">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In this passionate and timely if sometimes tetchy study, the cultural critic argues that Britain should consider race from its own perspective rather than adopt America’s battles</p><p>A year ago, I opened a respected British journal and read that I was Black. Specifically, I was, it turned out, a Black historian. Who knew? Until then, I was simply known as a historian. The editor was dismayed when I complained about not wanting to be racialised in this way; he imagined I’d be delighted with the capitalisation and upgrade from black to Black. Finally, he apologised, saying he’d been badly advised.</p><p>The advice had come from the US. It is just this kind of cultural cringe to the US, and the notions it exports to these shores, that sits at the heart of <em>This </em><em>Is </em><em>Not America</em>, Tomiwa Owolade’s timely intervention into the politics of identity. Owolade contends that Britain continues to cede authority to the US, especially in matters of race, and is blind to what should be obvious: we are not America. <br /><br />Britain’s problems with race pale beside the awful day-to-day enmity in the US. Increasingly, though – with the murder of George Floyd, the adoption of acronyms such as Bicop (Black, Indigenous and People of Colour), the capitalisation of Black and White, the rise, fall and rise again of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement">Black Lives Matter</a>, and the mass incarceration of African American men — insights from across the Atlantic are embraced. This is tied up with the allure of America generally, believes Owolade. Which is undoubtedly true: even today British newspapers are more likely to genuflect in front of an African American than a black Briton.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/26/this-is-not-america-by-tomiwa-owolade-review-why-black-lives-in-britain-matter">Continue reading...</a>

They looked around online but couldn’t find one. “We thought: ‘We’ve got this little pension pot saved. Why don’t we invent the Rainbow Lottery?’” In June 2021, Gattos, who was 70, announced the first set of winning numbers.</p><p>Two years on, the Rainbow Lottery has amassed more than 1,700 players, signed up 150 good causes to support, and raised more than £100,000 a year for everything from the Terrence Higgins Trust to local Pride groups.

<p>I’d never realised how bland life is without dogs, or experienced the joys of a lagerita. It’s amazing what you discover when you spend the weekend with 200,000 strangers</p><p>Sure, sure, it’s hot, and you’re not going to shower, and this will force some choices at Glastonbury that you wouldn’t make in regular life: shorter shorts, for instance, or a hat. This doesn’t even come close to explaining the wild precision, the carefully coordinated flamboyance of festival outfits. Imagine every fabric that you rarely see on public transport – fur, feathers, sequins, crinkly leatherette, chiffon, lace, spandex, mesh, dust – dye it all pink, stick 17 blokes in the same look and glitter all their faces, and you are somewhere near an average posse. They’ll have some personal discretion, of course, in the matter of whether to have a parasol or a hat made of umbrella. Maybe I’m wrong, but I feel like anyone who needs dressing-up days at all needs them more often than once a year.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/26/perv-o-shine-and-sleep-vaping-23-things-i-learned-about-the-world-and-myself-at-glastonbury-2023">Continue reading...</a>

While some of the state’s 35 to 40 million women will still need permission to use public transport, they won’t need to ask for funds to cover the cost of a ticket.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/26/ticket-to-freedom-free-bus-rides-for-women-spark-joy-for-millions-in-karnataka">Continue reading...</a>
