Justin and I will each open a Collector Box LIVE and see who ends up with the best cards!  (While also hoping for those ever-elusive Sol Rings.)  

Thanks to the generous support of our live chat last week we were able to get 2 full boxes for this second stream of opening packs together!  We'll continue to do this as long as there is interest - all Super Chats will go toward another box if we get enough!
