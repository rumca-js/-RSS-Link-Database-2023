To contrast, Sony's Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse reclaimed the top spot, adding $18 million to its total gross of more than $300 million. The Flash will struggle to recoup its $200 million production budget, having earned a paltry $87 million so far. In other movie news, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director James Mangold isn't too fond of Hugh Jackman donning the Wolverine claws for Deadpool 3. Mangold directed the last Wolverine movie, 2017's Logan, which gave a somber\u2014but fitting\u2014farewell to the X-Man. Deadpool's Ryan Reynolds apparently convinced Jackman to reprise the role in the MCU-adjacent film. And finally, The Witcher producers are confident people won't have a problem seeing Liam Hemsworth as Geralt in a future season of the Netflix show. They're looking to the books as inspiration to justify the change in Geralt's appearance.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R__NQDQLIuE", "date_published": "2023-06-26 22:25:15+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Riot Games - Official Soul Fighter Event Trailer", "description": "Riot Games has announced 'Soul Fighter' a cross-game summer event for League of Legends, Teamfight Tactics, Wild Rift, and Legends of Runeterra.

Its diverse enemy encounters and smart level design are top-notch, though it\u2019s less successful when it occasionally dips into lukewarm survival-horror elements, and that\u2019s when it becomes apparent that it could\u2019ve really used a stronger story and better scares. In light of that, it\u2019s wise that it leans harder on action than stealth throughout, often keeping pace with the best first-person shooters when firefights heat up. However, it still ends a bit more quickly than I\u2019d have hoped, even after padding out its length in higher difficulty modes and side missions. Trepang2 feels like a strong prototype for a Trepang3 that pairs this great action with a less paint-by-numbers story and an extended campaign, but in the meantime, I\u2019ll happily go back in and play it all over again with the myriad cheats I\u2019ve already unlocked.\n\n#IGN #Gaming", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXnnCtwxvLw", "date_published": "2023-06-26 17:28:20+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Fortnite - Official Winter\u2019s Trickster Progressive Legacy Set Trailer", "description": "Fortnite has launched the new Winter\u2019s Trickster Progressive Legacy Set into the game as an exclusive reward for Fortnite Crew Subscribers.
