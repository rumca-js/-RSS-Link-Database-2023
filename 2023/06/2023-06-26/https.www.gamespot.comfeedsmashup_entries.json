The email, which was sent in December 2019, explains Microsoft's aggressive acquisition plans, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-considered-buying-sega-niantic-and-bungie-to-bolster-game-pass-and-mobile-business/1100-6515498/\">which almost resulted in the company purchasing Sega, Niantic, and Bungie</a>.</p><p>In the email, first shared by <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/26/23774547/microsoft-sony-xbox-internal-emails-ftc-out-of-business\">The Verge</a>, Booty writes, \"We (Microsoft) are in a very unique position to go spend Sony out of business. If we think that video game content matters in 10 years, we might look back and say, 'Totally would have been worth it to lose $2B or $3B in 2020 to avoid a situation where Tencent, Google, Amazon, or even Sony have become the Disney of games and own most of the valuable content.\"\"</p><p>Booty went on to explain how it is \"practically impossible\" for a company to start a new streaming service due to Disney's competitive holdings, before drawing a comparison between video streaming services and the future of the games industry:</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-strategy-to-spend-sony-out-of-business-revealed-in-2019-internal-email/1100-6515501/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-strategy-to-spend-sony-out-of-business-revealed-in-2019-internal-email/1100-6515501/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-06-26 22:47:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "The Best Pokemon TCG Deals - Booster Boxes, Elite Trainer Boxes, And More", "description": "<p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1702/17023653/4157734-paldeafeature%281%29.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Pokemon cards have seen a massive evolution over the years.

To get fans ready for the film's extensive roster of wildly drawn characters, though, Paramount has released a bunch of character posters to make sure you know what to expect when you walk into theaters. The turtles are here, along with a bunch of notable human and mutant characters, and a massive selection of huge stars.</p><p>The film, which was co-written and produced by Seth Rogen, made some exciting casting choices for the various non-turtle characters in the movie, with familiar faces like John Cena, Rose Byrne, Ice Cube, Ayo Edebiri, Giancarlo Esposito, and so many more lending their voices to the project. Interestingly, though, no celebrities were cast as the titular Ninja Turtles. Instead, all four party dudes are played by actual teenagers--a first for the franchise.</p><p>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem hits theaters on August 2, pitting the four turtle brothers against a gang of criminal mutants that are causing all sorts of trouble. Along the way, they make a new friend in April O'Neil (Edebiri), get more acclimated with the world outside of their sewer dwelling, and of course goof off. They are teenagers, after all. How many times do you think they reference Fortnite?

In the case of Pikmin 4, the fourth entry in a relatively niche franchise (by Nintendo standards) that mixes strategy and puzzle elements, the company seems especially keen to prove it's an entry point for new fans. This was a point made explicitly during a presentation at a recent hands-on demo, and more importantly, it's woven into the fabric of the game itself.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">For starters, the story is no longer following the travails of Captain Olimar. As detailed in a recent trailer and in the game, this time you actually take charge of your own explorer, a custom-created character. While the hands-on didn't include the character-creator section, the pre-fab characters were noticeably imbued with the off-kilter, Charlie Brown-esque cartoonish style of Olimar. Olimar has crashed on a strange planet, leading to a daring rescue mission that <em>also</em> crashed. Oops. You're the backup, sent not only to rescue the series' recognizable mascot, but also the crew sent to save him.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">As a practical matter that makes it a less lonely affair than its predecessors, Pikmin 4 is bursting with other humanoid characters who can serve to explain its various systems and lend a hand. Instead of an isolated mission surrounded by silent plant-creatures, you're part of a crew. And given that Pikmin can be fairly dense with systems to manage, that's a welcome change. They are still largely tutorial givers and systems hubs, but they have some character.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pikmin-4-wants-to-make-a-fresh-start/1100-6515473/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pikmin-4-wants-to-make-a-fresh-start/1100-6515473/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-06-26 13:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Sonic's Amy Rose Will Tell Your Fortune For $28", "description": "<p>Is fate in your favor?

Packed in a sturdy, decorative gift box, the collection features 78 cards, a 128-page booklet, and custom Sonic the Hedgehog illustrations.</p><p>If you're looking to dive into the world of fortune-telling, the included guidebook will help you to deliver informed readings as you examine the Major Arcana. Even if you're not planning to see what the future has in store for you, the deck looks great and makes for some fine art that you can display in your home. It's also officially endorsed by Sega, making this the only licensed recreation of Amy Rose's fortune card deck.</p><p> </p></div>                <div class=\"item-buttons\">                  <div>                      <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BTXBNT2C?tag=gamespot-preorders-20\">See on Amazon</a>                              </div>                                         </div>      </div>   </div> </div><p>In related news, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-superstars-has-some-very-cool-preorder-bonuses/1100-6515438/\">preorders on Sonic Superstars</a> are also available and come with some very cool bonuses and include an acrylic display stand, a reversible cover for your game case, and a Lego Eggman in-game skin.</p><div><div><p class=\"associated-header text-custom-bold\">Best Gaming &amp; Tech Deals This Week</p>  <ul>                              <li class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/pc-game-bundles-available-now-fanatical-humble/2900-4765/\">Every Cheap PC Game Bundle You Can Buy Right Now</a></li>                         <li class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-steelseries-collection/1100-6514448/\">Diablo 4 SteelSeries Collection Is Available At Amazon, But You&#039;ll Want To Hurry</a></li>                         <li class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-zelda-merch-50-cool-items-including-tons-of-tears-of-the-kingdom-stuff/2900-4169/\">Best Zelda Merch: 50 Cool Items, Including Tons Of Tears Of The Kingdom Stuff</a></li>                          <li class=\"pinbox__hide-link js-unhide-list link\">         <span>+ Show More Best Gaming &amp; Tech Deals This Week Links (2)</span>       </li>          <li class=\"hide\"><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-switch-oled-still-available-at-select-retailers/1100-6513686/\">Zelda Tears Of The Kingdom Switch OLED Still Available At Select Retailers</a></li>                         <li class=\"hide\"><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-themed-apparel-is-available-at-amazon/2900-4740/\">Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom-Themed Apparel Is Available At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div></div><p> </p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonics-amy-rose-will-tell-your-fortune-for-28/1100-6515475/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonics-amy-rose-will-tell-your-fortune-for-28/1100-6515475/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-06-26 10:45:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Amazon Has Some Stellar iPad And Apple Pencil Deals", "description": "<p>Apple's range of hardware usually commands a premium price for some of the best consumer technology around, but right now, you can save big on several pieces of excellent gear from the company.
