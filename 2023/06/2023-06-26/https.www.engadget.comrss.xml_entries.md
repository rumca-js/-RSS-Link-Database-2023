<p>Congress apparently has strict limits on the use of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chatgpt-is-suddenly-everywhere-are-we-ready-180031821.html">ChatGPT</a> and similar generative AI tools. <em>Axios</em><a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/06/26/congress-rules-staff-chatgpt">claims</a> to have obtained a memo from House of Representatives administrative chief Catherine Szpindor setting narrow conditions for the use of ChatGPT and similar large language AI models in congressional offices. Staff are only allowed to use the paid <a href="https://www.engadget.com/openai-chatgpt-plus-subscription-205027758.html">ChatGPT Plus</a> service due to its tighter privacy controls, and then only for &quot;research and evaluation,&quot; Szpindor says. They can't use the technology as part of their everyday work.</p><p>House offices are only allowed to use the chatbot with publicly accessible data even when using Plus, Szpindor adds. The privacy features have to be manually enabled to prevent interactions from feeding data into the AI model. ChatGPT's free tier isn't currently allowed, as are any other large language models.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We've asked the House for comment and will let you know if we hear back. A use policy like this wouldn't be surprising, though. Institutions and companies have warned against using generative AI due to the potential for accidents and misuse. Republicans drew criticism for using an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/republicans-attack-biden-with-a-fully-ai-generated-ad-184055192.html">AI-generated attack ad</a>, for instance, while Samsung staff supposedly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/three-samsung-employees-reportedly-leaked-sensitive-data-to-chatgpt-190221114.html">leaked sensitive data</a> through ChatGPT while using the bot for work. Schools have banned these systems over <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chatgpt-openai-new-york-city-public-schools-ban-192608080.html">cheating concerns</a>. House restrictions theoretically prevent similar problems, such as AI-written legislation and speeches.</p><p>The House policy might not face much opposition. Both sides of Congress are attempting to regulate and otherwise govern AI. In the House, Representative Ritchie Torries <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/06/03/house-democrats-ritchie-torres-ai-disclosure">introduced</a> a bill that would require disclaimers for uses of generative AI, while Representative Yvette Clark wants similar <a href="https://www.engadget.com/house-bill-would-demand-disclosure-of-ai-generated-content-in-political-ads-190524733.html">disclosures for political ads</a>. Senators have conducted hearings on AI and put forward a bill to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/senate-bill-would-hold-ai-companies-liable-for-harmful-content-212340911.html">hold AI developers accountable</a> for harmful content produced using their platforms.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/congress-is-reportedly-limiting-staff-use-of-ai-models-like-chatgpt-195454777.html?src=rss

<p>If you’re a fan of psychological horror, you should mark August 22nd on your calendar. That’s when an intriguing new game called <em>Fort Solis </em>arrives<em>. </em>Developer Fallen Leaf describes its debut as a psychological sci-fi thriller. The game casts players as Jack Leary, an engineer sent to investigate a remote mining base on Mars. Roger Clark, best known for his role as Arthur Morgan in <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, voices Leary, with Tory Baker (<em>The Last of Us</em>, <em>Death Stranding</em>) and Julia Brown (<em>The Last Kingdom</em>, <em>World on Fire</em>) rounding out the cast.</p><p>Watching the trailer for <em>Fort Solis</em>, you might get the sense Fallen Leaf was inspired by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dead-space-remake-playstation-5-review-160019905.html"><em><ins>Dead Space</ins></em></a>, but the studio says it was most directly influenced by narrative titles like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-03-firewatch-team-pauses-its-next-game-to-work-on-valve-titles.html"><em><ins>Firewatch</ins></em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-quarry-game-release-date-201557551.html"><em><ins>Until Dawn</ins></em></a>. Fallen Leaf notes there are no camera cuts or loading screens to break up the game’s story, which “can be binged in one intense session.” If nothing else, <em>Fort Solis</em> should be a technical showcase. Alongside <a href="https://www.engadget.com/layers-of-fear-gameplay-footage-takes-you-on-a-tour-of-a-gorgeous-creepy-lighthouse-172058956.html"><em><ins>Layers of Fear</ins></em></a>, it’s one of the first Unreal Engine 5 games to arrive since Epic first teased the tech <a href="https://www.engadget.com/epic-games-unreal-engine-5-demo-150044561.html"><ins>back in 2020</ins></a>.<em> Fort Solis </em>will be available on PlayStation 5, PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store) and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-silicon-macs-now-natively-support-unreal-engine-5-124257710.html"><ins>Mac</ins></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="67c98547e8f9456da54058c82fb5ff81"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/sci-fi-thriller-fort-solis-arrives-on-playstation-5-pc-and-mac-on-august-22nd-191021189.html?src=rss

## Lithium-ion battery creator John Goodenough dies at 100

<p>One of the most influential scientists in technology has passed away. The University of Texas at Austin has <a href="https://news.utexas.edu/2023/06/26/ut-mourns-lithium-ion-battery-inventor-and-nobel-prize-recipient-john-goodenough/">confirmed</a> that Dr. John Goodenough, widely credited as the creator of the lithium-ion battery, has died at the age of 100. While you might not have heard of him, he's effectively responsible for making cellphones, laptops and electric vehicles practical.</p><p>Researchers had been exploring lithium batteries before. Dr. M. Stanley Whittingham, for instance, produced a design combining lithium with titanium disulfide. However, <em>The New York Times</em><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjODEzYWUzOS03ZDU4LTQxY2ItYWM2Ni1hZDgzMDYwNmNlZWYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNi8yNi9zY2llbmNlL2pvaG4tZ29vZGVub3VnaC1kZWFkLmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImU0ZmQ1N2QwLWQwYWMtNGZmMi05ZWRlLTEwZTMzMmRiMTVkMSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAeUqLoD0SfKklNM74Dnqqy8xCGs9EyeVZiSAKZkZHssV&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2023%2F06%2F26%2Fscience%2Fjohn-goodenough-dead.html">notes</a> it was Goodenough who achieved a major breakthrough in 1980 while at the University of Oxford. He made a cathode with layers of lithium and cobalt oxide that produced a stronger voltage while greatly improving safety. It had much more capacity than previous batteries, such as lead acid (used in cars) and nickel-cadmium (found in many portable electronics).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The technology didn't flourish until Dr. Akira Yoshino scrapped raw lithium in favor of safer lithium ions. The scientist produced a practical design for Asahi Kasei Corporation, and Sony delivered the first consumer-friendly rechargeable lithium-ion battery in 1991. You know what happened next — the improved performance enabled mobile devices that were either more portable or simply hadn't been an option before. Cellphones and laptops could become sleeker, faster and longer-lasting, while electric cars were finally viable.</p><p>Goodenough was responsible for much more, however. During his stint at MIT in the 1950s and 1960s, he helped pioneer the technology that would eventually become the random access memory (RAM) you see in many computing products. He routinely shared patents with colleagues. He was also an active researcher into his 90s, and until a few years ago was developing next-generation battery tech that promised breakthrough performance for renewable energy and EVs.</p><p>While relatively unknown in public circles, Goodenough did receive recognition for his work. He received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2019 and the US National Medal of science in 2011, among other accolades.</p><p>Industries are slowly moving on from lithium-ion batteries. Automakers are planning EVs with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nissan-solid-state-battery-ev-release-date-182025167.html">solid-state batteries</a> that deliver higher densities, faster charging and lower costs. However, it's safe to say the modern tech landscape wouldn't be what it is without Goodenough's efforts, and his legacy will likely be felt for years to come.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/lithium-ion-battery-creator-john-goodenough-dies-at-100-171553322.html?src=rss

## Google Pixel Fold review: The challenger that Samsung needs

<p>For the past few years, Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold line has been the undisputed champion of big flexible phones. But it holds that title  almost by default thanks to a lack of real contenders — especially outside of China. But with the Pixel Fold, Google has created <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=89f68c82-f255-44fa-8db9-03fec996b93a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YouTube&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4OWY2OGM4Mi1mMjU1LTQ0ZmEtOGRiOS0wM2ZlYzk5NmI5M2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1nbFRLa2RzMTBNYyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiN2QyMzI3YzEtNzM5MC00N2M4LTlhZDMtNTAyOWE2MjNhYjc0In0&amp;signature=AQAAAdphrZUJA5lfQEVKNn_GHydYNfSSTSzm5TZvcoyobhUn&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DglTKkds10Mc">a legitimate challenger</a> with an innovative design that directly addresses some of the weaknesses of Samsung's heavyweight foldable. So even though its $1,799 price will prevent most people from throwing down on a front-row seat, Google's first flagship foldable phone is definitely a worthy rival.</p><h2>Design and displays</h2><p>Enough with all the boxing metaphors, let's look at what we're actually dealing with here. The Google Pixel Fold features a 5.8-inch exterior screen that opens up to reveal a flexible 7.6-inch interior display, both of which are 120hz OLEDs. On paper, that sounds very similar to what Samsung offers on the<a href="https://www.engadget.com/z-fold-3-long-term-durability-report-heres-what-samsung-still-cant-get-right-130053466.html"> Z Fold 4</a>, but Google has played around with the phone's build and dimensions to create what might be the best showcase of the company's design chops to date.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="58ff9d82291844b4af78b61a0ec165d0"></div><p></p><p>Instead of something like Samsung's skinnier baton-like form, Google chose a wider 17.4:9 aspect ratio for the Pixel Fold's 2,092 x 1,080 exterior display, resulting in a device shaped more like a passport. The benefit is you don’t need to switch to the bigger interior screen as often. And while this might seem like a minor tweak, it makes a huge difference.</p><p>The Z Fold 4’s cover display is so skinny that typing feels cramped. It’s really only usable for basic things like looking up directions or checking notifications. But on the Pixel Fold, everything just kind of works. The screen is small enough that even someone with medium-sized hands like me doesn't have trouble reaching the corners of the screen, yet big enough that apps look and behave normally. And<em>&nbsp;</em>because you don't need to open the device as often, the battery can actually last a little longer.</p><figure><img alt="While the Pixel Fold does have a crease where the phone bends in half, Google has done a good job of minimizing its appearance. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/6aac4530-142e-11ee-bfba-a8774cc8bc56" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Perhaps more importantly, Google has done some nifty things with the Pixel Fold's hinge and chassis so there's essentially no gap between the phone’s halves while still being extremely thin. It measures less than 6mm thick and around 12.1mm when closed, so despite being a touch heavier than the Z Fold 4, it feels more balanced. Unless your jeans are painted on, you shouldn't have much trouble fitting the Pixel Fold in a pocket. And unlike so many other flexible phones, the Pixel Fold has an IPX8 rating for water resistance, so you don't need to fear an accidental splash or submersion.</p><p>One side effect of having a wider screen on the outside is that when you open the Pixel Fold, you get a landscape orientation that’s great for watching videos. After starting a clip on the outside screen, you can just unfold the phone, expand it and voila, no need to rotate. Instead of going for a completely bezel-less design like most traditional phones, Google gave the Pixel Fold slightly larger love handles. This means there's no need for a low-res under-display selfie camera like on the Z Fold 4. There’s actually room for an 8-megapixel camera in the top right corner. And that extra space around the hinge lets you hold the Pixel Fold like a paperback book, which is very satisfying when you're using it as an e-reader.</p><figure><img alt="Alongside a traditional volume rocker, the Pixel Fold features a fingerprint sensor built into its power/lock button. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/6ab768c1-142e-11ee-99b1-2a112ce4ea60" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>It's about time I addressed the elephant in the room: Yes, there's a crease. You can feel it with your fingers and, depending on the angle, you can see it too. But Google has managed to minimize how distracting it is. That said, I've been using a foldable phone as my daily driver for the last three years, so I may be more used to it than most.</p><h2>Durability</h2><p>While foldables have been around for a few years, now that Google is getting into the game, there are some things that potential first-time flexible phone buyers should be aware of. When you first open the Pixel Fold’s box, there’s a warning that calls attention to the phone's display. Google notes that “flexible screens are softer than traditional phone screens, so avoid contact with sand, crumbs, fingernails or sharp objects.” Additionally, Google says that the owners should not “remove the pre-installed screen protector,” and that users should “avoid installing third-party screen protectors.” In short: you have to be a little more gentle with foldable phones than your standard glass-and-metal handset.</p><figure><img alt="Google says the Pixel Fold's hinge was integral in making the phone both super slim and have the ability to fold completely flat. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/6ab78fd0-142e-11ee-983e-c84f7ca64d50" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>So far, I haven’t had any issues with the Pixel Fold’s display or its pre-install screen protector. That said, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/z-fold-3-long-term-durability-report-heres-what-samsung-still-cant-get-right-130053466.html">I’ve owned three Galaxy Z Fold phones</a> with similar screen protectors that bubbled up six to eight months after purchase, so it’s possible the Pixel Fold may exhibit similar issues over time. When questioned further about durability and customer support, a Google spokesperson told Engadget “We have rigorously tested the screen protector to stand up to normal wear and tear. If you do encounter an issue, it can be repaired at <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/10227672?hl=en">our service centers</a> for a fee ($29 for preferred care customers or $129 for customers out of warranty).”</p><h2>Software and apps</h2><p>We can't talk about the phone’s interior display without mentioning some of the tweaks Google has made to the apps and UI. Similar to the Z Fold 4, Google created a taskbar for the Pixel Fold, except that this one is a bit more transient. On the home screen, you get your standard row of icons along the bottom. But when you're in an app, you can swipe up to see the taskbar, and from there you can drag an icon to open it in multi-window mode.</p><figure><img alt="When you're in an app, you can swipe up from the bottom of the screen to summon the Pixel Fold's taskbar, and from there it's super easy to choose a second app to display for multitasking. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/6aad0880-142e-11ee-a3f7-cd1ededd8d95" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>The gesture for summoning the taskbar is like a shorter version of swiping up and holding to see recently used apps. Once you select the apps you want, resizing windows is as easy as dragging the divider left or right. If you’d like your apps to switch sides you can double-tap the middle of the split-screen divider. The idea is for the taskbar to appear when you need it and get out of your way when you don't. When combined with the App Suggestion feature in Android (which are the apps that have a ring around the icon), it makes for a simple but effective way of multitasking.</p><p>You can also use the Pixel Fold's dual displays to do stuff like take selfies using the phone's high-res rear cameras or show your subjects a live preview of what they look like when you’re taking their photo. But we've seen that before on devices like the Z Fold and the new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/moto-razr-review-finally-some-real-competition-for-samsungs-flip-foldables-203033514.html">Razr+</a>. Unfortunately, one of the Pixel Fold's coolest new features — Dual-Screen Interpreter mode — isn't available yet, as it's based on features in Android 14, which won’t be out until sometime in the fall.</p><figure><img alt="One example of an app that has been optimized for foldable devices is YouTube, which features a special Tabletop UI when the Pixel Fold is bent in half. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/6ab768c0-142e-11ee-bdef-808f6727bcf5" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Google says that over 50 first-party apps have already been optimized for use on devices like the Pixel Fold. Some of the enhancements <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-12-l-hands-on-some-big-multitasking-upgrades-but-is-it-enough-180002295.html">we've gotten a taste of before</a>, like tabletop mode in YouTube. But there are a number of refined examples, including those from third parties like WhatsApp where you can share images from Google Photos just by dragging and dropping. With this much real estate to work with, you really do feel empowered when switching from the outside to the interior display. And after playing games like <em>Asphalt 9</em> that support adaptive resolutions, I'm really hoping more developers get on board.</p><h2>Cameras</h2><p>One of my biggest gripes with the Z Fold 4 is that Samsung wasn't able to deliver the same level of image quality that you get on the Galaxy S Ultra. But the Pixel Fold doesn’t feel as compromised. It features a 48MP main sensor, a 10.8MP ultrawide and a 10.8MP telephoto with a 5x optical zoom. Combine that with Google's excellent photo processing and the result is cameras that are just flat-out better.</p><figure><img alt="Thanks to a longer 5x optical and excellent image processing, the Pixel Fold offers an upgraded photography experience when compared to Samsung's Z Fold 4. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/6aad7db1-142e-11ee-bf5f-a7c7880de96c" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>In daylight, the Pixel Fold's pics were consistently a touch sharper than Samsung’s while often delivering more detail with better shadows and highlights. Even with Samsung's food mode activated, the Pixel Fold made my taco dinner look more appetizing too. Google's Night Sight continues to reign supreme when it comes to capturing clearer and more well-exposed photos in the dark.</p><h2>Performance and battery life</h2><p>Powering the Pixel Fold is Google's Tensor G2 along with 12GB of RAM and up to 512GB of storage. It's not an overflowing well of speed, and as people have experienced on other Pixel devices, the Fold sometimes runs a little warm. But even when I was multitasking or trying to push it, the phone never felt lethargic, which is all I can really ask for.</p><figure><img alt="By moving the Pixel Fold's hinges to the very top and bottom of the device, Google was able to create a foldable phone that doesn't have a gap between its sides when closed. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/6aac6c40-142e-11ee-a5ec-b03bc9a3092a" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Meanwhile, even though Google’s 4,820mAh battery is a tiny bit smaller than on the Z Fold 4, there wasn’t a big difference in overall longevity, which is to say it's pretty good. I ran our video rundown test on both their external and internal displays. On the former, the Pixel Fold outlasted Samsung's big foldable, posting a time of 22 hours and 21 minutes versus the latter's 20:45. Using their larger screens, though, the Z Fold 4 came out ahead with a time of 17:13 compared to the Pixel’s 15:42.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>For Google's entry into the world of fancy flexible phones, the Pixel Fold feels like a win. Its clever hinge and slim chassis make it easy to use and carry, while its wider body delivers on Google's promise of making the phone's exterior screen a lot more usable. Featuring strong water resistance, better cameras and UI tweaks to make multitasking a tiny bit simpler, the Pixel Fold more than holds its own against Samsung's Z Fold 4. And that's before considering all the great Pixel-specific features like Call Screener, Recorder and more.</p><figure><img alt="On the inside, the Pixel Fold features a 7.6-inch flexible display with a landscape orientation instead of the more portrait-like aspect ratio you get on Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold line. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/6aad7db0-142e-11ee-8f3b-c64837e67429" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>My main gripes (you know, aside from its price) are that it occasionally feels like the phone is never fully open. Sometimes I feel like I have to put more pressure on it than I'd like to make it completely flat. And while it would be nice if the Pixel Fold came with stylus support like the Z Fold 4, I’m happy to wait till Samsung, Google or whoever finds room to store a pen inside the device.</p><p>Admittedly, some folks may say that the Pixel Fold isn’t really advancing the overall capabilities of flexible phones, as many of its features like dual-window multitasking are already available on devices like the Z Fold 4. The issue is that until we get a critical mass of big foldables, developers aren’t going to consider tweaking or optimizing their apps. That’s why this phone had to come first. With the Pixel Fold, Google brought its style and rhythm to a title fight and didn't come up short. But, perhaps most importantly, Google now has a device it can use to shape the future of Android beyond typical glass bricks.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-fold-review-the-challenger-that-samsung-needs-specs-price-170003458.html?src=rss

## Urtopia's Chord e-bike is a little overkill for a city ride and that's okay

<p>Urtopia may be a relatively new name in the e-bike world, but it makes a strong first impression. With its 4G, GPS, mmWave sensors and even light projection turn indicators, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/urtopias-tech-heavy-ebike-shows-that-good-software-is-key-120017530.html">Carbon 1</a> felt like the Inspector Gadget of two-wheeled travel, but its exotic design and road-bike leanings meant it wasn’t for everyone. The company’s second bike, the Chord ($1,799), has a much less divisive aesthetic and – unlike its sibling – practicalities like gears and a more upright (and city-friendly) ride. Importantly, the Chord contains all the wireless connectivity of the Carbon 1 at a cheaper price, possibly making it a more compelling package overall.</p><p>The Chord feels like Urtopia’s attempt at a stylish city bike in the vague style of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cowboy-4-ebike-adaptive-power-update-test-ride-134503675.html">Cowboy</a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vanmoof-ebike-s5-a5-test-ride-pricing-150525845.html">VanMoof</a>. The Chord is apparently inspired by pianos, with its black and white colorway and the melodic notes that play when you cycle through the power modes. At 46 pounds (21 kilograms), it’s noticeably heavier than the Carbon 1 (33 pounds/15 kg), but it’s on par with other models in the same category.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The motor is a pretty straightforward 350W hub powered by a removable 360Wh battery. Top assisted speed is 20MPH over four modes: Eco, Comfort, Sport and Turbo. The maximum range is an estimated 75 miles, but that will obviously depend on how much assistance you use. As a Class 1 ebike, there’s no throttle mode here; instead, there’s a Turbo mode with barely any need to pedal to get you up to that maximum speed. As mentioned, the Chord comes with an 8-speed Shimano gear system which, combined with the assistance modes, make for a flexible ride in terms of speed and effort.</p><figure><img alt="Urtopia's Chord e-bike pictured on a sunny promenade." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/7e555340-09d1-11ee-bfff-b7f3441dba54" style="height: 1237px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>The more interesting features with Urtopia bikes come from its connectivity: WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS and 4G. Combined with an accelerometer and a gyroscope the Chord has a surprising amount of situational awareness, which I’ll get to later. Oh, you can also speak to the bike to change settings and use it as a Bluetooth speaker as you ride while receiving visual directions on the dot-matrix screen contained in the “smart box” bike computer. Did I mention there’s a comprehensive app with ride tracking, navigation and deeper settings, too?</p><p>Taking the Chord out for the first time, it was hard to ignore the extra weight compared to the aforementioned Carbon 1, but also the similarly pitched <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tenways-cgo600-preview-143051234.html">Tenways</a>. It’s not chonky in the same way something like the 63-pound (28-kilogram) <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy52ZWxvdHJpY2Jpa2UuY29tL3Byb2R1Y3RzL3ZlbG90cmljLWRpc2NvdmVyLTE_dmFyaWFudD00MTA0NTY0ODMxMDQ1NSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNzY5OTJkYzgtN2FlZi00NmI1LTlmNDgtOGNjMDE3OWRkNjExIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAetOjBA8VaJZjkKSW_ScIrCk5GpdQp3tiPRuEEGJ3QqN&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.velotricbike.com%2Fproducts%2Fvelotric-discover-1%3Fvariant%3D41045648310455">Velotric Discover 1</a> is but those extra pounds were noticeable the first time I tried hustling it (upright) into the elevator in my apartment block. Thankfully, it’s not something you’ll notice so much while pedaling.</p><p>The riding position is naturally more upright and it makes for a comfortable cruise around town. It’s not designed for off-road, but if you find yourself on uneven pavement or even a short stint on a dirt trail it does a decent job considering. The motor uses a torque sensor to decide when to kick in; it’s a very common system right now and does a good job of delivering power just as you need it.</p><p>Now, about that power. In the scheme of things, a 350W motor is a pretty standard entry-level option; it’s not about to pull your wrists out of their sockets when it kicks in, but it’s gets you to that 20MPH  max speed in good time, as long as you’re willing to do the your part on the pedals. The three power modes are spaced adequately for whether you just want a little help or just wanna surprise that weekend warrior as you pass them barely pedaling. Turbo mode will reach max power without you really trying too hard – it’s a good option for if you’re feeling really pooped, and it doesn’t feel like the bike is pulling away from you, which can sometimes be the case with similar modes on higher-powered bikes.</p><figure><img alt="Urtopia e-bike's ride computer." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/75478e70-09d2-11ee-bf9a-aa796e11a7ee" style="height: 1333px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Utopia’s heavy-tech approach made the Carbon 1 stand out, but it also felt a little unpolished, at least in the first iteration of the app. The built-in GPS and 4G are meant to automatically record your rides and serve them up in the app with a map and statistics. Initially this felt a bit hit-and-miss. The fingerprint reader in the Carbon 1 was a nice touch, too, and it even doubled as an electric bell, but unfortunately it would often sound about half a second after I needed it. With the newer Chord, the software feels more finished from the get-go.</p><p>For starters, the bell is still digital (you can even change the sound), but it’s triggered by a much clickier button that’s much more responsive. More importantly, the app feels more refined now and I haven’t seen any rides go missing during my time with it. In fact, they appear almost instantly once I finish.</p><p>Of course, automatically mapping rides is cool, but it’s not the primary purpose of the 4G/GPS. <em>That </em>would be the ability to track your bike if someone steals it. As long as the Chord’s within cell coverage, you’ll be able to see its last known location via the app. You can also set it so you receive notification the moment the bike moves – potentially giving you a heads up before a thief can ride off with it. Of course, if the battery runs out or the GPS can’t see the sky it won’t update the app, but the cell lasts for a good amount of time in standby and it only fully turns off if you remove the battery, which requires a key (or bike-breaking brute force).</p><p>A quick note on the battery: Its placement under the top tube is a cunning way to semi-hide it, but also provides a little more protection from the elements. On the flip side, there’s no way to fully turn the bike off, so the 4G connection will gently drain the power between rides unless you remove it. In my testing, I also found that the estimated max range of 75 miles feels a little optimistic. It might be possible under optimal conditions, but even on shorter rides of 11 miles, with mixed use of modes and terrain, I had used up a claimed 25 percent of the cell. So if very long rides are your thing, take note.</p><p>If, upon hearing about all this 4G data you’ll be using, your first question was how much that’ll cost, the answer is nothing for the first year and then $29 annually after that. While it feels like everything has a subscription attached to it these days, this feels reasonable for the functionality you get out of it – especially if your bike <em>does</em> go missing and this helps you find it.</p><p>Beyond knowing where the bike is, the Chord can also guide you to your destination via built-in navigation. To be clear, it’s handled by the app, but when your phone is connected to the bike, the directions will appear on the dot-matrix style display. This also means you can keep your handset safely in your pocket or bag – unlike some bikes that make your phone the bike’s computer, forcing it to remain exposed to the elements.</p><figure><img alt="Urtopia's Chord e-bike pictured in front of Valencia's Arts and Sciences." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/b0636470-09d2-11ee-bbdb-2e1a020b1988" style="height: 1333px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>With the Carbon 1, I thought the option to play music through the built-in speaker was a novelty at best. The Chord hasn’t changed my mind either. Your music is going to sound pretty bad, but it’s a fun party trick nonetheless. Perhaps it’s more useful for podcasts and audiobooks? Just know that it’s something you <em>can</em> do (but not necessarily something you should). The voice control is a little more practical, but I rarely find a moment where I’d rather lean into the bike and talk to it instead of using the app’s controls.</p><p>Another interesting change from the Carbon 1 is that the smart box (formerly, smartbar) is no longer built into the bike. On the Chord it’s a separate unit that you attach manually, opening the door for some level of modularity. Urtopia hints at this in its press materials, suggesting that in the future you could upgrade to a different smart box with a better display, or new features which is an interesting concept if nothing else.</p><p>With just its second bike, Urtopia is showing a promising mix of consistency and growth (where needed). The Chord is a pretty enough bike that, if it’s to your taste, would serve as a good general purpose city e-bike. It’s not the most powerful, nor the most longevous in terms of range at this price point. But it’s possibly one of the most tech-laden and featureful if that’s what you’re looking for. Sometime's it feels like there's a little too much focus on the tech features and less on the ride itself. The fact that the door for feature upgrades further down the line, via the modular smart box, though, shows some welcome initiative on the company’s part. For the price, though, it's an easy recommendation if you love a quantified ride and rarely go off-road.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/urtopia-chord-e-bike-151547121.html?src=rss

<p>President Joe Biden will today announce the details of how $42 billion in funding to bolster broadband internet access will be allocated. The investment, which was funded by the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, aims to give all Americans access to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-administration-announces-930-million-in-grants-to-expand-rural-internet-access-153708056.html"><ins>high-speed internet</ins></a> by 2030.</p><p>Last year, the White House <a href="https://www.engadget.com/internet-for-all-program-launch-us-broadband-digital-divide-174215299.html"><ins>announced an initiative</ins></a> that would allocate at least $100 million to participating states through the <a href="https://www.internetforall.gov/program/broadband-equity-access-and-deployment-bead-program"><ins>Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment (BEAD) Program</ins></a>. The remainder of the funding was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bipartisan-infrastructure-law-broadband-funding-delayed-180710457.html"><ins>on hold</ins></a> until the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) drew up a more detailed coverage map showing which homes and businesses <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fcc-rural-broadband-speeds-digital-divide-alternative-connect-america-cost-model-202622178.html"><ins>lacked high-speed internet access</ins></a>. The funding will be allocated based on the map.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/fcc/"><ins>FCC</ins></a> released <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fcc-new-broadband-maps-141810403.html"><ins>its first draft</ins></a> of the overhauled map, which incorporates more granular data, in November. Still, politicians on both sides of the aisle were concerned it left out millions of businesses and homes and urged the White House to delay the broadband funding efforts until issues were resolved.</p><p>After taking feedback from the public and states, the FCC <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/national-broadband-map-it-keeps-getting-better"><ins>unveiled an updated version in May</ins></a>. According to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/06/26/high-speed-internet-white-house-announcement/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=wp_main&amp;utm_source=twitter"><em><ins>The Washington Post,</ins></em></a> the updated map addressed around 4 million mistakes, resulting in approximately half a million more homes, businesses and other locations without any internet access being identified. In all, the FCC determined that more than 8.3 million homes and businesses lack access to high-speed internet.</p><p>States will first focus on bringing broadband to locations that have no access at all. If they have any funding left over, they can use it to improve internet access for those with slow speeds.</p><p>It could take up to two years for the government to dole out all the funding. States will submit their initial plans later this year and that will open up a fifth of the funding, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-detail-plans-42-billion-investment-us-internet-access-2023-06-26/"><em><ins>Reuters</ins></em></a>. The rest of the $42 billion will be unlocked after states finalize plans for investing the funds.</p><p>Many of the locations that lack broadband access are in rural areas. By and large, major providers have shied away from rolling out broadband in these locales due to their smaller populations and the high cost of installing infrastructure.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-biden-administrations-42-billion-broadband-program-is-finally-getting-underway-143625721.html?src=rss

## Amazon will use small businesses to help deliver packages in the US

<p>A local shop might deliver your next Amazon order. The company <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/06/26/amazon-hub-delivery-local-small-biz">tells</a><em>Axios</em> it's launching an Amazon Hub Delivery system that uses small businesses in 23 states (including California, New York and Washington) to complete shipments to customers. Those businesses need secure storage areas and must deliver an average of 30 packages every day outside of major holidays. However, Amazon isn't fussy about business types for this program — bodegas, coffee shops, florists and other locations can all qualify.</p><p>Hub Delivery is ultimately an expansion of previous initiatives. Amazon debuted an &quot;I Have Space&quot; system in India in 2015, and expanded it to both Japan and Spain. An American pilot program began in late 2020, although it focused on improving delivery for rural customers. The new approach covers over 20 major cities, including Boston, New York City and Los Angeles.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The incentives are clear. Amazon gets more reliable deliveries by offloading &quot;last mile&quot; shipments to small businesses rather than relying solely on dedicated couriers. Partners in turn can grow their businesses and supplement their income, Amazon VP Beryl Tomay says. <em>Axios</em> estimates that, at $27,000 in earnings per year, Amazon is paying about $2.50 per package. The online retailer hopes to team with 2,500 small business drivers by the end of 2023.</p><p>The strategy comes months after Amazon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-expanded-job-cuts-18000-102059372.html">announced mass layoffs</a> as the pandemic recovery and a rocky economy ate into profits. It also comes amid <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-again-accused-of-breaking-labor-laws-at-unionized-warehouse-165523220.html">labor complaints</a> that include past allegations of misusing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-dc-lawsuit-delivery-driver-tips-183556389.html">Flex drivers' tips</a>. Hub Delivery theoretically helps Amazon not only trim costs, but minimize the labor disputes that might come with using its own workers for shipping. Not that the tech giant is completely averse to using its own staff. It's still committed to buying about 100,000 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-rivian-electric-delivery-vans-san-francisco-141525649.html">Rivian delivery vans</a> that will bring packages to customers.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/amazon-will-use-small-businesses-to-help-deliver-packages-in-the-us-132503498.html?src=rss

<p>Starting July 1st, any planes without retrofitted sensitive radar altimeters across the US can't land in low visibility, a stipulation that could cause delays for travelers, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2f007401-3eaa-4237-b69b-54ccbe125502&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Wall+Street+Journal&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyZjAwNzQwMS0zZWFhLTQyMzctYjY5Yi01NGNjYmUxMjU1MDIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9wZXRlLWJ1dHRpZ2llZy13YXJucy1vZi1mbGlnaHQtZGVsYXlzLWFzLTVnLWRlYWRsaW5lLWxvb21zLWJjNGFiMjM2IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3NTlkMzU1ZS03M2RmLTQ5OGUtODQ5OC1jMzFlNmY3NTUzOGEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAc-iwFPVUmeI7gzyq9kNnO7i-EdKqeKfvD_Ycp9gie3K&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Fpete-buttigieg-warns-of-flight-delays-as-5g-deadline-looms-bc4ab236"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em> reports</a>. To be clear, this is not addressing an ongoing safety issue — the deadline aligns with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/faa-c-band-5g-verizon-att-airports-altimeters-183206836.html">US wireless companies increasing the power of their 5G networks</a>, potentially creating greater interference for any aircraft without the necessary equipment.</p><p>The 5G boost comes after years of delays and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/5-g-rollout-faa-airlines-carriers-c-band-143026349.html">debates between the Febderal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Federal Aviation Administration</a> (FAA) due to concerns about the signals' impact on radio waves that judge how far a plane is from the ground. Carriers first planned to increase the power of their networks in January 2022, delayed it until July 2022 and finally found a compromise with the FAA to proceed on July 1st, 2023.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>About 80 percent of domestic aircraft have undergone the upgrade, with some top carriers still needing to finish their fleet. Delta, for instance, will have 190 planes left to bring up to par, while JetBlue will have 17 — something the Airlines for America trade association blames on supply chain problems. United, Southwest and American Airlines have all reported they will have no outstanding planes by the deadline. Another 65 percent of aircraft flying from international destinations into the US have up-to-date altimeters, with airlines poised to use those options whenever possible.</p><p>"There's a real risk of delays or cancellations," Buttigieg said. "This represents one of the biggest—probably the biggest—foreseeable problem affecting performance this summer." The level of impact will depend mainly on the weather, but fortunately, there won't be snowstorms anytime soon. All planes in the US will need an updated altimeter by February 2024, regardless of visibility conditions.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/a-5g-deadline-could-ground-some-us-flights-starting-july-1st-122529318.html?src=rss

## The Morning After: NASA is recycling 98 percent of astronaut pee on the ISS into drinkable water

<p>NASA has achieved a technological milestone, announcing the International Space Station’s Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) is now recycling 98 percent of all water astronauts bring onboard. Advanced dehumidifiers capture moisture from the station’s crew breaths and sweats, while urine processor assembly recovers water from astronauts’ urine through vacuum distillation.</p><p>According to NASA, the distillation process produces water and a urine brine that still contains reclaimable H20. Now, a new device can extract the remaining water in the brine, increasing the water recovery rate from 93 to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-is-recycling-98-percent-of-astronaut-pee-and-sweat-on-the-iss-into-drinkable-water-184332789.html">98 percent</a>. If the idea is making you gag, it shouldn’t, says Jill Williamson, NASA’s ECLSS water subsystems manager. “The crew is not drinking urine; they are drinking water that has been reclaimed, filtered and cleaned such that it is cleaner than what we drink here on Earth.” I'll pass.</p><p>– Mat Smith</p><p><em>The Morning After isn’t just a</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/"><em> newsletter</em></a><em> –  it’s also a daily podcast.

## Lucid will power Aston Martin's future EVs

<p>Aston Martin plans to build &quot;ultra-luxury high-performance&quot; EVs using Lucid's electric motors, batteries and other technology, Lucid announced in a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lucids-world-leading-electric-powertrain-technology-propels-aston-martin-to-a-bold-electric-future-301862865.html">press release</a>. It's the first deal for Lucid to supply parts to other automakers — much like Rimac, which itself <a href="https://www.engadget.com/porsche-pours-more-cash-into-ev-supercar-company-rimac-084954421.html">developed</a> batteries and other components for Aston Martin, along with Koenigsegg and others. Lucid recently released its own debut electric car, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lucid-air-dream-edition-performance-ev-video-120005153.html">the Air</a>, in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lucid-air-ev-pure-touring-trim-video-140048588.html">multiple versions</a> starting at around $87,400.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;The supply agreement with Lucid is a game changer for the future EV-led growth of Aston Martin,&quot; said Aston Martin executive chairman Lawrence Stroll. &quot;Based on our strategy and requirements, we selected Lucid, gaining access to the industry's highest performance and most innovative technologies for our future BEV products.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Aston Martin said it selected Lucid through a &quot;competitive process&quot; and will use Lucid's proprietary electric powertrain technology, including its ultra-high performance twin motor drive unit, battery technology, and onboard &quot;Wunderbox&quot; charging unit. The technology will allow for features like torque vectoring, heat exchanger tech and a battery system upgraded for higher power.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2020, Aston Martin <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-10-aston-martin-rapide-e-canceled.html">scrapped plans</a> to manufacture an all-electric Rapide E, saying it wouldn't release any EVs until it's &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-31-aston-martin-delays-evs-emergency-investment.html">financially stable</a>.&quot; Stroll, a Canadian billionaire who also owns the Aston Martin F1 team, took a 25 percent ownership in Aston Martin back in 2020. Mercedes-Benz, meanwhile, currently owns 9.4 percent of Aston Martin, and previously said it plans to increase that to 20 percent by 2023.&nbsp;</p><p>As part of that deal, Mercedes-Benz granted Aston Martin access to its hybrid and electric powertrains, but it's not clear how Lucid and Mercedes will interact. Aston Martin's F1 team currently uses a Mercedes-Benz power unit, though it plans to switch to Honda in 2026. &quot;Along with Mercedes-Benz, we now have two world-class suppliers [with Lucid] to support the internal development and investments we are making to deliver our electrification strategy,&quot; Stroll said.&nbsp;</p><p>Rimac has <a href="https://www.carthrottle.com/post/the-aston-martin-valkyrie-has-a-1160bhp-total-output-thanks-to-rimac/">supplied technology</a>, including a lightweight battery system, to Aston Martin's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/aston-martin-valkyrie-heads-public-100000985.html">1,160 HP Valkyrie hypercar</a>. Back in 2015, Aston Martin joined forces with LeEco to build an <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/04/15/aston-martin-rapide-e-electric-fd7ks49g/">electric version of the Rapide</a>, but LeEco <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-07-20-leeco-jia-yueting-investigation.html">bowed out</a> with its own financial issues. To complete the circle, LeEco originally had a stake in Lucid, but founder Jia Yueting was <a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/7/20/15999024/lucid-motors-ford-funding-tesla-electric-car">forced to sell</a> it due to a liquidity crisis.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/lucid-will-power-aston-martins-future-evs-101040684.html?src=rss

## Netflix is removing its 'basic' plan in Canada

<p>Users in Canada are once again serving as involuntary first adopters of Netflix's new policies. Following its February decision to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-account-sharing-rollout-countries-202340036.html">charge more for account sharing</a> between houses in the country, the streamer has now announced its basic plan will no longer be an option for Canada's subscribers, <a href="https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/entertainment/movies/2023/06/23/netflix-phases-out-basic-streaming-plan-from-its-subscription-options-in-canada"><em>The Winnipeg Free Press</em> reports</a>.</p><p>Anyone already on a basic plan doesn't have to worry about being kicked off it, but if they choose to move to another option or close their account, they can't get back on that tier. New users can no longer choose the basic option, while current subscribers on other plans will lose the opportunity to switch over &quot;in the near future.&quot; In Canada, the basic tier is $9.99 (CAD) per month, while the basic with ads tier is $5.99, the standard is $16.49 and the premium is $20.99.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>After claiming it would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-ad-supported-plan-password-sharing-charge-2022-160931971.html">never offer an ad-supported option</a>, Netflix did just that in November 2022, launching the new tier in Canada, the US and ten other countries. Now with the decision to remove its basic option, the streamer is pushing more of its customers towards an ad-filled viewing experience. The rationale is simple: Ad-supported plans can be highly beneficial to Netflix's bottom line. In the first quarter of 2023, across the US, <a href="https://ir.netflix.net/investor-news-and-events/financial-releases/press-release-details/2023/Netflix-Releases-First-Quarter-2023-Financial-Results/default.aspx">Netflix saw its basic with ads tier bring in more money</a> per user than its standard plan. This dichotomy held even though its ad tier is $6.99, compared to its standard plan costing $15.49.</p><p>There's no indication that Netflix will remove the basic tier in the US anytime soon, but if you want to avoid paying more or watching ads, now might be the time to pick it. In the US, the basic plan is $9.99, and the premium is $19.99.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/netflix-is-removing-its-basic-plan-in-canada-092535002.html?src=rss

To that end, NASA is developing a system that will allow astronauts to perform maneuvers, conduct experiments and more using a natural-language ChatGPT-like interface, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jun/24/nasa-spaceships-talk-chatgpt-larissa-suzuki"><em>The Guardian</em></a> reported.&nbsp;</p><p>"The idea is to get to a point where we have conversational interactions with space vehicles and they [are] also talking back to us on alerts, interesting findings they see in the solar system and beyond," said Dr. Larissa Suzuki, speaking at an IEEE meeting on next-gen space communication. "It's really not like science fiction anymore."&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>NASA aims to deploy the system on its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-lunar-gateway-launch-contract-231142514.html">Lunar Gateway</a>, a space station that will orbit the Moon and provide support for NASA's <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/humans-on-the-moon/index.html">Artemis mission</a>. It would use a natural language interface that allows astronauts to seek advice on experiments or conduct maneuvers without diving into complex manuals.&nbsp;</p><p>On a <a href="https://sbir.nasa.gov/content/autonomous-systems-and-operations-lunar-orbital-platform-gateway-1">dedicated page</a> soliciting small business support for Lunar Gateway, NASA wrote that it would require AI and machine learning technologies to manage various systems when it's unoccupied as well. Those include autonomous operations of science payloads, data transmission prioritization, autonomous operations, health management of Gateway and more.</p><p>For instance, Suzuki outlined a scenario in which the system would automatically fix data transmission glitches and inefficiencies, along with other types of digital outages. "We cannot send an engineer up in space whenever a space vehicle goes offline or its software breaks somehow," she said.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/nasa-is-creating-a-chatgpt-like-assistant-for-astronauts-081903604.html?src=rss
