It was a time when, although it was never put in such terms by anyone in authority, the rule of thumb seemed to be that if you had an invisible disability \u2013 such as deafness, say \u2013 you were expected to fit in with the \u201cnormal\u201d world (it was also a time when such quote marks were rarely used). If you had a visible disability, you were expected to keep yourself hidden as much as possible so as not to upset anyone. The one thing both approaches had in common is that they very much weren\u2019t about making the people with disabilities comfortable. Comfort, ease, the ability to move through the world without being made conscious of what you could and couldn\u2019t do? These were the prerogative of \u201cnormal\u201d people.</p><p>The main takeaway from Rose Ayling-Ellis: Signs for Change is how little things have changed in the 30 years since \u2013 though the existence of this documentary and the public profile of Ayling-Ellis herself shows we may yet hope for progress.

She has naturally become a role model and figurehead for the deaf community. One mother, Katie, whose two-year-old son Alvie was diagnosed as deaf at seven weeks, speaks very movingly about what Rose meant to her as she wrestled with the sense of powerlessness the news had given her. \u201cI\u2019d been holding him and singing him to sleep every night.

It is just this kind of cultural cringe to the US, and the notions it exports to these shores, that sits at the heart of <em>This </em><em>Is </em><em>Not America</em>, Tomiwa Owolade\u2019s timely intervention into the politics of identity. Owolade contends that Britain continues to cede authority to the US, especially in matters of race, and is blind to what should be obvious: we are not America. <br /><br />Britain\u2019s problems with race pale beside the awful day-to-day enmity in the US. Increasingly, though \u2013 with the murder of George Floyd, the adoption of acronyms such as Bicop (Black, Indigenous and People of Colour), the capitalisation of Black and White, the rise, fall and rise again of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a>, and the mass incarceration of African American men \u2014 insights from across the Atlantic are embraced. This is tied up with the allure of America generally, believes Owolade. Which is undoubtedly true: even today British newspapers are more likely to genuflect in front of an African American than a black Briton.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/26/this-is-not-america-by-tomiwa-owolade-review-why-black-lives-in-britain-matter\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/26/this-is-not-america-by-tomiwa-owolade-review-why-black-lives-in-britain-matter", "date_published": "2023-06-26 06:00:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "\u2018So many reports of violence and abuse\u2019: how the gig economy fails women around the world", "description": "<p>Unsafe conditions, sexual harassment and gender-based discrimination are rife among female workers, research finds  </p><p>\u201cI have to be honest,\u201d says Anjali Krishan. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise how bad things can get for women and gender minorities in the platform industry.
