Such is their state of delusion that these entitled so-and-sos want somebody with iron-clad credentials in charge of their club, a serial winner in the mould of \u2026 er, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho or Antonio Conte. What they emphatically don\u2019t want is some comparatively chilled out larrikin, who may not be as well known but has led four different teams to victory in six different title races, three domestic cups and an international championship since Spurs won their most recent trophy, whatever it was the Milk Cup was called back in 2008.</p><p>I haven\u2019t taken the trouble to write to the Football Daily before, mainly because I hadn\u2019t quite grasped the fact that it is really just a former tea-timely iteration in a posh frock, but recent events make it hard to resist the temptation to rant. I am a Wigan Athletic season-ticket holder and, as such, am in a perpetual state of tension \u2013 just check out our 10-year record of relegation, promotion, near-misses, administration and points deductions since that great FA Cup final to see why (congrats to City, btw). My recent tension levels are at an all-time high, though. The Football League insists on repeatedly docking the club points. This does not stop the club defaulting on wages because, guess what, they haven\u2019t got enough money to pay them. We will now start next season on -8 points (if we start next season at all) and be favourites for relegation to League Two. The concept of a sanction that penalises the wrong people <em>and</em> cannot stop the club defaulting again is plainly ridiculous. On the other hand, the Football League has twice passed owners of Wigan as being fit and proper when \u2026 well. What penalty is it giving itself? Just saying\u201d \u2013 Alan Willis.</p><p>If only Jos\u00e9 Mourinho could land the job at Inter Miami. Now there\u2019s a fly-on-the-wall documentary I\u2019d like to see. Like a weird counterweight to Ted Lasso in which a club is revolutionised by relentless negativity\u201d \u2013 Stephen Butler.</p><p><em><strong>This is an extract from our daily football email \u2026 Football Daily.

Whatever the exact year, it\u2019s an age in which a woman choosing to live alone in a forest attracts first gossip and then suspicion from a conservative rural community, particularly if \u2013 matted fabric notwithstanding \u2013 she is not yet 40 and \u201cremnants of my beauty flash through on occasion\u201d.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/05/at-the-edge-of-the-woods-by-kathryn-bromwich-review-an-accomplished-unsettling-debut\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/05/at-the-edge-of-the-woods-by-kathryn-bromwich-review-an-accomplished-unsettling-debut", "date_published": "2023-06-05 06:00:20+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "We can\u2019t get a mortgage to help us buy a listed property.

However, there are complications: first, it is Grade I-listed; second, it seems the seller, who converted it from one single non-domestic building to three separate properties (there is a flat and a proposed cafe downstairs), failed to get a conversion warranty (he didn\u2019t know this was required).</p><p>The first bank we approached (for an \u00a380,000 mortgage) said the property was not mortgageable because of the lack of the conversion warranty (apparently the fact that the seller bought the property more than 10 years ago and has been converting it without living in it means that the warranty is required). The seller then bought a retrospective warranty, and we approached a mortgage broker. However, the mortgage broker has been unable to find a lender who will consider the property mortgageable: some lenders are happy with a Grade I-listed property, some are happy with a retrospective warranty but none, it seems, are happy with both.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jun/05/we-cant-get-a-mortgage-to-help-us-buy-a-listed-property-should-we-find-another-way\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jun/05/we-cant-get-a-mortgage-to-help-us-buy-a-listed-property-should-we-find-another-way", "date_published": "2023-06-05 06:00:20+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Ben Roberts-Smith and four key witnesses were not honest or reliable, judge says in full verdict", "description": "<p>Justice Anthony Besanko\u2019s 736-page judgment has been released after judge last week dismissed defamation case in favour of Nine newspapers and reporters</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/jun/05/australia-news-live-macquarie-island-marine-park-ben-roberts-smith-judgement-war-crime-afghanistan-defamation-reserve-bank-interest-rates-anthony-albanese-indigenous-voice-referendum\">Follow our Australia news live blog for the latest updates</a></li><li>Get our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/29/email-newsletters-guardian-australia-best-daily-news-emails-newsletter-free-sign-up-inbox-subscribe-headlines?CMP=cvau_sfl\">morning and afternoon news emails</a>, <a href=\"https://app.adjust.com/w4u7jx3\">free app</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/full-story?CMP=cvau_sfl\">daily news podcast</a></li></ul><p>Ben Roberts-Smith and four key witnesses he called were not honest or reliable when it came to their evidence, a federal court justice has found in the full judgment of the war veteran\u2019s defamation case.</p><p>Justice Anthony Besanko\u2019s complete judgment \u2013 736 pages long \u2013 was published on Monday afternoon after he delivered an initial summary decision in court on Thursday.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/05/ben-roberts-smith-and-four-key-witnesses-were-not-honest-or-reliable-judge-says-in-full-verdict\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/05/ben-roberts-smith-and-four-key-witnesses-were-not-honest-or-reliable-judge-says-in-full-verdict", "date_published": "2023-06-05 05:24:08+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "TV tonight: controversial music-biz drama from the makers of Euphoria", "description": "<p>A self-help guru played by the Weeknd attempts to create the \u2018sexiest pop star in America\u2019 in The Idol.

Married people are generally considered normal people. As such, they have possessed inordinate power to dictate the terms of normality in a way that single people rarely can. And yet marriage, clearly, isn\u2019t for everyone. Plenty of people have no desire to do it. Plenty of others have done it and haven\u2019t liked it. The stats only corroborate this. Fewer people over the years have been getting married, while the stresses and strains of lockdown in 2020 (along with the temporary closure of venues) saw divorces in England and Wales <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/marriagecohabitationandcivilpartnerships/bulletins/marriagesinenglandandwalesprovisional/2020\">overtake weddings</a> for the first time.</p><p>Not everyone, however, is taking marriage\u2019s declining popularity lying down.

Likewise, China has just <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64594469\">proposed a list of measures</a> to actively encourage its young women to marry and have children (and not just one child any more: three, ideally). This is a national policy, but it\u2019s one with global benefits: to stem the threat of economic stagnation, growing the population is supposed to ensure the continuity of a <a href=\"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2023/01/17/china-population-decline-birth-rate-global-economy-impact/11066270002/\">huge, and therefore cheap, labour force</a>. In other words, unless more Chinese women have more children, we\u2019ll all have to pay more for our merch \u2013 with matrimony here (never mind that not everyone who marries has children and not everyone who has children gets married) still framed by national governments as the gateway to maternity first of all.
