Because <a href=\"https://www.ispot.tv/ad/qe3S/extra-gum-restaurant\" target=\"_blank\">there's an Extra Gum commercial</a> that drives me insane. This twerp is having an existential crisis when asked by a waiter \"together or separate\" because he doesn't know if he should pay for the date or not. Every time it is on I want to reach through the TV, shove his head in a toilet, and steal his girl.</p><p>But yes. If having a man who is a gentleman and chivalrous is something you desire and are only finding in conservative men, it's because most liberal men are pussies. If you want someone to get your door for you, you might also need to be okay with your date voting for Ron DeSantis.</p><blockquote>And obviously, as a liberal woman, I do wanna be respected for my independence and I do want to have my own autonomy in the relationship and not be combined or conform to the traditional female homemaker childbearing role... I don't want to compromise my morals and values.</blockquote><p>I think I see the problem here. Outside of the few conservative men she accidentally swiped right on, she doesn't know any IRL conservative men OR conservative women. Conservative women have autonomy and independence. Conservative men enjoy cooking. Allow me to blow our friend here's mind. 98% of what she has heard about conservative men and conservative women from TikTok and leftist tabloids like CNN? Complete bullshit.</p><p>Speaking as a conservative man who has dated liberal women before, I'll give her some advice. Just don't talk about politics. And if you do, either be respectful or after you get into a fight about the election, enjoy the make-up sex and go see a movie.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

He started to crossover into the political world during the 2020 summer of riots. When the rest of his team kneeled in solidarity with the Marxist political organization Black Lives Matter, Inc. during the National Anthem, he stood for America. </p><p>Isaac also stood for medical freedom in 2021, by opposing the schmaccine mandates. <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nba-player-makes-perfect-case-for-refusing-the-c-vax-hint-natural-immunity\" target=\"_blank\">He was attacked for it in <em>Rolling Stone</em></a>. Besides rejecting mandates on the grounds of freedom, the anti-science regulations the NBA thrust on players didn't make a lick of sense either. He said in an interview:</p><blockquote><em>\"I don't know all of the regulations that have been laid out. ... I'm not allowed to go to like team functions. Or if the team is eating in a restaurant, I can't eat in the same room as them. To me, it just doesn't logically follow for us then to get on the court together. ...All of this is coming about talking about a virus was such a high survival rate.\"</em></blockquote><h3>\"Retail brands have the freedom to go woke. We have the freedom to create an alternative.\"</h3><br /><p>Isaac says, \"You have companies that are in that field who have made a conscious decision to either attack or undermine Christian values, conservative values, and things like that. And I think they have the free choice to do so, as much as I disagree, but I feel that we also have the freedom to create what we want to create.\"</p><p>The plan is to sign athletes from all sports. He wants to provide alternatives for young sports fans and their parents so that they know if they are spending their hard-earned money on something it isn't going to a company that hates them.</p><p>\"The hope is to create a real infrastructure of people who are in the sports world [for] moms and dads who want to buy their kids sneakers and clothes but want to give their money to a company that they know is going to bloster their values.\"</p><p class=\"\">This shows promise. Let's be honest. Any time there is a \"Christian\" or \"Conservative\" alternative brand, it tends to be another c-word. Corny. Isaac being a professional athlete lends authenticity to make Unitus a \"legit\" brand as opposed to just a Christan and/or conservative one. I'm optimistic about this.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

There was a lot of <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/best-nikki-haley-beatdowns-2017\" target=\"_blank\">SLAY KWEEN'ING over Haley in 2017</a> when she was Donald Trump's Ambassador to the UN. Then she threw Trump under the bus after January 6th when she thought that's what people were doing. Then when she realized that wasn't what people were doing tried to flip back. Now she is an example of the old GOP guard that we don't need anymore.</p><p>HOWEVER, conservatives have been waiting for someone to answer the abortion question like this for some time. Haley was asked to pinpoint on what week her abortion restrictions would begin.</p><h3>So what did she say?</h3><br /><blockquote>I will answer that when you ask Kamala and Biden if they would agree to 37 weeks, 38 weeks, 39 weeks, then I\u2019ll answer your question. No one asks them that. No one asks them how late they\u2019re willing to go.</blockquote><p>Please note that \"Rupar\" <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=rupar\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">is a verb meaning</a> to <em>\"purposely mislead, To intentionally and grossly mischaracterize a statement and/or video.\"</em> Hence Rupar letting the point sail over his head and claiming this video is about Nikki \"refusing\" to answer an abortion ban question. Her \"not\" answering was the answer.</p><p><a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2023/06/04/when-you-ask-kamala-and-biden-nikki-haley-smacks-down-jake-tapper-over-abortion-question-during-cnn-town-hall/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Missing from this clip</a> is Jake Tapper being all like \"I think Biden and Harris have been clear that they don\u2019t support any restrictions\" and Nikki clapping back all like \"They said abortion up to the time of birth, right?\"</p><h3>Did they really though?</h3><br /><p>Neither Biden nor Kamala said that because neither Biden nor Kamala -- or any Democrat -- are asked to get that specific. Republicans are deemed \"extreme\" for saying that maaaaaaybe somewhere between six and twelve weeks is enough time to decide if you're going to abort your choice.</p><p>What is the SPECIFIC Democrat position on the other end? 37 weeks? 40 weeks? Just before the birthing person starts crowning? Do they support Cartman's mom wanting to abort her child in the fortieth trimester? Remember, Democrats are also the party of government-assisted suicide. If you think that is too far of a stretch, you probably think there would never be a time where Democrats said men could have babies.</p><p>Nikki Haley is spot on about Democrats needing to be held to SPECIFICS when it comes to their pro-abortion agenda. Hopefully, either Ron DeSantis or Donald Trump remembers to put Joe Biden on the spot during the presidential debates.</p><p class=\"\">><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.
