<p>To say that Apple's WWDC 2023 keynote <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-wwdc-2023-live-updates-160004876.html">was packed</a> would be an understatement. The company introduced the Vision Pro, its first foray into mixed reality headsets, as well as a 15-inch MacBook Air. There was also an updated Mac Studio and Mac Pro, both of which use the equally new M2 Ultra chip. As you'd expect Apple announced significant upgrades to all its software platforms.</p><h2>Apple Vision Pro</h2><figure><img alt="Apple Vision Pro headset at WWDC 2023" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/1c918630-03e4-11ee-9d6f-24d7c860a38c" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>It's safe to say the Vision Pro was Apple's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-vision-pro-first-look-spatial-computing-future-201844231.html">marquee device</a> at WWDC. It's a standalone mixed reality headset with very powerful specs, including an M2 chip (plus an R1 companion chip), 4K displays for each eye and nearly a dozen cameras and sensors that allow for hand gesture input and 3D photography. There's even an external screen that shows your eyes and notifies others when you're using apps.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Vision Pro runs visionOS, a new platform designed from the ground up for spatial computing. It centers on a mixed reality 3D interface that makes apps, FaceTime calls and other tasks effectively float in physical space. You can control your Mac, play games and run iPad apps using a virtual screen. Disney is even planning a suite of experiences that include a Disney+ app.</p><p>The headset won't be cheap. Apple will sell Vision Pro for $3,499, and it won't be available until early 2024. This is a wearable computer for developers, and Apple is pricing it accordingly.</p><h2>15-inch MacBook Air</h2><figure><img alt="Apple 15-inch MacBook Air" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/7222d1b0-03e6-11ee-a9dd-a6bdc3083037" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>Apple's first hardware announcement at WWDC might also have been the most important one for everyday users. The company launched the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-finally-announces-the-15-inch-macbook-air-170715355.html">15-inch MacBook Air</a>, its first truly large laptop aimed at everyday users. It has the same fanless M2 chip, MagSafe connector and twin Thunderbolt 4 ports as its 13-inch counterpart, just with a 15.3-inch display and a longer 18-hour battery life. It's billed as the &quot;world's thinnest&quot; 15-inch laptop at 0.45in thick, and relatively light at 3.3lbs.</p><p>The 15-inch MacBook Air ships on June 13th starting at $1,299. And if it's larger than you need, Apple has cut the price of the 13-inch Air to $1,099.</p><h2>Mac Pro and Mac Studio with M2 Ultra</h2><figure><img alt="Apple Mac Studio and Mac Pro with M2 Ultra" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/af6c1990-03e7-11ee-bff8-71bf4e2b2a25" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>It took three years, but Apple has finally finished transitioning its computer line to in-house silicon. The company has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-refreshes-the-mac-pro-with-its-new-m2-ultra-chip-173145016.html">introduced</a> a Mac Pro that uses a brand new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-announces-m2-ultra-chip-with-double-the-cpu-and-gpu-cores-171204873.html">M2 Ultra</a> system-on-chip at its heart. While the workstation shares the same cheese grater look as its Intel-based predecessor, the 24-core CPU, 76-core GPU chip is reportedly up to three times faster. You can't upgrade the RAM yourself, unfortunately, but seven PCIe slots and eight Thunderbolt 4 ports promise the expansion heavy-duty users demand.</p><p>The Mac Studio, meanwhile, is a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-upgraded-mac-studio-includes-the-m2-max-or-m2-ultra-chip-171527954.html">straightforward refresh</a> of last year's compact pro machine. It comes in M2 Max and M2 Ultra configurations with a higher-bandwidth HDMI port that supports up to an 8K resolution and 240Hz refresh rates.</p><p>Both systems are due to ship June 13th. The upgraded Mac Studio starts at $1,999, while the Mac Pro begins at $6,599.</p><h2>iOS 17</h2><h2></h2><figure><img alt="Apple iOS 17" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/6fb4f610-03d2-11ee-a7f5-0f1c703704b3" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-ios-17-revamps-core-apps-172548767.html">unveiled</a> iOS 17 at WWDC, and this upgrade focuses as much on basic apps as it does extending the iPhone's functionality. Calls now include contact-specific &quot;posters,&quot; with live transcripts for voicemail. Messages offers a sleeker interface, transcripts, a more powerful sticker feature and location-based check-ins with friends. FaceTime lets you leave video messages. Sharing has improved with proximity-based data and contact sharing, plus AirPlay sharing in hotels and to in-car infotainment systems. Siri is more powerful with support for back-to-back commands that don't involve the &quot;Siri&quot; keyword, and autocorrect includes sentence-level correction as well as predictions.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-new-journal-app-will-help-you-kickstart-a-daily-diary-habit-174402869.html">new Journal app</a> in iOS 17 lets you document your activities and thoughts, while mood tracking in Health can help you identify medically relevant emotional changes. Your iPhone can also double as a smart display through StandBy, which shows useful info on widgets while your phone is in landscape mode.</p><p>iOS 17 is due in the fall, although a developer preview is available now. A public beta will be ready in July. Notably, Apple is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-17-drops-support-for-iphone-8-and-x-200718892.html">dropping support</a> for the iPhone 8 and iPhone X with this release.</p><h2>iPadOS 17</h2><figure><img alt="Apple iPadOS 17" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/c4e4e5b0-03ea-11ee-bb7b-fb7a2c4f5765" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>If iOS 17 is about revamping the iPhone experience, iPadOS 17 is about catching up. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ipados-17-gets-a-customizable-lock-screen-interactive-widgets-and-apple-health-174748297.html">newly-announced</a> iPad update adds iOS 16-style lock screen customization, complete with widgets. Those widgets are now interactive on the tablet, though, letting you take actions without jumping into apps. Health is also available on the iPad for the first time, and takes advantage of new iOS features like mood tracking.</p><p>The Notes app will let you annotate and collaborate on PDFs for the first time. Stage Manager multitasking will give you more control over windows, and you can use an external monitor's webcam for video calls. iOS 17's Journal app, contact posters and Messages refresh will be available here as well.</p><p>iPadOS 17 doesn't arrive until the fall, but a developer preview is available now.

The new OS includes a Smart Stack of widgets for timers, podcasts and other content you can quickly access by spinning the Digital Crown. Key apps like Activity and World Clock are adding more functionality, too. Cyclists will appreciate bike sensor support as well as heart rate and power data, while hikers may like automatic waypoint creation  for emergencies as well as topographical maps (including trail searching) and 3D waypoints.</p><p>Other additions are more in line with iOS and iPadOS. The Mindfulness app now includes mood tracking, and you'll get outdoor time tracking to help prevent nearsightedness. You can view FaceTime video messages and join FaceTime group audio chats. If you're a Fitness+ subscriber, you'll have custom workout and meditation schedules.</p><p>A developer preview of watchOS 10 is available now, with a public beta arriving in July.

The refresh adds interactive desktop widgets  that can sync with your iPhone. Video calls get an upgrade with a presenter overlay, reactions and improved screen sharing.

## Apple MacBook Air 15-inch preview: Portable power

<p>In addition to a slew of Macs, new Silicon and a compelling <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-vision-pro-first-look-spatial-computing-future-201844231.html">new Vision Pro headset</a>, Apple also introduced a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-finally-announces-the-15-inch-macbook-air-170715355.html">15-inch MacBook Air</a> at its Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) today. The larger MacBook Air not only offers a bigger display than its 13-inch counterpart, but it also comes with a more sophisticated sound system and battery life that's rated for hours longer. I was able to pick one up to see how it feels here at Apple Park today, though I wasn't allowed to do much else with it.&nbsp;</p><p>I do like how thin and light the new MacBook Air is — at 11.5mm (0.45inches) thin and 3.3 pounds (1.49 kgs), it beats the Dell XPS 15, which is both heavier and thicker. Apple's machine has a slightly smaller 15.3-inch Liquid Retina Display, though, whereas Dell's comes in at 15.6 inches.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The 15-inch MacBook Air's screen can get up to 500 nits of brightness, and though I never got a chance to view it outdoors, the photos and interfaces I did see were lovely and crisp. Colors were vibrant and rich, and when an Apple rep showed me photos of long-haired dogs and a woman in a red dress in front of some cliffs, the details were tack sharp.</p><p>I also got to see how the laptop handles tasks like photo-editing and gaming, which thanks to its M2 chip happened impressively quickly. An Apple rep used Photonator to erase multiple kayaks from a topdown photo of canoes on a river, and also changed the colors of certain parts of the image. Everything happened instantly and accurately. They also showed me part of a game called <em>Stray</em> so I could see how the laptop handled the graphics rendering of things like light reflecting off a puddle. These were very controlled demos, so while they all did perform well and without lag, I would rather evaluate the MacBook Air based on our own realworld testing.</p><p>I did get to check out the new six-speaker sound system with spatial audio when a rep played some songs for me, including Beyonce's <em>Cuff It</em>. Unfortunately, because the demo space we were in was fairly noisy, it was hard to gauge how well the audio sounded. I stuck my ear right next to the machine and was only barely able to hear the song. This is another feature we'll have to wait for a review unit to test for ourselves.</p><p>I wasn't able to do much else with the new laptop, really, but here's a quick recap of some of its features. It has the same notch design from the 13-inch MacBook Air that houses its 1080p webcam, but unlike the smaller model, this year's device comes with a 10-core GPU across the board instead of 8 cores. It also ships with the dual-port 35W charger by default and has a larger trackpad.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're intrigued, you can order the 15-inch MacBook Air today, starting at $1,299, and it'll be available in stores on June 13th.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Apple's WWDC 2023 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/wwdc-2023/"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-15-inch-preview-portable-power-213455527.html?src=rss

## Apple Vision Pro first look: A glimpse at the spatial computing future

<p>Apple isn't letting us try on its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-vision-pro-is-apples-long-awaited-arvr-headset-182725385.html">Vision Pro mixed reality headset</a> just yet, but I was able to briefly glimpse the hardware after fighting through the crowds at WWDC. And, well, it looks like yet another headset — almost like a souped up version of the Meta Quest Pro. But even with just a short glance, it's clear that the Vision Pro is pure Apple: It's like seeing the iPod compared to the clunky MP3 players of its era, or the iPhone next to a BlackBerry.&nbsp;</p><p>The Vision Pro is Apple's bold entry into the world of spatial computing, and it seems like the company has learned a lot from the VR and AR headsets before it. The front of the device features an OLED screen that can display your eyes, making you more connected to the people in the real world. Its springy side bands and ribbed rear headband look like suitably high-end. And, simply put, it has the wow factor you'd expect from a prestige Apple product.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="dbdd659ae66049ea9c21e1e5d7bd4a67"><div><div style="width: 100%; height: 0;"></div></div></div><p>Still, there's some reason for concern. The required battery pack is a bit un-Apple, since you'll have to stuff it into your pocket or find somewhere to store it. And we've yet to see someone wearing this headset in the real world. Apple's event staff stressed that we couldn't touch the Vision Pro or lean too close. Of course, we won't see if Apple's spatial computing vision lives up to its slick promotional videos until we can actually wear this thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Apple's WWDC 2023 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/wwdc-2023/"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apple-vision-pro-first-look-spatial-computing-future-201844231.html?src=rss

<p>Like clockwork, Apple will release the latest operating systems for its various products this fall. And, as ever, the company will leave some older generations of its devices <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-wwdc-2022-ios-ipados-macos-watchos-supported-devices-200156650.html">by the wayside</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're still clinging onto an iPhone 8 (that thing was great, so I don't blame you), iPhone 8 Plus or an iPhone X, you won't be able to update it to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-ios-17-revamps-core-apps-172548767.html">iOS 17</a>. In other words, your iPhone will need to have an A12 Bionic or later chip to install the new OS. If you have an iPhone XR, XS, XS Max, iPhone SE (second-gen) or later, you'll have access to features including Live Voicemail transcripts, the StandBy display mode and, at ducking last, better autocorrect.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Apple is adding customizable lock screens, the Health app, interactive widgets and much more to the iPad. Unfortunately, folks using a fifth-generation iPad or the first-gen 12.9-inch iPad Pro will not be able to install <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ipados-17-gets-a-customizable-lock-screen-interactive-widgets-and-apple-health-174748297.html">iPadOS 17</a>.

There are upgrades to the Cycling and Compass apps, along with a slew of other updates.</p><p>Widgets are also coming to the Mac via <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macos-sonoma-brings-widgets-to-the-desktop-180459498.html">macOS Sonoma</a>. Along with other features, the desktop and laptop operating system will feature a new Game Mode that prioritizes CPU and GPU performance to deliver higher framerates for every game.

<p>Apple's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-vision-pro-is-apples-long-awaited-arvr-headset-182725385.html">Vision Pro headset</a> will introduce a new approach to security in the company's products: your eyes.

<p>Apple's new mixed reality headset may have stolen the show at WWDC, but it was not the only piece of tech the company announced. Apple debuted a 15-inch MacBook Air today that will join the classic 13-inch model as the iPhone maker's thinnest and lightest notebooks. The company is positioning the larger model as the ideal 15-inch laptop, boasting that it has a better balance of performance, features and battery life than any 15-inch PC notebook. Here's how you can order the 15-inch MacBook Air, plus the rest of the readily available products announced at WWDC 2023.</p><h2>Apple MacBook Air 15</h2><p></p><p><a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0MTMwZTJmMC1hMTRmLTRjNWUtYmRhYi1jZDUyYWM3ZDhlNzkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL21hYy8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjFjZWY4YmVhLTNhZTItNDNlMi1iNThiLWMyYjFkOWE2ZDA4MyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAffmuA11wjIchILLTqxRCjX9uVpT0rkGESEpWeWtwFwr&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fmac%2F">Apple's 15-inch MacBook Air</a> is available to order today starting at $1,299 and will be widely available on June 13th.

The new laptop has a 15.3-inch Liquid Retina display that's surrounded by 5mm borders and only interrupted by a notch that includes a 1080p webcam for video calls. Its profile is similar to that of the 13-inch model, with rounded square corners, and it measures only 11.5mm thick and weighs 3.3 pounds. Unsurprisingly, such a svelte design doesn't leave a lot of space for ports. The 15-inch MacBook Air has just two Thunderbolt ports on one side, along with a MagSafe charging port, and a headphone jack on the other edge. The 15-inch Air will likely have similar performance to the 13-inch model since it runs on the same chipset, so it should be plenty fast for most people. Apple claims the larger laptop will get 18 hours of battery life as well.</p><h2>Mac Studio &amp; Mac Pro</h2><p></p><p></p><p>The <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0MTMwZTJmMC1hMTRmLTRjNWUtYmRhYi1jZDUyYWM3ZDhlNzkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL21hYy1zdHVkaW8vIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIxY2VmOGJlYS0zYWUyLTQzZTItYjU4Yi1jMmIxZDlhNmQwODMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAW3LJySaqzqO4uUZhtep-lRARNli-wNwZ9dRwrNYsL2L&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fmac-studio%2F">Mac Studio</a> and Mac Pro are available to order today starting at $1,999 and $6,999, respectively.

The biggest thing to note about this upgrade is that it can run on the new M2 Max or M2 Ultra chips, which Apple claims will excel at laborious tasks like 8K video editing, 3D modeling and the like. Apple claims the M2 Max version of the Mac Studio will be 50 percent faster than its predecessor, and the M2 Ultra version will be twice as fast as that.</p><p>As for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-refreshes-the-mac-pro-with-its-new-m2-ultra-chip-173145016.html">Mac Pro</a>, it remains a very expensive and very powerful desktop that will have even better performance thanks to the M2 Ultra chip. It'll come with a 24-core CPU and it will support up to a 76-core GPU and up to 192GB of memory. In addition to that, the Mac Pro will come with seven PCIe expansion slots, seven Thunderbolt 4 ports, two 10GB Ethernet ports, three USB-A slots and two HDMI connectors that can output 8K resolution at 240Hz. Needless to say, this is overkill for most people, not to mention its sky-high price tag will put it out of reach for most consumers.</p><h2>Apple Vision Pro</h2><p>Apple debuted its long-awaited mixed reality headset, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-vision-pro-is-apples-long-awaited-arvr-headset-182725385.html">Vision Pro</a>, at WWDC 2023. The headset looks much like the VR headsets we're used to seeing from the likes of Facebook and Sony, but with a unique Apple spin. The Vision Pro is a standalone device that doesn't need a physical controller — instead, users operate it using a mix of hand gestures, voice input and the built-in Digital Crown on the headset. Apple showed off a number of uses cases for the Vision Pro including using with your Mac to expand your screen real estate, using Vision Pro apps alongside Mac apps, watch 3D movies and content from services like Disney+ and play games from Apple Arcade. But unlike the other hardware mention here, Vision Pro is not available today — it'll be available in early 2024 starting at $3,499.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Apple's WWDC 2023 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/wwdc-2023/"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/how-to-order-the-15-inch-apple-macbook-air-190535960.html?src=rss

<p>Apple's Vision Pro mixed reality headset will run on visionOS, company executives announced following <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-vision-pro-is-apples-long-awaited-arvr-headset-182725385.html">the bombshell reveal of its long-rumored wearable</a> at WWDC 2023. The operating system, internally codenamed "Oak," has reportedly been in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/11/08/apple-augmented-reality-headset-2020/">development since 2017</a>.

The new headset will an immersive mixed-reality 3D interface that, "frees apps from the boundaries of a display," <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0MTMwZTJmMC1hMTRmLTRjNWUtYmRhYi1jZDUyYWM3ZDhlNzkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL25ld3Nyb29tLzIwMjMvMDYvaW50cm9kdWNpbmctYXBwbGUtdmlzaW9uLXByby8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjJjMzYzNDU1LTMwZDgtNDk3MC1hNzI3LTAwOWU2NjVmNzFhOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQ2DfOtd7UqobWkqdOZila0XoAhHiwS9WQ1-okfZ8cqI&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2023%2F06%2Fintroducing-apple-vision-pro%2F">according the the company</a>.

Apple is already working with a number of media companies to bring their products and content into the new Vision Pro ecosystem. This includes Disney which, as part of its 100th anniversary celebration, announced Monday that it will bring immersive features to Disney+ content, "by combining extraordinary creativity with groundbreaking technology," Disney CEO Bob Iger said. "Disney+ will be available 'day one,' [of the headset's availability]."

## Safari gets major privacy updates and the ability to put web apps in your dock

<p>Safari might not be the most exciting part of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macos-sonoma-brings-widgets-to-the-desktop-180459498.html">macOS</a>, but Apple isn't giving its web browser the cold shoulder. The latest version includes a number of useful improvements, including better privacy controls, encryption features, and the ability to create &quot;apps&quot; from any web page.&nbsp;</p><p>The splashiest feature might be the new web apps. This puts a website in your dock on macOS, just like any other app and opens it with a minimal interface that helps mask the fact that you're just using a webpage in a browser. If this sounds similar, that's because it's almost exactly like shortcuts in Google's Chrome which can also put a link, complete with a favicon in your dock and opens the site in a simple frame with none of the normal browser controls. This helps blur the line between desktop and web apps, which was part of Chrome's whole pitch, especially as it grew into Chrome OS.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The more important improvements to Safari though, are to privacy not just on macOS, but iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 as well. Now private browsing blocks more trackers and your fingerprints from sites so they can't identify you. You can also now lock private browsing sessions behind your fingerprint, so you can step away from your computer without worrying that someone can sneak a peak while you're shopping for a gift or having to close your session.</p><p>Profiles on macOS and iPadOS also allow you to separate your browsing by topic or context. So you could, for example, keep all your work tabs in a separate Safari window that has its own cookies, extensions and favorites. Then you can quickly switch to your personal profile to pick up where you left off trolling eBay for deals on vintage cameras.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, users will be able to share passwords or groups of passwords through iCloud Keychain with end-to-end encryption. The latest version of Safari will be available later this year as part of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macos-sonoma-brings-widgets-to-the-desktop-180459498.html">macOS Sonoma</a> which will be launching in beta next month as well as iPad OS 17 and iOS17.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Apple's WWDC 2023 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/wwdc-2023/"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/safari-gets-major-privacy-updates-and-the-ability-to-put-web-apps-in-your-dock-183749938.html?src=rss

<p>Apple gave a look at its latest accessibility and health updates during its annual WWDC on Monday, including new voice and and assistive tech features. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-assistive-access-simplifies-ios-16-for-people-with-cognitive-disabilities-120012723.html">Initially previewed</a> for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/engadget-podcast-how-apple-and-google-are-highlighting-accessibility-123058124.html">Global Accessibility Awareness Day in May</a>, the WWDC announcement confirmed that the new features will launch with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-ios-17-revamps-core-apps-172548767.html">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ipados-17-gets-a-customizable-lock-screen-interactive-widgets-and-apple-health-174748297.html">iPadOS 17</a>, watchOS 10 and macOS Sonoma.&nbsp;</p><p>For iOS users with cognitive disabilities, Apple's new Assistive Access features lets people customize apps with high contrast buttons and large text labels to meet their individual needs. Apple also added Live Speech and Personal Voice for people who are unable to speak, have trouble speaking or may lose their voice over time.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With Live Speech, you can type what you want to say and have it spoken out loud to others on a phone or FaceTime call or jot down commonly used phrases to select during conversation to avoid any delay that comes with typing out in the moment. Personal Voice creates a voice that sounds like you by recording 15 minutes of random phrases. As an example, Apple wrote in a May release that people with ALS or other conditions that impact speech can save their voice to their device to use with Live Speech and other assistive tech as their condition progresses.&nbsp;</p><p>Other new accessibility updates include a Point and Speak feature to read the text on household object aloud. This can be used by people who are blind or have low vision to identify text on objects in their surroundings, like buttons on a microwave.</p><p>New health features like it's daylight sensor and screen distance detection targeted at kids are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-kid-friendly-features-reduce-eye-strain-wwdc-182620428.html">intended to prevent vision problems like myopia</a>.

<p>The Apple headset is one of the company's most anticipated products with leaks and rumors <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-08/apple-is-said-to-ramp-up-work-on-augmented-reality-headset#xj4y7vzkg">dating back to 2017.</a> But after years of speculation, today at WWDC 2023 Apple has finally given us a real look at the device that it's now calling the Vision Pro.</p><p>Created to support both AR and VR applications, the Vision Pro is a standalone device featuring an innovative design without the need for a dedicated controller. Instead, thanks to the use of multiple external sensors and cameras, Apple is planning to rely entirely on voice inputs and hand gestures. On top of that, Apple has created a new feature called EyeSight that uses an exterior display and the headset's internal cameras so that people can see a user's reactions while someone is wearing the headset.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="The Apple Vision Pro headset features an external battery to help reduce its weight. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/126dc2b0-03d3-11ee-b7f3-afb2dddb3f5e" style="height: 1161px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>Designed to be as light as possible, the Vision Pro is machined from a custom aluminum alloy, while a digital crown lets users easily adjust their level of immersion. Meanwhile, the headband has been created to accommodate a range of head sizes while still being soft, comfortable and easy to adjust. And built into the headband are dual-driver audio pods on either side that provide spatial audio. Critically, to reduce the weight of the headset even further, the Vision Pro features an external battery that's connected to the headset with a wire.&nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to optics, the Vision Pro uses a proprietary three-element lens with high-res micro OLED displays that Apple says deliver extremely high fidelity. On the inside, there are both IR cameras and LED illuminators, while the exterior of the device features both LiDAR and traditional camera sensors. And powering the entire headset is Apple's Vision OS, which works with the company's new R1 chip and an M2 processor to deliver responsive, &quot;lag-free&quot; standalone performance.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="Apple Vision Pro crown." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/e2f16ad0-03cf-11ee-bdb0-7add50a471c9" style="height: 1161px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>Additionally, you can use familiar apps like Safari and others while still being able to interact with objects or people in the real world. And while the Vision Pro has been designed for use at home, Apple says thanks to new versions of familiar apps like FaceTime, the headset is also a great collaboration tool for those on the road.&nbsp;</p><p>Another feature of the Vision Pro is the inclusion of Apple's first 3D camera. Apple says the camera can be used to capture special moments with added depth information, while also making it clear when a person is or isn't recording footage. Alternatively, if you just want to use the headset as a fancy way to watch TV or movies, there's a dedicated mode for watching videos that allows you to change the size of the content on demand. As for gaming, Apple says the Vision Pro supports more than 100 different games from the Apple Arcade library with the system also able to pair with a PS5 or Xbox controller as needed.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="A side view of the Apple Vision Pro's ear pods and headband.

That said, while it appears that a lot of these demos are still a work in progress, Disney CEO Bog Iger announced that the Disney+ app will be available on the Vision Pro at launch.&nbsp;</p><p>The Vision Pro is slated to go on sale sometime early next year for $3,499.</p><p></p><p><em>This is a developing story.

<p>Apple gave a look at features targeted at reducing eye strain for kids during its annual WWDC on Monday, including a daylight sensor and alerts to move the screen farther away from your eyes. The feature comes after Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-assistive-access-simplifies-ios-16-for-people-with-cognitive-disabilities-120012723.html">initially previewed</a> more health and accessibility features for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/engadget-podcast-how-apple-and-google-are-highlighting-accessibility-123058124.html">Global Accessibility Awareness Day in May</a>. While the features can be used by anyone, Apple said they're targeted at kids because myopia, commonly known as nearsightedness, usually develops in childhood and affects about 30% of the US population, according to <a href="https://www.aoa.org/healthy-eyes/eye-and-vision-conditions/myopia?sso=y#:~:text=Myopia%20occurs%20if%20the%20eyeball,30%25%20of%20the%20U.S.%20population.">the American Optometric Association</a>.</p><p>At WWDC, Apple said spending more time outdoors in the daylight can <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0MTMwZTJmMC1hMTRmLTRjNWUtYmRhYi1jZDUyYWM3ZDhlNzkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL25ld3Nyb29tLzIwMjMvMDYvaW50cm9kdWNpbmctd2F0Y2hvcy0xMC1hLW1pbGVzdG9uZS11cGRhdGUtZm9yLWFwcGxlLXdhdGNoLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzc0MDRjODAtNDZmYy00YjRiLTkwODctNzQxNWU3OGQ3MGRiIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAda2KGYeFW0PvLLsZ47a9PmX6HCn0mUiP1VOwwOlodWx&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2023%2F06%2Fintroducing-watchos-10-a-milestone-update-for-apple-watch%2F">help reduce a child's risk of developing nearsightedness</a>. A new Apple Watch feature will use the ambient light sensor to measure how much time the wearer spends outside. That data will show up in the Health app, and in Health Sharing for families so that parents and guardians can access the information for kids without iPhones.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Apple explained that kids with an Apple Watch can connect to their parent or guardian's iPhone to share health data, like how much time is spent in the daylight." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/f90322f0-03cf-11ee-970e-5ba918be6b8e" style="height: 1161px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>Another effort to reduce myopia risk is Apple's new screen distance detection.

<p>Apple took to the stage at WWDC today to announce that video-calling service FaceTime is <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0MTMwZTJmMC1hMTRmLTRjNWUtYmRhYi1jZDUyYWM3ZDhlNzkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL25ld3Nyb29tLzIwMjMvMDYvdHZvcy0xNy1icmluZ3MtZmFjZXRpbWUtYW5kLXZpZGVvLWNvbmZlcmVuY2luZy10by1hcHBsZS10di00ay8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjQ3MGZlMDJiLWU4MTktNGZhYi1hMjVlLTUyMGYxMWU1OGJiNCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAASbBCJ86YhGoVtEMVMCfPFhjU72qWuXEsZuOq4hL6QCn&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2023%2F06%2Ftvos-17-brings-facetime-and-video-conferencing-to-apple-tv-4k%2F">finally coming to Apple TV hardware</a> for the first time, thanks to a robust tvOS update. This seems to be a full-featured version of the company’s proprietary live-streaming app that takes full advantage of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-continuity-webcam-iphone-mac-facetime-184540330.html">recently-released Continuity Camera feature.</a></p><p>For the uninitiated, this feature lets you use your iPhone as a replacement webcam for your laptop, so you’ll now be able to use your iPhone or iPad as the primary camera for TV-based FaceTime conversations. Apple says wireless integration happens automatically and that the service can also use the phone or tablet’s microphone when joining or initiating a call. The company says the software has been designed so that you always remain in the center of the frame. You can also quickly switch the feed between devices with just a swipe and interact using gestures. FaceTime will be available for Apple TV 4K devices starting this fall.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>FaceTime is the main draw of tvOS 17, but not the only improvement. The company redesigned the control center to make it more intuitive and, more importantly, added Find My Remote support.

Apple also noted that video conferencing apps like Webex by Cisco and Zoom will launch on tvOS later this year.&nbsp;</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/facetime-is-coming-to-apple-tv-182616297.html?src=rss

<p>Apple announced new audio features coming for AirPods users. The standout feature is Adaptive Audio, which will tune your device’s active noise cancelation (ANC) and transparency mode based on your environment. In addition, the company says it’s adding personalized volume, which uses on-device machine learning to predict your desired volume, as well as automatically lowering volume and focusing on the conversation at hand when you begin speaking. The updates also make AirPods device-switching “significantly faster.”</p><p><em>This is a developing story.

<p>Your <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/apple-watch/">Apple Watch</a> will look very different in the near future. Among the many announcements <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/apple/">Apple</a> made during its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/wwdc-2023/">WWDC keynote</a> was one related to watchOS 10. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-is-reportedly-redesigning-watchos-around-widgets-162720331.html">As expected,</a> the company is giving the smartwatch user interface an overhaul as part of perhaps the firmware's biggest update yet.</p><p>You may recall that the original Apple Watch UI was designed, in part, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-04-30-apple-watch-review.html">around Glances</a> — a carousel of widgets for different apps and features. Apple eventually moved away from Glances to place more emphasis on apps, but now the company is looking to make widgets a larger focus of the Watch interface again.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Widget on WatchOS 10" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/413ea3e0-03cc-11ee-9fd3-4f5e9da21729" style="height: 1161px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>It seems to work in a similar way to the Siri watch face that's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-05-apple-watchos-4.html">long been available on Apple Watch</a>.

<p>The latest update to macOS is called Sonoma and it's all about productivity and widget management. The new operating system adds widgets to the desktop and makes them movable, allowing users to place them anywhere. As one widget is in use, the others will fade into the background.</p><p>Sonoma — or, macOS 14 — will also communicate with widgets on your iPhone, with no need to install them directly on the desktop, via a feature called Continuity. With your iOS device nearby, you'll be able to access all of your phone's widgets on desktop.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="macOS Sonoma" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/5eef1cf0-03ca-11ee-bffd-9c15feef9ff6" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>Sonoma also features improvements in Mac gaming power.

There's no mention of any changes, but it's safe to presume you'll want an Apple Silicon-based Mac to make the most of the title.</p><p>As on other platforms, this edition of <em>Death Stranding</em> is ultimately a refinement of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-07-death-stranding-is-a-great-movie.html">the 2019 original</a>. You'll see new missions, more boss fights, updated combat mechanics and activities like racing and a shooting range.

## iPadOS 17 gets a customizable lock screen, interactive widgets and Apple Health

<p>As usual, Apple is unveiling a major set of updates for iPadOS. This year, we're on to iPadOS 17, and as expected it features a host of changes that have already been shown of for the iPhone in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-ios-17-revamps-core-apps-172548767.html">iOS 17</a>, plus some updates specific to the tablet.&nbsp;</p><p>For starters, widgets are now interactive, which means you can update them and take actions without necessarily jumping right into the app. You can start playing music via the Music widget, check off reminders, update smart home features and so forth.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Unsurprisingly, iPadOS 17 is also getting the lock screen redesign that Apple pushed to the iPhone last year with iOS 16. This lets you add widgets to the home screen, assign different focus modes to specific wallpapers, change the fonts of the clock and text and more. There's also a pretty cool Live Photo feature that animates your wallpaper when you wake the iPad.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple is also bringing the Health app to the iPad for the first time. Naturally, it syncs data from the Health app on your phone and Apple Watch, but it looks like you can use it standalone as well if you don't have that other hardware.</p><p>PDF support is coming to the Notes app, which might not sound like the most exciting thing ever. But Notes is a pretty powerful app, and having it host PDFs for annotation could be quite useful. There's even a live collaboration feature that lets two people work on a shared PDF at the same time, and changes are reflected as both of you work.</p><p>Stage Manager is getting some improvements, too, giving you more flexibility for placing windows. This feature was a key bit of iPadOS 16, and it's good to see that Apple is answering some requests that people have had over the year.</p><p>Naturally, a lot of the same updates that are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-ios-17-revamps-core-apps-172548767.html">coming to iOS 17</a> will be here, as well. That includes an improved Messages experience, customizable contact posters, and the brand-new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-new-journal-app-will-help-you-kickstart-a-daily-diary-habit-174402869.html">Journal</a> app.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Apple's WWDC 2023 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/wwdc-2023/"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ipados-17-gets-a-customizable-lock-screen-interactive-widgets-and-apple-health-174748297.html?src=rss

<p>Apple has a new diary app landing on iOS devices. Simply called “Journal,” the app is meant to help you keep tabs on daily moments you might want to remember or otherwise reflect on. The app is set to debut later this year following the rollout of iOS 17.</p><p>The app’s existence was <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2f007401-3eaa-4237-b69b-54ccbe125502&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Wall+Street+Journal&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyZjAwNzQwMS0zZWFhLTQyMzctYjY5Yi01NGNjYmUxMjU1MDIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9hcHBsZS1wbGFucy1pcGhvbmUtam91cm5hbGluZy1hcHAtaW4tZXhwYW5zaW9uLW9mLWhlYWx0aC1pbml0aWF0aXZlcy02OTBiMmM4YiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZGI2MzAzOGQtYmYzMS00NjNjLTljOGItZTdjNWNlN2EyNGQwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAATCQjcKj0kAkiVJc__CF_zirm-L5Phw0WoeYu9R8Gv3S&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Fapple-plans-iphone-journaling-app-in-expansion-of-health-initiatives-690b2c8b"><ins>reported</ins></a> in April by <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, which compared it to Day One, a journaling app that’s been popular for more than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-02-27-day-one-a-beautiful-and-functional-cross-platform-journaling-ap.html"><ins>a decade</ins></a>.

Because the app can pull details from other apps, like Messages and Podcasts, it can automatically suggest moments you may want to reflect on.</p><p>For example, if you completed a workout using the Fitness app, or listened to a new podcast episode, Journal could remind you of these activities in its “intelligently curated” writing prompts and suggestions. Or if you took a trip to the beach, Journal could automatically pull in any related photos similar to the “memory” collages created in the Photos app.</p><p>The company also plans to offer an API for developers who want to tie their apps into Journal’s curated suggestions. Those kinds of integrations between apps could prompt privacy concerns, but the company said it created the app with users’ privacy in mind. The app is end-to-end encrypted, with all information stored locally on users’ devices. Users can also control which apps will have details appear in Journal’s suggestions.</p><p><em>This is a developing story.

<p>Apple confirmed at its WWDC conference today that its largest and most powerful desktop will be receiving a few upgrades, including the M2 Ultra chip. While it's been through several aesthetic variations over the years, including the maligned "trashcan" model, the new Mac Pro will look identical to its cheese grater-like predecessor from 2019.</p><p>Other lines of Mac products have moved away from using third-party silicon, and now the hulking Mac Pro joins them. Its former Intel Xeon W setup has been replaced with the aforementioned M2 Ultra. Apple claims its in-house chip can operate up to three times faster than the prior Intel models. As was rumored though, the decision to develop a specialized M2 Extreme chip <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/2022-mac-pro/">was shelved</a> due to cost and technical difficulty. The Mac Pro will now come stocked with a 24-core CPU and up to a 76-core GPU. It support up to 192GB of memory, and seven Afterburner cards. That combined power, the company <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0MTMwZTJmMC1hMTRmLTRjNWUtYmRhYi1jZDUyYWM3ZDhlNzkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL25ld3Nyb29tLzIwMjMvMDYvYXBwbGUtdW52ZWlscy1uZXctbWFjLXN0dWRpby1hbmQtYnJpbmdzLWFwcGxlLXNpbGljb24tdG8tbWFjLXByby8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjM5MTExODg4LWEwMWUtNGJjYS1iYTE1LTAzYmRiODlhODc5YyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAUXiGrXv6wS9zzPeXZzIlSTs2NDhcpdRwRtEKlPU6CSs&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2023%2F06%2Fapple-unveils-new-mac-studio-and-brings-apple-silicon-to-mac-pro%2F">claims</a>, can play back 22 8K ProRes video files or ingest up to 24 4K camera feeds "and encode them to ProRes in real time."</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Additionally, the new Mac Pro will come with seven PCIe expansion slots, eight Thunderbolt 4 ports, support for Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3, two 10Gb ethernet ports, three USB-A ports and two HDMI ports that will be able to output 8k resolution at up to 240Hz. There's a headphone jack too, just for good measure.</p><p>Once again though, the Mac Pro will cost a small fortune: $6,999 to start, while the upper bounds of a fully decked-out Pro remain unknown. That is an unfathomable and likely prohibitive sum for most customers, but considering the prior model was just $1,000 cheaper and nearly everything else on earth seems to cost a lot more since 2019, it could be worse.</p><p>The Mac Pro can be ordered today, and will become available starting on June 13.</p><p><em>Developing...</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apple-refreshes-the-mac-pro-with-its-new-m2-ultra-chip-173145016.html?src=rss

## Apple's iOS 17 adds Live Voicemail, StandBy and a Journal app

<p>Apple has introduced iOS 17, and some of its most important changes revolve around fundamental apps. Incoming calls can now include custom posters for certain contacts, and you'll get Google-style live transcripts for voicemail. Messages, meanwhile, offers easier replies, audio message transcripts, in-line location info and a &quot;check in&quot; that automatically lets people know if you've arrived or are delayed. FaceTime lets you leave Live messages. There's a revamped sticker interface that lets you turn emojis into stickers, add effects and even add stickers to third-party apps.</p><p>Siri is now somewhat smarter. You can just say &quot;Siri&quot; to invoke a command, and the voice assistant will take back-to-back commands without requiring that you say the keyword each time.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Sharing is easier, too. NameDrop lets you share contact details just by bringing your iPhone close to someone else's device. You can share photos that way, too, and leave AirDrop transferring content even when you have to step away. A developer framework will expand access to sharing in other apps, too.</p><p>Even typing is better. New AI modelling improves keyboard autocorrection, and you'll see in-line predictions for what you're writing. If there's an unfamiliar word, iOS 17 will recognize it over time.</p><p>And yes, rumors of a life journaling app are true. The new Journal app lets document how you're feeling, complete with suggestions for writing prompts based on events like trips. Developers can tap into these suggestions.</p><p>You can also turn your iPhone into a makeshift smart display with StandBy. Put your phone on its side and you'll get automatically surfacing info through widgets, such as calendar info, music and sports scores. It even automatically adjusts to nighttime with a face that won't hurt your eyes.</p><p><em>This is a developing story.

<p>Apple unveiled the second-generation Mac Studio at its WWDC 2023 keynote. The pro-tier workstation runs on the new M2 Max or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-announces-m2-ultra-chip-with-double-the-cpu-and-gpu-cores-171204873.html">M2 Ultra</a> chip and starts at $1,999. The new Mac Studio is still akin to a “Mac mini Pro,” positioned as a larger and significantly more powerful version of Apple’s budget desktop. But the updated variant now has the M2 Max’s or M2 Ultra’s extra horsepower to excel even more at demanding tasks like 8K video-editing, 3D modeling or music production.</p><p>Apple says the M2 Max version is up to 50 percent faster than the first-gen Mac Studio and four times faster than the most powerful Intel-based 27-inch iMac. In addition, the company says the M2 Max can render up to 50 percent faster in After Effects, while developers can code up to 25 percent faster in Xcode. It has a 12-core CPU, 38-core GPU and up to 96GB of memory while supporting up to 400 GB/s bandwidth.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="M2 Ultra chip, dramatic marketing photo" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/2df28db0-03c7-11ee-afee-143ce59cc061" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>Meanwhile, the M2 Ultra variant “delivers twice the performance and capabilities” of the M2 Max. The M2 Ultra Mac Studio is “up to three times faster” than the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/m1-ultra-benchmarks-upscaled-video-143024262.html">M1 Ultra variant</a> from 2022, and it can run up to six times faster than the highest-end 27-inch Intel iMac. It has a 24-core CPU, up to a 76-core GPU and supports a maximum of 192GB of RAM with 800GB/s unified memory bandwidth.</p><p>The new Mac Studio also has a higher-bandwidth HDMI port, supporting up to 8K resolution and 240Hz frame rates. In practice, Apple says the M2 Ultra version can output its display to up to six Pro Display XDRs while driving over 100 million pixels. The machine also adds WiFi 6E for faster downloads and Bluetooth 5.3.</p><p>On its back, the computer has four Thunderbolt 4 ports, a 10Gb Ethernet port, the upgraded HDMI port and two USB-A ports. Two USB-C ports and an SD card slot are on its front.</p><p>The machine starts at $1,999 for the base M2 Max version.

## Apple announces M2 Ultra chip with double the CPU and GPU cores

<p>We're only two and a half years into Apple's transition to its homegrown CPUs, but things have advanced reasonably quickly. Today the company unveiled the M2 Ultra which is powering the latest refresh to its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-upgraded-mac-studio-includes-the-m2-max-or-m2-ultra-chip-171527954.html">MacStudio</a> and Mac Pro line of desktops. While previous versions of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-m2-chip-power-efficient-180201985.html">M2</a> have been found exclusively in laptops, Apple was able to take brakes off with the Ultra version and claim some serious jumps in performance. It's literally two M2 Max chips stuck together using what Apple calls UltraFusion: A 2.5TB/s  low-latency interprocessor connection. This is very similar to how the M1 Ultra stuck two M1 Maxes in the same package.&nbsp;</p><p>On paper the M2 Ultra is huge leap from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-updates-its-mac-book-pros-with-m-2-pro-and-max-chips-143848558.html">M2 Max</a> found in the MacBook Pro. Core count has doubled from 12 to 24, GPU cores double with up to 76 available on the high-end model, and RAM support jumps from 96 to 192GB with 800GB/s of bandwidth. Granted, almost no one needs that much RAM, but it's nice to know it's an option. Considering the M1 was limited to just 16GB of unified memory when it launched in November of 2020, this is a massive improvement. The Neural Engine is getting a similar boost to 32 cores for AI-based tasks, which should be 40-percent faster than the M2 Max.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Apple made a big point of talking up the media capabilities of their new chips, calling out the ability run 22 8K streams of ProRes footage simultaneously. That sort of power should make short work of almost any video-editing project. The Mac Pro specifically was singled out for having the equivalent power of seven Afterburner cards which the Intel-based Mac Pro relied on for video acceleration.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="Apple M2 Ultra MacPro" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/3ba28300-03c9-11ee-b0f7-461142c9ca86" style="height: 1306px; width: 1306px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>The level of expansion though is what might truly set the M2 Ultra apart from its laptop-focused predecessors. There's WiFi 6e, Bluetooth 5.3 and 10Gb Ethernet built-in (dual 10Gb Ethernet on the Mac Pro), but also room for up to eight Thunderbolt 4 ports on the Mac Pro and six PCIe gen 4 slots. PCI expansion is kind of a necessity for any pro-level desktop, and something that hadn't made its way over to Apple Silicon machines yet. For Apple Silicon to make inroads in the workstation market it was going to have to offer users the ability to add high-end audio cards or 3D accelerators for rendering complex models.&nbsp;</p><p>The launch of the M2 Ultra alongside the refreshed Mac Pro finally completes Apple's years-long transition away from Intel chips to it's own silicon. The company talks a big game about the advantages of its homegrown chips, but it remains to be seen how successful it'll be at infiltrating the highest end of the market.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Apple's WWDC 2023 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/wwdc-2023/"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apple-announces-m2-ultra-chip-with-double-the-cpu-and-gpu-cores-171204873.html?src=rss

## Apple finally announces the 15-inch MacBook Air

<p>Apple's long-rumored 15-inch MacBook Air is finally a reality. As expected, the new laptop is extremely similar to the redesigned 13-inch version that Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-air-m2-hands-on-192857444.html">announced at WWDC one year ago</a> — just a bit bigger. This marks the first time Apple has released a laptop with a screen this size that wasn't part of its &quot;pro&quot; lineup of devices, whether we're talking about the MacBook Pro or its predecessor, the PowerBook.</p><p>As expected, the 15-inch MacBook Air is using the same M2 chip as the smaller model, a processor that was also unveiled about a year ago. Despite its age, we don't have any immediate misgivings about the choice, given how well it performs on the 13-inch MacBook Air.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Design-wise, it’s unsurprisingly similar to all the other laptops Appel has released recently, with a squared-off design rather than the old wedge that the Air was previously known for. It also has the same controversial notch in the display for the 1080p webcam.</p><p>The 15-inch display has a resolution of 3,024 x 1,964, which is the same as the 14.2-inch panel in the MacBook Pro — so it’s a little less pixel dense than that machine. It also doesn’t have the “ProMotion” adaptive refresh rate up to 120Hz; this one tops out at 60Hz. It’s also a standard LCD, not the “XDR” extreme dynamic range display found in the Pro.

## Binance faces SEC charges for allegedly mishandling funds and dodging rules

<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is acting on concerns crypto giant Binance may have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/binance-reportedly-mixed-customer-funds-with-company-revenue-at-a-us-bank-145601679.html">broken the law</a> with its US operations. The regulator <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-101">has filed</a> 13 charges against Binance and founder Changpeng Zhao accusing the two of violating securities laws. Most notably, officials claim Binance knowingly undermined its own international compliance controls to help US investors keep trading on Binance.com when they were only supposed to rely on the separate Binance.US system. Zhao and his company also controlled Binance.US "behind the scenes," the SEC alleges.</p><p>The Commission also maintains that Binance and Zhao mixed and diverted customers' assets at will, including with the Zhao-owned Sigma Chain. The company and its US affiliate are further accused of running unregistered exchanges, broker-dealers and clearing agencies, with Zhao serving as the control. They also allegedly sold unregistered crypto assets, the SEC adds.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The SEC aims to not only force Binance to comply with the law, but to bar Zhao from helming any domestic securities issuers. It also wants the company to disgorge its financial gains from the alleged violations, and to pay additional penalties.</p><p>Binance <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=46b325c0-22ee-4002-8619-163c4534e02a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Binance&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0NmIzMjVjMC0yMmVlLTQwMDItODYxOS0xNjNjNDUzNGUwMmEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmluYW5jZS5jb20vZW4vYmxvZy9lY29zeXN0ZW0vc2VjLWNvbXBsYWludC1haW1zLXRvLXVuaWxhdGVyYWxseS1kZWZpbmUtY3J5cHRvLW1hcmtldC1zdHJ1Y3R1cmUtODcwNzQ4OTExNzEyMjQzNzQwMiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMTVhMmU1NGEtZTQxOS00MjhlLTg2ZjItMzhlODAxNTQzZTVkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAaGEd80bMw0AyzNdvcrHRe0AM8Xyyb20rBR-oFSj2DQZ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.binance.com%2Fen%2Fblog%2Fecosystem%2Fsec-complaint-aims-to-unilaterally-define-crypto-market-structure-8707489117122437402">says</a> it's "disheartened" by the charges and maintains that it has participated in "good-faith" talks to reach a settlement. <em>Reuters</em> investigators reported that Binance commingled $20 million from a corporate account with $15 million for a customer-oriented example. The company denied the allegation, saying that the relevant accounts were only used to "facilitate" cryptocurrency purchases and that the funds were exclusively corporate.</p><p>The SEC allegations come a few months after the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/crypto-giant-binance-charged-with-violating-us-trading-and-derivatives-laws-170817954.html">filed its own charges</a> against Binance and Zhao. It too accused the crypto firm of skirting US regulations and offering unregistered crypto assets.

<p>Apple is slated to hold its annual Worldwide Developer Conference today, and based on the rumors and leaks we've seen, it's shaping up to be a monumental year. The industry is expecting the company to launch its first mixed reality headset, along with a new platform that powers VR or AR applications, as well as the usual suspects like updates to iOS, macOS, watchOS and more. In addition, there might be new Mac hardware and we never know what surprises might be in store. Will there be a <em>Ted Lasso</em> reveal? Or maybe new Fitness+ updates or a celebrity appearance? I guess we'll just have to wait till find out. The show kicks off at 1pm ET/10am PT, and we'll be starting to publish updates at 12pm ET, so stay tuned!</p><div id="7d4e4947ff1745acbddeb5cf69cf3fbd"></div><h2>WWDC 2023 in-depth coverage</h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-wwdc-2023-keynote-watch-it-here-at-1pm-et-150024806.html">Apple WWDC 2023 keynote: Watch it here at 1PM ET</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-wwdc-2023-what-to-expect-from-ios-17-to-new-macbooks-160033810.html">Apple WWDC 2023: What to expect, from iOS 17 to new MacBooks</a></p></li></ul>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apple-wwdc-2023-live-updates-160004876.html?src=rss

<p>It's WWDC time, folks. Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off today with a keynote that's sure to be full of big news. We'll have full coverage of everything you need to know from the event <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-wwdc-2023-what-to-expect-from-ios-17-to-new-macbooks-160033810.html">right here on Engadget</a>, along with immediate reactions to the announcements in our liveblog. You'll also be able to watch the keynote, which starts at 1PM ET, below.</p><p>We're <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-wwdc-2023-what-to-expect-from-ios-17-to-new-macbooks-160033810.html">expecting some major updates</a> from Apple at this year's WWDC. For one thing, rumors suggest the company will <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-mixed-reality-headset-wwdc-2023-announcement-221042779.html">reveal a high-end mixed-reality headset</a>. Apple has been developing the device for many years, according to reports. The headset, said to be called the Reality Pro, is the company's most notable product launch at least since the arrival of the Apple Watch in 2015. However, at an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-reportedly-working-cheaper-mixed-reality-headset-063000889.html">expected price of $3,000</a>, the first version of the headset could be one primarily for early adopters.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Elsewhere, we'll surely hear updates on Apple's operating systems. There could be an enormous change to the iPhone and iPad ecosystem in store if <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-third-party-app-stores-report-195840839.html">rumors hold true</a> and Apple officially supports third-party app stores in iOS 17 and iPadOS 17. We may well learn about several new Macs at the event too, such as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-15-inch-macbook-air-12-inch-revival-170337389.html">a 15-inch MacBook Air</a>. In any case, we won't have to wait long to find out what Apple has in store.</p><div id="63177140471940428a2b25ceeacf1ebc"></div><p><em>Follow all of the news from Apple's WWDC 2023 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/wwdc-2023/"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apple-wwdc-2023-keynote-watch-it-here-at-1pm-et-150024806.html?src=rss

## Reddit communities are 'going dark' to protest changes that would hurt third-party apps

<p>Reddit's potential <a href="https://www.engadget.com/reddit-app-developer-says-the-sites-new-api-rules-will-cost-him-20-million-a-year-203911487.html">threat to third-party apps</a> is prompting a high-profile protest. Dozens of subreddits, including major examples like Earthporn, LifeProTips, ReactionGIFs and Videos, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh0jf/dont_let_reddit_kill_3rd_party_apps/">have declared</a> they're &quot;going dark&quot; (that is,  going private) starting June 12th in response to an API pricing increase they believe will shut out third-party clients. Some will resume public access after 48 hours, but others will &quot;permanently&quot; isolate themselves until Reddit addresses their concerns.</p><p>The protesters are also calling on users to message Reddit administrators, leave negative app reviews and boycott the social site. At the same time, they want participants to be &quot;restrained, polite, reasonable and law-abiding&quot; — threats and other rude behavior won't win people over, according to the organizers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We've asked Reddit for comment. Christian Selig, the creator of popular client Apollo, says the API pricing would cost him $20 million per year. The developers of other apps, such as Narwhal and Reddit is Fun, have also warned that they can't afford the new prices and will likely shut down soon as a result. In the past, Reddit maintained that its pricing is &quot;as equitable as possible&quot; and that it was working to improve the efficiency of apps and reduce their costs.</p><p>As <em>The Verge</em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/5/23749188/reddit-subreddit-private-protest-api-changes-apollo-charges">explains</a>, moderators are as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7/an_open_letter_on_the_state_of_affairs_regarding/">worried</a> about the price change as users. Third-party Reddit apps frequently include customizations and other features that don't make their way into the official app, including moderator tools that help keep subreddits in check. Developers also fear the new API structure would prevent displaying not-safe-for-work content and limit ads that are key to making revenue.</p><p>This isn't the first time Reddit communities have fenced themselves off in protest. In 2015, the IAmA subreddit <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/07/03/419756207/parts-of-social-sharing-site-reddit-go-dark-in-apparent-user-revolt">went private</a> in objection to the sudden firing of communications director Victoria Taylor. In 2021, dozens of subreddits made a similar move to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/reddit-bans-covid-19-misinformation-communities-211159271.html">draw attention to COVID-19 misinformation</a> that was allowed to spread on the platform. Reddit's responses have been mixed. It banned one community and quarantined 54 others after the misinformation protest, but those actions were for abuse rather than the disputed content.</p><p>Reddit's decision comes a few months after Twitter <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-new-developer-terms-ban-third-party-clients-211247096.html">banned third-party apps</a> and severely <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-restores-free-api-access-for-emergency-weather-and-transportation-alerts-204519574.html">limited free API access</a>. In both cases, the strategies effectively force users to rely on official apps, where companies can control more of the experience and generate more money from ads and (in Twitter's case) subscriptions. The fear, as you might guess, is that this leads to a stagnant platform where outsiders can't improve on the core formula.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/reddit-communities-are-going-dark-to-protest-changes-that-would-hurt-third-party-apps-154133342.html?src=rss

## Spotify is laying off 200 employees from its podcast division

<p>Spotify isn't done with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-will-lay-off-6-percent-of-employees-130337498.html">layoffs this year</a>. The company is <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-06-05/an-update-on-changes-to-spotifys-podcast-business-june-2023/">cutting</a> 200 jobs in its podcast division, or about 2 percent of its workforce, as part of a &quot;strategic realignment.&quot; Spotify is moving to a more &quot;tailored approach&quot; that optimizes resources for each podcast creator and their shows, and the streaming service believes this requires a leaner team.</p><p>The new strategy will also see Spotify merge its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-is-dropping-the-paywall-for-some-gimlet-podcasts-162547473.html">Gimlet</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-26-spotify-original-podcasts-parcast.html">Parcast</a> production houses into an updated Spotify Studios unit. They'll continue to produce well-known originals and start new shows, although there will be a new emphasis on frequent content that fosters large audiences. Spotify as a whole will work on &quot;maximizing consumption&quot; from the existing audience, encouraging them to listen more often and to more podcasts. The firm is also growing its Spotify For Podcasters analytics, refining its ad options and adding &quot;more business models&quot; to help creators profit.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The provider is keen to tout its growth since it started investing heavily in podcasts in 2019, including the acquisitions of Gimlet, Parcast and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-23-spotify-year-in-podcasts-2019.html">creator platform Anchor</a>. It now claims to be the most popular podcast platform in &quot;most corners&quot; of the planet, with over 100 million listeners and 5 million shows. Usage has grown over 1,400 percent, Spotify says. It also says it's the top publisher in the US.&nbsp;</p><p>Even so, the layoffs add to a string of blows for the company. Spotify reportedly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-cancels-some-original-podcasts-134405125.html">dropped numerous shows</a> last fall, shedding nearly 5 percent of its podcast team in the process. The service also laid off 6 percent of its total staff in January, with chief content officer Dawn Ostroff (credited with growing podcast content 40-fold) stepping down at the same time. There have also been difficulties with the content itself, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-joe-rogan-deal-value-podcast-205637664.html">misinformation concerns</a> with Spotify exclusive <em>The Joe Rogan Experience</em>. The company may be a powerhouse in the category, but it's no longer as secure as it once was.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/spotify-is-laying-off-200-employees-from-its-podcast-division-134749721.html?src=rss

<p>We’ve finally fully emerged from winter and dad might be feeling a little cooped up. (I know I am, at least.) Now that the days are getting longer, they’re probably itching to get outside ASAP. If your dad or father figure is the type to wander off into the woods — perhaps for days at a time — we’ve got some suggestions for Father’s Day gifts.

It’s only one ounce heavier, but the MiniMo’s wider, shorter cook cup is easier to handle. Plus it can actually simmer things, unlike the Flash. And let me tell you, dehydrated eggs are bad enough as is, even without burning them in what amounts to a coffee tumbler mounted on a jet engine.

There are plenty of options out there when it comes to multitools, and many of them are great. But, the Free series was a serious game-changer with its one-handed access to every tool. Plus everything, including the knife, locks into place so you’re less likely to pinch or cut yourself. It even requires less regular maintenance and cleaning than older Leatherman like the Juice series which, while great, tended to collect lint and dust in every nook and cranny at an alarming rate. Your dad might not need every tool while hiking the Appalachian, but he’ll appreciate having options other than a knife or a rock.</p><h2>Biolite Headlamp 425</h2><p></p><p>After food, water and shelter, the next most essential thing on the trail is light.

It’s <em>ever</em> so slightly bigger and heavier, at 10 millimeters thick and 79 grams, but it also lasts significantly longer. You get up to 60 hours of illumination on low and four hours on high. That’s up from just 40 hours on low and 3.5 hours on high with the Headlamp 330. The 425 is also quite a bit brighter – hitting 425 lumens as the name suggests.</p><p>The rear battery pack now has a red light on it, with both solid and strobe modes, so that your father’s hiking companions can easily spot him if it starts to get dark. And Biolite has finally ditched MicroUSB for USB-C. All the same basic features and modes are still here that you’d expect on any decent headlamp too, including spot, flood and strobe modes, plus eye-sight-saving red light.</p><h2>Sea to Summit X-Mug</h2><p></p><p>I love my old-school enameled steel camp mug.

It’s not the lightest or the warmest, but it’s probably the most versatile. The R-value (a measurement of insulating power) of 4.2 is good enough for three-season camping. And it packs down to about the size of a water bottle. This particular model has been around for a long time, and it will probably continue to be a staple of Therm-a-Rest’s lineup for years to come.</p><h2>Garmin Enduro</h2><p></p><p>Full disclosure: I haven’t tested the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9HYXJtaW4tVWx0cmFwZXJmb3JtYW5jZS1NdWx0aXNwb3J0LUNoYXJnaW5nLVVsdHJhRml0L2RwL0IwOEZTTDk3TlQvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTExZi0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDQyMTY4YzEtNjYwMC00ZGQwLWE2NDktYjI2ODczMTE3NzZlIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAS9L32y8eJnDXC1tf0Cx8Jt0JJD-i0jt07OZlDiJXDCR&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGarmin-Ultraperformance-Multisport-Charging-UltraFit%2Fdp%2FB08FSL97NT%2F">Enduro</a>. Nor has anyone else at Engadget. But, we’re big enough fans of Garmin’s sports watches to feel comfortable recommending it. But why pick this particular one? Simple: battery life. Garmin says it lasts up to 80 hours in GPS mode, which is frankly absurd. If your dad likes to quantify everything in his life, including multi-day hikes, this is a pretty great way to do it. It not only has a giant battery, but also a built-in solar charger. Plus VO2 max estimates for trail runners, heat and altitude acclimation tools for the parent that’s into mountain climbing or desert hiking, and even navigation features to keep him from getting lost. And, once he’s found his way back to civilization he can snag a coffee at Starbucks using Garmin Pay.</p><h2>Sawyer Squeeze water filter</h2><p></p><p>More than even food or shelter, water is essential on the trail. But, dad can’t just go drinking from streams and ponds, nor can he carry enough with him for a multi-day trip. That’s where the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TYXd5ZXItUHJvZHVjdHMtU1AxMjktRmlsdHJhdGlvbi1TcXVlZXphYmxlL2RwL0IwMEIxT1NVNFc_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMTFmLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkNDIxNjhjMS02NjAwLTRkZDAtYTY0OS1iMjY4NzMxMTc3NmUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAASlfjvjplGvcEN8Rnrf08HMqPRWOfdUAildIToIJOH-a&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSawyer-Products-SP129-Filtration-Squeezable%2Fdp%2FB00B1OSU4W%3F">Sawyer Squeeze filter</a> comes in handy. There are tons of different ways to purify water, from old-school iodine tablets to boiling to pump filters. But a squeeze filter system is often the fastest and easiest to use. Sawyer’s are probably the best known for good reason — you can fill up the pouch and drink straight from the filter or use the to fill up a reservoir or water bottle. They’re not ideal for places where dad might be reduced to getting water out of shallow muddy springs or where viral pathogens are a concern. But they’re perfect for more developed and regularly trafficked trails.</p><h2>Ultralite PackTowel</h2><p></p><p>Your dad will need a towel on the trail. Trust me. Maybe he’ll be lucky enough to find a shower. Or perhaps he’ll go for a dip in a lake. Or, maybe like me, he just sweats enough to drown a small animal.

They’re incredibly small and lightweight, yet seem to have unlimited absorption power. I’m pretty sure they’re actually a portal to another dimension where the water is stored. I have two that I take with me on every trip: one body-sized and the other a face towel that stays clipped to my shoulder strap for when I need to mop my brow.</p><h2>Snow Peak Titanium Spork</h2><p></p><p>This should go without saying, but your dad needs a utensil to eat.

Plus, it comes in a handful of  fun shades like blue, green and purple in case your dad is known for his colorful personality.</p><h2>Aeropress Go</h2><p></p><p>If your dad would prefer to burn his lips on <em>real</em> coffee, consider getting him an Aeropress for his adventures. This is, admittedly, a luxury when you’re backpacking. But, I’ve tried instant coffee, coffee “tea” bags, mesh coffee steeping contraptions, camping french presses and honestly, nothing makes better coffee with less cleanup than an Aeropress. You could go for the full-size model, but the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BZXJvUHJlc3MtUG9ydGFibGUtVHJhdmVsLUNvZmZlZS1QcmVzcy9kcC9CMDdZVkw4U0YzP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTExZi0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDQyMTY4YzEtNjYwMC00ZGQwLWE2NDktYjI2ODczMTE3NzZlIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAcuQzztJ3aRBUKkoYqzKULLK4btzc0Z6yFh1AqCgM4Gm&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAeroPress-Portable-Travel-Coffee-Press%2Fdp%2FB07YVL8SF3%3F">Go version</a> shaves off a few precious ounces, which could be crucial when trying to cut weight for a long trip.

It is, first and foremost, an LED lantern perfect for food prep, reading or even playing cards around camp. But, he can also use its 5200mAh battery to charge his phone or headlamp. And, if he does happen to sap all its juice it has a hand crank for recharging through manual labor, and an optional solar panel.</p><h2>Joby GripTight Action Kit</h2><p></p><p>Obviously, part of the reason dad disappears into the wilderness is to escape from technology and enjoy nature.

It can be a dutch oven, a griddle or a skillet. You can even bake a pizza inside it. ( I’ll admit, though, that I’ve never considered baking a pizza while camping.) Cast iron is heavy and bulky, but it’s also damn near indestructible and holds on to heat for a long time, which is good when you’re dealing with a finicky campfire. Plus, if seasoned properly and treated with care, cast iron is reasonably nonstick. So, dad might even be able to make some sunny-side-up eggs for breakfast.</p><h2>Helinox Chair Zero</h2><p></p><p>Had you asked me ten years ago, I’d have said there’s no way I would drag a chair backpacking with me.

The Chair Zero fits in a stuff sack just 13.8 x 3.9 x 3.9 inches, while the L is a little larger at 14 x 4.5 x 4 inches. The difference between the two is that the L is wider and taller and can support up to 320 pounds for big and tall types.</p><h2>Gear Aid Medium-Duty 325 Paracord</h2><p></p><p><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=a469010c-daf8-4253-9f11-de62acc66c5a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=REI&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJhNDY5MDEwYy1kYWY4LTQyNTMtOWYxMS1kZTYyYWNjNjZjNWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVpLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0LzE0OTk4NS9nZWFyLWFpZC0zMjUtcGFyYWNvcmQtNTAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImQ0MjE2OGMxLTY2MDAtNGRkMC1hNjQ5LWIyNjg3MzExNzc2ZSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAW4N7KE29UU3ysIhWL0I1sBbbIQC7MjvT4ZT1zRuhO_L&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F149985%2Fgear-aid-325-paracord-50">Paracord</a> is one of the most useful things dad can bring on any camping trip, whether it’s from the comfort of a car or thru hiking the Appalachian. The medium-duty stuff is good enough for tying down tents, hanging food bags or replacing boot laces. It can even be split open and the inner threads used as a fishing line, but hopefully your father never finds themselves in a situation that desperate. This isn’t a flashy gift, but it might get more use than anything else on this list.</p><h2>Tribit StormBox Micro 2</h2><p></p><p>One of our favorite <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-portable-bluetooth-speakers-133004551.html">portable Bluetooth speakers</a> makes an excellent camping companion.

And its IP67 rating means it should be able to take a solid beating without giving up the ghost. Add to that a strap that makes it easy to clip to a backpack or just hang from a nail in a lean-to and the ability to act as a battery bank in case you need to top up your phone in an emergency, and this is a versatile little speaker for dad to keep in their hiking bag. The sound isn’t going to blow anyone away, but it’s good enough, especially at just $60.</p><h2>Backpacks</h2><figure><img alt="Osprey Aura 65 backpack" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-05/78013a30-dd19-11ec-bee9-5d0c81ebb7b9" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Last year we recommended <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=7dea0e5f-14f6-45ce-9918-be9ac9881907&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Osprey&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI3ZGVhMGU1Zi0xNGY2LTQ1Y2UtOTkxOC1iZTlhYzk4ODE5MDciLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub3NwcmV5LmNvbS91cy9lbi9wcm9kdWN0L2F0bW9zLWFnLTY1LUFUTU9TNjVTMjJfMzY5Lmh0bWw_IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkNDIxNjhjMS02NjAwLTRkZDAtYTY0OS1iMjY4NzMxMTc3NmUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVYFDNCc2jqSD5ucGrjNHd16jCN-1kIzDd-COmstoFRz&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.osprey.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fproduct%2Fatmos-ag-65-ATMOS65S22_369.html%3F">Osprey’s Atmos AG 65</a> for anyone looking to be as comfortable as possible while backpacking. This year, we’re doing the same, just with some updated Osprey designs. The Atmos has been given a minor face lift, but the bigger deal is that it’s now made with 100-percent recycled materials. You still get an integrated rain cover, Anti-Gravity suspension and fit-on-the-fly adjustment system. It’s just now more eco friendly.</p><p>As part of the redesign, the capacity has been increased to better reflect the pack’s name. Before, if you bought the Atmos 65 in a small, you actually only got 62 liters of storage. Now the small is a full 65 liters. The one downside is that the new materials and carrying capacity have led to a slight increase in weight too, with the S/M Atmos AG 65 coming in at four pounds, 10 ounces.</p><p>The women’s equivalent of the Atmos is the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=7dea0e5f-14f6-45ce-9918-be9ac9881907&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Osprey&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI3ZGVhMGU1Zi0xNGY2LTQ1Y2UtOTkxOC1iZTlhYzk4ODE5MDciLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub3NwcmV5LmNvbS91cy9lbi9wcm9kdWN0L2F1cmEtYWctNjUtQVVSQTY1UzIyXzQxNi5odG1sPyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDQyMTY4YzEtNjYwMC00ZGQwLWE2NDktYjI2ODczMTE3NzZlIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAdHKGwQmcCiUtD5YClxdce7ipaKB6ahMbDjDmX3d2yTm&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.osprey.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fproduct%2Faura-ag-65-AURA65S22_416.html%3F">Aura AG 65</a>, which is slightly smaller and lighter, but has the same suspension system and similar lugging capacity. And if you’re on a tight budget this year, you can still find the older model available in some places at a steep discount.</p><h2>Tents</h2><figure><img alt="Coleman Skydome 6" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-05/97c73ae0-dd19-11ec-98f5-f16da87c238d" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Coleman</div></figure><p>Obviously, one of the most important pieces of camping equipment is a tent. Not everyone’s dad wants to spend their nights in a lean-to. But their needs will dictate what kind of tent to buy. If your giftee is an avid backpacker who needs something ultra light to take on the trail, I heartily recommend Big Agnes’ Tiger Wall UL 2. It’s not their lightest offering, but it strikes a great balance between weight and convenience. It can sleep two, and has two vestibules for stowing gear, but as a single person tent it’s borderline luxurious. Even with the optional <a href="https://www.bigagnes.com/Tiger-Wall-UL2-Footprint-2021">footprint</a> (which I highly recommend for <em>any</em> tent), the pack weight weighs under three pounds, and the mtnGLO light system means no fussing with a lantern or headlamp to read and sort gear after dark.</p><p>If unabashed luxury is more your dad’s thing, consider <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=a469010c-daf8-4253-9f11-de62acc66c5a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=REI&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJhNDY5MDEwYy1kYWY4LTQyNTMtOWYxMS1kZTYyYWNjNjZjNWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVpLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0LzIwMjk4Mi9yZWktY28tb3Atd29uZGVybGFuZC02LXRlbnQiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImQ0MjE2OGMxLTY2MDAtNGRkMC1hNjQ5LWIyNjg3MzExNzc2ZSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAUk3QGdOpMh_-yBQkU0CJ09pSl3eCRKOO0Y67TEesZSh&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F202982%2Frei-co-op-wonderland-6-tent">REI’s Wonderland 6</a>. At $599, this is no casual investment, but it should last quite some time. The walls are nearly vertical and it reaches a height of six and a half feet in the middle, meaning all but the tallest of humans should be able to stand upright inside. The 83-square feet of floor space is plenty of room for a family of six to sleep in, and it has large ventilation windows to keep the inside cool during the hottest months. The one caveat is that, if you happen to do most of your camping in rainy environments, you might want to shop around for something with fewer windows and better rainfly coverage.</p><p>Neither the Wonderland, nor the Tiger Wall are cheap. So if budget is an important factor, or if dad is just looking to dabble in the world of car camping, consider the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3719d8d4-5edd-4817-998a-91f3229e7323&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Walmart&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzNzE5ZDhkNC01ZWRkLTQ4MTctOTk4YS05MWYzMjI5ZTczMjMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FsbWFydC5jb20vaXAvQ29sZW1hbi02LVBlcnNvbi1Ta3lkb21lLUNhbXBpbmctVGVudC1FdmVyZ3JlZW4vNDAzMTMyMDkwPyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDQyMTY4YzEtNjYwMC00ZGQwLWE2NDktYjI2ODczMTE3NzZlIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAQdIPNdoOWENB9mkccMdpYyFY95ll02NYoneWrDPhiDq&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FColeman-6-Person-Skydome-Camping-Tent-Evergreen%2F403132090%3F">Coleman Skydome 6</a>. Coleman gear is nothing fancy. You can find it in practically any Walmart or Dick’s Sporting Goods across the country. But it’s so ubiquitous because of its rock solid reliability and reasonable prices. The Skydome 6 is nearly the same size as the Wonderland, but comes in at just $130 (or $199 if you opt for the Darkroom model). The ceiling is shorter, and the walls more angled, but if you’re only using the tent to sleep in, that shouldn’t be a major concern.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-backpacking-camping-gear-for-dads-131509621.html?src=rss
