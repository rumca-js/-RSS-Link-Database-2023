To celebrate the launch of Diablo 4, here’s a look back at the history of Diablo. 
#diablo #gamespot #diablo4 

We’ve been slaying, looting, and clicking through Diablo’s procedurally generated dungeons for over 25 years. The original Diablo birthed the action-RPG genre, and it continued to hone that formula to become an absolutely giant franchise. 

The 1994 pitch for Diablo is really interesting to go back and read today. The document presented a game that’s pretty similar to what we know of as Diablo now, from the beginning it was always built with replayability in mind, with an emphasis on exploration and experimenting with the game’s different classes. But there were key differences, namely that Diablo was originally planned to be a turn-based game with permadeath, and that it would be expanded by adding items and quests through expansion packs inspired by Magic the Gathering booster packs. 

To celebrate the launch of the latest in the franchise, Diablo 4, Lucy takes a look back at the history of the franchise, from its highs and its auction house lows.

RoboCop: Rogue City Captures The Vibe Of The Original Movie And Benefits From RPG-Inspired Gameplay

In Rogue City, you play as Old Detroit cop Alex Murphy, who, after being fatally wounded, is rebuilt as a cyborg called RoboCop. Armed with enhanced strength and durability, advanced scanning technology, and other cutting-edge tools, you're tasked with bringing lethal justice to the growing criminal element of the city. After a hostage situation leaves you partially damaged, however, you begin to remember your old life and the wife you once had, causing you to accidentally hesitate in a dangerous situation. With your higher-ups wary of your mental state and the general public unsure if you can be trusted, you have to figure out how to proceed forward case-to-case to earn that faith back, all the while shaping the future of Old Detroit.

RoboCop: Rogue City is scheduled to launch for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC in September 2023.
