A new 42-second clip from GameSpot's own video producer Max Blumenthal went viral, depicting an absurd sequence of events.</p><p>The video starts with Blumenthal facing off against a Hinox and several smaller enemies. Then, the player utilizes the Rewind ability to freeze an incoming boulder in mid-air, before Ascending through it. Once at the top of the boulder (that's still in mid-air), Blumenthal then proceeds to shoot all the enemies with arrows from above.</p><div><blockquote align=\"center\" class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Hit 'em from every angle, there's no escape\ud83d\udc7a <a href=\"https://t.co/rDZxvrLp9y\">pic.twitter.com/rDZxvrLp9y</a></p>  \u2014 Max Blumenthal (@RinHara5aki) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RinHara5aki/status/1665724907525914625?ref_src=twsrc^tfw\">June 5, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p>After taking down a few enemies with arrows, the player launches up into the air once again, this time with a rocket. Following a graceful landing, an explosion takes down several more enemies before Blumenthal is back in the air, shooting more arrows at the enemies. From there, the player uses a Boomerang, and then a Zonai device to surf around the area, before taking nearly everyone else down in a swift, fluid motion.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-make-you-feel-bad-about-your-zelda-skills-in-42-seconds/1100-6514827/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-make-you-feel-bad-about-your-zelda-skills-in-42-seconds/1100-6514827/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-06-05 21:23:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Microsoft Office And Windows 11 Pro Bundle Is $60 Right Now", "description": "<p>StackCommerce has a bundle deal on a lifetime license for Microsoft Office Pro 2021 and Windows 11 Pro for just $60 (valued at $419).

One of the core deck archetypes in Marvel Snap has long been starved for new tools, forcing it to languish near the bottom and mid-tier ranks. That could all be changing with the next season, a loose tie-in with Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse called (what else) <strong>Spider-Versus</strong>. As a match for the wallcrawler's legendary agility, this next season looks squarely focused on movement-based abilities, and that could shake up the meta in ways we haven't seen since the game launched.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Move decks are some of the earliest archetypes you gain in Marvel Snap, earning most of the major tools while still at a relatively low rank. They make for a good learning tool--Snap is a zone-control game at its heart, so movement-based abilities help illustrate the core mechanics and give beginning players their first taste of a tricky strategy that can make good use of bluffs. Experienced Move deck players know not just when to play Heimdall as their big finisher, but also when <em>not</em> to, letting their opponent overcommit to a location that isn't really being contested.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">All that said, movement-based decks haven't remained viable for high-level play. Perhaps because movement is such an obviously strong ability for a zone-control game, developer Second Dinner has been incredibly scarce with adding new movement-based cards. The very first season pass when it came out of beta was Symbiote Invasion, which introduced Miles Morales. Miles is a decent enough Move staple, with a huge cost reduction if another card has moved. More recently Snap introduced Jeff, an adorable little shark who can move anywhere regardless of effects that restrict movement. He's seen plenty of play, but not in movement-based decks. Instead, Jeff mostly exists as a tech card to counter other popular strategies revolving around Spider-Man and Professor X, who otherwise lock down locations.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-snap-spider-verse-season-could-make-the-worst-deck-into-one-of-the-best/1100-6514825/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-snap-spider-verse-season-could-make-the-worst-deck-into-one-of-the-best/1100-6514825/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-06-05 19:23:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Apple Vision Pro Reactions For The $3,500 Headset Are All Over The Place", "description": "<p>Apple has revealed its next product, the <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apple-finally-reveals-long-awaited-ar-headset-vision-pro/1100-6514811/\">Apple Vision Pro</a>, and its announcement certainly garnered quite a response online.

When talking about rarities, you'll see the following:</p><ul><li>Common (grey)</li><li>Magic (blue)</li><li>Rare (yellow)</li><li>Legendary (orange) - Given the new <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-legendary-aspects-codex-of-power-guide/1100-6514618/\"><strong>Codex of Power/Legendary Aspects mechanics</strong></a>, legendaries are just rare items with a Legendary Aspect (i.e. perk/affix). They're no longer the one-of-a-kind drops that every class searches for.</li><li>Unique (gold) - This is now the highest rarity, which we explain below.</li><li>Note that Sacred and Ancestral items are mostly affixes related to stat rolls, which we detail later in this guide.</li></ul><figure style=\"width: 1280px;\"><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4148212-diablo-4-unique-sacred-legendary-items-1.jpg\"><img alt=\"There's a Legendary Focus drop, which happens to be Sacred as well.\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4148212-diablo-4-unique-sacred-legendary-items-1.jpg\" /></a><figcaption>There's a Legendary Focus drop, which happens to be Sacred as well.</figcaption></figure><h3>Unique Items</h3><p>The Diablo 4 Unique items now occupy the highest tier in terms of rarity.

Having played a few hours of the game at a preview event, I'm a bit conflicted regarding how I feel about the upcoming sci-fi first-person shooter. Rogue City captures the look and sounds and overall feel of the first two RoboCop movies exceptionally well, but by sticking so close to the general vibe of those movies, it creates several moments that aren't very fun to play. It has good voice acting and some intriguing RPG-inspired elements working in its favor, though.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In Rogue City, you play as Old Detroit cop Alex Murphy, who, after being fatally wounded, is rebuilt as a cyborg called RoboCop. Armed with enhanced strength and durability, advanced scanning technology, and other cutting-edge tools, you're tasked with bringing lethal justice to the growing criminal element of the city. After a hostage situation leaves you partially damaged, however, you begin to remember your old life and the wife you once had, causing you to accidentally hesitate in a dangerous situation. With your higher-ups wary of your mental state and the general public unsure if you can be trusted, you have to figure out how to proceed forward case-to-case to earn that faith back, all the while shaping the future of Old Detroit. You can punish every crime with aggressive force, for example, or take the time to resolve things more amicably.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">This game emulates the visuals, sounds, and just the general vibe of the original RoboCop and its 1990 sequel--the two best entries in the franchise--very well. Much like Alien Isolation or Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, Rogue City feels genuine to the storyline of its respective franchise, recapturing the aesthetic and then squeezing a brand-new story into a familiar narrative framework. Rogue City obviously differs from games like Alien Isolation or Fallen Order by not tackling its world from the perspective of a never-before-seen main character. This does mean--at least at first glance from the few hours I played--Rogue City sometimes feels a little too close to the original RoboCop movies. Those movies already explored themes of control and free will through the lens of Alex Murphy, leaving Rogue City feeling like it's retreading old ground. It's too soon to make a definitive call on the full storyline, but I am worried that the efforts to keep Rogue City faithful to the vision of the original movies may result in the story ultimately feeling \"been there, done that.\"</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/robocop-rogue-city-captures-the-vibe-of-the-movies-and-benefits-from-rpg-inspired-gameplay/1100-6514775/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/robocop-rogue-city-captures-the-vibe-of-the-movies-and-benefits-from-rpg-inspired-gameplay/1100-6514775/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-06-05 14:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "E3 Killed E3, Says Summer Game Fest's Geoff Keighley", "description": "<p>In a recent <a href=\"https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/podcast-geoff-keighley-talks-summer-game-fest/\">VGC Podcast interview</a>, Summer Game Fest host/producer Geoff Keighley hit back against claims that SGF is responsible for the death of E3--the Entertainment Software Association's seemingly defunct (but once very popular) annual gaming expo.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\"I think E3 sort of killed itself in a way,\" Keighley said when asked about his show's reputation as the source of <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-is-canceled/1100-6512853/\">E3's downfall</a>. \"I understand why people say [I killed E3], but I think if anything, we created Summer Game Fest, and I built Summer Game Fest because I saw the wheels falling off the wagon of E3.\"</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/summer-game-fest-event-announced-by-former-e3-live/1100-6476731/\">Keighley created Summer Game Fest in 2020</a>, after the COVID-19 pandemic led to <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2020-is-officially-canceled-due-to-coronavirus-/1100-6474647/\">E3 2020's cancellation</a>.

It's one which relies on a lack of combat, putting players in horrifying situations they can't win, and demanding they run and hide instead. Through countless imitators and even a few sequels, Frictional Games has had its formula repeated, but <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/amnesia-the-bunker/\">Amnesia: The Bunker</a> is not the latest in that lineage. It plays quite differently, though it still feels like a classic Amnesia game in vital ways, and it's this combination of old and new that helps make it the studio's scariest game since The Dark Descent.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Amnesia: The Bunker is, in some ways, the Amnesia you may know already. You'll play in first-person as a character who is suffering from memory loss and must piece together their own history, as well as that of the unnerving locale in which they inevitably find themselves. In The Bunker, that character is Henri Clement, a French soldier during World War I who loses consciousness while rescuing a fellow soldier from harm's way, then awakens in the titular bunker seemingly all alone--though he will soon wish that were truly the case.</p><figure style=\"width: 1920px;\"><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4146653-2.png\"><img alt=\"Out of the frying pan...\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4146653-2.png\" /></a><figcaption>Out of the frying pan...</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\">Through scattered notes, the story of the labyrinthine bunker will come into focus. It's an entertaining, albeit detail-light, saga that seems to tie directly to other games in deep-cut ways that some players will appreciate. But it's just as easy to play it and not have any context for the story at all, or take it as a standalone horror story about a man trapped in a maze with a monster. It works well enough in each case, but it does feel like there's less narrative to unpack than past games in the series.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/amnesia-the-bunker-review-shellshocked/1900-6418075/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/amnesia-the-bunker-review-shellshocked/1900-6418075/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-06-05 13:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
