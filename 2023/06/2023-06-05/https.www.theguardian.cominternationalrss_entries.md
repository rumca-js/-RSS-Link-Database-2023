<p>Efforts to stop upgrade of BR-319 are faltering amid pressure from rightwing governors and senators</p><p>When a new road pierces the Amazon rainforest, it creates what is known as the fishbone effect. First comes the spine, which is a highway opened up by bulldozers, asphalters and pavers. Soon after follow the ribs, the spur roads on either side that are carved out – often illegally – by land-grabbers, loggers, miners and farmers. From a satellite or plane, the end result resembles the skeleton of a herring with all of the surrounding vegetation steadily filleted away by chainsaws and fire.</p><p>Since the opening of the Trans-Amazonian highway in 1972, such fishbones have appeared throughout the world’s greatest rainforest with devastating effect. Ninety-five per cent of all deforestation in the Amazon occurs within 5.5km (3.4 miles) of a road.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/05/amazon-road-ruin-highway-threatens-heart-rainforest">Continue reading...</a>

Toulouse impressed by winning the Coupe de France and staying up comfortably, as did the often swashbuckling Lorient and Montpellier.

But for keen observers of Ligue 1, perhaps the biggest surprise came at the Parc des Princes on Saturday, when Clermont Foot 63 defeated the champions.</p><p>Whereas Lens and Reims benefited from strong investment (by Ligue 1 standards), Toulouse had plenty of continuity in their playing staff, and Montpellier’s happy reunion with Michel der Zakarian was unsurprising given he had nearly taken the club to Europe in recent seasons, Clermont had none of this – just a canny, veteran manager in Pascal Gastien.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/05/clermont-win-psg-caps-brilliant-season-pascal-gastien-parc-des-princes">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Jane Gull’s offers strange tonal shifts and an oddly dreamy treatment of the brutal situation the central couple find themselves in</p><p>British writer-director Jane Gull made a strong impression with her very likable 2016 debut <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/03/my-feral-heart-review-a-thoughtful-portrait-of-disability">My Feral Heart</a>, about a young carer with Down’s syndrome. This follow-up feature is about a young couple faced with homelessness. Paul (Niall McNamee) is a young Irish guy hoping to make it as a singer-songwriter and playing pubs in London; his manager is his wife, Sophie, played by EastEnders’s Shana Swash. When they are booted out of their flat for non-payment of the exploitatively high rent, the couple head to Southend looking for work, and gigs and things go from bad to worse.</p><p>This is a well-intentioned, earnestly acted film, but the tonal shifts are frankly uncomfortable. The brutally grim events in Paul and Sophie’s life are repeatedly leavened with an odd sort of John-Carney-does-poverty dreaminess. And then, looking for casual building-trade work, Paul is effectively kidnapped by gangmasters, kept as slave labour with illegals on building sites and forced to participate in what appear to be tramp fights; he is made to square up to some other poor wretch surrounded by a circle of shaven-headed extras with fists full of cash baying for blood.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/05/love-without-walls-review-musicians-end-up-homeless-in-well-intentioned-drama">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This new collection of 70s journalism exposes a sexist and wrongheaded essayist with an unwarranted reputation</p><p>In her introduction to this pocket-sized new collection of journalism by the American writer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/susan-sontag">Susan Sontag</a>, the academic <a href="https://www.merveemre.com/">Merve Emre</a> begins with a reassurance to (younger, I assume) readers that there’s nothing to be afraid of here. “A certain anxiety besieges the critic asked to introduce a volume of earlier writings on women, lest she should find the ideas expressed in them interesting only as relics of a distant, less enlightened past,” she declares, eyeing the smelling salts she presumably keeps about her desk for times just like these. But don’t worry. She has checked and there is no ghastly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-wave_feminism">second-wave feminism</a> to be found in these pages: “Far from prompting the gentle rebuke that they are ‘of their time’, the effect of reading them today is to marvel at the untimeliness of their genius.”</p><p>To read such a statement in isolation is infuriating enough, and not only because you grow increasingly weary of the conviction that the past must always be measured against our own, supposedly morally superior, times. I can think of lots of “earlier” feminist writing that is as good, if not better, than anything published more recently; if young feminists can’t, or won’t, acknowledge the debt we owe to those who came before us, they may be fighting the wrong cause. But then you read the essays that follow Emre’s, in which Sontag makes some of the most sexist and wrongheaded assertions I’ve read in a long time, and exasperation turns to bewilderment. What’s really going on here? What book did <em>she</em> read? When, you wonder, will the unwarranted allure Sontag holds for a certain kind of intellectual ever begin to fray?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/05/on-women-by-susan-sontag-review-some-sister-she-was">Continue reading...</a>
