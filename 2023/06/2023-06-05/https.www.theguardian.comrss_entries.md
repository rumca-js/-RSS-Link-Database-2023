<p>Starring a bizarrely blank Lily-Rose Depp, this big, dumb drama from the maker of Euphoria is desperate to be edgy – but ends up feeling boring and, well, unsexy</p><p>Fittingly, for a show so concerned with its own ideas about artifice and superficiality, the first 20 minutes of The Idol give the impression of a drama that is much better, more robust and more interesting than it goes on to become. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/03/is-euphoria-the-most-shocking-teen-show-ever">Euphoria creator Sam Levinson</a> writes and directs this cartoonishly sleazy tale of a pop star’s gilded life and the guru who sweeps in to shake it and her up. The Idol is already so drenched in noise – is it exploitative? too outrageous? – that it is simply leaning in to the controversy; the streaming platform I watch it on is advertising it as a “headline-making drama”.</p><p>That’s one way of spinning the more negative reports that have emerged about the show’s production, but it also provides a heads-up that the programme is going to try hard to be shocking. For its more successful opening scenes, it does this with humour. Pop star Jocelyn (Lily-Rose Depp, looking blank, though this is surely deliberate) is shooting the cover for her new album, then rehearsing with dancers in the garden of her mansion as a PR crisis explodes in the background: she becomes the top trending topic on Twitter because someone leaks a photograph of her with semen on her face. Her live agent is furious and worries that 14-year-old girls will no longer buy tickets to watch her performing a song called I’m a Freak, the lyrics of which include the lines, “Get down on your knees and get ready to become my bitch.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/05/the-idol-review-light-bondage-and-lots-of-sleaze-make-for-the-ultimate-try-hard-tv">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The actor’s 97-year-old grandfather may be a master of understatement – but he’s also one of the few people left who can recall the ‘hell let loose’ of the D-day landings. His story makes for staggering TV</p><p>I don’t mind admitting that I had a tear in my eye long before the end of Vicky McClure: My Grandad’s War. This moving documentary puts the Line of Duty and This Is England actor into the role of historian, presenter and interviewer as she tells the story of her grandfather, Ralph McClure, who was a ship’s signaller in the Royal Navy on D-day in 1944. It shares a few camera angles with Who Do You Think You Are? but it goes one better, as Ralph is now 97 and on hand to tell his granddaughter, and us, his own story.</p><p>The pair live around the corner from each other in Nottingham, and are clearly close. But as McClure points out, while she knew he was in the Navy, she really knows nothing about his experience of war. Ralph must be one of the last survivors still able to tell his story, and getting McClure to ask him about it gives it an intimate feel that seems just as revealing, if not more so, than the history we get from the textbooks.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/05/vicky-mcclure-my-grandads-war-review-a-beautiful-tale-of-bravery-that-will-make-you-weep">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A trip to the High Court to obtain a temporary injunction could become an annual feature after Animal Rising’s actions</p><p>Relief and pride at a job well done were, according to Nevin Truesdale, the Jockey Club’s chief executive, the primary emotions at Epsom on Saturday evening after the 2023 Derby joined the previous 243 in the form book. “It is incredibly important that this race continues to take place,” Truesdale told Racing TV’s Luck On Sunday programme, “and that we’re not disrupted by illegal activity.”</p><p>There are, of course, other positives for the track and its owners to take from the 2023 Derby beyond the simple fact that it happened and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/03/aidan-obrien-works-his-magic-with-auguste-rodin-to-win-the-derby-horse-racing">Auguste Rodin took his place</a> on the sport’s most illustrious roll of honour.

Well, since several high-profile members – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/apr/21/cbi-suspend-operations-top-uk-businesses-john-lewis-natwest">the likes of NatWest, the John Lewis Partnership and Aviva</a> – have resigned, there is a slightly self-selecting flavour to the electorate. It has also been noticeable in the days since the CBI published its “prospectus for change” last week that corporate waverers – companies that “paused” or suspended membership – have not been publicly clamouring to get back into the fold. Maybe some are waiting for the meeting to make a splash or have returned without fanfare. But it’s odd that the top letter-writers to the Times in defence of a 58-year-old British business organisation have been the UK subsidiaries of three foreign firms: Siemens of Germany and Microsoft and ExxonMobil of the US.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/jun/05/vote-cbi-future-unlikely-to-be-end-of-story-bcc-business-council">Continue reading...</a>

<p>One year after Bruno Pereira and Dom Phillips were killed in the Amazon, their work explaining what is happening there goes on</p><p>The decision by Brazilian police <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/05/brazil-police-charge-alleged-mastermind-behind-murders-of-dom-phillips-and-bruno-pereira" title="">to charge two more men</a> with the murders of Bruno Pereira and Dom Phillips, in the Javari valley region of the Amazon, brings the possibility of justice one step closer. To the three fishers already in custody for the shootings, which took place one year ago, have been added the alleged leader of a transnational illegal fishing network, Ruben Dario da Silva Villar, nicknamed Colombia (where he also has citizenship). A fourth fisher, Jânio Freitas de Souza, is alleged to have been one of Silva Villar’s henchmen on the Itaquaí river, where the killings took place.</p><p>For friends and supporters of the two men’s work defending the Amazon and its Indigenous inhabitants, the investigation’s progress offers some relief.

It’s far too late in the day for miracles. But the Tories had been expecting something a little better than what they’ve been given. To put it bluntly, Rishi Sunak is a disappointment. If he was a morning TV chatshow host he would have long since been sent out by his bosses to apologise for being alive. Though, given his current performance levels, he would probably have found a way to cock that up as well.</p><p>We had been led to believe that Rish! was a break with the past. A different type of prime minister than Boris Johnson and Liz Truss. Someone with little charisma – the Conservatives had had more than enough of personalities – but who could be trusted to have a basic level of competence. Would get up in the morning and dress himself successfully. Might even have read the contents of his red box rather than wing it.

Such is their state of delusion that these entitled so-and-sos want somebody with iron-clad credentials in charge of their club, a serial winner in the mould of … er, José Mourinho or Antonio Conte.

My recent tension levels are at an all-time high, though. The Football League insists on repeatedly docking the club points. This does not stop the club defaulting on wages because, guess what, they haven’t got enough money to pay them. We will now start next season on -8 points (if we start next season at all) and be favourites for relegation to League Two.

<p>Its door handles are made of salt. Its walls are made of sunflowers. Its furniture is made of Japanese knotweed. And it was stained with dyes made with filtered urine. Is this recycling marvel in southern France the future of architecture?</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>In a former railway repair shop in the southern French city of Arles, flasks of lurid green algae are bubbling away on a shelf, in a room that looks like a cross between a modern-day laboratory and a witch’s potion-brewing den. Nearby, a 3D printer spews out curious objects made from algae-based bioplastic, while samples of algae-dyed textiles hang on a rack. Some of the walls appear to be made of rice cakes, others look like Weetabix, while some are daubed with a coat of porridgy gloop. All are natural byproducts of the local sunflower industry, the mashed-up pith and fibres redeployed as acoustic insulation. Elsewhere, there are antibacterial door handles made of salt, harvested from the region’s salt marshes; thermal insulation made from bales of local rice straw; and bathroom tiles made of waste clay from a nearby quarry.</p><p>You’ve heard of farm-to-table food? Well, this is farm-to-building architecture: the latest low-carbon weapon in the battle against the climate crisis. “We call it bioregional design,” says Jan Boelen, artistic director of <a href="https://www.atelier-luma.org/">Atelier Luma</a>. Given that the built environment accounts for around 40% of global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, he argues it is time we embraced locally sourced, organic methods of construction. “We need to move from globalised, extractive supply chains towards regional ecosystems of materials that help regenerate the environment. Where others might see waste, we see opportunities.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/05/ultimate-eco-building-salt-sunflowers-recycled-urine-atelier-luma-architecture">Continue reading...</a>

## Keir Starmer says he wants to empower local communities. The Jamie Driscoll affair suggests otherwise | Simon Jenkins

<p>Blocking the North of Tyne mayor from standing for Labour again shows how deep the party’s centralism runs</p><p>It’s what they do, not what they say. All opposition leaders are localists until it matters. Keir Starmer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/05/keir-starmer-vows-to-let-communities-take-back-control-in-labour-first-term">said</a> in January he wanted to “take back control” for local communities. The Labour leader wants them to have more say over jobs, transport, energy, climate change, housing, culture, childcare and finance. He wants to liberate what is now recognised as the most centralised state in Europe. So why, now, has the Labour leader decided that the people of the North of Tyne area <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/02/labour-block-jamie-driscoll-from-north-east-mayoralty-contest">will not be permitted to reselect</a> their current mayor, Jamie Driscoll, to stand for Labour at the next election? Why did he agree in March that his predecessor as leader, Jeremy Corbyn, should not be reselected as MP for Islington North?</p><p>Whatever the perceived misdeeds of these two politicians, surely these are matters for their respective communities to decide on. Come to that, I notice in the past few weeks that, despite his devolution speech, Starmer wants <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/30/labour-would-freeze-council-tax-for-one-year-says-keir-starmer#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%E2%80%99re%20announcing%20today%20that,it%20to%20help%20working%20people.%E2%80%9D">no devolution</a> of power over council tax rises, local housing decisions or the siting of wind turbines, among other things. Nor will he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/04/labour-plans-to-ban-north-sea-oil-production-naive-says-union-leader">tolerate</a> any nonsense from Scottish people about “taking back control” of Scotland.

<p>The intolerable pressure leads to terrible family rows. I thought I had escaped the worst of it with my children, but I now realise I was wrong</p><p>In September 2013, I thought I was the most intelligent person ever to exist. By some masterstroke of family planning, I’d managed to have two children, spaced almost two years apart, but because the first was born in September and the second August, they were in adjacent school years. By my calculations, I’d saved two whole years of childcare, which back then was more expensive than the mortgage, but only because at that point Liz Truss was still in charge of childcare costs, and had yet to screw with everyone’s mortgage. And it wasn’t even intentional, my miracle! I was a genius at the level of the ovary.</p><p>Obviously, I hadn’t really thought through what the consequences would be, once they hit the meaningful-exam stage of life, which they still haven’t – at the moment I’m just observing other people. GCSE and A-level events are objectively weird for a household whatever its composition, because for the first time, the kid’s day has the highest stakes. You can pretend this is true for the preceding decade – big day, darling, you’re the narrator in Sinbad the Sailor and yes it <em>is </em>a big deal whether you get the crabs and the dancing squid in the right order – but now it is real. It doesn’t matter what your job is, whole human lives could be hanging off your performance; you still won’t come anywhere near the singular tightrope of the exam, that absolutely atomised space where you’re not allowed to ask for help, you can’t take a little more time, and you’ll be judged on the outcome, indeed that is all you’ll be judged on, until such time as you achieve anything else, which could be never.</p><p>Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/05/exam-season-makes-everyone-unhappy-why-do-we-put-up-with-it">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After trophy-laden Camp Nou stay the midfielder discusses what next, his favourite season and splits in Spain’s victorious 2012 squad</p><p>There was something heist movie about it, the story taking shape one man at a time, like the opening scenes from a film.

It was easy to imagine a plot being hatched, to hear the deep voice of the Hollywood trailer: they had been the best; now the old gang was getting back together for one last job.</p><p>These are not just former teammates, who produced arguably the finest football ever seen; they’re best mates too, people Busquets says share “the same culture, the same jokes, the same upbringing”. At Busquets’ goodbye at the Camp Nou on Thursday, Messi signed off <a href="https://twitter.com/FCBarcelona_cat/status/1663979855396913166?s=20">his video message</a> with an “I love you”, while Busquets describes the Argentinian not only as the “best player of all time” but the pair of them as “personalities that fit, who trust each other”. Iniesta refers to Busquets as a “brother”. And Busquets, asked which player he could most confide in over the years, who’s the funniest and who the grumpiest, cracks up when the answer to all three is Alba.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/05/sergio-busquets-barcelona-chess-what-next-spain">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A tantalising new cop drama, a thrilling trip down the rage super highway and wicked fun on the labour ward – here are the year’s telly highlights up to now</p><p><strong>Disney+<br /></strong>Over its four series, Donald Glover’s always-excellent show seemed determined to stretch the parameters of what one programme could be. Sometimes a horror, sometimes Black Mirror-esque satire, sometimes straight-up rap comedy, it freewheeled not just through genres but also through casts, regularly branching off into episodes containing none of the core characters. For its final run, it opts for a less disparate approach, largely following Earn and co as they get dragged into extended family beefs, flee gunmen and enter a strange hole in the space-time continuum filled with ex-lovers. Not only is it the show’s most focused outing, but the finale is a masterpiece of nuanced, clever writing that leaves you questioning what you’ve just seen – and wondering whether you need to go back and rewatch all four seasons.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/05/the-best-tv-of-2023-so-far">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Following an all-female team of terrifying risk-takers doesn’t really tell us much about the sport, or the daredevils themselves</p><p>This slight, scrappy documentary follows an all-female crew of downhill skateboarders on a road trip to northern Turkey. To the risk-averse, their sport looks suicidally dangerous, like snowboarding on concrete: riders on longboards cutting down steep roads at speeds up to 140kph, leaving cars for dust. The risk of mangled limbs becomes clear five minutes into the film when skater Jennifer Schauerte hits a patch of gravel, comes off her board and slams into a road barrier. The X-ray of the snapped bone in her leg is the most horrific thing I’ve seen in a cinema so far this year.</p><p>Three operations later, Schauerte is impatient – maybe even reckless – in her determination to get back on her board. She’s planning a trip to the mountains of north Turkey in her camper with four friends from the skating scene. Together they are the Woolf Women. (Disappointingly, they are not named in honour of Virginia ­– the extra “o” seems to be a typo that stuck.) It is by no means an essential skateboarding documentary; we don’t learn much about the sport, its history or this group’s place in skateboard culture. Instead, it’s more about chronicling a tribe: cool women travelling wild and free, skinny-dipping in Bulgaria, sitting around the campfire. Schauerte is the star and co-directs with Marchella De Angelis.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/05/woolf-women-now-or-never-review-wild-skateboarding-doc-heads-for-turkey">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Speculation over the musician’s political leanings came to a head when he attended King Charles’s coronation. But his slippery stance has little to do with the dominant political tone</p><p>Until very recently, nobody much cared about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/nick-cave">Nick Cave</a>’s political opinions, including Cave himself. For most of his career, which began in Melbourne in the late 70s, he was too entrenched in the badlands of his imagination to be one of those musicians to whom journalists turned for a righteous line on an election or a war. He has never written a protest song nor aligned himself with a cause. Since 2018, he has sometimes discussed cultural politics in <a href="https://www.theredhandfiles.com/">The Red Hand Files</a>, his online project answering questions from fans, but it is just one part of a mix which spans grief, literature and the end of the world. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/sep/11/nick-cave-on-music-grief-and-spirituality-faith-hope-carnage">Faith, Hope and Carnage</a>, his recent bestselling book of conversations with journalist Seán O’Hagan, delves deep into life, death, God and art but features just one brief exchange about cancel culture. (He’s against it.)</p><p>Lately, however, there has been growing chatter about whether or not the 65-year-old is that rare beast in music, a conservative, and what exactly that would mean. His statements tend to be long on principles, especially his opposition to censorship, but short on details.

## The big idea: Are cats really domesticated?

<p>Unlike dogs, our feline friends are barely different from their wild ancestors – except for a few clever tricks</p><p>Few people would mistake a wolf for a dog. But if you saw the ancestor of the domestic cat in your backyard, your first thought would likely be “What a cool-looking housecat!” rather than “What’s an African wildcat doing in Manchester?” That’s how little they’ve changed, earning them the tag “barely” or “semi-domesticated”. There have been some minor anatomical shifts – domestic cats have longer intestines and smaller brains, for example – but very few genetic ones (and certainly many fewer than separate dogs from their wild ancestors). What about behaviour, then? Which of the traits we commonly associate with our furry friends are the result of domestication, and which do they share with their wild relatives?</p><p>Let’s start with the classic cat sound. Anyone who has lived with a cat has experienced their household companion meowing to them, clearly trying to communicate something or other (perhaps “dinner time” or “Help, I’m locked in the closet”). I had always assumed that cats talked to each other by meowing, and that they were just including us in their social circle. However, detailed behavioural <a href="https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/463206/" title="">observations</a> of unowned groups of cats living in southern England have revealed that they rarely meow among themselves.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/05/the-big-idea-are-cats-really-domesticated">Continue reading...</a>

But there’s one group of people he’s overlooked. Many unpaid family carers like me would love to return to full-time employment. But the failure of successive governments to fix our broken social care system has left us to shoulder caring responsibilities that actively stop us working. We’re trapped.</p><p>Since I was 14, I’ve been caring for my mum after she lost her sight in one eye. As her health got worse over the years, I took on more responsibilities. It’s an experience many unpaid carers talk about. The amount of time you spend caring increases until, almost without you noticing, it has become the overwhelming role in your life. Eventually, I had no choice but to give up my job as a chartered accountant to become Mum’s full-time unpaid carer, living with her at our south-east London home.</p><p>Denise Wilkins is an unpaid carer and former chartered accountant</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/05/social-care-jeremy-hunt-unpaid-carers">Continue reading...</a>

They must defend their top-flight status against Verona next weekend after finishing level in 18th place.</p><p>Not since 2005 has a season ended this way. Serie A had done away with playoffs and playouts, using head-to-head records as a tie-breaker instead.

Where teams contesting those most essential targets ended on equal points, final standings would be established with a one-off match at a neutral ground.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jun/05/serie-a-finale-gets-extended-for-all-or-nothing-survival-showdown-spezia-verona">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Emile Hirsch and John Cusack star in this generic crime caper that might as well have been generated by a screenwriting algorithm</p><p>This generically titled crime thriller revolves around standard-issue conflicts – warring drug lords, kidnapped loved ones, and so on – involving characters with names so generic they sound like they were generated by a screenwriting algorithm: Rick Calloway, Mike Breslin, Zoe Carter are just some of the dishwater-dull examples. But squint very hard and you might see a few imaginative or at least weird touches around the peripheries of the story, like little jocular Easter eggs snuck in by actors and editors working together.</p><p>For example Emile Hirsch, playing the aforementioned Rick Calloway, a facially tattooed master hacker from an old southern crime family led by paterfamilias Jack Calloway (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/john-cusack">John Cusack</a>), plays the whole second half of the film as if he’s whacked up to the eyeballs on super-strong skunk. All his lines are delivered in an amused drone, and throughout the remainder of the film he looks like he’s waiting for all this shooting to stop so he can get a cheeseburger. That sort of goes with the fact that Cusack’s character seems to spend an inordinate amount of screen time grilling meat for his grandson while issuing orders to his lackeys.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/05/pursuit-review-barbecue-loving-gangster-dominates-hacker-thriller">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Deprived of pets for most of my childhood, my first came out of a sachet. They were educational and prize-winning, but I couldn’t overlook their incessant sexual bacchanal</p><p>My oldest friend’s first memory of me is not a flattering one. It was the first week of year seven and we had to interview each other and present our findings. What was my favourite animal, she inquired reasonably. “I hate all animals,” I replied, “apart from maybe squirrels or frogs.” Twenty-two years later, I would like to plead diminished responsibility. This wasn’t really my view, but that of my mum, who really did hate animals.</p><p>So, naturally, we weren’t allowed pets. For a long time, the closest I got was fostering the primary school stick insects during holidays. (I can still tell you the delicate difference between a stick insect poo and an egg. The egg has a dot on it. The other is just a poo.) Then, in year five, I came across Sea-Monkeys. It was the late 90s, and they were marketed as educational toys and sold in bookshops. With all due respect to the late Sea-Monkeys inventor Harold von Braunhut, they are one of history’s greatest cons.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/05/pet-ill-never-forget-sea-monkeys-orgies">Continue reading...</a>

## Rachel Roddy’s recipe for picnic pie with greens and parmesan | A kitchen in Rome

<p>Taking inspiration from both an ancient Roman breakfast dish and summer school days, this pie is packed with flavour</p><p>Figures wearing goggles cut knee-high grass in the park the other day. Like a wasp crossed with a revving motorbike, strimming is a strangely soothing sound. It also takes me back to double chemistry lessons on a June afternoon, the sound and lush smell of the playing field being tamed, drifting in through the window and making my eyes itch.</p><p>While it’s closely associated with grass, the Italian word <em>erba</em> is a generic word for a great number of leaf plants and herbs that don’t develop a woody stem. One of those is wild <em>bietola</em>, or chard, and its cultivated cousins, which provide the dense green filling for <em>l’erbazzone reggiano</em>, a savoury pie typical of Reggio Emilia, eponymous city of parmigiano reggiano and one of nine provinces in Emilia-Romagna.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/05/picnic-pie-greens-parmesan-recipe-rachel-roddy">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Royal Academy, London<br /></strong>From lemons to cats to the inevitable stripper, there is much that is silly and mediocre – then magnificent works by the likes of Gillian Wearing and Paula Rego catch your eye<strong><br /></strong><br /></p><p>Why do they do it? Walking around the Royal Academy’s summer show – “the world’s largest open submission exhibition”, an immense gathering of good, bad and (mostly) mediocre art by amateurs and professionals, the famous and forgettable – you have to wonder, what is that urge to put pencil to paper or, in the case of Ryan Gander, carefully construct a furry simulacrum of a slumbering cat?</p><p>There are paintings here of lemons and toilets, abstract canvases of lines, or nothing at all, a huge hanging blue textile, a jerking robot and, inevitably, a statue of a stripper by Allen Jones: he’s incorrigible, at 85. There seem to be more art than ever – 1,613 pieces to be precise – and unlike recent years, there’s no theme as such, except it’s all apparently inspired by writer EM Forster’s injunction to “only connect”. If the curators really can connect a painting of a Venetian palazzo by 94-year-old Joe Tilson with Michael Robey’s pornographic pastiche of a Greek vase and Carlos Zapata’s lifesized sculpture of a preserved corpse, Bog Man, hats off to them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/05/royal-academy-summer-exhibition-lemons-cats-stripper-wearing-rego">Continue reading...</a>

I couldn’t go out anywhere, go to the gym, eat meat or drink alcohol. I couldn’t do <em>anything</em>, I was so locked in [my own head]. I’d just walk the streets and contemplate suicide.

<p>It has been said to kill E coli, reduce cholesterol, lower blood sugar and aid weight loss. But not all health experts are convinced of its powers</p><p>Feeling peckish one day in 2017, Darshna Yagnik, an immunologist and lecturer in biomedical science at Middlesex University, took a punt on something that had been lurking at the back of the fridge. She soon regretted it and started feeling queasy. Desperate to avoid food poisoning, she racked her brains for something that might help – and remembered the bottle of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/nov/07/how-to-make-apple-cider-vinegar" title="">apple cider vinegar</a> (ACV) in the cupboard. She decided to glug a diluted shot. “Immediately, I felt like there was something going on, combating the bacteria,” she says. “My stomach was gurgling and after about 10 minutes it started feeling soothed. After about half an hour or an hour, I felt much better.”</p><p>At that moment, she realised she was using her own body for research. “I was thinking: what is going on with this apple cider vinegar? This is possibly having an effect on <em>E</em><em> coli</em>. Let me test it in the laboratory.” She went on to do “a multitude of experiments” throughout the pandemic, resulting in <a href="https://eprints.mdx.ac.uk/31862/" title="">a 2021 paper</a> demonstrating that ACV kills <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wor" title="">E coli</a></em> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/mrsa" title="">MRSA</a> in petri dishes almost as effectively as common antibiotics.

<p>The country’s new housing law could change so much – but may be reversed if rightwing parties gain more influence</p><p>A housing revolution is taking place in Spain. On 26 May, a monumental new housing law came into force. It was the culmination of years of work and sought to enshrine housing as a human right. But now that vision is in danger. Two days after the law passed, rightwing parties won seats in local and regional elections. Last week Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez,<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/29/spain-pm-calls-snap-election-after-opposition-and-far-right-wins-in-local-polls-pedro-sanchez"> called a snap election.</a> On 23 July, when Spain goes to the polls, the fate of this law will hang in the balance.</p><p>The origins of the law go back decades. In 1956, José Luis de Arrese, who would become Franco’s first housing minister, said that Spain had to change from “a country of working-class tenants to a country of homeowners”. Governments encouraged property ownership at the expense of renting. It created a new class of social housing – “publicly protected housing”. Unlike your average council home, a publicly protected home is subsidised by the government and offered for sale at an affordable price. Once 30 years have elapsed, it can be sold on the free market.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/05/spain-snap-election-housing-revolution-law-rightwing">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘The end of peak television’: has the era of prestige TV just ground to a halt?

<p>Many of the biggest shows are coming to an end, cancellations are through the roof and miniseries are on the rise. Are the days of the all-conquering television drama numbered?</p><p>Now that Succession has finally lived up to its writers’ most-loved phrase and decided to “fuck off” at the end of its fourth season, it leaves a big question for the TV world. It’s one befitting a show hinged on who was qualified to take over the Roy family business. So, who, or what, will succeed the biggest drama on TV?</p><p>For the past two and a half decades – the much-heralded prestige TV era – it has always seemed there is one series that reigns supreme at any given moment. There is no discernible science to the idea but whoever could gather the winning combination (or at least some components) of critical acclaim, big ratings, award show sweeps and, latterly, social media buzz, fits the bill. It’s those shows for which you dodge online spoilers, that you passionately recommend to anyone who will listen, whose characters loom large from billboards at the train station, and whose Emmy and Bafta wins feel like a lap of honour. They’re the shows you binge seven seasons of in a fortnight and instantly become an evangelist for. You’d call it water-cooler television if anyone worked in the office any more.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/05/the-end-of-peak-television-has-the-era-of-prestige-tv-just-ground-to-a-halt">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Leonie Brandt was an interesting historical character but a lack of curiosity and reliance on re-enactment obfuscates rather than illuminates</p><p>How do you make a film about someone of whom there exists no moving images? Diving into the mysteries surrounding Leonie Brandt, an actor turned double-agent for the Dutch intelligence service during the second world war, Annette Apon’s documentary enlists the extensive archive of the Eye Film Museum, an approach that unfortunately obfuscates rather than illuminates a historical enigma.</p><p>Depicting the “greatest hits” of Brandt’s life, from her brief acting career to her daring exploits in Nazi Germany, the film utilises a wide range of clips mostly from silent movies, the images edited together as literal illustrations of the events recounted by the voiceover. There’s little stylistic purpose here, as the film oscillates between the first-person POV of Brandt and Apon’s third-person perspective. For cinephiles who know their film history, to see footage featuring such recognisable faces as Asta Nielsen used as visual signposts of Brandt’s biography is less than helpful. Sandwiched between these sequences are restaged excerpts of a 1995 interview between a lawyer called Besier who was acquainted with Brandt during the postwar years, and an unnamed researcher. Under these unnecessary layers of artifice and re-enactment, the real Leonie Brandt sadly recedes further into the shadows of the past.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/05/leonie-actress-and-spy-review-greatest-hits-profile-of-mysterious-wartime-double-agent">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Half the country might be waiting for the heat to turn up, but for the rest of us, it’s a time of foreboding and dread</p><p>I don’t really understand why I’m still on Twitter, a mouse hopefully pressing the button that used to dispense treats, but which now only dispenses electric shocks. One reason is that I like the helpful reminders people give – that the clocks are changing, say, or there are only three days left for Christmas postage. Given staring at the internet has eaten 94% of my brain, I am grateful to outsource this basic life admin to civic-minded souls. I especially appreciate it when someone issues a heads-up for hay fever sufferers at the end of winter – when the trees are hatching their plot to kill me but haven’t acted on it yet – to start taking antihistamines.</p><p>So consider this my contribution: summer haters, it might not be particularly warm yet, but the season is here and that’s why you’re feeling bad.

<p>Dr Gladys McGarey thought she would never recover when her husband and work partner walked out after 46 years. Then she found her voice, happiness and her own direction</p><p>“It’s hard to put a size on things that happen in your life,” Gladys McGarey says. At 102, it’s understandable she would feel that way. Shortly before she was 70, her husband, Bill, to whom she had been married for 46 years, handed her divorce papers. He had been carrying them in his briefcase for six months and said he would appreciate a prompt signature.</p><p>McGarey and Bill had not only been married for decades but were also close colleagues. They were both doctors, who had trained as general practitioners, and were among the co-founders of the American Holistic Medical Association in 1978. For the duration of their marriage, they had shared a clinic in Phoenix, Arizona, as well as having six children together. So, when the marriage ended – Bill had started a relationship with another colleague – McGarey lost not only her life partner but her business partner, too.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/05/a-new-start-after-60-i-was-devastated-by-divorce-at-70-but-at-102-i-know-the-secrets-of-a-well-lived-life">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When the TV star and property expert found out she had cancer, her seemingly idyllic life turned upside down. Now given the all-clear, she discusses the diagnosis, the early death of her mother and the power of escapism</p><p>If you’ve seen Sarah Beeny’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/nov/30/new-life-in-the-country-sarah-beeny-proves-shes-the-mum-you-always-wanted">New Life in the Country</a>, you will know exactly what her house is like: unimaginably vast, unsettlingly new, modelled on a stately home but manifestly not one, like a fairytale you’re slightly too old for. But even knowing it inside out, I was still surprised to find that it actually existed, that anyone lives like that. You enter through a porch into a massive boot room, where everyone in the family has a floor-to-ceiling locker, stencilled with their name, which is what, I guess, contributes to the incredible sense of order, the un-stately-home tidiness. The rolling view from the dining room windows is enough to make you drop to your knees in quasi-religious thanksgiving. “Sometimes I have the doors open and think: ‘This is actually not real,’” she says. “This is like a holiday camp.” Even her dogs, who caper into the high-ceilinged drawing room, oblivious to how charming sitting on that Chesterfield is going to make them look, are perfect.</p><p>Beeny has adapted seamlessly to the dress code of The Simple Life (the title of her book about this escapade, published this August); she’s a jeans and shirt and (probably, when she’s going outdoors) wellies person now, after more than two decades of her distinctive, rock-chick-goes-to-a-meeting-with-the-bank-manager style.

## At the Edge of the Woods by Kathryn Bromwich review – an accomplished, unsettling debut

<p>A woman retreats to a forest in northern Italy in an immersive first novel that explores what it means to inhabit a female body yet reject femininity</p><p>Kathryn Bromwich’s accomplished debut novel begins in a deceptively pastoral register. Her narrator, Laura, is an educated woman who has purposefully removed herself from society to rent a tumbledown cabin in a forest in the mountains of northern Italy. On her first encounter with the reader she presents herself with all the tropes of a fairytale crone: she walks up the mountain at dawn, wrapped in “layer upon layer of coarse, heavy clothing”. She is conscious of how she appears to the few people who pass her on the mountain paths: “all matted fabric and dirt and ill-concealed truculence”, and yet, alone in the natural world, she can sometimes achieve a state of transcendence that is denied her in the nearby village, where “I make myself smaller, softer, amenable to human interaction”.</p><p>Despite the pleasure Laura takes in allowing herself to become semi-feral in her solitude, she depends on not alienating the villagers, who give her piecemeal work, with her strangeness: “I endeavour to maintain a veneer of respectability: cleanliness, manners, a subdued demeanour toward men.” The exact period of the story is left unclear, adding to the folkloric sense of timelessness, but there are enough clues to place it in the early 20th century: Laura has a laudanum habit, her cabin was previously occupied by a soldier rumoured to be a conscientious objector. Whatever the exact year, it’s an age in which a woman choosing to live alone in a forest attracts first gossip and then suspicion from a conservative rural community, particularly if – matted fabric notwithstanding – she is not yet 40 and “remnants of my beauty flash through on occasion”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/05/at-the-edge-of-the-woods-by-kathryn-bromwich-review-an-accomplished-unsettling-debut">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The seller failed to get conversion warranty but bought retrospective one, while broker suggested secured loan to us</p><p><strong>Q</strong> My husband and I have recently sold our first home in the south-east and now have £300,000 in our bank account. We would like to buy a beautiful property farther north for the agreed price of £380,000. It is a three-bedroom flat that is over two floors in the top half of a Georgian house (it includes an attic conversion) with its own private entrance. However, there are complications: first, it is Grade I-listed; second, it seems the seller, who converted it from one single non-domestic building to three separate properties (there is a flat and a proposed cafe downstairs), failed to get a conversion warranty (he didn’t know this was required).</p><p>The first bank we approached (for an £80,000 mortgage) said the property was not mortgageable because of the lack of the conversion warranty (apparently the fact that the seller bought the property more than 10 years ago and has been converting it without living in it means that the warranty is required). The seller then bought a retrospective warranty, and we approached a mortgage broker. However, the mortgage broker has been unable to find a lender who will consider the property mortgageable: some lenders are happy with a Grade I-listed property, some are happy with a retrospective warranty but none, it seems, are happy with both.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jun/05/we-cant-get-a-mortgage-to-help-us-buy-a-listed-property-should-we-find-another-way">Continue reading...</a>

## For better or for worse: is the decline in marriage actually good for relationships? | Devorah Baum

<p>While some countries turn marriage into a patriotic act, it might just give us a radical new way to live our lives</p><p>One of the curious things about marriage is the role it’s played in embedding commonly held views about normality. Married people are generally considered normal people. As such, they have possessed inordinate power to dictate the terms of normality in a way that single people rarely can. And yet marriage, clearly, isn’t for everyone. Plenty of people have no desire to do it. Plenty of others have done it and haven’t liked it. The stats only corroborate this. Fewer people over the years have been getting married, while the stresses and strains of lockdown in 2020 (along with the temporary closure of venues) saw divorces in England and Wales <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/marriagecohabitationandcivilpartnerships/bulletins/marriagesinenglandandwalesprovisional/2020">overtake weddings</a> for the first time.</p><p>Not everyone, however, is taking marriage’s declining popularity lying down. At the recent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/17/10-things-we-learned-from-the-uk-natcon-conference">National Conservatism conference</a>, delegates were promised a national revival founded on “faith, family and flag”. Likewise, China has just <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64594469">proposed a list of measures</a> to actively encourage its young women to marry and have children (and not just one child any more: three, ideally). This is a national policy, but it’s one with global benefits: to stem the threat of economic stagnation, growing the population is supposed to ensure the continuity of a <a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2023/01/17/china-population-decline-birth-rate-global-economy-impact/11066270002/">huge, and therefore cheap, labour force</a>. In other words, unless more Chinese women have more children, we’ll all have to pay more for our merch – with matrimony here (never mind that not everyone who marries has children and not everyone who has children gets married) still framed by national governments as the gateway to maternity first of all. Other countries may well follow China’s lead. In <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/01/asia/japan-births-2022-record-low-intl-hnk/index.html">Japan</a>, where they’ve just recorded a seventh consecutive year of declining birthrates, and fewer couplings, the government is accused of failing to act quickly enough to mitigate the effects of a rapidly ageing population.</p><p>Devorah Baum is associate professor of English literature at the University of Southampton and the author of <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/on-marriage-9780241618011?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article">On Marriage</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/05/decline-marriage-married-wedded-patriotic">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As the world’s biggest rainforest degrades fast towards its tipping point, finding solutions is more urgent than ever.

The other side of the river is even worse, as this is the site of the biggest hydroelectric dam in the Amazon – a Mordor-esque rampart of concrete behind which lies a cemetery of thousands of white trees drowned by the reservoir.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/05/rethink-reform-rebuild-7-steps-to-save-the-amazon">Continue reading...</a>

## Peter Howson on his war art: ‘People were horrified. Then David Bowie bought it’

<p>He was the official artist of the Bosnian conflict but paid a terrible price. The Scot, loved by celebrities from Bowie to Madonna, talks about the day he lost all hope, overcoming his addictions – and finding peace walking his dog Buster</p><p>‘It’s like seeing old friends again,” says Peter Howson, looking both pleased and perplexed as he rubs a thick hand across his face. He is not talking about people but canvases, the ones now being hung in an Edinburgh gallery for a retrospective to mark his 65th birthday that will bring together around 100 works spanning his career as one of Scotland’s leading figurative painters.</p><p>Howson is an artist renowned for capturing men at their most brutal extremes, from the hyper-muscled football hooligans of his early work to the flexing soldiers of Putin’s private army in recent paintings, prompted by the war in Ukraine. But in person he is the polar opposite: vulnerable, self-critical, an apologist for his own excesses. His friend, the painter John Bellany, once told him: “Me and you were like volcanoes, spewing out all this stuff. A lot of it’s rubbish and a lot of it’s quite good.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/05/peter-howson-retrospective-edinburgh-bowie-madonna-war-bosnian">Continue reading...</a>

It is days after a court in Muzaffarnagar found two Hindu men guilty of gang-raping her and holding a gun to her baby son’s head. A third man died before the case came to court.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/jun/05/india-woman-10-year-fight-for-justice-against-gang-rapists">Continue reading...</a>
