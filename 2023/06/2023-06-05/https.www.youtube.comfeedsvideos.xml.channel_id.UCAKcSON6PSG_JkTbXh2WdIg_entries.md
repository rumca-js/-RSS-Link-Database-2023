On Saturday, April 8, 2023, London-based six-piece rock band Sports Team played a raucous, hourlong show at Green Room, one of the newest venues in Minneapolis. The audience consisted of lucky winners who had entered for a chance to attend this one-of-a-kind performance.

Sports Team released their second studio album, Gulp!, in September 2022.  The record followed their 2020 Mercury Prize-nominated debut album Deep Down Happy, which charted at No. 2 in the U.K.’s Official Charts, achieving the highest vinyl sales for a debut British artist in 2020.
