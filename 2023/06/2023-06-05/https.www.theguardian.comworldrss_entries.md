This week, Prince Harry will make another unprecedented move for a senior royal, as he gives evidence in a phone hacking court case against Mirror Group Newspapers, the owner of the Daily Mirror, the Sunday Mirror and the Sunday People. The lawsuit alleges that the company unlawfully gathered information on the prince between 1996 and 2011 that was published in its papers, and that senior executives and editors were aware of this activity. This lawsuit is one of three entirely separate but concurrent phone hacking claims that Prince Harry is making: the other two are against Rupert Murdoch’s News Group Newspapers, and the Mail newspapers.</p><p>While he is one of the most high profile players in the lawsuit, Harry is not the only claimant. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/02/harry-v-the-mirror-what-will-happen-when-the-prince-takes-the-stand">More than 100 other people</a> are suing the Mirror Group, including ex-footballer and TV presenter Ian Wright, Girls Aloud star Cheryl Cole, and the estate of the late singer George Michael.
