[{"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Apple\u2019s M2 Ultra chip chases the Hollywood elite", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple&rsquo;s new M2 Ultra chip pursues the same niche of Apple users as its predecessor, the M1 Ultra: crazy power users who need to edit and compile multiple high-resolution video streams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most people surf the web, play games, and write emails on their laptops and desktops. That&rsquo;s certainly not the market being addressed by the second-generation Mac Studio, a $1,999 desktop that&rsquo;s zeroing in on professional video editors. The Studio ships with either the option of an existing M2 Max chip, or the new M2 Ultra. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Essentially, the M2 Ultra is two M2 Max chips stitched together, with a total of 24 CPU cores and 76 GPU cores. (The <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/620879/apple-adds-monster-chip-the-new-apple-m1-ultra.html\">M1 Ultra combined two M1 Max dies</a> for 20 CPU cores and a 64-core GPU, spread across more than 100 billion transistors.) All told, Apple claims that the new M2 Ultra chip will deliver 20 percent faster CPU performance than the M1 Ultra, and 30 percent faster GPU performance than the M1 Ultra, as well. With the launch of the Apple Mac Studio and the M2 Ultra, all of Apple&rsquo;s hardware has now switched over to Apple&rsquo;s own silicon, executives said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Who needs this? Well, in an ideal environment, the chip could be used to train large machine-learning models, using its massive 192GB of addressable memory &mdash; 50 percent more than the M1 Ultra. Most environments use GPUs and their high-speed video memory to perform these tasks, but they&rsquo;d run out of available memory, according to Jennifer Munn, Apple&rsquo;s director of engineering and program management. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mac Studios, however, will see some real results: DaVinci Resolve users should see video processing times drop by half, and 3D Octane users will be able to render their models three times faster, Apple said. It&rsquo;s also six times faster than an Intel-based iMac Apple ships. Finally, video editors will be able to play back 22 streams of 8K Pro Res video &mdash; &rdquo; no other computer in the world comes close,&rdquo; Munn said, at the Mac Studio&rsquo;s launch. (If that&rsquo;s something you want to do, buy a Mac!)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, it appears that the M2 Ultra chip and the Mac Studio now support higher-speed HDMI (though Apple didn&rsquo;t disclose which version), with 8K resolution and support for 240Hz frame rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Mac Studio will be available on June 13, from $1,999. A version with the M2 Ultra chip inside will be priced at $3,999.  Each Mac Studio ships with two Thunderbolt 4 ports on the front, plus an SDXC slot; in the rear there are four more Thunderbolt 4 ports, two USB-A ports, an HDMI port, one 10Gbps ethernet port, and a headphone jack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note, the $3,999 version only ships with a 60-core GPU. If you want the full 76-core GPU option, you&rsquo;ll pay an additional $1,000, or $4,999. If you&rsquo;d like, you can add 128GB of memory ($800) or 192GB ($1,600) and either 2TB, 4TB, or 8TB of SSD storage. All told, the extra bells and whistles <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/mac-studio/24-core-cpu-60-core-gpu-32-core-neural-engine-64gb-memory-1tb&amp;xcust=2-1-1942236-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">could run you $8,799</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spiking the ball against Apple&rsquo;s own Intel-based hardware is a <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1475775/apples-m2-pro-macbooks-will-get-smoked-by-new-pc-chips-but-it-doesnt-matter.html\">strategy we&rsquo;ve seen before</a>, both by Apple as well as its competitors. That doesn&rsquo;t diminish the power of the M2 Ultra. Just don&rsquo;t expect it in hardware that the average user will use anytime soon. Given the launch of the $3,500 Apple Vision Pro AR headset at the same time, one might think that out-of-reachness was the theme of Apple&rsquo;s 2023 WWDC showcase.</p>\n\nDesktop PCs</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1942236/apples-m2-ultra-chip-chases-the-hollywood-elite.html", "date_published": "2023-06-05 20:18:17+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Your PC might have a malicious Chrome extension installed", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>If your search results have seemed off, or you&rsquo;ve noticed an uptick in unwanted ads, you might have accidentally installed one of the 32 malicious Chrome extensions recently struck from the Chrome Web Store.

The Shenzen-based company made its name on emulation-friendly devices like the Android-based GPD XD, before moving on to Windows-based designs like the GPD Pocket mini laptop or the GPD Win 4, a Steam Deck competitor. But the company&rsquo;s newest design is a horse of a different color. It&rsquo;s a tiny external GPU that can punch up the graphics of any laptop or Windows-powered portable device. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>GPD is calling it the G1, and like most of its other hardware, it&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.indiegogo.com/project/preview/216c9fb3#/&amp;xcust=2-2-1941374-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">starting with a crowdfunding campaign</a>. (Normally we don&rsquo;t cover crowdfunded projects, but GPD has proven its ability to deliver with dozens of devices). The gadget hides an AMD <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1445710/amd-announces-rdna3-mobile-gpus-next-gen-software.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Radeon RX 7600M XT</a>, a laptop GPU, inside its sleek aluminum housing. The GPD G1 uses a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.delock.com/infothek/OCuLink/oculink_e.html&amp;xcust=2-2-1941374-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">dedicated eGPU port called Oculink</a>, a PCI-based standard supported on GPD&rsquo;s mini-gaming devices and some competitors. But crucially, it also supports USB4 and Thunderbolt 4 (backwards compatible to Thunderbolt 3), which means it&rsquo;ll work with most of the laptops on the market right now. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"GPD G1 external GPU dock with portable gaming gadget\" class=\"wp-image-1941435\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/gpd-g1-egpu-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">GPD</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The G1 also works as a more general portable dock, including an HDMI 2.1 port, double DisplayPort, triple USB 3.2 type A ports, and a full-sized SD card reader. The semi-proprietary laptop power cable is a bit of a bummer, but a small price to pay for such a compact and useful little gadget. Devices with <em>both </em>Oculink and Thunderbolt 4 (like GPD&rsquo;s WinMax2) can maximize the gadget&rsquo;s throughput for external devices and GPU-powered video. At a bit under nine inches wide and 1.2 inches thick, it should be easy enough to throw into a laptop bag or a suitcase. Just don&rsquo;t try to stuff it in there &mdash; the 240-watt internal power supply needs active cooling. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mobile GPU inside the G1 means it can&rsquo;t be upgraded like desktop-style eGPUs. That makes it something like the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1667601/this-asus-dock-will-give-a-tiny-laptop-rtx-4090-powers-for-a-high-price.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Asus ROG XG Mobile</a>, which offers a lot more power with the latest RTX 4090 mobile card inside. (GPD says the RG 7600M XT can meet or beat a desktop RTX 3070, for what it&rsquo;s worth). But there are two crucial differences: One, the Asus eGPU only works with a handful of Asus gaming laptops and tablets thanks to a proprietary connection. And two, the GPD G1 will probably cost a lot less than Asus&rsquo; $2,000 starting point. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>How much, exactly? GPD isn&rsquo;t saying yet. But <a

little device that comes with its own nifty carrying case. But whatever EPOS did to shrink this webcam down sacrificed something essential: It has trouble simply holding on to some displays.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply put, this is one of those products that might work for you, or it might not&mdash;and at over $150, you might not want to deal with the hassle of finding out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We really don&rsquo;t have many complaints with either the 4K webcam itself or the integrated dual noise-cancelling mics. A small dial built into the webcam closes a hardware iris that serves a privacy shutter, and a small white LED signals when the camera is active.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>Further reading:</strong> See our roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/393756/1080p-webcam-buying-guide.html\">best webcams</a> to learn about competing products.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>EPOS is one of the few webcam manufacturers to bundle everything inside a nice protective carrying case, which the compact (2.3 x 1.2 x 1.7in) webcam neatly fits into. It&rsquo;s the angled USB-C connector that signals something&rsquo;s a little different about this camera, however. The cable is relatively lengthy, at about 46 inches, long enough to allow the webcam to perch on top of a desktop monitor. That&rsquo;s where the problems start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Webcams don&rsquo;t need to be deep, but they usually are. Take the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1926085/emeet-smartcam-c960-webcam-review.html\">eMeet SmartCam C960</a>: It&rsquo;s not a particularly pretty webcam, with a camera assembly that&rsquo;s just over an inch deep. The Expand Vision 1 is similar, or about 1.2 inches at most. But eMeet wasn&rsquo;t afraid to attach it to a base that&rsquo;s almost 2.5 inches long, and so the C960 does its job: it comfortably grips virtually all of the displays you&rsquo;ll want to attach it to.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-jetpack-image-compare\"><div class=\"juxtapose\"><img alt=\"EPOS Expand Vision 1\" class=\"image-compare__image-before\" height=\"3000\" id=\"1933374\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Epos-Epand-vision-1-clamp.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"4000\" /><img alt=\"EPOS Expand Vision 1\" class=\"image-compare__image-after\" height=\"1706\" id=\"1933372\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/EPOS-Expand-Vision-1-clamp-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"2561\" /></div><figcaption>The EPOS Expand Vision 1&rsquo;s clamp doesn&rsquo;t extend far enough, so that the camera can&rsquo;t grasp bigger displays. Instead, it simply balances upon them.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>EPOS sacrifices this flexibility in favor of aesthetics. EPOS uses a similar &ldquo;jaws&rdquo; design to allow the webcam to grab on to a monitor, but the ridges aren&rsquo;t long enough or pronounced enough to provide solid contact. To be fair, the Expand Vision 1 held well to one desktop monitor. Another, a slightly thicker display aimed at the professional space, simply was too thick for the Expand Vision 1. I managed to fit the Expand Vision 1 onto my laptop, but I had to tilt the display to accommodate the camera because the front jaw or tooth wasn&rsquo;t long enough. It was just too much hassle to align properly, let alone actually use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, the images the camera produces are pretty good. It was a little surprising how well the Expand Vision 1 did in what I consider a more dimly-lit office environment compared to a more brightly-lit room upstairs. While the EPOS documentation claims that this webcam can shoot video at up to 4K at 60Hz, Windows reported that this webcam would only shoot video at 30Hz, at all of its supported resolutions.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"EPOS Expand Vision 1 office\" class=\"wp-image-1933366\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/EPOS-Expand-Vision-1-office.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>We&rsquo;ve used a screenshot of the Windows Camera app to show off the EPOS Expand Vision 1 in a downstairs office.

At first the utility couldn&rsquo;t find the camera; I had to re-connect a second time for the two to pair.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s really no point in using it, though. The utility promises pan and zoom features, as well as a controllable field of view from a &ldquo;wide angle&rdquo; to a closeup. The changes are infinitesimal, however. The white balance is slightly better, though not by much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one plus?

(Unlike Reddit users, who are easy to argue with constantly). But an upcoming policy change could radically alter the way Reddit users interact with the site. Some of them, including leaders of the site&rsquo;s internal communities called subreddits, are fighting back. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The issue is a shift in how Reddit administers its API. For over a decade, third-party apps have had nearly unlimited access to Reddit posts and comments, giving rise to a wide and deep collection of mobile apps on Android and iOS. Beginning on July 1st, Reddit will begin charging for API calls from third-party apps, starting at 24 cents USD for 1,000 calls. An electronic call is made nearly every time an app requests data from a Reddit server. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/5/23749188/reddit-subreddit-private-protest-api-changes-apollo-charges&amp;xcust=2-1-1941251-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">As The Verge reports</a>, with millions of users and billions of calls per month, popular third-party apps like Apollo and Reddit is Fun could be <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/13wxepd/rif_dev_here_reddits_api_changes_will_likely_kill/&amp;xcust=2-1-1941251-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">on the hook for tens of millions of dollars a year</a> in charges &mdash; essentially a death blow to these free or low-priced apps. Other popular apps that could be forced to shut down include BaconReader, Relay, and Narwhal, whose developer says the app will be &ldquo;dead in 30 days&rdquo; if the policy change goes through. The policy changes also restrict third-party advertising &mdash; a major revenue stream for independent apps &mdash; and access to the platform&rsquo;s popular and controversial adult communities along with management tools for subreddit moderators. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Reddit search results, iOS app store\" class=\"wp-image-1941345\" height=\"653\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-05-at-9.54.59-AM.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Third-party devs aren&rsquo;t the only ones expressing their frustration.

On June 12th, the subreddits will go dark, closing all access to outsiders and insiders alike. Some will return to normal after 48 hours, but others will remain closed indefinitely up to and past the July 1st deadline, if Reddit&rsquo;s policy remains in place. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many users believe that the change in pricing and content policy is effectively a poison pill, intended to force these third-party mobile apps to shut down and make way for Reddit&rsquo;s official Android and iOS app. It mirrors a move by Twitter, which <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1479844/twitter-officially-bans-third-party-apps.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">banned third-party apps</a> at the beginning of 2023 and shut down a thriving cottage industry of mobile apps. (Twitter is <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-30/twitter-is-worth-33-of-musk-s-purchase-price-fidelity-says&amp;xcust=2-1-1941251-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">worth a fraction of what it was</a> when new owner Elon Musk took over, but there have been so many radical policy shifts it&rsquo;s hard to pin on just one). Reddit&rsquo;s official app offers advertising that directly benefits the company while many third-party Reddit apps don&rsquo;t show ads at all or use outside ad networks that pay the developer instead of Reddit. Reddit hasn&rsquo;t shown any alternatives to its price increase, such as revenue sharing for advertising. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>More subreddits are joining the planned protest constantly. Reddit is headed for an unavoidable conflict with its most prolific and influential users. The question seems to be, will the owners of the site dig in and wrestle power away from some of the people who made it such a popular and wide-open destination, or will the users successfully flex their own muscles as the site&rsquo;s content providers?

Unlike traditional web hosting providers, DigitalOcean offers cloud-based infrastructure services, allowing users to deploy and manage applications and websites on virtual servers, known as &ldquo;droplets.&rdquo; This cloud-based model provides high flexibility and scalability, making it an excellent choice for developers and businesses with growing needs.</p>\n\n<p>One of DigitalOcean&rsquo;s key selling points is its customization options. Users have the flexibility to choose the exact amount of memory, CPU, and SSD storage that their projects require, allowing them to tailor their hosting environment to their specific needs. DigitalOcean also provides the option of choosing from pre-configured droplets with popular apps and development stacks already installed, which can save considerable time and effort.</p>\n\n<p>DigitalOcean&rsquo;s robust API is another major draw for developers. It allows for programmatic control of resources, enabling users to automate tasks, integrate with other services, and generally manage their hosting environment more efficiently. This level of control and automation is a significant advantage for developers who want to optimize their workflows.</p>\n\n<p>Alongside these developer-friendly features, DigitalOcean provides a wealth of educational resources aimed at developers. Its community tutorials are known for their depth and quality, covering a wide range of topics from basic server setup to advanced topics like Kubernetes deployment.</p>\n\n<p>From a performance standpoint, DigitalOcean doesn&rsquo;t disappoint. It uses SSD storage across all its plans, which can significantly enhance the speed and responsiveness of your apps or websites. Its data centers are spread across multiple locations worldwide, allowing you to deploy your applications closer to your users for improved performance.</p>\n\n<p>DigitalOcean&rsquo;s pricing model is another major advantage, particularly for developers working on multiple projects. Its transparent, pay-as-you-go pricing ensures that you only pay for the resources you use, with no hidden charges or long-term contracts.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1806027/digital-ocean-web-hosting-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDigitalOcean review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"ad page-ad has-ad-prefix ad-article\"></div>\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-separator\"></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-chart-item product-chart-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-chart-item__title-wrapper--title product-chart-title \" id=\"bluehost-best-for-novices\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBluehost &ndash; Best for novices\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"large-pro-cons-product-chart-section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproduct-chart-item__image-outer-wrapper--large\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Bluehost - Best for novices\" class=\"product-chart-item__image\" height=\"1013\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Bluehost_Logo_PNG2.png\" width=\"1800\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-columns\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tCompetitive introductory pricing\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tGenerous features\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tBeginner friendly, with customer support services such as website migration and a dedicated team of WordPress experts\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t30-day refund policy\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"product-chart-subTitle\">Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"product-pros-cons-list\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tLags behind competitors in support and reliability\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tSteep price increase after initial purchase period\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tDocumentation isn&rsquo;t easily found on the website\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tStorage is limited, particularly in the Basic plan, which has been reduced from previous offerings\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__information \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"not-amp\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-chart-item__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bluehost.com/hosting/shared&amp;xcust=2-1-1937668-6-1477057-20829&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$2.95 at  Bluehost</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>Bluehost has solidified its position as a top choice for beginners with its commitment to providing a straightforward and intuitive web hosting experience.

One of its key selling points is its extensive range of hosting plans, encompassing shared hosting, VPS hosting, dedicated servers, and even specialized WordPress and reseller hosting. This means that whatever the size or growth rate of your website or online business, HostGator has a plan that can cater to your specific needs.</p>\n\n<p>What makes HostGator particularly appealing for scalability is how easily users can switch between plans. As your website grows and attracts more traffic, you can effortlessly upgrade to a higher-tier plan with more resources. Or, if you find that you&rsquo;re not utilizing all the resources in your current plan, you can downgrade to a more cost-effective package. This flexibility is a key advantage for businesses expecting fluctuations in their website&rsquo;s growth and traffic.</p>\n\n<p>HostGator also stands out with its &lsquo;unmetered&rsquo; offerings. Most of its plans come with unmetered bandwidth and disk space, which means there aren&rsquo;t strict limits on the amount of traffic or data your website can handle.

Here&rsquo;s what individuals and businesses should look for in a web hosting service.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"storage-and-bandwidth\">Storage and bandwidth</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most web hosting services offer a variety of plans with different levels of storage and bandwidth. Storage refers to the amount of space available for your website files, while bandwidth determines how much data your website can transfer to its visitors. A higher storage and bandwidth allowance can accommodate more complex, media-rich websites and larger volumes of traffic. However, not every site needs vast amounts of storage and bandwidth. Those with simpler websites or less traffic may opt for lower-tier plans to save costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"uptime-and-speed\">Uptime and speed</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Uptime refers to the percentage of time your website is accessible to visitors. Most hosts aim for an uptime of 99.9 percent or higher, ensuring your site is nearly always available. Speed, on the other hand, determines how quickly your website loads for visitors. Both are crucial for providing a good user experience and can impact your site&rsquo;s search engine rankings. While many factors can influence your site&rsquo;s speed, a good host will have optimized infrastructure to ensure quick load times.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"customer-support\">Customer support</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Good customer support is essential in a web hosting service. Even with the best plans, you might encounter issues or have questions that need addressing. A host with round-the-clock support via multiple channels (such as phone, live chat, and email) can provide peace of mind. Also, a host that offers a comprehensive knowledge base can be invaluable, allowing you to troubleshoot issues or learn more about managing your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"security-features\">Security features</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Security is a crucial aspect of any web hosting service. Look for hosts that offer features such as SSL certificates (for secure data transfer), regular backups (to safeguard your data), and malware scanning and removal. These features can protect your website from various security threats and help keep your visitors&rsquo; data safe.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"scalability\">Scalability</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As your website grows, your hosting needs may change. A good web hosting service will offer plans that can scale with your website.

They also didn&rsquo;t include some features that were table stakes in dedicated password managers, such as the ability to generate secure passwords when signing up for new services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, they didn&rsquo;t deliver the main benefit of using a dedicated password manager such as Dashlane or Bitwarden, which is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/709052/6-common-reasons-people-dont-use-a-password-manager-and-why-theyre-wrong.html\">to keep you from using the same weak passwords everywhere</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But a lot&rsquo;s changed since then:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>In 2020, Google added&nbsp;<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/30/chrome-ios-password-manager/&amp;xcust=2-3-1931902-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">auto-fill support in Chrome for iOS</a>, so if the browser is installed on your phone and synced to your Google account, it can fill out passwords in other apps.

They all have the ability to generate strong passwords on your behalf, and they can alert you to any passwords that are weak, redundant, or stolen. Apple even added&nbsp;<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://tidbits.com/2021/10/07/add-two-factor-codes-to-password-entries-in-ios-15-ipados-15-and-safari-15/&amp;xcust=2-3-1931902-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">two-factor authentication code support</a>&nbsp;to iCloud in 2021, so you don&rsquo;t need a separate app to help&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1376010/how-to-use-two-factor-authentication-to-lock-down-your-accounts-the-right-way.html\">lock down your accounts</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of which adds up to a compelling case for whatever password manager is built into your favorite web browser. Compared to dedicated password managers, the setup process is minimal, and they&rsquo;ll likely never cost you anything, so I suspect that lot of people will use those default password tools without even thinking about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"so-whats-the-problem\">So what&rsquo;s the problem?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The main reason I don&rsquo;t rely on any of these password managers is largely about flexibility. I have a borderline obsession with not being permanently tied any particular device or computing platform, and these built-in password managers can ultimately be another mechanism for lock-in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since I&rsquo;m using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1339204/why-i-switched-to-bitwarden-for-my-password-manager.html\">Bitwarden as my password manager</a>, bringing my passwords to a new device or web browser only requires installing the Bitwarden app or browser extension, then logging in, and my passwords automatically sync no matter where I am. With built-in password managers, switching can be more of a hassle:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Microsoft, to its credit, offers&nbsp;<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/microsoft-autofill/fiedbfgcleddlbcmgdigjgdfcggjcion&amp;xcust=2-3-1931902-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">a Chrome extension</a>&nbsp;for accessing your passwords outside of Edge, but it doesn&rsquo;t offer add-ons for Firefox or MacOS Safari. If you want to use those browsers, you&rsquo;ll need to import your password list from Edge.</li><li>Chrome has no way to sync your passwords in other browsers, so whenever you switch, you&rsquo;ll have to import your Chrome password list.</li><li>With iCloud Passwords, you can&rsquo;t access your passwords on Android or sync passwords in Windows browsers other than Chrome and Edge. And unless you have a Mac, you can&rsquo;t export your passwords to a different service at all.</li><li>Some alternative browsers, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://vivaldi.com/&amp;xcust=2-3-1931902-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vivaldi</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://brave.com/&amp;xcust=2-3-1931902-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brave</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.opera.com/&amp;xcust=2-3-1931902-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Opera</a>, don&rsquo;t offer auto-fill features for mobile apps.

The major browsers still don&rsquo;t offer group sharing options so that family members can easily log into shared services. Some password managers can also auto-fill passwords in desktop apps&mdash;Chrome, Edge, and Firefox can&rsquo;t do this&mdash;and they have their own standalone mobile apps that make it easy to view your credentials from anywhere. Bitwarden even lets you plug in <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1477176/get-your-email-privacy-in-order-with-these-free-must-use-tools.html\">masked email addresses</a> from a wide range of providers, while 1Password integrates with Privacy.com for <a href=\"https://www.techhive.com/article/1061849/control-your-streaming-costs-with-limited-use-credit-cards.html\">limited-use credit cards</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for me, the option to seamlessly switch between browsers or devices is by far the biggest factor. Being able to try new tools&mdash;or abandon ones that no longer work well&mdash;is important to me, and I never want something as mundane as passwords to get in the way.

The new Legion 5 Pro looks to reinforce this with the latest Intel 13th-Gen processors and Nvidia RTX 4060 graphics. They provide a notable boost over last year&rsquo;s model and maintain the Legion 5 Pro&rsquo;s position as a go-to gaming laptop for those looking to spend less than $2,000.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Looking for more options?

This includes the Intel Core i7-13700HX, a 16-core processor with 24 threads and a maximum Turbo Boost frequency of 5GHz. It&rsquo;s joined by Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX 4060, which in this iteration can tap up to 140 watts of power.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>CPU: Intel Core i7-13700HX</li><li>Memory: 16GB LPDDR5</li><li>Graphics/GPU: Nvidia RTX 4060 (140-watt TGP)</li><li>Display: 16-inch 2,560 x 1,600 165Hz IPS</li><li>Storage: 512GB PCIe Gen4 SSD</li><li>Webcam: 1080p with electronic privacy shutter</li><li>Connectivity: 1x USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 with DisplayPort 1.4 and 140 watts Power Delivery, 1x USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 with DisplayPort 1.4, 3x USB-A 3.2 Gen 1,1x HDMI 2.1, 1x Ethernet, 1x 3.5mm combo audio</li><li>Networking: WiFi 6E, Bluetooth</li><li>Biometrics: None</li><li>Battery capacity: 80 watt-hours</li><li>Dimensions: 14.3 x 10.25 x 1.05 inches</li><li>Weight: 5.51 pounds</li><li>MSRP: $1,699.99 MSRP, $1,449.99 retail</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Pricing starts at $1,259.99 through Lenovo&rsquo;s website. That will snag you a less capable machine with an Intel Core i5-13500HX and Nvidia RTX 4060. The model I tested was priced at $1,449.99, less than $200 more than the entry-level despite a big upgrade to both the CPU and GPU.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"lenovo-legion-5-pro-design-and-build-quality\">Lenovo Legion 5 Pro: Design and build quality</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Lenovo Legion design\" class=\"wp-image-1921267\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/784A1114.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Lenovo Legion Pro 5 is cloaked in a reserved navy-blue and black chassis. It uses simple, mostly untextured plastics that don&rsquo;t look or feel remarkable but manages a more polished, professional vibe than alternatives such as the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1070976/1070976.html\">Acer Predator Helios</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1801913/asus-tuf-gaming-a16-advantage-edition-review.html\">Asus TUF Gaming A16</a>, and Dell Inspiron Gaming. It&rsquo;s clearly a laptop designed for performance yet won&rsquo;t attract unwanted attention in a meeting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It won&rsquo;t take up the entire table, either. Measuring at 14.3 inches wide and 10.25 inches deep, the Lenovo Legion Pro 5 is reasonably compact for a 16-inch gaming laptop, though it will still feel most laptop bags to capacity. Its size is most noticeable in profile, as the Legion Pro 5 measures a tad over an inch thick&mdash;a trait you&rsquo;ll certainly notice while handling the machine. It also tips the scales at 5.6 pounds, which is similar to competitive laptops but rather noticeable when placed in a backpack or messenger bag.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lenovo&rsquo;s build quality doesn&rsquo;t disappoint. The chassis is solid and uncomplaining, with no creaks or groans to betray its plastic origins. There&rsquo;s some give here and there, most notably in the display lid when you&rsquo;re opening and closing it, but nothing to sound alarm bells. In fact, it&rsquo;s right up there with the competition, offering a similar degree of rigidity and durability.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"lenovo-legion-5-pro-keyboard-trackpad\">Lenovo Legion 5 Pro: Keyboard, trackpad</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Lenovo Legion keyboard\" class=\"wp-image-1921269\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/784A1125.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Lenovo Legion Pro 5 has an excellent keyboard with plenty of key travel and a snappy, decisive bottoming action that rewards each keystroke with firm tactile feedback. It beats peers such as the Acer Predator Helios 300 and MSI Katana/Sword, which, while not terrible, feel lackluster in comparison. The Legion Pro 5 even has an edge over most professional laptops including the MacBook Pro 16 and Dell XPS 15.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A numpad is included and shifts the keyboard off-center, a layout decision I dislike. The touchpad follows suit, also veering off-center to align with the keyboard, which eats into the palmrest space on the laptop&rsquo;s left side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The keyboard is backlit and offers RGB color customization across 4 zones, which is par for the course in this category. The software might throw users for a loop, as it&rsquo;s tucked away in Lenovo&rsquo;s Vantage software that has grown bloated over the last few years. Still, the backlight does its job and can look as reserved or garish as you&rsquo;d like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The touchpad measures a respectable 4.5 inches wide and 3 inches deep&mdash;not huge for a 16-inch laptop, but serviceable. It offers a smooth, responsive surface, and Windows 11 multi-touch gestures are a breeze to use. I experienced a few palm rejection snafus that led to some unwanted mouse clicks, but these weren&rsquo;t frequent enough to cause serious concern.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"lenovo-legion-5-pro-display-audio\">Lenovo Legion 5 Pro: Display, audio</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Lenovo Legion display\" class=\"wp-image-1921270\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/784A1127.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Lenovo Legion 5 Pro sports a 2560&times;1600 IPS display that refreshes at a brisk 165Hz. These are common specifications in the mid-range gaming laptop arena, and it&rsquo;s rare to see any gaming laptop below $2,000 with a significantly higher resolution or refresh rate. More expensive gaming laptops, like the Razer Blade, put their increased budget to good use with OLED or Mini-LED panels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maximum brightness comes in at an eye-catching 419 nits which, combined with the display&rsquo;s matte coat, makes the display comfortable to view in bright rooms. The contrast ratio is rather modest, however, with a maximum measured contrast of just 890:1. That&rsquo;s low even for a mid-range gaming laptop and leads to disappointing shadow detail in dark scenes. Darker games, like <em>Resident Evil 4</em> or <em>Diablo IV</em>, look hazy and flat on this monitor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bright, colorful games fare better. The display&rsquo;s color gamut spans 99 percent of sRGB and 79 percent of DCI-P3. These results are behind the best laptops: <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1801763/razer-blade-16-review.html\">Razer&rsquo;s Blade 16</a> with Mini-LED display, for example, can achieve 100 percent of both color gamuts. However, the Legion 5 Pro&rsquo;s results greatly exceed budget alternatives like the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1531369/msi-sword-15-a12ue-review.html\">MSI Sword</a>, which only managed 70 percent of the sRGB color gamut. The Legion 5 Pro is remarkably accurate, too. Color accuracy, color temperature, and gamma results are spot-on their targets, which means games look as their creators intended.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 165Hz refresh rate ensures fluid, clear motion and provides a responsive gaming experience. However, the Legion 5 Pro doesn&rsquo;t gain any ground here, as displays with similar refresh rates are the norm across budget and mid-range gaming laptops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lenovo offers an upgraded display option with the same 2,560 x 1,600 resolution, improved brightness, and a 240Hz refresh rate. I wasn&rsquo;t able to test the display, but my experience with other laptops that boast similar display specifications leads me to expect it will look noticeably better in most games. Lenovo charges a mere $30 for the upgrade, so I highly recommend opting for the 240Hz panel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Legion 5 Pro&rsquo;s downward-firing speakers produce decent audio, though their location means audio can be muffled depending on the surface the laptop is placed on. The speakers strike a balance between lows and highs and rarely sound muddy. Maximum volume is a bit low, however, so the speakers are most enjoyable in a quiet room.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"lenovo-legion-5-pro-webcam-microphone-biometrics\">Lenovo Legion 5 Pro: Webcam, microphone, biometrics</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Lenovo Legion 5 Pro has a 1080p webcam. It&rsquo;s a nice upgrade over the 720p webcams that are more common in modern gaming laptops. The image looks sharp in good lighting and provides a pleasant, colorful look. Significant noise creeps into the video and introduces a grainy, soft look in poorly lit rooms, but the problem is less noticeable than with most laptops. An electronic privacy shutter with a physical switch is included, too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A dual-array microphone handles the laptop&rsquo;s audio capture. It works as expected, providing strong, clear audio capture with good noise cancellation, but captured audio sounds hollow and distant when played back through a decent pair of headphones. This is typical for a laptop and shouldn&rsquo;t cause a problem in video calls.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biometric login is not supported, which is typical for a gaming laptop. Even the most expensive laptops sometimes omit this feature, though it can be found on alternatives like the Razer Blade 16.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"lenovo-legion-5-pro-connectivity\">Lenovo Legion 5 Pro: Connectivity</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Lenovo Legion connectivity\" class=\"wp-image-1921272\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/784A1122.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Lenovo&rsquo;s Legion 5 Pro scores high marks in connectivity. The highlight is a USB-C port with DisplayPort Alternate Mode and up to 140 watts of Power Delivery. This is not enough to fully power the laptop at maximum load, as it ships with a 300 watt power adapter, but enough to power and charge the laptop in less demanding tasks. Owners have the option of leaving the 300 watt power brick at home when the Legion 5 Pro&rsquo;s maximum performance potential isn&rsquo;t required.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional USB connectivity spans a second USB-C port, which supports DisplayPort but not Power Delivery, and three USB-A ports. That&rsquo;s a total of five USB ports, which is excellent for any laptop sold in 2023. They&rsquo;re joined by an HDMI 2.1 port, Ethernet port, and 3.5mm combo audio jack. Most ports are on the rear of the laptop, instead of the sides, which makes for easy cable management when the laptop is on a desk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wireless connectivity includes Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.1, which is standard for most modern gaming laptops. Wi-Fi performance is quite good when connected to a Wi-Fi 6 or Wi-Fi 6E router and will leave many gamers without a need to connect to wired Ethernet, though it&rsquo;s there if you want it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"lenovo-legion-5-pro-performance\">Lenovo Legion 5 Pro: Performance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Lenovo Legion 5 Pro has muscular mid-range specifications which include an Intel Core i7-13700HX processor with a total of 16 processor cores (eight Performance-cores and eight Efficient-cores) and a maximum clock speed of 5GHz. It&rsquo;s paired with 16GB of DDR5 memory and a 512GB solid state drive. The Core i7-13700HX is the quickest processor available in the Legion 5 Pro, but Lenovo offers RAM upgrades up to 32GB and storage upgrades up to 1TB.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Lenovo Legion PCMark\" class=\"wp-image-1921277\" height=\"754\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/lenovo-legion-5-pro-2023-pcmark.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Lenovo starts off strong with a PCMark 10 score of 7349. Though hardly record-setting, it&rsquo;s a respectable score that is towards the top end of mid-range gaming laptops, and it represents a system that is capable of strong overall performance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Lenovo Legion Cinebench\" class=\"wp-image-1921279\" height=\"746\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/lenovo-legion-5-pro-2023-cinebench-r15.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Cinebench R15 paints the Legion 5 Pro in an even better light with a score of 3213. This is a big improvement over last year&rsquo;s Legion 5 with Intel Core i7-12700H, and extremely competitive with other performance laptops. <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1809571/asus-rog-strix-g18-review.html\">Asus&rsquo; ROG Strix G18</a> is the only machine that leaps ahead, which is to be expected, as it equips a much more powerful Core i9-13980HX processor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Lenovo Legion Handbrake\" class=\"wp-image-1921282\" height=\"756\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/lenovo-legion-5-pro-2023-handbrake.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Handbrake removes any shadow of doubt about the Legion 5 Pro&rsquo;s processor performance. It once again achieves the second-best score and provides a major lift over last year&rsquo;s model. Those who depend on apps that require significant CPU horsepower will be extremely pleased.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a gaming laptop, however, and excellent processor results don&rsquo;t always translate to great game performance. There&rsquo;s reason to be suspicious, too, as the laptop I tested had Nvidia RTX 4060 mobile graphics. It&rsquo;s a respectable budget option, but can it really deliver in the most demanding 3D games?</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Lenovo Legion TimeSpy\" class=\"wp-image-1921285\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/lenovo-legion-5-pro-2023-3dmark.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>3DMark&rsquo;s Time Spy benchmark is good news for the Legion 5 Pro, hitting a combined score of 8967. That&rsquo;s extremely competitive with similarly priced laptops and indicates that the Legion 5 Pro can handle most modern 3D titles. However, the new Legion 5 Pro with RTX 4060 is only a tad quicker than the old model with RTX 3060.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Lenovo Legion Shadow of the Tomb Raider\" class=\"wp-image-1921291\" height=\"809\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/lenovo-legion-5-pro-2023-shadow-of-the-tomb-raider.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> hits an impressive average of 130 frames per second. That&rsquo;s a solid score for a mid-range gaming laptop and marks a more significant improvement over the older Legion model with RTX 3060.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Lenovo Legion Metro Exodus\" class=\"wp-image-1921292\" height=\"748\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/lenovo-legion-5-pro-2023-metro-exodus.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Metro Exodus</em>, on the other hand, averaged a disappointing 37 frames per second. That&rsquo;s not an unusual score for laptops in this price range (in fact, it&rsquo;s rather strong), but it basically ties the old Legion with RTX 3060. This would seem to suggest the RTX 3060 and RTX 4060 face a similar performance bottleneck in this game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I used <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> to judge the Legion 5 Pro&rsquo;s ray tracing performance. The game averaged 80 frames per second at 1080p and Ultra detail. That plummeted to just 26 FPS with ray-tracing on and set to Ultra. Fortunately, Nvidia&rsquo;s DLSS with DLSS 3 Frame Generation restored most of that loss, kicking the average back up to a highly playable 74 FPS. Even <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>&rsquo;s new Overdrive mode is playable, averaging 44 FPS when DLSS is on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"lenovo-legion-5-pro-battery-life\">Lenovo Legion 5 Pro: Battery life</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Lenovo Legion 5 Pro is a powerful mid-range gaming laptop&mdash;and while this is good for performance, it can be a negative for battery life. Lenovo&rsquo;s modest 80 watt-hour battery doesn&rsquo;t inspire confidence, either, and ultimately fails to deliver.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Lenovo Legion 5 battery life\" class=\"wp-image-1922007\" height=\"781\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/lenovo-legion-5-pro-battery-life.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I measured four hours and 12 minutes of battery life in our standard video test loop, which repeats a 4K file of the short film <em>Tears of Steel</em>. Web browsing extended the battery life by a hair to four hours and 19 minutes, which remains unremarkable.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"lenovo-legion-5-pro-should-you-buy-it\">Lenovo Legion 5 Pro: Should you buy it?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Lenovo&rsquo;s Legion 5 Pro remains an easy recommendation. Its robust build, professional exterior, and excellent keyboard set it apart from rivals, and it delivers solid performance for both productivity and gaming. The Legion 5 Pro is a large, heavy laptop, and mediocre battery life makes it a poor travel companion. Still, it&rsquo;s a great choice for gamers who need a fast laptop at a reasonable price.</p>\n\nLaptops</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1919038/lenovo-legion-5-pro-review.html", "date_published": "2023-06-05 10:30:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Save 33% off this top-rated PDF office", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>With the amount of time we spend sending PDF documents to one another in life and business, you would think there&rsquo;d be a better standard solution for editing and collaborating PDFs.
