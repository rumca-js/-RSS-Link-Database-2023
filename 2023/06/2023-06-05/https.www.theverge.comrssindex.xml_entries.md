  <p id="eOPwTY">Apple is introducing Optic ID, its latest biometric security authentication technology and the first from the company to be based on the details of your iris. Optic ID will be used to unlock Apple’s new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/5/23738968/apple-vision-pro-ar-headset-features-specs-price-release-date-wwdc-2023">Vision Pro mixed reality headset</a> that was introduced today at the WWDC 2023 event.</p>
<p id="BipTbE">According to Apple, Optic ID works by analyzing a user’s iris through LED light exposure and then comparing it with an enrolled Optic ID stored on the device’s Secure Enclave. During the WWDC keynote, Apple’s VP of technology development group, Mike Rockwell, said the system could detect iris differences even with identical twins.</p>

As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TX9qSaGXFyg&amp;t=405s">shown during WWDC 2023</a>, you can scan your face using the headset to create a digital “persona” of yourself that will appear during video calls.</p>
<p id="HTNomr">Unlike the cartoony avatars you can make with apps like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/27/23657976/microsoft-teams-avatars-feature-public-preview">Microsoft Teams</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/27/23700723/meta-avatars-body-shapes-hair-clothes-texture-eyes-legs">Meta’s <em>Horizon Worlds</em></a>, it looks like Apple is aiming to create a virtual version of your face that’s accurate to how you really look. In the video Apple showed at WWDC, a user holds the headset in front of their face, allowing the device to scan it with “an advanced encoder-decoder neural network” that Apple says has been trained on a “diverse group of thousands of individuals.”</p>

<p id="QTnkbh">Based on the little bit we’ve seen, it’s a dramatically better-looking device than any other AR or VR headset we’ve seen. The actual headset itself is quite thin, and most of the device’s heft and size is from the fabricky...</p>

It’s designed to be seen from a distance and can display the time with customizable clock faces, Apple Home controls, the weather, music controls, app smart stacks, and other features.

<p id="AMhUPb">Perhaps the biggest new addition to Safari is the ability to create profiles. Now when you’re browsing, you can sandbox your activities separately for things like work and personal browsing. The feature will help keep data and trackers from mixing between each other and help you browse more organized.</p>

  <p id="wr7jOW">Apple offered a preview of iPadOS 17 at WWDC 2023 today. The new tablet software update is set to gain many of the same features of iOS 17, including a handful of new Messages features (like automatic voice note transcriptions), expanded AirDrop capabilities, and smarter autocorrect for text input. </p>
<p id="jVVYz2">The iPad is also catching up to iOS with the ability to personalize the lock screen; this works much the same way that it does on the iPhone. Apple’s software VP Craig Federighi also showcased new interactive widgets that can be placed on the homescreen. iPadOS 17 will also bring over the Health app. And last, the iPad will be able to display Live Activities just like iOS.</p>

<p id="n8Lkpb">Apple has been using “Hey Siri” up until now since the underlying engineering and training work is easier against a two-word trigger phrase. Moving to a single wake word is a significant shift, even if it might seem simple.
