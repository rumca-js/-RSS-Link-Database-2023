Diablo 4 has received its first big patch and it's mostly about balancing the five starting classes that players can choose to take down Lilith and save Sanctuary with. The Diablo 4 Barbarian nerf will probably have some players adjusting their builds, while the Diablo 4 Necromancer buff will have players who favor the undead rejoicing.

Dragons are a returning mythical creature in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Like Breath of the Wild, these ancient spirits have been spotted traveling through the sky, but in much higher locations than were possible in the previous games. In this game, not only will you be able to use Dragon Parts in cooking recipes to increase effectiveness and the duration of buffs, but also greatly boost your attack power by fusing them to your weapons to give them powerful elemental effects not found elsewhere. There is also the addition of a fourth dragon that is much harder to reach than the others.

We’re here to show you the dragon locations, routes, farming techniques, and even how to get to the fourth dragon, the light dragon. Stay tuned for all of our Totk guides, tips, and walkthroughs.

The Bunker reviewed by Leana Hafer on PC, also available on Xbox and PlayStation 4.

The newest Amnesia game proves that smaller, anthology-style episodes within its universe can still bring the tension and the scares. Developer Frictional's bag of tricks is far from exhausted when it comes to getting our hearts pounding and making us carefully consider how to use the limited tools available to us. It's not an unmissable experience, but it definitely sates an appetite for gut-churning horror and moody, bleak storytelling.
