## Joselu hits late winner to send Spain past Italy and into Nations League final

<p>Joselu, the man who waited 14 years for a Spain call-up and then <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/25/joselu-scores-twice-on-long-awaited-debut-to-ease-spain-past-norway">scored twice within three minutes</a> of coming on for his debut, has gone and done it again. Introduced with five minutes left in the semi-final of the Nations League against Italy, his second substitute appearance for the national team at the age of 33, he had only been on the pitch for two of them when his moment came. Picaresque, he called it: lurking near the goalline, a crafty little wave of the boot edged the ball past Gianluigi Donnarumma and the<em> seleccion</em> into Sunday’s final against Croatia.</p><p>Born in Germany, the former Newcastle and Stoke striker – a veteran of 10 different clubs in three different countries who was relegated with Espanyol this season – has some record for Spain: three games played, three goals scored. In the 84th, 85th and 88th minutes. And now, maybe, a winners’ medal on the way, too. “It’s a question of faith,” he said. With the score at 1-1 in Rotterdam and the match heading to extra time, which was the last thing anyone wanted, he decided to hang around the keeper and wait to “see what happened”. What happened was that he became a hero.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/15/spain-italy-nations-league-semi-final-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<ul><li>Verstappen has 40 race wins; Hamilton’s all-time best is 103</li><li>‘Records are there to be broken … he has a long career ahead’</li></ul><p>Lewis Hamilton believes Max Verstappen could eclipse his Formula One record of 103 race wins. The British driver acknowledged that Verstappen and his Red Bull team are in a position to chase down his remarkable tally but said he hoped to be able to further extend his lead, perhaps even at the British Grand Prix at Silverstone in three races time.</p><p>Hamilton was speaking before this weekend’s Canadian Grand Prix, where Verstappen is odds-on to secure his 41<sup>st</sup> victory, matching Ayrton Senna’s wins. When asked if the Dutchman could yet equal or surpass his own record, Hamilton was unequivocal. “He has got a very long career ahead of him so absolutely,” he said. “Records are there to be broken and he has got an amazing team.” However the seven-time champion also insisted he and his Mercedes team would be unstinting in their efforts to return to the top step of the podium.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/15/lewis-hamilton-backs-max-verstappen-to-beat-his-formula-one-race-win-record">Continue reading...</a>

During a sun-drenched buildup at Edgbaston, as players prepped, bar staff loaded up the store rooms like missile silos, and mowers buzzed around the outfield, there has been an abundance of knowing looks and instant smiles, every interaction swiftly followed by theories and predictions. The stage is finally set, the pyrotechnics locked and loaded, and all we need now is that initial spark.</p><p>It comes at 11am on Friday morning when, in front of 25,000 spectators, and hopefully millions watching and listening at home and overseas, the first cherry-ripe ball is sent down – a moment which itself has become part of the 146-year legend. In the past they have sailed past off-stump, flown gallingly wide to second slip, whistled to the rope or clattered into the timber; often it means little, sometimes it sets the tone.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/15/cricket-england-australia-ashes-ultimate-test-greatest-rivals">Continue reading...</a>

<p>His allies have threatened colleagues and the former PM’s statement was venomous. This doesn’t feel over…</p><p>There were surprises afoot on Wednesday – or Privileges-Committee-Publication-Day Eve as we should call it – Nadine Dorries was planning to delay her exit from parliament in order to cause maximum embarrassment for Rishi Sunak, though she is frankly spreading her embarrassment so liberally and gaily that it’s really hard to discern a target more specific than “her entire party”, or at a push “the species”. Sir Bernard Jenkin, meanwhile, had allegedly himself attended a party in December 2020, and should therefore recuse himself from a job that had already finished, according to Boris Johnson and his allies, so desperate that they were dredging up ideas that started, “first, go back in time”.</p><p>On Thursday morning, however, there were no surprises. The former prime minister had <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/40412/documents/197199/default/">lied to parliament</a>, and nobody, anywhere, dropped their marmalade. There had just been so many spoilers: Johnson’s resignation letter at the end of last week, a howling and at times hilarious rebuttal of the lying he was about to be found guilty of; the many attacks on the personal probity of Harriet Harman, committee chair; and last but not least, Johnson’s long history of lying; so ceaseless, so well-documented, that if he hadn’t been lying about the parties, you’d have wondered whether he was feeling OK.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/15/boris-johnson-lied-privileges-committee-report-carnival-crazy-sketch">Continue reading...</a>

The song hit the US airwaves in March with stratospheric impact. Their debut album sold over 8m copies and spawned three No 1 singles; it stayed in the top 10 for the rest of the year. Young fans, predominantly women, screamed along to Rob Pilatus and Fabrice Morvan’s tight choreography and blatant eye candy – long braided hair extensions that swung freely when they danced, come-hither stares, chiseled abs, shoulder pads and spandex shorts, incredible energy and incredibly 80s dance moves.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/15/milli-vanilli-documentary-tribeca-film-festival">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Marvel and DC are going all in on the power of the parallel universe, but the gimmick is already showing signs of wear</p><p>Back in 2013, the comedian Patton Oswalt appeared on an episode of Parks and Recreation, guest-starring as a concerned constituent who hijacks a city council meeting with a “citizen filibuster”. The remarks – entirely improvised by Oswalt, and released by NBC as an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BBhNkywMJY">uncut, nearly nine-minute outtake</a> of breathless elaboration – amounted to an unsolicited pitch for the then-just-announced project that would become Star Wars: The Force Awakens.</p><p>Inspired by news of Disney acquiring Lucasfilm, the perfectly named Garth Blundin imagines an uber-blockbuster that would team the heroes of the galaxy far, far away with the marquee superheroes of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The joke was on Oswalt’s unlikely fantasy scenario – his geeky desire to see the characters from one fictional universe interact with those of another, like action figures from different toy lines mixed and matched on a bedroom floor.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/15/the-flash-movie-multiverse-failure-marvel-dc">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Before having children, I thought travelling with toddlers to Mexico would be a breeze. After considering a cruise, I’m just happy to stay home</p><p>I want to take my family on a holiday somewhere warm, where I don’t have to worry about transport or what to eat or think at all. I want a designated time and place for relaxation. I want to declare my independence at check-in and be carried away slowly on a conveyer belt, draped in a sarong. I would like to be pampered to death on a luxury cruise like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/26/infinite-jest-david-foster-wallace-20th-anniversary-20-things-need-know">David Foster Wallace</a> in his story A Supposedly Fun Thing I’ll Never Do Again. I’m tired enough that the existential despair would be lost on me. Five to seven days of fresh towels and organised fun sounds like paradise.</p><p>My last proper holiday with my partner, Sam, was in 2015, pre-kids. We bicycled through <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2021/mar/08/mexico-city-virtual-tour-film-music-books-food-art">Mexico City</a> and ate pig’s head soup at tiny stalls on street corners. We stayed in a hotel where you could smoke in the elevator and the pool had a 10-metre unsupervised diving board. We finished the trip in a hut on the cliffs of Mazunte, where we slept for eight days in bed, on beaches and in hammocks; waking for mid-morning micheladas and huevos rancheros. In the evenings we would descend the cliff face to the sleepy town, where we ate Argentinian barbecue from an outdoor kitchen crowded with stray dogs, watching the sun set. We slept like we had never slept before or have since; deep and long to the sound of the Pacific Ocean.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/15/holidays-with-fresh-towels-and-organised-fun-i-have-given-up-on-being-an-adventurous-parent">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An improved batting lineup, greater bowling depth and a captain in his prime are aiming higher than retaining the urn</p><p>In the hours and days after the 2019 Ashes in England had finished as a drawn series, the careful wording from the touring country was all about retention. That was the focus of the congratulatory press release from Cricket Australia. Those around the camp who before the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/sep/15/ashes-2019-england-v-australia-fifth-test-day-four-live" title="">fifth Test </a>had talked up victory had to temper it and explain that their primary job had been to hold on to the tiny urn, and that ultimately they were satisfied. “Retain” was pasted in for “win”, with the audible hint of an invisible asterisk.</p><p>Much about the effort was extraordinary. Start with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/sep/17/ashes-2019-guardian-writers-pick-out-their-highs-and-lows-cricket" title="">Steve Smith’s 774 runs</a> despite missing the third Test with concussion, after 16 months out suspended. Only Donald Bradman, Everton Weekes, and Viv Richards have exceeded that series tally without playing more innings. Australia had withstood Jofra Archer’s fiercest to draw at Lord’s, taken a first-innings advantage after enduring the season’s toughest batting conditions at Headingley, lost that match to a once-in-a-lifetime performance, then collected themselves to recover and win in Manchester.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/15/the-ashes-retention-not-enough-as-hungry-australia-seek-to-right-wrongs-of-2019">Continue reading...</a>

## Extreme websites peddle conspiracies, but what about the mainstream outlets that do it too?  | Owen Jones

<p>Addressing the problem will mean taking on some of the most powerful voices in the country</p><p>Would you believe that a fifth of the adult population of Britain have either taken part in anti-vax protests, or are prepared to do so? Or that about 4 million people have attended protests against the introduction of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)? What about the idea that The Light, an anti-vaccine, anti-lockdown newspaper, has about 3 million subscribers, and has at some point been <a href="https://twitter.com/EdmundGriffiths/status/1668547152551849984">distributed</a> by nearly 4 million people?</p><p>You’d be right to be sceptical. It’s unlikely that there are 4 million people with in-depth knowledge about CBDCs. The Light only has 13,000 followers on Facebook. And it seems obvious that millions of people have not taken part in Covid-denial demonstrations, especially as only 6.4% of the population have not received any vaccines. But <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/policy-institute/assets/conspiracy-belief-among-the-uk-public.pdf">new polling research </a>released by King’s College London for a BBC series on conspiracy theories suggests otherwise. The findings are based on an online survey of more than 2,000 British adults, conducted by Savanta, a reputable polling company – although a full breakdown of the polling methods hasn’t been published.</p><p>Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/15/britain-rife-conspiracy-theorists-misinformation-mainstream">Continue reading...</a>

## Extraction 2 review – Chris Hemsworth action sequel most interested in extracting cash

<p>Seemingly dead at the end of the previous movie, Hemsworth returns as the tough guy mercenary with a heart of gold on a mission to save someone from something</p><p>Once again, as if wound up by an enormous key fitted into the space between his shoulder blades, Chris Hemsworth comes lumbering out for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/22/extraction-review-chris-hemsworth-netflix-action-thriller">Netflix’s burgeoning Extraction franchise</a>, his muppety-handsome features scrunched into an expression of determination with a soupçon of sensitivity. Screenwriter Joe Russo and director Sam Hargrave have reunited to extrude another calorific portion of action content from their creative intestines and Hemsworth again plays Tyler Rake, the tough guy mercenary with a heart of gold whom we kind of assumed was dead at the end of the previous movie but turns out to have been just very very unwell.</p><p>Rake’s quasi-corpse is discovered and given remedial attention in an outrageously perfunctory montage at the beginning of this film, there’s a spell in some luxury-private hospital in Dubai and then Tyler is as good as new, flown in to save his ex-wife’s sister and her kids from her abusive Georgian mob-boss husband. (That ex-wife must have some serious cash, incidentally, to bankroll this kind of operation.) His handler Nik (Golshifteh Farahani) is back in the frame, this time doing a lot more actual fighting, including some close-quarters martial arts stuff and stabbing bad guys in the thigh with a little serrated knife – although kicking ass isn’t exactly Farahani’s skillset. Our hero also does a fair bit of dangling off the side of very tall sleek glass towers, although it isn’t in the Tom Cruise league.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/15/extraction-2-review-action-sequel-chris-hemsworth">Continue reading...</a>

<p>French soprano Véronique Gens offered a masterclass in elegance with Austrian airs from Felix Gygli alongside buzzy song-poetry pairings from the festival’s young artists</p><p>On paper, Leeds Lieder has everything a levelling up-minded government might desire. Where else could you hear one of the greatest living exponents of French song back-to-back with the <a href="https://ferrierawards.org.uk/">winner of this year’s Kathleen Ferrier awards</a>, while celebrating the people of Leeds in a dozen newly minted songs performed by up-and-coming young singers? And yet Arts Council England has rejected their latest project funding application – approximately one fifth of the company’s annual budget – leaving director Joseph Middleton and his team, many of whom are volunteers, crowdfunding to ensure next year’s festival can take place.</p><p>As for the art on offer, it’s world-class. UK recitals by <a href="https://outhere-music.com/en/artists/veronique-gens">Véronique Gens</a> are incredibly rare, let alone opportunities to hear the incandescent French soprano in an intimate studio environment. Her ear-ravishing programme was immaculately crafted. Gens’ voice has taken on a mellow, oaky quality as she has matured, though the upper-middle register retains its refulgence. Opening with Gounod’s faux-folk song Où voulez-vous aller? and journeying through nocturnal musings by Chausson and Hahn to floral bouquets by Fauré, this was a masterclass in elegance, restraint and the fine art of communication. A captivatingly playful bond with her accomplished pianist Susan Manoff was the icing on the cake.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/15/leeds-lieder-festival-review-from-inner-city-to-international-world-class-music-making">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(YBNL Nation/Empire)<br /></strong>Less than a year after his debut album, the Afrobeats star’s unstoppable rise continues with another summery melange of fuji, dancehall, deep house and Dire Straits</p><p>‘Oluwa gbe from the slum to the top,” sings <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/16/asake-rising-afrobeat-star-at-centre-of-alleged-brixton-crush">Asake</a> on Awodi, the second track from his second album. It’s a typical Asake lyric, in that it suddenly switches from Yoruba to English in the middle of a sentence, a linguistic tic you could view as a bullish refusal on the part of the 28-year-old Nigerian to water down his music for western audiences. It’s also a line that acts as a neat summation of Asake’s career.</p><p>He has talked about coming from, if not a slum exactly, then “a neighbourhood that is considered dangerous, a neighbourhood where everybody wakes up to hustle for their daily meals”. He released his debut single, <a href="https://youtu.be/GAsQbBh0OE4">Ayeeza</a>, five years ago, but things really took off internationally with Work of Art’s predecessor, Mr Money With the Vibe, in 2022. His ascent was doubtless helped by a co-sign from fellow Afrobeats artist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/04/burna-boy-review-london-stadium-gig-stormzy-j-hus-dave-popcaan">Burna Boy</a>, who appeared on <a href="https://youtu.be/7WU__JQuB8g">a remix of his track Sungba</a>.

<p>Napoli’s manager and players were tremendous, Italian sides impressed on the European stage, but chaos engulfed Juventus</p><p>Three European finalists, but not a single champion. A brilliant season for Italian club football ended in the most agonising way possible, with Roma, Fiorentina and Internazionale each carving out opportunities to win their respective competitions but none able to land a killer blow. Feelings of pride in performance crashed up against the overwhelming emptiness of knowing that, for many players and coaches, such opportunities come but once in a career.</p><p>Does their collective failure paint a bleak picture for Serie A? Don’t be ridiculous. From 2014 to 2016 there were three consecutive years when Italy qualified only two teams to the Champions League group stage – Napoli, Lazio and Roma suffering defeats in the playoff round at a time when the fourth spot had been lost to a dwindling Uefa coefficient. Contrast that with three teams in the quarter-finals this time around.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jun/15/its-the-bandinis-2023-the-complete-serie-a-season-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Replacing my canvas totes with a shopping trolley seemed the sensible thing to do, but I wasn’t sure I was ready to become that person</p><p>As a young man I knew exactly what I needed to roast a chicken: an oven tray and an oven to put it in, salt and pepper, and an uncompromising way with the butter. As an older man, which is to say one in his 50s, I now realise there’s another vital piece of equipment: a shopping trolley. I bought one just a few days ago and I’m not going to lie. It has changed my life.</p><p>Like the shopping trolley, this needs unpacking. I’ve never been very good at meal plans, despite the obvious benefits of gathering ingredients for a week’s cookery in one go. I recognise the value of them, especially if you have a life that makes it impossible to nip to the shops on the fly. I don’t have that sort of life; I have something more akin to a messy sock drawer. Happily, it does allow for a bit of improvisation. The problem is that constantly improvising, trying to be an impulsive, imaginative cook, inspired to make that day’s delightful creation by a mere come-hither purple sentence in a colour supplement about the plumpness of berries, can also be a total ache in the <em>vas deferens</em>. It demands effort. Walking down to the shops is fine; walking back with heaving canvas tote bags of ingredients every other day can make a man very tetchy, that man being me.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/15/shopping-bags-too-heavy-embrace-trolley-jay-rayner">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The actor and former MP, who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/15/glenda-jackson-oscar-winner-and-former-labour-mp-dies-aged-87">has died aged 87</a>, displayed courage and a sharp mind, on stage and in politics</p><p>Glenda Jackson, who has died aged 87, had a career unmatched by any of her contemporaries. From 1957 to 1992 she enjoyed huge success on stage, film (twice winning an Oscar) and television. From 1992 to 2015 she was a Labour MP, first for Hampstead and Highgate and then for the Hampstead and Kilburn constituency, becoming a notably outspoken backbencher. In 2016 she returned to acting as a magnificent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/nov/05/king-lear-review-glenda-jackson-old-vic">King Lear at the Old Vic, London</a>; later, on Broadway, shewon a Tony award for her performance in Edward Albee’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/mar/30/three-tall-women-review-glenda-jackson-broadway-edward-albee">Three Tall Women</a>.</p><p>Born in Birkenhead, Jackson first came to prominence in 1964, in an experimental Peter Brook Theatre of Cruelty season at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (Lamda), during which she was stripped naked, bathed and dressed in a prison uniform to the words of a report on the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/christine-keeler">Christine Keeler </a>case. Jackson went on to join the RSC, playing Charlotte Corday in Brook’s production of Marat/Sade and Ophelia to David Warner’s Hamlet at Stratford. Prophetically, Penelope Gilliatt began her review in the Observer by saying that Jackson was the first Ophelia who should have played Hamlet. “She makes Ophelia,” wrote Gilliatt, “exceptional and electric, with an intelligence that harasses the court and a scornful authority full of Hamlet’s own self-distaste.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/15/glenda-jackson-died-aged-87">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When Kit Vincent was told he had terminal cancer, he decided to shoot his parents and girlfriend during his final years – no matter how uncomfortable it made them. The result is an extraordinarily moving film, which premieres in Sheffield on Friday</p><p>‘I’m like the grim reaper,” says Kit Vincent at the start of Red Herring. He is filming himself in a mirror, appearing ominously behind his girlfriend Isobel’s back. “No one ever wants to talk about death, but I guess that’s what I remind them of.”</p><p>Kit is 24 and has recently been diagnosed with a brain tumour. The prognosis is not great: four to eight years, say the doctors. This means some difficult, emotionally raw conversations need to be had with his family. Hard enough in any situation, but especially tough for Kit’s loved ones because he insists on filming them throughout. Whether it’s questions about end-of-life care, discussions of sperm freezing, or live footage capturing him struggling with seizures, no private moment is spared the glare of Kit’s camera, often to the clear discomfort of those closest to him.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/15/its-ethically-dubious-but-thats-love-the-24-year-old-with-a-brain-tumour-filming-his-familys-reaction">Continue reading...</a>

## Elizabeth Gilbert is pulling a novel set in Russia from publication. That’s unsettling | Francine Prose

<p>The Eat Pray Love author said that she doesn’t want to harm the Ukrainian cause. But that’s not how literature works</p><p>More than 500 people posted negative reviews on the book recommendations website Goodreads, urging Elizabeth Gilbert not to publish The Snow Forest. Like them, I haven’t read her novel. But I do know why her many fans were so distressed. The novel takes place in Siberia during the middle of the last century, and the objections to it have centered around the fact that its Russian setting would cause further pain to Ukrainians caught up in a defensive war against Vladimir Putin’s merciless aggression.</p><p>I met Elizabeth Gilbert once, at a dinner. The impression I got, and one that is sustained by her books – most notably, the immensely popular Eat, Pray, Love – is that of a kindly, thoughtful person who would never want to hurt those who have already suffered so much. According to an explanatory statement she issued, “I do not want to add any harm to a group of people who are continuing to experience grievous and extreme harm.” But while her choice to indefinitely postpone the book’s publication (formerly scheduled for February 2024) may have been made out of empathy, her decision, as well as the public outcry against the novel, was so ill-advised and unwise – for so many reasons – that it’s hard to know quite where to begin.</p><p>Francine Prose is a former president of PEN American Center and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/15/elizabeth-gilbert-the-snow-forest-russia">Continue reading...</a>

She agreed and, knowing the festival was famed for people dressing up, she also brought a range of costumes with her for the weekend.</p><p>On the first day, she dressed up as Beyoncé before going to say hello to the festival-goers in the neighbouring campervans. “One of them was Neo’s husband, who said: ‘My wife loves dressing up too.’” But nothing could have prepared her for Neo’s big entrance.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/15/how-we-met-i-saw-a-beautiful-black-woman-and-we-shared-an-instant-connection">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An expert makes the case for psychedelic therapy, but we should beware the ‘Pollan effect’</p><p>There’s no more powerful mind-altering substance than a book. Five years ago, Michael Pollan wrote <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/22/how-to-change-mind-new-science-psychedelics-michael-pollan-review" title="">How to Change Your Mind</a>, in which he described new research on psychedelic drugs, and how they can heal depression and anxiety while giving people the ultimate mystical experience. He tried the drugs himself, loved them and, thanks to the book’s phenomenal success, millions turned to psychedelics for relief and revelation. It was called “the Pollan effect”.</p><p>These days, psychedelic therapy has been legalised in Australia and the US states of Oregon and Colorado (with California poised to follow suit). Possession of psychedelics has been decriminalised in 20 US cities and municipalities, and the Food and Drug Administration appears to be on the verge of legalising the use of MDMA (ecstasy) and magic mushrooms in psychotherapy. Hundreds of psychedelic startups have launched, and dozens of books have been published. Most have flopped, like most of the startups.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/15/psychedelics-by-david-nutt-review-hope-or-hype">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘His muse was the abyss’: why Cormac McCarthy’s blood-soaked visions will haunt us for ever

<p>From the visionary carnage of Blood Meridian to the snowy desolation of The Road, the late author’s incendiary vision leaves an indelible legacy</p><p>• <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/13/cormac-mccarthy-dead-novelist">Cormac McCarthy, celebrated US novelist, dies aged 89</a></p><p>No modern novelist was as utterly wedded to the apocalyptic sublime as Cormac McCarthy, who has died aged 89 at his home in New Mexico. Throughout a career in fiction that generated 12 novels and two plays and spawned a number of excellent film adaptations, McCarthy’s muse was <em>always</em> the abyss. He wrote about the darkness, violence, horror and chaos he perceived at the core of all creation – not with the hysterical terror of HP Lovecraft, but with an ecstatic lyricism more like that of Muslim mystic-poets rapturously praising their holy-beloved.</p><p>Beginning with The Orchard Keeper, published in 1965 when McCarthy was in his early 30s, and concluding with the late-career diptych of novels The Passenger<em> </em>and Stella Maris<em> </em>that materialised last year after a 15-year break, McCarthy’s fiction was animated by an unrelenting pessimism regarding human nature and our place in the cosmos that puts his work violently at odds with the progressivist optimism that has become orthodoxy to contemporary literary culture. A deranged utterance from his most unforgettable creation, the Luciferian Judge Holden in Blood Meridian – “Whatever in creation exists without my knowledge exists without my consent” – has become a meme-slogan of the internet age, signifier of the ancient ecstatics of excess, carnage and madness, the lust for mayhem and atrocity that persists in the foundations of rationalist enterprise and the bright town squares of the online.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/15/cormac-mccarthy-blood-meridian-the-road">Continue reading...</a>

## Luis Arráez and the quest for baseball’s elusive .400 barrier

<p>The Miami Marlins second baseman’s exceptional season has given him a chance to do something no one has achieved in the majors since 1941</p><p>“Baseball is hard,” Luis Arráez says bluntly. Although the <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/luis-arraez-wins-2022-american-league-batting-title">reigning American League batting champion</a> is having an overall excellent season at the plate, he’s in the middle two-game hitless streak when he speaks with the Guardian. In a testament to the exceptional nature of his year this far, however, the Miami Marlins second baseman is still leading Major League Baseball with .382 batting average, even taking into account his recent micro-slump. By having his batting average hover so close to .400 this far into a season (it was above .400 on 10 June), Arráez is flirting with one of baseball’s most hallowed numbers.</p><p>Every sport has statistical milestones that, although arbitrary in many ways (it’s difficult to objectively defend the notion that scoring 100 runs in cricket is significantly more impressive than 99), nevertheless have a certain magic about them. There’s the four-minute mile and the two-hour marathon. Soccer and ice hockey have their hat tricks, basketball tracks triple-doubles, and recording 100 caps remains shorthand for sustained excellence in international rugby, cricket and football.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/15/luis-arraez-400-season-batting-average-miami-marlins">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Preparing for his first Wales appearance since being diagnosed with cancer, the winger is aiming to give hope to others</p><p>David Brooks walks into a lecture theatre at St Fagans National Museum of History on the outskirts of Cardiff and, back in Wales kit and immersed on camp for the first time since being diagnosed with cancer, it quickly becomes clear he feels there are plenty of chapters still to write and one he is particularly glad to have consigned to the past.</p><p>For Brooks, it is just nice to feel like a footballer again. His outlook on the game and life, he says, have probably flipped and these days the simple things bring more pleasure. “It’s nice to be in a team environment,” he says. “When you’re sat at home by yourself – and I did it for six months – it gets depressing and lonely.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/15/david-brooks-wales-bournemouth-return">Continue reading...</a>

He lies — so blatantly, so naturally, so regularly — that there is no real distinction possible with him, as there is with normal people, between truth and lies.

He always says ‘I can’t remember’ when they remind him and is rarely ‘lying’.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/jun/15/boris-johnson-partygate-privileges-committee-report-conservatives-uk-politics-live">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A multilayered debut shifts between the lives of a mother and daughter, exploring heritage, inheritance and sibling rivalry</p><p>Wiz Wharton’s title comes with a sting in its tail. “Ghost girl” is a literal translation of the Cantonese <em>gwai-</em><em>mui</em>, a term still sometimes used to describe white girls, while “banana” (being yellow on the outside and white inside) refers to westernised Asians.</p><p>Ghost Girl, Banana sets out to confront family secrets forged by intergenerational shame and uprootedness. In 1966 Sook-Yin is forced by her family from Hong Kong to London to train as a nurse and send money home. Her immigrant life is a case study for Murphy’s law – anything that can go wrong will go wrong, and at the worst possible time. Unable to find work, she becomes pregnant and goes on to marry blundering businessman Julian in misplaced hope, and to experience persistent racism.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/15/ghost-girl-banana-by-wiz-wharton-review-a-hong-kong-family-saga">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The more colourful your plate, the more nourishing it will be, too. Here’s how to eat the widest range of veg – while having your most delicious summer ever</p><p>‘Eating the rainbow” is an excellent maxim by which to fill your belly. The easier on the eye your plateful is, the more enjoyable it will be to eat – and the more nourishing, too. All of which is good news for anyone following the advice to eat 30 plants a week for the sake of your gut.</p><p>Nutritionists have long extolled the goodness of what they call phytonutrients: a group of at least 5,000 compounds that are responsible for the colours, flavours and scents of the plants we eat. As Evangeline Mantzioris, a food scientist at the University of South Australia, <a href="https://theconversation.com/were-told-to-eat-a-rainbow-of-fruit-and-vegetables-heres-what-each-colour-does-in-our-body-191337" title="">has shown</a>, carotenoids tend to make things red, orange or yellow and anthocyanins (among others) make things blue and purple. The green in your veg, meanwhile, is due not only to chlorophyll, but also to catechins, phytosterols, nitrates and other chemicals.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/15/eat-the-rainbow-10-spectacular-salads-to-help-you-eat-30-plants-a-week">Continue reading...</a>

<p>While the world becomes drier, profit and pollution are draining our resources. We have to change our approach</p><p>During the summer months in the Oxfordshire town where I live, I go swimming in the nearby 50-metre lido. With my inelegantly slow breaststroke, from time to time I accidentally gulp some of the pool’s opulent, chlorine-clean 5.9m litres of water. Sometimes, I swim while it’s raining, when fewer people brave it, alone in my lane with the strangely comforting feeling of having water above and below me. I stand a bottle of water at the end of the lane, to drink from halfway through my swim. I normally have a shower afterwards, even if I’ve showered that morning. I live a wet, drenched, quenched existence. But, as I discovered, this won’t last. I am living on borrowed time and borrowed water.</p><p>Water stolen from nature, drained from rivers and lakes and returned polluted, allows me to live this way. It will have to stop – not through some altruistic hand-wringing desire to do better, but because even in England this amount of water will soon be unavailable. Like many parts of the world, we are now using more water than we can sustainably supply. As surface water and groundwater levels dwindle year by year, a crisis awaits. It’s simple maths. Demand is outstripping supply.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2023/jun/15/drought-is-on-the-verge-of-becoming-the-next-pandemic">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Netflix’s perversely prescient dystopian drama will once again ruthlessly mine your existential angst. Expect incredible turns from Paapa Essedieu, Salma Hayek and Aaron Paul – even if this isn’t its best season</p><p>In a world in which the creator of the Oculus headset claims to have invented a new virtual reality system – called NerveGear – that kills players for real when they are bumped off in a game, it is clear that Black Mirror has its work increasingly cut out. NerveGear is similar to the premise of Playtest in season five of Charlie Brooker’s tech dystopia magnum opus, in which Amazon is promising to enable Alexa to speak to you in the voices of dead loved ones – see season two’s opener for how that works out – while digital recreations of celebrities a la Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too are becoming increasingly common and China runs a credit scoring system one notch down from the one Bryce Dallas Howard navigates in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/nov/26/as-black-mirror-turns-10-just-how-well-did-it-predict-the-future">Nosedive</a>.
