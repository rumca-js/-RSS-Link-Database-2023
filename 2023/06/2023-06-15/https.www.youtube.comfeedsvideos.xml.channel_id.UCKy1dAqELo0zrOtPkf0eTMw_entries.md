From the producers of Neighbors and the co-screenwriter of Crazy Rich Asians, comes Joy Ride-- a hilarious and unapologetically explicit story of identity and self-discovery centers on four unlikely friends who embark on a once-in-a-lifetime international adventure. When Audrey’s (Ashley Park) business trip to Asia goes sideways, she enlists the aid of Lolo (Sherry Cola), her irreverent, childhood best friend who also happens to be a hot mess; Kat (Stephanie Hsu), her college friend turned Chinese soap star; and Deadeye (Sabrina Wu), Lolo’s eccentric cousin. Their no-holds-barred, epic experience becomes a journey of bonding, friendship, belonging, and wild debauchery that reveals the universal truth of what it means to know and love who you are.

Joy Ride opens in theaters on July 7, 2023.

## Layers of Fear (2023) Review

Layers of Fear reviewed by Tristan Ogilvie on PC. Also available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.

"Layers of Fear serves up a series of atmospheric and often surreal trips through the shattered psyches of some seriously tortured artists. It’s made all the more eye-catching thanks to Unreal Engine 5, and the addition of the flashlight provides some interesting new ways to both interact with your surroundings and mitigate the frustration of the stalker encounters previously suffered in the original games. However, its sleight of hand scare tactics are still all too clearly telegraphed and this predictable formula grew stale long before I reached the end of each of its main story threads. Ultimately Layers of Fear comes across as a largely scare-free 13-hour crawl through a string of mildly creepy hallways as opposed to a truly terrifying trek into darkness."

F1 23 reviewed by Luke Reilly on Xbox Series X. Also available on Xbox One, PlayStation, and PC.

"F1 23 is a far heartier package than F1 22, with 26 tracks, the enjoyable next chapter of the Braking Point story mode that began in F1 2021, and – for players who love to recline back into the couch and race – the best gamepad handling in the series, ever. The racing-focused secondary career mode F1 World is also likely to be a step in the right direction after last year’s F1 Life for some, although it's equally probable its arcade-inspired, loot-based upgrade system will be divisive amongst traditionalists."

## James Gunn Explains How His DCU Will Differ From the MCU - IGN The Fix: Entertainment

With James Gunn stepping into the driver seat at DC Studios, the question a lot of people might have is how does he plan on differentiating his approach to projects from the decades long MCU formula established at Marvel Studios by Kevin Fiege? Well speaking on actor Michael Rosenbaum’s podcast, Inside of You, #JamesGunn answered that very question and elaborated on that question, explaining how each approach secret identities differently. The MCU doesn’t necessarily deal much with secret identities and the duality of having one, save for Spider-Man. He went on to mention how much he’s excited to create true world-building within the #DCU, given how vastly different cities like Gotham and Metropolis are. These aren’t known quantities like cities within the MCU, such as Marvel’s favorite playground, New York. There’s more of a fantasy element within the DCU given its fictional cities and locations. We’ve got Avatar news, an update on Peacemaker season 2, and so much more on today’s fix with Akeem Lawanson.
