Honoring anti-Catholic drag nuns is part of the Dodgers honoring gay people during their Pride night.</p><p>Williams sat down for an interview with Catholic EWTN to explain why it was so important for him to stand up. And unlike <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/toronto-blue-jays-pride-weekend\" target=\"_blank\">some of his peers in major league baseball</a>, he's NOT apologizing for it.</p><h3>So what's with the\u00a0Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence?</h3><br /><p>You may remember the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence from such blog posts last this 2019 classic, \"<a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/another-child-sex-offender-discovered-at-drag-queen-story-time\" target=\"_self\" title=\"view post: ANOTHER Child Sex Offender Discovered at 'Drag Queen Story Time'\">ANOTHER Child Sex Offender Discovered at 'Drag Queen Story Time'</a>.\" The \"Sisters\" <a href=\"https://www.outkick.com/los-angeles-dodgers-lgbtq-pride-night-sisters-perpetual-indulgence-apology-invite/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">frequently dress as Jesus, Mary and other religious figures</a>, and brag about mocking the Stations of the Cross, and even the Eucharist. The Dodgers had uninvited them from Pride Night when it was brought to the team's attention that this is considered offensive to millions of people.</p><p>NOTE: No one complained about the Dodgers having a Pride night. It was just this one group of blasphemous queens.</p><p> After the \"Sisters\" were uninvited, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/los-angeles-dodgers-sisters-indulgence\" target=\"_self\">leftist politicians got involved and the team was forced to bend the knee</a> and invited them back with a full-throated apology. LGBTQ activist bullies demand you support their every kink, or else.</p><h3>What did Trevor Williams say about the\u00a0Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence?</h3><br /><p>\n\tAfter the Dodgers caved to bullies and other anti-Jesus bigots, Williams <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2023/05/30/trevor-williams-deeply-troubled-by-dodgers-pride-night-reversal/\" target=\"_blank\">issued a length statement on Twitter</a> saying \u201cTo invite and honor a group that makes a blatant and deeply offensive mockery of my religion, and the religion of over 4 million people in Los Angeles county alone, undermines the values of respect and inclusivity that should be upheld by any organization.\u201d\n</p><p>\n\tHe doubled down during an EWTN interview.</p><div class=\"twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered\" style=\"display: flex; width: 100%; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"></div> <pre charset=\"utf-8\" class=\"redactor-script-tag\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" style=\"display: none;\"></pre><blockquote>\n\tYou see the horrific videos that were posted of them. You read about what they\u2019re trying to do. There\u2019s things that are deeply offensive to us. It\u2019s a blatant anti-Catholic message that they\u2019re sending, regardless of how much good they\u2019ve been doing in their community.\n</blockquote><p>\n\tWillams also points to the Dodgers' \"Code of Fan Conduct\" which opposes fans yelling things that offend someone's religious beliefs. It appears enforcement of said code depends on who is doing the offending and who is being offended.\n</p><p>Again, because we're lectured about finding common ground, no one caused a noticeable stink that the Dodgers were holding a Pride night. It's Los Angeles in June. The government orders people to celebrate Ls, Gs, Bs, Ts, Qs and so on. The issue is over one -- and only one --  group that was being honored. The common ground would have been the Dodgers finding a way to celebrate gayness without going out of their way to offend the hundreds of millions of people who practice one of the Jesus-based religions.</p><p>The Dodgers instead told the four million Los Angeles Catholics to drop dead. They said they were unable to pay worship to gayness without also celebrating drag queens who mock the crucifixion of Christ. And then the left and the media (but I repeat myself) wpnder why there is backlash across the country from apolitical people who have had enough.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

Where police are on the lookout for criminals <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kathy-hochul-hillary-clinton\" target=\"_blank\">they know will be back out on the street within the hour</a>.

And where, sometimes, you just need to take a squirt. That's what happened in this video where a Transient-American saw a bucket, had to go, and you won't believe what happens next! Unless you've ever been on an NYC subway before. This video is just a Thursday for you.</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201c\"Yo, he's sh*tting in your bucket, bro.\"\\u201d</div> \u2014 Louder with Crowder Dot Com (@Louder with Crowder Dot Com)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LWCnewswire/status/1669347840819347457\">1686838514</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\"Yo, he's sh*tting in your bucket, bro.\"</blockquote><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"5b187\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=26915214&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>It's hard to fault the Transient-American. When you see the look on his face as he's evacuating his bowels, we all know that feeling of relief. It's not like the guy was rude about it. He waited for the subway worker to turn around so he didn't have to watch. Our Transient-American friend deserves points for being a considerate gentleman. If the worker doesn't want people taking a dump in his bucket, he should pay closer attention.</p><p>Seriously though, what do you do if you're the worker? You can't fight the guy. This is New York City. The homeless have more rights than you do as someone who works for a living and contributes to society. You push the guy off the bucket. He complains. You lose your job. Next thing you know, you're the Transient-American pooping in a mop bucket. It's a vicious cycle.</p><p>Unclear in this video is what the camera operator was filming when they <em>happened</em> to catch a homeless guy taking a public dookie. Sometimes you just get lucky. Other times, you slip the homeless guy a twenty-dollar bill and a bottle of schnapps so your video can go viral.

He is pro-gun control and anti-Ron DeSantis.

Also, \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpfZcEjopYE\" target=\"_blank\">The Price</a>\" is the mad notes.</p><p>Unlike leftists, I don't demand total fealty.

There was a time where I 'felt pretty' too. Glad my parents didn't jump to any rash conclusions!\"</p><p>Snider, for his think crime, was uninvited from being the grand marshall in San Francisco's Pride Parade.

And while he maintains he is still an LGBTQ ally, they are wrong about this one thing.</p><blockquote>In an interview with Fox News Digital, the outspoken rock star claimed that allowing kids to make life-altering medical decisions at such a young age is evidence that \"irresponsible parenting is the norm in society.\"<br /><br />\"We\u2019re all making mistakes here but as a parent there are certain things that you come to know, and one thing you come to know is that your kids don\u2019t know everything when they\u2019re in elementary school. They don\u2019t know everything when they\u2019re in junior high school. They don\u2019t know everything when they\u2019re in high school. ... Certainly, the younger you are, the less ability you have to make really the smartest decisions, lifetime decisions.\"<br /></blockquote><p>Kudos to Dee Snider for standing his ground. As we saw with Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Anthony Bass, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/toronto-blue-jays-pride-weekend\" target=\"_blank\">an apology is never enough for these people</a>. Saying that children are NOT equipped to decide on permanently life-altering surgery is not -phobic. It's common sense. It's something normie-Americans all agree on.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

I'm just saying, she is making y'all look silly. The popstar makes it sound like people claim their gender identity just for attention and NOT because of who they claim they feel they are inside. That week.</p><p>The singer of such bangers as \"Cool for the Summer\" and \"Confident\" (I can acknowledge a catchy tune) explained her struggle with pronouns in a recent <a href=\"https://www.revistagq.com/articulo/demi-lovato-entrevista-musica-salud-mental-activismo-lgtb\" target=\"_blank\">GQ interview</a>.</p><p><br /></p><h3>What are Demi Lovato's pronouns?</h3><br /><p>Excellent question. She was born a she/her 1992. In 2021, <a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2021/05/19/demi-lovato-comes-out-as-non-binary/\" target=\"_blank\">they decided they were non-binary</a> and started going by they/them.

It was absolutely exhausting.<br /><br />I just got tired. But for that very reason I know that it is important to continue spreading the word.</blockquote><p>Note, even as a she/her, her/she still struggled with gender-exclusive bathrooms and paperwork. </p><h3>What are Demi Lovato's other issues?</h3><br /><p>Besides pronouns, Lovoto is also into body positivity. Which, like with pronouns, means lecturing people who disagree. The artist freaked out on a <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/demi-lovato-body-positivity-store\" target=\"_blank\">Los Angeles grocery store in 2021</a> for selling sugar-free cookies, accusing them of being \"diet culture vultures.\"  She <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/demi-lovoto-attacks-bodyshaming-taylor-swift-bodyshaming\" target=\"_blank\">attacked Taylor Swift in 2016</a> for hanging out with too many skinny b*tches.</p><p>Lovato is also concerned that aliens in this country are loved and respected. No, not the illegal kind that comes from Mexico. <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/demi-lovato-aliens\" target=\"_blank\">The extraterrestrial kind that comes from outer space</a>. </p><blockquote><em>I really think that if there was anything out there that would want to [be harmful] to us, it would have happened by now. But I think that we have to stop calling them aliens because aliens is a derogatory term for anything. That's why I like to call them ETs!</em></blockquote><h3>Your pronouns sound serious. What else can you tell me about them?</h3><br /><p>\n\tHonestly? This bloke says it best:\n</p><blockquote>\n<em>So when you -- quite uninvited -- declare your pronouns to me, in spite of what you might say, you are not telling me how to address you. You are not telling me how you like to be spoken to. What you're telling me is how I must think about you and how I must speak to everyone else in the world when I refer to you. You might think it's okay to control me in that way. You may think you have a good justification for doing so. But at the very least let's be honest about what you're doing. Because that's how I like to be spoken to.</em>\n</blockquote><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">Based man explains the real reason why a person might want to announce what his or her pronouns are. <br /><br />His explanation is perfect. <a href=\"https://t.co/CJ8jmHSZxU\">pic.twitter.com/CJ8jmHSZxU</a><br />\u2014 Catch Up (@CatchUpFeed) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CatchUpFeed/status/1611172996252684288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 6, 2023</a></blockquote> <p class=\"\">As you are ordered to celebrate everyone on the LGBTQ spectrum this month, if you find yourself in a conversation with Demi Lovato, whatever you do,  we're begging you... please don't refer to her as a they/them.

The congressman was questioning congressional witness Dr. Meredithe McNamara. The professor at the Yale School of Medicine writes extensively about gender-affirming care. You would think she could cite a single peer-reviewed study defending permanently life-altering elective surgery for children.

ALL three find little evidence that letting children chop their breasts off and take puberty blockers has any actual benefit. And in the case of the British Journal, it \"looked at 61 systematic reviews\" and came to the conclusion that -- at best -- there was \"great uncertainty\" about the treatments.</p><p>All the Yale doctor who writes extensively on this had was \"standards of care.\" As Crenshaw said, it was just words. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.
