Peterson and Dr. James Lindsay break down how Marxism evolved from a singular ideology into a genus, spawning many oppressor/oppressed dogmas across modern culture such as equity, critical race theory, and queer theory. They trace these sub-Marxist doctrines back past fundamental narrative into the theological realm, and detail their utility in the acquisition of power. Dr. Peterson and Dr. Lindsay also discuss the Grievance Studies Affair, of which Dr. Lindsay was a co-author and which casts a spotlight on the Marxist capture of our academic and scientific institutions.\n\nAn author, mathematician, and political commentator, Dr. James Lindsay has written eight books spanning a range of subjects including education, postmodern theory, and critical race theory. Dr. Lindsay is the founder of New Discourses, an organization dedicated to shining the light of objective truth in subjective darkness. Dr. Lindsay is the co-author of \u201cCynical Theories: How Activist Scholarship Made Everything about Race, Gender, and Identity\u2015and Why This Harms Everybody\u201d and the author of \u201cRace Marxism,\u201d as well as, \u201cThe Marxification of Education.\u201d Dr. Lindsay has been a featured guest on Fox News, Glenn Beck, Joe Rogan, and NPR, and he has spoken at the Oxford Union and the EU Parliament.\n\n- Sponsors -\n\nMoink: Get FREE bacon in your first Moink order today!\nhttp://www.MoinkBox.com/JBP\n\nElysium: Get $50 off an Index test!
