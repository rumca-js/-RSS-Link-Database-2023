After my experiment with Substack many people have pledged to a paid subscription.\n\nhttps://substack.com/@johninengland?utm_source=user-menu\n\nHowever, I have decided NOT to accept these payments and my Substack will remain free access. This means the pledged money will not be deducted from people\u2019s accounts. I still plan to continue some posts to Substack as time allows. The other factor is that I can still post whole videos directly to Substack.\n\nHowever, for those who would like to contribute to my campbell teaching work, I have created a buy me a coffee account. This money will help in the production of educational materials and support health and development projects in Africa and Asia.\n\nBuy me a coffee ink:\n\nhttps://www.buymeacoffee.com/c3kURKNdND", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL8aC09V3K8", "date_published": "2023-06-15 12:02:49+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}]
