These online apps replicate the collaborative dynamic of a physical whiteboard in an office meeting room but accommodate a hybrid workforce — and each board you create remains accessible and can be added to over time.</p><p>Microsoft Whiteboard is the digital whiteboard app included with the company’s Microsoft 365 suite.
