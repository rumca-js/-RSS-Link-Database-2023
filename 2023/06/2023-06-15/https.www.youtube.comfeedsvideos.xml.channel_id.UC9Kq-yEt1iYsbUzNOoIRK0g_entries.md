Ever since the first Transformers movie became a worldwide phenomenon over fifteen years ago, Paramount has been churning out movies in the franchise every few years. The latest entry into the giant-robots-punching-each other film series is here, starring Anthony Ramos as the latest human-person-down-on-their-luck-who-discovers-a-Transformer.

Transformers: Rise of the Beasts definitely raises some questions. Like why are we barely seeing the beasts when the movie title promises that theyâ€™ll be rising? Does continuity matter at all, or are we just done with that? What kind of Macguffin is everyone after this time? 

To answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to Rise of the Beasts!
