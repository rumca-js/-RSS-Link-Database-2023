It is just a shame she couldn\u2019t be persuaded to return when her political career ended</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/15/glenda-jackson-oscar-winner-and-former-labour-mp-dies-aged-87\">Glenda Jackson, fearless actor and politician, dies aged 87</a></li></ul><p><br />For a brief, intense period in the 70s, Glenda Jackson was the very epitome of bohemian Brit chic in the movies: gamine in a worldly English way, intellectual, liberated and frank but with a capacity for demure naivety. This was a period that gloriously co-existed with her recurring appearances on The Morecambe and Wise Show. Jackson revered Eric and Ernie to the end of her life, because apart from their own value, her guest-spots on their programme led to her being cast in the 1973 Hollywood comedy A Touch of Class, which in turn gave Jackson her second Oscar, the title tacitly describing what this Rada-trained English actor was giving the movie. The first Oscar was for playing Gudrun in Lawrence\u2019s Women in Love, a film which became part of her longstanding association with Ken Russell, a film-maker who respected her distinctive combination of seriousness, playfulness and sexiness.</p><p>Jackson had made an impression in the movies in the late 60s with Peter Brook\u2019s film version of Marat/Sade as Charlotte Corday, the role she had played on the Broadway stage, and also in Peter Medak\u2019s cult item Negatives, opposite Peter McEnery, as the couple who like to fantasise about being the murderer Dr Crippen and his lover Ethel Le Neve. But the Lawrentian drama Women in Love in 1969 took her aura of countercultural daring closer to the mainstream, in which she played the sensual Gudrun, entranced with Gerald Crich, played by that other seductive icon, Oliver Reed. Of course, all women in that film were bound to be upstaged by the sausage-party outrageousness of Oliver Reed and Alan Bates wrestling naked in front of the fire. But Jackson, in her angular poise and hungriness, was the film\u2019s driving force.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/15/fierce-sensual-cerebral-how-glenda-jackson-brought-class-to-cinema\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/15/fierce-sensual-cerebral-how-glenda-jackson-brought-class-to-cinema", "date_published": "2023-06-15 14:03:49+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "\u2018We made horse semen into little shakers\u2019: the quest for music\u2019s most extreme sounds", "description": "<p>From cannabis plants to screaming peacocks, swallowed microphones to babies in utero, musicians are rejecting regular instruments and software-derived sound</p><p>\u2018I didn\u2019t shoot a horse to make this record,\u201d clarifies Matthew Herbert. \u201cI just scoured for sounds of horses being shot and having sex \u2026 although that did get me into slightly dodgy internet territory.\u201d</p><p>The experimental electronic musician and artist may not have slain a horse for his latest record, <a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2023/event/the-horse-matthew-herbert-x-london-contemporary-orchestra\">The Horse</a>, but he did use a skeleton of one. \u201cI found [it] on eBay and it only had a day left,\u201d he recalls. \u201cSo I had to make a decision really quickly whether to go for it.\u201d He went for it. \u201cThen I realised I\u2019ve got a dead horse in the corner of my studio,\u201d he laughs. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the space to assemble it, I didn\u2019t know what I was doing, it smelt a bit, so I left it there for a couple of weeks.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/15/we-made-horse-semen-into-little-shakers-the-quest-for-musics-most-extreme-sounds\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/15/we-made-horse-semen-into-little-shakers-the-quest-for-musics-most-extreme-sounds", "date_published": "2023-06-15 14:00:17+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Fuller\u2019s hails rebound in trade at City pubs as it reveals full-year results", "description": "<p>Boss of pubs group says he is upbeat about coming months after return of office workers and tourists</p><p>The pubs group Fuller, Smith &amp; Turner has hailed a rebound in activity at City bars, saying workers in the Square Mile are making the most of afterwork drinks during the warm weather and \u201cenjoying being back\u201d in the office.</p><p>The fillip in trade came after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/industrial-action\">tube and train strikes</a> cost Fuller\u2019s more than \u00a35m of sales, the company said as it released full-year results.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/15/fullers-rebound-trade-city-pubs-full-year-results\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/15/fullers-rebound-trade-city-pubs-full-year-results", "date_published": "2023-06-15 13:41:19+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Four schools in East Sussex forced to close due to water shortages", "description": "<p>Criticism of South East Water mounts as local people accuse it of failing to invest in infrastructure</p><p>Four schools in East Sussex have been closed because of water shortages across the area as criticism of South East Water mounts.</p><p>The company was communicating with customers in the affected areas by text message, according to some residents in Wadhurst.

The following year, while on loan at Wycombe, he had teammates giggling on the pitch so audacious was some of his body of work.

Eze remembers the days when, while playing for Bruin FC in Bermondsey, southeast London, he and his father would have to weigh up whether attending trials at certain clubs was feasible because of the cost of fuel to get there. His first stop was West Ham. He signed for Arsenal aged nine but tears flowed when he was deemed too small and released by the team he grew up supporting at 13. He played for Fulham until 16 and then joined Reading, who let him go a few months later. Trials at Bristol City, Norwich, Swansea and Sunderland came and went.

As millions are driven from their homes by climate disasters, the extreme right exploits their misery to extend its reach.

We have clustered in the parts of the world with a climate that supports our flourishing, but in many of these places the niche is shrinking. Already, around 600 million people have been stranded in inhospitable conditions by global heating. Current global policies are likely to result in about 2.7C of heating by 2100. On this trajectory, some 2 billion people may be left outside the niche by 2030, and 3.7 billion by 2090. If governments limited heating to their agreed goal of 1.5C, the numbers exposed to extreme heat would be reduced fivefold. But if they abandon their climate policies, this would lead to around 4.4C of heating. In this case, by the end of the century around 5.3 billion people would face conditions that ranged from dangerous to impossible.</p><p>George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist</p><p><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?
