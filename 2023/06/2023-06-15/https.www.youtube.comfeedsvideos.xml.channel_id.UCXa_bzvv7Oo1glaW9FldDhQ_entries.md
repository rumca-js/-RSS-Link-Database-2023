Soulslikes continue to enjoy mainstream popularity with each new release, and the coming months are packed with releases that push the boundaries of this genre. Developer Knight by Light’s FADE is one such game that is looking really promising at the moment. It tells a coming-of-age story of a prince who rises to the occasion and banishes evil from his kingdom. 

The gameplay mostly sticks to the Souls blueprint, but interesting new mechanics like the Duo Companion system and a weapon progression system that rewards experimentation helps FADE stand out from the rest of the crowd. It’s developed using Unreal Engine  and looks great with striking levels of fidelity and particularly gorgeous post-processing effects. The game is currently in early access, and no concrete plans for the final release have been laid out just yet.
