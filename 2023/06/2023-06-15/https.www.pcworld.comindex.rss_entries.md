<p>In Windows 11, Microsoft Teams has long been an app imposed on users, rather than one helpfully offered to them. Ever had a conversation with a friend, only to have a completely random person wander up and join in as if they&rsquo;d been invited to chat all along? The built-in integration of Teams chat into Windows 11&rsquo;s taskbar has always carried that vibe&mdash;you have to make a point of expelling it, otherwise it continues to sit awkwardly among your other shortcut icons. But in the latest Windows Insider Dev preview build, it looks like Microsoft is finally acknowledging how unwanted Teams chat has been.</p>



<p>As announced in a recent <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/06/14/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-23481/&amp;xcust=2-3-1955587-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Windows Insider Blog post</a> (and surfaced by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/microsoft-is-removing-the-integrated-teams-chat-menu-on-windows-11&amp;xcust=2-3-1955587-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Windows Central</a>), a pinned shortcut to Teams will replace the chat flyout, starting with build 23481. The switch should make removing the app from your taskbar much easier&mdash;like all taskbar shortcuts, you&rsquo;ll only need to right-click on it and then choose <em>Unpin</em>. Previously, nuking the chat integration could only be done by wading through your taskbar settings, which took several more steps. The change also eliminates the inconvenience of having to make this swap manually, as users who use Teams&rsquo; meeting feature more than chat have had to do. (Though maybe just let us decide to add the shortcut or not during setup, Microsoft?)</p>



<p>Other updates are rolling out with this new Insider build as well, which also will likely become features available for the general public later this year. They include include Windows Ink improvements, a new Focus Session widget, and the elimination of some folder option settings in File Explorer. Long-time Windows users may want to check out <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/06/14/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-23481/#:~:text=Folder%20Options%20changes%20in%20File%20Explorer&amp;xcust=2-3-1955587-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">those folder option tweaks</a> in particular, as Microsoft describes them as the removal of &ldquo;legacy settings&rdquo; that have &ldquo;been around for ages [and] not being regularly used by people on Windows 11.&rdquo; Insider builds take into account user feedback, so if you have a spare PC, you may want to try out the build and weigh in with your opinion now&mdash;before any final decisions are set in stone. </p>



<p>Especially since we&rsquo;ve seen <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/628743/six-months-in-windows-still-feels-too-half-baked-to-champion.html">how things can shake out</a> for us &ldquo;legacy users&rdquo; in Windows 11.&nbsp;</p>

## Get Guacamelee, a killer Metroidvania beat-em-up, free on Epic Games

<p>Indie gaming is absolutely in love with Metroidvanias, games that feature sprawling maps, exploration enhanced by weapon and power upgrades, and a spooky atmosphere. The developers of <em>Guacamelee </em>said, &ldquo;What if we took all of that, and then made the combat and the story fun, too?&rdquo; If you haven&rsquo;t played it already, <em>Guacamelee </em>and its sequel are both free for the next week on the Epic Games Store. </p>



<p>And you absolutely should play it. I&rsquo;m honestly not a huge fan of Metroidvanias &mdash; I get easily frustrated if there&rsquo;s one tiny spot on the map I need to find to progress, and one extremely specific thing I need to do to unlock it, and there aren&rsquo;t any obvious connections between the two. But <em>Guacamelee </em>solves that problem in the most direct way possible: by letting you beat the crap out of pretty much everything with your bare hands, in a combat system that takes direct inspiration from classic side-scrolling beat-em-ups like <em>Streets of Rage</em> and <em>Double Dragon</em>. </p>

<p>You&rsquo;re Juan, a farmer who gets killed on Dia de los Muertos while your girlfriend gets kidnapped and stashed in another castle in the land of the dead. But luckily a ghostly gal pal gives you a magic luchador mask, which turns you into a muscle-bound wrestler who can switch between the worlds of the living and the living-impaired. You&rsquo;ll have to traverse both to beat up the bad guy and his army of henchmen, rescue your girlfriend, save your village, and generally do the hero thing. </p>



<p><em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/guacamelee-stce-7cdbc8&amp;xcust=2-1-1955105-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Guacamelee</a> </em>mixes fast-paced 2D combat with a focus on throws and combos, with some eye-popping traversal moves that will have you bouncing and shooting around the stage like a wrestling-themed rocket. It also has a wonderfully unique 2D art style inspired by Mexican folk art, and the game is packed with humor and nods to other indie titles. If you&rsquo;re as tired of drab pixel art as I am, you&rsquo;ll find it&rsquo;s a breath of fresh air. The upgraded <em>Super Turbo Championship Edition</em> includes 4-player co-op and extra costumes. </p>



<p><em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/guacamelee-2-ac4977&amp;xcust=2-1-1955105-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Guacamelee 2</a></em> builds on the original with an even bigger world, more powers and movement abilities, extra challenge levels, much-improved graphics, and a greater co-op focus. Both of them are free this week on Epic, and as usual, once you claim them and associate them with your account they stay playable forever. </p>

<p>Smart TVs are the bomb.com. I know that&rsquo;s kind of a blanket statement, but having owned one for a number of years, I can definitely vouch for it. I haven&rsquo;t had cable in a long time, so I rely on various streaming services for my nightly entertainment. My smart TV makes it super easy to access Hulu, Disney +, Netflix, and so on. If you&rsquo;re in the market for a TV with streaming capabilities built in, you&rsquo;re in luck: Amazon&rsquo;s currently selling its <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-43-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B0B3HG269B&amp;xcust=2-1-1954919-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Fire TV (43-inch) for $259.99</a>, which is 30 percent off of the original $369.99.</p>



<p>This 43-inch TV features 4K with HDR 10, which means it&rsquo;s chock-full of vivid, bright pixels. You can also control your TV and compatible soundbar with the Fire TV Alexa Voice Remote. It will launch or find content for you as well as updating you on the latest sports scores. There&rsquo;s also four HDMI inputs, which is perfect for when you want to hook up to your gaming consoles and whatnot. Plus, according to Amazon buyers, it&rsquo;s a great smart TV for the price and it&rsquo;s easy to assemble. </p>



<p>This is a killer price for a 43-inch 4K smart TV. Don&rsquo;t miss out.</p>

## Intel’s new Core CPU branding is official: “i” is out, Ultra is in

<p>Last month we heard that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1805480/intel-may-drop-the-i-from-future-core-cpu-names.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Intel was planning on shaking up the branding</a> for its long-running series of Core i3, i5, i7, and i9 CPUs. Not a huge shake-up &mdash; in fact about as innocuous as things can be, simply dropping a single letter from each one. Today it&rsquo;s official: Starting with Meteor Lake releases later this year, Intel processors will be named either Core 3, 5, 7, 9, (note the lack of the &ldquo;i&rdquo;) or Core Ultra variants thereof. </p>



<p>That&rsquo;s according to a sprawling press release from Intel itself, which also notes that some sub-brand labels like Intel Evo Edition laptops and vPro Enterprise and vPro Essentials devices will retain their current labels. Why change things up now, after more than 15 years of the Core iNumber setup? Aside from general principles like &ldquo;a change is as good as a rest,&rdquo; Intel seems to think that the new AI craze is enough to deserve the distinction. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="intel core sticker new design" class="wp-image-1955087" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/intel-core-sticker-new-design.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Intel</p></div>



<p>&ldquo;Meteor Lake&hellip;will be the first client processor manufactured on the new Intel 4 process node. It&rsquo;s the first client chiplet design enabled by Foveros advanced 3D packaging technology, and it will deliver improved power efficiency and graphics performance. It&rsquo;s also the first Intel client processor to feature a dedicated AI engine: Intel&nbsp;AI Boost,&rdquo; <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-announces-major-brand-update-upcoming-meteor-lake-launch.html#gs.0q835d&amp;xcust=2-1-1954947-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">says the press release</a>.</p>



<p>The new chips will also get a slightly updated visual identity, with some gradient dots added to Intel&rsquo;s typical blue color scheme. &ldquo;Ultra&rdquo; chips, the best and most powerful of their generations, will show that label off <s>front and center</s> bottom and slightly to the left. Intel is also dropping &ldquo;generational branding,&rdquo; labels like &ldquo;13th-generation Core i5.&rdquo; But you can bet that tech press (like PCWorld) and general nerds (also like PCWorld) will probably stick to that moniker, if only for an easy way to differentiate newer designs from older ones. </p>

## The biggest Steam update in years just arrived. Here’s what’s new

<p>Steam is the world&rsquo;s most popular platform for PC games and a bedrock of the industry. But if you compare the Steam of today with, say, the Steam of ten years ago, surprisingly little has changed. Or surprisingly little <em>had</em> changed, because Steam just released one of its biggest updates in recent memory. </p>



<p>Valve has <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/3687931965598906185&amp;xcust=2-1-1954972-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reworked</a> the Steam client from <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/3687931965598906185&amp;xcust=2-1-1954972-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the ground up</a>, including changes to the framework underpinning the entire program. The user interface and in-game overlay were revised, too, and a bunch of new features were added. Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s new after you update Steam.</p>



<p><em>This article was translated from German to English, and originally appeared on pcwelt.de.</em></p>



<h2 class="toc" id="revised-framework-steam-gets-new-guts">Revised framework: Steam gets new guts</h2>



<p>The most important innovation isn&rsquo;t even visible to users: Steam&rsquo;s underlying framework has been revamped. The new Steam framework offers developers an environment to access tools, libraries and more. The improvements are intended to make it easier to share code between the desktop client, Big Picture mode, and Steam Deck. Among other things, this makes it possible to deliver many of the new features to the Steam Deck at the same time as the main client.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<h2 class="toc" id="steams-new-look">Steam&rsquo;s new look</h2>



<p>The change you&rsquo;ll notice first and foremost is the new user interface. Dialogue windows, menus, colors, fonts &ndash; Valve has made numerous changes to Steam&rsquo;s look. The basic structure remains largely the same, but has been given a new coat of paint.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Steam Oberfl&auml;che" class="wp-image-1954445" height="733" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Steam-Oberflaeche.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Same, and yet different. Steam has made many small changes to the user interface.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Valve</p></div>



<h2 class="toc" id="completely-new-in-game-overlay">Completely new in-game overlay</h2>



<p>The in-game overlay has been completely overhauled and has been given a whole new look. A new utility has been added with Notes you can make for games, and a toolbar now provides quick access to all important functions.</p>



<h2 class="toc" id="taking-notes-while-playing">Taking notes while playing</h2>



<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1803279/steams-in-game-overlay-gets-a-ton-of-new-tools.html">Steam&rsquo;s new cloud-based Notes feature</a> mentioned above, you&rsquo;ll be able to create notes while playing a game that you can easily reference in the future, complete with rich text formatting. The notes are saved individually for each game and synchronized with all other PCs (or Steam Decks) you&rsquo;re logged into. You can insert images as well, and create multiple notes per game &ndash; even in offline mode. </p>



<h2 class="toc" id="pinning-overlay-windows">Pinning overlay windows</h2>



<p>You can now pin individual windows from the overlay so that they are visible in your game, even when the overlay is closed, as shown below.  </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Steam-Fenster angeheftet" class="wp-image-1954466" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Overlay-anheften.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Valve</p></div>



<p>This feature is available for notes, guides, discussions, achievements and Steam&rsquo;s built-in web browser. The transparency of the window can be freely adjusted as well. </p>



<h2 class="toc" id="revamped-game-overview-controller-configurator-and-mac-linux-improvements">Revamped game overview, controller configurator, and Mac/Linux improvements</h2>



<p>The game overview in the new Steam overlay offers a lot of information now, such as your playing time in the current game, achievement progress, and popular guides. Improvements have also been made to the controller configurator.</p>



<p>Valve&rsquo;s massive update also helps Mac and Linux users. The revised framework now lets you activate hardware acceleration for the macOS and Linux versions of Steam, reaching parity with the Windows version. Happy gaming!</p>

<h3 id="cyberghost-vpn-in-brief">CyberGhost VPN in brief:</h3>



<ul><li>P2P allowed: Yes</li><li>Simultaneous device connections: 7</li><li>Business location: Romania</li><li>Number of servers: 9,000+</li><li>Number of country locations: 110+</li><li>Cost: $12.99 per month, or $56.94 for a two year subscription</li></ul>



<p>Based in Romania, CyberGhost is owned by its parent company, UK-based security-services conglomerate Kape Technologies. The service itself has seen enormous growth in recent years and is now firmly entrenched as one of the leading VPN providers.</p>



<p>It offers solid VPN features including seven simultaneous device connections, relatively good speeds, and a great server spread. In fact, boasting an absolutely colossal number of servers, sitting at over 9,000, it dwarfs most of its competitors in this area. In the past, we were impressed with CyberGhost and took the service for another spin to see how it stacks up in an increasingly competitive VPN market.</p>

<h2 id="cyberghost-vpn-features-and-services">CyberGhost VPN features and services</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="CyberGhost VPN" class="wp-image-1946207" height="597" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CG-Home-screen.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>CyberGhost&rsquo;s Windows application has a well designed and easy-to-use interface.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Sam Singleton</p></div>



<p>The CyberGhost Windows app has an easy-to-use interface that&rsquo;s pleasantly simple and straightforward. On the left rail you have options for <em>My Account</em> and <em>Settings</em>. To the right of that you have all of the different server options. These include menu items for <em>Favorites</em>, <em>All Servers</em>, <em>For Gaming</em>, <em>For Torrenting</em>, and <em>For Streaming</em> servers.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="CyberGhost VPN" class="wp-image-1946210" height="601" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CG-For-Streaming.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Under the <em>For Streaming</em> section, you can find CyberGhost&rsquo;s recommended servers optimized for each streaming service.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Sam Singleton</p></div>



<p>Many of these server options come from CyberGhost&rsquo;s rather unique legacy as a VPN that offers servers based on use rather than location. While these options are all pretty self-explanatory, the <em>For streaming</em> section is noteworthy. Each server listed in this menu is optimized for a specific service and CyberGhost supports unblocking for more than 35 services. For just the U.S. alone this includes Amazon Prime, Fox, HBO Max, Sling TV, Hulu, PeacockTV, Netflix, and others. When you&rsquo;re going overseas, or you&rsquo;d like to access an overseas service from the U.S., CyberGhost should have you covered.</p>



<p>Under the server menu you&rsquo;ll find <em>Privacy settings</em> and <em>Smart rules. </em>The first has just a few basic features such as preventing DNS leaks, an automatic kill switch option, and a blocker option for domains that are known to serve ads, trackers, and malware.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="CyberGhost VPN" class="wp-image-1946212" height="602" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CG-Smart-Rules.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>CyberGhost VPN offers a few, but not a lot, of options for power users to tweak the VPN.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Sam Singleton</p></div>



<p>While the service doesn&rsquo;t offer a wide variety of tools for power users, the <em>Smart rules </em>section does offer a few areas to tweak. Here you can set launch rules for the app, whitelist certain websites so they bypass the VPN, and also choose if you would like the VPN to automatically connect when you open a specific desktop app.</p>



<p>These are all handy, but other top VPN providers such as <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/398777/nordvpn-review-3.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">NordVPN</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/402413/protonvpn-vpn-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">ProtonVPN</a> offer even more features which can be considerably useful. Things such as double-VPN, multi-hop connections, and traffic routing through the Tor anonymization network are offered by competitors but lacking with CyberGhost.</p>



<p>When you choose an option from the server tabs, you&rsquo;ll find a list of all the servers available, which you can sort alphabetically by name, distance from your home IP address, and any favorite servers you&rsquo;ve chosen. This is where CyberGhost shines. It offers a dizzying number of server locations&mdash;more than 9,000. That&rsquo;s more than pretty much any of the other top VPN companies. The abundance of choice here means you have more options to choose servers that suit your needs whether that be location or speed or something else.</p>



<p>While connected to any of its servers, you&rsquo;re able to clearly see the server&rsquo;s IP address and location, data downloaded and uploaded while connected, the protocol being used, and the time duration of the connection. All of this information is displayed in a very clear and tidy manner. While this may seem like a minor detail, some other VPN providers bury this pertinent information deep down in the settings or side menus.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p> The abundance of choice here means you have more options to choose servers that suit your needs whether that be location or speed or something else.</p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 id="how-is-cyberghost-vpns-performance">How is CyberGhost VPN&rsquo;s performance?</h2>



<p>During our testing we rated connection speeds across CyberGhost&rsquo;s servers in five different countries all around the world and then compared them to our baseline internet speed. CyberGhost server speeds were pretty good, although it didn&rsquo;t fall into <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/616724/fastest-vpn.html">our top five fastest VPNs</a>. Across all locations tested, the speeds averaged just over 47 percent of the base download speed and a much more impressive 95 percent of the base upload speed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That doesn&rsquo;t appear great at first glance, but take those averages with a grain of salt. We saw significantly different speed averages across regions. For example, of the servers we tested, those located in Asia were particularly slow while the European servers we tested were much faster. This may boil down to the likelihood that CyberGhost employs more virtual VPN servers in Asia than in its home continent of Europe, but either way it&rsquo;s something to be aware of if you&rsquo;re traveling or living in these countries.</p>



<p>In regards to streaming, CyberGhost&rsquo;s speeds shouldn&rsquo;t necessarily be a worry. During our testing, even connected to slower servers, most content streamed without a hitch. And not just with the recommended streaming servers, even while using other servers we never came across an issue accessing content on major streaming sites. This is another reason why CyberGhost is a great VPN for those looking to bypass geo-restrictions or stream while out of the country.</p>



<h2 id="cyberghost-vpn-security-and-privacy">CyberGhost VPN security and privacy</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="CyberGhost VPN" class="wp-image-1946216" height="646" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CG-Privacy-Features.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>CyberGhost VPN&rsquo;s privacy and security features.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">CyberGhost</p></div>



<p>CyberGhost uses the industry-standard AES 256-bit encryption, which is currently uncrackable, so you can rest assured that your connections will be safe.</p>



<p>It also provides WireGuard, IKEv2, and OpenVPN protocols. WireGuard will likely be your best bet in most circumstances as it&rsquo;s newer and generally known to be faster and more secure. IKEv2 and OpenVPN protocols are older, but still have their uses. IKEv2, for example, has wide compatibility and is generally a good option should you want to use CyberGhost on your mobile device as well.</p>



<p>As mentioned previously, there is also the option to turn on an automatic kill switch, which will sever your connection to the internet should your VPN drop out for any reason. It&rsquo;s a nice feature to have to ensure your actual address is never revealed should there be VPN issues. During our testing, CyberGhost&rsquo;s kill switch triggered successfully when the VPN lost connection.</p>



<p>As for privacy, CyberGhost lays it all out in its <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.cyberghostvpn.com/en_US/privacypolicy&amp;xcust=2-1-394108-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">privacy policy</a>. The basics are pretty straightforward. Right at the top the company says it doesn&rsquo;t track browsing history or traffic. It also says it doesn&rsquo;t store connection logs or timestamps, your IP address, or session durations.</p>



<p>It does, however, collect data on connection attempts including the time they happened, country of origin, and the CyberGhost software version. It also tracks successful connections. CyberGhost says this information is sent to a third-party who collects the information in aggregate. The company says it uses this information to maintain its service and none of the data collected contains personally identifying features.</p>



<p>To further back up its claim of privacy, CyberGhost had its no-logs policy confirmed via an audit by Deloitte in September of 2022. We always like to see a company that takes steps like this to increase transparency and foster trust among its user base.</p>



<p>When signing up for CyberGhost you&rsquo;ll need to supply an email address and password, and payment is accepted via credit card, GPay, PayPal, or Bitcoin.</p>



<h2 id="is-cyberghost-vpn-worth-it">Is CyberGhost VPN worth it?</h2>



<p>CyberGhost is, as always, a top-notch VPN. This is especially true for the average user who just wants to maintain their privacy and security while browsing online. The service has good enough speeds and the interface is well designed and easy to use. It also supports a wide range of streaming services all over the world, and it ultimately makes the right privacy promises (and backs them up too).</p>



<p>Admittedly, the service does lack some tools such as multi-hop and double VPN that are available through competitors. And if you&rsquo;re a power user who is dead set on optimizing and tweaking your connections then you may want to look elsewhere. But for the vast majority of VPN users, CyberGhost is a VPN service worthy of your hard-earned money.</p>



<p><strong><em>Editor&rsquo;s note</em></strong><em>: Because online services are often iterative, gaining new features and performance improvements over time, this review is subject to change in order to accurately reflect the current state of the service. Any changes to text or our final review verdict will be noted at the top of this article.</em></p>

<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s Surface line has had its ups and downs &mdash; remember the Surface RT? Me neither &mdash; but it&rsquo;s generally well-regarded as solid hardware with some great aesthetics. One thing it hasn&rsquo;t always excelled at is repairability. Microsoft is hoping to change that with its latest offering: repair parts for tablets and laptops coming directly from the source. </p>



<p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/b/surface-repair-parts&amp;xcust=2-1-1954833-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The official Microsoft Store</a> now offers a variety of replacement parts for all of its recent devices. Here&rsquo;s a full list of current models, though not every component for every device is on offer: </p>



<ul><li>Surface Pro 7, 8, and 9</li><li>Surface Pro X</li><li>Surface Go 3</li><li>Surface Laptop 3, 4, and 5</li><li>Surface Laptop Go 2,</li><li>Surface Laptop Studio</li><li>Surface Studio 2+</li></ul>



<p>The parts on offer are focused on the most commonly broken or worn-out components, like screens, batteries, I/O ports, and keyboards. But there are also more advanced components (which require a little more skill to replace), like a full fan and heat pipe assembly. Each store listing comes with links to the relevant repair manual, so all you need to supply is the tools. </p>



<p>Microsoft joins a growing number of electronics makers that are embracing DIY and right-to-repair enthusiasts. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1920726/1920726.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Logitech</a>, Samsung, and Google have all partnered with iFixit to sell repair parts and kits directly to consumers, and <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/834889/apples-self-service-repair-program-comes-to-macbooks.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">even Apple</a> has created a Self Service Repair program that supplies tools and components for some common repairs.

<p>Even simple things like file management can be frustratingly complicated in Windows 10 and Windows 11. </p>



<p>With its nested file system and hundreds of menus, functions, and folders, Windows is a highly complex organism. All your installed applications add yet another layer of headaches. If you want to work quickly and efficiently within Windows, you&rsquo;ll need to optimize it to fit your way of working. Fortunately, Microsoft&rsquo;s operating system is by no means rigid&mdash;on the contrary, it can be quite adaptable. This applies not only to the design, but also to basic operation. </p>



<p>Enter this guide. We&rsquo;ll show you a handful of tricks, hidden functions, and additional software that will make your everyday Windows PC life much easier. For even more ease-of-use help, be sure to check out PCWorld&rsquo;s guides on <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/541452/make-windows-11-look-like-windows-10.html">how to make Windows 11 look like Windows 10</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1796506/how-to-tweak-windows-to-help-your-tired-eyes.html">8 ways to ease eye strain in Windows</a>.</p>



<p><em>This article was translated from German to English, and originally appeared on pcwelt.de.</em></p>



<h2 class="toc" id="organize-your-windows-desktop">Organize your Windows desktop</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Desktop shortcut" class="wp-image-1950063" height="585" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shortcut.png" width="701" /><figcaption><p>For frequently used programs, it&rsquo;s worthwhile to create a shortcut on the desktop. Then you can quickly start the software you are looking for by double-clicking the icon on the Start screen.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Sam Singleton</p></div>



<p>The desktop is not just a colorful palette to display the programs and functions on your computer. Used correctly, it is an effective tool for organizing work.</p>



<p>For example, it&rsquo;s advisable to create links to all applications that you regularly use on the desktop so that they&rsquo;re always easily accessible. You have two options for this. First, you can right-click on a free area of the desktop, select <em>New &gt; Shortcut</em>, browse to the path of the EXE file of the program you want to create a shortcut for, then complete the process by entering a name and clicking on <em>Finish</em>. </p>



<p>This works just fine, but an even easier way exists. Locate the EXE file of the application, right-click on it, and select <em>Show more options </em>[Windows 11 only]<em> &gt; Create shortcut</em>. A message will say that you cannot create a shortcut at this point and asks if you want to create the shortcut on the desktop instead. If you click on <em>Yes</em> it&rsquo;ll create the program icon on the desktop. (The same process works with other files such as documents you&rsquo;re working on.)</p>



<p>Over time, your desktop may fill up with more and more icons. To help keep them in order, you can arrange them into folders. Right-click on a free area of the desktop, select <em>New &gt; Folder</em> and give it a recognizable name (such as &ldquo;browsers,&rdquo; &ldquo;Office programs,&rdquo; or &ldquo;work projects&rdquo;). Now drag the appropriate files into the folder with the mouse. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Desktopok" class="wp-image-1950065" height="350" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DesktopOK.png" width="675" /><figcaption><p>The freeware DesktopOK saves the icon arrangement at different screen resolutions and restores it if necessary. This also works on other computers with a file transfer.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Sam Singleton</p></div>



<p>If you want even more options for tweaking your desktop, a free application called <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://desktopok.en.lo4d.com/windows&amp;xcust=2-1-1936122-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">DesktopOK</a> provides additional possibilities. This freeware lets you save the arrangement of icons on your desktop with just the click of a mouse. If the icons have moved, you can return to your original saved state at any time with DesktopOK. The tool also accommodates different screen resolutions so you can immediately continue working as usual if you <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/811315/best-monitors-2.html">upgrade your monitor</a> or <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/448298/how-to-set-up-two-monitors.html">add a second display</a>. You can even save icon arrangements and load them on other PCs.</p>



<h2 class="toc" id="load-up-the-windows-taskbar">Load up the Windows taskbar</h2>



<p>Another way to make your programs easily accessible by placing them in the taskbar. It&rsquo;s always visible and thus great for quick access. Either drag-and-drop a program link from the desktop or an EXE file from File Explorer onto the bar at the bottom of the screen, or right-click on the program and select <em>Show more options &gt; Pin to taskbar</em> in the context menu.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage right"><figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full is-resized"><img alt="Pin to taskbar" class="wp-image-1950069" height="536" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pin-to-taskbar.png" width="252" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Sam Singleton</p></div>



<p>Unfortunately, adding file shortcuts to the taskbar is not as easy. But a trick can get it to work. Right-click on the file in Explorer and go to <em>Show more options &gt; Create shortcut</em>. Then right-click on the new shortcut and select <em>Properties</em>. In the <em>Destination</em> field, write the word <strong>Explorer</strong> in front of the path, followed by a space. Click on <em>Other icon</em> and select an icon for the file if desired (Windows will insert the Explorer icon by default) and click <em>OK</em>. Finally, right-click the shortcut and go to <em>Pin to taskbar</em>.</p>



<p>Of course, the Start menu is also a suitable area to create links for frequently used applications. To place software onto the Start menu, right-click a program shortcut on the desktop or an EXE file in Explorer and select <em>Show more options &gt; Pin to Start</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Tip:</strong> After clicking on <em>All Apps</em>, Windows presents you with a long list of installed programs in the Start menu. To get to a specific application quickly, click on the letter &ldquo;A&rdquo; at the top and in the next window, then click on the first letter of the desired software&rsquo;s name.</p>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-box-text inline-box">
<h2 class="toc" id="make-windows-easier-to-actually-use">Make Windows easier to actually use</h2>



<p>Windows has an extensive range of functions that make it easier for people with visual impairments to use the operating system (though these options can also greatly help usability on pixel-packed 4K displays). Several of these options are grouped together in the Settings app under <em>Ease of Access</em>. For example, you can activate speech output, which reads out the text in the active window. Under <em>Text size</em> you will find a slider to improve the font display. (Unfortunately, it has no effect on the icon names.)</p>



<p>You can simply enlarge the desktop icons by pressing the Ctrl key while the desktop is active and turning the mouse wheel. The mouse pointer can also be enlarged; you&rsquo;ll find the settings by searching for &ldquo;Change mouse pointer size.&rdquo; That said, the universal tool for reading small, poorly visible text and viewing details is called <em>Magnifier</em>. Make sure that <em>Smooth image and text edges</em> is activated in the options that appear.</p>



<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Color filter" class="wp-image-1950072" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Color-Filter.png?w=1200" /><figcaption><p>For people who have difficulty distinguishing individual colors, Windows offers a range of color filters.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Sam Singleton</p></div>



<p>People who have difficulty distinguishing between individual colors and have a red-green deficiency, for example, will find a way to adjust the Windows display accordingly under <em>Color filters</em>. Under <em>Contrast Designs</em>, on the other hand, you can set the desktop to maximum contrast.</p>



<p>In the <em>Mouse</em> section of the <em>Ease of Access </em>settings, you&rsquo;ll find an option to control the mouse pointer completely via the numeric keypad on your keyboard. Alternatively, in the <em>Keyboard</em> section, you can activate the Windows on-screen keyboard and type using mouse clicks, instead. The <em>Speech </em>section can activate built-in speech control for hands-free operation.</p>



<p>For people with hearing problems, Windows offers to translate system sounds into graphic signals. You can turn on &ldquo;Show audio alerts visually&rdquo; in the <em>Hearing </em>section of the <em>Ease of Access</em> settings.</p>
</div>



<h2 class="toc" id="adapt-file-explorer-for-fast-everyday-work">Adapt File Explorer for fast everyday work</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Windows 11 inline autocomplete" class="wp-image-1952073" height="539" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Auto-complete.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="410" /><figcaption><p>In the browser settings of Windows you will find a hidden option that activates autocomplete for quick folder searches in Explorer.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Foundry</p></div>



<p>Even working with File Explorer can be optimized. To ensure that you immediately land in a frequently used folder after opening Explorer, you need a special shortcut: right-click on the desktop and then on <em>New &gt; Shortcut</em>. Enter the command: <strong>%windir%\explorer.exe C:\Temp</strong> as the path, for example, to open the folder C:_ Temp. (The exact file path can be replaced with the location of your choosing.) Give the shortcut a recognizable name such as &ldquo;Temp Directory&rdquo; and click on <em>Finish</em>. You can now copy this shortcut to the taskbar and the Start menu as described above.</p>



<p>You can also work faster with File Explorer if you switch on the auto-complete function. It&rsquo;s located in a place where you would never expect it&mdash;in the settings of Internet Explorer. Yes, seriously. Although IE is no longer included in Windows 11, the settings still exist and now refer to the more modern Edge browser. One of the options also controls the auto-complete function of Explorer.</p>



<p>Click on the search box in the taskbar, type <strong>inetcpl.cpl</strong> and select result for <em>Control Panel item</em>. This opens the <em>Internet Properties</em> window. Switch to the <em>Advanced</em> tab, set a check mark next to <em>Use inline AutoComplete</em> and confirm with <em>OK</em>. If Explorer was open, close and restart it. Enter the first letter of the desired folder in the input field. The Explorer will now immediately present you with a list of possible folders. By entering additional letters, you can further filter the selection.</p>



<p>File Explorer&rsquo;s search function can also be improved. It already offers dozens of options to search for files and can also search for file contents in Word documents, for example. However, it&rsquo;s slow and awkward to use. The superb <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.voidtools.com/support/everything/&amp;xcust=2-1-1936122-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Everything</a> works considerably faster. This long-beloved freeware does not have a desktop search function, so it cannot look inside files. When searching for file names, however, it delivers suitable results almost immediately, after performing an initial index when you set up the program.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Folder painter" class="wp-image-1950074" height="501" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Folder-painter.png" width="710" /><figcaption><p>Folder Painter offers to color the folders in Explorer with one of 14 colors.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Sam Singleton</p></div>



<p>Moving on, Windows displays (almost) all folders in the same yellow color. Only a few cases, such as the sync folder of OneDrive, use a different-colored symbol. With <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.sordum.org/10124/folder-painter-v1-3/&amp;xcust=2-1-1936122-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Folder Painter</a>, however, you can design a color-coding system for your directories and, for example, mark download directories in red and work folders in blue. This often makes it easier to find the folders you&rsquo;re looking for. Folder Painter is even intelligent enough to automatically display hidden folders in a paler shade. During installation, the tool sets itself in the context menu of File Explorer. If you then right-click on a folder and go to <em>Show more options </em>[Windows 11 only]<em> &gt; Change folder icon</em>, you can choose from among 14 different colors.</p>



<p>Microsoft traditionally relies on the single-window technique for Windows Explorer, which makes copying and moving files unnecessarily cumbersome and confusing. Sure, it&rsquo;s true that you can open another Explorer window without any problems, or use <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1663502/windows-1s-long-awaited-file-explorer-tabs-disappoint.html">Windows 11&rsquo;s new (sadly inadequate) Explorer tabs</a>. But it&rsquo;s better to use third-party tools that feature two windows right from the start, such as <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://doublecmd.sourceforge.io/&amp;xcust=2-1-1936122-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Double Commander</a>. This file manager also offers other helpful functions such as tabs for quickly switching between drives and a viewer for different file types.</p>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-box-text inline-box">
<h2 class="toc" id="activate-more-mouse-functions-with-manufacturer-software">Activate more mouse functions with manufacturer software</h2>



<p>Many modern computer mice have more than just two buttons and a scroll wheel. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/452384/best-gaming-mice.html">Special gaming models</a> offer seven or eight buttons that can be assigned different functions or macros. But <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393679/best-wireless-mouse.html">mice for office workstations</a> also often have four or more buttons. You can assign predefined functions or a key combination to the keys using the driver software provided by the mouse&rsquo;s manufacturer. Using these tools, many Windows can be carried out more quickly and easily.</p>

<p>8GB of VRAM, $399 MSRP. No, this isn&rsquo;t 2020&mdash;it&rsquo;s the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti, launched in the middle of 2023. You&rsquo;d be forgiven for mistaking this for the RTX 3060 Ti.&nbsp;And after seeing how closely it performs to its predecessor, you&rsquo;ll probably be even more confused.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We won&rsquo;t sugar coat it: This GPU has been a disappointment. We gave the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 2 out of 5 stars in our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1925928/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-ti-8gb-review.html#:~:text=The%20GeForce%20RTX%204060%20Ti%208GB%20brings%20Nvidia%27s%20awesome%20DLSS,1440p%20gamers%2C%20unlike%20its%20predecessor.">review</a>, with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1662185/what-is-dlss-3-nvidia-geforce-rtx-ai-feature-explained.html">DLSS 3</a> and lower power draw being a couple of the redeeming factors. The performance is mostly stagnant from last generation, and in an age where 8GB of VRAM is getting crushed in newly released games, it falls short.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To make matters worse, both the RTX 3060 Ti and AMD 6700 XT (which boasts 12GB of VRAM) are still both highly competitive because the 4060 Ti is so disappointing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We will compare the price and availability of all three contenders, reflecting on the value they can provide in a difficult market where costs have soared. Next, we&rsquo;ll evaluate the performance chops of all three: Can the older GPUs really stack up favorably against the new RTX 4060 Ti? Finally, we&rsquo;ll note important features that you should be aware of. GPUs, start your silicon engines!&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="rtx-4060-ti-vs-rtx-3060-ti-vs-amd-6700-xt-price-and-availability">RTX 4060 Ti vs. RTX 3060 Ti vs. AMD 6700 XT: Price and availability&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The Nvidia RTX 4060 Ti has launched in two distinct flavors: A $399 8GB variant, and a $499 16GB version that&rsquo;s coming in July. Availability of the initial launch has been the best you&rsquo;ll find, with ample stock. Even the rarer &ldquo;Founders Edition&rdquo; model can be easily picked up at its MSRP.&nbsp;Gamers seem to be acting in unison in choosing not to purchase this new release.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Nvidia RTX 3060 Ti had a much more turbulent launch, with buyers rarely finding it in stock&mdash;and when they did, rarely at $399. Things have changed, and while the price is still high for this older GPU, it can be easily found for cheaper than the RTX 4060 Ti.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The AMD RX 6700 XT had similar, but not as drastic issues during its own launch. Packing a saucy $479 MSRP, it&rsquo;s now going for well under that, and sometimes very close to $300 where it&rsquo;s still available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>High pricing from last generation still lingers, even with the &ldquo;Great GPU Shortage&rdquo; behind us. That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;ll often find older models, such as the RTX 3060 Ti, not much cheaper than the RTX 4060 Ti in certain retailers. Which should you buy&nbsp; of the three&mdash;if any? The next sections will guide you to a clearer picture. (RTX On meme intensifies.)&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="rtx-4060-ti-vs-rtx-3060-ti-vs-amd-6700-xt-performance">RTX 4060 Ti vs. RTX 3060 Ti vs. AMD 6700 XT: Performance&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Performance is an objective battleground where we can clear up confusion surrounding the Nvidia RTX 4060 Ti. First, let&rsquo;s tackle what is under the hood. 8GB of VRAM, but a much more limited memory bus bandwidth of only 128 bits. This has been the trend with Nvidia GPUs such as the RTX 4070 Ti, RTX 4070, etc.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Nvidia RTX 4060 Ti Vs RTX 3060 Ti vs AMD 6700 XT" class="wp-image-1947098" height="1201" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-05-at-12.27.34-PM.png?w=869" width="869" /><figcaption><p></p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos</p></div>



<p>While Nvidia argues that the effective bandwidth is still sufficient for the RTX 4060 Ti since it packs more L2 cache, gamers will still find scenarios where this bandwidth limit rears its ugly head.</p>



<p>The Nvidia RTX 3060 Ti packed a 256 bit memory bus&mdash;more than even the RTX 4070 Ti has. Of course, the RTX 4060 Ti will have some DLSS 3 secret magic with its optical flow sensors, but that carries with it special caveats. These hardware limitations are why it&rsquo;s possible to see limited or even negative performance gains on the newer RTX 4060 Ti versus the older GPUs in some scenarios (especially at higher resolutions).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Knowing that 8GB of VRAM is not enough in 2023 for many gamers&mdash;even 1080p can see drawbacks&mdash;a 16GB VRAM version cometh soon. The jury is out on if that will make a difference, but we fear that with a $499 price and performance that will usually be identical to the 8GB version, it may not be enough.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We can&rsquo;t mention the RTX 4060 Ti without giving credit to the AMD RX 6700 XT. Packing a generous 12GB of VRAM with a 192-bit memory bus bandwidth, it certainly punches above its weight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let&rsquo;s look at some performance numbers to see how these competitors play out in real-world gaming.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Nvidia RTX 4060 Ti Vs RTX 3060 Ti vs AMD 6700 XT" class="wp-image-1947101" height="160" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1080p.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /><figcaption><p>From PCWorld&rsquo;s RTX 4060 Ti review.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos</p></div>



<p>At 1080p resolution&mdash;the intended use case for the Nvidia RTX 4060 Ti&mdash;we see some interesting numbers. There are some cases where it does pull away as expected, such as the 158.4fps versus the 137.7 of the RTX 3060 Ti. It also pulls away from the RTX 3060 Ti in <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</em>, but the AMD 6700 XT is right up there at 117fps versus the 4060 Ti&rsquo;s 119fps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The back and forth continues, with the RTX 4060 Ti being only a few frames per second better than the RTX 3060 Ti on the &ldquo;total average.&rdquo; The AMD 6700 XT is not far behind, either. When taking the pricing and age of these GPUs into consideration, the RTX 4060 Ti is only a mild improvement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s clear that owners of these two older GPUs should not look to upgrade to the RTX 4060 Ti. It may only make sense for those with much older GPUs.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="RTX 4060 Ti Vs RTX 3060 Ti vs AMD 6700 XT" class="wp-image-1947102" height="195" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1440p.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /><figcaption><p>From PCWorld&rsquo;s RTX 4060 Ti review.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos</p></div>



<p>If you weren&rsquo;t impressed with the RTX 4060 Ti at 1080p, you will surely be disappointed with 1440p performance. Some titles even have the RTX 3060 Ti with a superior lead&mdash;such as <em>Counter Strike: Global Offensive</em>. Even excluding this game, the overall FPS average is a tie of 89fps between the two older GPUs, just short of 96fps of the RTX 4060 Ti. Certainly, almost negligible performance gains over an entire generation.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="RTX 4060 Ti Vs RTX 3060 Ti vs AMD 6700 XT" class="wp-image-1947103" height="180" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/dlss-and-ray-tracing.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /><figcaption><p>From PCWorld&rsquo;s RTX 4060 Ti review.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos</p></div>



<p>Before the RTX 4060 Ti taps out, let&rsquo;s give it an easier time. Ah, DLSS 3 and ray tracing&mdash;now it can breathe easier, right?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since the RTX 3060 Ti doesn&rsquo;t have frame generation in its DLSS flavor, the FPS gains are constrained. Likewise, FSR 2 on the AMD 6700 XT does not jump up much either.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>DLSS 3&mdash;with frame generation on and Nvidia Reflex&mdash;propels the RTX 4060 Ti to much higher FPS, as in the case of 122.5fps in <em>Cyberpunk RT Ultra</em>. The gap in FPS continues with games that support frame generation, such as <em>F1 2022</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There&rsquo;s a problem, however. DLSS 3 is not available on many games&mdash;and even some new releases such as <em>Jedi Survivor</em>, omit DLSS entirely. There&rsquo;s another problem pointed out by Brad Chacos: DLSS 3 simply does not look as promising when starting off at 1080p. It makes great sense at 4K or 1440p, where you still have a high starting resolution to downscale. At 1080p, you&rsquo;re more limited, erasing some of the visual eye candy detail when using ray tracing and such. For that reason, it doesn&rsquo;t make DLSS 3 as effective on the RTX 4060 Ti as you&rsquo;ll find at the upper echelon of Nvidia GPUs where there is more brute force.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In conclusion for performance: The RTX 4060 Ti is not a worthwhile upgrade over either the RTX 3060 Ti or the AMD 6700 XT. While DLSS 3 and ray tracing performance is better, the lower-resolution entry point limits the appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="rtx-4060-ti-vs-rtx-3060-ti-vs-amd-6700-xt-efficiency-and-features">RTX 4060 Ti vs. RTX 3060 Ti vs. AMD 6700 XT: Efficiency and features&nbsp;</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="RTX 4060 Ti Vs RTX 3060 Ti vs AMD 6700 XT" class="wp-image-1947105" height="535" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/power-and-thermals.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /><figcaption><p>From PCWorld&rsquo;s RTX 4060 Ti review.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos</p></div>



<p>This is where the RTX 4060 Ti truly shines&mdash;power efficiency. If looking at its performance through the lens of the power it puts out, this GPU is certainly impressive. Perhaps it is a combination of the new architecture, and some of the limited hardware specs versus the last generation that help it achieve these numbers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A hallmark of DLSS 3 is its ability to aid FPS performance with a lower power draw. This is certainly a feature that&rsquo;s absent on both the RTX 3060 Ti and AMD 6700 XT, which both draw more power on average.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Nvidia-centric features are also a factor when looking at the RTX 4060 Ti. The AV1 encoding capabilities, along with the usual suite of software, such as Nvidia Reflex, help to round it out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, aside from DLSS 3 and perhaps some better performance for content creators, the RTX 4060 Ti really does not offer enough of an improvement for a substantial upgrade. The power efficiency is fantastic, but these GPUs aren&rsquo;t for laptops&mdash;gamers want better performance, VRAM specs, and pricing first.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The RTX 3060 Ti was a popular GPU in its day, with almost-RTX 3070 level performance for $399. In 2023, the release of the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti is a disappointment. 8GB of VRAM is simply not enough in 2023 for any sensible future-proofing&mdash;as many new releases already struggle with the limit. Given that the RTX 4060 Ti is only a marginal improvement over the RTX 3060 Ti, it really shows how the RTX 3060 Ti was a stellar product that aged well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The AMD 6700 XT is the interesting option in the lineup. It comes with a much healthier 12GB of VRAM and performs relatively well in comparison to both the RTX 3060 Ti and RTX 4060 Ti. It can also be found for cheaper than the RTX 4060 Ti. It does have some drawbacks&mdash;mainly higher power draw, no DLSS 3, and worse ray tracing performance compared to Nvidia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, both of these older GPUs have stood the test of time and aged gracefully. The Nvidia RTX 4060 Ti still cannot be recommended&mdash;it just offers too little in the modern age. It would have been more successful as an RTX 4060 or similar-level GPU instead, at a much lower price.</p>
