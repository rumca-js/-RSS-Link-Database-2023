  <p id="nfGtQ6">According to Dish Network, things at Dish are going great. Yesterday marked its second FCC coverage deadline since it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21309968/dish-boost-sprint-tmobile-acquisition-spinoff-closes-prepaid">bought Boost from T-Mobile</a>, and the company <a href="https://ir.dish.com/news-releases/news-release-details/dish-5g-network-now-available-over-70-percent-us-population">issued a press release today</a> stating that it now covers 70 percent of the US population and has “also satisfied all other June 14, 2023 FCC commitments.” It’s not exactly mission accomplished just yet, though.</p>
<p id="MHiHKb">In meeting this FCC milestone, Dish says it has deployed over 15,000 5G cell sites and would like to remind us that it’s still the first wireless provider in the country to launch voice calling over 5G, known as VoNR — Voice over New Radio. </p>
<p id="mDdHO8">This is all well and good, but Dish’s wireless service still doesn’t look quite the same as AT&amp;T’s or Verizon’s. The network itself...</p>

It’s a startling change for many members of the Reddit community, but it’s one that Reddit CEO Steve Huffman tells <em>The Verge</em> that he’s fine with making. Those third-party apps, in his eyes, aren’t adding much value to the platform. </p>
<p id="NYVEcM">“So the vast majority of the uses of the API — not [third-party apps like Apollo for Reddit] — the other 98 percent of them, make tools, bots, enhancements to Reddit. That’s what the API is for,” Huffman says. “It was never designed to support third-party apps.” According to Huffman, he “let it exist,” and “I should take the blame for that because I was the guy...</p>

  <p id="3hvDJa">Microsoft has moved on from the Xbox One and is no longer creating first-party games for its previous generation of consoles. “We’ve moved on to Gen 9,” says Xbox Game Studios chief Matt Booty, referring to the Xbox Series S / X generation, in an <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/06/15/xbox-game-studios-matt-booty">interview with <em>Axios</em></a>.</p>
<p id="i6IiHn">While Microsoft will still support Xbox One hardware and games like <em>Minecraft</em> running on the previous generation, no internal studios are working on new games for the Xbox One anymore.

  <p id="5wNoWi">“Beyond the Sea” is the rarest breed of <em>Black Mirror</em> episode: the kind driven by empathy. Carried by a cast that includes Aaron Paul, Josh Hartnett, and Kate Mara, it’s equal parts character study and <em>Twilight Zone</em> creeping horror — a story focused less on the series’ typical social commentary than on three people whose impossible situation leads to an inevitably tragic end.</p>
<p id="q9Vu0i">The episode is set in an alternate 1969 where two astronauts are midway through a six-year mission. Although their bodies are stuck in a cramped spacecraft, they spend most of their time inhabiting a pair of lifelike telepresence “replicas” on Earth. David (Hartnett) maintains an idyllic life with his wife and two children, taking his Neil Armstrong-esque celebrity...</p>

  <p id="vAHa6C">While <em>Black Mirror</em> started out as a series exploring the myriad terrifying ways technology could impact our lives, it has since grown into a more general genre anthology. It’s nice when episodes have that techno focus, but it’s no longer a necessity. Case in point: “Demon 79,” a season 6 story that’s pure classic horror homage. Its premise wouldn’t be out of place in a collection like <em>Tales From the Crypt</em> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23416797/netflix-guillermo-del-toro-cabinet-of-curiosities-review"><em>Cabinet of Curiosities</em></a>. But don’t let the lack of <em>Black Mirror</em>-ness dissuade you — this episode is a blast of Hitchcockian scares with just the right kind of twist.</p>
<p id="mJYHP7">“Demon 79” — which was directed by Toby Haynes and written by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23141670/ms-marvel-review"><em>Ms. Marvel</em></a>’s Bisha K. Ali and <em>Black Mirror</em> creator Charlie Brooker — is centered on Nida (Anjana Vasan), a...</p>

  <p id="ciLctG">President Joe Biden is set to announce that ticketing giants Live Nation and Ticketmaster have promised to disclose the full price of tickets upfront, essentially removing the haunting prospect of hidden fees at checkout, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/ticketmaster-live-nation-agree-all-in-prices-part-biden-war-junk-fees-2023-06-15/">according to <em>Reuters</em></a>. </p>
<p id="rgKnqd">Live Nation and Ticketmaster have been the focus of regulatory ire for years, but scrutiny hit a fever pitch last November when Live Nation canceled ticket sales for Taylor Swift’s The Eras Tour. While the Swift cancellations were <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/24/23569622/taylor-swift-eras-ticketmaster-live-nation-klobuchar-antitrust-hearing">reportedly due to a bot attack</a>, the event became the focus of critics who argue that Live Nation drives up ticketing costs and fees for customers by entering into anti-competitive contracts with venues. </p>

  <p id="gBKnF0">Google Lens is now able to offer more information on that pesky rash that you’re not sure whether to worry about. In a <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-lens/google-lens-features/">blog post published this week</a>, Google outlined how the Lens image search feature built into its apps on iOS and Android can “search for skin conditions” like an “odd mole or rash.” It’ll also work on other parts of your body if you want more information about a bump on your lip, line on a nail, or hair loss from your scalp. </p>
<p id="fPxD1s">“Just take a picture or upload a photo through Lens, and you’ll find visual matches to inform your search,” the blog post reads. Crucially, however, Google specifically warns that results are “informational only and not a diagnosis” and says users should “consult your medical authority for advice.” </p>

  <p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ojjV8R">There is a certain flavor of tech nerd that needs direct, unadulterated access to whatever they are working with. Most of these people are Linux users, can own several Raspberry Pis, can’t stand it when something comes in between them and their hardware, and will take whatever complex path they need to interface directly with it. I am one of these people, and I am only getting worse over time, which is why I have converted my smart home to <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a>, the home automation solution for true freaks.</p>

## Google’s EU launch of AI chatbot Bard delayed by privacy concerns

<p id="gcEpyr">This is due to Google failing to answer privacy concerns from the Irish Data Protection Commission or DPC — the regulator for Google’s Dublin-based EU operations.</p>
<p id="6lVGqq">As first reported by <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/google-postpone-bard-chatbot-eu-launch-privacy-concern/"><em>Politico</em></a>, the DPC’s deputy commissioner, Graham Doyle, said Google “recently” informed the organization of an upcoming Bard launch in the EU. The DPC asked for a “<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-35-gdpr/">data protection impact assessment</a>,” which is required under EU privacy laws. Google didn’t provide the docs, the DPC asked more questions, and Google has yet to respond. As a result, says Doyle, “Bard will not now launch this week.” </p>

  <p id="aE1wzF">Microsoft is preparing to remove its built-in Microsoft Teams client in Windows 11 nearly two years after the integration was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548738/microsoft-teams-windows-11-integration-announcement-features">first announced</a>. The Chat functionality will be replaced with the more flexible free version of Microsoft Teams that’s also available as an app for Windows 10. Microsoft announced the changes in a new Windows 11 test build this week.</p>
<p id="sQLpZX">“Starting with his build, Chat is now Microsoft Teams – Free,” says Brandon LeBlanc, senior program manager at Microsoft, <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/06/14/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-23481/">in a blog post</a>. “Microsoft Teams – Free is pinned by default to the taskbar and can be unpinned like other apps on the taskbar.” We asked Microsoft to comment on why Chat is being removed, but the company hasn’t responded in time for publication.</p>

  <p id="NOANcU">Are you still hanging on to that giant 8TB spinning HDD for your PC game installs? Well, it’s starting to look like SSDs will become the new minimum spec for modern PC games. While SSDs have shipped as standard in the latest and greatest PC gaming rigs and laptops, we haven’t seen game developers really push for SSDs as a minimum... until this week.</p>
<p id="NhmXie">Microsoft held its Xbox Games Showcase on Sunday and revealed that Bethesda’s first new IP in 25 years, <em>Starfield</em>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1716740/STARFIELD/">will require</a> 125GB of SSD storage when it debuts on September 6th. It’s not a recommendation — it’s a minimum spec to play <em>Starfield </em>on a PC.</p>

  <p id="GJvDLy">The National Music Publishers' Association (NMPA) is suing Twitter on behalf of 17 music publishers representing the biggest artists in the business. The <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23848155-music-industry-v-twitter">lawsuit</a>, filed in federal court in Tennessee, claims the company "fuels its business with countless infringing copies of musical compositions, violating Publishers' and others' exclusive rights under copyright law." </p>
<p id="v9bi5g">It also has <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23848156-1700-songs-twitters-getting-sued-for">a list of 1,700 or so songs</a> (included below) that the publishers say have been included in multiple copyright notices to Twitter without the company doing anything about it, asking the court to fine Twitter up to $150,000 for each violation. </p>
<p id="2delU1">The issue predates Musk's $44 billion purchase of Twitter last year. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/14/technology/music-twitter-lawsuit-elon-musk.html"><em>New York Times</em></a> cites unnamed employees saying...</p>
