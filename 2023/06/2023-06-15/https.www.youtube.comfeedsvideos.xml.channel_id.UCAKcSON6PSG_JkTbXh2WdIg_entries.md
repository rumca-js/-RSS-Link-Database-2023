While on tour across the United States, U.K. band The Heavy Heavy were living a real-life version of their hit song ‘Miles and Miles’ when they visited The Current studio for a session hosted by Ayisha Jaffer.

Blending elements of ‘60s folk, cosmic Americana and good-old rock and roll, The Heavy Heavy performed a lively set in the studio, after which The Heavy Heavy’s Georgie Fuller and Will Turner sat down for an equally lively conversation with Ayisha about their EP 'Life and Life Only,' out now on @atorecords. Watch the full conversation above.
