Just a bit of an update from John. After my experiment with Substack many people have pledged to a paid subscription.

However, I have decided NOT to accept these payments and my Substack will remain free access. This means the pledged money will not be deducted from peopleâ€™s accounts. I still plan to continue some posts to Substack as time allows. The other factor is that I can still post whole videos directly to Substack.

However, for those who would like to contribute to my campbell teaching work, I have created a buy me a coffee account. This money will help in the production of educational materials and support health and development projects in Africa and Asia.
