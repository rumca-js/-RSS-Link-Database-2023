<p>After years of development, Virgin Galactic is finally ready to take <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-reopens-ticket-sales-073418808.html">paying customers</a>. The company has <a href="https://www.virgingalactic.com/news/virgin-galactic-announces-start-of-commercial-spaceflight-service">confirmed</a> that its first commercial spaceflight, Galactic 01, will launch between June 27th and June 30th. This inaugural mission will carry three people from Italy's Air Force and National Research Council as they conduct microgravity research. Virgin had anticipated a late June start, but hadn't committed to that window until now.</p><p>The company already has follow-up flights scheduled. Galactic 02 is expected to launch in early August and will carry a private crew. Virgin will fly on a monthly basis afterward, although details of future missions aren't yet available. At least the first two flights will stream live through the company's website.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Virgin conducted its last pre-commercial flight test, its fifth spaceflight of any kind, in late May. The company faced numerous delays and incidents getting to that point, however. The company completed its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-09-05-virgin-galactic-spaceshiptwo-completes-second-test-flight.html">first SpaceShipTwo test flights</a> in 2013, but paused its efforts after the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-07-28-ntsb-spaceshiptwo-crash-findings.html">deadly 2014 crash</a> of VSS Enterprise.  Flight testing didn't resume until VSS Unity's glide test at the end of 2016. The firm finally <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-13-virgin-galactic-spaceshiptwo-reaches-space.html">reached space</a> in 2018, but had to wait until 2021 to complete its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-richard-branson-spaceflight-complete-154012847.html">first fully crewed spacefligh</a>t with founder Richard Branson aboard. It pushed back commercial service <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-again-delays-space-tourism-flights-to-second-quarter-2023-084540843.html">multiple times</a> due to varying factors, most recently delays in upgrading the VMS Eve &quot;mothership&quot; that carries SpaceShipTwo vehicles to their launch altitude.</p><p>The debut is important for Virgin's business. Virgin has operated at a loss for years, losing more than $500 million just in 2022. Commercial service won't recoup those investments quickly even at $450,000 per ticket, but it will give the company a significant source of revenue.</p><p>This isn't the start of space tourism for Virgin. In that sense, it's still trailing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-completes-first-crewed-spaceflight-132937714.html">Blue Origin</a>. Galactic 01 will put Virgin ahead of SpaceX, though, as that company's Starship rocket has yet to reach space and isn't expected to launch its first lunar tourist flights until late 2024 at the earliest. While Virgin is less ambitious than Elon Musk's operation, it's also achieving its goals sooner.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-will-start-commercial-spaceflight-as-soon-as-june-27th-214515616.html?src=rss

## UDO details Super Gemini synthesizer, a 20-voice beast perfect for sound design

<p>British instrument manufacturer Unidentified Dancing Objects (UDO) <a href="https://www.udo-audio.com/super-gemini"><ins>has released pricing and availability information</ins></a> for its upcoming Super Gemini synthesizer after first teasing the device at Superbooth 2023. The Super Gemini is an absolute beast, with 20 voices, dual-layer polyphony, and a bi-timbral analog hybrid sound engine. This means you can play 20 notes at once, but the dual-layer polyphony lets you combine sounds, making ten “super” voices that deliver unique sound design combinations to the left and right stereo channels.</p><p>If you’re thinking this is a fantastic option for comprehensive sound design, well that’s the point. The stereo binaural signal path is equipped with effects processors, gate arrays and pedal connectors to allow for “glittering frequency” and “shattering harmonics”, with the company boasting that the instrument is great for creating both familiar and discordant soundscapes. There’s 256 performance and patch slots and a whopping 64 interchangeable waveforms to start your sound design journey. Sound design options include wave morphing, cross mod features, bi-directional sync and, of course, an all-analog signal path.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="67288976d16542dbbdf2da89e6559893"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0;"></div></div><p>The sequencer stores 16 editable patterns and the exterior is equipped with dual control schemes that let you simultaneously sculpt sounds across both channels. The Super Gemini is sturdy with an exterior built from aluminum and steel, with UDO noting that the knobs and levers received the same attention to detail. The 61-note keybed is semi-weighted and boasts polyphonic aftertouch and the custom-engineered panel includes a ribbon controller for individual note articulation.</p><p>The Super Gemini follows the company’s well-received Super 6 synth, though improves upon it in nearly every way. The only downside here? This is a professional synth with high-grade components, so it’s gonna cost you. UDO’s Super Gemini costs $4,200 and preorders are available now at various music retailers, though it won’t ship until October.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/udo-details-super-gemini-synthesizer-a-20-voice-beast-perfect-for-sound-design-184500613.html?src=rss

## Rockstar Games co-founder Dan Houser has a new studio

<p>Rockstar Games co-founder and former creative director Dan Houser has a new company. <a href="https://www.absurdventures.com">Absurd Ventures</a> says it will build stories, characters and worlds across different mediums — including but not limited to video games. The 49-year-old <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-04-rockstar-games-co-founder-dan-houser-leaves.html">left Rockstar Games</a> in 2020.</p><p>“Storytelling. Philanthropy. Ultraviolence.” That’s the tagline for Absurd Ventures, which launches with the two-minute video below that shows more than it tells about the company’s creative, abstract and edgy vibe. However, a press release does <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1669384482443362334">provide</a> a more tangible description, describing Absurd as “building narrative worlds, creating characters, and writing stories for a diverse variety of genres, without regard to medium, to be produced for live-action and animation; video games and other interactive content; books, graphic novels, and scripted podcasts.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="eecf9e4fe3b24633afa43df8e2c0d5b2"></div><p>It would be a vast understatement to say Houser was a central figure during his 22 years at Rockstar, one of gaming’s all-time great success stories. He co-founded the legendary studio in 1998 with his brother Sam Houser, Jamie King, Terry Donovan and Gary Foreman. As Rockstar grew, he remained an integral part of the company’s creative works, including producing five Grand Theft Auto games and serving as a writer for every GTA installment to date (including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-11-18-grand-theft-auto-5-review-xbox-one-ps4.html"><em>Grand Theft Auto V</em></a>) and both <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-25-red-dead-redemption-2-review-crunch-rockstar.html">Red Dead Redemption</a> titles. In addition, he did voice work in <em>Grand Theft Auto III</em> and its two standalone expansion games.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/rockstar-games-co-founder-dan-houser-has-a-new-studio-183054769.html?src=rss

## ‘Cocoon’ is worth getting excited about

<p><em>Cocoon</em> is a game that makes perfect sense while you're playing it. That would be an unremarkable achievement if it wasn't also a game that forces you to use its levels to solve themselves. At Summer Game Fest 2023 I had around half an hour to play through the game’s opening, and it has stuck with me more than anything else I saw at the show.</p><p><em>Cocoon </em>is the debut game from Geometric Interactive, a studio founded by former Playdead employees Jeppe Carlsen and Jakob Schmid. Carlsen was the lead gameplay designer of the award-winning puzzle platformers <em>Limbo</em> and <em>Inside</em>, and Schmid the audio programmer of <em>Inside</em>. The pair also collaborated on <em>140</em>, a minimalistic indie platformer, and have been working on <em>Cocoon </em>with a small team in Denmark for over five years.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As in <em>Limbo</em>, <em>Inside</em> and <em>140</em>, controls and interactivity in general are pared back to a minimum. On an Xbox controller, that means movement with an analog stick and interactions confined to a single button. The complexity comes from the environment, the narrative from exploration. It’s reminiscent of <em>Tunic</em> or <em>Hyper Light Drifter</em> in its lack of dialogue and tutorials.</p><div id="e51587feea8940d286f2a2588d7e5c9b"></div><p>Orbs are everything in <em>Cocoon</em>. They're assets that open doors, trigger switches, reveal hidden paths and solve puzzles, but they’re also levels themselves. Remember that scene in <em>Men In Black</em> where there’s an entire galaxy in a little marble on a cat's collar? Geometric Interactive has taken that idea and made it a core mechanic. Each orb is a distinct world with its own vibe, original puzzle mechanics and a boss fight. You can hop in and out of these worlds by placing an orb into sockets dotted around the game, and can even bring orbs into other orbs, which, given the abilities they unlock, will likely be critical to finding paths forward.</p><p>I say there’s a “boss fight” in every orb, but there is no conventional combat in <em>Cocoon</em> – there is just a single interaction button, after all. You defeat bosses by using something in the environment like a water spout or an exploding mine. These fights are also forgiving: I took a “hit” once, and it revealed a delightful mechanic: Instead of dealing damage or killing me, the boss booted me out of its world. I then had to traverse back to the fight to finish it off. Defeating the two bosses I found granted new powers of sorts, in classic Metroidvania style, which allowed progression to new areas and the discovery of more orbs.</p><p>There were other simple environmental puzzles to solve. One involved ascertaining the order in which to hit some switches, another had me pulling towers around to open a door. A slightly trickier one involved some doubling back to navigate a hidden path. Given this was the very start of the game, I’m sure the complexity will ramp up significantly. By the end of my playthrough, I was already jumping in and out of worlds in order to get orbs to where they needed to be.&nbsp;</p><p>A colleague who was watching my demo said that they could tell I’ve &quot;played a lot of these types of games” — thing is, I haven’t. <em>Cocoon</em> is a game where everything makes sense, but you can’t explain why. I'm sure, as in other puzzle adventures, I'll get stumped in some places, but exploring this world felt completely natural. After a while I stopped being surprised that everything I tried just worked. Solving puzzles became a flow state as I giddily wandered around carrying my precious orbs.</p><p><em>Cocoon</em> is firmly at the top of my wishlist already, and it’s tough imagining anything overtaking it. It’s being published by Annapurna Interactive, and will come to Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation and Xbox consoles later this year.</p><p><em>Catch up on all of the news from Summer Game Fest </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/sgf-2023"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cocoon-is-worth-getting-excited-about-181529189.html?src=rss

## Twitch will give smaller streamers a bigger cut of subscriptions

<p>Twitch is giving livestreamers a considerably stronger incentive to grow their audiences. The service plans to <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2023/06/15/introducing-the-partner-plus-program/">roll out</a> a Partner Plus program that will give more successful creators a 70 percent share of their net subscription revenue instead of the usual 50 percent, up to a $100,000 threshold in the calendar year. A partner will qualify by holding on to at least 350 recurring paid subscriptions (gifts and Prime don't count) for three months. If they meet that standard, they'll get that 70 percent cut for the next 12 months regardless of whether or not they stay above the 350-subscription mark. This can extend indefinitely.</p><p>Partner Plus launches October 1st, and will automatically include anyone who meets the requirements for the three prior months. The program will be available worldwide, and doesn't offer anything beyond what Premium Partners (major creators who've negotiated special deals) receive.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This effort comes months after Twitch <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2022/09/21/a-letter-from-twitch-president-dan-clancy-on-subscription-revenue-shares/">announced</a> plans for an identical cap for Premium Partners. Twitch president at the time (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-co-founder-emmett-shear-steps-down-as-ceo-181041275.html">now CEO</a>) Dan Clancy claimed in September this wouldn't affect 90 percent of relevant streamers, and that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-opens-up-ad-program-increases-payout-052653003.html">increased ad payouts</a> would help make up the difference. However, that might still irk major streamers who depend on Twitch for a living — they're effectively taking a pay cut. There's a risk this may prompt other streamers to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/record-breaking-twitch-streamer-ludwig-is-moving-to-you-tube-131556917.html">jump to YouTube</a> and other platforms if they receive more lucrative terms.</p><p>Not that Twitch is necessarily concerned. Partner Plus increases the practical income for many more streamers than Premium, encouraging them to stick to the service — particularly if they're in the early stages of a livestreaming career. That theoretically increases the overall number of available channels, and keeps viewers from drifting to rivals.</p><p>Twitch has faced some difficulties in recent months, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjODEzYWUzOS03ZDU4LTQxY2ItYWM2Ni1hZDgzMDYwNmNlZWYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMC8yMi9idXNpbmVzcy90d2l0Y2gtc3RyZWFtZXJzLmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImE4NmQ1ZTU2LTBiZjUtNDk0NS1iMTc2LWQ3M2EyMDQ5ZDBlOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQymVbxwMF_OzzbNeqtzmWRDntt0lvDWbha7ken8S_tm&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2022%2F10%2F22%2Fbusiness%2Ftwitch-streamers.html">including a backlash</a> over the Premium revenue split and the impact of parent company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-will-lay-off-another-9000-employees-in-the-coming-weeks-152653190.html">Amazon's mass layoffs</a>.

## Microsoft is no longer making new games for the Xbox One

<p>Almost three years into the Xbox Series X/S lifecycle, Microsoft says it is no longer making games for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/xbox-one/">Xbox One</a>. While the company will continue to support ongoing previous-generation titles like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/minecraft/"><em>Minecraft</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/halo-infinite/"><em>Halo Infinite</em></a>, no Xbox Game Studios teams are working on new titles for the older console. &quot;We've moved on to gen 9,&quot; Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty told <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/06/15/xbox-game-studios-matt-booty"><em>Axios</em></a>, referring to the Xbox Series X/S consoles. The company also makes its games for PC.</p><p>This move had to happen at some point to avoid newer and more complex games being hamstrung by the hardware limitations of the decade-old Xbox One. Still, it'll be possible for those clinging onto an Xbox One to play Series X/S titles such as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/starfield/"><em>Starfield</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/forza-motorsport-wants-you-to-drive-forever-183033371.html"><em>Forza Motorsport</em></a> through <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-cloud-gaming-beta-180329068.html">Xbox Cloud Gaming</a>. “That’s how we’re going to maintain support,&quot; Booty said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The news comes in the wake of a strong showing for Xbox at its big annual showcase last weekend. It announced new titles such as Compulsion's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/south-of-midnight-is-a-southern-gothic-monster-adventure-from-compulsion-games-173100633.html"><em>South of Midnight</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and InXile’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/clockwork-revolution-is-a-time-traveling-rpg-of-steampunk-anarchy-183507054.html"><em>Clockwork Revolution</em></a>, while providing fresh looks at the likes of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/take-a-peek-at-xboxs-fable-reboot-in-action-172438277.html"><em>Fable</em></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/obsidian-fantasy-rpg-avowed-release-date-sgf-2023-174259416.html"><em>Avowed</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-will-arrive-in-2024-175240445.html"><em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II</em></a>.</p><p>The move away from Xbox One will free Microsoft's teams from the shackles of the previous generation.

## Live Nation and Ticketmaster to start showing hidden ticket costs

<p>It’s never fun when you buy a concert ticket for $30, only to find out it actually costs three times that after an endless series of amorphous fees. This has been at the heart of consumer revolt against companies like Ticketmaster for decades, and now things actually may be changing.</p><p>Ticketmaster and Live Nation are pledging to give US consumers the actual price of a ticket before they make a purchase, and not the fairyland price they use to lure in customers. President Biden is expected to officially announce the move during a meeting with live entertainment industry leaders later this afternoon, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2f007401-3eaa-4237-b69b-54ccbe125502&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Wall+Street+Journal&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyZjAwNzQwMS0zZWFhLTQyMzctYjY5Yi01NGNjYmUxMjU1MDIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy90aWNrZXRtYXN0ZXItc2VhdGdlZWstdG8tc2hvdy10aWNrZXQtYnV5ZXJzLWFsbC1pbi1wcmljaW5nLXRoYXQtaW5jbHVkZXMtZmVlcy03YzY2ZjAzOSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNGZlOTlmYzAtMDMzOS00ZTU1LWEzYWYtM2FiMWNjNDI0NGNmIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAc7aWmUD6H2kuTzyL8gKS2nof0XhyQBdCy8xnwSrEZRf&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Fticketmaster-seatgeek-to-show-ticket-buyers-all-in-pricing-that-includes-fees-7c66f039"><ins>as originally reported by the </ins><em><ins>Wall Street Journal.</ins></em></a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Biden has made this a crucial element of his “kitchen table” economic agenda since announcing he’d be putting pressure on companies to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/02/07/1155313067/biden-bill-stop-junk-fees-travel-entertainment-state-of-the-union-2023"><ins>eliminate hidden fees and surcharges</ins></a> during February's State of the Union address. Live Nation Entertainment, the company formed via a merger between Live Nation and Ticketmaster, has officially committed to making these transparency changes by September.</p><p>Though Live Nation/Ticketmaster has committed to the change, promising a “clear, total price”, Biden is heading up a roundtable discussion later today at the White House to encourage other companies like SeatGeek, Airbnb, DICE and many more to do the same. It’s expected that most companies attending the roundtable will make some kind of commitment toward consumer transparency. Airbnb has been especially unfriendly toward consumers in this respect, with all of those mysterious cleaning fees, but began <a href="https://www.engadget.com/airbnb-improved-price-transparency-152910440.html"><ins>addressing the issue of transparency</ins></a> late last year.</p><p>“Today’s voluntary actions demonstrate that companies both big and small recognize the importance of providing consumers with honest, up-front all-in pricing, rather than tricking them with surprise fees at the end of checkout. It is also just a first step towards addressing junk fees in the economy,” <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/06/15/president-biden-recognizes-actions-by-private-sector-ticketing-and-travel-companies-to-eliminate-hidden-junk-fees-and-provide-millions-of-customers-with-transparent-pricing/"><ins>the White House said in a statement.</ins></a></p><p>While these changes don’t eliminate junk fees (corporations gonna corporate) they do give consumers vital information that allows them to make informed purchase decisions, which is a start. Back in February, Biden proposed legislation <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/02/01/fact-sheet-president-biden-highlights-new-progress-on-his-competition-agenda/"><ins>called the Junk Fee Protection Act</ins></a> to actually reduce the presence of these hidden fees, including excessive charges when purchasing digital tickets to concerts and sporting events. Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) introduced similar legislation in Congress, but it hasn't come up for a vote.</p><p>Ticketmaster recently came under fire after running into a host of issues when selling Taylor Swift tickets for her “Eras” tour, leading to customers experiencing website outages, a preponderance of bots and extreme wait times. The company eventually canceled the sale altogether, due to not having enough supply to fill demand.

<p>Mercedes-Benz is putting <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chatgpt-is-suddenly-everywhere-are-we-ready-180031821.html">ChatGPT</a> on the road. The automaker is using <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-add-chat-gpt-azure-openai-062845310.html">Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI Service</a> to bring the viral natural-language model to its in-car voice assistant. It will initially be available in a three-month beta program for US customers in select vehicles, but Mercedes says it will consider a broader and more permanent rollout in the future.</p><p>ChatGPT integration could put the automaker’s “Hey Mercedes” voice assistant on steroids. Rather than merely answering simple and pre-programmed commands like “Turn up the heat” or “What’s the forecast,” it can carry natural conversations about virtually any topic, including contextual follow-up questions. (Children of the 1980s can finally live out their <em>Knight Rider</em> fantasies.) In addition, Mercedes says it’s “exploring” <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chatgpts-new-plugins-will-deliver-real-time-stats-182900388.html">ChatGPT plugins</a> to enable tasks like making restaurant reservations or booking movie tickets through natural language.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Although holding a lengthy chat on the road could lead to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-05-nhtsa-in-car-monitoring-regulation-distracted-driving-safety.html">distracted driving</a>, the fact that it’s voice-only should lessen the concern for recklessness. Perhaps it could even help by answering questions you’d otherwise be tempted to look up on your phone while behind the wheel.</p><p>Mercedes and Microsoft tout Azure’s “enterprise-grade security, privacy and reliability” for data protection. Still, the companies clarify that your conversations will be “stored in the Mercedes-Benz Intelligent Cloud, where it is anonymised and analysed.” In other words, assume people will listen to your recordings for training and data analysis, so be wary about uttering anything that’s private or could identify you personally.</p><p>The three-month beta begins on June 16th and will only cover select Mercedes models running the MBUX infotainment system. (You can view the list of eligible vehicles in the footnotes <a href="https://media.mercedes-benz.com/article/323212b5-1b56-458a-9324-20b25cc176cb">here</a>.) To enter the program in a qualified model, tell the car’s built-in voice assistant, “Hey Mercedes, I want to join the beta program.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-tries-putting-chatgpt-in-your-car-162822051.html?src=rss

## VW’s next Tiguan PHEV can drive 62 miles in electric-only mode

<p>Volkswagen's next plug-in hybrid (PHEV) may be particularly appealing if you're determined to avoid using the gas engine whenever possible. The automaker has <a href="https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/press-releases/final-set-up-drives-new-tiguan-with-premium-class-technologies-and-a-long-electric-range-17326">shared</a> the first details of its next-gen Tiguan SUV, and the PHEV model will manage up to 62 miles of all-electric range. That's about twice the range of the existing Tiguan eHybrid, and makes the 37.5 miles of Toyota's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/toyota-2023-prius-prime-plug-in-hybrid-162057073.html">Prius Prime</a> seem modest. You might only need to rely on combustion power for long-distance trips.</p><p>The jump to a new MQB evo platform (and thus new electric motors) is partly credited for the extended PHEV range. It also allows for an electronically-controlled suspension that promises better handling and more comfort, and enables both faster AC charging on the plug-in model as well as DC charging. It's now more practical to charge the Tiguan overnight or at a rest stop, in other words.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="2024 VW Tiguan interior" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/f74252f0-0b8c-11ee-bbfb-1744aec27c0b" style="height: 1280px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Volkswagen</div></figure><p>VW has also revamped the in-cabin technology. The infotainment system now uses up to a 15-inch screen, and there's a digital instrument cluster with rotary-based control. There's even a nod to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vw-unveils-the-larger-idbuzz-electric-van-headed-to-north-america-070132379.html">ID-series EVs</a> with a switch on the steering column to change drive modes. The new Tiguan will only be available with a dual-clutch automatic gearbox.</p><p>The updated Tiguan will officially debut in the fall, with models reaching dealerships in 2024. We wouldn't count on a North American release of the PHEV edition when it hasn't been available in the region so far. However, VW's effort hints at the direction of hybrids for the industry at large. The electric-only range is now good enough to cover a wide range of driving scenarios, and may be enticing if you're not quite ready to buy a pure EV.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/vws-next-tiguan-phev-can-drive-62-miles-in-electric-only-mode-153155679.html?src=rss

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/uber/"><ins>Uber</ins></a> will soon start displaying video ads in its apps. They’ll appear while you wait for a ride to show up and while you’re in transit, after you place orders in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/uber-eats/"><ins>Uber Eats</ins></a> and in search results and other parts of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/drizly/"><ins>Drizly</ins></a>, the company told <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2f007401-3eaa-4237-b69b-54ccbe125502&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Wall+Street+Journal&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyZjAwNzQwMS0zZWFhLTQyMzctYjY5Yi01NGNjYmUxMjU1MDIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy92aWRlby1hZHMtYXJlLWNvbWluZy10by1hbGwteW91ci11YmVyLWFwcHMtY2IxMWQ0OGU_bW9kPWRqZW1hbGVydE5FV1MiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImQwMWViNjFmLTY5YmItNDc0Yy05NjE3LTY1OTM1N2M3OTg5YSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAARuS5Xg_7_eiNLJYiktstkLrbiLBeN58TunUdl31MTTr&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Fvideo-ads-are-coming-to-all-your-uber-apps-cb11d48e%3Fmod%3DdjemalertNEWS"><em><ins>The Wall Street Journal</ins></em></a>. Ads will also be shown on tablets that are placed inside some Uber cars.</p><p>Users in the US will start seeing video ads this week. Tablets displaying ads will be installed on a city-by-city basis in the country. The company plans to roll out video ads in the UK, France, Australia and other markets later this year.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Static ads have been shown <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-06-uber-eats-advertising-ads.html"><ins>in Uber Eats since 2019</ins></a> and in the company’s eponymous ride-hailing app since last year. The company started offering new ad tools in Drizly, the alcohol-ordering app <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-buys-drizly-alcohol-delivery-service-145942834.html"><ins>it bought in 2021</ins></a>, last year. Mark Grether, vice president and general manager of Uber’s advertising division, said the company is on course to clear $1 billion in ad revenue in 2024.</p><p>The video ads in the apps will be muted by default (audio will play on tablets that are in cars) and will run for up to 90 seconds. An Uber ride lasts around 15 minutes on average, and users typically spend between two and three minutes looking at the app during trips. “We have two minutes of your attention. We know where you are, we know where you are going to, we know what you have eaten,” Grether told the <em>Journal</em>. “We can use all of that to then basically target a video ad towards you.”</p><p>The company says it won't share individuals' data with advertisers. You’ll be able to opt out of ad targeting based on demographic data and your activity in Uber's apps, but you can’t opt out of ads altogether, Uber says. Unless, of course, you lock your phone or switch to another app.</p><p>It’s not yet clear whether you’ll be able to immediately close an ad once it starts playing. If not, users may temporarily be unable to access certain features in Uber’s apps, such as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-will-start-rolling-out-teen-accounts-with-safety-features-next-week-150018174.html"><ins>the safety tools</ins></a> and the ability to message a driver or Uber Eats courier.

## Google forced to delay Bard AI's EU launch over privacy concerns

<p>Europeans wanting to try <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-bard-ai-hands-on-a-work-in-progress-with-plenty-of-caveats-170956025.html">Google Bard</a> will have to wait. The Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC), the main overseer of data in the European Union, has <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/google-postpone-bard-chatbot-eu-launch-privacy-concern/">forced</a> Google to delay the rollout of its Bard chatbot in the region. The generative AI was supposed to launch in the EU this week, but IDPC Deputy Commissioner Graham Doyle says his agency hasn't received a &quot;detailed&quot; privacy briefing, a data impact assessment or supporting info.</p><p>The Commission is still in the midst of an &quot;ongoing examination&quot; of Bard, according to Doyle. It isn't estimating when it might wrap up that investigation, but it plans to share info with other EU data regulators as quickly as possible.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We've asked Google for comment. In a statement to <em>Politico</em>, a Google spokesperson says the company promised to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-bard-transitions-to-palm-2-and-expands-to-180-countries-172908926.html">expand Bard access</a> &quot;responsibly&quot; after discussing its efforts with experts and governments. This includes talking to privacy regulars to &quot;address their questions and hear feedback,&quot; the representative says.</p><p>Google began widening access to Bard in March, when it let would-be users sign up for a waiting list. In May, it dropped the waitlist and expanded availability to 180 more countries and territories. The tech giant shied away from the EU, where the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) sets strict requirements on how personal data is collected and shared.</p><p>Other AI developers have already faced tighter scrutiny. Germany, Italy and Spain are currently investigating OpenAI's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chatgpt-is-suddenly-everywhere-are-we-ready-180031821.html">ChatGPT</a> alongside the European Data Protection Board, and Italy temporarily <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chatgpt-is-once-again-available-in-italy-after-a-temporary-ban-195716663.html">banned the tool</a> over worries both the chatbot and its training methods (using others' real-world content) might violate the GDPR. A delay for Bard theoretically minimizes the chances of similar conflicts for Google.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-forced-to-delay-bard-ais-eu-launch-over-privacy-concerns-134124905.html?src=rss

## ‘Under the Waves’ is a sad but relaxing oceanic adventure

<p>Parallel Studio’s <em>Under the Waves </em>is a relaxing game. Between the cheers and jeers from <em>Crash Team Rumble</em> players (possibly employees) nearby, I was diving. Diving deeper and deeper into the inky blue, chasing a jettisoned shipping container as it bounced off rocks, spilling soft toys and revealing a mysteriously abandoned submarine hidden deeper still. While I might have been relaxed, I was a little unsettled.</p><p>First <a href="https://www.engadget.com/under-waves-quantic-dream-2023-xbox-playstation-pc-184634057.html">announced</a> at last year’s Gamescom, in <em>Under the Waves</em> you play as Stan. And he doesn’t seem to be in a good place. My demo started on the third day of his placement at an underwater living pod, but I know (from the game’s synopsis) that he’s down there quite literally to get away from it all. He appears to be grieving the loss of his daughter, but it’s only lightly touched on during these opening parts of the game. Stan seems unsettled and twitchy in bed (and facially twitchy in general – hopefully, his face will settle down with more time in development).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At the start of the demo, Stan wakes with a piercing headache and picks up a call from what I assume is an offshore coworker called Tim. He reveals that the living pod’s oxygen mix is out of whack, likely explaining the sore head. Tim even added that a previous worker failed to flag his headaches, and by the time the rest of the dive team, the worker had started hallucinating. (And of course, Stan gets his own hallucination moments very soon after.</p><figure><img alt="Under The Waves" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/59245580-08aa-11ee-975e-83a719e59510" style="height: 1080px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Quantic Dreams</div></figure><p>While you’re able to walk around your oxygenated living quarters, most of the game is spent in the ocean, either diving with a limited amount of oxygen (which can be replenished using oxygen sticks) or while steering your own deep-sea vehicle, which can cover ground quicker and help conserve oxygen.</p><p>In a nod to the reality of ocean waste, spent oxygen sticks will float where you leave them. These can be collected and converted into plastic. Throughout the game there will be machines and crafting blueprints so you’ll be able to make your own items (like more oxygen sticks) from plastic, metal and other materials found floating or left on the ocean floor. (Parallel Studio have partnered with Surfrider Foundation Europe to support its ocean preservation aims.)</p><p>While the ocean floor is attractive and interesting, the man-made features have a retro-futuristic design, like an alternate future that’s… in the past. Like <em>Prey</em> or the more recent <em>Deathloop</em>, the anachronistic combination, somehow works.</p><p>Stan is equipped with a scanner, making it infinitely easier to decode instructions from Tim and other objectives. You’ll still have to pay attention though, a little like <em>Firewatch</em>. When Stan heads out to fix the oxygen issues, you’ll have to trace the route of several pipes, noting the broken ones based on their red bulbs. The scanner doesn’t simply do everything, but it does ensure you’re at least headed in the right direction.</p><p>In a lot of ways, whether it’s the story yet to be revealed or the uneasy tension that is touched on regularly, it reminds me of <em>Firewatch</em>, even if it’s all set undersea. While this is developed by Parallel Studio, it’ll be published Quantic Dream’s new Spotlight arm, focused on new developer IP. Quantic Dream has created several games, including <em>Heavy Rain </em>and<em> Detroit: Become Human</em>, which placed a huge focus on narrative and storytelling. For developer Parallel Studios, it seems a good fit.</p><p><em>Under the Waves</em> launches on August 29th, 2023.</p><div id="a86f01c9426a4b31bd9b5a3f2e6368ed"></div><p><em>Catch up on all of the news from Summer Game Fest </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/sgf-2023"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/under-the-waves-is-a-sad-but-relaxing-oceanic-adventure-130037105.html?src=rss

## ‘Star Trek: Strange New Worlds’ picks up where it left off

<p><em>The following article contains spoilers for “The Broken Circle.”</em></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/you-can-watch-the-entire-first-season-of-star-trek-strange-new-worlds-for-free-on-youtube-183553558.html"><em>Strange New Worlds</em></a>’ first season may have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-preview-040051197.html">stumbled out of the gate</a>, but it outdid itself with every <a href="https://www.engadget.com/strange-new-worlds-109-review-130012075.html">subsequent</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-110-a-quality-of-mercy-review-130037849.html">episode</a>. On the strength of the back half of its episodes alone, you could easily call it the best live-action Trek of the streaming era. This achievement was staggering, especially since it was saddled with the nightmare brief of serving as a spin-off to <em>Discovery</em>, a prequel to <em>Star Trek </em>and a paean to fans less than enamored with its serialized stablemates. It quickly found a tone that would serve those many masters, offering episodic storytelling with soap opera characterization that quickly teased out Star Trek’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/strange-new-worlds-108-review-130025022.html">oft-denied goofy side</a>. It quickly found the confidence to be silly, and dramatic, and even made time to show the crew hanging out with each other, and above all else, it was accessible to mainstream audiences.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That confidence is proudly on show here in “The Broken Circle,” the season two opener credited to co-showrunners Henry Alonso Myers and Akiva Goldsman. Watching this, you get the sense that every person in the production team is pulling in the same direction, with fantastic results. It helps that Myers and Goldsman again write their crew making smart choices pretty much all of the time, sparing us any sludgy plot blocking. In fact, the quickness of its narrative and the sheer brute-force of its charisma helps cover a multitude of sins, turning what is otherwise a fairly light romp into something that will, hopefully, set the tone for the rest of the season.</p><p>We open with the Enterprise in spacedock, undergoing a (weirdly testy) inspection while Pike tries to find someone who can help save Number One from her upcoming court martial. He leaves an unusually-flustered Spock in charge of the Enterprise, who isn’t feeling up to the task. That’s because he can’t get his emotions back under control after unleashing his inner rage monster back in “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/strange-new-worlds-109-review-130012075.html">All Those Who Wander</a>,” and seeks help from Dr. M’Benga. He hands him a Lute and tells him to work on his emotions like a human, and when Chapel walks in, the good Doctor can’t help but notice the tension. On the bridge, meanwhile, Uhura receives a coded message from La’an, who has uncovered a plot against the Federation on the edge of Klingon space.</p><p>Sadly, April turns down Spock’s plea to investigate, and so enlists the bridge crew to steal the Enterprise. And yes, while this is comedically punctured soon after, I’ll admit to sighing myself inside out as I expected to sit through the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-picard-season-3-paramount-plus-preview-review-080010710.html"><ins>second </ins><em><ins>Search for Spock</ins></em><ins> homage in three months</ins></a>. Mercifully, the heist is disrupted by Pelia, the immortal head of the inspection team – Carol Kane playing a stock Carol Kane-type character. Pelia, as a friend of Spock’s mom Amanda, decides to aid in the deception to get the crew underway. They find La’an on a dilithium rich planet which was contested during the Klingon war, and is now under the control of a gang of nefarious types. They’re annoyed that their profit margins have been eroded in peacetime, and would much prefer to restart the Federation - Klingon war to boost profits.</p><p>It’s Dr. M’Benga and Chapel who get the meat of the action here, as they are kidnapped and taken to a fake Federation starship being built underground. They correctly surmise that the ship will be used to – another sigh – stage a false flag attack on the Klingons to restart the war. In order to warn the Enterprise, they go heavy on the steroids and punch-fight their way to the ship’s transponder to send them a message. Unfortunately, the ship breaks ground to attack an arriving cruiser, forcing the Enterprise to give chase. But Spock’s reticent to open fire, since the (not so) secret object of his (not so) secret affections is still on board.</p><p>Thankfully, M’Benga and Chapel blast their way out into space without any EVA gear and get beamed aboard by the pursuing Enterprise (<a href="https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2013/space-human-body/"><ins>I know,</ins><em><ins> I know!</ins></em></a>). Spock is then left to smooth things over with the Klingons, downing a mug or two of blood wine to demonstrate his fortitude to his new friends. April’s happy to give him a slap on the wrist for his heroics, mostly because his focus is on a looming war with the Gorn. And with that, we’re back at the races.</p><figure><img alt="Celia Rose Gooding as Uhura and Ethan Peck as Spock appearing in episode 201 &#x00201c;The Broken Circle&#x00201d; of Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, streaming on Paramount+, 2023.

There are plenty of times that information is conveyed visually rather than with radio-style narration. The silent nod between La’an and M’Benga, when we’re trusted to know what a Starfleet ship looks like by sight alone, and the results of Chapel and M’Benga’s steroid hit. I know this is basic stuff, but it’s right to praise a show that’s able to avoid falling into its own worst habits, and Chris Fisher’s snappy direction deserves plenty of praise.</p><p>I could be wrong, but it feels as if the visuals have improved, too, both in scope and execution. The crew seems to have gotten to grips with how best to use its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/percival-rebellion-virtual-studio-filmmaking-160053709.html"><ins>virtual production stage</ins></a>, putting it to effective use in several scenes. We’re still a long way from being able to light big walls of TV screens like the real outdoors, but the effect wasn’t jarring. It was also another episode where savvy use of pre-existing sets was disguised well-enough – at least until you wonder why a criminal crew building a fake starship would bother to equip it with a sickbay, at least.</p><p>The one downside to all of this, really, is my usual one, which is that I still can’t shake the feeling some of this stuff is better suited to the <em>other</em> Star franchise. Clandestine meetings with arms dealers where you prove your mettle with how well you hold your drink or a (fake) grenade. A face-punching interrogation scene seconds after being reminded the Federation prohibits torture. A corridor-based punch-fight in which the two people least-qualified to be ass-kickers turn into ass-kicking ninjas for five minutes at a time. Yes, Star Trek of old could be violent, but I don’t think it was ever this cynical or nihilistic, even in the <em>Deep Space Nine</em> days.</p><p>For now, let’s welcome <em>Strange New Worlds</em> back for another run, where it’s only got to maintain its reputation as the best live-action Trek. No pressure, then.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-picks-up-where-it-left-off-130025200.html?src=rss

<p>Amazon and Disney have partnered to create an interactive experience that combines Alexa’s voice assistant features with Disney’s robust stable of characters. The appropriately-named “Hey Disney!” is now available on any Echo device and represents the very first time Amazon has allowed an assistant other than Alexa on its various speakers and tablets.</p><p>Once you purchase an annual subscription to the new voice assistant via the Alexa Skills Store, you’ll have some brand new ways to interact with your Echo gadgets. The wake word changes to “Hey Disney!” which gives you access to something called the “Disney Magical Companion.” This opens up 20 new personalities and voices to interact with across Disney’s entire corporate roster, including Pixar movies and the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise. Additionally, the service is being included as a perk to Amazon Kids+ at no added cost.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Once you call up your favorite character, you’ll get some extra personality when asking for the weather or setting an alarm. Amazon gives examples of Olaf from <em>Frozen</em> reading the weather and a themed soundscape inspired by <em>Return of the Jedi’s</em> moon of Endor. There’s also an emphasis here on storytelling, with Amazon touting “interactive adventures with characters” and “immersive entertainment.” Finally, there’s a new multiplayer Disney trivia game. These modes exist as voice-only experiences for Echo speakers and with visuals for Echo Show tablets.</p><p>This is not the first we’ve heard of this unique branding. The voice assistant was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disneyland-hey-disney-release-date-220908254.html">first revealed last year,</a> but it was an exclusive release to Disney Resort hotels. Now it’s available to everyone, so long as you pony up for a dedicated subscription or already have a Kids+ plan.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/amazons-hey-disney-experience-comes-to-all-echo-devices-130009651.html?src=rss

## Intel drops ‘i’ processor branding after 15 years, introduces ‘Ultra’ for higher-end chips

<p>Today Intel is cleaning up its processor branding, hopefully making it easier to understand. Starting with the new Meteor Lake generation of processors, the company is moving from its traditional &quot;i3/i5/i7/i9&quot; branding to a simpler &quot;Core 3/5/7/9&quot; concept. Intel says the rebranding “better aligns to customer requests” to simplify its processor names and that the change will be reflected in text and on the badge. This is significant as Intel has been using the &quot;i&quot; branding for its processor for well over a decade.</p><p>Intel’s higher-end processors will include &quot;Ultra&quot; in their branding before the number — in practice that would look like “Intel Core Ultra 9.&quot; And for those who want more information, Intel says generational information will continue to be tacked on to the end (&quot;Intel Core 9 processor 1300AB,&quot; for example.) The company stated that both the standard Core and Core Ultra processors can be paired with its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-arc-graphics-cards-ray-tracing-ai-super-sampling-152717653.html">Intel Arc graphics</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As far as what hasn't changed in Intel's processor branding, the higher number still denotes a faster processor. Naturally, Core Ultra models will come packed with additional speed and power. At the time of writing, Intel has yet to announce a release date or specifics for its new Meteor Lake processors. Though, <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intels-meteor-lake-begins-production-launches-this-year-on-intel-4-process">rumors</a> suggest that they’ll be coming sometime this year.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/intel-drops-i-processor-branding-after-15-years-introduces-ultra-for-higher-end-chips-130100277.html?src=rss

Everything from gadgets to clothes to household necessities will be on sale during the event, and if you’re a Prime member, you’ll have access to all of the deals on Amazon’s site. Engadget will be surfacing all of the best tech deals we can find – both on Amazon and elsewhere – but there are some important things to know ahead of time so you can get exactly what you want out of this year’s Prime Day.</p><h2>When is Amazon Prime Day?</h2><p>It's still unclear when Amazon Prime Day 2023 will take place. If Amazon follows the familiar pattern, Prime Day 2023 could be mid-July: the two-day sale event took place on July 12th and 13th in 2022. Since it's already the middle of June, we expect Amazon to publicly announce the dates for Prime Day 2023 soon and we'll update this post once that information becomes available.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>What is Amazon Prime Day?</h2><p>Amazon's annual shopping event surfaces exclusive deals for Prime members, which means you’ll have to be a Prime subscriber on Prime Day to take advantage of any of the savings.

You can safely bet on things like Echo speakers, Kindle e-readers and Fire TV devices to be at record-low prices for Prime Day, so if you’ve had your eye on one of those items, Prime Day is the time to buy. Prime Day is only matched by Black Friday in its discounts, so while that means you will likely have another chance to get that smart speaker for dirt cheap, it probably won’t be until the holiday shopping season.</p><p>Make no mistake, Amazon gadgets will not be the only items discounted on Prime Day. You’ll find clothes, shoes, household items, appliances, accessories and more on sale, but here at Engadget, we’ll naturally be focusing on electronics. We expect this year’s Prime Day to be like last year’s, in that it will bring big discounts on headphones, earbuds, gaming accessories, SSDs and microSD cards, robot vacuums and more.</p><figure><img alt="Indianapolis - Circa July 2019: Amazon Prime delivery van. Amazon.com is getting In the delivery business With Prime branded vans" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-09/c4f5b210-edf8-11ea-bfdf-78df2c9073b2" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">jetcityimage via Getty Images</div></figure><p>It’s also worth mentioning the types of deals you can expect to see on Prime Day. Some deals will be live for the entire event, while others will be one-day-only sales. Those are the hardest to predict, since Amazon usually does not give any indication how long a given sale will last. Our recommendation is to buy the things you’re most keen on as soon as you see them drop in price – that will ensure you get it while the discount is available, and while the item is still in stock.</p><p>You can also expect to see some “Lightning deals” happen during Prime Day. Thankfully, these are usually clearly labeled with the amount of time remaining to grab the deal noted on the product page. In our experience, only a handful of these flash sales are actually worth your money, but if you see something that’s been on your wishlist drop in price for the next few hours, it’s in your best interest to grab it immediately.</p><h2>How to prep for Amazon Prime Day</h2><p>We’ve alluded to this already, but it’s best to go into Amazon Prime Day as prepared as possible. That essentially means knowing exactly what you want to look for so you stay focused and avoid distractions. The whole of Amazon.com will be overwhelming on Prime Day, so the less time you spend aimlessly browsing, the more your wallet will thank you later.</p><p>Two simple things you can do ahead of Prime Day are make a list and bookmark a price tracker. For the former, take note of the most important items you want to pick up on Prime Day. You can either do this the old-fashioned way on a sticky note, or you can use Amazon’s wish list feature. For the latter, add the items you want to buy on Prime Day to your wish list (or, even better, make a dedicated wishlist with only your Prime Day desirables) and return to that list during the shopping event. Not only will you have everything you want all in one place, but you’ll also be able to see which of those items are cheaper on Prime Day than they were when you originally added them to your list.</p><p>As for the price tracker, sites like <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/">CamelCamelCamel</a> let you monitor the price of specific items on Amazon. You can check out price history charts and you can make your own price-drop alerts, receiving emails when something you want gets a discount. CamelCamelCamel also has some browser extensions you can download so you don’t have to navigate away from an Amazon product page to check its price history.</p><p>We know that not everyone – not even every Prime member – will be flocking to Amazon during Prime Day. Whether you find such blatant displays of consumerism off putting or you simply don’t want to give Amazon more of your money, there are plenty of reasons why you might be skipping Prime Day all together. But that doesn’t mean you have to skip <em>all</em> of the sales that will be happening during that same time. Retailers like Walmart, Target, Best Buy and others will all have competing Prime Day sales and many of them will match the discounted prices you’ll find on Amazon. We recommend checking them out if you want to pick up a couple of things for less without spending money on Amazon.</p><p>Engadget will be covering the entirety of Prime Day, so if you have a lot of tech on your to-buy list, be sure to check back here on Prime Day for the best tech sales we could find. We’ll be sure to include gadgets from across the board – from headphones to robot vacuums to gaming gear – plus the best “anti-Prime Day” deals you can find from other retailers. You can also follow the <a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals">@EngadgetDeals Twitter account</a> and subscribe to the <a href="https://subscription.yahoo.net/Newsletter/Preference/sub?b=engadgetdeals&amp;src">Engadget Deals newsletter</a> to stay up to date on the latest discounts. The volume of deals will be daunting, but we sift through them all and pick out the best ones to make Prime Day a bit easier for you.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-day-2023-124519231.html?src=rss

## MSI Stealth 14 Studio review: A redesign done right

<p>MSI's Stealth laptops have long been one of my favorite gaming notebook lines thanks to their blend of performance and portability. But <a href="https://www.engadget.com/msi-stealth-15m-review-coasting-on-its-good-looks-192429083.html">last year's model</a> was a disappointment. After a few years of sticking with the same design, its chassis felt tired and refreshed specs didn't address the system's underlying issues. But for 2023, MSI has given the Stealth a complete makeover including a brand new design, an optional 240Hz display, more powerful components and not one but two sizes to choose from. Heck, there are so many additions MSI even changed the name of the entire series: The Stealth Studio. After using one for the past few weeks, I feel like we might be looking at the most improved gaming laptop of the year.</p><h2>Design</h2><p>I've been testing the 14-inch version, but there's also a larger 16-inch model, with both sizes sporting a slick magnesium aluminum exterior that's available in two colors: pure white and star blue. Admittedly, the white model isn't very stealthy, but I don't care because it looks fantastic <em>and</em> it’s super light. It weighs just 3.75 pounds, which is almost a full half pound less than rivals like the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=b1bb23c9-a2d4-4e4e-bfac-7a560ebe7641&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Dell&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJiMWJiMjNjOS1hMmQ0LTRlNGUtYmZhYy03YTU2MGViZTc2NDEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGVsbC5jb20vZW4tdXMvc2hvcC9kZWxsLWxhcHRvcHMvYWxpZW53YXJlLXgxNC1yMi1nYW1pbmctbGFwdG9wL3NwZC9hbGllbndhcmUteDE0LXIyLWxhcHRvcCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMmIzM2Y2ZTctOGYzNS00NDJlLTlhYzktMDgxOTBlMjcyZTIzIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAbwQrP1FNYqhaH048627QGKtoq5uvT24cnUdtoiE0DYH&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fdell-laptops%2Falienware-x14-r2-gaming-laptop%2Fspd%2Falienware-x14-r2-laptop">Alienware x14 R2</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="2a199b45b84c42dda5699cb76722bd6f"></div><p></p><p>Despite its small size you still get solid connectivity, including three USB ports (one Type-A and two Type-C) and a full-size HDMI jack. But more importantly, there are a ton of tiny features throughout the system that show MSI's attention to detail. On the vents in back, the grille spells out the name of the system, kind of like you might get on a sports car. And in front, MSI has partnered with SteelSeries to deliver gorgeous RGB lighting on its keyboard. MSI also added some small, up-firing stereo speakers in front, which provide a nice upgrade in audio quality from the previous model. You even get a physical shutter for the webcam. Sure, it's just a little plastic flap, but I'm glad it's there.</p><figure><img alt="One of the nifty touches on the Stealth 14 Studio's design is rear RGB lighting that spells out the name of the system. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/48b2a5d0-0a21-11ee-8ff4-7db89f0b2102" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>My two small gripes are that the webcam is only 720p – come on MSI, it’s 2023 – and that the chin below the screen looks a bit ungainly. Even if you ignore how big it is, I wish MSI had gone with a hinge that cut down on the gap between the display and deck, because it can be kind of a distraction to see the rear lights shining through while working or gaming.</p><h2>Display</h2><p>By default, the Stealth 14 Studio comes with a 1920 x 1200 165Hz IPS display, which is a good place to start. However, our review unit has MSI's upgraded 2560 x 1600 240Hz screen and it's a real treat. In testing, I measured peak brightness just shy of 450 nits which is almost double what we got from last year's machine. That makes it great for playing all sorts of games, and thanks to a color gamut that covers 100 percent of the DCI-P3 spectrum, it can pull double duty as a photo or video editing workstation too.</p><h2>Performance</h2><figure><img alt="Similar to previous models, MSI has partnered with SteelSeries to provide an easy way to customize the RGB backlighting on the Stealth 14 Studio." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/93a35ee0-0a21-11ee-abff-68b1230d2eac" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Packing an Intel Core i7-13700H chip, NVIDIA RTX 4060, 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD, the Stealth 14 Studio has more than enough performance for pretty much any task. In games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Returnal</em> at 1080p and max settings, the Stealth Studio hit 67 and 78 fps respectively, which is actually a touch higher than what I got from a Razer Blade 18 with the same GPU and an i9 chip.</p><p>That's pretty impressive when you consider that the MSI's smaller chassis means it has way less room inside to manage thermals. Even on synthetic tests like PCMark 10, the Stealth Studio edged out the Blade 18 with a score of 8,126 versus 7,236, despite the Razer costing over $1,000 more than the MSI. This just goes to show that bigger and more expensive isn’t always better.</p><figure><img alt="Another nice quality-of-life tweak on the Stealth 14 Studio is a simple built-in webcam shutter. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/6ed86ce0-0a21-11ee-9fff-5a1ba2bc4e71" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Lately, I've been playing a lot of <em>Diablo 4 </em>which really shows off the capabilities of the Stealth 14 Studio. You can turn down the graphics to take advantage of the screen's speedy refresh rate or enable all the game's bells and whistles while still staying well above 60 fps.</p><p>The two small downsides to the Stealth 14 Studio's performance are that it runs kind of hot and it tops out with an RTX 4070, which is understandable given its size. I tried to game with it on my lap while watching TV, and trust me when I say that it gets real toasty. So unless you have a lapboard, you're better off sitting at a desk or table.</p><h2>Battery Life</h2><figure><img alt="In addition to one USB-C, one USB-A and a headphone jack on the right side of the system, the Stealth 14 Studio also features a full-size HDMI jack and another USB-C port. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/ce1f8360-0a2a-11ee-b5bd-7c76b7475ee6" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Coming from last year’s model that conked out after a little more than four hours, MSI has delivered some notable gains here too. On our video rundown test, the Stealth 14 Studio lasted five hours and 19 minutes, which is up 25 percent over last year's system. But what's even better is that it also beat out larger rivals (with bigger batteries) including both the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-blade-16-review-4k-1080p-miniled-screen-151100229.html">Blade 16 (5:01)</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-rog-zephyrus-m16-2023-review-big-performance-with-a-brilliant-display-134540091.html">ASUS' ROG Zephyrus M16 (4:38)</a>.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>The Stealth 14 Studio is an almost complete about-face for MSI's thin-and-light gaming line. It's got a striking new design, updated internals and a handful of welcome quality-of-life upgrades – all in a chassis that's easy to carry around; I've already made multiple cross-country trips with it and it hasn't let me down yet. In fact, the Stealth 14 Studio has basically everything I look for in a great all-rounder – well, except for maybe an OLED screen or an SD card slot (though you do get one on the larger 16-inch model).</p><figure><img alt="All things considered, the Stealth 14 Studio's hot vents and lack of support for an RTX 4080 GPU are relatively minor downsides. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/05a84790-0a2b-11ee-bf7b-915f340c6b1e" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>But if those aren’t deal breakers for you, MSI has delivered a system offering a stunning build and solid performance for gaming or anything else you might need. And with our upgraded model currently going for $1,900, you're getting more storage and a faster CPU and GPU than a base Alienware x14 R2 for only $150 more. So, after a down year, MSI has restored the Stealth – ahem the Stealth Studio – back to its former glory as a system that can do a bit of everything while looking great too.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/msi-stealth-14-studio-review-a-redesign-done-right-123028890.html?src=rss

<p>If you regularly use people who regularly use more than one WhatsApp account this new beta update is going to be of interest to you. The messaging app is reportedly working on multi-account support for its Android app, an update that would allow you to switch between profiles on the same device, <a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-23-13-5-whats-new/"><em>WABetaInfo reports</em></a>. The feature appears to work just like changing accounts on fellow <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-05-instagram-account-linking.html">Meta-owned app Instagram</a> with a pop-up at the bottom of your app showing current accounts and the option to add new ones.&nbsp;</p><div id="84a0779282ed43698ad9d68baf9ae5cb"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">📝 WhatsApp beta for Android 2.23.13.5: what's new?<br /><br />Thanks to the business version of the app, we discovered that WhatsApp is working on a multi-account feature, and it will be available in a future update of the app!<a href="https://t.co/jDnLxnJtbv">https://t.co/jDnLxnJtbv</a><a href="https://t.co/kz4PrYbCvX">pic.twitter.com/kz4PrYbCvX</a></p>— WABetaInfo (@WABetaInfo) <a href="https://twitter.com/WABetaInfo/status/1669119668492066824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 14, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>Any new accounts will be stored within your device and, of course, can be logged out of at any point.

<p>Logitech has rolled out new AI-powered tools for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/streamlabs-creator-subscription-095053962.html">Streamlabs</a> platform that could make editing podcasts go much, much faster. Starting today, Streamlabs Ultra subscribers will get access to Podcast Editor, which provides easy text-based editing capabilities that they could use to auto-generate transcripts and real-time translations. They could also use the editor to add subtitles to their video podcasts in several languages, as well as create clips in different sizes (and with different template designs) for sharing on platforms, such as Facebook and TikTok.&nbsp;</p><p>The screenshot below shows the tool's interface with its text editor where users can highlight parts of the transcript and automatically create short clips featuring those sections of their podcast. That editor is also where users can generate translations, as well as style and insert subtitles. Users can also remove filler words like &quot;ums&quot; and awkward pauses from their podcasts within just a few seconds using the tool.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Logitech, which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-27-logitech-streamlabs.html">purchased</a> the creator of the Streamlabs OBS livestreaming app back in 2019, says Podcast Editor could trim hours off creators' total edit time. Although Streamlabs Ultra subscribers will get the most out of Podcast Editor, seeing as the paid service allows them to manage 40 hours of content, non-paying users will also get limited access to the tool. They can use Podcast Editor through the <a href="https://streamlabs.com/">free version of Streamlabs</a> and edit one hour of content at no cost every month.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="A screenshot showing Streamlabs' new Podcast Editor tool.

## The Morning After: Anker gets into the home solar battery game

<p>Anker, which made its name building device batteries and chargers, is now making gear for all of the devices you own. Or at least all of the devices <em>in your home</em>, since it just unveiled its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ankers-new-solix-home-energy-storage-includes-a-modular-solar-battery-system-085432144.html"><ins>Solix home energy system</ins></a>, which can be bolted onto existing or new domestic solar setups. Like many other home battery companies out there, Solix is scalable, with the smallest unit sized at 5kWh – enough for a few hours backup power – all the way up to 180kWh. It won’t arrive until 2024 but, when it does, it’ll be paired with an EV charging system Anker is presently cooking up.</p><p>The company is no stranger to this world, since it already builds small solar and battery sets for off-road types. But it’s pleasing to see it also entering the home battery market which, Tesla aside, is full of companies that don’t have as big a presence in the consumer space. It’s also heartening to see Anker building gear for smaller setups, like apartments, where sometimes the only thing you can do to clean up your energy is hang a solar panel off your balcony.</p><p>– Dan Cooper</p><p><em>The Morning After isn’t just a</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/"><em> newsletter</em></a><em> –  it’s also a daily podcast.

<p>Fujifilm's line of instant cameras has grown again with the launch of the <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/06/15/2688566/0/en/Fujifilm-Introduces-INSTAX-SQUARE-SQ40-Instant-Camera.html">Instax SQ40</a>. The  new model borrows retro cues from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fujfifilm-goes-full-retro-with-the-100-instax-mini-40-074008000.html">Mini 40</a>, while shooting larger-format square film like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-25-fujifilm-instax-square-sq20-instant-photos.html">previous SQ models</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike the shiny plastic square format models of the past, the SQ40 is wrapped in faux black leather with silver accents. It measures 5.25 inches wide by 4.5 inches tall by 2.25 inches thick, so it's considerably larger than the Mini 40 and other rectangular cameras. For easy carrying, it comes with a shoulder strap with quick release loops.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Fujfilm's Instax SQ40 marries retro charm with larger square film" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/93656c00-0b54-11ee-97bd-9ab2063604e8" style="height: 1741px; width: 2500px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Fujifilm/Cactus Images Limited</div></figure><p>The lens is retractable and has three modes, starting with the fully retracted &quot;off&quot; position that makes the camera relatively flat and closes the protective cap. In the &quot;on&quot; position, it extends and the lens cap opens, giving a field of view equivalent to 65.75 mm (35mm equivalent, presumably) for shooting no closer than 19.7 inches. And finally, there's a &quot;macro&quot; mode for selfies that lets you shoot between 11.8 and 19.7 inches, with a small mirror at the front so you can see yourself and friends.&nbsp;</p><p>It has automatic exposure and shoots on the Instax Square frame to a 2.4- by 2.4-inch image area on a 3.4- by 2.8-inch film size. Unlike some Instax models, there doesn't appear to be any saving to a digital format, so this is about as analog as modern cameras get.</p><figure><img alt="Fujfilm's Instax SQ40 marries retro charm with larger square film" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/06a5a9f0-0b55-11ee-bf7b-9fd89da6f12a" style="height: 967px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Fujifilm</div></figure><p>The SQ40 costs $150 and is expected to be available for purchase by the end of June 2023. The basic white-border version of the square film costs around $19 for 20 exposures, and a new version called Instax Square &quot;Sunset&quot; with pastel shaded borders (above) is $15.75 for a 10-pack. Finally, Fujifilm released a new brown colorway for the Mini Evo priced at $200, also available at the end of June.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/fujfilms-instax-sq40-marries-retro-charm-with-larger-square-film-091047370.html?src=rss

As <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjODEzYWUzOS03ZDU4LTQxY2ItYWM2Ni1hZDgzMDYwNmNlZWYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNi8xNC90ZWNobm9sb2d5L2V1cm9wZS1haS1yZWd1bGF0aW9uLmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjQ3YzRkYTBmLTNmMDQtNDU3MS1iY2EwLWJjMzYyYmYxZTQxOSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAadO2iLBxc8LBm1TVOvM4CnO_KS8UxUCXfvNCbxaJvPU&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2023%2F06%2F14%2Ftechnology%2Feurope-ai-regulation.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a> notes, it's merely one part of a longer process, and the soonest we can see the final version of the law is most likely later this year. But if the law gets enforced in <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/society/20230601STO93804/eu-ai-act-first-regulation-on-artificial-intelligence">its current form</a>, then the European Union will be banning the use of real-time and remote biometric systems, such as facial recognition scanning.&nbsp;</p><p>It will also prohibit devices that exhibit cognitive behavioral manipulation, such as voice activated toys deemed to encourage dangerous behavior in children. Technologies that classify people based on their socio-economic status or personal characteristics will be banned, as well. Meanwhile, technologies considered "high risk" will need to be registered in an EU database. These include AI systems for biometric identification and those for use by law enforcement.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The European Commission first proposed the AI Act back in April 2021. That was way before the meteoric rise in popularity of generative AI systems, which led to a rise in calls for artificial intelligence to be regulated. The version the lawmakers have voted on included rules for generative AI companies like OpenAI, including requiring them to disclose any content generated by artificial intelligence. These companies will also be required to ensure that their large language models can't generate illegal content. Also, they will have to publish summaries of copyrighted data used to train their models.&nbsp;</p><p>Representatives from the European Parliament, the European Commission and the Council of the European Union still have to negotiate details for the final version of the law. They could decide to change some aspects of it and add certain exemptions, such as allowing the use of facial recognition for national security purposes. The AI Act would likely go through several iterations after this vote, though EU officials are hoping to finalize details by the end of the year.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/eu-officials-pass-draft-law-to-regulate-ai-and-ban-facial-recognition-systems-070056032.html?src=rss

<p>Feel like the Steam desktop client was long overdue for a major upgrade? So did Valve. Today the company <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N0b3JlLnN0ZWFtcG93ZXJlZC5jb20vbmV3cy9hcHAvNTkzMTEwL3ZpZXcvMzY4NzkzMTk2NTU5ODkwNjE4NCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZmFhMjViYmYtNDk2MC00YTAxLThjOGItMTBkMGIxYmQ3YjUwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAezb_cnwvHBs8TL8RlkE2-uFIUFNbTWqf5kJ5HkioYuL&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F593110%2Fview%2F3687931965598906184">released an update for the platform</a> that includes many of the features it has been testing in the app's beta channel. The latest client features updated fonts and menus, a revised notification system and a redesigned in-game overlay. Better still, Valve says the platform has been rebuilt with an all-new framework designed to help features ship simultaneously across all versions of Steam.</p><div id="d8657340333748259de7001141a938a7"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>That means some of the new features baked into the desktop client are also already available on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/steam-deck/">Steam Deck</a>. Specifically, Valve called out the client's overhauled in-game overlay — in addition to a new interface and more versatile toolbar, players also now have access to a new notes tool that syncs across PCs. Thanks to the new framework, this feature is now available on desktop and Steam Deck simultaneously. The overlay also has a new "pin" feature that will allow users to keep that notes tool (or any other window from the in-game interface) visible during gameplay.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Valve is also trying to clean up the client's notifications. Clicking on the icon should now only show the most recent and relevant notifications, and will prompt users to click through to see a full historical view. Users should see small updates across the rest of the client as well, including updated dialog text, new fonts and tweaked colors.</p><p>The new features are nice, but Valve seems most proud of the improvements its made under the hood. In addition to the new framework, the company says that its enabled hardware acceleration for Mac and Linux users, offering a smoother experience across all platforms.</p><p>Last, and perhaps least, the update may be the end of the legacy Steam Big Picture mode. Buried among the client's long list of bug fixes is a note that the command line option to enable "oldbigpicture" has been removed. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/valve-big-picture-steam-deck-114113851.html">We're all using the Steam Deck interface</a> now.</p><p>The new Steam Client update is available to download now.
