href=\"https://procoto.com\">https://procoto.com</a>] here. We\u2019re making running RFPs (requests for proposal from outside vendors), tracking contracts, and managing vendors simple and affordable. We get procurement teams out of dense systems and spreadsheets without having to drop a hefty check on SAP or Coupa.\nHow are we doing it? Check out our demo: <a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/27eba91688d34d958d5939e8da649ea5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.loom.com/share/27eba91688d34d958d5939e8da649ea5</a><p>We\u2019re giving procurement teams of any size an easier way to invite vendors, consolidate submissions, and analyze the offers. When a winner is selected, contract terms are digitized and stored in Procoto too. All vendor info, both for winners and non, exist in the vendor library for future bidding events and negotiating.<p>Our early customers are using Procoto to get better rates on everything from raw materials and ingredients to cleaning services and contractors.<p>Why us? We built procurement organizations at a couple startups and have used 30+ of our competitors\u2019 software. We lived the pain we\u2019re solving for years and finally left to build the solution we couldn\u2019t find\u2026 Something self-service, customizable, with UI/UX from this decade, and built for users without supply chain degrees.<p>We previously launched on here [<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26357292\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26357292</a>] and got (justifiably) roasted for not actually catering to the small and mid-sized businesses we claimed to be. Highlights included no pricing on the site and a complete sales led go-to-market.<p>Shoutout to the HN community. We really needed to hear it and we\u2019re a better product now because of it.<p>So now we\u2019re launching our self-service model. Pricing is on the site, self-guided signup, and there\u2019s a 2-week trial to test it out.<p>Would love to hear what you think of the new-and-improved version. Your feedback meant a lot the first time around.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a

I am an engineer with 20 years in, working mostly on web development. I have a pretty high salary in the top %5 band of my area and sector.<p>I don't know where to start this. So let's just jump right into it.<p>I can't tell what will happen immediately next year. This has never happened to me before professionally. I was born a nerd, started programming early, and jobs just came to me.<p>AI scares me for job security. My entire pitch to get to top %5 of salary band has been that I have many years of experience in my specialty. Thus securing me high roles in my field along with high salary.<p>I have been already working nearly at a burn-out level for many years to reach this comp.<p>Rent is sky high. I don't feel comfortable taking on mortgage despite having multiples of needed deposit, because I am not sure how much longer I can maintain my comp. with AI automating everything.<p>Many people share the comforting stories, that there will be other jobs for engineers/programmers.<p>How am I supposed to retain my TC if I have to switch to another field from web?<p>I am unable to enjoy any content, movie, tv show anymore. Even the SciFi from last year, feels outdated. Reddit comments feel like they're all AI-generated. I made an AI reddit bot myself. None noticed.<p>I use ChatGPT on a daily basis to build projects, and the more I use it, the more scared I get. It is just too powerful. The more I use it, the less proud I feel for my output. It just feels like anyone could do it.<p>Where are we really going? Can we just stop the optimistic techie talk and accept UBI is not happening... They don't give you healthcare, do you think they will give you CASH like that???<p>I hope this doesn't get flagged, because I really need your inputs.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a

transferred all my Yahoo Mail emails there to save them for posterity. Once in a blue moon I would log in, reminisce over 20+ year old messages and attachments, and move on. I did just that in June 2021, except this time it triggered some suspicious activity flag and that account got locked. Unfortunately (lesson learned!) I did not associate any recovery information with this address, so Google basically refused to let me back in, despite the valid password. I tried every suggestion I came upon - resurrected old phones and laptops, attempted logging in in the same geographical area that I used to live in, etc - nothing worked. Eventually I came to terms with the idea that those memories are forever lost, behind Google's unresponsiveness.<p>Every few months I tried logging in, without any expectations or success. Except today it worked! Logged from an incognito window and during the recovery process got asked for a phone number. And then I was in (and as a first step fixed the backup info). I can't help but notice that almost exactly two years have passed since the lockout. Don't know if there is significance there, but just wanted to share with folks that there might still be some hope. Too many stories of locked out Google accounts with zero transparency or follow-up possibility from the company.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36335975\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36335975</a></p>\n<p>Points: 21</p>\n<p># Comments: 4</p>", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36335975", "date_published": "2023-06-15 03:11:35+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Drugs like ritalin, dexamphetamine decrease the quality of cognitive effort", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.add4165\">https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.add4165</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36335730\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36335730</a></p>\n<p>Points: 18</p>\n<p># Comments: 17</p>", "link": "https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.add4165", "date_published": "2023-06-15 02:31:58+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Show HN: FFmpeg UI", "description": "<p>A user interface to quickly and easily convert media files using FFMPEG behind the scenes.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36335674\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36335674</a></p>\n<p>Points: 19</p>\n<p># Comments: 15</p>", "link": "https://ybouane.com/ffmpeg-ui", "date_published": "2023-06-15 02:23:56+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Man found UC Berkeley skeleton in 2021", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.berkeleyscanner.com/2023/06/12/uc-berkeley-crime/uc-berkeley-skeleton-found-2021-clark-kerr-human-remains/\">https://www.berkeleyscanner.com/2023/06/12/uc-berkeley-crime/uc-berkeley-skeleton-found-2021-clark-kerr-human-remains/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36335581\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36335581</a></p>\n<p>Points: 20</p>\n<p># Comments: 3</p>", "link": "https://www.berkeleyscanner.com/2023/06/12/uc-berkeley-crime/uc-berkeley-skeleton-found-2021-clark-kerr-human-remains/", "date_published": "2023-06-15 02:11:17+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "The NVIDIA AI Red Team", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-ai-red-team-an-introduction/\">https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-ai-red-team-an-introduction/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36335374\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36335374</a></p>\n<p>Points: 10</p>\n<p># Comments: 15</p>", "link": "https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-ai-red-team-an-introduction/", "date_published": "2023-06-15 01:39:52+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "On the slow productivity of John Wick", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://calnewport.com/on-the-slow-productivity-of-john-wick/\">https://calnewport.com/on-the-slow-productivity-of-john-wick/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36335104\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36335104</a></p>\n<p>Points: 33</p>\n<p># Comments: 16</p>", "link": "https://calnewport.com/on-the-slow-productivity-of-john-wick/", "date_published": "2023-06-15 01:04:46+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "SETI Scientists to Devise Plan for Lunar Listening Station", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.supercluster.com/editorial/seti-scientists-to-devise-plan-for-lunar-listening-station/\">https://www.supercluster.com/editorial/seti-scientists-to-devise-plan-for-lunar-listening-station/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36334912\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36334912</a></p>\n<p>Points: 12</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "link": "https://www.supercluster.com/editorial/seti-scientists-to-devise-plan-for-lunar-listening-station/", "date_published": "2023-06-15 00:38:20+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "I am Steve Huffman, the new CEO of Reddit.
