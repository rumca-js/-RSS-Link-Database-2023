Temu has some really, really cheap stuff. Are the knock-off Apple accessories any good?

Temu is the Chinese shopping website that has taken the United States by storm. The prices are crazy. Too crazy. It's estimated Temu is burning in excess of $1 billion per year on loss leaders to break into the US market. It's a bold strategy, Cotton. Let's see how it plays out for them. I purchased a bunch of Apple knock-off accessories; from fake AirPods to an Apple Pencil. Shall we see if any counterfeit product is any good?
