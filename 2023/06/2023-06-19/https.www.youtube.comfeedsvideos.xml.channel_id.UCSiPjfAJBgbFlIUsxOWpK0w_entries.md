Such a tender moment between Jack and Swatty… #polyphoniccapability This is one of my favorite songs on the record actually 😊 It’s called “Félicitations” which means “Congratulations.” It’s about the idea of getting to the end of your life and actually feeling like you did it. Like you did everything you wanted to do. So…even though it sounds ironic, I think that the feeling of “I did it!” is something that can be practiced. I try to feel that way as often as possible. Because success is…in my opinion…truly just a feeling.
