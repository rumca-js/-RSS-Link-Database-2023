The feature highlights the unfortunately chequered development phase of Mortal Kombat: Special Forces, a year 2000 Playstation exclusive spinoff centring on tertiary character Major Jax, with gameplay a departure from the usual beat ‘em up fayre to something akin to action-adventure. The results were catastrophically underwhelming, with the game’s bland environments, boring story, and half-baked combat the headlines in a laundry list’s worth of flaws. 

The feature also describes the development team, whom during production jumped ship with studio Midway opting to replace them with a skeleton crew of under skilled developers rather than cancel the project outright. These events coalesced to a catastrophic degree, with Mortal Kombat: Special Forces tragically being one of the lowest rated games of all time despite a promising foundation of developmental talent and fantastical lore.

Park Beyond doesn’t stretch the limits of what a theme park builder and management sim can be, and it doesn’t necessarily stand toe to toe with the best of the best the genre has had to offer over the years, but for those looking for a solid new offering to sink dozens of hours of their lives into, you can’t go wrong with Limbic Entertainment and Bandai Namco’s newest release. 

From its solid fundamental gameplay ideas to the impressive degree of control it affords thanks to its suite of customization options to its delightful impossification mechanics, there’s plenty to enjoy in Park Beyond. Console players might have issues with the controls, and the game has a few technical deficiencies, but the overall package here is one that’s easy to recommend.
