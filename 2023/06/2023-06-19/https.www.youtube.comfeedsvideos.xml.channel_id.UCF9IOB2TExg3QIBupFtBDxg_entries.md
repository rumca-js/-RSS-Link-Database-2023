Conservative Campaign Headquarters, London

December 2020

Staffers working for recently honoured 'Lord Bailey' 

Dancing and joking about defying lockdown rules

At least 24 revellers

Two dancing officials, twirling each other past signs saying 'please keep your distance' 

Staff members heard laughing, hopes that they are not exposed for 'bending the rules.'

One man, 'Oh ******.'

'Are you filming this?' 

'Er, it's for the party use.'

A man then laughs after declaring: 'As long as we are not streaming that we're, like, bending the rules.'

One of those captured, Ben Mallett, a senior Tory aide, awarded an OBE

Michael Gove

‌“The decision to confer honours on people was one that was made by Boris Johnson as an outgoing prime minister. Outgoing prime ministers have that right,”

Reintroducing a tiered system (December 2020)

Questions

Were these people told things about the effectiveness (or lack of) of lockdowns the public were not told?

Were these people told things about the risks of infection (or lack of) to themselves the public were not told?

Were these people told things about anything else, and if so by whom?

Did seniors know about this party?
