## Australia could rue England’s tail wag as they face tough chase on final day | Geoff Lemon

<p>Excellent bowling by Pat Cummins was counteracted by allowing the tailenders to add 63 – and Labuschagne and Smith falling late</p><p>For most of the day, Pat Cummins under duress held things together. First it was in the face of Joe Root’s early onslaught, one that would have been withering not just for its rate of scoring but the cheerfully insouciant air with which it was carried out. England had piled on 49 runs in 39 balls before Cummins produced magic, the quintessential booming yorker that swung in at Vin Diesel pace and demolished Ollie Pope’s off stump. <br /><br />Root carried on with Harry Brook, at times making Cummins rejig the field every few balls, while also bowling a seven-over spell to start the day. Despite Brook laying into Nathan Lyon, Cummins backed his spinner and kept enough fielders up, letting Lyon dislodge both batters for 46 each.</p><p>So far so good, an on-field reflection of his pre-match words when asked about keeping cool if England reached the boil: “There’s going to be some moments of tension for everyone, which is exciting. You hopefully have a Plan A, Plan B, Plan C, and at times you just go on your gut. There’s going to be high pressure moments but you wouldn’t want to be anywhere else but out there in the middle of it.”<br /><br />He was in the middle constantly, as England kept swinging. And when he resumed bowling after lunch, he struck, some brilliance from around the wicket to nail Ben Stokes on the pad. England’s talisman of attacking cricket followed the exit of Jonny Bairstow, another for Lyon. England led by 217 with only the bottom four to hand.<br /><br />That’s where things went awry. Captaincy is a hard game, routinely judged in hindsight, but the bouncer-only plan to tailenders has failed enough times before that it can fairly be questioned in advance. Sure, Moeen Ali nailed a couple before gloving one to the keeper. But at times to follow, Ollie Robinson and even Stuart Broad had a ring of players on the boundary, waiting for a shot flapped their way. <br /><br />Runs were easy in singles. Fielders came up, dropped back. Cummins wore criticism for defensive fields on day one, but that had a tactical application against England’s aggressive top order. For No10 it was something else. Among the confusion, England added 63 runs after Stokes was out, including 44 from the stands between Broad, Robinson and James Anderson. It took the target from a comfortable 220 to a more challenging 281. <br /><br />Australia may yet run it down on the fifth day, three wickets down for 107 at stumps. If they do, it will be a significant effort. Recent years have seen a surge in large chases: Sri Lanka in Durban, West Indies in Chattogram, Pakistan in Galle. Several have been against Australia: England at Headingley, India in Brisbane, and earlier this century, the two highest chases ever of 418 and 414. What we haven’t seen is an Australian team doing any of the chasing. They’ve tended to win by a distance or lose by the same.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jun/19/australia-could-rue-englands-tail-wag-as-they-face-tough-chase-on-final-day">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘I have come for a sign of life’: relatives cling to hope after Greek shipwreck

## Australian higher education has expanded but elite universities still favour the privileged |  Michael Wesley

<p>Despite decades of government effort, the link between socioeconomic advantage and university wealth has persisted</p><p>Australia now has<strong> </strong>an opportunity to broaden access to university for disadvantaged groups in society. But, as we work towards an Australian universities accord at the end of this year, we<strong> </strong>face formidable obstacles. Over 50 years Australian governments have been trying to increase the number of disadvantaged Australians attending university with scant success. Even more galling, the general expansion in the number of Australians attending university has had the perverse effect of increasing, rather than decreasing, the stratification and inequalities within tertiary education.</p><p>Traditionally there have been two arguments in support of expanding access to university. One is that more tertiary-educated Australians will help expand and transition the economy; the other is that the economic and social mobility that university education brings should be open to all Australians.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/19/australian-higher-education-has-grown-but-elite-universities-still-favour-the-privileged">Continue reading...</a>
