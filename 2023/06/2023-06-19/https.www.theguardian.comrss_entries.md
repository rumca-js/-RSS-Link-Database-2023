## Note to Labour: energy transition isn’t just about power generation

<p>There are some doubts as to whether Starmer’s publicly-owned energy company will have its emphasis in the right place</p><p>A Labour government would establish a new publicly-owned energy generation company in Scotland, Keir Starmer announced on Monday. Fine, if expertise and jobs from the North Sea industry are to be transferred over time, Scotland is a logical place to put it. But the location is only a minor piece of the decision-making. Two more important questions about “Great British Energy” are these: how much money will it have to invest? And which investments would it prioritise?</p><p>There is – as yet – no hint of an answer to the first question, perhaps understandably if a general election is still more than a year away. But note that many outsiders think GBE would need an annual investment budget of £5bn-£10bn to make a meaningful difference to the pace of energy transition. Clarity can’t wait for ever.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/jun/20/note-to-labour-energy-transition-isnt-just-about-power-generation">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The blind comedian pairs up with comics like Harry Hill to work out if the tourist trail can offer any pleasures to those who can’t see the big attractions – or the point of going anywhere</p><p>It is a rite of passage for any successful TV comedian: pen a hit fringe show, do Live at the Apollo, host Live at the Apollo, and then, if the comedy gods permit, appear in a travelogue with another famous comedian, that’s to say, a holiday you wouldn’t choose to go on but will get paid to joke about.

Wonders of the World I Can’t See pairs him with four celebrity companions to see if they can persuade him that travelling is worth the effort. “When it comes to sightseeing, I can’t be arsed,” he says. “I’m blind, so what’s the point?”</p><p>He starts his odyssey with Harry Hill, who takes him to Athens for a week with the intention of experiencing the Acropolis in all its glory. McCausland admits early on that he likes neither heat nor flying.

This Euro 2024 qualifying tie was only in the 51st minute but the England winger had completed a stunning hat-trick and so why wait for the traditional post-match ritual? The only problem for Saka – and North Macedonia – was that he had to hand it back. For a while, at least.</p><p>The strange thing about this game was that England had rather laboured for the opening 29 minutes. It felt as if it could turn into one of those long nights. The way that they set about the notion and dismantled it, together with the opposition, said everything about the poise and belief that Gareth Southgate has instilled.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/19/england-north-macedonia-euro-2024-qualifier-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With his methodical batting on day four, did we witness the logical next step for Bazball? Hello conventional Test cricket</p><p>Ben Stokes walks to the wicket slowly. This is pretty much the only thing he does slowly these days. Harry Brook tries to say a few words to him as he arrives, but Stokes isn’t really listening. There’s a little poke and a nudge of the pitch, dust and debris swept away with a swish of his bat, a kind of purification ritual, like a sumo sanctifying the dohyo. He takes his time, makes us wait, makes us watch: a man who has long since made his peace with the gaze of others. This is his turf, his team, his time, and there is a certain theatrical flourish to the way he stretches out the moment for all it is worth.</p><p>There is a frisson around the ground, and of course there always was when Stokes walked in to bat, but ever since he became captain and began to mould this team in his image he has also batted with the expectation of leadership. With the knowledge that his teammates on the dressing‑room balcony are taking their cue from him, that an entire playing philosophy has been built around his approach. These days when Stokes bats we don’t simply demand to be entertained, but enlightened. We want him to set an example. We want him to blaze the righteous path to truth, ideally by smashing it as hard as possible as soon as possible.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jun/19/stokes-the-captain-is-a-fine-thing-but-soon-england-will-need-stokes-the-player-again-ashes">Continue reading...</a>

They paid Mohammad £10 a game to play, which, like the 209 Middlesex made off their 40 overs, felt a lot more back then than it sounds now.</p><p>Fred Titmus was bowling, and <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/print/how-history-s-first-reverse-sweep-passed-the/">Mohammad says he was wondering</a> where, exactly, his next run was going to come from. “So I looked around and realised that the only gap was at third man.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jun/19/joe-root-takes-pleasure-in-the-reverse-sweep-cricket-ashes">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Recruitment and retention problems are harming children’s learning. Ministers  have failed to act</p><p>A staffing crisis in English schools that has been building for a decade shows no sign of easing. The number of vacant posts increased by 44% between 2021 and 2022. One in four new teachers leaves the profession within three years. The headteacher of one secondary school describes trying to fill some roles as “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jun/17/trying-to-find-a-maths-or-science-teacher-is-like-looking-for-a-unicorn-inside-english-schools-recruitment-crisis" title="">advertising for a unicorn</a>”. Even in English, where recruitment has traditionally been easier than in maths or science – where schools face competition from higher-paying private sector employers – there are shortages. Growing numbers of pupils are taught by staff without expertise in the subject.</p><p>This should be a source of profound concern, and also shame, in government. It is ministers’ job to oversee state schools. They are responsible for a situation in which becoming and remaining a teacher have become less attractive. Gillian Keegan is the seventh education secretary in five years. It does not appear that any of them have grasped the problem. Without teachers, teaching cannot take place. The difficulties are most severe in disadvantaged schools and areas, meaning that attainment gaps can be expected to increase.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/19/the-guardian-view-on-teacher-shortages-pay-must-go-up-and-workload-down">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Reforming the House of Lords should begin by constraining a departing leader’s power to dish out lifetime awards to friends and cronies</p><p>When handing out lifetime honours, Boris Johnson’s guiding principle has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/dec/22/pm-rejects-official-advice-in-awarding-peter-cruddas-peerage" title="">brazen cronyism and snubbing established convention</a>. But the most recent revelations, on the eve of MPs debating the privileges committee report into Mr Johnson’s deceit over Partygate, are jaw-dropping. On Sunday, a video emerged of Conservative staffers enjoying a 2020 Christmas <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-65952298" title="">“jingle and mingle”</a> jamboree that patently broke lockdown rules.

Mr Johnson does not. By waving through the list, Rishi Sunak appears either to agree with his disgraced predecessor or to be too weak to stop it. The government says it was respecting “<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-65941549" title="">due process</a>” – as prime ministers routinely rubber stamp those appointments <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2023/06/11/boris-johnson-honours-list-eight-picks-blocked-holac/" title="">approved</a> by peers. But Mr Johnson did not respect such norms. The manner of his departure – convicted by parliament’s highest court of lying – is unprecedented. The current prime minister is <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-65876723" title="">responsible</a> for recommending honours. Mr Sunak would have been justified in refusing Mr Johnson’s list.

One of Britain’s leading architects admired for the Mound stand at Lord’s, Westminster tube station and the 2012 Olympic velodrome<p>The architect Sir Michael Hopkins, who has died aged 88, occupied a special place in a much abused profession.

Hopkins gave modern architecture a human face.</p><p>At the start of his career, he seemed inextricably linked to the young turks of high tech, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/dec/19/richard-rogers-lord-rogers-obituary" title="">Richard Rogers</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/03/lord-norman-foster-i-still-get-the-same-buzz-from-designing-buildings-" title="">Norman Foster</a>, designing steel-frame buildings of immaculate precision. From the late 1960s, Hopkins spent eight productive years in partnership with Foster. The <a href="https://www.fosterandpartners.com/projects/willis-building" title="">Willis Faber and Dumas</a> headquarters in Ipswich, Suffolk, was the peak of their collaboration. But his later architecture took a different and more original direction as he became more concerned with the history of building and the place of architecture in the landscape. This growing sense of context brought his buildings a new richness, a poetic modernity rooted in his understanding of the past.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/19/sir-michael-hopkins-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The pandemic showed us how digital divides worsen inequality - this  project shows they’re not inevitable</p><p>Digital poverty and exclusion hide in plain sight. In an era of hyper-connectivity, millions are left in the shadows, even in the wealthiest countries. Data from the US shows that a quarter of America’s rural population, a staggering 14.5 million people, still don’t have access to broadband. In a world where billions are connected, the stark reality of this absence looms large, leaving more than 3 billion people on the margins of the digital age. As life moves online, it only exacerbates existing inequalities, limiting access to education, healthcare, job opportunities and essential services.</p><p>This takes us to Kerala in south India, home to about 34 million people. There, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/21/kerala-indian-state-flattened-coronavirus-curve">communist-led state government</a> is launching something called the Kerala Fibre Optical Network (KFON) – and it’s a major milestone. (It is worth noting the irony that the communist government, which has a history of opposing the introduction of computers, is now at the forefront of this digital initiative.) In 2016, the state recognised the internet as a basic citizen’s right, joining other polities like Finland, Costa Rica and France. Next on the agenda: making this new right mean something.</p><p>Oommen C Kurian leads the health initiative at the Observer Research Foundation, a thinktank based in New Delhi</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/19/kerala-free-broadband-india">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In six decades in showbiz, he has been murdered by Screaming Lord Sutch, played the lead in Hair, had hit singles and a hit sitcom – and surprised Serge Gainsbourg</p><p>When he was starting out as a young man in bands in the early 60s, Paul Nicholas could only have dreamed that he would still be working more than 60 years on. He is now nearing the end of a seven-month theatre tour. It must be tiring by this stage, I suggest. But no, he says. “It’s really the one thing that I enjoy doing more than anything. Performing on stage is kind of a release for me.” He smiles. “It sounds a bit heavy, doesn’t it?”</p><p>Nicholas is about to release the audio version of the memoir he wrote during lockdown, which covers his career from failed rock singer to successful pop star, from being the first actor to play the lead in Jesus Christ Superstar to being part of the original cast of Cats, appearing in numerous films including the cult hit Tommy and the 80s BBC sitcom Just Good Friends. In recent years, Nicholas has appeared in EastEnders and the reality show version of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, among others.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jun/19/if-you-have-dreams-follow-them-paul-nicholas-on-bowie-the-bee-gees-playing-jesus-and-ruffling-the-kings-hair">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The latest partygate video shows such a toe-curlingly bad effort at having a good time it’s enough to put you off for life</p><p>So, you’re working for Shaun Bailey, in the middle of a pandemic, the nation’s in lockdown, and you’re in a strip-lit office watching a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/18/covid-bereaved-families-disgust-tory-hq-party-video-met-police-consider-footage">guy in a Christmas jumper crash into a table like a concussed bull</a>, while epic self-love surges across his face and you can see him thinking: “My dancing is on fire; maybe it’s time to take this to competition level.” Across from him, there is a young man in red braces, his eyes beseeching the room to join him in joyful halloo at how hilarious he is. At what point do you think: “I really need a video of this solid-gold moment”? I’m glad I’ve seen it, because it is so fascinatingly terrible, yet at the same time, I wish I hadn’t, because you get too close to Tories doing a thing, and it immediately puts you off the thing. They haven’t just made themselves look bad, they’ve made parties look awful.</p><p>Boris Johnson ruined cake. It wasn’t a single act, but an accumulation: he deployed it first as aphorism – a “<a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2020/02/13/having-cake-and-eating-it-how-a-hyperbolic-metaphor-framed-brexit/">having cake and eating it</a>” person; then as excuse – he wasn’t having a party, he was merely eating cake; then, I believe, as an attempt to humanise himself – he was given cake, because it was his birthday.

<p>All six runners on the opening day are single-figure odds and the potential is there to bring the bookmakers to their knees</p><p>It is possible to pinpoint with a considerable degree of accuracy the moment when Britain’s bookmaking industry last faced the possibility of a truly ruinous day at the races. At 5.05pm (and 22 seconds) on 20 June 2019, the 28-strong field in the Britannia Handicap at Royal Ascot was approaching the furlong pole and Turgenev, who had set off as the 7-2 favourite, was going strongly in front with a lead of nearly three lengths and trading at around 1-3 in-running on Betfair.</p><p>At that instant, Frankie Dettori, Turgenev’s rider, had already won the first four races on the card, at odds of 5-1, 13-2, 4-1 and evens. Victory No 5 on the day would have completed a 2,024-1 accumulator at SP, with many of Dettori’s loyal followers having banked much bigger prices earlier in the day. Just 12 seconds later, though, the bookmakers could breathe again, as Harry Bentley and Biometric emerged from the pack to chase them down and win by a length-and-a-quarter.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/19/frankie-dettori-rides-into-final-royal-ascot-with-bookies-on-high-alert-horse-racing">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Black Mirror had become a grim, horrid dud … until Brooker used the new season to lash out at his bankrollers like a petulant child. Is this the ultimate act of self-sabotage? </p><p>A few weeks into the pandemic, Charlie Brooker didn’t know what to do with Black Mirror. “At the moment I don’t know what stomach there would be for stories about societies falling apart, so I’m not working away on one of those,” he told the Radio Times in May 2020. “I’m sort of keen to revisit my comic skill set, so I’ve been writing scripts aimed at making myself laugh.”</p><p>It’s weird to think that the pandemic came at exactly the right time for Black Mirror. 2019’s three-episode season five was a near-unanimous dud; a pointlessly grim Black-Mirror-by-numbers exercise, overwrought and overacted, that went through the motions so wearily that it felt like the end of something. The good news, then, is that Brooker was able to fully reboot what Black Mirror is during his time away. The less good news is that he probably didn’t reboot it enough.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/19/black-mirror-charlie-brooker-is-trolling-netflix-and-its-breathtaking">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘People want the healing power’: Master Musicians of Joujouka, the mystical Moroccans opening Glastonbury

<p>Playing trance-inducing music that has existed for centuries, the Master Musicians invite us to rural Morocco to experience it up close – complete with gods in goat skins</p><p>It’s two in the morning in the little village of Joujouka in the Ahl Srif mountains of Morocco, and surely the oldest and loudest acoustic band on the planet are celebrating the god Pan – who still holds sway here, in an uneasy alliance with Islam – while also warming up for Glastonbury, where they will open the Pyramid stage this weekend.</p><p>There’s a full moon over the olive grove where the <a href="http://www.joujouka.org/">Master Musicians</a> have cut out a flat area as a stage, and tonight it is covered in carpets beneath a green and red patterned awning. The musicians are dressed in turbans and black embroidered <em>djellaba</em> robes, and all are seated apart from their elected leader, Ahmed El Attar, a drummer who parades in before them, driving on an intricate, improvised and trance-inducing dance music that continues without stop for hour after hour. This ancient artistry, stretching back over a thousand years, is powerful and complex; the musicians say it is spiritual, bringing a blessing, <em>baraka</em>, to those who listen.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/19/people-want-the-healing-power-master-musicians-of-joujouka-the-mystical-moroccans-opening-glastonbury">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Luxury leather bags inspired by Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s character in the new Dial of Destiny movie are the latest collaboration between fashion and film – but this time fans can fawn over Indy discreetly</p><p>The latest, and hopefully last, Indiana Jones film is released this month. It isn’t a spoiler to say that it probably won’t end up occupying the same cultural territory as Raiders of the Lost Ark, but then again what could? Still, it isn’t a bad film. It contains some digital de-ageing that’s almost convincing, a big twist at the end that feels specifically designed to make the crankiest corners of the internet choke to death on its popcorn and – most importantly – Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s character carries a bag around for some of the film.</p><p>No, really, that’s important. When the dust has settled on the Indiana Jones series, everyone will remember the key pieces of its iconography. When future generations come to watch Indiana Jones, they will instantly picture Jones’s hat and whip, and also the bag that Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s character carries around for some of the last film.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/19/does-the-world-really-need-a-4650-indiana-jones-bag-phoebe-waller-bridge-dial-of-destiny">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Decent family entertainment set in the city of four elements, with a message of acceptance in bricks of colour and concepts as if originated via algorithm</p><p>Here is a perfectly decent, personable family entertainment from Pixar, based around another of this studio’s oddly pedantic and algorithmically developed abstract high concepts: what if fire and water fell in love? It is also a star-crossed love story based on that most traditional of American themes: melting-pot diversity in the big city.</p><p>The scene is another fabular alt-reality: Element City, a place of vivid colours and shapes like a toy held up in front of a newborn. Here, the creatures of the four elements – fire, water, earth and air – have come together to live, if not in harmony exactly, then a kind of boisterous acceptance. There is, however, a bigoted caste system that means that fire creatures are looked down on, maybe in the way the US’s northern European identities look down on people from hotter countries.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/19/elemental-review-fire-and-water-fall-in-love-in-multicoloured-unworldly-pixar-fable">Continue reading...</a>

All three have revealed a fine understanding of the complexities of Strauss’s music and dramaturgy. His Ariadne, however, is more radical than its predecessors, a considered, if at times drastic rethink of an ambivalent even problematic work.</p><p>Ravella strips the opera of its familiar associations with the baroque, either in the original 18th-century setting or the ornate profusion that most directors bring to it. In their place is something altogether more stark and austere. <a href="https://www.eno.org/artists/giles-cadle/">Designer Giles Cadle</a> simple set of staircases and platforms initially frame the backstage doors and rooms for the Prologue, but are later transformed by Malcolm Rippeth’s lighting into a disquieting, <a href="https://mcescher.com/">Escher</a>-type labyrinth – Naxos as an island of the mind where <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/mar/21/lockdown-one-year-on-soprano-natalya-romaniw-madam-butterfly-eno-english-national-opera">Natalya Romaniw</a>’s Ariadne is effectively imprisoned by her own loneliness.

Except that he pretended to construct and author this raw slice of reality. Over the black and white footage you hear Smith barking out commands like a director. “I want the man in the white boiler suit to come in from the left!” It’s funny and thought-provoking: what is is art, if not a moment in which we frame all the stuff going on in the world, and see it as if we were part of a vast fiction?</p><p>Smith’s work forms part of<a href="https://www.whitechapelgallery.org/life-is-more-important-than-art/"> the first exhibition at the Whitechapel Gallery in London </a>under its new director, <a href="https://www.gilanetawadros.org/">Gilane Tawadros</a>.

<p>Film-maker Neary Adeline Hay retraces her mother’s escape from her homeland in this poignant family history and memory piece</p><p></p><p>With echoes of her <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/aug/09/angkar-review-sublime-documentary-contends-with-legacy-of-khmer-rouge">sublime debut Angkar</a>, which grappled with the horrors of the Pol Pot regime through her father’s perspective as he returned to Cambodia after a 40-year absence, Neary Adeline Hay’s new documentary is a moving companion piece. Taking on the slippery nature of memory, Eskape revisits the dangerous journey taken by her mother, Thany Lieng, who fled Cambodia for France. As Hay retraces Thany’s footsteps, footage from her trip is entwined with her mother’s recollections, creating a rich and poignant tapestry of familial history.</p><p>While Hay’s presence in Angkar took the form of a voiceover, in Eskape the camera often lingers on her from behind, as she gazes at the various places once passed by her mother – suggesting that Hay is simultaneously a part of and distanced from this history. As a baby, she was with Thany as they made the perilous trek to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khao-I-Dang">Khao-I-Dang</a>, a refugee camp known as the “hill of death” on the border of Cambodia and Thailand. Hay’s memories only begin, however, when her family finally arrived in the south of France. A reluctant Thany recounts her ordeal in matter-of-fact and practical details. Compared to Hay, who yearns to learn more about her origins, Thany has the mindset of a survivor and is reluctant to disturb the ghosts of the past.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/19/eskape-review-neary-adeline-hay-cambodia-documentary">Continue reading...</a>

## Rachel Roddy’s recipe for stuffed aubergines | A kitchen in Rome

<p>Two stuffings in each aubergine, actually: first, the scooped-out flesh mixed with tomato, capers and anchovies, and the second made from breadcrumbs whizzed with tomato, herbs and olive oil</p><p>An aubergine hangs above my desk; it is on a tablecloth that looks like a latticed jam tart, beside a plate of pasta, a pair of binoculars and the sea, from which two tiny figures wave. There is also a hot dog, an apricot, the start of a letter and a glass filled with red and pink that could be Campari or cherry. It is a print by the Sicilian artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/liafiore/?hl=en">Lia Fiore</a>; a psychedelic, summer daydream that provides me with an ideal escape at least once a day, and often reminds me that I’m hungry, for pasta, or for aubergine with plenty of salt and oil. Fortunately, there are aubergines in the kitchen, too – Vincenzo calls them the keenest vegetable, ready to soak up anything you give them.</p><p>Advice is mixed when it comes to salting. In the past, aubergines were inherently bitter, and salting was a way of breaking down the cells in order to draw out that bitterness in the form of drops. There is another effect, too: apparently, less water means less oil is absorbed in the subsequent cooking, which is why, even with modern varieties carefully bred to be sweeter and free from excessive bitterness, salting is sometimes suggested. Although not by me, because I think the amount is negligible, plus I always fry or bake them in good-tasting olive oil. Astringency, though, the puckering kind, is often an issue with very young or mature fruit that has done time in cold storage. So, when faced with those (and if I have time), I sprinkle the slices with coarse salt and leave them to sit for 30 minutes, before brushing off any water droplets and salt and blotting them dry. Another benefit of salting is that, even when the coarse salt is brushed away, some seasoning is left.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/19/stuffed-aubergine-recipe-rachel-roddy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For too long Berlin focused national guilt for Nazi war crimes on rebuilding bridges with Moscow – at the expense of the rest of eastern Europe</p><p>Under the veneer of western unity in support of Ukraine, reactions to the war across Europe have been informed by different countries’ readings of their own history, of earlier conflicts on this continent, and by their conceptions of Russia’s national character. There is no automatic consensus within democratic societies about the lessons of the past, nor should there be. Remembrance is often selective, and the way ahead involves a discussion about what went wrong before.</p><p>Nowhere has this process of revisiting the past in search of the right decisions for the future been more fraught since the Russian invasion than in Germany. Over the past 16 months, the country has ended its heavy dependence on Russian oil and gas, abandoned its reluctance to send weapons to the war zone, and turned into one of Ukraine’s most important military and financial backers after the US. <a href="https://www.bpb.de/themen/europa/russland-analysen/nr-437/521589/umfragen-die-haltung-der-deutschen-bevoelkerung-zum-krieg-gegen-die-ukraine-waffen-sanktionen-diplomatie/">Most Germans</a> now support this policy shift – or <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeitenwende_speech">Zeitenwende</a></em> (turning point) as Chancellor Olaf Scholz terms it – but<strong> </strong>public debate about the future of Germany’s security policy has not stopped.

## ‘She doesn’t have the power’: Central Park birdwatcher Christian Cooper on why racist ‘incident’ won’t define him

<p>A white woman made a threat against Cooper in 2020, and the world took notice. Now he wants to share the joy of ‘birding while Black’</p><p>It is 7.57am on a Monday morning. I see Christian Cooper sitting with perfect posture on a bench right at the entrance of Central Park at West 103rd street.<strong> </strong>His first question for me is: have I brought any binoculars? I don’t own a pair, I admit. No worries, he says. If we spot anything, he’ll lend me his. That’s the most important birding tip I learned from his new book: you spot movement in the sky, with your naked eye first, <em>then </em>you raise your binoculars, not the other way around. Cooper is joyous when he tells me this. “If the book does nothing else but teach people how to use binoculars so they can actually see the birds, mission accomplished,” he says.</p><p>The book, Better Living Through Birding, is Cooper’s first memoir. It traces his journey from his childhood as a nerdy kid from Long Island, to his time as a comic book editor, to his birding days in Central Park. While doing so it weaves the history of Black people in America – from slavery and lynchings to segregation and economic disparity – into the unfolding of his life.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/19/christian-cooper-central-park-birdwatcher-racism">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Three decades on from her US Top 3 moment and weathering the loss of her parents, the singer explains how she has carved out a space for herself to be whatever she wants</p><p>Meshell Ndegeocello may have helped to kickstart the neo-soul movement in the 1990s, which introduced the world to D’Angelo and Erykah Badu, but to call her a soul singer would undermine her tastes, which are as wide as her discography is long. Speaking to me via a video call from her Brooklyn studio, where she dons all-black clothing against a backdrop of synthesisers and electronic rigs, Ndegeocello namechecks a cavalcade of faves: Broadway musicals, the classic sci-fi film Soylent Green, cult rapper Pink Siifu and young singer-songwriter Kara Jackson. The 54-year-old approaches magnetic new artists the same way that she did when she was a teenager gigging around her native Washington, DC – by learning the bass guitar parts to each of their songs. “If she needs a bass player, she should call me,” Ndegeocello quips about Jackson, “’Cause I already know it.”</p><p>After hitting the US Top 3 with a John Mellencamp duet in 1994, Ndegeocello has maintained a quieter but consistently surprising presence in music, transcending the slow-burning soul of her debut LP Plantation Lullabies<em> </em>and its brilliant 1996 follow-up Peace Beyond Passion to try a slew of styles – among them rap, jazz, psychedelia and heart-on-sleeve rock. (The latter for 1999 masterpiece Bitter.) From the get-go she was outspoken about her queerness, unlike many musicians of her generation. Her 2018 album Ventriloquism, a covers collection shaded by the death of her parents, featured an inverted pink triangle on its sleeve: the symbol the Nazis forced gay men to wear. Ndegeocello turned this terrible emblem into a sign of solidarity tinged with Trump-era fear, though in her case sexuality means something more interior than political.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/19/meshell-ndegeocello-making-music-is-the-rare-moment-that-i-feel-raceless-and-genderless">Continue reading...</a>

Most of my friends went for the ubiquitous Quickshot II, a great hulking giant of a controller, designed to resemble a fighter jet joystick, complete with multiple fire buttons and an autofire switch so that you could cheat on R-Type. It was reasonably delicate, though, so a session with a joystic-waggling sports game such as Daley Thompson’s Decathlon could see over-enthusiastic players wrenching the shaft clean off – surely the most Freudian mishap ever to befall a schoolboy.</p><p>When I <a href="https://twitter.com/keefstuart/status/1666141917392912384">asked Twitter users</a> for their favourite ever joysticks, the Quickshot got many mentions but so did the Super Pro Zip Stik and the pastel-coloured Powerplay Cruiser, both rugged, dependable stars of the Amiga era. More eccentric designs were also recalled – the squat little Cheetah Bug, the Konix Speedking (also known as the Epyx 500XJ), an ergonomic oddity designed to sit in the palm with the fire buttons on the side.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jun/19/remember-the-quickshot-why-its-worth-rediscovering-the-joy-of-joysticks">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When I was told I could reap huge health benefits by learning to walk better, I was sceptical. I was already pretty good at walking, I thought. It turned out I had a lot to learn</p><p>In all the time I spent with Joanna Hall, she barely stopped walking. I would see her coming towards me in Kensington Gardens, London, gliding past the other strollers as if she alone were on a moving walkway. When she reached me, I would fall into step and off we would walk, for an hour. At the end, Hall would stride into the distance and keep walking, for all I knew, until we met the following week.</p><p>Hall’s WalkActive system, a comprehensive fitness programme based around walking, aims to improve posture, increase speed, reduce stress on joints and deliver fitness, turning a stroll into a workout and changing the way you walk for ever. She says she can teach it to me, and we have set aside four weeks for my education.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/19/im-not-just-faster-but-taller-how-i-learned-to-walk-properly-and-changed-my-pace-posture-and-perspective">Continue reading...</a>

## Ancient Britons built Stonehenge – then vanished. Is science closing in on their killers? | Jonathan Kennedy

<p>New clues from an ancient plague are pushing us to rethink where Britons were ‘really’ from – and the answer is complicated</p><p>Two weeks ago, Pooja Swali from the Crick Institute announced the discovery of <em>Yersinia pestis</em>, the bacteria that causes plague, in the dental pulp of three people who died about 4,000 years ago – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/may/30/oldest-evidence-of-plague-in-britain-found-in-4000-year-old-human-remains">two in Somerset and the other in Cumbria</a>. This finding is astonishing in its own right because it pushes back the earliest evidence of plague in England by several millennia. But the discovery may also help to solve one of our greatest prehistoric mysteries: why did the people who introduced farming to the British Isles suddenly vanish shortly after they built Stonehenge some five millennia ago?</p><p>Before last week’s announcement, the oldest evidence of plague in Britain came from a 1,500-year-old skeleton interred at an Anglo-Saxon burial site near Cambridge. That victim died during the plague of Justinian, which spread throughout the eastern Roman empire and beyond in the middle of the sixth century. While scientists have identified plague DNA in human remains across Europe and Asia dating to between 5,000 and 2,500 years ago, until last week, we couldn’t be sure that this prehistoric pandemic reached these isles. It’s now clear that it did.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/19/ancient-britons-stonehenge-killers-plague-britain-migration">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Using two time frames, this engrossing book flits between three modern<em> </em>admirers of the groundbreaking artist and the man himself wandering Europe</p><p>Three people meet at a life-drawing class somewhere in London, each hoping to find solace and calm behind their easels, and they become unlikely friends. Arturo, a longstanding Argentinian exile, is still coming to terms with the terrible things he saw during the days of the junta. Sarah, an architect and soon-to-be-grandmother, is struggling with her Christian faith and the consequences of a broken friendship. Fred, who works for HM Revenue and Customs, fears he may be about to lose his job, the victim of a cover-up over a company tax evasion. But in Oscar Zarate’s hefty and involving new graphic novel, it isn’t their worries that bond this trio so much as their newfound enthusiasm for the 18th-century watercolourist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/jul/02/artsfeatures.tatebritain">Thomas Girtin</a>. Over dinner at one another’s houses, they’re soon talking of little else.</p><p>Such passion may be traced back originally to Fred, for it was he who first found himself spellbound by Girtin’s uncommon talent, beguiled by how relatively little is known about the artist, and frustrated that so much of his work is hidden from public view; his enthusiasm was catching. Girtin, a friend and rival of J M W Turner, died in 1802 at the aged of just 27, and there are those who believe that had he grown old, he would have become the greater artist of the two, a conviction Turner may have shared. “Had poor Tom lived, I would have starved,” Turner is supposed to have said after Girtin’s untimely death (the result, probably, of an asthma attack). Turner is known particularly to have admired Girtin’s exquisite and widely celebrated <em>The White House at Chelsea</em> (1800), a picture now in the collection of Tate Britain, where it can be seen only by appointment.</p><p><em>Thomas Girtin: The Forgotten Painter</em> by Oscar Zarate is published by SelfMadeHero (£34.99).

Jiminez’s Connection star Jean Dujardin oversees the hunt, calling his wife to say “Give the kids my love” before five solid days of barking at suspects and pointing at maps.</p><p>Deploying the standard Jason Bourne vocabulary of swish-pans, shaky-cam and jittery editing, the film mercifully avoids restaging the attacks themselves and instead catalogues the surveillance operations, false leads, interrogations and high-speed pursuits. Despite reliable work from a wiry-looking Jérémie Renier as a scowling cop and Anaïs Demoustier as a novice agent, we don’t get to know much about these (fictional) heroes who are pulling pizza-and-Alka-Seltzer all-nighters. A gun-runner (Hugo Dillon) with a colourful if dubious defence – “Don’t blame my Kalashnikovs, blame pussy politicians!” he fumes – comes more sharply into focus than anyone else here.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/19/november-review-replay-of-bataclan-terror-response-is-good-pr-for-french-cops">Continue reading...</a>

Bunches of mint and basil; the first peas and young broad beans from Italy; courgettes too. There are bunches of asparagus, lower in price now as the season comes to an end.

The courgettes will be grated and made into little cakes with parmesan and spring onion, and the peas will appear in a vivid green chutney to eat with crumbed and fried prawns.</p><p>I think of early summer as the green days in the kitchen, before the arrival of scarlet tomatoes and crimson summer fruits, those first few weeks of glorious sunshine before the real heat hits and all I want to eat is watermelon and feta cheese.

<p>A career in TV taught Simon Booker how to handle drama and tight schedules. That skill comes in handy as a humanist celebrant</p><p>Simon Booker left his mother’s funeral feeling he had done the best job he could. “I had my producer’s head on,” he says – he used to work in radio and TV – “as well as my grieving son head on. I was very control-freaky about it.” In particular, he was pleased with the humanist celebrant and “tucked the idea away for this phase of life – my third act”.</p><p>That was in 2010. Booker is 67 now, and last summer he enrolled on a training course for celebrants, run by <a href="https://humanists.uk/" title="">Humanists UK</a>. There he was, for two weekends, learning and performing dummy funeral ceremonies for his peers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/19/a-new-start-after-60-i-made-a-good-job-of-mums-funeral-so-i-decided-to-help-other-people-with-theirs">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I am not budging on my ‘feminist’ (lazy) decision to give up makeup. But I am busy testing perfumes that smell of goat, mushroom and seaweed</p><p>I find myself confronted, yet again, by summer grooming dilemmas, even though I don’t believe in either summer, or grooming. My approach to personal maintenance all year round is to intone “I had a beauty blog once” while gazing into the middle distance like Meryl Streep in Out of Africa. As if writing about snail goo in the past absolves me of responsibility to do anything about how I look now.</p><p>Then summer, oof! I cried for 20 minutes yesterday just because the birds looked too hot. I don’t really have the mental bandwidth for anything other than letting the heat do its worst with my keratin and whatever skin is (I just googled “What is skin?” for a snapshot of how deep into summer madness I have sunk). But is it rude to go out without making some cursory effort? In summer, you’re dealing with the dread re-emergence of feet into the public sphere, plus the way your whole face slides greasily southwards, making you look, as the writer Sarah Dempster said memorably, <a href="https://twitter.com/Dempster2000/status/1667909572848152578">“Like Noddy Holder screaming in a kiln”</a>.</p><p>Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/19/i-have-given-up-grooming-welcome-to-hot-crone-summer">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Her timely defence of blue-collar rural communities works best when the Cumbrian author explores how urban money severs the links between locals and their landscape</p><p>The blurb for Rebecca Smith’s <em>Rural: The Lives of the Working Class Countryside</em> sells it as a call to arms for the countryside’s abused, exploited and forgotten working classes, and its most memorable passages resound with all the get-off-our-land fury of a gamekeeper’s shotgun.</p><p>“An Airbnb or a second home might bring in some money for the local shop, but it won’t bring more children to the school,” she writes, revisiting the town near where she grew up in the Lake District. “They won’t be on the fundraising committees for the pantomime or the summer dances, they won’t be part of the church congregation or able to organise the local ceilidhs… by buying a house to experience that for the few weeks, or even a few months of the year, they have gradually suffocated the life forever. Throughout these villages, UK-wide, country shows are being cancelled, pubs are closing down, hotels can’t get the staff and schools are shutting. We have reached the tipping point. Some areas might even have passed it.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/19/rural-the-lives-of-the-working-class-countryside-by-rebecca-smith-review">Continue reading...</a>

We’re planning to be out of the UK for up to six months from the end of this year-middle of next.

<p>The price tags can be eye-watering for the electric model I need around my hilly London neighbourhood</p><p>It’s been 20 years since I last used a bike every day. But I’m returning to cycling because I want to take my children to school and nursery without the horrible sense of guilt from dropping them off in the car, complaints about walking or the juggle of pushchair and public transport at rush-hour.</p><p>To replace my car on the daily school run, I need an electrically powered workhorse that will carry two smallish children and the bags of stuff that we lug around wherever we go. <br /><br />The options, I’m told, are an elongated cargo bike that fits two children on the back, a detachable trailer, or a trike/bike with a giant child bucket on the front. <br /><br />In an ideal world, it will be powerful enough that I don’t feel dragged down by 30kg of offspring while chugging the household around my hilly London neighbourhood. The longtail electric cargo seems like the best fit for this brief.<br /><br />There are various “car replacement” bikes on the market with eye-watering price tags. The Tern GSD retails at £5k-plus at the top end. The model I choose to try out is a RadWagon, at the cheapest end of the market, though not actually cheap at more like £2,000 with all the necessary attachments. <br /><br />My main concern is whether I can keep my wriggling cargo safe. I spend a long time poring over Google maps to figure out a route that avoids buses and sticks to cycle paths and parks as much as possible.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2023/jun/19/ditching-the-car-for-a-cargo-bike-on-the-school-run">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Jon Erwin and Brent McCorkle’s retelling of the beginnings of the evangelical movement in the US is a sexless, inaccurate depiction</p><p>This corny but slickly made southern California-set drama looks plausibly like a million other period-set Bildungsromans made by the Hollywood entertainment sausage factory. It’s a story of a confused young teenager finding his calling in life with the help of a nice girl and some wise mentors, unfolding at the beginning of the 1970s, and it has all the hippy-era trimmings: love beads, barefoot extras, vintage cars with old-school California black and orange licence plates, and many needle drops from bands like Fleetwood Mac, America and even the Animals, who are singing about the House of the Rising Sun. That last one is a curious choice given it’s supposedly about a brothel of ill-repute, and this is a film about Christians, made by Christians and clearly for Christians.</p><p>Moreover, just as Eric Burdon is hitting the high notes about the ruin of many a poor boy, it becomes clear that we’re seeing one of the key characters in the story, the real-life figure of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonnie_Frisbee">Lonnie Frisbee</a> (played by Jonathan Roumie) as he parts ways with the others in the evangelical movement he helped start. The film suggests the rift is over Frisbee’s enthusiasm for charismatic theology and faith healing, but in actuality he was outed as gay and excommunicated from the denominations he founded because of his homosexuality.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/19/jesus-revolution-review-christian-hippy-drama-is-happy-clappy-propaganda">Continue reading...</a>

His failure will have no fathers and his success will be attributed to an abstract set of conditions that conspired to make his premiership inevitable.

## The great face off: 16 of the most wonderful portraits ever painted

<p>As the National Portrait Gallery prepares for its grand reopening this week, critics, artists and curators pick their favourite works from 500 years of portraiture</p><p><strong>Searching, wondering and staring eyes<br /></strong><em>Self-Portrait of Suffering by </em><em>Ibrahim El-Salahi</em><em>, 1961<br /></em>The African modernist El-Salahi studied at the Slade in London in the 1950s and western modernism clearly influenced him. El-Salahi’s work has often delved into the personal and here we see him in a confused, uncertain state of mind. I am reminded of the gaping mouth of Munch’s Scream, or the bull in Picasso’s Guernica, given the equine nature of the face. The hair is manic but orderly, coiled and framing deep, endless concentric circles of eyes – searching, wondering and staring somehow both at us and into the abyss. Portraits at the precipice of melancholy or mania are the most attractive to me. They are honest and human. <strong>Aindrea Emelife</strong></p><p><strong>Messy domestic moments</strong><br /><em><a href="https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw129463/Sid-James">Sid James by </a></em><em><a href="https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw129463/Sid-James">Ruskin Spear</a></em><em><a href="https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw129463/Sid-James">, 1962</a></em><br />This collage captures both the funny and sad: how life is made up of grand aspirations and messy little domestic settings. We watch comedian Sid James on TV in Hancock’s Half Hour, but also see what looks like an invitation to the opening of a Henry Moore exhibition, a CND flyer, as well as adverts for remedies for colds, flu and rheumatism on the coffee table. Maybe we’ll just stay in by the telly. <strong>Alison Smith</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/19/the-great-face-off-16-of-the-most-wonderful-portraits-ever-painted">Continue reading...</a>

The retired police forensics detective is the linchpin of the Jersey Asian Hornet Group (JAHG), a band of two dozen volunteers.

<p>Ted Kaczynski, the Harvard-educated mathematician who ran a 17-year bombing campaign that killed three people, died in prison earlier this month. But his manifesto promoting violent rebellion against the modern world continues to inspire copycat attacks</p><p>Theodore “Ted” Kaczynski died at the federal prison in Butner, North Carolina, earlier this month at the age of 81. Known as the “Unabomber”, Kaczynski waged a 17-year bombing campaign from an isolated shack in the Montana wilderness before finally being caught in 1996. One of those who helped apprehend Kaczynski was former FBI agent <strong>Jim Fitzgerald</strong>. He tells <strong>Michael Safi </strong>that the arrest was only possible following the publication of the bomber’s manifesto in the Washington Post. It was those words that were recognised by Kaczynski’s brother, who took his concerns to the authorities.</p><p>But the publication of that manifesto had other consequences. It has inspired copycat attacks and is claimed as an influence by others who have gone on to commit atrocities around the world.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/jun/19/death-unabomber-ted-kaczynski-will-dangerous-influence-live-on-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
