There\u2019s heroic tales of redemption, bitter feuds and rivalries, and even a giant green electric lad from Brazil. But the timeline is, frankly, an absolute mess.\n\nAcross 7 entries, the chronology of Capcom\u2019s fighting game franchise has been continuously retconned and re-written into oblivion. Not only does the chronology jump around, with Street Fighters 4 and 5 taking place before Street Fighter 3 and Street Fighter 6, but each game has a multitude of upgrades and alternate versions, which effectively rewrite what has come before.\n\nWe\u2019re here to do the hard work for you, and sift through the noise of Supers, Ultras, Hypers, Alphas and Turbos to provide you with a full breakdown. This is the Street Fighter timeline fully explained.\n\n00:00 - Intro\n01:22 - Street Fighter\n02:22 - Street Fighter Alpha 2\n06:21 - Street Fighter Alpha 3\n07:54 - Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo\n09:17 - Street Fighter EX Series\n09:52 - Ultra Street Fighter 4\n12:27 - Street Fighter 5\n16:17 - Street Fighter 3: Second Impact\n17:52 - Street Fighter 3: Third Strike\n18:56 - Street Fighter 6\n\nFrom the iconic fight between Ryu and Sagat all the way through to the events of Street Fighter 6 via the shady machinations of the Shadloo organization, this video breaks down the long and confusing timeline of the Street Fighter franchise.\n\n#TimelineExplained #StreetFighter #GameSpot\n\nTimeline Playlist - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gaFRoP4RUA&amp;list=PLpg6WLs8kxGN7aotOq-B5tYZWpvTZ3KRS", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhWQUJK4XgQ", "date_published": "2023-06-19 15:00:26+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
