There aren't many left. I was able to try one, and to talk to the person who still maintains it.\n\nJust to be clear, there are a few of these in other places in the world, too. There's at least a couple in North America, one in Germany, and one in Turkey! (Or at least, I think they still exist.) But the video of the Cicka got me to beautiful Slovenia, and the story that I found there was worth the trip.\n\nLocal producer: Jure Kreft at Fixmedia https://fixmedia.si\nCamera: Darko Sinti\u010d\nAudio mix: Manni Simon and Graham Haerther\n\n\"Cicka - ro\u010dna \u017ei\u010dnica \u010dez Savo by Jure Senega\u010dnik\" is available at https://youtu.be/w3i5BN2VpWs and is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 3.0: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode (that license does not extend to the rest of this video)\n\nI'm at https://tomscott.com\non Twitter at https://twitter.com/tomscott\non Facebook at https://facebook.com/tomscott\nand on Instagram as tomscottgo", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72RxerDwzEo", "date_published": "2023-06-19 15:00:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
