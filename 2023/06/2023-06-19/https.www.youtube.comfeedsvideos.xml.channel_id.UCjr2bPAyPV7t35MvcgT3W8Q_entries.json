It's an investment venture before anything else. Then it's about hoarding wealth, avoiding taxes and getting some positive PR for it.\nSupport independent research and analysis by joining my Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/thehatedone \n\nPrivate foundation is an institution with a very special status. They are tax exempt private organizations yet they are still allowed to invest into for profit companies. Foundations can hold corporate stocks and bonds and generate revenue this way.\n\nThere is only one major condition they have to fulfill to keep their tax exempt status - and that is to donate 5% of foundation's total assets on annual basis. So when you hear a billionaire donating their wealth to charity and it's going through a foundation, up to 95% of it can go into profitable investments. In practice, all foundations' assets in the US amount to more than $1 trillion. Yet, they\u00a0donated only\u00a0$90.88 billion in 2021.\n\nSources  (references are available in the transcript)\n\n[0a] https://nccs.urban.org/publication/nonprofit-sector-brief-2019#recipients\n[0b] https://www.statista.com/statistics/250878/number-of-foundations-in-the-united-states/\n[1] https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax\n[2] https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/08/us/politics/income-taxes-bezos-musk-buffett.html\n[3] https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/private-foundations\n[4] https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/private-foundations/taxes-on-failure-to-distribute-income-private-foundations\n[5] https://www.nptrust.org/philanthropic-resources/charitable-giving-statistics/\n[6] https://www.issuelab.org/resources/36381/36381.pdf\n[7] https://www.gatesfoundation.org/about/financials\n[8] https://www.thenation.com/article/society/bill-gates-foundation-philanthropy/\n[9] https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2007-jan-07-na-gatesx07-story.html\n[10] https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1166559/000110465923060842/0001104659-23-060842-index.html\n[11] https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1663801/000089843223000302/0000898432-23-000302-index.html\n[12a] https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2012-may-18-la-ford-foundation-los-angeles-times-20120517-story.html\n[12b] https://archives.cjr.org/behind_the_news/ford_foundation_los_angeles_ti.php\n[13] https://jacobin.com/2015/11/philanthropy-charity-banga-carnegie-gates-foundation-development/\n[14] https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/pearson-pays-77-million-in-common-core-settlement/2013/12/13/77515bba-6423-11e3-aa81-e1dab1360323_story.html\n[15] https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1067983/000095012323005270/0000950123-23-005270-index.html\n[16] https://philanthropynewsdigest.org/news/gates-foundation-awards-11-million-for-financial-inclusion-in-africa\n[17] https://news.stanford.edu/2018/12/03/the-problems-with-philanthropy/\n[18] https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2021/05/05/what-bill-melinda-gates-did-to-education/\n[19] https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-bill-gates-pulled-off-the-swift-common-core-revolution/2014/06/07/a830e32e-ec34-11e3-9f5c-9075d5508f0a_story.html\n[20] https://www.chalkbeat.org/2018/6/21/21105193/the-gates-foundation-bet-big-on-teacher-evaluation-the-report-it-commissioned-explains-how-those-eff\n[21] https://www.currentaffairs.org/2021/05/humanity-does-not-need-bill-gates\n[22] https://yewtu.be/watch?v=ag5zQeXC-TY\n[23] https://www.prweb.com/releases/2014/02/prweb11601976.htm\n[24] https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2015/09/23/common-core-the-gift-that-pearson-counts-on-to-keep-giving/\n[25] https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2020/02/10/bill-melinda-gates-have-spent-billions-dollars-shape-education-policy-now-they-say-theyre-skeptical-billionaires-trying-do-just-that/\n[26] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfRJx6x764U\n[27] https://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/almanac/statistics-on-u-s-generosity/[28] https://www.charitywatch.org/nonprofit-compensation-packages-of-1-million-or-more\n[29] https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/27/opinion/the-charitable-industrial-complex.html\n[30] https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2007-jan-07-na-gatesx07-story.html \n[31] https://www.latimes.com/business/la-na-gatesx7jan07-sg-storygallery.html\n[32] https://www.latimes.com/business/la-na-gates8jan8-story.html\n[33] https://policy-practice.oxfam.org/resources/carbon-billionaires-the-investment-emissions-of-the-worlds-richest-people-621446/\n[34] https://www.oxfam.org/en/research/time-care \u2192 PDF report\n[35] https://www.oxfam.org/en/research/survival-richest \u2192 PDF report\n\nCredits\nMusic by: CO.AG Music; White Bat Audio\nFollow me:\nhttps://twitter.com/The_HatedOne_\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thehatedone/\n\nThe footage and images featured in the video were for critical analysis, commentary and parody, which are protected under the Fair Use laws of the United States Copyright act of 1976.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH4uh8cHuto", "date_published": "2023-06-19 14:30:08+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
