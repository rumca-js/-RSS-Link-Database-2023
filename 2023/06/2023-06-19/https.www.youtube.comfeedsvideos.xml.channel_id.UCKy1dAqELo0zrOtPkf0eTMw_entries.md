## Aliens: Dark Descent Review

Aliens: Dark Descent reviewed on PC by Leana Hafer. Also available on PlayStation and Xbox.

If not for the technical issues, this would be easily one of the best Aliens games ever. And it still probably is. Borrowing from some of the greatest squad-based tactics games and adding its own twists, I don't think I've played anything that really gets what was so cool about Aliens, the film, since Monolith's Aliens Versus Predator 2 way back in 2001. And many have tried! It's the sort of game that makes me wish I could look the other way and praise it even higher, but on balance, I just can't. With a few weeks in the med bay for a bit of extra technical polish, it could shine up nicely into something amazing. As-is, it's still an intriguing, inspired, imaginative survival RTS that I can enthusiastically recommend, but only with some caveats.

Marvel Studios' Secret Invasion is right around the corner! IGN sat down with the series cast and crew, including Samuel L. Jackson, Olivia Colman, Emilia Clarke, Ben Mendelsohn, Kingsley Ben-Adir, and Ali Salim, to discuss the upcoming espionage thriller and just how little it has to do with the comic as a whole.

Coming to Disney+ later this month, the MCU's take on Secret Invasion will give us a whole new spin on the title. The cast and crew break down the departure from the comics, as well as the lack of The Avengers, The Defenders, The Fantastic 4, and the other major players who (probably) won't be making an appearance in the series.  Nick Fury, on the other hand, will be front and center as his longtime friend Talos take on the impending Skrull invasion.
