As we see from the following hidden recording from a middle school classroom, teachers in England are just as daft, mental, and woke.  </p><p>We go now live on tape to a Church of England school in Sussex, England. An eighth-grade classroom (I converted it from the weird way England does the grades) was being lectured on genders <a href=\"https://www.gbnews.com/news/sussex-news-rye-college-student-questioned-classmate-identifying-cat\" target=\"_blank\">when a 13-year-old girl asked</a>: \"But if some said they identified as a cat, wouldn't that be lunacy?\"</p><p>No. Lunacy is how the teacher responds.</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cTeacher @ryecollegeuk Has Meltdown At Year 9 Student Who Questions Why Another Student Is Identifying As A Cat.\\n\\nDisgraceful.\\u201d</div> \u2014 Turning Point UK \\ud83c\\uddec\\ud83c\\udde7 (@Turning Point UK \\ud83c\\uddec\\ud83c\\udde7)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TPointUK/status/1670145753669410816\">1687028752</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Before we get to the teacher, I know some of you are wondering, \"Brodigan, you said Church of England. 'Christian' Church?'\" I'll be honest, I'm not quite sure. COE is THE <a href=\"https://www.churchofengland.org/\" target=\"_blank\">established Christian church</a> of England. But they also <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/church-of-england-gender-neutral\" target=\"_blank\">refer to God using They/Them pronouns</a> and <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/church-england-transgender-rite\" target=\"_blank\">allow practitioners to affirm their sex changes</a> to... They/Them. So, yeah. There's that.</p><p>The student had a foolish idea she had a right to her opinion, but the teacher informed her that having more than two genders was NOT an opinion. \"Gender is not linked to the parts that you were born with, gender is about how you identify, which is what I said right from the very beginning of the lesson.\"</p><p>This is my favorite part.: <strong>\"W</strong><strong>here did you get this idea from that there are only two genders?\"</strong></p><p>At least 2,023 years of science.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"02e50\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=34143797&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>The teacher then said it was despicable for the two girls to say, and I quote, \"If you have a vagina you\u2019re a girl and if you have a penis you\u2019re a boy.\"</p><p>As is customary, this is the part where they get thrown out of class for reeducation. \"If you don\u2019t like it you need to go to a different school. I\u2019m reporting you to [senior staff], you need to have a proper educational conversation about equality, diversity and inclusion because I\u2019m not having that expressed in my lesson.\"</p><p>One of the girl's parents <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2023/06/19/student-called-despicable-by-teacher-after-questioning-peer-who-identifies-as-a-cat/\" target=\"_blank\">was understandably pissed about this</a>. The parent was agast that an opposing viewpoint would be shut down by a school in such a threatening and aggressive manner. Adding, \"Regardless of the subject, education should serve to build awareness of differing points of view to widen the understanding of a subject. It shouldn\u2019t be a case of indoctrination.\"</p><p>It <em>SHOULDN'T</em> be. It <em>WASN'T</em> like this. In a bygone era of 2019, you were either a boy or a girl. You could be confused too, but that wasn't considered a gender. It was just... being confused.</p><p>Yet it's 2023 and here we all are. Saying \"boys are boys and girls are girls\" is now something that goes on your permanent record. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

This revelation was made at the global <a href=\"https://www.canneslions.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Cannes Lions Festival</a>. Think the International Cannes Film Festival, but for global marketing.</p><p>Marcel Marcondes, the global chief marketing officer of AB InBev, was giving a presentation and said the company has been humbled, <a href=\"https://adage.com/article/marketing-news-strategy/bud-lights-struggles-have-been-wake-call-says-ab-inbev-cmo-cannes/2500486\" target=\"_blank\">according to a report from AdAge</a>. The controversial and divisive debates happening in America have been tough for AB InBev, because \"what they do\" is \"bring people together.\" And in a way, they have. They have brought people together in no longer drinking Bud Light.</p><blockquote>\u201cCompanies and brands must be driven by their values. We are a beer company. Beer is for everyone.\u201d </blockquote><p>...no one ever said beer isn't for everyone.</p><blockquote>That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing, being very humble, and really reminding ourselves of what we should do best every day, which is to really understand our consumers. Which is to really celebrate and appreciate every consumer that loves our brands\u2014but in a way that can make them be together, not apart.</blockquote><p>M'kay. These are all nice words. Lovely words. Some of the best words. The words globalists and elitists string together when they discuss normies like we're all some kind of sociological experiment. </p><p>Marcondes says brands need to really understand their customers. In this case, Bud Light customers. Do you know how I know none of the people in attendance care to understand their customers? The words \"global chief marketing officer\" and \"Cannes.\"</p><p>This all started when an <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-exec-bear-market\" target=\"_blank\">elitist marketing executive with an eight million dollars Upper West Side Home</a>, who <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-vice-president-marketing\" target=\"_blank\">hates the fanbase of the product she was marketing to</a>, went to a <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/captiv8-bud-light-dylan-mulvaney\" target=\"_blank\">San Francisco influencer marketing firm</a> (who also hates the fanbase) to change who enjoys their product. At no point in this journey was there anyone involved who drinks Bud Light. A free twelve-pack after rebate says no one involved knows anyone who drinks Bud Light either.</p><p>Marcondes added that the brand needs to clarify what it stands for, and that rather than standing for anything political, just be about enjoyment and togetherness. We'll see about that. Because if the global Anheuser Busch wants to get their hands on any of that sweet ESG cash, it's demanded they affirm every woke progressive worldview and political agenda. It is hard to bring enjoyment and togetherness when you take a clear political side on every issue. It's always a side that goes against most of your customers, and never a side that has anything to do with drinking beer.</p><p>If Americans are as tired of it as they seem to be -- Mulvaney was just wonder woke corporate pander too many -- that's why we at LWC endorse drinking and shopping local. Keep your money in your community and stop giving it to global companies who hate you.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

He demanded free cigarettes. Moreno said no, because if she gave him free cigs...wait for it...she would be fired.

When an armed thug comes behind the counter and you have nowhere else to go, it's self-defense.</p><p>I have to hand it to Circle K. They managed to provide us with a more absurd example than the Lululemon employees who <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lululemon-fires-two-employees\" target=\"_blank\">got fired for calling the cops on a shoplifter</a>. The two employees in that story had options, like NOT calling the cops and not following the shoplifters out of the store. Moreno had to make a split-second decision. All the thug had to do is make one quick motion to the left, and Moreno would have been stabbed. You wonder if Circle K has a zero-tolerance policy for their employees being murdered.</p><p>Yet another example of why, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/shoplifter-walmart-greeter\" target=\"_blank\">while I understand the instinct to get involved</a>, it's a corporate chain and is simply not worth it. If you are defending a small, independently owned business, that's one thing and encouraged. But time and again, these companies have made it clear they don't care about you.

A poem from Amanda Gorman was <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/poltifact-book-ban-desantis\" target=\"_blank\">moved from the middle school area of the library to the high school area of the library</a>. It is considered a \"book ban\" by the left because middle school students have to go to a different area of the library.</p><p>2. DeSantis <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/andrea-mitchell-apologizes-team-desantis\" target=\"_blank\">opposes a single AP African-American History curriculum</a> because he feels history should teach kids about history and not Marxist indoctrination or who is banging who.</p><p>3. There are conservatives who feel that books about <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-book-banning\" target=\"_blank\">kids tasting their vagina slime, teaching them how to give a handy to make someone cum, and graphic novels about two dudes f*cking</a> are inappropriate to be available in schools. Now, if you as a parent feel your kid learning about tasting their vagina slime, how to give a handy to make someone cum, or read a graphic novel about two dudes f*cking is crucial to their development, you can go on Amazon.com and have the book by tomorrow. It's not banned. It just won't be available in school. </p><p>Leftists and media (but I repeat myself) using \"book banning\" as a talking point only works if they don't provide any examples. it's crucial to always provide examples to show a) nothing is banned, and b) this is the garbage Biden Democrats support.<br /></p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.
