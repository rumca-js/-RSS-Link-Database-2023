Also available on PlayStation and Xbox.\n\nIf not for the technical issues, this would be easily one of the best Aliens games ever. And it still probably is. Borrowing from some of the greatest squad-based tactics games and adding its own twists, I don't think I've played anything that really gets what was so cool about Aliens, the film, since Monolith's Aliens Versus Predator 2 way back in 2001. And many have tried! It's the sort of game that makes me wish I could look the other way and praise it even higher, but on balance, I just can't. With a few weeks in the med bay for a bit of extra technical polish, it could shine up nicely into something amazing. As-is, it's still an intriguing, inspired, imaginative survival RTS that I can enthusiastically recommend, but only with some caveats.\n\n#AliensDarkDescent #Review", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBwj3MzTWDs", "date_published": "2023-06-19 18:00:16+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Synced - Official Steam Next Fest Trailer", "description": "Synced is a free-to-play cooperative shooter developed by Next Studios set in a futuristic world devastated by rogue technology.
