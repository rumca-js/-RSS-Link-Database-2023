<p>This is a good moment to get an Apple smartwatch if you're more concerned about price than anything else. Amazon is once more selling the Apple Watch Series 8 with a 41mm case and GPS <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9BcHBsZS1XYXRjaC1NaWRuaWdodC1BbHVtaW51bS1BbHdheXMvZHAvQjBCREpCRzc0Ui8_dGg9MSZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby0xM2UtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjZkYTdjMjdiLTMxZjctNGNiZS1hZTUzLTQ4YWIzYmVhOTgwMCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAdKc6PViOZ-VVA1YYN_SbCDwun_yxmaVd26aK47QbLcb&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-Watch-Midnight-Aluminum-Always%2Fdp%2FB0BDJBG74R%2F%3Fth%3D1">for $329</a>, or a steep $70 discount that's very nearly a record low. This applies to all but the Product Red color, and you'll also see bargains for cellular and 45mm models.</p><p></p><p>The Apple Watch Series 8 may be an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-8-real-world-test-130031046.html">iterative update</a>, but it remains our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-smartwatches-153013118.html">favorite overall smartwatch</a>. You can expect brisk performance, an exceptional display, solid fitness tracking and robust health features that include ECGs, blood oxygen monitoring, crash detection and a temperature sensor for sleep and reproductive cycle tracking. More importantly, there's a strong ecosystem that includes a wide range of third-party apps as well as tight integration with other Apple products. You can seamlessly switch AirPods between your iPhone and watch, or unlock your Mac.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The catch, aside from the iPhone requirement, is simply that Series 8 is several months old. We won't be surprised if there's an Apple Watch Series 9 in September. The current generation is much easier to justify at $329, though, and it will easily handle <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-apple-watch-embraces-widgets-again-in-watchos-10-180838970.html">watchOS 10</a> when the software upgrade arrives later this year. And right now, this is arguably the best value in the lineup. While the second-generation Apple Watch SE is priced lower at $249, the gap is small enough that it may be worth the extra money for the 8's always-on display and more advanced health sensors.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter and </em><a href="https://subscription.yahoo.net/Newsletter/Preference/sub?b=engadgetdeals&amp;src"><em>subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter</em></a><em> for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-8-is-back-on-sale-for-329-141547847.html?src=rss

<p>Samsung has announced that its self-repair program is <a href="https://www.samsungmobilepress.com/press-releases/samsung-electronics-expands-the-self-repair-program-to-europe/">now available</a> in the UK and other European countries, after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-ifixit-self-repair-program-available-launch-date-134634384.html">launching in the US</a> last year. Users will be able to access tools and parts needed to fix supported devices, namely the Galaxy S20, S21 and S22 smartphones, along with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-book-pro-360-hands-on-amoled-price-specs-available-now-140057157.html">Galaxy Book Pro</a> regular and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-book-pro-360-15-inch-review-price-specs-130006444.html">Galaxy Book Pro 360</a> laptops.</p><p>"Samsung is working to extend the lifecycle of our devices to encourage users to experience the optimised performance of their Galaxy device for as long as possible," said Samsung's president and Head of Mobile eXperience, TM Roh. "We are committed to scaling access to our Self-Repair program around the world while improving the repairability of our products."</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition to the UK, the program will be available in Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain and Sweden. Samsung collaborated with iFixit in the US, but parts distributors ASWO and 2Service will handle sales and distribution of the repair kits in Europe. The program is already live in parts of Europe, and will come to other regions including the UK by the end of June.&nbsp;</p><p>Galaxy S20, S21 and S22 series owners will be able to replace the phone screen, back glass and charging ports. If you need to fix a Galaxy Book Pro, you'll have access to seven parts, including the case front, case rear, display, battery, touchpad, power key with fingerprint reader and rubber feet.&nbsp;</p><p>Repair kits cost around €30 in Germany (UK pricing isn't yet available). For a Galaxy S20, the charging port and back panel are around €50, while the display costs €200. That climbs for newer and higher-end models, up to €310 for the Galaxy S22 Ultra display.

## Reddit hackers demand $4.5 million and API changes in threat to leak 80GB of data

<p>In February, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/reddit-hacked-targeted-phishing-attack-062457231.html">Reddit revealed it had been the victim of a targeted phishing scheme</a> that exposed internal docs, dashboards, code and contracts, along with some advertisers' and current and former employees' information. None of the data appears to have found its way to the public, but that could soon change. Ransomware gang BlackCat, also known as ALPHV, has just taken responsibility for the hack and claims to have 80GB of compressed data. In a post called &quot;The Reddit Files,&quot; BlackCat announced it would delete the information if Reddit gives it $4.5 million and reverses API price increases.</p><p>BlackCat captured the information through a scheme that saw employees receive &quot;plausible sounding prompts&quot; to visit a website designed just like Reddit's intranet gateway. One individual fell for the trick, allowing hackers to steal their login details and second-factor tokens. The person then self-reported their mistake, and it's believed the security breach didn't compromise Reddit users' personal information.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Now, months later, the hackers have publicly revealed themselves in the midst of site-wide protests against API price hikes (yes, the same ones BlackCat is <em>so admirably</em> demanding be undone). The increased cost is forcing popular third-party apps like Narwhal and Apollo to shut down, with Apollo creator Christian Selig claiming he would need to<a href="https://www.engadget.com/reddit-app-developer-says-the-sites-new-api-rules-will-cost-him-20-million-a-year-203911487.html"> spend $20 million per year</a> to stay in business. Developers also fear <a href="https://www.engadget.com/reddit-communities-are-going-dark-to-protest-changes-that-would-hurt-third-party-apps-154133342.html">losing third-party apps will lead to more censoring</a> and less opportunity for growing ad revenue.</p><p>A massive protest saw up to 8,000 subreddits go dark at one time, but the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/reddits-average-daily-traffic-fell-during-blackout-according-to-third-party-data-194721801.html">results are mixed</a>, with Reddit doubling down on its plans. &quot;These people who are mad, they're mad because they used to get something for free, and now it's going to be not free,&quot; Reddit CEO Steve Hoffman said in an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/15/23762868/reddit-ceo-steve-huffman-interview">interview with <em>The Verge</em></a>. He has also suggested making it easier to remove moderators who aren't making &quot;popular&quot; decisions. Though Reddit shows no signs of reversing its decision, some advertisers have paused on the site while blackouts continue.</p><p>It's uncertain how, if at all, this new development will impact API prices, with Reddit yet to comment on whether it will meet the demands. BlackCat claims Reddit ignored its past two contact attempts, in April and June, and doesn't have much hope a public ultimatum will make a difference. &quot;We are very confident that Reddit will not pay any money for their data,&quot; BlackCat stated in its post. &quot;We expect to leak the data.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/reddit-hackers-demand-45-million-and-api-changes-in-threat-to-leak-80gb-of-data-114041164.html?src=rss

<p>Tudum, Netflix’s in-house mix of Comic Con and shareholder presentation, took place this weekend. The company used the moment to tease plenty of forthcoming projects, including its live-action remakes of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-offers-a-peek-at-one-piece-and-avatar-the-last-airbender-live-action-adaptations-222828717.html"><em><ins>One Piece</ins></em><ins> and </ins><em><ins>Avatar: The Last Airbender</ins></em></a>. It also showed off its adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning World War II novel <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-shares-teaser-for-world-war-ii-drama-all-the-light-we-cannot-see-211706050.html"><em><ins>All The Light We Cannot See</ins></em></a>.</p><p>The streamer also revealed the first teaser for the adaptation of Liu Cixin’s award-winning sci-fi novel <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflixs-3-body-problem-first-look-confirms-january-2024-premiere-213927002.html"><em><ins>The Three Body Problem</ins></em></a>. That has the distinction of being the first (finished) project to come from Game of Thrones co-creators / co-ruiners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss since all of <em>that</em>.</p><p>But what’s likely to be the biggest new release was the game show adaptation of blockbuster dystopia <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflixs-squid-game-reality-competition-show-debuts-this-november-204334075.html"><em><ins>Squid Game</ins></em></a>, which will land in November. The series puts 456 contestants through a set of grueling challenges until one winner walks away with $4.56 million in prize money. Bear in mind that participants have already described their experiences on the show as “absolutely inhumane,” and plenty of contestants required medical attention during the challenges.

## The FCC is preparing to take a 'fresh look' at internet data caps

<p>Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chairperson Jessica Rosenworcel wants to open a formal Notice of Inquiry into the impact of internet data caps on consumers, according to an <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-394416A1.pdf">FCC document</a> spotted by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/06/fcc-chair-to-investigate-exactly-how-much-everyone-hates-data-caps/"><em>Ars Technica</em></a>. The regulator will also consider "taking action" to ensure that data caps don't harm competition or impact access to broadband services, according to the letter.&nbsp;</p><p>"Internet access is no longer nice-to-have, but need-to-have for everyone, everywhere," Rosenworcel said in a statement. "When we need access to the internet, we aren’t thinking about how much data it takes to complete a task, we just know it needs to get done. It’s time the FCC take a fresh look at how data caps impact consumers and competition."</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With the Notice of Inquiry, the FCC would "seek comment to better understand why the use of data caps continues to persist despite increased broadband needs of consumers and providers' demonstrated technical ability to offer unlimited data plans," according to the letter.&nbsp;</p><p>Rosenworcel would be unable to take any action on data caps at the moment, though. The FCC currently has just four members (two Democrats and two Republicans), as the Senate refused to confirm President Biden's first nominee, Gigi Sohn, and she subsequently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/public-internet-advocate-gigi-sohn-withdraws-from-fcc-consideration-201020427.html">withdrew her name</a> for consideration. The White House has since nominated telecom attorney Anna Gomez, who <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/22/biden-nominates-telecom-attorney-anna-gomez-to-fcc.html">appears to have the support</a> of the telecom industry. A nomination hearing for Gomez is scheduled for this Thursday, June 22nd.&nbsp;</p><p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, broadband provider Comcast temporarily removed data caps, but it continues to impose a<a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=ae1f1c5e-7717-478b-ad5c-c0b7029ab199&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Xfinity&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJhZTFmMWM1ZS03NzE3LTQ3OGItYWQ1Yy1jMGI3MDI5YWIxOTkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueGZpbml0eS5jb20vc3VwcG9ydC9hcnRpY2xlcy9kYXRhLXVzYWdlLXdoYXQtaXMtdGhlLXRlcmFieXRlLWRhdGEtdXNhZ2UtcGxhbiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMjZkODE0OGItNmE0OC00OTRhLWJjMzItYjQxMTRjMjc5OGIxIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAZ1CWkeZAFO7KDtOfYudBx4tFOxszL9BXUbRJL1QKv6P&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xfinity.com%2Fsupport%2Farticles%2Fdata-usage-what-is-the-terabyte-data-usage-plan"> 1.2TB data cap</a> on certain contracts in some US regions. Charter's deal with the FCC to not impose data caps  on its Spectrum service (struck when it acquired Time Warner) ended this year, but the company <a href="https://www.lightreading.com/broadband/charter-has-no-plans-to-add-data-caps-when-fcc-ban-lifts/d/d-id/784184">recently said</a> it has "no plans to [restart data caps] when the condition sunsets."&nbsp;</p><p>Along with the proposed Notice of Inquiry, the FCC has opened a new portal to allow consumers to share how data caps have affected them (on fixed or wireless broadband networks) at <a href="https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/articles/16136257875348-Data-Caps-Experience-Form">fcc.gov/datacapstories</a>. That will help the FCC determine how data caps impact access for everyone "including those with disabilities, low-income consumers, and historically disadvantaged communities, and access to online education, telehealth and remote work," the Commission wrote.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-fcc-is-preparing-to-take-a-fresh-look-at-internet-data-caps-084245899.html?src=rss
