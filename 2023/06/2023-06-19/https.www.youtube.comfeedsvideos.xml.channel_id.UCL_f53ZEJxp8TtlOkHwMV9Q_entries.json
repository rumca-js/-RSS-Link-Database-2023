Peterson and former Vice President Mike Pence discuss his current run for the 2024 presidency, the U.S. Government's overreach in economic matters when it should be playing referee, the indoctrination and sexualization of our youngest citizens, the realistic way forward on the Russia Ukraine front, and how we might finally stabilize a nation wrought with cultural warfare. \n\nMike Pence, an American politician and native Hoosier, served as the 48th vice president of the United States from 2017 to 2021. He previously served as the 50th governor of Indiana from 2013 to 2017, and a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from 2001 to 2013. Before this he practiced private law, led the Indiana Policy Review Foundation, and hosted \u201cThe Mike Pence Show,\u201d a syndicated talk radio show that also aired as a public affairs program on TV once a week. He only recently announced his candidacy for President of the United States, and is currently on the campaign trail.\n\nDr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8\n\nEp.368\n\n\n- Sponsors -\n\nExpressVPN: Get 3 Months FREE of ExpressVPN: https://expressvpn.com/jordan\n\nMoink: Get FREE bacon in your first Moink order today!\nMoinkBox.com/JBP\n\nBirch Gold: Text \"JORDAN\" to 989898 for your no-cost, no-obligation, FREE information kit.\n\n\n- Links -\n\nFor Former VP Mike Pence:\n\nCampaign website https://winred.mikepence2024.com/mike-pence-for-president/endorse-mike-pence-gs/?utm_campaign=20230607_RW-PV.102976_t1349066-2833&amp;ex_tid=20230607_RW-PV.102976_t1349066-2833&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw-b-kBhB-EiwA4fvKrP2mG12lObSBqxgeGAXKK6T6PGsZXmG_d9X88hMeyqV4dFtezETfyRoCpsoQAvD_BwE \n\nTwitter @Mike_Pence https://twitter.com/Mike_Pence?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor \n\n\n- Chapters - \n\n(0:00) Coming up\n(0:12) Intro\n(1:11) Why run now?\n(4:11) A return to normalcy, Coolidge\n(6:52) The question Democrats won\u2019t answer\n(11:21) Education, who controls the curriculum?\n(14:09) The ability to choose\n(18:30) Competition improves quality\n(22:28) Hate speech and the incitement of violence\n(23:17) Pence\u2019s stance on the Russia Ukraine war\n(29:46) A good emergency\n(30:21) Repel the invasion, post war boundaries\n(37:05) Is NATO a threat to Russia?\n(42:34) The lack of international respect for the Biden Administration\n(43:57) Joe Biden\u2019s failure with the Afghanistan withdrawal\n(47:23) Those who choose to look strong rather than being strong\n(50:13) When Pence last spoke to Putin, \u201cThat can\u2019t happen again\u201d\n(53:00) One hand outstretched, one on the holster\n(54:25) Serving with Donald Trump, and why Pence is running against him\n(1:00:19) What a \u201cConservative Agenda\u201d means for America and the world\n\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\n\n// COURSES //\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\n\n// BOOKS //\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\n\n// LINKS //\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\n\n// SOCIAL //\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\n\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNSg5TlwB6k", "date_published": "2023-06-19 15:00:41+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
