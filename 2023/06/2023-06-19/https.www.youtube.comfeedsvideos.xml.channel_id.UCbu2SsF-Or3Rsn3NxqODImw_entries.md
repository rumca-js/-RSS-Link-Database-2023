Street Fighter is a franchise rich with weird and wonderful characters, packed with narrative twists and turns. There’s heroic tales of redemption, bitter feuds and rivalries, and even a giant green electric lad from Brazil. But the timeline is, frankly, an absolute mess.

Across 7 entries, the chronology of Capcom’s fighting game franchise has been continuously retconned and re-written into oblivion. Not only does the chronology jump around, with Street Fighters 4 and 5 taking place before Street Fighter 3 and Street Fighter 6, but each game has a multitude of upgrades and alternate versions, which effectively rewrite what has come before.

We’re here to do the hard work for you, and sift through the noise of Supers, Ultras, Hypers, Alphas and Turbos to provide you with a full breakdown. This is the Street Fighter timeline fully explained.
