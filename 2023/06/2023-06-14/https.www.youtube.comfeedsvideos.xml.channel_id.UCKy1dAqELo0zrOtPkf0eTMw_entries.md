Harmony: The Fall of Reverie reviewed by Gabriel Moss on PC, also available on Switch, Xbox, and PlayStation.

This powerful visual novel from Life is Strange developer Don't Nod mixes a world-bending story with deeply personal stakes. It takes a while to get going, though it also makes familiarizing yourself with its somewhat dense lore easy thanks to a built-in codex that explains most of the in-world jargon required to understand what‚Äôs going on. But hidden between Reverie‚Äôs magic and metaphors is a story firmly rooted in the power of community, reflecting the resilience of the human spirit itself.

## How Michael Keaton‚Äôs Batman Went From Flop to Phenomenon

It‚Äôs 1988, and the new Batman has just been announced. There‚Äôs no internet, because it‚Äôs 1988, so I‚Äôm hearing this news on the corner of 12th Street and Broadway at Manhattan‚Äôs comic-book mecca of the time, Forbidden Planet.
But the thing is, people are pissed. Michael Keaton? Mr. Mom?! How could this guy be Batman?!

But it wasn‚Äôt just the fans. The Wall Street Journal ran a front-page story in November of that year questioning the casting of Keaton as Batman. That in turn spurred on even more media speculation about the choices being made on this multi-million dollar movie.
And then there were the petitions and the letter-writing campaigns where fans are said to have pleaded with Warner Bros. to get rid of Keaton and change the course of the DC film ‚Äì some reports say there were 50,000 letters written!

The role of Batman is so huge now, as is Keaton‚Äôs part in making the character the big-screen legend that he is, that it‚Äôs hard to conceptualize today what a shock his casting was in 1988. But at the time, the actor was mostly known for his comedic roles like Mr. Mom.

Of course, the echos of Tim Burton‚Äôs Batman still influence the superhero movie genre to this day, even as Keaton himself returns to the role for The Flash some 31 years after being away. But it‚Äôs easy to forget now that when he first donned the cowl and eyeliner, there were a ton of fans who couldn‚Äôt handle the notion of Mr. Mom, Beetlejuice, the Clean and Sober guy, and so on playing Batman. And for better or worse, it would be a trend that would continue with pretty much every Batman since, from Christian Bale to Ben Affleck to Robert Pattinson (and even Val Kilmer and George Clooney if you dig deep enough).

So let‚Äôs look back at the inauspicious debut of Michael Keaton‚Äôs Batman, and how his Dark Knight would go on to soar all the same, paving the way for the big-screen dominance of the character ever since.
