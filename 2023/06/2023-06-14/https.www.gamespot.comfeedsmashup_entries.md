<p dir="ltr">There is no shortage of hard-hitting, big-budget games coming over the next year, but for every <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/armored-core-vi-fires-of-rubicon/">Armored Core VI</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/alan-wake-2-11-clues-you-may-have-missed-in-the-may-2023-trailer/2900-4756/">Alan Wake II</a>, there's also a smaller-scale game you might have missed hearing about. While these games might lack the sheer marketing power bigger studios can afford, they can be every bit as ambitious, inventive, artistic, and heartfelt. And, more often than not, these games are also the ones that aren't afraid to be experimental, and can influence future games and genres.</p><p dir="ltr">During my time at Summer Game Fest 2023, I got the chance to sit down with quite a few games existing outside the AAA sphere. I walked away from each and every one of them impressed and eager not only to tell the world about them, but to add them to my own Steam wishlist as well. From the first-person puzzle game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/viewfinder/">Viewfinder</a>, to the tactical turn-based volleyball game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/beastieball/">Beastieball</a>, here's a list of the best hidden gems I played at Summer Game Fest 2023.</p><figure style="width: 3840px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4153664-viewfinder_2022_12-08-22_001.jpg"><img alt="A black and white photo is used to create a ramp to your objective in Viewfinder." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1639/16394322/4153664-viewfinder_2022_12-08-22_001.jpg" /></a><figcaption>A black and white photo is used to create a ramp to your objective in Viewfinder.</figcaption></figure><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Viewfinder</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Viewfinder is a game that, as I can imagine Portal did all those years ago, feels too clever and ambitious to ever work. Yet, as I sat down and played through its first 10 minutes, I was blown away by just how smooth its gameplay was. The premise is simple enough: You are tasked with solving puzzles by lifting up photographs and embedding them into a level. As you stamp the photograph down, you are then able to walk through it, with this new area taking you either to a new image you can use, or granting you access to a previously blocked off area. If you make a mistake, you can rewind to the point where things went wrong, allowing players to experiment with solutions without the game feeling too stressful.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/7-upcoming-games-you-might-not-have-heard-of-but-could-be-your-next-favorite/1100-6515242/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## CoD: Warzone 2 DMZ - How To Get All Vondel Weapon Case Event Rewards

<p dir="ltr">Season 4 is live in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20/">Call of Duty: Warzone 2</a>, and the big update adds the brand-new Vondel map. Just like the other maps in the game, Vondel has a unique Weapon Case event for DMZ, and here we guide you through everything you need to know to get all the new rewards.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Weapon Case events explained</h2><p dir="ltr">Vondel's DMZ's Weapon Case event works much like the ones on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-2-0-dmz-how-to-get-all-weapon-case-event-rewards/1100-6509342/">Al Mazrah</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-2-dmz-how-to-get-all-ashika-island-weapon-case-event-rewards/1100-6511574/">Ashika Island</a>. The event only happens once per match, and it can quickly turn into a chaotic free-for-all, as only one person (and their squadmates) can claim the reward each game. There are six unique rewards that can be earned for Vondel's Weapon Case event.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to locate and complete the event</h2><p dir="ltr">The boss for Vondel is called Bullfrog, and he won't show up right away, but eventually you'll see a text notification informing you that "Bullfrog has entered Vondel." The event is marked on the map with the yellow weapon case icon, and once Bullfrog arrives, he'll be marked with a white skull icon. This icon will be constantly changing locations on the map, as the Bullfrog is driving around Vondel in an armored truck.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-2-dmz-how-to-get-all-vondel-weapon-case-event-rewards/1100-6515243/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/alan-wake-ii/">Alan Wake 2</a> is set to arrive on October 17 for current-gen consoles and PC. That makes it perfectly timed for Halloween, as the sequel 13 years in the making is Remedy's first foray into the survival-horror genre. We're eagerly awaiting the game's launch ourselves, so much so that we've already published a ton of coverage on the game, including interviews with the studio and cast, more than a few theory-crafting articles, and some new videos to dive into like it's Cauldron Lake.</p><p>We felt it'd be easiest for you to find all that in one spot, so if you're looking for exclusive and original Alan Wake 2 reporting, interviews, and features, look no further.</p><div><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a href="https://www.gamespot.com">hide</a>]</span><ul class="collapse in" id="toc_list"><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com">Alan Wake 2 trailer dissections</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="Alan_Wake_2_trailer_dissections">Alan Wake 2 trailer dissections</h2><p>To date, we've seen two Alan Wake 2 trailers.

## Marvel's Secret Invasion Review - The MCU Tries Its Own Andor With Mixed Results

<p dir="ltr">The latest entry in the long-running Marvel Cinematic Universe is quite a departure from the superhero fare you're used to. It's hard to narrow down a Marvel project to just one thing, but chances are it involves superheroes, mind-bending special powers, and a massive roster of returning characters that may or may not mean something in the long run. Secret Invasion isn't that and, truthfully, that's somewhat refreshing.</p><p dir="ltr">Secret Invasion isn't a run-of-the-mill superhero story. Instead, it's a Nick Fury-centric tale of espionage, foreign adversaries, and attempting to stay two steps ahead of the governments of the world--including Fury's own--as he attempts to stave off a literal alien invasion.</p><p dir="ltr">The gist of the story is that Fury has been building up a space station for years, and while he wasn't looking, the Skrulls fully invaded Earth, with many of them bent on overthrowing humans via terrorist attacks. In the first two episodes of the series provided for review, viewers are introduced to a world that looks more like The Falcon and the Winter Soldier than anything else in the MCU, but it quickly becomes obvious that unlike that show's terrorist group, the Flag Smashers, the Skrulls have a long-term game plan in mind and are playing it to the letter. It all helps the show to play less like an Avengers movie and more like FX's The Americans--or even Disney+'s Andor. A franchise drenched in lore and god-like characters doing a street-level exploration of a non-powered spy? It's certainly believable that Marvel Studios looked at the critical success of Andor and tried to replicate it.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvels-secret-invasion-review-the-mcu-tries-its-own-andor-with-mixed-results/1900-6418079/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The Game of Thrones spin-off House of the Dragon is coming back for a second season, and showrunner Ryan Condal has teased more of what to expect from the sophomore season. <strong>Be warned that this story contains spoilers for House of the Dragon.</strong></p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/06/house-of-the-dragon-paddy-considine-emma-darcy-matt-smith-olivia-cooke-interview-1235414671/">Deadline</a>, Condal said Season 1 laid the foundation and now Season 2 will settle into the "more traditional rhythms of storytelling."</p><p>"We did the hard, complex work of setting up this entirely new dynasty and family and all the players in Season 1 and took the time to do all the character work so you understood where everybody fell along the line of are they on Alicent's side of the equation, Aegon's side or are they on Rhaenyra's side and Daemon's side," Condal said. "The excitement now is that we get to fall into the more traditional rhythms of storytelling and see where that story is going to go."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-will-have-more-traditional-storytelling/1100-6515236/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Alan Wake 2: Five Things We Learned Behind Closed Doors

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/alan-wake-ii/">Alan Wake 2</a> is Remedy's first survival-horror game, but it's also the team's first detective game. Sure, Max Payne was a cop, but the gameplay there was limited mostly to third-person gunfights. In Alan Wake 2, investigations play a huge role in the mind-bending story, and during a recent demo with Remedy behind closed doors at Summer Game Fest, we started to piece together the game ourselves. Here are five new things we learned from conversations and demos with Remedy.</p><h2 dir="ltr">The Overlap is where reality gets blurry</h2><p dir="ltr">In the demo we were shown, we learned of The Overlap, a location in the real world where the Dark Place bleeds over, causing a sort of spacetime distortion not unlike something you'd see in Netflix's Dark.

<p>If you thought the upcoming Souls-like game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lies-of-p/">Lies of P</a> looked a lot like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/bloodborne/">Bloodborne</a>, then you're not alone. A modding team known as Garden of Eyes has decided to add Bloodborne gear to Lies of P for PC players.</p><p dir="ltr">As shown in its trailer, instead of loading in as Pinocchio, you spawn as The Hunter with weapons straight out of Bloodborne. Currently, the only way to get the mod is to join the group's <a href="https://www.patreon.com/GardenOfEyes">Patreon</a>. The mod can be used in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/lies-of-p-36-minutes-of-demo-gameplay/2300-6461562/">Lies of P demo</a> and lets you use the following items: Hunter Attire, Saw Cleaver, and Ludwig's Holy Blade.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">In a press release, the team members revealed that "they plan to expand upon the mod heavily when the full game is released."

<p>Season 4 is live <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20/">Call of Duty: Warzone 2</a>, and the big update overhauls DMZ's menu and progression systems to provide quality-of-life improvements and faster leveling of the story factions. Here is everything you need to know about earning reputation and leveling up Factions in Season 4 of DMZ.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to earn faction reputation in DMZ</h2><p dir="ltr">Previously, DMZ only offered one way to level up factions and unlock the story missions for each. This method was a massive grind with increasingly difficult missions to complete. With Season 4's new reputation system, players have more than one way to unlock the story missions. This reputation is earned through completing faction or urgent missions.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Faction missions</h3><p dir="ltr">DMZ mission progress from last season has been wiped, meaning all players start Season 4 with a fresh set of missions for each faction. These are a mix of new and reworked missions from past seasons. The biggest difference this season is that completing these will now reward you with faction reputation, which is the new way to level up the factions and unlock story missions.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-2-dmz-how-to-earn-faction-reputation/1100-6515233/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Sony has announced the next batch of games coming to the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog, with 19 titles being added on June 20, the one-year anniversary of the new tier-based setup for PS Plus.</p><p>The selection for June is a collection of great action, retro-inspired, and mystery games, starting with Far Cry 6 for PS5 and PS4. While this is a very formulaic Far Cry, the sixth entry in the core numbered series is still a fun sandbox in which you're tasked with toppling a dictator who is brought to life by actor Giancarlo Esposito. It's your typical Far Cry experience, as you'll cause chaos, unlock parts of the map with your rebel activities, and do some spelunking along the way.</p><p>Moving on from Ubisoft's sandbox, the excellent retro-inspired Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge will also be available on the PS Plus Catalog. A love letter to Konami's beloved TMNT arcade games, Shredder's Revenge looks like it was pulled straight out of the '90s. The game has a fast and fluid sense of action, plus you can play as Master Splinter, April O'Neil, and Casey Jones. <em>Goongalah</em>!</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-game-catalog-gets-19-new-games-in-june/1100-6515230/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>When <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/alan-wake-ii/">Alan Wake 2</a> arrives this October, it may wind up as one of the year's darkest and scariest experiences. It is, after all, Remedy's first survival-horror game and focuses largely on ritualistic and cultish murders in the Pacific Northwest. The Seven-inspired sequel is sure to be a moody horror story. And yet, with Epic Games publishing, there also seems to be a strong possibility of Alan Wake himself, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/exclusive-alan-wake-2-new-hero-saga-anderson-ushers-in-remedys-darkest-version-of-the-sequel/1100-6514543/">new co-lead Saga Anderson</a>, coming to the bubbly and bright Fortnite in the future.</p><p>Everything seems to come to Fortnite eventually, so during a longer talk with Remedy creative director Sam Lake, I took a second to get Remedy's temperature on a possible crossover.</p><p>"I think that would be an interesting thought and a conversation [would need] to be had with them," said Lake. "Let's see if they would be interested in something like that. Then we could seriously talk about it and think about it."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remedy-is-open-to-having-alan-wake-appear-in-fortnite/1100-6515227/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Sony has revealed that it isn't looking to change its PS Plus first-party strategy and will continue to introduce older first-party PlayStation titles to the service as opposed to new releases.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/playstation-confident-in-ps-plus-strategy-as-it-readies-ps5-game-streaming">Gamesindustry.biz</a>, Sony's head of subscriptions, Nick Maguire, makes it clear that the company isn't looking to focus on new releases for PS Plus, opting instead to continue waiting some months after the initial launch of games to add them to the subscription service.</p><p>"We're happy with our strategy," Maguire stated. "Putting games in a bit later in the life cycle has meant that we can reach more customers 12, 18, 24 months after they have released. We're seeing customers still get excited about those games and jumping in. For us, that's working. Occasionally, there will be an opportunity to invest in a day-and-date like Stray and we will jump on those when they come in. But for us, letting those [first-party] games go out to the platform outside the service first… that's working, and that will continue to be our strategy moving forward."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-plans-to-continue-adding-older-first-party-games-to-ps-plus-not-new-ones/1100-6515231/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Simply logging in once a month earns players a certain amount of a special currency, called Trader's Tenders, which can be used at the Trading Post to purchase weapon appearances, cloaks, toys, pets, mounts, and more.

<p dir="ltr">Bethesda's recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starfield/">Starfield</a> Direct gave players an incredibly in-depth look at the game, showcasing everything from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-lets-you-customize-your-ship-with-new-weapons-modules-and-crew-abilities/1100-6515079/">ship customization</a> to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-space-combat-lets-you-allocate-power-dogfight-and-board-enemy-ships/1100-6515072/">interstellar combat</a> to the most detailed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-features-the-most-detailed-character-creation-in-a-bethesda-game-yet/1100-6515075/">character creation system</a> to ever appear in a Bethesda game. We also learned about the game's massive collection of 1,000+ explorable planets, but one rather vital detail was missing: How exactly are players supposed to explore a planet once they've landed on its surface?</p><p dir="ltr">We already know that Starfield's ships cannot fly low over a planet's atmosphere. Instead, players pick a "parking spot" from orbit, land their spacecraft, and disembark to have a look around. From what we've seen, planetside exploration takes place entirely on foot. While planets with low-g environments and what appears to be a jetpack on the character's spacesuit may allow for large leaps that make for quicker on-foot travel on some planets, one has to wonder how exactly planetside exploration works on high-gravity worlds. Because for all the neat game features seen in the showcase, one vital ingredient still appears to be missing: a rover, or any sort of vehicle meant to more easily facilitate the exploration of a planet's surface.</p><p dir="ltr">Although the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mass-effect/">Mass Effect</a>'s Mako rover was a bit clunky to operate, it still got the job done, and was a heck of a lot faster than wandering the game's planets on foot. (It was also vastly improved in the games's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mass-effect-legendary-edition-review/1900-6417679/">Legendary Edition</a>.) Similarly, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/no-mans-sky/">No Man's Sky</a>--which seems to have inspired a great deal of the content in Starfield--has an expansive fleet of "<a href="https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/Exocraft">exocraft</a>" that make exploring the game's many planets far more convenient. The apparent <a href="https://youtu.be/D-cTjb52gtY">lack of any sort of surface-traversal vehicle in Starfield is a bit concerning</a>, especially given the fact that Mass Effect 1 only had about 40 planets and moons to explore (not counting DLC-exclusive planets) while Starfield has over 1,000.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/weve-now-seen-starfield-but-a-key-gameplay-feature-remains-a-mystery/1100-6515225/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Galactus, The Nuisance Of Marvel Snap, Has Finally Been Nerfed

<p>One of Marvel Snap's most controversial cards has finally gotten hit hard with the nerf bat. Galactus, the card that destroys all of the other locations, has gotten a major power adjustment in the latest update. While the change technically makes Galactus <em>more</em> powerful, it also makes his game-shaking effect more conditional.</p><p>Since launch, Galactus has been a 6-cost, 2-power card that destroys all of the other locations if it's your only one at the location where it's played. With the new patch, the world-eater has been changed to a 7-power card, but it will only destroy the other locations if it's your only card <em>and</em> you're winning that location.</p><p>The change means that the counter to Galactus changes significantly. Before, the most effective method to counter Galactus was to place cards on your opponent's side with Debrii or pull Galactus out of its intended location with Aero. In lengthy patch notes explaining the change, developer Second Dinner said that his win-rate was too high, and even players who successfully countered him didn't really enjoy the experience. The studio says that it hopes this change will make countering Galactus more about competing for power level, which is the core play mechanic of Marvel Snap. With this condition his power level can also be further adjusted if the balance swings too far in either direction.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/galactus-the-nuisance-of-marvel-snap-has-finally-been-nerfed/1100-6515220/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>A fourth Spider-Man movie starring Tom Holland is on the way, but Holland is feeling "a little apprehensive about it." Speaking to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/tom-holland-the-crowded-room-future-spider-man-1235514347/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Holland said part of him wants to walk away now because he would be going out on a high note.</p><p>"There's a bit of a stigma about the fourth one in all franchises. I feel like we hit a home run with our first franchise and there's a part of me that wants to walk away with my head held high and pass the baton to the next lucky kid that gets to bring this character to life," Holland said.</p><p>Also in the interview, Holland made it clear that, after meeting with Marvel to discuss the next Spider-Man movie, he is feeling "really, really happy" about where it's headed. So it sounds like he will not walk away, but is at least having those thoughts inside his head. He might also be contractually obligated to keep making Spider-Man movies.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tom-holland-talks-spider-man-4-and-why-he-thought-about-walking-away/1100-6515219/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Warner Bros. is trying to woo back Batman director Christopher Nolan after the director parted ways with the film studio following his 2020 movie Tenet. This included paying Nolan a seven-figure check (meaning somewhere in the range of $1 million-$10 million), according to a report.</p><p>For some quick context, Nolan and WB worked together for years on the Batman movies, Inception, Interstellar, and more, but the relationship ended with Tenet. Nolan called WB's streaming service, then known as HBO Max, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tenet-director-christopher-nolan-speaks-out-against-wbs-decision-to-put-movies-on-hbo-max/1100-6485213/">"worst streaming service,"</a> after WB elected to put Tenet in theaters <em>and </em>on streaming due to the pandemic.

<p>Warner Bros. is making new Lord of the Rings movies, and in a development that might be exciting to longtime fans, it appears the studio is trying to woo back Peter Jackson.</p><p>Jackson was the director and co-writer on the Oscar-winning Lord of the Rings film trilogy from the early 2000s. He also made the three Hobbit movies, though they were less critically adored. <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/features/warner-bros-christopher-nolan-film-execs-new-strategy-interview-1235642666/">According to Variety</a>, Warner Bros. Film Group co-CEOs Michael De Luca and Pam Abdy flew to New Zealand to visit Jackson to "reestablish the studio's connection" with him.</p><p>That's all the report had to say, but in any event, fans of the fantasy series are probably happy to hear that Jackson is at least in the discussion for the new Lord of the Rings films. We have no idea how those discussions went, however.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-lord-of-the-rings-movie-gets-exciting-development-update/1100-6515209/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Cyberpunk 2077 PC Specs Increased Ahead Of Phantom Liberty, Now Requires SSD

<p dir="ltr">Cyberpunk 2077 has a reputation as a demanding game on PC, and developer CD Projekt Red has <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/48271/update-to-pc-system-requirements">revised</a> the game's system requirements to reflect that ahead of its coming expansion, Phantom Liberty. The updated specs tie specific GPUs and processors to resolution and target frame rates, but as the blog announcing the change clarifies, that doesn't mean you're guaranteed to get that level of performance.</p><p dir="ltr">The biggest change here is that an SSD is now required to meet the game's minimum specs. Many PC gamers have at least one these days, but if you don't, it's definitely worth the upgrade. The upcoming Starfield will also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-pc-specs-have-been-revealed-and-youll-need-an-ssd-to-play/1100-6515087/">require an SSD</a> to run on PC. It's also worth noting here that these revised requirements don't necessarily mean that low-end machines won't be able to run the game, but CD Projekt Red says that they're officially "discontinuing active support" for those sort of specs, so keep that in mind.</p><p>Cyberpunk 2077's expansion <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-release-date-revealed-with-new-gameplay-trailer/1100-6514830/">Phantom Liberty</a> releases on September 26. It's described as a "spy-thriller" themed add-on.

<p>Most games set in <em>ye olden </em>times are focused on the clash of kingdoms, brutal warfare, and the sound of steel-on-steel violence, but for something different, the Crusader Kings series is a fascinating diversion.

Like other GOG games, this is a DRM-free game and you'll be able to download and install it without needing to be online to play it.</p><p>There's also <em>a lot </em>of DLC for Crusader Kings II, although you'll need to pay up if you want them.

<p>Lego 2K Goooal! has been rated by the Game Rating and Administration Committee of Korea.

It hasn't been officially announced yet, but with a rating appearing, it could be soon. VGC's report included an unannounced open-world racing game at the time, which was the recently released Lego 2K Drive.</p><p>There is a third game reportedly coming too, based on a major sports franchise. Furthermore, these games reportedly will have guest characters from other popular licenses like Marvel, DC, and Harry Potter.

## Next-Gen Games Still Can't Hold A Candle To The Wow Factor Of Altered Beast

<p dir="ltr"><em>Altered Beast is celebrating its 35-year anniversary today, June 14, 2023. Below, we look back at why the highly derided game is so memorable to a generation of gamers.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Altered Beast is one of those games that most hardcore gamers know and probably don't actually like. Most retrospectives focus on how terriblly it's aged, a legacy cemented by a couple of atrocious sequels on the GBA and PS2. And yet somehow, it's a game that is still considered an undeniable classic. So why is a game so widely regarded as a joke still enjoy such high name identification? Like many games that awkwardly found their footing when the medium was in its infancy, the shortest answer is "you had to be there."</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike poorly aged breakthrough games like Adventure or the original Street Fighter, Altered Beast doesn't have the easy cultural cache of being the first at anything, aside from being the very first Genesis game ever produced. But anyone who was a self-aware gamer at the time remembers the first time they heard Zeus-as-played-by-Elmer-Fudd telling our nameless Roman champion player character to "wise fwom his gwave". Everyone laughs now, but at the time? It sounded like the future being born. It's hard to really explain to anyone younger than 35 what lo-fi voices coming out of a video game in your home felt like in the '80s. Arcade games had been doing it for some years, of course, but the gulf between what arcade games were doing and what home consoles were capable of was enormous. Playing a game on your NES was lighting a firecracker in your backyard. Arcade games felt like NASA.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-gen-games-still-cant-hold-a-candle-to-the-wow-factor-of-altered-beast/1100-6515169/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Diablo 4's Ridiculous Skin Prices Are Just A Reminder We Live In Microtransaction Hell

<p dir="ltr">Microtransactions have been a significant and accepted part of gaming for well over a decade, but every now and then players will encounter something that makes their hair stand on end. The recently released mega-hit Diablo IV served as the catalyst for this most recent MTX controversy, as players went online to complain about high prices for the game's cosmetic loot. But though we may huff and puff about battle passes and $20 suits of armor all we want--because it really does seem that every major game has to be stuffed to the gills with extra revenue streams these days--it's not clear if there's an alternative we can boost as a better option.</p><p dir="ltr">To be fair, I think players have a right to be upset here. By all accounts, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/diablo-4-review-mother-knows-best/1900-6418072/">Diablo IV is a great game</a>, more than earning its premium $70 price point through its in-depth loot systems and compulsive gameplay loop. The fact that the game then has an in-game shop that prompts you to spend 2500 Platinum (or $20) on the "Triune Apostate" armor is a crude reminder of the secondary purchases that have become increasingly unavoidable in today's video game market. Want a shinier mount? You can earn some through play, but if you want all of them to choose from, that'll run you $8 apiece.</p><p dir="ltr">One fan <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/13zkmxn/the_price_to_buy_every_cosmetic/">calculated</a> that the game's current cosmetics would run you $357 to net everything, a figure that somehow seems low by current standards. And all this precedes the rollout of the game's battle pass model, which will be the real test of how much content Diablo IV will lock behind a recurring real-money payment. In 2006, Oblivion's $2 Horse Armor DLC was <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/horse-armor">an internet meme</a>, a cheap joke at the expense of those who would throw away their money for something so trifling. Today, Diablo's skins are 10 times that price, and many players just accept it as a normal part of AAA gaming. After all, what can we really do about it?</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-ridiculous-skin-prices-are-just-a-reminder-we-live-in-microtransaction-hell/1100-6515201/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>A federal court has issued a restraining restraining order that will prevent Microsoft from completing its acquisition of Activision-Blizzard until it can consider a preliminary injunction requested by the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ftc-to-seek-injunction-halting-microsoft-activision-deal-and-the-xbox-company-is-happy-about-it/1100-6515127/">Federal Trade Commission</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/13/23760192/microsoft-activision-blizzard-tro-granted-ftc-injunction">The Verge</a> reports.</p><p>While the FTC is attempting to stop Microsoft from finalizing its deal before the deadline of July 18, Microsoft stated that the injunction was a good thing, as it would speed up the legal process.</p><p>The restraining order means Microsoft can't complete its acquisition of Activision until "after 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time on the fifth business day after the Court rules on the FTC’s request for a preliminary injunction." If the injuction is also granted at that time, it means that the FTC will be able to argue its case in court before Microsoft is able to complete its deal.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/judge-grants-restraining-order-temporarily-preventing-microsoft-from-buying-activision/1100-6515204/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Blizzard has released its ninth <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo IV</a> hotfix since the game released last week, and it contains a nerf for elite monster spawns in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-power-leveling-guide-how-to-go-from-1-to-50-in-under-an-hour/1100-6515181/">popular XP farming dungeons</a>. Fans aren't too happy about the change, pointing out that the nerfed dungeons were some of the most enjoyable to run in the game.</p><p>Previous Diablo hotfixes have tweaked spawn rates to try and balance overly-popular dungeons, with the last six fixes containing "further adjustments to Elite monster rates in dungeons." The most recent patch also comes with a developer note, which adds, "we are standardizing the density of elite monsters that spawn in dungeons to ensure that no particular dungeon is clearly more efficient to run through than others."</p><p>Players aren't happy with the change, with many expressing frustration in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/148pfnf/hotfix_9_june_13/">Reddit thread</a> that Blizzard chose to nerf spawn rates for its most popular dungeons, rather than increasing rates for the less popular ones. Fans agree that blasting through large mobs is Diablo IV at its most fun, with standard dungeon spawn rates often feeling underwhelming.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-hotfix-nerfs-dungeons-used-for-power-leveling/1100-6515203/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## The Walking Dead: Dead City Review - New York, Same Mistakes

<p dir="ltr">The Walking Dead is over, after 11 seasons and more than 100 episodes. That's old news, of course. But in its place, AMC is expanding what it calls The Walking Dead Universe (TWDU), following a Marvel-like roadmap of interlinked storylines and characters so that those who are in for a penny may be in for a pound. But as the first of these post-mainline projects, Dead City makes some of the same mistakes the main show committed too often. What could've been an interesting coda for Maggie and Negan is instead an overt ploy to keep TWD fans subscribed to AMC's subscription service.</p><p dir="ltr">Cynically, one could argue all content is just that. <a href="https://www.theonion.com/please-click-on-our-websites-banner-ads-1819584792">My favorite Onion article</a> says as much. But some artistic enterprises hide it better than others. As a six-episode first season, my hope was Dead City would serve as a way to hone in on two characters I still find very compelling. But the season meanders between its first and last episodes--a TWD staple--spending too much time on characters we only just met and who feel inauthentic and unnteresting. I ought not slight the endeavor for not serving as an epilogue. I should critique what it <em>is</em>, not what I <em>want</em> it to be. But even as the first chapter of what is clearly designed to go on longer, it just doesn't work, despite some occasional moments that pull on my deep appreciation for its main duo.</p><p dir="ltr">In Dead City, a few years have passed since the mainline finale. Maggie has tracked down Negan to the outskirts of Manhattan after a former disciple of his nicknamed The Croat--who is retconned to have left Sanctuary before the events of The Walking Dead--has kidnapped Hershel using similar methods that Negan used to employ when the Saviors were bullying everyone just south of the Mason-Dixon Line. To Maggie, Negan's familiarity with the villain and his undeniable craftiness make him a necessary accomplice in her trek to save her son. For Negan, Maggie offers his new ward, a voluntarily mute young girl named Ginny, and a safe haven at The Bricks, which is basically Hilltop North.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-walking-dead-dead-city-review-new-york-same-mistakes/1900-6418078/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
