<p>The Irish comedian on good gigs, bad gigs, her standup heroes and what makes a good soup</p><p><strong>How did you get your start in standup?<br /></strong>I did work experience at a radio station when I was in college. The breakfast DJ was Bernard O’Shea, a big comedian in Ireland. He told me I should try standup because I was always joking around in the office, but I ignored him. Then he booked a gig [for me] to MC and I had two weeks to prepare. The piece of advice he gave me was to write five minutes, start with what you think is your strongest joke and end with your second strongest, whatever you’re not sure about, put it in the middle. I just had these long anecdotes about my granny. I’d never had that feeling of adrenaline before and I’m constantly chasing that.</p><p><strong>Who inspired you when you were first starting out?<br /></strong>I remember watching Ava Vidal on TV and thought she was very funny. When I went to college, a guy in my class who was into standup made me a mixtape of comedy which had Chris Rock and Maria Bamford who was the greatest thing I’d ever heard in my life.</p><p>Alison Spittle: Soup is at <a href="https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/alison-spittle-soup">Monkey Barrel, Edinburgh</a>, 2-27 August</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/14/alison-spittle-think-of-the-most-shameful-thing-you-have-done-then-imagine-your-mum-watching">Continue reading...</a>

## Gogol Bordello’s Eugene Hütz: ‘Ukraine earned its hardcore status’

<p>The Ukrainian musician discusses his new documentary that traces his history along with that of his homeland and the Russian invasion</p><p>Ukrainian-born musician Eugene Hütz, leader of the New York-bred band Gogol Bordello, readily admits he first found it shocking when he came across images of his old friends armed to the teeth in battle in the current war with Russia. “It was particularly alarming that somebody you used to jam and rock out with is now on TikTok with a rocket launcher,” he said. “But after that initial blow, it quickly settled in that this is part of the historical DNA of Ukrainians. Being a self-sufficient warrior is at the center of our identity. This has always been in us.”</p><p>Hütz’s life epitomizes that. His defiant spirit began in childhood, when his family struggled to resist the soul-crushing influence of the then Soviet Union in the 70s and 80s. Starting in adolescence, he found a voice for his maverick character in punk rock, leading him to play in hardcore bands in Ukraine before emigrating in the 90s to America, where he eventually formed Gogol Bordello in New York. The arc of his story provides a personal hook for a new documentary, Scream of My Blood, only to place it in the far broader context of Ukraine’s history of resistance as well as the current battle for its right to exist. “My life story is used as a vehicle to tell the story of a people,” Hütz said.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/14/gogol-bordello-eugene-hutz-ukraine">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The former behemoth wants to merge with Three but such a fundamental change in the UK telecoms market must come with a 5G guarantee</p><p>Once upon a time, Vodafone was the biggest beast in the global telecoms jungle – indeed, it was also the UK’s biggest company by stock market value around the turn of the century.

London nightclub owner and criminal who helped fellow crooks evade justice on the ‘Costa del Crime’ in Spain<p>Ronnie Knight, the former London club owner, wide boy, convicted criminal and ex-husband of the actor <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/dec/11/dame-barbara-windsor-obituary" title="">Barbara Windsor</a>, played as big a part as anyone in establishing the south of Spain as the “Costa del Crime”. For many years he acted as an unofficial consul for British criminals seeking a home away from the bothersome gaze of the police.</p><p>Knight, who has died aged 89, first came to public attention in the 1960s through his marriage to Windsor, then a rising star of musicals, whom he had started dating while still married to his childhood sweetheart June, the mother of his two children. He dabbled in various illegal enterprises, including a Soho peep-show business, although some of the large profits had to be handed over to corrupt Scotland Yard detectives. A very sociable if flash character, he found his metier running the Artistes and Repertoire nightclub in London, which changed its name to the A&amp;R. It became a hang-out for members of showbusiness and the underworld, reflecting the mutual fascination between those two worlds in the 60s and 70s.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/14/ronnie-knight-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

He was one of a small band of setters who also regularly set puzzles for the four other British “broadsheet” newspapers: as Dante for the Financial Times, Icarus for the Independent and, anonymously, for the Times and the Telegraph. For more than 20 years he was the crossword editor of the Birmingham Post.

## Nauseating, hateful TV: how The Idol has single-handedly resurrected torture porn

<p>Sam Levinson’s miserable drama despises its characters – and its audience. What an utterly gruelling exercise in revelling in a protagonist’s pain</p><p>‘Torture porn”, like all pornography, is hard to define, but as the US supreme court judge Potter Stewart once said, “I know it when I see it.” It is content designed to repulse, disturb and shock without narrative or artistic merit. The term “torture porn” became popularised around 20 years ago in the mid-2000s, when – after the success of Saw – cinemas were rife with films such as Hostel 1 and 2, which saw young tourists tortured by death cults. The Human Centipede featured other tourists stitched together anus to mouth, while A Serbian Film depicted a man being drugged and made to commit unspeakable acts by yet another death cult.</p><p>Eventually, the fashion for extreme brutality died down, only for horror to become “elevated” – and emphasise dramatic elements and metaphors over gore. Until The Idol, that is. The drama stars Lily-Rose Depp as a pop singer attempting a comeback, who is taken in by a slippery Svengali (the Weeknd, a Grammy-winning musician). It may not contain death cults or severed limbs (yet), but it is so commited to artlessly making its protagonist suffer that it has single-handedly resurrected torture porn.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/14/nauseating-hateful-tv-how-the-idol-has-single-handedly-resurrected-torture-porn">Continue reading...</a>

She talks about reimagining early years care as part of the education system, which makes it sound universal and free. But she also references Estonia as a model, where parents are guaranteed nursery places, but pay according to their means. The quality of the care is high, wages and qualifications are higher, and the sector is seen as a critical element of child development. This is in contrast to the Liz Truss and Jeremy Hunt model, where nursery is a place to park your child while you earn money, so the drive in the sector is to keep wages low and child:staff ratios high.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/14/labour-tory-uncosted-policies-free-childcare-green-new-deal">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Early 1960s Liverpudlian pop may have been dominated by the Beatles, but it was a thriving scene whose acts filled the charts. Its artists explain why wild success gave way to heartbreaking failure</p><p>Thriving locally in Liverpool in 1961, dominating the charts by 1963 and all but over by 1965, Merseybeat was a short-lived phenomenon that reverberated around the world. The sound of young working-class Liverpudlians recasting their love of American R&amp;B, rock’n’roll and doo-wop in their own image, it was the scene that birthed the Beatles – whose debut album recently turned 60 – alongside other stars like Gerry and the Pacemakers, Cilla Black and the Searchers, becoming the UK’s first significant contribution to pop music history. It inspired similar scenes across the UK and beyond, and was sold back to Americans in the British Invasion. “It felt like something was about to happen,” remembers Billy J Kramer, who had two No 1 hits with his backing band the Dakotas. “But it was just an explosion. Liverpool was at the centre of things out of nowhere.”</p><p>Merseybeat had its roots in the late 1950s. Always a musical city, jazz and skiffle were the popular sounds of the day until an influx of the latest, hard-to-find American rock’n’roll records and instruments were imported into Liverpool from the US via its docks, changing the pulse of the city. “The place was buzzing with it,” says Nick Crouch of Faron’s Flamingos and the Mojos (two of the bands included on a new Merseybeat compilation, Let’s Stomp! Merseybeat and Beyond 1962-1969). “Virtually every street you walked down, you’d hear guitar music.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/14/john-lennon-the-inside-story-of-merseybeat-pop-explosion-beatles-gerry-and-the-pacemakers">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A couple rely on each other for survival on a post-apocalyptic island, in this darkly unsettling tale</p><p>Natasha Calder’s debut opens with a slippery declaration: “As far as I’m concerned, it begins like this.” We’re immediately immersed in Kit’s consciousness – her strange, febrile voice sweeps the story along in mysterious pulses and beats. The unreliable narrator trope is in full force here.</p><p>Kit lives with Crevan in a castle on an abandoned island. It’s clear that they rely on one another for survival, and that they are sheltering from unrest in the wider world. The island is, fortunately, stocked with supplies, including food and clothes. There’s also a vast cedar cupboard; Kit must never open Crevan’s side, which contains a secret. Kit and Crevan have an intense, symbiotic relationship, which at times seems romantic, at others parental.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/14/whether-violent-or-natural-by-natasha-calder-review-visions-of-a-toxic-eden">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The new Spurs manager needs a goalkeeper, defender and midfielder to strengthen the spine of his disjointed team</p><p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/BenMcAleer1">Ben McAleer</a> for <a href="http://www.whoscored.com/">WhoScored</a></p><p>“It’s an exciting opportunity for us to set off in a new direction, play football and create an environment that embodies the values and traditions of this fantastic football club, hopefully a team you can all be proud of and, more importantly, get excited by.” Ange Postecoglou certainly talked the talk in his first message to Tottenham fans following <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/06/tottenham-confirm-ange-postecoglous-appointment-as-manager">his appointment as Antonio Conte’s successor</a>.</p><p>Now comes the hard part of walking the walk and leading what has become a disjointed and dejected group of players. Tottenham finished eighth in the Premier League, which means they will have no European football for the first time since the 2009-10 campaign. That being said, this means that Spurs can focus on domestic duties, easing the pressure on Postecoglou in his first season in England. Not playing in Europe can have its advantages – as shown by Liverpool in 2013-14, Leicester in 2015-16, Chelsea in 2016-17 and even Newcastle in the season just finished.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/who-scored-blog/2023/jun/14/tottenham-players-ange-postecoglou-sign-summer">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I’ve seen trees around the country threatened by development, bulldozers and chainsaws. Now it is happening on my doorstep</p><p>I live near a group of beautiful, mature trees that spread across a corner of two residential roads; they are a community hub, providing a shady place to sit and chat. They are much loved, all covered by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/23/tree-felling-punishable-jail-term-uncapped-fines">tree protection orders</a>, and provided as a gift in perpetuity to the community in the 1980s as a planning condition for the creation of a business park. Forty years on, none of this seems to matter. Where bricks and mortar and making money are concerned, trees have no voice: they die silently, even amid a climate emergency that now brings extreme temperatures to London and the south-east with alarming regularity.</p><p>After years <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/15/a-disgrace-more-than-100-trees-cut-down-in-plymouth-despite-local-opposition">reporting on the battles</a> of ordinary people to protect trees from bulldozers and chainsaws, I find myself in the midst of one. It is an emotionally sapping, frustrating fight against developers who want to destroy the trees and build luxury homes. It does not seem to matter that the council in question, Richmond upon Thames, a Liberal Democrat-run borough with a strong collection of Green councillors, <a href="https://www.richmond.gov.uk/news/press_office/campaigns_and_events/climate_emergency/how_we_can_tackle_climate_change/what_are_we_doing_about_climate_change#:~:text=Richmond%20Climate%20Week-,Climate%20Change%20Strategy%20and%20Action%20Plan,(pdf%2C%20515%20KB).">declared a climate emergency</a> in 2019. Nor that it launched its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtdKb4fbxh0">biodiversity action plan</a> with much fanfare at a May 2019 event where the star speaker was David Attenborough, a local resident.

<p>Latifa Khamessi’s parents prohibited her from dancing. Now, after years apart, she and her son Mohamed Toukabri share the stage for a duet</p><p>As a teenager in 1970s Tunis, Latifa Khamessi used to sneak out to discos. Her parents didn’t approve. One time they punished her by shaving her hair off, but Khamessi went to her hairdresser and got a wig. Then they hid her dresses, so she wore one of her brother’s shirts instead. She had a rebellious spirit, but mostly Khamessi just loved to dance, releasing her energy and frustrations on the dancefloor. “It was a moment of transformation,” she says. Even when she was pregnant with her first son, her husband would take her out dancing. She dreamed of being a dancer, but it wasn’t a viable or respectable career.</p><p>Now, 65-year-old Khamessi has finally made it to the stage with her son Mohamed Toukabri – the one who went to discos in utero and became a professional dancer. He tells people he got the bug after watching breakers dance to hip-hop outside Tunis’s railway station, but now he realises “it was all there all along, transmitted to me somehow”.</p><p>The Power (of) the Fragile is part of <a href="https://www.shubbak.co.uk/festival-2023/">Shubbak festival</a> at <a href="https://bac.org.uk/whats-on/the-power-of-the-fragile/">Battersea Arts Centre, London</a>, 27-29 June, and at the <a href="https://thelowry.com/whats-on/mohamed-toukabri-the-power-of-the-fragile/">Lowry, Salford</a>, 1 July</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/14/we-had-both-grown-up-but-we-didnt-know-each-other-real-life-mother-and-son-on-dancing-together-shubakk-fesitval-battersea-arts-centre-london">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The newly popular mix of hiking and open-water swimming opens up new routes for adventurers looking to explore mountains, lakes and coasts</p><p>Cross-country swimming – the combination of hiking and open-water swimming – enables you to create routes that traverse land and water, whether it be mountains, lakes or a stretch of coastline. The concept is that when your walk comes to a body of water, you pack your kit into a waterproof inflatable bag that can be towed, swim to the next destination, exit, and continue your journey. A multi-swim walk can open up new perspectives on the landscape, even in familiar areas.</p><p>Standard <a href="https://www.outdoorswimmingsociety.com/tow-float-or-not-tow-float/">tow floats</a> are fine for shorter trips.

<p>After months of bitter divisions in the world of professional golf, a major deal has resulted in victory for Saudi Arabia and its bid to influence the future of the sport. Ewan Murray reports</p><p>For years professional golf has been a lucrative but fairly placid affair. That all changed with the advent of LIV golf – a new entity that encouraged some of the sport’s biggest names to play its new-format tournaments and sign multi-million dollar contracts. It was lavishly backed by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund and it left the world of professional golf reeling. Friendships ended as players either signed up for the new competitions or decided to stay loyal to their traditional paymasters, the PGA tour.</p><p>As golf correspondent <strong>Ewan Murray </strong>tells <strong>Michael Safi, </strong>when the two sides put aside their bitter differences last week to announce a merger, it came completely out of the blue. Now with peace agreed and a massive cash injection beckoning, is the future of golf in safe hands?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/jun/14/how-saudi-arabia-took-over-professional-golf-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
