While FromSoftware has grown notorious for Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Sekiro, and of course, Elden Ring, they have a library of other pre-Hidetaka Miyazai era games with large fanbases, including King's Field, and of course, Armored Core. Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon will be the first new Armored Core game since Miyazaki took over as president of FromSoftware. Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon is currently set to release to PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC August 25, 2023.
