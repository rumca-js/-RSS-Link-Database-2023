On June 14th, 2023 -- Day 780ish to flatten the curve -- at around 1:45 PM eastern, Democrat Congressman Jerry Nadler took to the floor of Congress and said the following:</p><blockquote><em>Two-year-olds should have been required to wear masks. It would be child abuse for parents not to do this. The only way to protect them against Covid was to have them wear masks. These mandates are meant to protect the public's health and safety.</em></blockquote><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">Nadler: \"When we have a pandemic like covid, two-year-olds should have been required to wear masks.

After attempting to destroy his career and being found a lying liar who lies by a jury of her peers, Heard (aka Amber Turd) paid Johnny Depp the defamation money she owed him. Or, the insurance company has. For some odd reason, every story I read on the matter specifics that.</p><p>And as one final f*ck you to his ex-wife, Depp gave all the money away.

Because she is a girl and Depp is not, he <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/uh-oh-johnny-depp-may-actually-be-the-victim-of-amber-heards-domestic-abuse\" target=\"_self\">was deemed guilty by the entertainment industry</a>. </p><p>As we now know <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/amber-heard-portnoy-wapo\" target=\"_self\">a lawsuit and a $15 million settlement later</a>, Heard lied about all of it. She also <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/amber-heard-johnny-depp-fecal\" target=\"_self\">may or may not have left a poop in their bed</a>. Whether it was her poop, the dog's poop, or the dog's poop that she put in the bed... that was not made clear by a jury of her peers.</p><p>Depp <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/13/entertainment/johnny-depp-settlement-charities/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">agreed in December 2022</a> to settle for $1 million. He made his point. Amber Turd still swears she did nothing wrong and that this waa not an admission of guilt.</p><h3>What charities are Johnny Depp donating too?</h3><br /><p>TMZ reports that five charities are getting are getting $200,000 each.</p><p>Make-A-Film. It's similar to Make-A-Wish, only it grants wishes to sick kids who want to be in the film industry.</p><p>Paul Newman's Painted Turtle and Marlon Brando's Tetiaroa Society, to pay tribute to two of Depp's acting heroes. As an aside, Depp's movie with Brando <em>Don Juan DeMarco</em> is one of my favorites of his.</p><p>And then two charities to help indigenous people, Red Feather and Amazonia.</p><p class=\"\">And scene. America can put this ordeal behind us a heel again.</p><p>Depp can get back to making movies. Turd can I guess do the same.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

His primary means of interfacing with all the devices and automations is through Amazon Echo devices. One day his devices went unresponsive. And when he asked Alexa what was wrong, she said \"Nothing.\"</p><blockquote>The [Amazon] representative told me I should have received an email, which I indeed found in my inbox. It was from an executive at Amazon. As I dialed the number provided in the email, I half-wondered if Amazon was experiencing some issues and I was unwittingly falling into a scam.</blockquote><blockquote>When I connected with the executive, they asked if I knew why my account had been locked. When I answered I was unsure, their tone turned somewhat accusatory. I was told that the driver who had delivered my package reported receiving racist remarks from my \u201cRing doorbell.\u201d</blockquote><p>Here's the rub... no one was home at the time. And it wasn't a Ring doorbell, it was a different brand. That doorbell's automated response when the Amazon driver dropped off packages was \u201cExcuse me, can I help you?\u201d The driver, who was wearing headphones, claimed he heard something else. He even provided video evidence of this, but Amazon did not care.</p><blockquote>The timing couldn\u2019t have been worse: the onset of Labor Day weekend was approaching, and I was keen to resolve the issue before the long weekend. However, despite numerous calls and emails, it wasn\u2019t until Friday afternoon that I received confirmation that the investigation had started. I was told to expect a response within two business days, meaning not until Tuesday of the following week at the earliest.</blockquote><p>His account was finally unlocked the next Wednesday.</p><p>We have seen other examples of this: <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/xcel-energy-thermostats\" target=\"_blank\">a \"smart\" thermostat shutting a man out of lowering his air conditioning (for schlimate change reasons)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tesla-sends-warning-owners\" target=\"_blank\">Tesla sending GOVERNMENT MESSAGES to all cars about \"the strong suggestion\" to conserve electricity</a>, etc. This example is the most extreme. And while it would have still been bullsh*t even had the man said a mean word to the driver, the fact the man wasn't even home makes it worse.</p><p>Today it's a driver claiming to have heard something he didn't hear. What when it's a customer who expressed an opinion online that corporate Amazon employees don't like? As it is, you don't even have to write a \"problematic\" post yourself to get canceled these days. <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/toronto-blue-jays-pride-weekend\" target=\"_blank\">You only need to like someone else's</a>.</p><p>This is the world progressives want for you. It's why their vision of a cashless society or \"owning nothing and liking it\" is terrifying. They WANT to be able to shut you down on a whim. Today it's someone claiming you said a bad word (that you weren't home to say). Tomorrow it will be a social media post. Or spreading what others claim is \"misinformation.\"</p><p>With a snap of the fingers, this man lost the use of the items HE OWNS. All over a misunderstanding. You can just as easily be locked out of your \"smart\" home for the same.</p><p>Pay attention, America.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

It was clear the reporter was talking about competing in school sports. Just like it would be dangerous if your daughter was competing against a much stronger boy in school sports, parents are concerned about competing against transgender girls for the same reason. Because those transgender girls are really... you know, the thing.\n</p><p>\n\tThe <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/volleyball-player-north-carolina\" target=\"_blank\">latest example is Payton McNabb</a>, a female North Carolina teen, who got concussed when a transgender \"female\" spiked a ball in her face in volleyball.
