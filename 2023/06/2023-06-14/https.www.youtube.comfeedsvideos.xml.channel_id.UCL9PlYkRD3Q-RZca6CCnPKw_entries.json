Project Veritas captured these admissions by Martin Uli on video, utilizing undercover journalism.\n\nThe lease document obtained by Project Veritas reveals a proposed deal between Rapid Reliable Testing NY, LLC (\u201cDocGo\u201d) and Palisades EOM LLC for $6,241,500 per year for five years to rent the rooms totaling $31,207,500.\n\nNYC uses DocGo to contract with hotels. DocGo has been the subject of Project Veritas in 2022 reporting which investigated their role in administering the COVID-19 vaccine to children in New York City.\n\nUli admits on camera that if the money had been better spread around, there would have been less resistance to the Mayor\u2019s scheme, \u201c...if Rockland was getting a piece of the pie, they would not have sent the health inspectors to that hotel.\u201d\n\n\u2022   MARTIN ULI, ASSISTANT COURT ATTORNEY, HONORABLE THOMAS P. ZUGIBE, ROCKLAND CO COURTHOUSE, ROCKLAND, NY:\n\u201cBasically, the county of Rockland is just trying to keep them shut down because they don\u2019t want them to operate.  So, the hotel is saying that, \u2018There\u2019s really no reason because it\u2019s illegal for us to operate as anything other than a hotel,\u2019 and they\u2019re [Rockland County] just like, finding health violations.  Loose nails.  Stuff like that.\u201d\n\n\u2022  MARTIN ULI:\n\u201cThe illegal part is they can\u2019t operate, like under zoning restrictions.  They can\u2019t be anything else other than a hotel.\u201d\n\n\u2022  MARTIN ULI:\n\u201cYeah.  Yeah, because they\u2019re trying to turn it into a homeless shelter, like a migrant facility, and under zoning laws you can\u2019t turn it into anything other than a hotel.\u201d\n\n\u2022  PROJECT VERITAS JOURNALIST:\n\u201cOkay, and who\u2019s making the case to turn it into that?\u201d\n\n\u2022  MARTIN ULI:\n\u201cNew York City.  Mayor Adams.\u201d\n\n\u2022  PATRICK FRENCH, HEAD OF MAINTENANCE, ARMONI INN & SUITES, ORANGEBURG, NY:\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why Ashok took that deal, man.  He should never take that deal.  He\u2019s just watching the money.\u201d\n\nAre you aware of this happening in your area?
