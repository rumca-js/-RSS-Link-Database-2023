Home Alone and it's sequel Lost in New York are widely considered two of the best holiday movies ever made.  There is a certain charm around Macaulay Culkin's portrayal of Kevin Mccallister and audiences instantly connected with it.  Though as time went on, studios attempted to capitalize on the popularity of the Home Alone brand, but it failed spectacularly.  Home Alone without Kevin Mccallister just isn't Home Alone.
