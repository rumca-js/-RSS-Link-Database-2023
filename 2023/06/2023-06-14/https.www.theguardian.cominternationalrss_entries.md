<p>Huge crowds of protesters marched along the streets of Warsaw on Wednesday evening demanding the legalisation of abortion, after a pregnant woman’s death in a hospital in May. Dorota Lalik died of septic shock in a hospital after her waters broke in the 20th week of pregnancy. On Monday, Poland’s patients’ rights ombudsman said the hospital should have told her that her life could be saved through an abortion.

## Tish review – gripping portrait of a passionate photographer of Austerity Britain

<p>Tish Murtha, who lived a life as tough as those she shot in different eras of deprivation and marginalisation, receives a wholehearted and riveting tribute</p><p>There’s passion in this heartrending documentary from film-maker Paul Sng, comparable to his excellent earlier film <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/mar/05/poly-styrene-i-am-a-cliche-review-x-ray-spex-singer-film">about Poly Styrene, of X-Ray Spex</a>. It is about the Tyneside photographer Tish Murtha who chronicled working-class lives in the north east in the 70s and 80s (and also those of Soho sex workers in London), earning for herself the nickname “Demon Snapper” in the papers.</p><p>She showed the reality of poverty and deprivation in communities where the misery of unemployment had been allowed to settle by the Westminster political classes who considered it a price worth other people paying for the boon of undermining trade union power. But in capturing the faces, particularly the faces of children, Murtha showed her subjects’ humour, optimism and refusal to be cowed. The film is presented with enormous humanity and warmth by Murtha’s grownup daughter Ella, who is an eerie likeness of her late mother. It is Ella who mediates the film’s emotional message in talking to Tish Murtha’s relatives and to her friends and teachers at the School of Documentary Photography in Newport.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/14/tish-review-devastating-portrait-of-an-impassionate-photographer-tish-murtha">Continue reading...</a>

## Grandiose? Sure. Lofty? Undoubtedly. But I can’t help admiring Elizabeth Gilbert | Emma Brockes

<p>Perhaps the writer’s decision to withhold publication of her new Russia-set novel isn’t as ridiculous as her critics claim</p><p>Political statements by writers are so common as to practically come with the job description and, no matter how sincerely delivered, often seem timed to ignite interest in a book. Rarer is the writer who takes a stand in total opposition to their commercial interests. On Monday, however, that’s what Elizabeth Gilbert, the novelist and self-help guru, did when she posted a video to social media, outlining her decision to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/12/eat-pray-love-author-withdraws-new-russia-set-novel-from-publication-elizabeth-gilbert-the-snow-forest">withhold publication</a> of her new novel indefinitely in deference to sensitivities around the war in Ukraine. The statement triggered an avalanche of inflamed commentary and scorn, and a reboot of a discussion that has continued, on and off, for decades about Gilbert and what exactly her deal is.</p><p>Gilbert’s novel is set in Russia but has nothing to do with Vladimir Putin. Instead, The Snow Forest follows the fortunes of a family in 1930s Siberia trying to escape the reach of the Soviet government. It also has an environmental theme, highlighting the destruction of the natural world by industrialisation. Nonetheless, as Gilbert outlines in the video, she has received an “enormous, massive outpouring” from her readers in Ukraine, expressing “anger, sorrow, disappointment and pain” at her decision to set a novel in the land of the oppressor. On that basis, she is making a “course correction” and “removing the book from its publication schedule”.</p><p>Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/14/grandiose-lofty-elizabeth-gilbert-russia">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The stereotype of Black characters dying first in horror movies is put to the test in a funny and incisive Juneteenth-set slasher</p><p>There is an august tradition in the African American community of talking back to the film screen loud enough to jolt the characters on screen. The Blackening doesn’t just hear those cries; it needles its crowd for more reactions, bigger this time.</p><p>From Tim Story, the director of Fantastic Four and Ride Along, the film starts with a group of college friends reuniting at a creaky woodland cabin – replete with drinks, drugs and marathon games of Spades. Premiering at last year’s Toronto film festival, Story’s feature releases this weekend pegged to Juneteenth – the emancipation holiday marking its second year in federal observance.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/14/the-blackening-movie-review-horror-juneteenth">Continue reading...</a>

## Drinking alcohol is bad for you. Ignore the headlines that claim otherwise | Adrian Chiles

<p>Another week, another article suggesting that alcohol may have health benefits. It’s amazing how desperate drinkers are to fool themselves</p><p>It’s amazing how easy it is to persuade us that what we want to be true is true. Consider a typical headline to a story covered with great enthusiasm by many major news organisations this week: <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/alcohol-drinking-heart-disease-risk-b2356344.html">“Moderate alcohol consumption may lower stress, reduce heart disease risk, study finds.”</a> Enthusiastic drinkers, drowning in a dark sea of health warnings, will cling on to such words as stricken sailors might hold on to the hull of their capsized boat.</p><p>They will turn a blind eye to the facts of the story, although even the headline itself, with its “may” and its “study finds”, suggests this scientific revelation isn’t quite the slam dunk we might be hoping for. Once the study’s methodology and conclusions are outlined, it’s clear that the whole thing falls into the category of <em>quite interesting</em>, rather than <em>this changes everything</em>. But who needs that level of detail? If I’m so minded, there’s as much information in the headline as I’m ever going to want or need to support my long-cherished pet theory about drinking. “I knew it! I told you so! Drinking helps me deal with stress, ergo it eases the strain on my poor ticker, therefore I’ll live longer and more happily.” I’ll file this fact away along with that one about red wine being good for you, as good as a health drink.</p><p>Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnist. His book The Good Drinker: How I Learned to Love Drinking Less is out now in paperback</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/14/drinking-alcohol-bad-for-you-ignore-headlines-claim-otherwise">Continue reading...</a>

## The US debt-ceiling ‘deal’ was a giant exercise in bipartisan class warfare | Clara Mattei

<p>The elite consensus is clear: spending is fine when it supports military ventures, but bad when it supports social welfare</p><p>The headlines around the debt-ceiling legislation focused on the ability of the US to meet its financial obligations on time and in full through 2024. This was no small accomplishment, especially as it arrived within a forever-fractured political environment and only 18 months from a presidential election.</p><p>But the actual terms of the debt-ceiling legislation reveal a political consensus that is at once troubling and longstanding. While topline US spending will increase this year and next, its increase is reserved almost exclusively for defense and for veterans’ medical care. Other programs, including social welfare and enforcement of the tax code by the IRS, will have their budgets cut. Americans seeking food-stamp benefits will also face increased work requirements – a curiously unrelated throw-in policy that reflects a longstanding wish of Republicans and some Democrats.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/14/us-debt-ceiling-bipartisan-class-warfare">Continue reading...</a>

What a day yesterday was. After becoming the first former president ever to be federally indicted, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> appeared in court in Miami and pleaded not guilty to dozens of federal charges related to the classified government documents found at Mar-a-Lago.

<p>The Golden Knights won the championship on Tuesday.

The Black Knights, the Knights, and the Neon Knights were all among the early choices. But only the Knights made it past the second round of voting, proving less popular than Scorpions and the eventual winner, the Outlaws.

<p><strong>PlayStation 4/5, Xbox, PC; Codemasters/Electronic Arts<br /></strong>One of the finest and longest-running racing sims has had a significant upgrade – and gives you the chance to try the new Las Vegas track before it opens</p><p>Formula One may be the pinnacle of motorsport, but it’s also a soap opera, and with F1 23’s single-player story mode Braking Point, developer Codemasters has run wild with that idea. It follows the ups and downs of the fictional rookie team Konnersport in the 2022 and 2023 seasons, a rollicking rollercoaster of bitchiness and tense relationships, and cleverly casts you as several characters, behind the wheel and in the paddock. It blends nostalgia with some great what-ifs and, running to 17 chapters, is pleasingly substantial.<br /><br />It also offers a great introduction to F1 23’s main Career mode, since it takes in a representative selection of tracks. This year, Career mode and My Team (which casts you as owner of the team as well as a driver) are largely unchanged. Both already did a fine job of replicating the real experience of pursuing a Formula One career, and Codemasters has left well alone.</p><p>If you’re looking for more arcade-style racing, rather than simulation, look to F1 World - the replacement for last year’s F1 Life, which was essentially an egregious excuse to shoehorn loot boxes into the game. F1 World puts you in a generic car, which can be upgraded as you level up, and its set of mini-races and custom race designer offer a gentler way of ease into competitive online racing – and makes a lot more sense than F1 Life did..<br /><br /></p><p>F1 23 is out 16 June; £59.99. The platform tested was Xbox Series X</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jun/14/f1-23-review-a-return-to-racing-form">Continue reading...</a>

## SZA review – voyage of a lifetime with genre-busting R&B superstar

<p><strong>AO Arena, Manchester</strong><br />On an astonishing nautical-themed stage set, the US singer moves elastically between intimate and epic scales, with songs of great candour and versatility</p><p>On the approach to any arena, you can normally get a good sense of the headliner by looking at the people outside. Not so much SZA. The hordes that await the opening night of the American singer’s UK SOS tour are overwhelmingly female, but their subcultural uniform is an incongruous mix: cargo pants and cowboy boots, headscarves and high-contrast mesh, designer slogan T-shirts and grungy babydoll slips. It’s a glorious sight, showing that music really does bring people together.</p><p>Seemingly, this is exactly the way that SZA wants it. If Drake, the Weeknd and Kanye West defined the 2010s with their dark, sad-boy reinventions of gangsta rap, then SZA offered up a feminine side of the narrative, espousing her sass but still succumbing to hunger for social approval and ill-advised intimacy. The first female signee to Top Dawg Entertainment (Kendrick Lamar, ScHoolboy Q, Isaiah Rashad), her debut album Ctrl was a seismic breakthrough – nominated for four Grammys, its bad-bitch anthems still confessed to an insecurity that lay beneath. 2022’s follow-up SOS had the same lyrical brief but an even greater sonic palette, establishing SZA as someone who shares listeners’ ever-diversifying tastes, tapping into anything and everything that moves her.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/14/sza-review-voyage-of-a-lifetime-with-genre-busting-rb-superstar">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Hoard evidence of your greatness’: 10 ways to be much more confident at work

<p>Make people laugh, keep a praise file, deal with your inner critic – and avoid comparison-itis. Here is how to connect with colleagues and feel more positive</p><p>Should you expect to feel confident at work? Or is it normal to feel disillusioned and fed up at least some of the time? I mean, it is work. It is not your life. Amid all the noise and drama about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/aug/06/quiet-quitting-why-doing-the-bare-minimum-at-work-has-gone-global">quiet quitting</a>, generational differences, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/10/what-have-the-past-three-years-taught-us-about-hybrid-working">hybrid working</a> patterns, flexible hours, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/19/the-great-resignation-led-to-big-regrets-so-should-we-all-be-career-committing">“the Great Resignation”</a> and whatever latest workplace trend is in the headlines, there’s a temptation to believe that you need to love your work and feel very confident in it to be a fully functioning member of society. We tend to forget that most people neither love their work nor hate it. They just do it reasonably uneventfully, get paid and then go home. Sometimes that is the definition of professional confidence: getting the job done. But what if that’s not enough?</p><p>According to the UK’s <a href="https://www.roberthalf.co.uk/jobs-confidence-index">Jobs Confidence Index</a>, “job search and progression confidence” rose slightly towards the end of last year, indicating that workers are broadly optimistic about (a) being able to get a job somewhere else if they want to, and (b) being promoted or achieving progression where they are. But the picture is mixed: we may supposedly have relative job stability but earnings are stagnant. In the last quarter of 2022, the UK saw the worst contraction in real earnings since the first quarter of 2009. No wonder a lot of people are not confident in their, er, confidence. How, then, to be<em> just confident enough</em> at work, without getting caught up in unrealistic expectations?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jun/14/10-ways-more-confident-work-colleagues-positive">Continue reading...</a>

<p>These interrupted stories, in fiction and real life, are powerfully moving and key into a universal anxiety</p><p>A missing person is a story that doesn’t end. We grapple to make sense, to decipher, to make meaning out of something so unfathomable. Jon Billman refers to the “purgatorial underworld of the vanished”, a description that makes great sense to me. The missing are caught in an in-between place, not here but not gone. Stories about missing persons respond to this cultural anxiety, their narratives plotting explanations or recovering and remembering the absent souls, refusing their oblivion.</p><p>In my novel <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/tell-me-what-i-am-9780571358779?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article">Tell Me What I Am</a> a woman goes missing, leaving behind her sister and her four-year-old daughter.

<p>Aisling Bea rounds up old school friends to watch the reunited boyband in Athens and, amid the laughs, confront what happened when they last saw them 25 years ago</p><p>A jukebox musical featuring the works of Take That might not ever be one for the cool kids; undoubtedly this is a bit broad, but it’s a splurge of feelgood from director Coky Giedroyc and screenwriter Tim Firth, adapting his own stage show, and it’s at least as enjoyable as the much-hyped Mamma Mia! movies.</p><p>Aisling Bea gives it loads as Rachel, a hardworking NHS nurse who in her teen years was a massive Take That stan (as no one used to say in 1993) along with her four best mates from school. She is astonished one day to be phoned up by the local radio station and told she’s won a luxury all-inclusive deal for her and some guests to fly to Athens and see Take That on a reunion tour. This brings Rachel to a state of orgasmic excitement combined with a nervous breakdown as she realises she must round up the now middle-aged women she hasn’t seen for 25 years and they’ll all have to measure the joys and bittersweet disappointments of their lives against a Take That soundtrack. And she has to confront a painful memory connected to the last time they saw the band live in Manchester.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/14/greatest-days-review-take-that-musical-offers-blast-of-feelgood-reunion-excitement">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There’s an existential question hanging over this series. How many people can England persuade to tune in and watch?</p><p>Even the prime minister has an opinion. He thinks England should pick Moeen Ali, or “that 18-year-old who played that one Test” against Pakistan in the winter, Rehan Ahmed. This time last week they projected pictures of England’s two captains, Ben Stokes and Heather Knight, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2023/06/07/cricket-england-ashes-captains-projected-london-iconic-tower-bridge-18914194/">on to Tower Bridge</a>, 65m high. Bandit is teaching Bluey <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-06-12/bluey-cricket-episode-encapsulates-the-meaning-of-the-game/102467554">the meaning of cricket</a>. The Met Office has forecast a heatwave. They’ve had a million requests for tickets to the fifth Test at the Oval. Glenn McGrath is, of course, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/65560507https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/65560507">predicting it will be 5-0 to Australia</a>. And the talk, everywhere, is about 2005, and <em>that series. </em>Stuart Broad has already mentioned it. So has Ben Stokes. And Ollie Pope.</p><p>If you look with the right kind of eyes, you can see, underneath all the excitement, a certain anxious yearning for this to work. Everyone who cares about this format of the sport wants this series to be a spectacular, and for 2023 to become one of those runaway summers when the public is captivated by the Ashes. The truth is Test cricket needs it. Because the big picture, beyond all the questions about which bowlers England will pick and whether David Warner can still cut it, isn’t pretty to look at. People have been worrying about the state of cricket almost as long as they have been playing it, but just because you’re paranoid and all that. The game really is changing, and the only reason to disagree is that you haven’t been paying attention.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/14/ashes-england-australia-cricket-the-spin">Continue reading...</a>

## Sabrina Carpenter review – pop’s next big thing is best when she lets loose

<p><strong>Barrowland, Glasgow<br /></strong>Leaving behind her Disney discography for stylish soft rock and tongue-in-cheek kitsch, the US star still needs to find a vision for her ballads</p><p>Framed by a huge heart-shaped mirror, as if she’s one of Greta Gerwig’s Barbies, Sabrina Carpenter steps into the spotlight. “Back then I didn’t know who I was, not even in the slightest,” she sighs dramatically. The American singer is reminiscing about her previous UK tour, and setting the scene for Sabrina 2.0, a pop star reborn.</p><p>Last year’s Emails I Can’t Send is her fifth album, but you wouldn’t know it from the setlist. After being cast in a Disney Channel series in 2013, Carpenter released four albums in five years. Tonight the 24-year-old plays 16 songs from Emails – her post-Disney debut – and scarcely touches her earlier material. Her new songs aren’t a wild departure in style – Carpenter’s pop remains an easy blend of R&amp;B, acoustic and country – but you get the sense that she feels far greater ownership over them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/14/sabrina-carpenter-review-pops-next-big-thing-is-best-when-she-lets-loose">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From cameras that mimic homeless bees to extremely cute chicks, it’s an honour to see these sights – but be prepared to witness humanity’s awful consequences for wildlife</p><p>Sitting at home, breath held, earnestly hoping that some tiny animal thousands of miles from your sofa can survive a life-or-death situation: it’s always been one of the eerie pleasures of a wildlife documentary, despite such a reaction being essentially irrational. What does it matter whether that lizard can outrun those snakes? It’s all part of nature. It’s nothing to do with us.</p><p>Well, not any more. The scene that sticks in the mind from Our Planet II, Netflix’s new Attenborough-voiced opus, is of an albatross chick on the tiny Pacific island of Laysan, fighting for life without any predators nearby. The little thing’s opening its beak wide and dry-heaving towards the sand. “There is now so much plastic in our oceans that it reaches the most remote islands on Earth,” says Sir David, as we see the beach strewn with incongruously colourful detritus. The peril the chick is trying to survive is whether or not it can sick up a gobbet of indestructible crud its mother mistook for food.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/14/our-planet-ii-review-so-much-of-david-attenborough-new-show-is-just-astonishing-netflix">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A trucker being blackmailed by a criminal gang has to flee with the 12-year-old girl she was trafficking when the drop-off goes wrong. Cue Morgan Freeman</p><p>Juliette Binoche is incapable of giving a bad performance, but here she is, probably as close as she’ll ever get to a stinker, playing a long-distance lorry driver on the wrong side of the law in Mississippi. For about five minutes there’s novelty watching La Binoche in trucker mode, wearing a bandana and filthy jeans, stomping around yelling “motherfucker” at anyone who messes with her. But, her acting, like everything else in this sluggish crime drama written and directed by Norwegian film-maker Anna Gutto, feels implausible; more like tourism than anything in the real world.</p><p>Binoche plays Sally, a French Canadian we meet on the highway, shooting the breeze over the radio with her friends on the female trucker scene. A film about this community of ballsy women in the male world of trucking, dealing with the seedy truck stops and misogyny, might have gone the distance. Instead the movie shifts to Sally and her brother Dennis (Frank Grillo), who is about to be released from prison.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/14/paradise-highway-review-not-even-juliette-binoche-can-save-this-stinker">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The free agent, preparing to captain Spain against Italy, on his Barça exit, dealing with lies and feelings on the Premier League</p><p>Jordi Alba is scrolling through his phone. “There’s nothing, eh,” he says. The story breaks almost the moment he walks through the door and he hears it here first, told as he enters the room. It’s not official yet and he can’t find anything to confirm it, but it soon will be: Lionel Messi is going to Miami. As for the man who laid on 23 of the Argentinian’s goals, the best left-back Barcelona ever had, the captain of Spain too, there’s no news there either. He doesn’t know where he’s going, not yet. Only that he won’t be here any more.</p><p>“It’s too soon,” Alba says at Barcelona’s Sant Joan Despí training ground. “I’m still getting used to this; it’s not easy to go somewhere else.” A winner of 18 major trophies with club and country, he had never intended to leave the Camp Nou but after a summer when the hints were not exactly subtle and a season in which for the first time in a decade his role was reduced, starting 14 league games, a victim of finance as much as football, he decided the time had come to depart – even without a final destination.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/14/jordi-alba-the-problem-at-barcelona-wasnt-me-spain-italy-premier-league">Continue reading...</a>

## My Friend Anne Frank by Hannah Pick-Goslar review – a survivor’s story

<p>An extraordinary, posthumously published book recalls the horrors of Nazi occupation and the liberation of Bergen-Belsen</p><p>When Nazi officers arrived at the home of 15-year-old Hannah Pick-Goslar, she had her suitcase ready. The Goslars had already narrowly survived one razzia, the name for the systematic roundup of Jews in occupied Amsterdam. After taking the family to a theatre-turned-deportation centre, officials had looked at their papers and, seeing that Pick-Goslar’s father and grandfather were members of the Jewish Council, released them. But this time, on 20 June 1943, there were no such privileges. The Nazis had sealed off their neighbourhood, blocking roads and stationing soldiers on every bridge. Early in the morning, loudspeakers blared in the streets, telling Jewish residents to prepare for departure. Then a member of the green police, the wing of the German army tasked with policing civilians, banged on the Goslars’ door and told them: “You have 20 minutes to pack your things.”</p><p>The title of Pick-Goslar’s memoir, My Friend Anne Frank, is misleading and – however unintentionally – does it a disservice. This is not really the story of Frank, who achieved posthumous fame through the diary she kept while in hiding, even though, as a neighbour and close friend of the author, she is a significant presence in the first third of the book. It is, in fact, the vivid and extraordinary story of Pick-Goslar, a Holocaust survivor who, following her arrest in Amsterdam, was imprisoned first at Westerbork, a Dutch holding camp near the German border, and later at the concentration camp Bergen-Belsen.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/14/my-friend-anne-frank-by-hannah-pick-goslar-review-a-survivors-story">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I had stopped being an active participant in my own life. Now I knew I had to shorten my list of regrets – and I began meeting the world with a resounding ‘yes’</p><p>I was helping my mother prepare for an appointment at the Department of Motor Vehicles in Honolulu when I got the text message. “BALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND TO HAWAII,” the official alert read. “SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.” The islands were already on edge because of tensions between the US and North Korea. Wary and agitated, I tried to make sense of the situation.</p><p>When I look back on that moment in 2018, the most visceral memory I have is how conscious I was of my scalp. Having never thought of it before, I remember feeling acutely aware of its presence, how odd it was that hair has follicles. In these last, precious moments, I asked my mother what, in the face of our impending death, she wanted to do next. She still wanted to go to the DMV. In her mind, we could be sitting ducks – or we could just get on with it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/14/moment-changed-me-missile-alert-death">Continue reading...</a>

Much has been made of the author’s sparse style, which combines poetic and surreal descriptions with lithe plotting and bleakly surreal settings: an appealing combination for a motion picture adaptation.</p><p>The Australian director John Hillcoat brought it to the screen in 2009 with a film that impressively translates the book’s heaving sense of sadness, using an anemic palette to evoke the look of a dying, inconsolable world, memorably navigated by Viggo Mortensen (billed as “the Man”) and Kodi Smit-McPhee (“the Boy”). But The Road is just one of several adaptations of McCarthy’s books, which often possessed a quality that worked for film: 2000’s All the Pretty Horses (directed by Billy Bob Thornton), 2011’s The Sunset Limited (directed by Tommy Lee Jones), 2013’s Child of God (directed by James Franco), and, of course, the Coen brothers’ 2007 neo-western No Country for Old Men.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/14/masterpieces-and-oddities-cormac-mccarthys-bleak-bold-and-batty-films">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As well as footage of destructive blazes tearing through California, this documentary offers careful analysis of how to prevent them</p><p>As the intense Canadian wildfires continue to make headlines, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/07/new-york-air-quality-alerts">engulfing New York City in toxic orange smog</a>, this timely and informative documentary seeks to change the way we think about these increasingly hazardous ecological events. Featuring footage from recent natural disasters, including the historic <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/15/california-camp-fire-missing-death-toll">2018 Camp fire in northern California</a>, the opening places viewers in the heart of the inferno. Bright red flames lick through every inch of the ground, leaving behind a trail of burning wreckage, and waves of smoke turn the morning sky pitch-black.</p><p>The sight is terrifying, almost surreal, yet Elemental also aims to debunk outdated myths about wildfires, regularly regurgitated by mainstream media and even forest management departments. An eclectic cohort of experts, who include academics, fire deputies and environmental volunteers, break down long-held misconceptions in a systematic and easy-to-understand fashion. For instance, for decades, logging new plantations has been a favoured method of fire prevention. In reality, however, maintaining old natural forests proves more effective at slowing down the spread of a wildfire as well as shielding populated areas from firestorms.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/14/elemental-reimagine-wildfire-review-terrifying-extreme-weather-and-how-to-stop-it">Continue reading...</a>

But Union Carbide never answered for the devastating contamination.

The plant, in Madhya Pradesh, India, was equipped with six safety systems designed to detect such a leak, none of which were operational that night. <a href="https://www.bhopal.org/continuing-disaster/the-bhopal-gas-disaster/union-carbides-disaster/">Twenty-seven tons of MIC gas spread throughout the sleeping city</a>.</p><p>As an engineer was flushing water through a corroded pipe in the MIC production complex, a series of valves failed, allowing the water to flow freely into one of the three-storey tanks holding the toxic chemical in a liquid state.

<p>Wacky plots, endlessly irritating characters and a distinct lack of stripping – this Disney+ series isn’t a patch on the film</p><p>You remember the hit film, of course. In 1997, The Full Monty won Baftas, an Oscar and people’s hearts with its uplifting tale of six men, some of them former steelworkers in Sheffield, trying to improve their lot by putting together a striptease act. The title derived from their promise to outdo the Chippendales by revealing everybody’s pie and chips at the end – to the lads’ local audience only, you understand. In 1997 we hadn’t yet fallen quite so far into the pit of depravity in which 2023 happily frolics and we viewers only saw their bums. Which always felt to me like the better deal.</p><p>A new eight-part series of the same title and written, like the original film, by Simon Beaufoy (this time with Alice Nutter) revisits the gang 25 years on – as the opening caption puts it “Seven prime ministers and eight northern regeneration policies later.” The lads are still in Sheffield, an even more post-industrial landscape, and the melancholic undertow of the film – in which it was clear but not dwelled on that the climactic show would be a brief, shining moment, not a transformative one – now tugs far more insistently on all their lives.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/14/the-full-monty-tv-review-boring-and-badly-written">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Gathering in Vilnius is likely to result in post-war security guarantees and easier route to join alliance when the time comes</p><p>Ukraine will not be offered a timeline with specific dates by which it can join Nato at its summit in Vilnius next month but instead may be offered a shorter route when an offer of membership is made. The proposal, reflecting a gathering consensus of key partners in the western defence alliance, will come as a disappointment to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.</p><p>Nato members, but outside formal Nato structures, will also offer post-conflict security guarantees to Ukraine, which are likely to take the shape of broad commitments to protect Ukraine from assaults by Russia. They are also expected to continue to provide ammunition and to help the Ukrainian armed forces become more convergent with Nato. But the commitments are likely to take a broad high level form rather than be specific offers of weaponry.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/14/ukraine-will-not-be-offered-timeline-for-nato-membership-at-summit-in-july">Continue reading...</a>

He was nearly 60 when, in 1992, his sixth novel, All the Pretty Horses, brought him mainstream attention. The book was a bestselling award-winner and it was followed by The Crossing (1994) and Cities of the Plain (1998), to form The Border Trilogy.</p><p>No Country for Old Men (2005) and The Road (2006) sold well and won awards too, the latter landing a Pulitzer. Both became hit films, made by the Coen brothers and John Hillcoat respectively. Then, after a 16-year long silence, McCarthy’s final books arrived in 2022: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/oct/22/the-passenger-by-cormac-mccarthy-exclusive-extract">The Passenger</a> and Stella Maris. The paired novels met with mixed reactions, particularly the austere <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/07/stella-maris-by-cormac-mccarthy-review-a-slow-motion-study-of-obliteration">Stella Maris</a>, a book-length conversation between a suicidal mathematical prodigy and her therapist. Reviewers wondered at McCarthy’s attempt to write a female lead; McCarthy wrote about men, mostly. But in Stella Maris there were flashes of his classic style too, of his mordant wit and stark description.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/14/cormac-mccarthy-showed-us-americas-violent-heart">Continue reading...</a>
