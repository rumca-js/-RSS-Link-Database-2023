There\u2019s no internet, because it\u2019s 1988, so I\u2019m hearing this news on the corner of 12th Street and Broadway at Manhattan\u2019s comic-book mecca of the time, Forbidden Planet.\nBut the thing is, people are pissed. Michael Keaton? Mr. Mom?! How could this guy be Batman?!\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just the fans. The Wall Street Journal ran a front-page story in November of that year questioning the casting of Keaton as Batman. That in turn spurred on even more media speculation about the choices being made on this multi-million dollar movie.\nAnd then there were the petitions and the letter-writing campaigns where fans are said to have pleaded with Warner Bros. to get rid of Keaton and change the course of the DC film \u2013 some reports say there were 50,000 letters written!\n\nThe role of Batman is so huge now, as is Keaton\u2019s part in making the character the big-screen legend that he is, that it\u2019s hard to conceptualize today what a shock his casting was in 1988. But at the time, the actor was mostly known for his comedic roles like Mr. Mom.\n\nOf course, the echos of Tim Burton\u2019s Batman still influence the superhero movie genre to this day, even as Keaton himself returns to the role for The Flash some 31 years after being away. But it\u2019s easy to forget now that when he first donned the cowl and eyeliner, there were a ton of fans who couldn\u2019t handle the notion of Mr. Mom, Beetlejuice, the Clean and Sober guy, and so on playing Batman. And for better or worse, it would be a trend that would continue with pretty much every Batman since, from Christian Bale to Ben Affleck to Robert Pattinson (and even Val Kilmer and George Clooney if you dig deep enough).\n\nSo let\u2019s look back at the inauspicious debut of Michael Keaton\u2019s Batman, and how his Dark Knight would go on to soar all the same, paving the way for the big-screen dominance of the character ever since.\n\n#IGN #Movies #Batman", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scFUG6Bk5fw", "date_published": "2023-06-14 13:15:08+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Devil May Cry Director Talks Creating Iconic Characters, Multiplayer, and Going Mobile", "description": "Devil May Cry series director, Hideaki Itsuno joins us to talk all things Devil May Cry.
