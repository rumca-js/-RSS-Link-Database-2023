Political Shakedown For Millions: NYC Mayor Eric Adams Exports Migrant Crisis to Suburbs 

MAMARONECK— Project Veritas today revealed that the mayor of New York City, Eric Adams, is spending millions in tax dollars to put illegal migrants into hotels in Rockland County, New York.

“They’re trying to turn it into a homeless shelter, like a migrant facility, and under zoning laws you can’t turn it into anything other than a hotel,” said Martin Uli, Assistant County Attorney for Rockland County. 

An investigation by Project Veritas exposed the inner workings of a multi-million-dollar deal between the office of New York City Mayor Eric Adams and Hudson Valley hotel owner Ashok Bhatt, to house a large number of migrants in the 171 room Armoni Inn & Suites in Orangeburg, NY. Project Veritas captured these admissions by Martin Uli on video, utilizing undercover journalism.

The lease document obtained by Project Veritas reveals a proposed deal between Rapid Reliable Testing NY, LLC (“DocGo”) and Palisades EOM LLC for $6,241,500 per year for five years to rent the rooms totaling $31,207,500.

NYC uses DocGo to contract with hotels. DocGo has been the subject of Project Veritas in 2022 reporting which investigated their role in administering the COVID-19 vaccine to children in New York City.

Uli admits on camera that if the money had been better spread around, there would have been less resistance to the Mayor’s scheme, “...if Rockland was getting a piece of the pie, they would not have sent the health inspectors to that hotel.”

•   MARTIN ULI, ASSISTANT COURT ATTORNEY, HONORABLE THOMAS P. ZUGIBE, ROCKLAND CO COURTHOUSE, ROCKLAND, NY:
“Basically, the county of Rockland is just trying to keep them shut down because they don’t want them to operate.  So, the hotel is saying that, ‘There’s really no reason because it’s illegal for us to operate as anything other than a hotel,’ and they’re [Rockland County] just like, finding health violations.  Loose nails.  Stuff like that.”

•  MARTIN ULI:
“The illegal part is they can’t operate, like under zoning restrictions.  They can’t be anything else other than a hotel.”

•  MARTIN ULI:
“Yeah.  Yeah, because they’re trying to turn it into a homeless shelter, like a migrant facility, and under zoning laws you can’t turn it into anything other than a hotel.”

•  PROJECT VERITAS JOURNALIST:
“Okay, and who’s making the case to turn it into that?”

•  MARTIN ULI:
“New York City.  Mayor Adams.”

•  PATRICK FRENCH, HEAD OF MAINTENANCE, ARMONI INN & SUITES, ORANGEBURG, NY:
“I don’t know why Ashok took that deal, man.  He should never take that deal.  He’s just watching the money.”
