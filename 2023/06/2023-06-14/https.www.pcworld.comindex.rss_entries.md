<p>&ldquo;Engineered obsolescence&rdquo; is an accusation that gets thrown at tech hardware a lot. And it&rsquo;s often misapplied: Lithium-ion batteries really do wear down, especially when constantly recharged, and old software can&rsquo;t keep running new applications forever. But in the case of some Western Digital hard drives, which appear to be sending out &ldquo;replace me!&rdquo; warnings after an arbitrary time limit even in the absence of any actual hardware faults, it might be entirely justified. </p>



<p>Such is the case with WD drives installed in some Synology network attached storage (NAS) devices, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/clearly-predatory-western-digital-sparks-panic-anger-for-age-shaming-hdds/&amp;xcust=2-1-1953639-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">according to a report from Ars Technica</a>. After running continuously for three years &mdash; which is fairly unremarkable for hard drives designed specifically for server storage &mdash; the analytics software pre-loaded in the Western Digital drives alert Synology&rsquo;s DiskStation Manager interface. Alerts it to what? That the drive has been running for three years, and that&rsquo;s all. The recommended action is to replace the drive&hellip;and it&rsquo;s surely coincidental that this happens shortly after the three calendar years of some drives&rsquo; standard manufacturer warranty. </p>



<p>While the warnings can occur in absence of any other, genuine problems with a hard drive, they&rsquo;re causing headaches for Synology users. Banked drives in a NAS with an active alert can&rsquo;t be used to repair or expand a pool of storage from another source. So users either have to replace the drive in question &mdash; which, again, may have no error or malfunction aside from the fact that its active hours count has ticked over that three years mark &mdash; or disable the drive&rsquo;s analytic system, possibly missing out on genuine alerts in the future. </p>



<p>And &ldquo;ticked&rdquo; is an accurate way to describe the reaction of Synology users all over the internet. On Reddit subs, support pages, and YouTube channels, NAS users are pouring out bowls of wrath on Western Digital and the affected product lines: WD Red Plus, Red Pro, and Purple hard drives. The general accusation is that the WD Device Analytics software (WDDA) is throwing up bogus warnings, trying to get customers to buy new replacements for perfectly functional hard drives. </p>



<p>Synology is caught in the middle for designing software that works with Western Digital&rsquo;s warning system, in the possibly misplaced faith that it would only report genuine hardware errors. The NAS manufacturer is <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://kb.synology.com/en-in/DSM/tutorial/Which_Synology_NAS_supports_WDDA&amp;xcust=2-1-1953639-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">encouraging affected users</a> to disable the WDDA system in Storage Manager to clear the warning and restore full repair and expansion functionality. </p>



<p>The kerfuffle is the latest in a series of controversies that find users accusing manufacturers of trying to artificially shorten the life of their products in hopes of selling more replacements. Printer ink cartridges often send an &ldquo;empty&rdquo; signal long before their reservoirs have fully run dry (a situation not helped by arbitrary DRM <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1656073/these-hp-printers-can-be-upgraded-to-allow-third-party-printer-ink.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">forcing you to buy manufacturer brands</a>), and even Apple has been accused of <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/672941/iphone-battery-replacement-cost-and-deadline.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">slowing down older iPhones</a> in order to juice sales. Google-powered Chromebooks have <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1793248/chromebooks-dont-last-long-enough-report-claims.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">arbitrary time limits</a> on their security updates, and Microsoft seems to be doing everything in its power to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/614907/windows-11s-update-schedule-blurs-as-microsoft-promises-continuous-innovation.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">push users onto Windows 11</a>. How much of this is truly malicious and how much is business as usual &mdash; and whether there&rsquo;s actually a distinction between those two &mdash; is a matter for continual debate. </p>

<p><em>Katamari Damacy </em>might just be the poster child of quirky Japanese games, at least for players who aren&rsquo;t old enough to remember <em>Slap-Happy Rythm Busters. </em>It&rsquo;s a game about rolling a giant ball around a 3D environment, sticking more and more stuff to it until it swallows the entire world, in a simple and addictive gameplay loop that also doubles as a potent metaphor for late-stage capital consolidation. And if you&rsquo;ve never had a chance to play it before, you can try it on your Google search results now. </p>



<p>Some Google engineers decided to add a playable Katamari minigame to the service&rsquo;s ever-growing list of Easter eggs in search results. Here&rsquo;s how you play: <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.google.com/search?q=katamari&amp;xcust=2-2-1953333-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Just Google &ldquo;Katamari,&rdquo;</a> then look for the bouncing ball on the right side of the screen. Click or tap it, and you can roll the ball around the web page with your finger (on mobile) or arrow keys (on desktop). Words, images, and even page components like the Google logo will stick to the ball and to other rolled-up elements. Rinse, repeat, enjoy. </p>

<p>Windows 10 is still the most popular operating system, remaining well ahead of the Windows 11 in <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide&amp;xcust=2-2-1953498-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Statcounter</a>&lsquo;s usage statistics. But since <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1477078/microsoft-will-stop-selling-windows-10-licenses-in-a-few-days.html">Microsoft no longer sells Windows 10</a>, some PC users turn to illegal downloads and torrents instead. Hackers are now exploiting Windows 10&rsquo;s popularity for a new attack.</p>



<p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/pirated-windows-10-isos-install-clipper-malware-via-efi-partitions/&amp;xcust=2-2-1953498-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Bleeping Computer</a> warns that Windows 10 ISO files are being offered for free download on various torrents/file-sharing platforms, but those files are contaminated with malware such as <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://news.drweb.com/show/?i=14712&amp;lng=en&amp;xcust=2-2-1953498-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Trojan.Clipper.231</a>. This malware is a dangerous variant of a <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/what-is-cryptojacking" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">&ldquo;cryptocurrency hijacker</a>.&rdquo; Malware like this hides within computers, tablets, smartphones and even servers, then secretly carries out crypto-mining for the hacker&rsquo;s benefit. </p>



<p>Unlike other malware, most cryptocurrency hijackers do not directly harm you or your computer: they do not delete any data, do not encrypt anything, and do not steal anything. But they do steal computing power for mining, thus also causing higher power consumption. </p>



<p>That&rsquo;s already bad. <em>This </em>cryptocurrency hijacker malware, however, is even worse.</p>



<h2 id="actually-hijacking-your-cryptocurrency">Actually hijacking your cryptocurrency</h2>



<p>According to Bleeping Computer, this malware hides your PC BIOS&rsquo;s small EFI partition, which contains the boot loader for your operating system. Lurking in this partition, outside the actual operating system, the malware tries to escape virus scanners.</p>



<p>The malware can cause considerable damage on infected computers because unlike &ldquo;normal&rdquo; cryptocurrency hijackers, it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;crypto stealer&rdquo; that tries to sniff out cryptocurrency wallet addresses from your clipboard. If it finds crypto wallet addresses, it replaces them with hostile addresses that are under the control of the attacker. This allows the hackers to redirect your cryptocurrency to their accounts, which, according to Dr. Web, has already earned them at least $19,000 USD worth of Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>



<p>It goes without saying, but we&rsquo;ll say it again: Be sure to buy Windows 10 from secure sources and do not download pirated copies of Windows 10. Our explainer on <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/397575/how-to-get-windows-cheap-or-even-for-free.html">how to get Windows for cheap (or even free)</a> can point you in the right direction and keep you far away from malware lurking in sketchy ISOs.</p>

## PCIe 7.0 is coming sooner than you think, and ludicrously fast

<p>Most home PC builders <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1676119/pcie-5-ssd-5-reasons-upgrade.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">just got their hands on PCI Express 5.0 hardware</a>, or are still waiting on it to make sense in terms of either price or compatibility. But progress, or something that looks like it if you squint hard enough, marches on. The Peripheral Component Interconnect Special Interest Group, or PCI-SIG if you&rsquo;re in a hurry, just published version 0.3 of its PCIe 7.0 spec upgrade. </p>



<p>It&rsquo;s in testing right now and scheduled to be finalized sometime in 2025. It should theoretically hit at least some PCs and peripherals shortly after, though wider adoption tends to takes months (if not years).</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="PCIe 7.0" class="wp-image-1953426" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/pcie-7.0.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCI-SIG</p></div>



<p>What&rsquo;s better about PCIe 7.0? According to the press release <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.techpowerup.com/310045/pcie-7-0-specification-version-0-3-available-to-pci-sig-members&amp;xcust=2-1-1953221-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">re-published by TechPowerUp</a>, the more advanced tech will enable data transfers at up to 512GB/s in both directions on a full x16 connection. That&rsquo;s four times faster than today&rsquo;s PCIe 5.0 connections, continuing PCIe&rsquo;s trend of doubling speeds every generation. Other improvements include PAM4 support for improved electronic signaling, and better latency and power efficiency. Like previous PCIe releases, 7.0 will remain backwards-compatible. </p>



<p>But wait, what about PCIe 6.0? Technically, that&rsquo;s been available to hardware makers since last year. PCIe 5.0 has been around since 2019. So while version 7.0 might be on track to be finalized in two years, it&rsquo;ll probably be another two (at least) before there&rsquo;s any kind of push to actually implement the improvement in consumer hardware. Which is all well and good &mdash; it&rsquo;ll give me time to save up for a $5000 RTX 7090. </p>

<p>The Anker 568 USB-C Docking Station is slightly unusual in that it&rsquo;s one of the few docking stations marketed as a USB4 docking station, rather than a &ldquo;true&rdquo; Thunderbolt dock. Don&rsquo;t let that dissuade you, however, as Anker&rsquo;s well-designed dock works just fine with Thunderbolt ports, and offers a few nifty features to boot.</p>



<p>This 11-in-1 docking station favors DisplayPort, with two DisplayPort 1.4 ports, and a single HDMI 2.0 video port. The Anker 568&rsquo;s distinguishing feature, however, is the pair of 10Gbps USB-C ports on the front, with each supplying 30W of power as well as a separate 100W connection to the laptop. That&rsquo;s quite unusual, and the two ports should fast-charge a smartphone and possibly even a tablet. </p>



<p>(Most modern monitors have both DisplayPort and HDMI ports. If you own two HDMI-only displays, you&rsquo;ll have to spend an additional $20 or so on a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Basics-DisplayPort-Display-Cable/dp/B08FBGNR8C/&amp;xcust=2-1-1922334-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">DisplayPort to HDMI adapter cable</a>.)</p>



<p>USB4 is generally considered to be the industry-standard version of Thunderbolt, and is often associated with AMD Ryzen notebooks because of licensing issues. USB4 and Thunderbolt, however, are essentially the same thing. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394176/the-first-usb4-products-are-here-what-to-know-what-to-buy.html">USB4 products debuted in 2021</a>, and Microsoft is building in a dedicated <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1858854/new-windows-test-build-signals-key-changes-are-coming-for-your-pc.html">USB4 settings page as part of an upcoming update</a> for Windows 11. (For more on this, plus any differences between Thunderbolt 3, Thunderbolt 4, and USB4, consult our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393714/best-thunderbolt-docks-for-a-laptop-pc.html#:~:text=What%E2%80%99s%20the%20difference%20between%20Thunderbolt%203%2C%20Thunderbolt%204%2C%20and%20USB4">roundup of the best Thunderbolt docks</a>, specifically the section that&rsquo;s linked.) We also tested the dock on an Intel-based laptop with Thunderbolt ports, and it worked well.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Anker 568 USB-C USB4 docking station" class="wp-image-1922356" height="713" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Anker-568-front.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The front of the Anker 568 USB-C Docking Station features two USB-C charging / data ports that can put out almost 30W of charging power.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<h2 id="anker-568-usb-c-docking-station-features-and-design">Anker 568 USB-C Docking Station features and design</h2>



<p>In general, the Anker 568 USB-C Docking Station is well designed, with a lengthy 38.5-inch USB4 cable snaking out one side of the black plastic dock, and a Kensington lock on the other. The Anker 568&rsquo;s front sports the pair of USB-C charging ports, along with a small white power LED as well as a power button for manually turning the dock on and off. </p>



<p>On the back, there are two 5Gbps USB 2.0 ports (marked with a small keyboard and mouse icon) as well as two 10Gbps USB 3.0 ports for external hard drives and USB keys. Anker also includes a standard gigabit ethernet port, the power connection, and the two DisplayPort and HDMI connections.</p>



<p>Anker&rsquo;s dock looks forward to a day when 8K displays are ubiquitous, as either of the DisplayPort connections supports 8K resolutions at 30Hz. You&rsquo;re probably considering this dock for a 4K display, however, and you can connect two 4K displays at a more comfortable 60Hz resolution to any two of the dock&rsquo;s video ports. You can even connect a 4K display to each of the three ports, though only 30Hz refresh rates are available under that scenario.</p>



<p>Anker asks you to download a dock manager application that automatically updates it with the latest firmware. A USB4 product should work out of the box, however, and our review unit generally did. We detected a bit of flicker in one area of one of our 4K test monitors, however, and that display briefly lost connection a few times over the course of two days. We also noticed that Windows gave us the occasional &ldquo;ping&rdquo; indicating that a device had detached from the PC, without it being immediately obvious which device it was. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>The Anker 568&rsquo;s distinguishing feature is a pair of 10Gbps USB-C ports on the front, each supplying 30W of power for charging smartphones or even tablets.</p></blockquote></figure>

<p>Our charging tests revealed that the Anker 568 pushes about 26.5W via the front 30W charging ports, fast-charging our test smartphones. Our USB-C power meter recorded a high of 86W consumed by the laptop and transferred via Anker&rsquo;s dock.</p>



<p>The dock&rsquo;s streaming performance across the ethernet port to the external displays was a bit jittery before a reboot cleared up the issue. Playing back 4K video across the dock&rsquo;s ports and transferring data were normal. The plasticky exterior of the dock was warm to the touch, but not overly so.</p>



<h2 id="is-the-anker-568-usb-c-docking-station-worth-it">Is the Anker 568 USB-C Docking Station worth it?</h2>



<p>Anker&rsquo;s price puts it somewhere in the middle of our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393714/best-thunderbolt-docks-for-a-laptop-pc.html">best Thunderbolt docks</a>, and, in general, its feature set doesn&rsquo;t set it apart. The one exception, though, are its two powerful front-mounted charging ports, which is a compelling selling point if you frequently charge a phone, laptop, and tablet. Anker has made a solid docking station, suitable for either your laptop&rsquo;s Thunderbolt or USB4 ports.</p>

<p>Nvidia&rsquo;s hotly anticipated GeForce RTX 4060 will hit the streets earlier than expected. Originally scheduled to launch in July, the $299 graphics card&mdash;the first mainstream GPU in Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX 40-series lineup&mdash;will now release on June 29.</p>



<p>Nvidia quietly updated its <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/rtx-4060-4060ti/&amp;xcust=2-1-1953339-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">RTX 4060 Family webpage</a> to list the new release date, as spotted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-8-gb-graphics-card-confirmed-launch-29th-june-299-usd/&amp;xcust=2-1-1953339-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">WccfTech</a> and shown in the screenshot above. (The 16GB version of the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1921195/nvidia-unveils-3-geforce-rtx-4060-ti-gpus-dlss-3-goes-mainstream.html">announced at the same time as the 4060</a>, remains slated for July.)</p>



<p>There&rsquo;s a lot riding on the RTX 4060&rsquo;s shoulders. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/416006/the-best-graphics-cards-for-pc-gaming.html">Desktop graphics cards</a> are suffering their <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1947496/oof-desktop-gpu-sales-are-down-almost-40-percent-year-to-year.html">worst sales slump in decades</a>, exacerbated by Nvidia&rsquo;s $400 <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1925928/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-ti-8gb-review.html">RTX 4060 Ti</a>, $600 <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1781139/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-review.html">RTX 4070</a>, $800 <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444726/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-review.html">RTX 4070 Ti</a>, and $1200 <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1379747/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-tested-5-things.html">RTX 4080</a> offering either exorbitant pricing, stagnant performance upgrades, or both. With GPU sales struggling, AMD skipped over the usual 1440p high-end cards for its rival Radeon RX 7000-series, jumping from the flagship 7900 XT family all the way down to the $269 Radeon RX 7600, which launched last month.</p>

<p>We called the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1928214/amd-radeon-rx-7600-review.html">Radeon RX 7600 a good, affordable graphics card</a>&mdash;the first of its kind to launch in damned near five years thanks to pandemic, crypto, and supply chain woes. Meanwhile, we called Nvidia&rsquo;s GeForce RTX 4060 Ti &ldquo;a disappointment for $400,&rdquo; and we were one of the <em>nicer </em>reviews around.</p>



<p>The RTX 4060, wielding <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1662185/what-is-dlss-3-nvidia-geforce-rtx-ai-feature-explained.html">Nvidia&rsquo;s new DLSS 3 technology</a> and awesome software features, could be a hero at $300. The cut-down memory system that cripples the RTX 4060 Ti is a much more acceptable compromise at the $300 price point (the Radeon RX 7600 uses a similar configuration). But it&rsquo;ll all depend on performance.</p>



<p>The 4060 Ti did not move the performance needle whatsoever compared to the last-gen 3060 Ti <em>unless</em> you&rsquo;re using DLSS 3, which is only available in select games. If the $299 GeForce RTX 4060 exhibits similar stagnation, it could be a hard sell. But if it offers a value upgrade like the Radeon RX 7600 does&mdash;AMD&rsquo;s GPU delivers 35 percent performance uplift over the last-gen Radeon RX 6600, for an 18 percent lower MSRP&mdash;<em>and </em>DLSS 3, it could be a superstar.</p>



<p>All that&rsquo;s left to do is wait for independent performance reviews. Now you&rsquo;ll be getting those&mdash;and the RTX 4060 itself&mdash;a bit earlier than expected.</p>

## How to find power-hogging software with Windows Task Manager
 - [https://www.pcworld.com/article/394186/find-power-hog-laptop-software-windows-task-manager.html](https://www.pcworld.com/article/394186/find-power-hog-laptop-software-windows-task-manager.html)

<p>Closing every possible program can help you eke out more endurance when your laptop is running low on battery. But not every program fully closes when you exit its window, and sometimes background processes can suck up a surprising amount of computing power. </p>



<p>Fortunately, the Task Manager in Windows 10 and 11 includes tools that let you quickly identify the power hogs on your computer, though the information isn&rsquo;t straightforward to locate. You can use its insights and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394191/3-ways-extend-laptop-battery-last-longer.html">these three crucial Windows settings tweaks</a> to conserve energy when power&rsquo;s running low, to ensure your laptop lasts long enough to reach an outlet. (If you&rsquo;re constantly struggling with notebook endurance, it might be time to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/436674/the-best-pc-laptops-of-the-year.html">consider a new laptop</a>.)</p>



<p>Start by pressing <strong>Ctrl </strong>+<strong> Shift </strong>+<strong> Esc</strong> to summon the Windows Task Manager. By default, it will open to a tab showing all the processes running on your system.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/03/task-manager-power-usage-default-100879512-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="task manager power usage default" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/03/task-manager-power-usage-default-100879512-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption>
<p>Task Manager&rsquo;s default view. (Your processes and programs will vary.)</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p>The information you need to sniff out power hogs is right here, but you probably can&rsquo;t see it yet. Task Manager opens in a minimized window rather than full screen, and as you can see above, the layout of the Processes tab make it looks like that &ldquo;GPU engine&rdquo; listing is the end of the information. It&rsquo;s not, though&mdash;notice the scroll bar at the bottom of the window?</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/03/task-manager-power-usage-100879511-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="task manager power usage" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/03/task-manager-power-usage-100879511-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption>
<p>The expanded view shows the power tracking options. What are you doing, Chrome?!</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p>If you scroll to the right&mdash;or better yet, resize your window to show a wider horizontal view with all columns in view&mdash;you&rsquo;ll find &ldquo;Power usage&rdquo; and &ldquo;Power usage trend&rdquo; columns at the end of the row for each process. The &ldquo;power usage&rdquo; information details how much energy the process is using currently, while the &ldquo;power usage trend&rdquo; column shows power usage over the last two minutes. Clicking the name of each column sorts all the processes from worst to best, or vice-versa if you click it again, so you can find troublesome programs lickety-split.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/03/tm-power-select-100879516-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="tm power select" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/03/tm-power-select-100879516-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a></figure></div>




<p>If you don&rsquo;t see those columns for whatever reason, right-click any column in the Task Manager&rsquo;s process tab and make sure &ldquo;power usage&rdquo; and &ldquo;power usage trend&rdquo; are selected in the menu that appears, as shown above.</p>



<p>Simply right-click a process and select <em>End Task</em> if it&rsquo;s sucking down power.</p>



<p>Note that accidentally shutting down a critical system process can require you to restart your computer, and this isn&rsquo;t a method you&rsquo;ll want to perform regularly aside from spot checks for power-hungry rogue software. But if your laptop is on its last legs and you&rsquo;re trying to squeeze every last ounce of juice from it, this Task Manager trick can help out.</p>



<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to turn down your screen brightness too! You&rsquo;ll find it in Windows 10 and 11&rsquo;s display settings options. It&rsquo;s one of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394191/3-ways-extend-laptop-battery-last-longer.html">3 crucial tweaks that can help your laptop battery last longer</a> when you&rsquo;re running low on juice.</p>

<p>If you have to work in Microsoft Outlook, you might at well do it smart. Here are several tips to help you work more efficiently in all available versions of Outlook. All of our tips were tested using Outlook 2021, but some tips also work in a similar form with Outlook 2019 and 2016.</p>



<p><em>This article was translated from German to English, and originally appeared on pcwelt.de.</em> <em>The screenshots below remain in German.</em></p>



<h2 class="toc" id="tip-1-backup-and-restore-profile-settings-signatures-and-email-accounts">Tip 1: Backup and restore profile settings, signatures, and email accounts</h2>



<p>Outlook 2016/2019 and Outlook 2021 save their profile settings&mdash;including email accounts, favorite folders, settings, and information about the required servers&mdash;in the Windows registry. If you export the corresponding keys, you can transfer a large part of Outlook&rsquo;s settings to a new computer or restore them in the case of new installations.</p>



<p>To restore, you only need to double-click on the exported registry file and all email settings will be integrated into Windows again. The steps are as follows:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Open the registry editor with <em>regedit</em>.</li><li>Navigate to <em>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SoftwareMicrosoft\Office16.0\Outlook\Profiles</em></li><li>You will see each profile as a separate key below the <em>Profiles</em> key. Right-click on the profile you want to export and select <em>Export</em> from the context menu. There&rsquo;s your backup!</li></ol>



<p>To restore your backup, double-click on the exported registry file and have it imported into Windows.</p>



<p>Want to back up your Outlook signatures too? Outlook saves signatures in the directory &rdquo; C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Signatures&rdquo;. You can also easily save these by copying them and restoring them at any time.</p>



<h2 class="toc" id="tip-2-address-people-directly-in-emails">Tip 2: Address people directly in emails</h2>



<p>If you send an email to several recipients, you can address the individual recipients directly within the email text using the @ sign. If you press the @ sign in the text, you can select a person from the address book and write text to that specific person. This person is then automatically entered as a recipient of the email if he or she is not already one.</p>



<h2 class="toc" id="tip-3-move-appointments-across-months-and-weeks-in-the-calendar-view-using-drag-drop">Tip 3: Move appointments across months and weeks in the calendar view using drag &amp; drop</h2>



<p>If you click and hold an appointment in Outlook&rsquo;s calendar, you can drag it from the current view to the calendar on the left and release it. Outlook moves the appointment to then and shows the new day on the right side of the calendar view. This allows you to fine-tune appointment details. This is useful for quickly moving an appointment over several months or weeks, but also for shuffling an appointment between days in the same week.</p>



<h2 class="toc" id="tip-4-change-the-subject-lines-of-emails-for-more-effective-searching">Tip 4: Change the subject lines of emails for more effective searching</h2>



<p>In the reading area of Outlook as well as the window of an open email, the subject is visible at the very top. If you click in the subject area, you can edit it. This has several advantages. For example, you can adjust the subject directly in the mail window when replying or forwarding, or integrate important information such as customer numbers or order numbers. Since Outlook also indexes this area, you can find e-mails with effective subject lines more easily via search.</p>



<h2 class="toc" id="tip-5-use-text-modules-in-outlook">Tip 5: Use text modules in Outlook</h2>



<p>If you use certain text passages frequently, you can save them as text modules in Outlook. To do this, select the text in an email and choose &ldquo;<em>Insert -&gt; Quick parts -&gt; Save selection in quick parts catalog</em>&rdquo; in the editor window. This allows you to easily recall the text at any time. (If &ldquo;Quick parts&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t appear, you&rsquo;ll find the command on the far right of the toolbar by the &hellip; ellipsis.)</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage center"><figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img alt="Hinzuf&uuml;gen von neuen Textbausteinen in Outlook f&uuml;r schnellere E-Mails." class="wp-image-1780761" height="575" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/outlook-textbausteine.png" width="709" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thomas Joos</p></div>



<p>Inserting text modules into e-mails is done via the same menu by clicking on the saved text module or by writing the name of the text module in the e-mail. Outlook then recognizes the saved text modules and you can insert them quickly and easily.</p>



<h2 id="tip-6-automate-your-inbox-with-quicksteps">Tip 6: Automate your inbox with Quicksteps</h2>



<p>Outlook&rsquo;s &ldquo;Quicksteps&rdquo; lets you assign several actions to emails to sort them, such as categorizing an e-mail, marking it as read, and moving it to a specific folder. Better yet, all this can be done with a mouse click once you&rsquo;ve set up Quicksteps.</p>



<p>If you open an email and right-click within it to open the context menu, you&rsquo;ll find &ldquo;<em>Quicksteps -&gt; Manage Quicksteps</em>&ldquo;. That&rsquo;s where the magic lies. Select &ldquo;<em>New</em>&rdquo; to create a new Quickstep, then select &ldquo;<em>Edit</em>&rdquo; and enter a name at the top of the window to save it for quick and easy future use in the Quicksteps menu. The &ldquo;<em>Add action</em>&rdquo; option lets you fine-tune the exact steps to be performed when you select this Quickstep in an email, such as assigning it a category or moving it to a specific folder. You can delete Quicksteps by clicking on the trash icon.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage center"><figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img alt="Quicksteps erleichtern die Verwaltung von E-Mails enorm" class="wp-image-1780763" height="787" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/outlook-quicksteps.png" width="673" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thomas Joos</p></div>



<h2 class="toc" id="tip-7-create-contacts-more-quickly-from-e-mails">Tip 7: Create contacts more quickly from e-mails</h2>



<p>If you drag an e-mail onto the contacts icon at the bottom left while holding down the right mouse button, you can create contacts from e-mails. Outlook reads out relevant contact information and fills in the corresponding fields automatically. You can, of course, edit the fields later if needed. To help with future contact info editing, Outlook displays the content of the email as text within the contact. Any information you don&rsquo;t need, you can simply delete. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage center"><figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img alt="Per Drag &amp; Drop erstellen Sie aus E-Mails sehr schnell Kontakte in Outlook." class="wp-image-1780764" height="227" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/outlook-kontakte-erstellen.png" width="505" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thomas Joos</p></div>

<p>When it comes to keyboards, enthusiasts can get <em>real</em> particular about the way in which it feels and sounds. Me? The more it click-clacks like a typewriter, the better. </p>



<p>Gamers may prefer a keyboard with mechanical switches, as they provide better tactile feedback by springing back when you press down on them. Mechanical keyboards are both durable and customizable, too. But mechanical keyboards simply wouldn&rsquo;t exist without mechanical switches, which are the mechanisms under the keycaps that directly impact feel and precision. </p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re looking to customize your gaming keyboard with new switches, or wondering what sort of switches you&rsquo;d want on a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406235/best-gaming-keyboard.html">new gaming keyboard</a>, we&rsquo;re here to help you through that process. From the three major switch types to how these mechanisms actually work, we&rsquo;ll cover just about everything.  </p>

<p>Simply put, mechanical switches are the mechanisms that live underneath the keycaps on a mechanical keyboard. These switches impact everything from feel to sound and make for a more precise typing experience. Membrane keyboards, on the other hand, have rubber domes underneath the keycaps, so the typing experience feel rather mushy as a result. You won&rsquo;t feel any tactile feedback or hear a satisfying click when you push the key down. </p>



<p>The switch beneath the keycap consists of a spring, prong, and stem. As you can see in the gif above, when the key is pressed down, the prong moves out of the way. When you release the key, the spring snaps back up and the prong returns to its resting position. This whole mechanism is responsible for providing tactile feedback and a loud clicking nose.</p>

<p>When it comes to mechanical switches, there are three different types. As with most things that exist in the universe, each switch type has its pros and cons. But it really boils down to what kind of typing experience you&rsquo;re looking for. </p>



<p>Are you interested in more precision when it comes to first-person-shooter games? You may want to consider linear switches then, as they allow for faster actuation. Want your keyboard to sound more like an old-fashioned typewriter? Clicky switches are a cacophony of sound. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus keyboard" class="wp-image-554545" height="674" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/asus-keyboard.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>Here&rsquo;s an easy-to-follow breakdown of the different switch types:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Linear switches</strong>: If you&rsquo;re looking for a quiet typing experience, linear switches are your best bet. They&rsquo;re pretty straightforward in terms of how they operate. Basically, they just go up and down. Unlike tactile switches, which offer feedback, you won&rsquo;t feel a bump before the key reaches the bottom of the keyboard. They&rsquo;re completely noiseless, too. That said, if you&rsquo;re heavy-handed, you may hurt your fingers. Linear switches offer such a smooth and consistent typing experience, so it&rsquo;s easy to bottom out when pressing on them. These types of switches really take some getting used to.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Tactile switches</strong>: If you want to know if your keystrokes are being logged, tactile switches are a very good option. When a tactile switch depresses, you&rsquo;ll feel a bump at the midway point. This lines up with the moment the key actuates, which is when the key sends a command to the computer&rsquo;s brain.  If you&rsquo;re a relatively fast typist, the infamous &ldquo;bump&rdquo; serves as a good indicator of actuation. They&rsquo;re also quieter than clicky switches and they&rsquo;re pretty durable. </li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Clicky switches</strong>: These switches are just plain fun. They produce a loud audible click and tactile feedback (much like tactile switches). They&rsquo;re a good option for writers (hey girl). That said, they might not be the best choice for gamers. They&rsquo;re pretty darn loud, which might be distracting if you&rsquo;re talking to your teammates over Discord. The same goes for an office setting or environment. You don&rsquo;t want to ignite the ire of your fellow coworkers.</li></ul>



<p>When it comes to mechanical switches, most enthusiasts refer to different &ldquo;Cherry MX&rdquo; colors from that company&rsquo;s popular lineup. There&rsquo;s a lot of variety out there, but for the four main types, you&rsquo;ll find the tactile and clicky Blues, the tactile but quieter Browns (and their stiffer Clear cousins), the heavy linear Blacks, and the light linear Reds. Many keyboard companies offer alternative switches, some based on the sound and feel of more popular Cherry offerings. Razer&rsquo;s Green switches are a decent stand-in for Cherry Blues, for example.</p>

<p>Depends! Do you prefer a quieter typing experience or a grand symphony of clickity-clacks? Personally, as someone who writes and edits for a living, I enjoy a louder typing experience. If the sound of clicking makes your ears bleed, you&rsquo;ll want to spring for linear switches, which produce little to no sound. Many gamers prefer linear switches because they allow for faster typing and more precise keystrokes. In other words, they require less force to press on your end. This is important for competitive shooters, where every second counts. The idea is to minimize as many accidental keystrokes as possible.</p>



<p>If you want to make sure your keystrokes are actually actuating (say that five times fast), tactile or clicky switches are best suited for that. Not only are they loud, but they also offer tactile feedback. While these types of switches are great fun to use, they may not be the best option for a work environment or gaming purposes. Honestly? They&rsquo;re just very loud. They could easily be a distraction in an office setting or if you&rsquo;re trying to chat with your gaming buddies.  </p>
