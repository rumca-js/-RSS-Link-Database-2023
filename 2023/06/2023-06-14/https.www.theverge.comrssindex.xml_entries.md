The measure, quietly implemented in mid-2022, was made at the request of neighbors and the office of city supervisor Rafael Mandelman. It’s an attempt to keep city dwellers who are currently unhoused away from the area by locking down access to one of the library’s most valuable public services. </p>

  <p id="72M5eN">In a filing with the SEC on Wednesday, Sonos shared news that it’s laying off 7 percent of its staff. The company is “also committed to further reducing its real estate footprint and re-evaluating certain program spend,” Sonos said <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001314727/9c116897-cd64-4535-92f9-501e40b6ce83.pdf">in the 8-K filing</a>. The company reported having 1,844 employees <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001314727/32798bf8-a290-46aa-81b2-c12175aae8ee.pdf">as of last October</a>. It’s reasonable to assume Sonos has hired more people since then, but that total indicates the cuts would affect at least 130 roles.</p>
<p id="J5smVY">“We have acknowledged that if we started to deviate from our performance expectations, we would take action to adapt and protect profitability while still investing in our exciting product roadmap to drive future growth,” Sonos CEO Patrick Spence said in a statement. “In the face of continued...</p>

  <p id="d5hDvR">Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a bill Tuesday banning kids under 18 from joining a wide variety of social media sites without parental consent. </p>
<p id="6eodns">The bill, <a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/Text.aspx?LegSess=88R&amp;Bill=HB18">HB 18</a>, requires social media companies to receive explicit consent from a minor’s parent or guardian before they’d be allowed to create their own accounts starting in September of next year. It also forces these companies to prevent children from seeing “harmful” content — like content related to eating disorders, substance abuse, or “grooming” — by creating new filtering systems.</p>

  <p id="NqyehE">There’s been much speculation about which chips will power the next Razer Blade 14, one of very few premium options in the portable 14-inch gaming space. This morning, those chips were finally revealed. The processor will be AMD’s Ryzen 9 7940HS with eight cores, 16 threads, 24MB cache, and 35-54W TDP. The GPUs will be Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 4060 and RTX 4070. </p>
<p id="7cDcom">Pricing is... well, it’s high. The RTX 4060 model will be $2,399, while the base RTX 4070 model will be $2,699.99. Both will have 16GB of DDR5 RAM. There will also be a fancy mercury (white) model for $2,799.99, which will include 32GB of DDR5 RAM as well as the 4070. All three of the models mentioned will have 1TB of PCIe Gen 4 storage. </p>

  <p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="eEcoaH">During Amazon’s Prime Day sale four years ago, I found myself staring at a listing for an Echo Dot smart speaker. It was on sale for half price. I wasn’t browsing with any particular smart home gadgets in mind. It was simply being advertised on the homepage of the e-commerce giant’s website, and I lack the impulse control to resist a good bargain. I purchased it thinking I’d just use it as a fancy voice-controlled radio for my kitchen — much like my parents’ second-gen Echo back home — and told myself that it was the last time I’d line Jeff Bezos’ wallet with my hard-earned cash.</p>

  <p id="6uwrFK">A federal court has issued a temporary restraining order that will prevent Microsoft from closing its $68.7 billion deal to acquire Activision Blizzard — at least for now. The Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/12/23758194/ftc-microsoft-activision-blizzard-complaint-block-acquisition-call-of-duty">on Monday</a> seeking to get the restraining order and a preliminary injunction, and the court <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23845848-ftc-v-microsoft-order-re-tro-and-preliminary-injunction">has agreed</a> to the restraining order while it considers that injunction. If the courts grant the injunction as well, the FTC would have a chance to make its legal case before any deal can be done.</p>
<p id="QzUxkv">As a result of today’s order, Microsoft and Activision cannot complete the acquisition until “after 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time on the fifth business day after the Court rules on the FTC’s request for a preliminary injunction” or a date set by...</p>
