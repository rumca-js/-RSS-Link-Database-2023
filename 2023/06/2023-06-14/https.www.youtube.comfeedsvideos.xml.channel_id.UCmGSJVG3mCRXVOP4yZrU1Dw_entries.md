Thanks to Storyblocks for sponsoring this video.

As the world gets warmer due to man-made climate change, geopolitical competition is heating up in the arctic. And Greenland is finding itself at the center of this competition, as world superpowers fight each other for economic influence and geopolitical control. 

This video was filmed in February 2023 in Greenland, with the help of many people.
