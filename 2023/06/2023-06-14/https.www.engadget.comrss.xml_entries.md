<p>Politicians think they have a way to hold companies accountable for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chatgpt-is-suddenly-everywhere-are-we-ready-180031821.html">troublesome generative AI</a>: take away their legal protection. Senators Richard Blumenthal and Josh Hawley have <a href="https://www.hawley.senate.gov/hawley-blumenthal-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-protect-consumers-and-deny-ai-companies-section">introduced</a> a No Section 230 Immunity for AI Act that, as the name suggests, would prevent OpenAI, Google and similar firms from using the Communications Decency Act's Section 230 to waive liability for harmful content and avoid lawsuits. If someone created a deepfake image or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ai-voice-tool-deepfake-celebrity-audio-clips-094648743.html">sound bite</a> to ruin a reputation, for instance, the tool developer could be held responsible alongside the person who used it.</p><p>Hawley characterizes the bill as forcing AI creators to &quot;take responsibility for business decisions&quot; as they're developing products. He also casts the legislation as a &quot;first step&quot; toward creating rules for AI and establishing safety measures. In a <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/committee-activity/hearings/artificial-intelligence-and-human-rights">hearing</a> this week on AI's effect on human rights, Blumenthal urged Congress to deny AI the broad Section 230 safeguards that have shielded social networks from legal consequences.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In May, Blumenthal and Hawley held a hearing where speakers like OpenAI chief Sam Altman called for the government to act on AI. Industry leaders have already urged a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tech-leaders-and-ai-experts-demand-a-six-month-pause-on-out-of-control-ai-experiments-114553864.html">pause on AI experimentation</a>, and more recently compared the threat of unchecked AI to that of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ai-presents-risk-of-extinction-on-par-with-nuclear-war-industry-leaders-say-114025874.html">nuclear war</a>.</p><p>Congress has pushed for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/house-energy-and-commerce-section-230-hearing-181054717.html">Section 230 reforms</a> for years in a bid to rein in tech companies, particularly over concerns that internet giants might knowingly allow hurtful content. A 2021 House bill would have held businesses liable if they knowingly used <a href="https://www.engadget.com/house-bill-justice-against-malicious-algorithms-act-162915185.html">algorithms that cause emotional or physical harm</a>. These bills have stalled, though, and Section 230 has remained intact. Legislators have had more success in setting <a href="https://www.engadget.com/why-lawmakers-are-pushing-age-verification-requirements-for-social-media-platforms-190037563.html">age verification requirements</a> that theoretically reduce mental health issues for younger users.</p><p>It's not clear this bill stands a greater chance of success. Blumenthal and Hawley are known for introducing online content bills that fail to gain traction, such as the child safety-oriented <a href="https://www.engadget.com/earn-it-act-2022-explained-153058123.html">EARN IT Act </a>and Hawley's anti-addiction <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-30-senate-bill-bans-addictive-social-network-features.html">SMART Act</a>. On top of persuading fellow senators, they'll need an equivalent House bill that  also survives a vote.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/senate-bill-would-hold-ai-companies-liable-for-harmful-content-212340911.html?src=rss

## Sennheiser SoundProtex Plus review: Concert earplugs that don't kill the vibe

<p>I nearly destroyed my hearing during my 20s. I went to <em>a lot </em>of shows in tiny venues with way-too-loud PA systems. Occasionally, I’d remember to grab a set of cheap foam earplugs from a gas station beforehand, but more often than not I just went without. Thankfully, I was never one to enter the pit, so perhaps standing near the back of the room spared me from any severe damage. I have some mild tinnitus, but no hearing loss, and I’m able to fully enjoy all music as I approach 40.</p><p>In my 30s though, I got wise to ear protection at concerts. Unless it’s an outdoor show, I’m taking earplugs. However, those generic foam bits completely close off your ear canal and can really kill the vibe. The sound comes through muffled and boring, and you’re likely to miss the more subtle instrumentation. A number of companies have tried to tackle this challenge, offering various takes on filtered audio that allows good live sound to come through with an appropriate level of hearing protection.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnNlbm5oZWlzZXItaGVhcmluZy5jb20vIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkNDVhNDc4Mi1mZWNkLTQxYmQtYWUyNi02NTkyNjlmYTNlNGYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUa5QUYzp638lO0FKBt6BEut5zcykNlndffaO7a1V6sO&amp;gcReferrer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sennheiser-hearing.com%2F">Sennheiser</a> recently released its <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=70a41cf2-0944-4b2e-9fdd-51f91494e8aa&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sennheiser&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI3MGE0MWNmMi0wOTQ0LTRiMmUtOWZkZC01MWY5MTQ5NGU4YWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9lbi11cy5zZW5uaGVpc2VyLmNvbS9uZXdzcm9vbS9zYWZlLWxpc3RlbmluZy10aGF0LXNvdW5kcy1ncmVhdC1weTZ4M20jIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkNDVhNDc4Mi1mZWNkLTQxYmQtYWUyNi02NTkyNjlmYTNlNGYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdQ79OwnKpCIdVCHjRIRL5kX3LMQO6bbM0bpf8pzhR8R&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fen-us.sennheiser.com%2Fnewsroom%2Fsafe-listening-that-sounds-great-py6x3m%23">SoundProtex earplugs</a> with the aim of doing just that. They’re soft and flexible, made of medical-grade TPE (thermoplastic elastomers) that don’t contain plastics or other potential irritants for sensitive skin. These aren’t single-use earplugs either – you can rinse them under water before storing them until the next event. There’s also a small pouch included so the individual plugs aren’t rolling around in the bottom of your bag.</p><p>The SoundProtex earplugs come in two versions: the regular and the Plus. Each one has three sets of the cone-shaped ear tips in small, medium and large sizes. You can adjust the level of decibel reduction by swapping out tiny round acoustic filters on the outside of each plug. The key difference here is the SoundProtex only comes with the full block filter while the SoundProtex Plus comes with additional low-, medium- and high-blocking filters. The ear tips alone don’t provide any significant protection.</p><p>Since each filter offers a different level of protection, they’re meant for different activities. Sennheiser says the low-block filter should be used for “non-amplified concerts,” offices or bars and restaurants. The medium-block option is suitable for festivals, events and traveling while the high-block are appropriate for loud music, motorsports and using power tools. Those three all have different noise reduction ratings (NRR, single number rating or SRR in the EU) for their level of decibel reduction. Low-block starts out at 10dB, medium is 17dB and high is 20dB. Sennheiser doesn’t disclose a value for the full-block filter, but the goal there is to make things air and water tight to eliminate as much noise as possible (yes, you can wear them in the pool too). While that option does drastically reduce the environmental roar, they don’t create complete silence. But, it’s certainly enough to help you tune out the world.</p><p>Each of the acoustic filters are made with a “tuned” membrane and sound-dampening mesh. Sennheiser says that the latter equally reduces high and low frequencies. The company further explains that the SoundProtex filters are designed to allow just enough of the higher frequencies through to maintain ambient awareness and the ability to have a conversation while you’re wearing them.</p><figure><img alt="Sennheiser SoundProtex Plus" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/c62bdee0-0ae0-11ee-bbf7-6f6e31555b65" style="height: 1333px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>I was able to test Sennheiser’s claims for the SoundProtex Plus at a recent Thrice show for the band’s Artist In The Ambulance 20th anniversary tour. Thrice is one of my favorite bands ever, and this is my favorite album of theirs, so I didn’t want gas station earplugs to ruin the nostalgia. Throughout the show, I used the large eartips with the mid-block filter while my wife wore the medium size with the high-block option. Not only did the SoundProtex offer a superior experience to generic foam earplugs, they are very comfortable to wear for hours at a time. Which, in my opinion, is equally as important.</p><p>While the SoundProtex does indeed dull the high- and low-end frequencies, I didn’t notice a considerable amount of bassy thump missing from the kick drum or treble absent from the guitars. Sure, the overall sonic curve is a bit subdued with these earplugs in, but it doesn’t alter things enough to make me consider going without them. It’s a huge improvement over foam earplugs, and frequent concert goers will get a lot out of the investment. My Apple Watch was consistently hitting 100-105dB on the noise meter, so I would’ve certainly left with my ears ringing. Instead, I was able to drive home normally – no shouty post-show conversations required.</p><p>The SoundProtex doesn’t facilitate conversations quite like Sennheiser describes. I had trouble speaking with the bartender, which forced me to awkwardly resort to hand motions. I also had issues understanding my wife with the earplugs in, so eventually I would just pull one out to chat. Results are better in a quieter environment, without the loud between-set tunes, but if you’re planning to converse while wearing the SoundProtex, the low-block filter is the best option. Of course, that limits your protection so you can only use it in certain environments.</p><figure><img alt="Sennheiser SoundProtex Plus" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/e8c5c010-0ae0-11ee-bb73-338df075c104" style="height: 1333px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Sennheiser designed the SoundProtex ear tips with a pull tab on the outside. This makes removing the earplugs easy since they’re almost entirely pushed into your ear canal once they’re properly situated. This tiny tab gave me the peace of mind that I’d be able to get the things out, which is not to be overlooked.</p><p>One issue concert-goers may have is the price: the SoundProtex is $39.95 and the SoundProtex Plus is $79.95. A 12-pair box of foam earplugs is $3.49 at my local Target. A more appropriate comparison is <a href="https://eargasm.com/products/eargasm-high-fidelity-earplugs?variant=44275577225517"><ins>Eargasm’s high-fidelity earplugs</ins></a>. A set of those comes with one filter with an NRR of 16dB and two sizes of eartips for $41.88. What’s more, Eargasm’s ear tip design is nearly identical to the SoundProtex and they’re made of hypoallergenic soft silicone. There’s also Loop’s line of earplugs which were among the first to promise some degree of hearing protection at concerts without significantly harming the quality of the sound. There are a few options from the company, but <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3VzLmxvb3BlYXJwbHVncy5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvZW5nYWdlIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkNDVhNDc4Mi1mZWNkLTQxYmQtYWUyNi02NTkyNjlmYTNlNGYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAeSfWh8cYsNL8hZOZQMYFiq2rC5h8C0FxZkBeidWeBPO&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fus.loopearplugs.com%2Fproducts%2Fengage"><ins>the Engage</ins></a> are a good place to start. $34.95 buys you 16dB of noise reduction with four ear tip sizes that are more akin to what you put on the ends of your earbuds.</p><p>The SoundProtex Plus is certainly a comfy hearing protection solution that gives you options in terms of the level of noise blocking. They are more expensive than their non-customizable competition, but if you’re just using earplugs at concerts you might not need to swap out filters anyway. However, if you want to adjust how many decibels are being stifled based on what you’re doing, the extra investment will likely enhance your experience. Either way, a set of earplugs designed specifically for use at live music events are a big improvement over the yellow foam plugs. It’s a matter of how much, or how little, you want to dial in the protection.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/sennheiser-soundprotex-plus-review-concert-earplugs-that-dont-kill-the-vibe-193006468.html?src=rss

<p>It’s another day, so here’s another entry in the endless “Twitter is slowly becoming an empty husk” conversation. A judge just evicted the company from its Boulder, Colorado office after three months of unpaid rent, totaling over $75,000, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/14/twitter-is-being-evicted-from-its-boulder-office-over-unpaid-rent/"><ins>as originally reported by </ins><em><ins>TechCrunch</ins></em><ins>.</ins></a> This all started after the landlord took the company to court, according to the <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/denver/news/2023/06/13/boulder-twitter-office-eviction.html"><em><ins>Denver Business Journal.</ins></em></a> The judge sided with the landlord and has given Twitter until the end of July to vacate.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a unique scenario, as Twitter didn’t pay traditional rent for the office. Instead, it was provided a letter of credit worth $968,000 back in 2020, using this credit to pay the landlord. However, the line of credit ran out a few months back and Twitter failed to make any additional payments. Reports indicate that the office is still active, with around 150 in-person employees, down from 300 at its peak.

<p>If Sony is going to enable PS5 game streaming on devices like its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/project-q-is-a-dedicated-ps5-streaming-device-due-later-this-year-211814445.html">Project Q handheld</a>, it needs to offer that streaming in the first place. Thankfully, that's on the horizon. The company is <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/06/14/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-june-ps5-game-streaming-news-update-for-premium-members/">now testing</a> streaming of &quot;supported&quot; PS5 games for PlayStation Plus Premium subscribers, including PS Plus Game Catalog titles and game trials. You'll have to use your PS5 system, but this will save you the trouble of downloading games and chewing up valuable <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-ps5-ssd-expansion-upgrade-150052315.html">SSD space</a>.</p><p>The test is in the &quot;early stages.&quot; A launch window and other details will be available &quot;when we're ready,&quot; Sony says.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>PS Plus Premium normally costs $15 per month and already allows cloud gaming for PS3, PS4 and &quot;classic&quot; titles. You can also stream those titles on a PC. PS5 support should make the tier considerably more appealing, especially as Sony expands access beyond the PS5 itself. Project Q mates an 8-inch display with DualSense-equivalent controls and currently is only confirmed to work with Remote Play directly from a PlayStation 5 that you own.</p><p>This doesn't mean first-party games will be available to stream on launch day, as they sometimes are with Microsoft's Game Pass. Subscriptions head Nick Maguire <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/playstation-confident-in-ps-plus-strategy-as-it-readies-ps5-game-streaming">tells</a><em>GamsIndustry.biz</em> that in-house titles will still be released &quot;outside the service first.&quot; The existing approach of moving games to Premium a year or more later is &quot;working,&quot; according to Maguire.  In other words, the company wants to eke out as many purchases as it can.</p><p>That still provides access to a significant library. As of next week, PS Plus is adding <em>Far Cry 6</em>, <em>Inscryption</em>, <em>Rogue Legacy 2</em> and <em>Soulstice</em> to the PS5 section of the Game Catalog. While those aren't necessarily must-play titles, Premium streaming could make it relatively painless to check them out.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/sony-is-testing-ps5-game-cloud-streaming-for-ps-plus-premium-users-181027926.html?src=rss

<p>Everyone needs a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-password-manager-134639599.html">password manager</a>. It makes it a cinch to juggle complex, unique passwords (you do have those, right?) for every service you use. NordPass is our pick for the best password manager with cross-platform availability. There's a free option that largely does the trick, but there are premium plans that add some useful features.&nbsp;</p><p>Right now, you can <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=72705X1521812&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnordpass.com%2Fplans%2F">save 40 percent on a NordPass personal plan</a>. For $42.96 ($1.79 per month), you'll get two years of premium service. Opt for a two-year family plan, which includes six premium user accounts, and you'll <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=72705X1521812&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnordpass.com%2Fplans%2F">save 53 percent</a>. That option costs $66.96, which works out to $2.79 per month.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p></p><p>The free NordPass plan has no limits on how many passwords you can store. You can sync your data across devices, create automated backups and import information from other password managers. Autofill should make it faster for you to log in to sites and services. You can store notes and credit card details in NordPass, and you can organize your information into folders. There's also passkey support.</p><p>NordPass uses the <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-xchacha20-encryption/">xChaCha2o encryption algorithm</a> to secure your data. Two-factor authentication and biometric login credentials can help with security too. The only password you'll really need to remember is your NordPass master password.&nbsp;</p><p>Upgrade to a premium plan and you can stay logged in to NordPass when you switch devices. You can share information with people you trust and provide access to your passwords during an emergency. Perhaps most usefully, NordPass premium users are warned when they have old, weak and reused passwords. The service will also scan the web for data leaks that may pose a security risk to you.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter and </em><a href="https://subscription.yahoo.net/Newsletter/Preference/sub?b=engadgetdeals&amp;src"><em>subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter</em></a><em> for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/nordpass-password-manager-premium-plans-are-up-to-53-percent-off-180050552.html?src=rss

## Razer Blade 14 laptop refresh features powerful Ryzen 9 and RTX 4070 chips

<p>Razer is <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230614706234/en/The-New-Razer-Blade-14-Is-the-Ultimate-Portable-Gaming-Machine"><ins>back with a refresh</ins></a> for its popular Blade 14 ultra-premium gaming laptop line and the specs are beefier than a trip to the meat-packing plant. There had been speculation as to what chips would power Razer’s latest and greatest, but those questions are now answered. The new Razer Blade 14 features AMD’s Ryzen 9 7940HS with eight cores, 16 threads and a 24MB cache. The basic model ships with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 GPU but it’s upgradeable to the RTX 4070.</p><p>That’s a whole lot of power for modern gaming applications. The laptop features a minimum of 16GB of DDR5 RAM, upgradeable to 32GB. Each model ships standard with 1TB of PCIe Gen 4 storage. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-blade-14-review-amd-ryzen-173003809.html"><ins>The previous generation was already plenty capable,</ins></a> so these upgrades should truly make this an ultra-premium gaming laptop.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="b9e564af183d469eb069afb0e280a0f2"></div><p>As the name suggests, the Razer Blade 14 includes a 14-inch QHD display with a 16:10 aspect ratio and a 240Hz refresh rate. This is a slim laptop, at 0.7 inches, and weighs just four pounds, making it a portable-friendly option for gamers on-the-go. Other features include a pair of USB-C ports, two USB-A ports and a 1080p webcam with a built-in privacy shutter. The 68.1 Wh battery gets around ten hours of battery life per charge and includes a battery health optimization feature and quick-charging capabilities.</p><p>So what’s the downside? This is not a budget-friendly laptop line. The basic RTX 4060 model starts at $2,400 and the RTX 4070 version starts at $2,700. It’s available in both black and white colors and orders start shipping today. The company is throwing in a free Chroma Joyplot Razer Skin, worth $60, to lure in new customers.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/razer-blade-14-laptop-refresh-features-powerful-ryzen-9-and-rtx-4070-chips-175059646.html?src=rss

## UPS tentatively agrees to add air conditioning to its trucks

<p>UPS <a href="https://teamster.org/2023/06/teamsters-secure-air-conditioning-for-ups-fleet-in-major-tentative-deal/">tentatively agreed</a> to equip its delivery trucks with air conditioning for the first time following union negotiations between the company and the Teamsters. “Air conditioning is coming to UPS, and Teamster members in these vehicles will get the relief and protection they’ve been fighting for,” said Teamsters General President Sean M. O’Brien. However, the agreement only requires AC in new delivery vehicles purchased after January 1st, 2024, meaning it won’t likely spell relief for drivers this summer.</p><p>In addition to air conditioning, UPS <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/14/ups-drivers-on-track-to-get-air-conditioned-trucks-for-the-first-time.html">agreed</a> to install cab fans for additional airflow in its delivery vehicles, and the company will install a second fan in those without AC by June 1st, 2024. New vehicles will also get exhaust shields to minimize heat conduction from the powertrain to the van’s floor; existing package cars will add them within 18 months of contract ratification. Finally, new and existing trucks will get air intake vents that bring fresh air from the vehicle’s front to the cargo area to help reduce the sauna-like conditions that can develop in the vehicles’ package-storage areas.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Unless you know someone who works for UPS, you may not have realized the company’s iconic brown delivery vans lacked air conditioning. Unfortunately, it’s common practice: Standard USPS delivery trucks, introduced in 1987, also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/05/24/uspstrucks/">lack AC</a>.

## Ubisoft needs a reboot

<p>At some point in the last console generation, Ubisoft lost its soul. It was a piecemeal erosion process that started in 2015, and it finally resulted in a complete identity collapse somewhere between the studio’s unironic rollout of in-game NFTs and its sixth delay of <em>Skull &amp; Bones</em>. Ubisoft has 40 years of AAA hits and weird licensing deals to its name, and it used to be a pillar of European innovation – but in 2023, it’s selling live-service blandness, mobile ports with microtransactions and unreliable release dates. What even <em>is </em>Ubisoft anymore?</p><figure><img alt="Assassin's Creed Mirage" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/d0bbd8e0-0ac9-11ee-bfdd-758fba86d107" style="height: 2160px; width: 3840px;" /><figcaption>Assassin's Creed Mirage</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Ubisoft</div></figure><p>Ubisoft has been a company longer than most of its players have been alive. It’s responsible for developing and publishing hundreds of games, including iconic franchises like Prince of Persia, Far Cry, Trackmania, the Toms Clancy, Rabbids, Rayman, Just Dance and, of course, Assassin’s Creed.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At the company’s Summer Game Fest show we got reveals of Massive Entertainment’s big licensed games, <em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em> and <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, as well as a proper look at the new 2D Prince of Persia game, which actually seems pretty good. But for the most part we saw sequels, live-service games and mobile titles. <em>XDefiant </em>is a free-to-play team-based shooter, and following an off-key sea shanty performance, we saw <em>Skull &amp; Bones</em> – a live-service game we actually played in 2017 and 2018, but has since been delayed to oblivion. Then there were several mobile-first games like <em>The Division Resurgence</em> and <em>Assassin’s Creed Codename Jade</em>, and a new Crew game, <em>The Crew Motorfest</em>. We also got another Ubisoft TV show and a look at the Assassin’s Creed VR game. It was far from the worst stream of the Summer Game Fest, but it didn’t do much to make people excited about Ubisoft.</p><p>So, let’s talk about how we got here.</p><div id="9c6e313b891644a1b3a572bca93dda84"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>Everything changed for Ubisoft in 2015. <em>Assassin’s Creed: Unity</em> shipped the previous November and proved to be the series’ most busted installment to date. It was the first Assassin’s Creed built specifically for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and Ubisoft overshot it on all fronts: <em>Unity</em> was full of visual and mechanical bugs, and it was so unplayable at launch that Ubisoft publicly apologized for the game and eventually released free DLC, all while furiously rolling out fixes. That same year, Ubisoft debuted <em>Watch Dogs</em>, too – and that game was also disappointing from a visual standpoint, especially compared with its announcement trailers in 2012.</p><p>Until this point, Ubisoft had an annual cadence for Assassin’s Creed, releasing one mainline entry per year from 2009 onward. <em>Syndicate </em>came out in 2015, and by 2016, Ubisoft was openly talking about series fatigue and announced plans to re-evaluate its approach to its tentpole franchise. Notably, longtime producer Jade Raymond left Assassin’s Creed and Ubisoft altogether in October 2014, just before the <em>Unity</em> disaster.</p><figure><img alt="The Crew Motorfest" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/6bf839a0-0acc-11ee-b7ad-62f1ba7ffff8" style="height: 1080px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption>The Crew Motorfest</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Ubisoft</div></figure><p>This was the stage when a French media investor group, Vivendi, attempted to take over Ubisoft. Vivendi began buying up shares in the studio in 2015, and Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot went on a publicity tour against the raid, arguing about the importance of staying independent on-stage at E3 and beyond. Meanwhile, the Guillemot family, which founded Ubisoft in 1986, went on a buying spree of its own, increasing its control of the studio alongside Vivendi. The fight ended in 2018, when Vivendi agreed to sell all of its Ubisoft shares for nearly $2.5 billion, a hefty return on its investment. This deal was able to happen because Vivendi sold a significant chunk of its ownership to Tencent, an existing Ubisoft investor and one of the largest video game companies in the world. At the exact same time, Ubisoft and Tencent, a Chinese company, announced they’d entered a strategic agreement that would bring Ubisoft’s games to PC and mobile devices in China. Since then, Tencent’s stake in Ubisoft has grown significantly, and today, in addition to its studio shares, it owns 49.9 percent of Guillemot Brothers Limited.</p><p>I feel like you can see this period of financial turmoil in Ubisoft’s creative output between 2015 and 2019. Ubisoft was consistently releasing entries in its established franchises, but it wasn’t developing original, genre-shifting hits like it used to. The studio was kind of coasting. In 2019, Ubisoft delayed a number of big games in its lineup – including <em>Skull &amp; Bones</em>, again – and executives said they wanted to slow down even more between releases. In 2020, Ubisoft faced serious allegations of systemic sexual misconduct and sexism, and a handful of longtime leaders were fired or quit.</p><figure><img alt="The Division Resurgence" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/6bf887c0-0acc-11ee-bf5d-223eaf401c8a" style="height: 4320px; width: 7680px;" /><figcaption>The Division Resurgence</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Ubisoft</div></figure><p>On an investor call in 2021, Ubisoft’s CFO said the company was focused on building its library of free-to-play and mobile games. Since then, Ubisoft has done exactly that, developing Rainbow Six, The Division and Assassin’s Creed mobile games, and focusing on live-service iterations of its franchises, old and new. Ubisoft also earnestly tried to make in-game NFTs a thing, which… no.</p><p>The most recent Assassin’s Creed games, <em>Valhalla </em>and <em>Odyssey</em>, have been just fine, but they’ve suffered from the same open-world bloat as Far Cry, offering too-big worlds with too little variety or innovation. The studio’s newest announcements include licensed games, live services, mobile entries and microtransaction specials – with Assassin’s Creed represented in most of these categories. The most intriguing Assassin’s Creed title in Ubisoft’s roster is <em>Mirage</em>, the next mainline entry due out in October. It’s a condensed Assassin’s Creed experience that was initially conceived as a bit of DLC for <em>Valhalla</em>, and it’s an homage to the series roots, with a contained map and a return to stealth-first combat. It sounds like the original Assassin’s Creed – which maxed out at 15 hours or so, rather than 60-plus for the recent games – and it feels like the type of thing Ubisoft players have been looking for over the past eight years. Unfortunately, Ubisoft doesn’t see it that way, and it’s charging just $50 for the game. That’s not a bad thing for players, but when Ubisoft is charging $70 for <em>The Crew Motorfest</em>, it says something about how the studio sees value in terms of game size and paid DLC, rather than substance.</p><figure><img alt="XDefiant" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/d0b82f60-0ac9-11ee-b3fe-0c5b5bc77f18" style="height: 544px; width: 981px;" /><figcaption>XDefiant</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Ubisoft</div></figure><p>To me, <em>Mirage </em>is a welcome step back in terms of scope, but it almost feels like an accident in Ubisoft’s broader plans to build freemium experiences and mobile games for a global market. The studio might be on the cusp of a renaissance, with the space to find its voice and alter the direction of entire genres again, but I don’t think microtransactions and open-world blandness will push it over that edge. Ubisoft used to be weird and profitable in the world of prestige games, but both of those descriptions are fading fast as the studio chases hot monetization trends and relies on the innovations of other creators. <em>Mirage</em> represents one path for Ubisoft, where it chases quality design rather than accounting goals. A game like <em>XDefiant </em>represents another potential altogether – it might be lucrative, but it doesn’t really feel like Ubisoft.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-needs-a-reboot-164531373.html?src=rss

## Sonos lays off 7 percent of its workforce

<p>Sonos is the latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech-layoffs-183005386.html">big tech company laying off staff</a>. The smart speaker brand has <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001314727/9c116897-cd64-4535-92f9-501e40b6ce83.pdf">revealed</a> in an SEC filing that it's cutting 7 percent of its workforce, or about 130 jobs. It's also planning to further shrink its &quot;real estate footprint&quot; and rethink spending on certain programs, according to the filing. This will cost an estimated $11 million to $14 million, up to $11 million of which will be linked to severance and benefits.</p><p>In a statement to Engadget, Sonos chief Patrick Spence says his company already planned to &quot;protect profitability&quot; if performance didn't match expectations. The layoffs and spending changes are the result of &quot;continued headwinds,&quot; the CEO adds.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Sonos has run into financial trouble in recent months. It has swung between narrow profits and losses for multiple quarters, and in the second quarter of 2023 <a href="https://investors.sonos.com/news-and-events/investor-news/latest-news/2023/Sonos-Reports-Second-Quarter-Fiscal-2023-Results/">lost $30.7 million</a> compared to a $8.6 million profit a year earlier. Spence pinned the shortfall on &quot;softening&quot; demand and tightening store inventory, and promised &quot;swift action&quot; to cut costs. It's not clear how much of a role the rough economy played in the reduced sales, but it won't have helped.</p><p>This is the first significant round of layoffs at Sonos since 2020, when the company slashed 12 percent of its headcount due to the difficulties of the COVID-19 pandemic. They also come at a critical moment. Sonos just introduced its most important speakers in years, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-era-100-review-affordable-multi-room-audio-that-actually-sounds-good-130007717.html">Era 100</a> and spatial audio-focused <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-era-300-review-a-big-bet-on-spatial-audio-130053487.html">Era 300</a>, and is still <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-fined-325-million-for-infringing-on-sonos-patent-210411398.html">fighting Google over patent royalties</a>. It's also facing renewed competition that includes the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-homepod-review-2nd-generation-140040630.html">second-generation Apple HomePod</a>. The market is evolving, and Sonos is under pressure to keep up.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/sonos-lays-off-7-percent-of-its-workforce-161529844.html?src=rss

## Google Search can now help detect skin conditions and show how clothes look on AI models

<p>Google has announced a slew of new search updates, ranging from travel planning to clothes shopping — oh, and a bit of skin abnormality checking for good measure. That's right, Lens is no longer just for naming a plant or historical object but will now identify things about your skin. You simply upload a picture into Lens, and it will show you similar images. This update might be good for determining if you have a tick bite, but, like any Google searches when you're not feeling well, it could lead you down a pretty scary rabbit hole. Try to consult with a doctor if there are any spots you're unsure about across your skin.</p><figure><img alt="Google Lens shows image options for what a skin condition might be.

You can now search by filters like style, color and pattern across retailers. Then, when you do find what you're looking for, Google is attempting to solve the main problem of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-15-google-shopping-clothes-search.html">shopping for clothes online</a>: uncertainty about how it will really look on you. It's releasing a new virtual try-on tool that shows what the same top would look like on a diverse range of models. The program utilizes a generative AI technique to show the fit and look of the fabric. Right now, it's only available when shopping for tops at select retailers like H&amp;M, Everlane, Anthropologie and Loft.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Google is also releasing quite a few new travel-centric features. For starters, it's expanding <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-maps-is-expanding-immersive-view-to-routes-170618016.html">Immersive View</a>, a tool that lets you explore a 3D model of a city, to include Florence, Venice, Dublin and Amsterdam — along with letting you get close and personal with another 500 landmarks worldwide. Immersive View already exists across cities like Tokyo and New York, as well as for hundreds of interesting sights.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="An AI summary on Google Search of the Bean in Chicago" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/2d9ef740-0a9d-11ee-9f7b-5e6b7079b76e" style="height: 445px; width: 800px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Whether you have an iOS or Android phone, Google is rolling out a feature that lets you follow your trip right from the route overview or your lock screen. The &quot;glanceable directions&quot; provide ETA updates and instructions for walking, biking or driving. The desktop version of Google Maps is also updating &quot;Recents&quot; to improve trip planning and allow you to work on multiple itineraries at once by saving everything to your highlights.&nbsp;</p><p>In the vein of trip planning, you can also access an AI-generated summary about different locations from articles, reviews and photos. It's available through <a href="https://www.engadget.com/googles-search-labs-lets-you-test-its-ai-powered-products-and-ideas-175254478.html">Search Labs</a>, Google's testing center that opened up to the public in May — but there's still a waitlist.

## Meta is expanding its bonus program that pays creators for Facebook posts

<p>Meta is trying to lure more creators to Facebook with new monetization features. The changes come as the company looks to make the short form videos and AI-driven recommendations a more central part of its primary social network.</p><p>First, Meta’s “performance bonus program,” which rewards creators <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2d66651e-658e-4baa-bc4e-ded0c126e805&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Portal+from+Facebook&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyZDY2NjUxZS02NThlLTRiYWEtYmM0ZS1kZWQwYzEyNmU4MDUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZmFjZWJvb2suY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2hlbHAvOTI4NTcxOTY1MDEwNDYwP2xvY2FsZT1lbl9VUyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNWQxN2NkNjEtYzQyZi00MDRlLTkyYTMtODI0Zjg4ZTQzYzM2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAUDgyTvzhgMbtd5IDSAKKuLI_KBIRpmFDO-QwZ6y5APO&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fbusiness%2Fhelp%2F928571965010460%3Flocale%3Den_US"><ins>for engagement</ins></a> on their Facebook posts, is “expanding significantly.” The program is still invitation-only, but the company is planning to enroll more creators and add additional bonuses to boost their potential earnings. The expansion comes after Meta previously <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-is-pausing-bonus-payouts-for-reels-creators-000040951.html">cut payouts</a> from a bonus program that paid creators for engagement with Reels. It's notable, then, that the performance bonus program is geared toward Facebook feed posts, not Reels or Stories. In a blog post, Meta notes that “most successful creators in this program post regularly, typically every day,” with a combination of text and photo posts.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Meta is adding new bonuses for creators to get paid for Facebook posts." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/0c5b73c0-0a9c-11ee-9b6e-cfd9820db647" style="height: 1080px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Meta</div></figure><p>Meta is also testing two new features that could make it easier to share content between Instagram and Facebook. The company will be experimenting with cross-posting for branded content so creators can more easily share sponsored posts from Instagram in Reels and Stories on Facebook. A separate test will allow “select creators” to make money <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-is-accelerating-plans-to-bring-more-ads-to-reels-on-facebook-and-instagram-150004225.html"><ins>from Reels</ins></a> that include licensed musical tracks from the company’s audio library.</p><p>According to Meta, the updates are meant to help creators “earn steady streams of income on Facebook.” But the changes also seem designed to boost creator engagement with Facebook as the platform struggles to hold the interest of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/facebook-teenagers-tiktok-instagram-young-adults-fc9f6daa605e7c7f6fd5f4eaa90141fa?utm_campaign=article_email&amp;utm_content=article-10458&amp;utm_source=sg&amp;utm_medium=email"><ins>younger users</ins></a>, who are more interested in TikTok and Instagram.</p><p>Getting more creators to post more original content to Facebook will also be an important part of Meta’s  <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-app-redesign-tiktok-recommendations-221943589.html"><ins>strategy</ins></a> to shift its main social network away from feeds toward a more TikTok-like “discovery engine” in the coming year. But in order to reorient Facebook around recommendations, Meta will first need a much bigger pool of original creator content to keep users scrolling.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/meta-is-expanding-its-bonus-program-that-pays-creators-for-facebook-posts-150533570.html?src=rss

## Zwift launches dedicated game controllers for its bike-based fitness platform

<p>The Zwift virtual cycling platform is <a href="https://news.zwift.com/en-WW/d27236c009be8e97b8262e2eb084002b022f0264f703ec61746f1ea48e3fdff0">getting a dedicated first-party game controller</a> to simplify and improve the user experience. The Zwift Play controller attaches to the handlebars and provides a full suite of input options, with a directional pad, programmable analog buttons and a paddle on the back of each handle for braking and steering. The device attaches via silicone straps and integrates with most drop handlebar designs.</p><p>Prior to this release, Zwift users who wanted additional control options were stuck choosing from a couple of bare-bones third-party options and Bluetooth-enabled e-racing controllers that weren’t designed to optimize the company's digital fitness experience. Also, many of these devices struggled to integrate with the Zwift Companion app, which is where most users otherwise access certain features of the experience.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Zwift Play controllers give users “complete control” and allows for easy U-Turns and general navigation throughout a multitude of virtual worlds. To that end, the buttons are programmable to allow for shortcuts like deploying power ups and teleporting to multiplayer races. That means less reaching for your phone or a keyboard while riding, which is certainly helpful.</p><div id="89108b72039646478b1bc9b9d7808b3d"></div><p>The controller is launching alongside some brand-new software, called the Beta Zwift Play Game Experience. A game mode called Repack Rush exists as a tutorial of sorts, teaching new users how to make the most of their controllers, with more games launching in the near future. There’s also going to be more multiplayer tournaments like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/zwift-esports-cycling-championship-wahoo-kickr-153307855.html">annual UCI Cycling Esports World Championships,</a> held in a virtual recreation of Central Park.</p><p>Zwift Play controllers are available starting today in the USA and Europe. The controllers are available with a discount at first, costing $100, but raise up to $150 once the initial beta testing phase has completed.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/zwift-launches-dedicated-game-controllers-for-its-bike-based-fitness-platform-150046881.html?src=rss

They'll include reality and documentary shows such as <em>Cake Boss, Extreme Couponing, Ghost Brothers, Paranormal Lockdown, Say Yes to the Dress </em>and <em>Long Lost Family.</em></p><p>WBD has made a push into FAST channels in recent months in an attempt to generate more revenue.

The Alexa ecosystem is also robust, so you won't have problems finding services and smart home devices (including the smart plug, of course) you can control with your voice.

Now, developer FromSoftware, flying high from <em>Elden Ring</em> and<em> Dark Souls</em> glory, is returning to mechs, with what it says is a remastered, reimagined take on robot combat. The last time I extensively played a mech game was Konami’s <em>Zone Of The Enders</em> space opera –  and that was back in 2003. I think it’s time for a true mech gaming boom.</p><p>In a hands-off demo at Summer Game Fest, I saw roughly 15 minutes of <em>Armored Core VI </em>gameplay, set in an early icy stage filled with vertiginous factory structures and tightly-packed warehouses. These dense environments immediately demonstrate how modern consoles can elevate FromSoftware’s newest mech game.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="25759ac0d4044cf3b8186e139cd6c3b7"></div><p>Since mechs can move around in all three planes, expect to see plenty of levels and architecture that take advantage of that. <em>ACVI</em> producer, Yasunori Ogura, noted that you’d be able to go anywhere in a level, flying “as far as your boost system allows”. He teased that several missions offer multiple paths and ways to achieve your objectives. In the snowy level I saw, he said the player could fly to the top of a structure to make their way into a base, or (and what I saw) you can just rush in, guns blazing, to the main entrance.</p><p>At the heart of <em>Armored Core VI</em> is your mech loadout. Alongside components affecting energy levels, defense and speed, you can attach weapons to four slots: one in each arm and two on the back, like multi-lock missiles. Arm weapons can range from rifles and machine guns through to light-saber-esque blades and more.</p><p>As anyone who’s played an <em>AC</em> game can attest to, your mech design choices will be crucial. You’ll be able to create a lighter, agile mech that can float in the air longer, dodge attacks and probably not take a lot of damage. Or, you could go heavy-duty, making a slower-moving robot with an array of long-range attacks and powerful melee weaponry. You’ll also need to balance out the energy demands of your mech against the power generator component.</p><figure><img alt="Armored Core 6" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/ef30dbf0-097e-11ee-beef-9296b0de6fca" style="height: 1350px; width: 2400px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Bandai Namco</div></figure><p>While you can expect a degree of exploration as you fly around these huge environments, the game will be mission-based, just like its predecessors.  Each stage begins with a briefing about your mission, some backstory and an outline of what you need to accomplish. If you’re here for the story,<em> Armored Core VI </em>is set on a distant planet of Rubicon 3. The planet is the home of a new energy source, one that’s so powerful and volatile that it caused a cataclysmic event in the past that “engulfed the entire star system in flames”.</p><p>If you were expecting a more Souls-style approach to the Armored Core series, you’d likely be disappointed, going off both the hands-off demo I saw and comments from FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki. In an interview with <em>IGN</em>, he said the studio would stick to what makes the Armored Core series &quot;special&quot;, which he believes is the breadth and depth of mech customization. But like <em>Dark Souls</em> et al., major fights against more capable mechs could prove to be a highlight.</p><p>During the hands-off demo, the player dodged around a powerful molten steel-flinging mech, boosting above it to reveal a weak spot. You’ll be able to stagger enemies to deal bigger damage, another dynamic you’ll need to pay attention to when selecting your mech’s composition.</p><p>The fiery mech soon bested the player in the demo, but this meant they could make some adjustments and changes to their mech, retooling it specifically to take down this boss. In this instance, they swapped in more agile legs and a rifle capable of doing more substantial stun damage. A new Armored Core game is long overdue. Hopefully, it’ll be worth the wait.</p><p><em>Armored Core VI will be released on August 25th on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X and S, Xbox One and PC .</em></p><p><em>Catch up on all of the news from Summer Game Fest </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/sgf-2023"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/armored-core-vi-fires-of-rubicon-first-look-140011240.html?src=rss

## EU could breakup Google’s ad business over antitrust violations

<p>Europe has accused Google of "abusive practices in online advertising technology" that could lead to its ad business being split up, the EU Commission wrote in a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_3207">statement of objections</a>. It found preliminarily that since Google is unlikely to change its behavior, only the "mandatory divestment" of part of its services would address competition concerns.</p><p>"Google is present at almost all levels of the so-called adtech supply chain," executive VP Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. "Our preliminary concern is that Google may have used its market position to favor its own intermediation services. Not only did this possibly harm Google’s competitors but also publishers’ interests, while also increasing advertisers’ costs."</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Google's ad business is now under attack on several fronts. Earlier this year, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/justice-department-sues-google-to-break-up-the-companys-digital-ad-business-190131636.html">sued Google</a> to break up its ad business, accusing it of illegally monopolizing the market. That in turn forced key ad tech rivals to abandon the market, dissuade new ones from joining and left the few remaining competitors "marginalized and unfairly disadvantaged," the regulator said.</p><blockquote><p>There is nothing wrong with being dominant as such. What our investigation has shown though, is that Google appears to have abused its market position. It did so by ensuring that both its intermediation tools on the buy- side and on the sell-side would favour AdX in the “matching” auctions.</p></blockquote><p>The EU Commission said Google is dominant in virtually all parts of adtech via services for both advertisers and publishers, along with an ad exchange called AdX. That would be fine by itself, but it accused Google of abusing its market position by making sure both its buy- and sell-side intermediation tools would favor its own exchange. "In other words, we are concerned about two potentially anticompetitive conducts by Google, which are both about favoring AdX," the Commission wrote.</p><p>In one case, AdX was able to bid after all other bidders had done so, and in another, it was informed in advance of the value of the best bids from rivals. On the supply side, Google Ads placed bids nearly exclusively on its own exchange, giving it a significant advantage over competitor's exchanges, according to the EU.</p><p>The Commission said that any remedy demanding Google change its behavior would be ineffective. "The Commission's preliminary view is therefore that only the mandatory divestment by Google of part of its services would address its competition concerns," according to the statement of objections.</p><p>Google will now be able to respond to the complaint before any judgement is issued. On top of being split up, the company could face a fine of up to 10 percent of its yearly global turnover, pending any appeal. It's unusual for the EU to suggest any remedy ahead of a guilty judgement, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2f007401-3eaa-4237-b69b-54ccbe125502&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Wall+Street+Journal&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyZjAwNzQwMS0zZWFhLTQyMzctYjY5Yi01NGNjYmUxMjU1MDIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9ldS1zYXlzLWl0LW1heS1zZWVrLWJyZWFrdXAtb2YtZ29vZ2xlcy1hZC10ZWNoLWJ1c2luZXNzLWI5ODhmZDc4P21vZD1yc3NfVGVjaG5vbG9neSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMWI4ZDBjYzktMzc4ZS00ZGE5LWE0OTItZjk1YzAzYTQwN2FkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAaK6m6Ispxrtt6Wjru4IUBMltvT9NhSh3osGmVufajpz&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Feu-says-it-may-seek-breakup-of-googles-ad-tech-business-b988fd78%3Fmod%3Drss_Technology"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> noted.

<p>Vodafone has announced its intentions to <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9b23836e-c3be-48b9-892f-f3feecde9add&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Vodafone+Australia&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5YjIzODM2ZS1jM2JlLTQ4YjktODkyZi1mM2ZlZWNkZTlhZGQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudm9kYWZvbmUuY29tL25ld3MvY29ycG9yYXRlLWFuZC1maW5hbmNpYWwvbWVyZ2VyLXZvZGFmb25lLXVrLXRocmVlLXVrLWV1cm9wZS1sZWFkaW5nLTVnLW5ldHdvcmtzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyYmZlODYwOS0xNDNkLTQxYjEtYTk3NC1hMDMzOGE4Zjc4Y2YifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAf9UNgjQhq_kRC1XJNt4NKxZrTrqdNvszVMSzfDd7jXL&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vodafone.com%2Fnews%2Fcorporate-and-financial%2Fmerger-vodafone-uk-three-uk-europe-leading-5g-networks">merge with Three</a>, pulling together the UK’s two remaining standalone mobile networks. The move comes in a market that has seen major consolidations in recent years between <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-media-o2-liberty-global-telefonica-merger-081409576.html">Virgin Media's merger with O2</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-01-29-bt-ee-acquisition-complete.html">BT Group's purchase of EE</a>. If regulators approve the deal, Vodafone and Three's new company will become the largest mobile phone operator in the UK, with an estimated 27 million customers.&nbsp;</p><p>"Three UK and Vodafone UK currently lack the necessary scale on their own to earn their cost of capital. This has long been a challenge for Three UK's ability to invest and compete," (Three Owner) CK Hutchinson Group Co-Managing Director Canning Fok said in a statement. "Together, we will have the scale needed to deliver a best-in-class 5G network for the UK, transforming mobile services for our customers and opening up new opportunities for businesses across the length and breadth of the UK." Vodafone will own 51 percent of the company, while CK Hutchinson controls the rest.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The merger with Vodafone isn't the first time Three has tried to couple up with a competitor. In 2015, its parent company announced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-05-11-ec-blocks-three-o2-merger.html">plans to buy O2 for £10.25 billion</a> ($12.96 billion), but the European Commission and Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) blocked the purchase over concerns of "reduced competition" and "higher prices." However, O2 was able to merge with Virgin Media in 2021 after the CMA determined that similar concerns were unfounded. Vodafone and Three are attempting to sweeten the latest deal with a promise to invest £11 billion ($13.9 billion) across ten years in the UK's 5G infrastructure, in line with the government's targets.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/vodafone-and-three-plan-to-merge-into-the-uks-largest-mobile-network-123642148.html?src=rss

## The Morning After: OpenAI and Microsoft aren’t happy

<p>Microsoft may own almost half of OpenAI, but a recent expose hints <a href="https://www.engadget.com/openai-reportedly-warned-microsoft-about-rushing-gpt-4-integration-into-bing-182044458.html"><ins>the pair aren’t the happiest of bedfellows</ins></a>. <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> claims the AI company warned Microsoft not to incorporate GPT-4 into Bing search without further training, but it did so anyway. It resulted in several high-profile examples of odd behavior, including bots arguing with users, and at least one instance of a user being urged to dissolve their marriage and elope with Bing instead.</p><p>There’s resentment, too, on Microsoft’s side, finding its own internal AI projects overlooked in favor of OpenAI. Which, despite the close financial ties, is very much free to work with Microsoft’s rivals in plenty of fields. It’s led to a situation where the pair are working together, and yet against one another.

<p>Google released its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/googles-redesigned-home-app-is-available-to-everyone-185733317.html">redesigned Home app</a> last month, adding routines to give users more control over smart home automations. Now, it's introducing a new script editor, the company announced in a <a href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Blog/Create-powerful-automations-with-our-new-script-editor-now-available-in/ba-p/433461">Google Nest blog post</a>. It gives users even more granular control over automations, letting them do things like &quot;dim lights and lower blinds when the living room TV is on after dark,&quot; to cite one Google example. It does require some basic programming abilities, though, as it uses the YAML data serialization language.&nbsp;</p><p>Building an automation requires three elements: starters, conditions and actions. A starter triggers the automation, for example flipping on the TV in the above example. Conditions, meanwhile, are prerequisites to be met before the script will run; for example the time must be between sunset and sunrise. Finally, actions specify which devices will then be triggered, i.e., lowering the blinds and turning off the lights.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Google Home's new script editor can make smart home automations even more powerful" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/ae8aaff0-0a9a-11ee-bfdf-6ec790dab1c5" style="height: 1013px; width: 1600px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>While Google already offers a decent level of control with routines, you can't do things like program multiple starters in an automation or set conditions. The script editor, in comparison, allows the use of nearly 100 starters, conditions and actions that can be used for creating custom automations.&nbsp;</p><p>The script editor is available in a public preview build of the Google Home app or on the web, along with a variety of <a href="https://developers.home.google.com/automations/example-scripts">sample scripted automations</a>. Google has provided a <a href="https://developers.home.google.com/codelabs/create-a-scripted-automation#0">step-by-step guide</a> as well. It works across Google Home and third-party smart home devices, and automations work with popular sensors including Matter-supported sensors.

<p>You probably wouldn't think of McDonald's if you're asked to guess which company would release a retro game this year. But yes, the fast food giant did indeed <a href="https://gizmodo.com/mcdonald-nintendo-game-boy-color-game-grimace-birthday-1850534966">launch</a> a 2D retro game seemingly in the style of Game Boy Color, and it's all in celebration of <a href="https://grimacesbirthday.com/">Grimace's 52nd birthday</a>. The company teamed up with Krool Toys to develop the platformer that you can play on a modern PC or a mobile device. In it, you control Grimace on a skateboard as he searches for his missing friends — and collect enough milkshake for all his guests — before his birthday party begins.</p><p>While I fumbled a bit trying to control the purple mascot as he jumped over obstacles and slid across hand rails, I could only blame my own clumsy handling of the game's controls. The game worked smoothly on a computer, and you can even expand the screen if you don't mind getting blurry graphics, which truly do look like they were created for Nintendo's old handheld. The game was <a href="https://gbstudiocentral.com/news/mcdonalds-celebrates-grimaces-birthday-with-a-gb-studio-game/">most likely created</a> using a drag-and-drop tool for Nintendo handheld games called GB Studio. Indie developers like Krool have been using the program to create retro games, because doing so from scratch is typically very time- and resource-consuming. As a nice nostalgia-inducing bonus, even the <a href="https://grimacesbirthday.com/">website for the game</a> is a throwback to the era marked by colorful and busy Angelfire, Lycos and Geocities web pages.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>McDonald's only officially released <em>Grimace's Birthday</em> as a fun little game you can play on PC and mobile, but people were quickly able to find and share a <a href="https://archive.org/details/grimaces-birthday-v1.2">copy</a> you can download. While it's not an official release, it will allow you to play the game on a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/analogue-pocket-review-150056011.html">Game Boy emulator</a> in case have one.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mcdonalds-just-released-a-grimace-game-boy-color-game-093540230.html?src=rss

It's designed to deliver backup power to both existing and new solar installation, and Anker promises it will "provide high levels of safety and durability, seamlessly transfer to off-grid power and be compatible with home energy equipment such as heat pumps, oil- and gas-powered generators." It will also work with a "forthcoming EV charging solution," the company wrote.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The system will use lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries and operate at temperatures ranging from -20C to 55C (-4F to 131F).

## Microsoft-Activision Blizzard merger temporarily blocked by US judge

<p>The FTC has notched a win, albeit a temporary one, in its bid to prevent Microsoft from closing its deal with Activision Blizzard. According to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9843e75d-0f1d-4db2-be0e-756cec85d503"><em>The Financial Times</em></a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-14/microsoft-purchase-of-activision-temporarily-blocked-by-judge"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, a US federal judge has issued an order that temporarily blocks the companies from finalizing their $68.7 billion deal while waiting for the court to decide on the FTC's request for a preliminary injunction. If you'll recall, the agency has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-expected-to-file-injunction-to-block-microsofts-purchase-of-activision-blizzard-165738788.html">filed for an injunction</a> in response to news reports that the companies were closing the deal &quot;imminently&quot; and that they had set July 18th as the target deadline for the acquisition.</p><p>Judge Edward J. Davila has ruled that the merger can't take place until five days after the court has decided on whether or not to issue an injunction against it. To note, the court is scheduled to hear the FTC's request for an injunction on June 22nd and 23rd, so the earliest the companies can proceed with their plans is the end of this month — if the court doesn't ultimately side with the agency. The commission said in its filing:</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;With control of Activision's content, Microsoft would have the ability and increased incentive to withhold or degrade Activision’s content in ways that substantially lessen competition — including competition on product quality, price, and innovation.&quot;</p><p>Microsoft and Activision Blizzard, however, seem to be unperturbed by the FTC's lawsuit. In a statement, Microsoft told us that the injunction request is &quot;accelerating the legal process&quot; that will help the merger move forward sooner. &quot;A temporary restraining order makes sense until we can receive a decision from the court, which is moving swiftly,&quot; a spokesperson also told <em>The Times</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>In May, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-eu-approves-microsofts-687-billion-activision-blizzard-takeover-160319415.html">European Union approved</a> the acquisition, as long as Microsoft agreed to release popular Activision Blizzard games on competing cloud gaming services. But the companies still have to convince US and UK authorities to allow the merger to push through. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-microsoft-activision-blizzard-antitrust-competition-lawsuit-191341476.html">FTC filed an antitrust complaint</a> in December 2022 to block the deal over worries that it &quot;would enable Microsoft to suppress competitors to its Xbox gaming consoles and its rapidly growing subscription content and cloud-gaming business.&quot; That particular lawsuit was filed at the agency's in-house court, and the commission's administrative law judge is scheduled to hear the case in August.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-merger-temporarily-blocked-by-us-judge-061933491.html?src=rss
