For a band whose latest album is currently soundtracking its second straight Pride Month, MUNA has found a deep kinship with queer audiences \u2014 a fact Gavin noted during the lead-in to a country reworking of 2021\u2019s irresistible \u201cSilk Chiffon.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe love being queer, and we find a lot of joy in it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe think, like, if the world is gonna change in the way that it needs to, it\u2019s very important for our revolution to be based on joy, and what brings us joy, and chasing after that.\u201d\n\n\u201cSilk Chiffon\u201d embodies that idea, but it\u2019s also deepened by the version MUNA unveiled here: As its melody was transformed by a string-infused arrangement, it revealed a clear undercurrent of yearning only hinted at in the original.\n\nExpanded into a septet, MUNA used the setting as an opportunity to lean into its moodier side. \u201cLoose Garment\u201d placed Naomi McPherson at the piano as Gavin applied subtle effects to her own plaintive voice. And \u201cStayaway,\u201d a highlight from 2019\u2019s Saves The World, placed such a demand on the three voices at MUNA\u2019s core \u2014 Gavin, McPherson and Josette Maskin \u2014 that they practically exploded with relief when it was over.\n\nMUNA\u2019s appearance happened to coincide with a loosening of pandemic restrictions at the Tiny Desk \u2014 most notably the hard cap on the number of audience members who could attend. It was hard to miss the sense of liberation, and the surge of energy, in the sheer size of the crowd.\n\nSET LIST\n\u201cLoose Garment\u201d\n\u201cStayaway\u201d\n\u201cSilk Chiffon\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS\nKatie Gavin: vocals, mandolin\nJosette Maskin: guitar, vocals\nNaomi McPherson: guitar, piano, synth, vocals\nGeo Botelho: bass\nSarab Singh: drums, percussion\nTia Allen: viola, violin\nSusan D.
