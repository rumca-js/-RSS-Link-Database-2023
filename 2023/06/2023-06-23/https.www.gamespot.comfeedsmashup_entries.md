## Secret Invasion Could Take A Big Step Toward Fixing The MCU's Story Problems

<p>The first episode of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvels-secret-invasion-review-the-mcu-tries-its-own-andor-with-mixed-results/1900-6418079/">Marvel's Secret Invasion series was a solid start</a> to a spy series that could upend the Marvel Cinematic Universe, in which a group of extremist shape-shifting Skrull refugees are plotting to take over Earth and, in the process, kill the humans who live there. It's well-written, the cast is uniformly great, it doesn't look like it was shot on an extremely fake-looking CGI soundstage. I can't help but hope that this will be a rare Marvel season that manages to start well and then maintain its quality.</p><p dir="ltr">But the first episode of Secret Invasion also gave me a feeling I've been getting from the MCU a lot over the past few years: Why wasn't this story ever set up or teased before now? There have been 11 movies and eight seasons of TV that have come out since the Skrulls were introduced in Captain Marvel, but all that Marvel has done with them since is to very occasionally remind us that Nick Fury's green pals are still around. And there's been <em>nothing</em>, meanwhile, about these secret other Skrulls who are doing that titular invasion.</p><p dir="ltr"><b>Warning: This article contains light spoilers for the first episode of Secret Invasion, and it also discusses major plot details from some past Marvel series, like The Falcon and the Winter Soldier and WandaVision.</b></p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/secret-invasion-could-take-a-big-step-toward-fixing-the-mcus-story-problems/1100-6515469/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## It Sure Seems Like All The Big Studios Are Skipping San Diego Comic-Con This Year

<p>San Diego Comic-Con has been struggling ever since the COVID-19 pandemic forced just about everything to shut down in 2020. Since then, it seems like one thing after another is making it tough for these live events to go on. Many of the big studios we're used to seeing in San Diego every year will be absent for San Diego Comic-Con 2023, <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/comic-con-schedule-marvel-netflix-hbo-sony-universal-skipping-1235653256/">Variety</a> reports.</p><p>It's a long list: Disney's Marvel Studios and Lucasfilm, HBO, Sony Pictures, Universal Pictures, and Netflix are all skipping SDCC this year. Warner Bros. hasn't made an official announcement one way or the other, and NBC is waiting on rumors of an impending actors' strike, Variety notes. Paramount and Amazon, however, do plan to have some presence.</p><p>So what's going on? Most apparent is the current <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/wga-strong-rally-labor-leaders-solidarity-amptp-1235520297/">ongoing writers' strike</a> and the rumored <a href="https://www.avclub.com/dermot-mulroney-wants-actors-to-strike-immediately-1850570233">potential strike by the Screen Actors Guild</a>. While both strikes affect these studios, an actors' strike would be disastrous--it's impossible to get actors on stage to talk about their upcoming projects when they're busy holding a picket line for fair pay. Studios aren't going to want to make plans for a bunch of actor-filled panels if they think the actors might not be there.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/it-sure-seems-like-all-the-big-studios-are-skipping-san-diego-comic-con-this-year/1100-6515471/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Cyberpunk 2077 Shows Bad Launches Don't Always Kill Games  | Spot On

<p>At Summer Game Fest, Tam and Lucy went hands-on with Phantom Liberty, Cyberpunk 2077's upcoming expansion, but during the session they discovered that CD Projekt Red has tweaked and changed almost every major gameplay system in the open-world RPG. Cyberpunk 2077 didn't have the smoothest launch, but over time the game has been updated with patches to improve performance, free DLC to tie in with Netflix's Edgerunners show, reigniting interest around the game. And now, with a huge overhaul to its systems, Cyberpunk 2077 is poised to complete its redemption, with many once again excited to return to Night City.</p><div>          </div><p>In this episode of Spot On, Tam and Lucy discuss whether or not it's worth giving games with bad launches a second chance, and discuss similar redemption arcs,like No Man's Sky, Final Fantasy XIV, and GTA Online. They talk about when it might be right for a company to continue working on a title, and when they should cut their losses and run.</p><p>Spot On is a weekly news show airing Fridays in which GameSpot's managing editor Tamoor Hussain and senior producer Lucy James talk about the latest news in games. Given the highly dynamic and never-ending news cycle of the massive video game industry, there's always something to talk about but, unlike most other news shows, Spot On will dive deep into a single topic as opposed to recapping all the news. Spot On airs each Friday.</p>

## How Marvel, Just Not Twin Peaks, Inspired Alan Wake 2

<p>It's no secret Twin Peaks has served as a key inspiration for the Alan Wake series, but it's not the only piece of pop culture guiding Remedy Entertainment's upcoming sequel. Some are obvious, but less apparent are some of its bigger influences--the work of Marvel--that have factored into the upcoming survival-horror game.</p><p dir="ltr">Alan Wake 2's co-director Kyle Rowley told me in an interview that while the game's writer/director Sam Lake and many other members of the team use inspirations like Twin Peaks as motivation, Rowley's interests, on the other hand, aren't quite cut from the same cloth. Which, in turn, serves as a counter-balance to the game's more obtuse Twin Peaks-isms.</p><p dir="ltr">"You know I like David Lynch--he's cool. But personally, I'm not a massive Twin Peaks fan," Rowley said. Instead, he considers himself more of a Marvel guy, a benefit that allows him to view the game from a broader lens. "I'm trying to think about how we can bring slightly more--I don't want to say mainstream--but things that aren't such obscure references into the kind of games that we make. I kind of try and balance that a bit with like, 'Hey, I don't get this, this, and this. And if I don't get it, there's other people who aren't going to get it.'" There are still plenty of inspirations Alan Wake 2 is pulling from that tiptoe into the less surreal and obscure, like Coen brothers' Fargo and True Detective, for example.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-marvel-just-not-twin-peaks-inspired-alan-wake-2/1100-6515464/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Every Super Mario RPG, Ranked

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1701/17013431/4156794-mariorpgshed.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Mario might be known to some as "Jumpman,” but some of the plumber's best games are actually RPGs, not platformers.</p><p dir="ltr">Taking a platformer series known more for its gameplay than its story or worldbuilding into the narrative-rich RPG genre may sound like an odd choice, but Mario made the transition very well back with the original Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars on the SNES. In fact, Mario's first RPG worked so well that not only is the beloved SNES classic now getting a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-rpg-preorder-guide/1100-6515379/">full remake for the Nintendo Switch</a> later this year, but it also spawned multiple Mario-themed RPG sub-series, including the humorous adventures of the Mario &amp; Luigi series, the ever-evolving Paper Mario franchise, and even a duo of tactics RPGs with Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle and Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope.</p><p dir="ltr">So far, Nintendo's main man has starred in 14 RPGs--a surprising number for a mascot mostly known for running and jumping. And while not all of Mario's role-playing outings measure up to the quality of genre pillars as, say, Chrono Trigger, there are several that easily rank among the best RPGs on their respective systems, and a few could be counted among the very best RPGs of all time. That's pretty good for a dude mostly known for jumping on things and saying "Wahoo!"</p><p dir="ltr">In light of the upcoming Super Mario RPG releasing on Switch on November 17, and the fact that multiple other classic Mario RPGs are now easily available on the Nintendo Switch via the Nintendo Switch Online service, we decided to rank Mario's many RPGs into a definitive list.</p><div><div class="norewrite" title="6515379 - Super Mario RPG Preorders">    <div class="buylink__container">                                                                                                                                                                                               <div class="buylink__item">                  <div class="buylink__image-container clickable">                                            <img alt="" class="buylink__image" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4155925-supermariorpg.png" />                                 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8VKNJ1B?tag=gamespot-promos-20"></a>                              </div>                   <div class="buylink__text">                      <p class="buylink__title text-bold">                        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8VKNJ1B?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Preorder Super Mario RPG</a>           </p>                                                       <p class="buylink__deck">                          <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8VKNJ1B?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$60</a>             </p>                                              </div>                  <div class="buylink__links">                                                       <input class="buylink__extra" type="checkbox" />                                                                                                                          <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8VKNJ1B?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Preorder at Amazon</a>                                                                                                                                                                           <a href="https://shop-links.co/1811799359871464669?u1=subid_value">Preorder at Best Buy</a>                                                                                                                                                                           <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=VZfI20jEa0c&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/nintendo-switch/products/super-mario-rpg---nintendo-switch/396423.html">Preorder at GameStop</a>                     </div>                         </div>                     </div> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>If you're curious how we feel about Mario's other games, be sure to check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-mario-games/2900-3811/">our rankings of every Super Mario platfomer</a>.

Sticker Star swaps out the varied characters and in-depth narrative of previous games for platformer-lite level design and a new Sticker system that, on the surface, adds a new layer to combat and makes for rewarding exploration. Unfortunately, the lack of post-battle rewards like XP and absence of strong narrative hooks undermines its innovations. Nevertheless, Sticker Star maintains the beloved Paper Mario charm that makes the series so compelling.</p><p><em>Read our </em><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/paper-mario-sticker-star-review/1900-6399831/"><em>Paper Mario: Sticker Star review.</em></a></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Paper-Mario-Sticker-Star-Nintendo-3DS/dp/B0053BCMAC?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20">See at Amazon</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>12.

While this results in some fun twists in the combat and level design, none of these crossover elements are used to their full potential and the narrative and writing feel uninspired compared to Alpha Dream's previous entries in the Mario &amp; Luigi series.</p><p><em>Read our </em><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mario-and-luigi-paper-jam-review/1900-6416344/"><em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Paper Jam review</em></a></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mario-Luigi-Paper-Jam-Nintendo-3DS/dp/B0171RL3RS?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20">See at Amazon</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>11.

The large-scale environments are fun to explore, and the game's creative art style--naturally inspired by origami papercraft--is a joy to look at. The Origami King also reintegrates <em>some </em>of the RPG systems missing from other Paper Mario titles, including post-battle rewards that offer a smattering of progression to chase after. However, the battles themselves take a more puzzle-like approach that, while fun for a while, lacks the longevity of a more traditional RPG combat system.</p><p><em>Read our </em><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/paper-mario-the-origami-king-review/1900-6417506/"><em>Paper: Mario The Origami King review</em></a></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Paper-Mario-Origami-King-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B088MYGMP?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20">See at Amazon</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>10.

The other characters in Mario's party--including Luigi, Peach, and Bowser--have their own unique powers that aid them in the game's light platforming sections and real-time combat. These new ideas work well with the Paper Mario aesthetic, and though it's less of an RPG than some fans prefer, it's still an excellent entry in the franchise.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Read our </em><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/super-paper-mario-review/1900-6168805/"><em>Super Paper Mario review</em></a></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Super-Paper-Mario-Nintendo-Wii/dp/B000NNDN1M?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20">See at Amazon</a> </div></div><p dir="ltr"> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>8.

This dual-team approach extends to the puzzles and combat as well, with certain actions in one timeline affecting the other. If there's one place Partners in Time struggles, it's the writing; its main questline feels flat compared to other Mario &amp; Luigi games.

<p dir="ltr">In making its case for its Activision Blizzard acquisition to be approved, Microsoft has repeatedly said it will continue releasing Call of Duty on PlayStation.

I think as we've seen, even in preparation for this, that gamers are an active and vocal group," Spencer said.

The crew members attribute the franticness to Lord's management style and his preference for editing fully rendered work instead of conceptualizing in the early planning stages.</p><p dir="ltr">The delays reportedly resulted in crew members working over 11 hours a day, seven days a week, for more than a year to catch up. They were pushed back to the drawing board multiple times, leading to demoralization and an overall negative impact on morale. The crew members also express frustration over the lack of commitment to ideas and the constant need for revisions, which resulted in wasted work and increased stress.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/crew-alleges-grueling-production-of-spider-man-across-the-spider-verse/1100-6515458/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Friday night's alright for fighting, and if you're looking to stock up on some new Exotic gear before you head out to battle strange cosmic forces, then Xur has your back.

Here's where Xur is this weekend and what he has for sale.</p><p>This week you can find Xur in <strong>the EDZ</strong>, in the <strong>Winding Cove</strong> area. For his weapon, Xur is offering <strong>Jade Rabbit</strong>. Hunters can pick up the <strong>Wormhusk Crown </strong>helmet; Titans can grab <strong>Heart of Inmost Light </strong>chest armor; and Warlocks can buy the <strong>Phoenix Protocol </strong>armor.</p><h2>Xur Location</h2><figure style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4157015-xuredz.jpg"><img alt="Xur's location in the EDZ." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4157015-xuredz.jpg" /></a><figcaption>Xur's location in the EDZ.</figcaption></figure><p>Spawn in at the Winding Cove transmat zone, then hop on your sparrow and go north.

## Despite E3 Cancellation Reports, ESA Says No Decision Has Been Made

<p>Despite <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-is-canceled/1100-6512853/">multiple cancellations</a> leading to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1270ica/whatever_happened_to_e3/">widespread speculation</a> that the E3 games conference may be gone for good, the Entertainment Software Association, which has traditionally organized the event, begs to differ. According to the association behind the event, nothing is set in stone, and there may be hope for E3's future. Notes from a recent Los Angeles City Tourism Board tell a different story, <a href="https://tourism.lacity.gov/sites/g/files/wph1946/files/2023-06/06-21-23%20CTD%20Commission%20Meeting%20Packet.pdf">listing convention cancellations for both E3 2024 and 2025</a>--though it doesn't outright say the entire expo is canceled.</p><p dir="ltr">When reached for comment regarding the cancellations, an ESA spokesperson said, "ESA is currently having conversations about E3 2024 and beyond, and no final decisions about the event have been made at this time."</p><p dir="ltr">Once a staple of the gaming industry, E3 was canceled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was canceled in 2021 for the same reason, then again in 2022, but hopes for E3 2023 were high until it, too, was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/e3-2023-cancelation-explained-gamespot-news/2300-6461039/">canceled last March</a>. Some have pointed the finger at other gaming showcases, like Geoff Keighley's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-2023-the-biggest-games-announcements/2900-4769/">Summer Game Fest</a> (though <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-killed-e3-says-summer-game-fests-geoff-keighley/1100-6514794/">Keighly places the blame for E3's "death"</a> squarely on the ESA's shoulders). Additionally, other industry titans like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-showcase-may-2023-the-biggest-games-and-announcements/1100-6514540/">Sony</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-and-starfield-direct-the-biggest-announcements/2900-4772/">Microsoft</a> have taken a page out of Nintendo's book, opting to create their own exclusive showcases similar to the Nintendo Direct showcase, which first debuted in 2011.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/despite-e3-cancellation-reports-esa-says-no-decision-has-been-made/1100-6515455/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Sometimes the most enjoyable first-person shooter games are the ones that focus purely on the action in front of you, and Trepang2, published by Team17, looks like it might just be one of those games. Fresh out of the FPS oven, Trepang2 is currently on sale over at Fanatical, and you can <span class="norewrite">           <a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-100770772-13797872?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/trepang-2">snag a Steam code</a> </span> at a 19% discount, which slashes price to just $24.29.

As an amnesiac ass-kicker who has been broken out of captivity by a mysterious group, you'll need to use your superhuman combat abilities to escape the facility and fight back against your would-be captors.</p><p>The only problem? While special forces operatives are challenging enough, other monsters are also lurking in the shadows and they're ready to give you a run for your money as you work your way to the top of the food chain. Fortunately, you can slow down time to dodge bullets, use cloaking to become invisible, and knock multiple enemies to the ground with your super-strength. Also, the game is <em>incredibly </em>bloody, so be prepared to punch, kick, and slide through rivers of human crimson.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-big-on-this-hot-new-steam-fps/1100-6515454/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

While every player will be anxiously awaiting their first legendary piece of gear or the right weapon for their build, you will find that most of the loot you receive is not worth keeping. In these cases, you can either sell that gear to earn extra gold or salvage it to get back crafting materials.</p><p>It's ultimately up to you whether or not you want to sell or salvage an item in Diablo 4. However, some players might simply be wondering how they can salvage an item in the first place. Below, you can find the answer to that question along with some other details about what it means to salvage a weapon or piece of armor in Diablo 4.</p><h2>Diablo 4 - How to salvage gear and weapons</h2><p>You are able to salvage most pieces of gear when you visit a Blacksmith.

Campbell praised Cavill's audition, commending his appearance and acting abilities--but at the time, the actor was considered too young for the role.</p><p dir="ltr">Campbell clarified that he did not favor Cavill--who was 22 at the time--over Craig during the audition process, explaining the democratic nature of the decision-making.</p><p dir="ltr">"The way they work with Bond, and it's pretty terrific, is when they decide on the actor and you audition--in our case, it was eight people--it’s very democratic," Campbell said. "You sit around a table, eight or nine of you…you go through the eight people and you put your hand up as you talk through each person and ultimately everybody has to be unanimous in their decision, if you see what I mean.”</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/henry-cavill-could-have-been-bond-if-not-for-daniel-craig/1100-6515448/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Sonic Superstars is heading to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC this fall. Though preorders for the physical edition aren't live just yet, we now know that it will contain a very cool preorder bonus. Best Buy was briefly offering preorders, but the listing was taken down. We'd expect <span class="norewrite">           <a href="https://shop-links.co/1811903174266884798?u1=subid_value">Sonic Superstars preorders</a> </span> to start for real soon. Bookmark this page and check back, as we'll be updating this preorder guide as soon as listings go live.</p><p>Sonic Superstars might look like a remake (thanks to its gorgeous 2D graphics), but it’s actually an entirely new adventure. That means you’re getting a whole new set of maps to conquer, along with a fresh story to unravel--though it still revolves around Sonic and his gang of pals stopping the evil plans of Dr. Eggman.</p><p>Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy Rose are all playable characters in Sonic Superstars. A new mechanic also allows you to harness Emerald powers to maneuver and attack in unique ways. And if you’d rather not explore solo, the game will support four-player co-op.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-superstars-has-some-very-cool-preorder-bonuses/1100-6515438/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Still, there was a bigger secret that's now just being discovered: There are actually different versions of the film.</p><p>There are a few scenes that have different versions, and slightly changed dialog. One is Oscar Isaac's Spider-Man 2099 interacting with his assistant Lyla. In one, she points at Miguel; in the other, she takes a selfie with a bunny filter. Another is with the Spot's flashback before he uses his collider and some dialog changes.

After tweeting a comparison between the two images, the official Destiny 2 account acknowledged the "mix-up", saying they would be reaching out to the artist to offer credit and compensation.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">We've discovered that an external vendor that helped to create this cutscene mistakenly used this art as a reference, assuming it was official Bungie art.<br /><br />We have reached out to the artist to apologize for the mix-up and to credit and compensate them for their awesome work. <a href="https://t.co/Sqkg5tRHKj">https://t.co/Sqkg5tRHKj</a></p>  — Destiny 2 Team (@Destiny2Team) <a href="https://twitter.com/Destiny2Team/status/1671927000498597888?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">June 22, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The Bungie tweet explains that "an external vendor that helped to create this cutscene mistakenly used this art as a reference, assuming it was official Bungie art."
