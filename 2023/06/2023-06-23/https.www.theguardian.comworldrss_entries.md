<p>Tianjin reports all-time record of 41.4C, while Texas and Mexico break numerous temperature records</p><p>Parts of north-east China are in the grip of a historic heatwave, with hundreds of weather stations reporting record highs for the month of June. On 22 June the capital Beijing observed a temperature of 41.1C, a record high for the month, and the first time a temperature higher than 40C has been observed since 2014. On the same date, the city of Tianjin reported a temperature of 41.4C, a new all-time record for any month. Additionally, Dagang had its hottest day on record, with a temperature of 41.8C.</p><p>The national weather bureau in China issued an alert for heatstroke last week, almost two weeks earlier than is typical from previous years. Authorities have advised people to suspend outdoor work during the middle part of the day, when the temperatures are at their highest. The high temperatures have also lead to increased pressure on the power grid, with a more than 20% increase in demand reported in Tianjin on 15 June compared with last year. Temperatures in north-east China will remain on the extreme side over the coming week, with highs of 40-42C forecast each day in places. The all-time Beijing temperature of 41.9C could be seriously under threat.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/23/weather-tracker-china-issues-heatstroke-alert-amid-historic-heatwave">Continue reading...</a>
