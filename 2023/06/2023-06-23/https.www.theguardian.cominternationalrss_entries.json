Young Munia is strung from a tree because she has witnessed the killing of a woman, and the man who finds her body \u2013 homeless, mentally fragile and a Muslim \u2013 is considered by the villagers to be the culprit.

Even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/22/leave-voters-brexit-success-poll\">leave voters don\u2019t believe it has been a success</a>, and this morning the <strong>Tony Blair Institute</strong> has published <a href=\"https://www.institute.global/insights/geopolitics-and-security/moving-forward-path-to-better-post-brexit-relationship-between-uk-eu\">a report </a>that includes polling suggesting that four out of five people (78%) now want a closer relationship with the EU. Even amongst leave voters, 71% now favour a closer relationship with the EU.</p><p>The poll also suggests that 56% of people want the UK to at least rejoin the single market (with 43% favouring rejoining the EU in full, and 13% favouring just returning to the single market).</p><p>Our polling shows that there is a large majority of the British public who recognise that Brexit in its current form isn\u2019t working and would like to see the UK moving closer to the EU. This creates a substantial political space to move the debate forward from refighting the old battles about whether Brexit was right or wrong, to discussing what an improved future relationship with the EU should look like. <br /><br />The EU will always remain a key strategic ally, and it is absurd that the bloc has deeper trading arrangements with Israel and Georgia, better regulatory recognition on food-safety standards with Canada and New Zealand, and deeper mechanisms for political co-operation with nations including Australia and Japan.</p><p>Any future British government that wants to improve the relationship with the EU will need a carefully considered strategic plan \u2013 and make a clear-eyed offer to the other side. Asking the EU nicely cannot succeed as a negotiating strategy.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/jun/23/brexit-anniversary-poll-eu-rishi-sunak-jeremy-hunt-inflation-mortgages-uk-politics-live\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/jun/23/brexit-anniversary-poll-eu-rishi-sunak-jeremy-hunt-inflation-mortgages-uk-politics-live", "date_published": "2023-06-23 08:36:52+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "Twitter agrees to comply with tough EU disinformation laws", "description": "<p>Bloc officials enter company\u2019s headquarters to test its controls on issues such as Russian propaganda</p><p>Twitter has agreed to comply with tough new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/dec/17/digital-services-act-inside-the-eus-ambitious-bid-to-clean-up-social-media\">EU laws on fake news</a>, Russian propaganda and online crime after a team of officials from the European Commission entered its headquarters to stress test its capacity to operate legally in Europe.</p><p>It comes weeks after Elon Musk, Twitter\u2019s owner, quit the bloc\u2019s voluntary code of practice on disinformation.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/23/twitter-agrees-to-comply-with-tough-eu-disinformation-laws\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/23/twitter-agrees-to-comply-with-tough-eu-disinformation-laws", "date_published": "2023-06-23 08:23:51+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "Football transfer rumours: Liverpool\u2019s Mohamed Salah off to Saudi Arabia?", "description": "<p>Today\u2019s fluff is firing on all cylinders</p><p>Before the end of the window every single top-flight footballer from Newcastle to Naples will be linked with a move to the charming Saudi Pro League.
