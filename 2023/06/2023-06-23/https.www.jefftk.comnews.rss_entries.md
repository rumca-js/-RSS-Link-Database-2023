The park closest to our house has a lot of "park toys".  These are
toys that people brought to the park for everyone to play with.
They're usually somewhat broken when they show up, and eventually get
thrown out when they're so broken that there's not much interesting to
do with them anymore (which is hard!)  This isn't something I
experienced growing up, and I see more of it this park than other
parks in the area.  Walking around the park today, here's the current
assortment.

<p>

</p>

<p>

A fire truck.  It used to have a ladder, but that fell off a couple
weeks ago:

</p>

</p>

<p>

A smaller fire truck.  Also used to have a ladder.  I think it used to
have doors too:

</p>

</p>

<p>

A very small bike.  Julia pumped the tires up a few weeks ago.
Probably the nicest toy here?  Mildly surprised no one has wandered
off with it:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>

Some sort of standing trike?  Maybe for teaching someone the leg
motions before they're ready for a balance bike?

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>

A Minnie Mouse themed riding airplane.  Missing a wing and part of the
flight controls.  Nora still loves riding it, though!

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>

A basketball that won't stay inflated (we've tried):

</p>

<p>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/park-toy-basketball-big.jpg"><img class="mobile-fullwidth" height="321" src="https://www.jefftk.com/park-toy-basketball.jpg" width="550" /><div class="image-vertical-spacer"></div></a>

</p>

<p>

A tricycle.  It's designed to have the option for an adult to push it,
and the pedals freewheel when you're going faster than you're
pedaling.  The handlebars are loose and older kids like turning them
around so it's a reverse-only trike, but today it's in its designed
forward-only configuration:

</p>

<p>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/park-toy-trike-big.jpg"><img class="mobile-fullwidth" height="386" src="https://www.jefftk.com/park-toy-trike.jpg" width="550" /><div class="image-vertical-spacer"></div></a>

</p>

<p>

A digger.  I think this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loader_(equipment)">front-end
loader</a>, or at least it was before it lost its bucket:

</p>

<p>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/park-toy-front-end-loader-big.jpg"><img class="mobile-fullwidth" height="345" src="https://www.jefftk.com/park-toy-front-end-loader.jpg" width="550" /><div class="image-vertical-spacer"></div></a>

</p>

<p>

A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haul_truck">haul truck</a>:

</p>

<p>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/park-toy-dump-truck-big.jpg"><img class="mobile-fullwidth" height="294" src="https://www.jefftk.com/park-toy-dump-truck.jpg" width="550" /><div class="image-vertical-spacer"></div></a>

</p>

<p>

Another haul truck, with better build quality.  Currently transporting
fake icecream:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>

Less sure about this one.  Maybe a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skid-steer_loader">skid-steer</a>?

</p>

<p>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/park-toy-potential-skid-steer-big.jpg"><img class="mobile-fullwidth" height="387" src="https://www.jefftk.com/park-toy-potential-skid-steer.jpg" width="550" /><div class="image-vertical-spacer"></div></a>

</p>

<p>

A car.  The front wheels are clearly the least sturdy component.  At
one point Lily <a href="https://www.lilywise.com/fixing-a-tire">had a
go at fixing one of them</a>.  Since then it broke again, someone
replaced them, and it broke again.  Bonus: a ladder from one of the
fire trucks in the background:

</p>

<p>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/park-toy-car-big.jpg"><img class="mobile-fullwidth" height="496" src="https://www.jefftk.com/park-toy-car.jpg" width="550" /><div class="image-vertical-spacer"></div></a>

</p>

<p>

These all get a lot of use, and I'm really glad we have a culture of
people bringing their old toys to the park!
