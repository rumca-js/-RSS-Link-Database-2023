Not in real America, but in the progressive cities where voters keep voting for the same pro-crime progressive policies and wonder why there is so much crime in their progressive cities. Stores have <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/san-francisco-target-lockdown-merch\" target=\"_blank\">been forced to put everything behind plexiglass</a>, so shoplifter-Americans need to step up their game.

Why would they stop him from destroying private property? </p><p>The worst-case scenario is the fire gets out of control and he accidentally burns the building down. But then the thief can claim he was having a mostly peaceful protest and every elected official in NYC will look the other way.

When a Schmfizer director was caught saying the company was considering mutating SCHMOVID viruses to create a new schmaccine, he told James during his exit interview \"<a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/big-pharma-director-bananas\" target=\"_blank\">I am literally a liar.</a>\"</p><p>Don't get me wrong. I understand lying to a girl to get in her pants. Believe me. I understand.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"78f25\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=34166114&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>It's one thing to say you're a war hero or that you can get tickets to Taylor Swift's \"Era's Tour.\" Saying you are a cartoon supervillain who enjoys profiting off of war and using tragedy to control people's lives is a very niche story to tell. It tells me one of two things. The first is that you think the girl has a weird G.I.Joe fetish and has always wanted to roleplay she's the Baroness and you're Destro. Or, you have a fetish where you're the Baroness and she's Destro. It's 2023. I don't judge.</p><p>OR, you are NOT lying. This is what you and your colleagues really think. And because you are surrounded by people who think and do these things, your view of reality is warped, and assume everyone else is a scumbag like you are.</p><p>My gut tells me Serge falls into the later group. Knowing O'Keefe, we're going to find out Serge's peers are no different.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.
