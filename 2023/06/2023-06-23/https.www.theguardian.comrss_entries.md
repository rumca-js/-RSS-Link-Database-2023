<p><strong>Pyramid stage</strong><br />A vast crowd have got wise to the secret – the band were billed as ‘the Churnups’ – and are greeted with a set that shows Foo Fighters have recaptured their very essence</p><p>It’s one of the cruel rules of love and attraction that the more you try to impress someone, the less you’ll succeed; no-one likes a try-hard. And so it proves with rock’n’roll: heavily produced, overthought and desperate to please bands just don’t resonate like the ones who are doing it to please themselves. After a few albums on which Foo Fighters have felt like they were trying too hard to do the thing they once did so naturally – rock out – this secret set at Glastonbury, loosened of expectation, sees them finally relax back into what made them great.</p><p>They were billed as the Churnups, but this audience has clearly cracked the code: it’s one of the biggest crowds ever seen on this field, stretching back to verdant turf once staked out by the Rolling Stones, Chemical Brothers and (improbably) the Levellers in the annals of Pyramid big-hitters. “We’re not good at secrets,” smiles Dave Grohl at one point.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/23/foo-fighters-secret-glastonbury-set-churnups">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The former Rayo Vallecano manager showed in Spain his teams can punch above their weight with a relentless attacking approach</p><p>One day during the many months that Bournemouth spent analysing the man who would eventually <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/19/bournemouth-sack-gary-oneil-as-manager-in-clubs-best-interests" title="">become their coach</a>, they saw his Rayo Vallecano team run through a routine that looked familiar. If at first they could not quite put their finger on why, when they got the chance to ask him about it, everything fell into place. Yes, Andoni Iraola told them, it’s one of Eddie Howe’s. Iraola, described as a “sponge” by his former coach Joaquín Caparrós, soaking up everything he saw and heard, had learned from the Englishman, just as he had from Marcelo Bielsa, Ernesto Valverde and Patrick Vieira. From everyone.</p><p>Howe had learned from him, too, a lot shared. Howe, a frequent visitor to Spain, travelled to Madrid shortly before becoming Newcastle manager to see Atlético and Rayo. Rayo lack the basic resources elite teams consider standard, but there was good reason to go. He watched Iraola train, spent time with him and returned even more impressed. Analysts and sporting directors came from England’s big clubs, too, a quiet chatter commencing; something was happening over there, a coach emerging who was different.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/23/andoni-iraola-bournemouth-tactics-rayo-vallecano">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The anniversary is a cause for celebration, but events past and present mean there is anger and bitterness too</p><p>It should have been a week of sheer festivity, to mark the contributions to life in Britain of people from the Caribbean. Seventy-five years after the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/22/britain-windrush-75-pioneers-country-achievement" title="">HMT Empire Windrush</a> docked in Essex, there is much for their descendants and communities to be proud of. Interviewed in advance of Thursday’s anniversary, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2023/jun/20/i-did-it-my-way-alford-gardner-on-his-life-after-boarding-the-windrush-video" title="">Alford Gardner</a>, one of the few remaining survivors of the hundreds who boarded the ship in the Caribbean in 1948, said he “wouldn’t change a damn thing” about his life. Having served with the RAF in the second world war, he left Jamaica aged 22, got married in Leeds and had eight children.</p><p>Because 75 is a special anniversary – the National Health Service will reach the same milestone next month – and thanks to dedicated funding for projects celebrating the Windrush generation, there will be a slew of commemorative events this summer. One of these, in Wolverhampton, will explore the entwined histories of the health service and the Caribbean migrants who worked for it. But National Windrush Day, as 22 June has been officially known since 2018, is a day of mixed emotions for many of those whose <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2023/jun/21/the-children-of-windrush-they-told-us-youre-people-of-the-world-thats-what-matters-not-skin-colour" title="">life stories</a> it recognises. Pleasure in being the focus of attention, and in the fact that immigration is for once being celebrated, is mixed with bitterness at what it took to get this date on the national calendar.</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Not the way they would want, revered as the founding fathers of Brexit, toasted on this day every year as the men who led us to glorious independence from the hated empire of Brussels.

Farage and Redwood, along with Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, Jacob Rees-Mogg and the rest, promised increased prosperity, cheaper food, flourishing trade and a flush NHS. They said we’d be free of all that tedious European red tape and would take back control of our borders, encouraging anyone agitated by immigration to believe that fewer people would come in.

<p>The jostling for headspace speaks to the tribal nature of hats</p><p>When the England test captain, Ben Stokes, wore a bucket hat with the Three Lions crest embroidered on the front at the first day of the men’s Ashes last week, it brought almost as much attention as the Test match itself. The hat, known as a titfer, cost £25. On Twitter, he became known as “Bucket Hat Ben”.</p><p>A few days later, the sight of Pharrell Williams on the Pont Neuf over the Seine taking a bow after his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/21/pharrell-williams-paris-catwalk-louis-vuitton-menswear-debut">debut collection for Louis Vuitton</a> in a snug-fitting baseball cap, was a stark contrast.

<p>The late actor has a small role alongside Rita Ora in a long-delayed fantasy now limping to the screen with deservedly little fanfare</p><p>History has taught us to approach a great actor’s final screen role with a sense of cautious curiosity, to not expect the last word to necessarily be the best. Bette Davis, Joan Crawford, Elizabeth Taylor, Robin Williams and Gene Kelly have all bowed out with films that it would be kindest to forget or at least not use them as any form of defining statement on careers that have usually and understandably peaked years prior. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/dec/27/carrie-fisher-dies-star-wars-princess-leia">The death of Carrie Fisher</a> in 2016 left behind an unfinished Star Wars trilogy and sadly denied her the integral role she was expected to play in 2019’s The Rise of Skywalker, her appearance in the film cobbled together from unreleased Force Awakens footage.</p><p>It remains a sad sting, given how rewarding it had been to see her even around the edges of the first two chapters but a thrill to have her back in front of the widest audience possible, a fittingly grand way to say goodbye to someone whose talents always felt larger than life. But what many of us didn’t know at the time and in the years since is that Fisher’s final role was actually of a far smaller scale in a film that has been stuck in limbo ever since, wrapped just four weeks before her death.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jun/23/wonderwell-review-carrie-fisher-final-film-rita-ora">Continue reading...</a>

He practises shuffling and cutting the deck, too. If he doesn’t do this for up to an hour every morning, he’ll be “in a mood” all day. He even takes his cards on holidays. “It’s the opposite of riding a bicycle – it’s a knife that I have to sharpen every day,” he says.</p><p>Milas is a professional magician, and, at 32, a bona fide sleight of hand expert.

From dusk to dawn and back again, everyone was drawn to the vast and glorious element that connects us to the rest of the world.</p><p>But then, amid the revelry, a solemn procession appeared. Two dozen festivalgoers carried a series of <a href="https://thephotographersgallery.org.uk/whats-on/gideon-mendel-fire-flood">blown-up photographs</a> into the sea. They were portraits by the artist Gideon Mendel of people, many of them from the global south, standing amid the floods that had overturned their lives.<strong> </strong>Suddenly, in the face of their fates, the sea seemed not so benign after all. It was a reminder that sea levels are rising around the world; and that here in the UK we face our own potential disaster – the drastic <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/19/marine-heatwave-uk-irish-coasts-threat-oysters-fish-high-temperatures">sudden warming</a> of the sea off Britain and Ireland.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/23/sudden-warming-britain-seas-wildfire-fragile-ecosystem">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Relearning meat as a corpse’: vegan author Amber Husain on the politics of loving animals and eating them

<p>She was a meat-eater who found vegetarianism annoying, until one moment transformed her view. Her new book looks at myths about our relationship with our food</p><p></p><p></p><p>When Amber Husain was 26, she was preparing a piece of chicken for a friend to eat and was overcome by an unfamiliar feeling. A lifelong meat-eater, suddenly she was disgusted by what was in front of her. “I was just handling it and it felt so weird and horrible,” she says. Living with her vegan partner, she had been cooking meat far less often but had not totally given it up, believing that to do so was “little more than a salve for the naively guilty consumer”. Looking at it now though she “felt really strange … It completely transformed what I was able to confront in terms of the political reality of where meat comes from.”</p><p>Husain says she realised at that moment that for all the meat she had consumed in her life, she had never really <em>seen</em> it. She was, now, “relearning meat as a corpse”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/23/amber-husain-meat-love-vegan-politics-of-eating-animals">Continue reading...</a>

## White wines to drink with a barbecue | Fiona Beckett on drinks

<p>Don’t be afraid to try bigger, more expansive whites that can handle the flavours of barbecued food – and, yes, that includes chardonnay</p><p>What sort of wine do you drink with a barbecue? A big, gutsy red would be most people’s answer, I suspect, especially if meat is involved. But need you? Must you? Sure, there are all kinds of rosé these days – with a grill, I prefer the more robust, Spanish styles to the pale, Provençal ones – but why not a white?</p><p>We get so fixated on the usual suspects, sauvignon blanc and pinot grigio among them, that it’s easy to forget that there are bigger, more expansive whites that can also handle the flavours of barbecued food. Top among them would be whites from the Rhône and elsewhere in southern France, especially those made from grenache blanc, roussanne, marsanne and viognier – or even those grapes on their own, viognier being the most common. They can have a savoury, almost earthy character, rather than a fruity one – although, that said, some do taste rather deliciously of peaches, so would be great with grilled chicken, say. South African winemakers make similar wines, such as the brilliantly priced Rhône blend from Aldi in today’s pick. I also like the smooth Leon Perdigal Lirac Blanc 2022 (12.5%), a less familiar white Rhône that is £11.99 (or £9.99 on mix-six) at Majestic; that would work really well with grilled vegetables, too.</p><p>For more by Fiona Beckett, go to <a href="https://fionabeckett.substack.com/">fionabeckett.substack.com</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/23/white-wines-with-barbecue-fiona-beckett">Continue reading...</a>

The performer, Déja J Bowens, takes a deep breath and readies herself for another take. “Action,” comes a call from behind the camera. And then, just as she opens her mouth … a fire alarm starts to wail. “Oh, don’t even,” says Bowens with a despairing laugh – as 40 people drop what they’re doing and troop off to stand in a side street.</p><p>This is the set of Champion, a landmark new BBC musical drama from award-winning author <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/23/candice-carty-williams-its-time-to-write-a-book-just-about-black-people">Candice Carty-Williams</a>.

<p>It’s an irresistible dystopian image, though one that seems as likely to come to pass as big tech regulating itself</p><p>Can anything make Mark Zuckerberg feel anything, unless it physically involves Mark Zuckerberg himself, perhaps being kicked in the head by choice? Or is emotion the Meta boss’s phantom limb, twitching semi-regularly as a reminder of what he hacked off back in his Harvard dorm room all those years ago, as he began the long journey toward behavioural-modification, misinformation-spreading and selling the lives of billions of users to advertisers?</p><p>Please: try to picture him feeling something. Conjure Zuckerberg’s face as he scrolls through content he is unwilling to remove from any of his platforms, the sort of horrors that could destroy the sanity of a <a href="https://time.com/6147458/facebook-africa-content-moderation-employee-treatment/">sweatshopped Kenyan moderator</a> inside of six weeks, but which merely have Zuck reaching ice-bloodedly for a free speech argument.

In the US, as in the UK, it feels like the only story in town. It also concerns a tiny number of rich individuals whose plight, when shared by those further down the pecking order, excites nothing like the same interest. As placement of the story swings wildly between titles, newsrooms appear in meltdown over how much of the public appetite in the stricken sub to indulge.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/23/digested-week-emma-brockes-public-reaction-to-submarine-billionaires-is-shaming">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Minerva, Chichester<br /></strong>Rakie Ayola is superb in a story about the exploitation of a Black female playwright by the great and the greedy of London’s theatreland </p><p>It’s quite a title. Adrienne Kennedy – now a belatedly revered American playwright – impulsively came to London in 1966, young son in tow. She met John Lennon and sort of premiered a play at Laurence Olivier’s National Theatre. A fairytale becomes a devastating sliver of a fable about artistic greed.</p><p>In this short 2008 play, Kennedy recounts the events to her son and co-author Adam. Portrayed by Jack Benjamin, he strums a quietly insistent guitar and asks few but telling questions. Mostly, we’re enraptured by the superb Rakie Ayola as Adrienne, describing how a casual idea to base a play on Lennon’s nonsense poems gathers momentum when she arrives in London.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/23/mom-how-did-you-meet-the-beatles-review-an-affecting-memoir-of-a-thwarted-playwright-minerva-chichester">Continue reading...</a>

## A year ago Roe v Wade was overturned. Grieve for the new America | Moira Donegan

<p>The supreme court’s decision has created a two-tiered class of US citizenship: one for men and one for women. It is a generational tragedy</p><p>That it has only been a year since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade and ended the federal right to an abortion feels absurd, almost impossible. How horribly and dramatically our country has changed since then. In a span of just 12 months, thousands of lives have been permanently changed – dreams dashed, intentions scuttled, childhoods abruptly ended, talents and potential suppressed, health risked, and the self-determination of pregnant women snatched from them by a body of unelected jurists who believe that their own sentiments are more important than those women’s dignity.</p><p>The decision unleashed atrocities and morbid perversions of medical ethics that have rapidly become routine. Women experiencing miscarriages now wait around in emergency rooms and parking lots, unable to receive treatment until they sicken to the point where sufficiently brutal health outcomes (life-ending or life-altering, depending on the state) become a certainty. Other women, and no small number of girls, now gestate and give birth to infants conceived by their rapists – their coaches, abusive boyfriends, acquaintances, priests, fathers. Still others are forced into torturously monstrous exercises in medical futility, their bodies commandeered and used by the state to birth babies without lungs or heads.</p><p>Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/23/roe-v-wade-overturned-abortion">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Chiefs ended Saracens’ stranglehold on competition to ensure a non-London club will finally get their hands on the trophy</p><p>History is the word that will define this Saturday’s Premier 15s final. Saracens’ stranglehold on the end-of-season showpiece since the tournament began in 2017 – winning three out of four league trophies and contesting every final – was ended by a try at the death of their semi-final against Exeter Chiefs. Now all that has to be decided is who will be the first non-London club to win the league: Exeter or Gloucester-Hartpury?<br /><br />The south west affair will be hosted at Kingsholm – temporarily renamed Queensholm by Gloucester for the final – and while some have criticised the choice of venue for its lack of neutrality, Exeter’s Kate Zackary believes her club’s fans will give Gloucester’s “a run for their money”.</p><p>“Our fans, they are electric. They have done an amazing job, flags waving, being loud and making us feel at home [when away],” Zackary says.<br /><br />Gloucester defeated Bristol Bears in their semi-final in another West Country derby, and their co-captain Natasha “Mo” Hunt says: “We are anticipating that we will have the majority of that crowd on our backs. I think it could have an impact but you want that. You want the crowd behind you, you want that atmosphere, for me that is the appetite we want to grow. That is why people turn up and want to go again. Bring it on. If Exeter wants to bring all their drums, we love it. For us it’s all about 15 people, four white lines and that rugby ball.”<br /><br />Hunt signed for Gloucester in December 2018 but is a lifelong fan of the club. It has always been her dream to play in front of a packed shed and Saturday may make it come true with the club reporting ticket sales that have already broken the attendance record for the league final which was set last year (3,238 attended in 2022). A record final crowd is what this match deserves with it promising to be a close encounter.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/23/exeter-gloucester-premier-15s-final-rugby-union">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Doorsteps, window boxes and balconies are just as much gardens as large, green plots with fences. We should embrace them </p><p>I remember the faded typewriter script of it: the stipulation, dating from 1963, that there should be no pots or plants on the balcony. It was on the lease of my old London flat. I’d spent 15 months sofa-surfing to get it, and at the final hurdle it transpired I couldn’t garden there after all. Rather than wait for the council’s permission to grow things, I moved my containers in anyway. A few months later my doormat was confiscated as a fire risk. I wondered whether my garden would be next.</p><p>Perhaps it was lockdown, but somewhere between the weakening of Southwark council’s resolve (or resources) and the determination of my neighbours, my block of flats ended up becoming more rather than less green. Over that strange spring of 2020, they installed planters and pansies, creepers and containers. Soon it was almost as green as the woodland surrounding it. I believe these remain intact from council purges, but a few miles east in Greenwich, residents of the Vanbrugh Park Estate are campaigning to save their pot-bound front gardens after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/23/council-gnomes-pot-plants-hanging-basket-communal-space" title="">the council began to dismantle them</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/23/our-cities-need-greening-up-so-why-are-some-councils-keen-to-ban-urban-plots">Continue reading...</a>

It wasn’t too sensationalist despite probably falling into the true crime category, and the presenter had clearly done her research.

<p>The American author on the mysteries of Ellen Raskin and learning to write in bed</p><p><strong>My earliest reading memory</strong><br />My maternal grandmother, a primary school teacher, taught me to read at a very early age. While I can’t recall learning to read, I remember that the earliest books I fell in love with were “readers” from her school classroom, before I was even old enough to attend school. Having easy and early access to books shaped my whole life.</p><p><strong>My favourite book growing up</strong><br /><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/16/gillian-flynn-book-inspired-gone-girl" title="">The Westing Game</a> by Ellen Raskin. I read it when I was around 10, and it was my first experience of a story that was also a mystery or a puzzle. It lit up my brain and delighted me no end.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/23/attica-locke-toni-morrisons-beloved-touched-my-soul">Continue reading...</a>

## Pleats, clean whites and piped edges – it’s game, set and match to tennis-core | Jess Cartner-Morley on fashion

<p>The sophistication of the sport’s attire is a surefire ace this summer, serving up class without snobbery</p><p>Apologies first of all to anyone who saw the word “tennis” in the headline and thought this was going to be a column about Andy Murray’s prospects at Wimbledon, because it isn’t. (Fingers crossed though.)<br /><br />I’m not here to talk tennis. I’m here to talk tennis-core. Knife-pleat skirts, visors, collared polo shirts. Snowy white, with flashes of deep green; neat dresses with socks and trainers; sweaters the colour of clotted cream draped over the shoulders. Tennis is just such a good look.<br /><br />It has a glittering trophy cabinet of fashion heritage. This is the sport that gave us classic Stan Smith Adidas trainers, and the polo shirt, invented by René Lacoste. Glamour and elegance infuse tennis on court and off. The grace and power of a player serving an ace or diving into the net for a volley has the elongated, elegant line of a fashion illustration by René Gruau.</p><p>A classic diamond bracelet has been known as a tennis bracelet since 1978, when Chris Evert’s broke mid-match during the US Open and stopped the game to pick up the stones. Spectators at tennis tournaments don’t dress as fans, as they do at most sports; they wear The Vampire’s Wife dresses or dapper tailoring. And in what other sport would the ballboys and girls be dressed in the ultimate leisure-lifestyle brand, Ralph Lauren, as they are at Wimbledon?<br /><br />Tennis is a character-driven drama played by people at the peak of physical fitness, and the gladiatorial nature of the contest is reflected – in the modern game – in increasingly individual looks. But while these tutus and sweatbands, jumpsuits and blazers have kept the fashion spotlight on tennis, it is the classic look, rather than the avant-garde updates, that fashion will always be in love with.<br /><br />And never more than now. In 2023, tennis-core is where athleisure is at. After two decades of streetwear dominating fashion, preppy style is making a comeback. What that means, at real-life-wardrobe level, is neat collared polo shirts instead of oversized football-style shirts; colour combinations that are discreet rather than garish; subtle, club-style logos rather than slogans and graphics.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jun/23/pleats-clean-whites-and-piped-edges-its-game-set-and-match-to-tennis-core">Continue reading...</a>

## Experience: I ate a $120,000 banana

<p>There was no alarm protecting the artwork – a banana taped to the wall – and nobody tried to stop me when I peeled it</p><p>I’d been to Seoul’s Leeum Museum of Art years ago, but last April<strong> </strong>was my first visit to see the artwork Comedian by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/maurizio-cattelan" title="">Maurizio Cattelan</a>, which is a banana duct-taped to a wall. It’s a work of conceptual art and comes with a certificate of authenticity giving precise diagrams and instructions for its correct display. It was famously sold for $120,000 at Art Basel Miami in 2019. The banana is changed every few days.</p><p>Entry to the gallery was free. There were a lot of visitors, and about 10 people were standing around Comedian. The atmosphere inside the museum was calm. Interestingly, when I got close to another artwork to see it more clearly an alarm sounded and the guards stopped me. But when I approached Comedian, there was no alarm.

<p>The complex layers beneath interpersonal relationships are closely observed in this moving debut of friendship, transitioning and first love</p><p>In the opening chapters of Nicola Dinan’s debut novel, Ming, an intelligent young playwright from Kuala Lumpur, is seen from the perspective of adorably awkward Tom. They fall for each other at a British university, where Ming presents as a fey boy with an air of self-possession. But the lovers wake in bedsheets drenched from night sweats, a side effect of the citalopram prescribed for Ming’s OCD. Ming’s mother, and lodestar, died six years ago.</p><p>Tom learns about Ming’s vulnerabilities in fragments – which is much how Tom discovers himself. Tom sports thick vintage jeans and a sweatshirt with an ornithological logo: “No, actually, I’m not super into birds.” He has cultivated a look that will make him appear as if he “didn’t care but cared enough”. Tom is, Ming points out, the son of “middle-class Camberwell gentrifiers who worship at the church of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/yotamottolenghi">Ottolenghi</a> and knitted alpaca cardigans”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/23/bellies-by-nicola-dinan-review-the-fizz-of-first-love">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The latest recipient of the Joan Wakelin bursary from the Royal Photographic Society, photojournalist Owen Harvey, looks at the complex culture of bullfighting in Spain – a fault line between political camps</p><p>Bullfighting is inextricably intertwined with Spanish tradition and history, so much so that in 2013 it was declared part of Spain’s cultural heritage by law. The sport is controversial, however, and opposition to bullfighting is on the increase within Spain. The socialist-led Spanish government excluded bullfighting from a youth culture voucher scheme introduced in 2022 by the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez. The scheme entitles young Spaniards turning 18 to receive €400 (£340) – 50% of which can be spent on cultural events such as exhibitions, plays and films. Earlier this year, the nation’s supreme court ruled that bullfighting should be included in the scheme, citing the 2013 legislation and adding that the “cultural, historical and artistic aspects” of the sport had legal validity.</p><p>Trainee bullfighters El Gali, Antonio Fernández Torres de Navarra and Manuel Petersen in Málaga bullring La Malagueta</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/23/we-could-lose-our-lives-at-any-time-young-matadors-in-malaga-a-photo-essay">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The French composer’s cantatas - mini operas in all but name – are being staged for the first time in the UK. They are among many forgotten works by women from past centuries. We’re missing out on amazing music, writes <strong>Toria Banks</strong></p><p>Most people would struggle to name more than a handful of operas written by women. And alongside a few contemporary names, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/19/suffragette-ethel-smyth-opera-the-wreckers">Ethel Smyth</a> would probably be the only composer to feature from over a century ago. And yet there are literally hundreds of surviving pre-20th century operas by women composers, including about 30 from before 1800, not to mention oratorios and dramatic cantatas that are often just as theatrical. Ditte Hammar of Swedish feminist opera company <a href="https://denandraoperan.se/">Den Andra Operan</a> told me that the first time someone handed her a list of operas by women she couldn’t believe it. “I couldn’t sleep! How can I have lived my whole life in the opera world and not have heard about this?” And really, that is the question.</p><p>Next week sees three UK premieres by a little-known composer. These works were not written last month, but 300 years ago and yet they have never been performed in the UK. They give voice to women whose stories – if told at all – have been told by male voices. They speak about courage, violence and endurance in music that is both beautiful and bold.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/23/out-of-her-mouth-cantatas-elisabeth-jacquet-de-la-guerre-dunedin-hera">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There is so much more to the country than Algarve sun. Our tipsters try coast walks and venture inland for river beaches, vistas and amazing villages</p><p><strong>Cabo d</strong><strong>a Roca</strong>, 12 miles west of Sintra, is a must-visit, but it was odd there so few people joining us on the well-laid-out coastal footpath. Walking from Cabo da Roca seven miles up the coast to the next town, Azenhas do Mar, was one of the best routes I’ve ever hiked. We dropped in on secluded and beautiful beaches via steep offshoots of the coast path. But everything it set up perfectly, with proper ropes alongside the footpath so that you can use it to safely climb up and down the hills. The beaches, including Praia da Ursa and Praia da Adraga, are just simply breathtaking. <br /><strong>Christina Tang</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/jun/23/readers-favourite-places-in-portugal-alentejo-algarve-inland">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There are 1,300 companies in the UK, including John Lewis, that give their members a stake in the organisation</p><p>Hospital consultants are the latest group of workers to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/16/nhs-providers-boss-health-service-abyss-if-consultants-strike">ballot for strike action</a>. In the past year, the UK has lost <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/19/union-leaders-vow-to-carry-on-fight-for-better-wages-and-working-conditions">3.7m working days to strikes</a>; largely public sector workers such as nurses, junior doctors and railway workers but private sector workers at the likes of Amazon and Heathrow too.<br /><br />The Office for National Statistic reckons that strikes have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/apr/13/uk-economy-february-public-sector-strikes">depressed growth in the economy</a>. People may have changed their spending behaviour or those with children may have been unable to work if teachers were on strike, for example. <br /><br />Perhaps this level of industrial strife is to be expected when inflation remains worryingly high – with the Bank of England raising interest rates <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/22/bank-of-england-raises-interest-rates-by-a-half-point-to-5">for the thirteenth time in a row to 5%</a> on Thursday – amid <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/20/uuk-workers-wage-stagnation-resolution-foundation-thinktank">wages that have been flatlining since 2008</a>.<br /><br />There are strong echoes of the 1970s when oil price shocks led to sky-high inflation. I grew up in the 1970s and 1980s and remember well the three-day week, electricity blackouts and teachers’ strikes. The last of these left me and my schoolmates learning at home for weeks at a time.<br /><br />Is there an alternative to industrial action? If workers felt they had more of a stake – or greater sense of ownership – in the business or the public service they were providing, there could be fewer disputes and more limited industrial action.<br /><br />Friday is employee ownership day, a chance to mark and celebrate businesses owned by their members, such as the John Lewis Partnership.<br /><br />Employee ownership has <a href="https://employeeownership.co.uk/resources/what-the-evidence-tells-us/">more than doubled</a> in the past three years. By the end of last year, there were 1,300 employee-owned businesses in the UK. They range from Arup, the design and engineering firm, to Zetter, the recruitment agency.<br /><br />The top-50 of them generated revenue of £21.7bn last year. Nine in 10 employee-owned businesses reported that employees have some or a lot of say in decisions on working conditions; 85% have some or a lot of say in new working methods.</p><p>Different employee-owned organisations have different ways of giving their members a stake; for the John Lewis Partnership, employees’ (or partners’<em>) </em>share in any profits that are made by the business. And as an industrial democracy, partners influence how the business is run through their elected representatives in local forums or partnership-wide council. Interestingly, there is no constitutional ban on trade unions, although – to date – none has been organised.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/23/why-more-employee-owned-businesses-could-mean-fewer-strikes-john-lewis-sharon-white">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Russia killed 136 children in Ukraine last year, says UN report; Kyiv accuses Moscow’s forces of hiding bodies in aftermath of Kakhovka dam breach </p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia+ukraine">See all our Russia-Ukraine war coverage</a></li></ul><p><strong>The United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, has called out Russia for killing 136 children in Ukraine</strong> in 2022 and added its armed forces to a global list of offenders, according to a report to the UN security council. The UN also verified that Russian armed forces and affiliated groups injured 518 children and carried out 480 attacks on schools and hospitals. The forces used 91 children as human shields, according to the report. Guterres was “particularly shocked” by the high number of child casualties, he said in the report, while also saying he was disturbed by the high number of offences against children by Ukrainian forces.</p><p><strong>Russia has formed special groups to collect and hide bodies of people killed in the aftermath of Kakhovka dam breach</strong> in southern Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. The Ukrainian president said in a video address on Thursday that the situation in Russian-occupied parts of the region was “catastrophic to put it mildly”.</p><p><strong>Ukraine’s prime minister has said its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jun/22/russia-ukraine-war-live-slow-pace-of-counteroffensive-setting-conditions-for-future-main-effort-usthinktank-says?page=with:block-6494338c8f08657ec7320967#block-6494338c8f08657ec7320967">counteroffensive will take time</a></strong> but he is optimistic about its success. Denys Shmyhal’s comments, on the sidelines of a Ukraine reconstruction conference in London on Thursday, came after Zelenskiy said the counteroffensive <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/21/volodymyr-zelenskiy-admits-ukrainian-counter-offensive-going-slower-than-desired">might be going “slower than desired”</a> but he would not needlessly risk soldiers’ lives to meet international expectations. Moscow had suggested there appeared to have been a break in the counteroffensive’s intensity.</p><p><strong>Foreign donors pledged €60bn of new financial support for Ukraine</strong>, the UK said, as the international conference in London aimed at funding the country’s reconstruction closed. The commitments from governments and international organisations targeted supporting Ukraine in the short- and medium-term, the British foreign minister, James Cleverly, said on Thursday.</p><p><strong>Russia fired cruise and ballistic missiles and strike drones</strong> at targets in Ukraine early on Thursday, causing damage in the cities of Odesa and Kryvyi Rih, Ukrainian officials said.</p><p><strong>Russian-backed officials in southern Ukraine have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/22/russia-accuses-ukraine-uk-missiles-strike-bridge-to-crimea">accused Kyiv of using British-supplied long-range missiles</a> to strike a bridge</strong> connecting Kherson province with the Crimean peninsula. A series of photos and videos circulating on Telegram on Thursday showed a large crater on the bridge, and debris littering the roads. There were no casualties reported.</p><p><strong>Ukraine and Moldova have made good progress on their journey to becoming members of the EU</strong>, a European commissioner has said. The EC reportedly made clear that Ukraine had a way to go to complete the seven steps the EU outlined last year when it granted Kyiv the status of a candidate for membership.</p><p><strong>Russia is 99.9% certain to quit a UN-brokered deal on the safe wartime passage of Black Sea grain</strong> in July as it no longer needs Ukrainian ports to export ammonia, a senior Ukrainian diplomat has said.</p><p><strong>Volodymyr Zelenskiy</strong> reportedly said Ukrainian spies believed Russia was plotting an incident to release radiation from the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia plant in southern Ukraine, Europe’s largest nuclear plant, an allegation denied by the Kremlin.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/23/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-485-of-the-invasion">Continue reading...</a>
