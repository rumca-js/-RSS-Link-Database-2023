  <p id="9t4i6x">Google’s new search feature that shows you different perspectives (ideally, human ones) in search results will be available on Friday, <a href="https://twitter.com/Google/status/1672319243390427166">the company said on Twitter</a>. The perspectives will show up in a tab called, well, “Perspectives.”</p>
<p id="iNdhH5">“Tap the filter, and you’ll exclusively see long- and short-form videos, images and written posts that people have shared on discussion boards, Q&amp;A sites and social media platforms,” Google wrote in a blog post about the feature <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/google-search-perspectives/?utm_source=tw&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=io23&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=">from May</a>. Based on a video in Google’s blog post, that includes things like TikTok videos, YouTube videos, websites, tweets, Quora results, and Reddit posts. My colleague David Pierce <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/10/23717685/google-perspectives-search-human-experiences-io-reddit">described the Perspectives results</a> as something that looks “more like Pinterest than a typical set of...</p>

  <p id="EXV1A8">Microsoft’s Xbox chief has revealed one of the key reasons behind the acquisition of Bethesda parent company ZeniMax: potential <em>Starfield </em>PlayStation exclusivity. Speaking at the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23768244/ftc-microsoft-activision-blizzard-case-news-announcements"><em>FTC v. Microsoft </em>hearing</a> today,  Phil Spencer revealed that Sony regularly pays competitors to “skip our platform” and Microsoft felt it needed to own Bethesda to compete.</p>
<p id="gUNGGB">“When we acquired ZeniMax one of the impetus for that is that Sony had done a deal for <em>Deathloop </em>and <em>Ghostwire</em>... to pay Bethesda to not ship those games on Xbox,” said Spencer. “So the discussion about <em>Starfield </em>when we heard that <em>Starfield </em>was potentially also going to end up skipping Xbox, we can’t be in a position as a third-place console where we fall further behind on our content...</p>

  <p id="7AmkWJ">Ask any coach, athlete, personal trainer, or doctor: sleep is an important, if not the most important, part of recovery. You cannot get those gains without regular, quality sleep. But life happens, and sometimes regular, high-quality sleep isn’t possible. In those instances, studies have found naps can be <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36690376/">an effective way to</a> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34559915/">boost your recovery</a> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34043185/">and athletic performance</a>. So, knowing this, somebody please explain why none of the Garmin smartwatches in my review closet will acknowledge my naps.</p>
<p id="VzH0a3">Miraculously, my occasional bouts of insomnia and Garmin training haven’t overlapped much. It makes sense. I never sleep better or more regularly than when I’m training for something. That streak ended these last few weeks when my insomnia came back...</p>
