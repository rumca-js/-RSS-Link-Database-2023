There’s apparently two versions of the Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse movie being shown in theaters. There was a side-by-side scene done by Twitter user Balisongs which featured #SpiderMan 2099 and Lyla, where in one version she takes a selfie and another where she points at Miguel. The Associate Editor for #AcrosstheSpiderVerse, Andrew Leviton, came out and confirmed that there are multiple versions of the movie currently airing in theaters. The Flash movie apparently ripped audio from YouTube for one of its cameos.  Cowboy Bebop’s 25th anniversary is approaching with something special, and so much more on today’s fix with Akeem Lawanson.

We don’t mean that in a bad way! Mortal Kombat 1 was one of the most talked-about games coming out of Summer Game Fest, which led to us discussing the long-running series’ place in the fighting game pantheon. It might not be as popular in the serious competitive scene, but it’s solid enough to sustain a decent community. On the single-player front, the campaigns are consistently entertaining to hook casual players, and there’s enough lore for die-hard fans to chew on. Really, Mortal Kombat casts a wide net (like Cyrax!) and consistently manages to hook players (like Scorpion!) so we’re happy Netherrealm has kept this series going strong.
