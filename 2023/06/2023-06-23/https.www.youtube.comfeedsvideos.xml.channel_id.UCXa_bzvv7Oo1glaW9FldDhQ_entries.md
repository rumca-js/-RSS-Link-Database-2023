Remedy Entertainment’s upcoming Alan Wake 2 is set to bring the beloved horror franchise back into the limelight, but there seems to be some obstructions. Between the disappointing sales of the original and the sequel’s story connections to the original game, Alan Wake 2 gets to target a small audience of players who adored the first game. 

Furthermore, its release date is sandwiched between heavy hitters in October. Of course, we really wish that Alan Wake 2 gets the love and appreciation it deserves - but Remedy has their work cut out.

Much has been said about Final Fantasy 16’s more mature tone and its action-focused combat in the lead up to its launch, and about whether, with such an emphasis being placed on those aspects, it’s deviating too far from the genre’s core identity. But make no mistake- this is an action game through and through. Not only that, this is also the most rich, complete, and cohesive rpg of this generation. 

Final Fantasy 16 is an absolute triumph, with ridiculously high highs that will stay with you forever. Though it stumbles a bit with its shallow RPG mechanics and its somewhat slow beginning, from its captivating story, and its fast and furious combat to its sheer sense of epic scale, its rich worldbuilding, and so much more, this is a game that exceeds all expectations in more ways than one.
