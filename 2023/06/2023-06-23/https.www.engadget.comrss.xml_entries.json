[{"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Moto Razr+ review: Finally some real competition for Samsung\u2019s Flip foldables", "description": "<p>Motorola clearly read reviews of Samsung\u2019s Z Flip series and took notes. The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/moto-razr-2023-hands-on-two-promising-foldable-updates-to-an-iconic-phone-specs-price-180043133.html\">Moto Razr+</a>, a foldable phone that\u2019s like a standard 6.9-inch handset when open, offers a large 3.6-inch screen when closed. That addresses one of the most common complaints about <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-4-review-camera-samples-specs-price-battery-life-170027529.html\">the Galaxy Z Flip 4</a> \u2014 the size of its Cover Display. It\u2019s a cramped 1.9-inch window with a limited selection of widgets that you can use. The Razr+, meanwhile, pretty much runs full Android with some tweaks. There\u2019s something about using the outer display that feels almost pager-like and sent me into nostalgic delight. The Moto Razr+, which goes on sale today for $999, might appeal to both old souls and early adopters alike.</p><h2>Design</h2><p>Currently in its fourth generation (if you count <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/motorola-razr-5g-snapdragon-765g-better-camera-foldable-1400-dollars-190049338.html\">the 5G model released in 2020</a> as a second-gen), the Razr+ has two notable differences from its predecessors. The first is the larger display. The second is something only people over 30 might notice: The Razr+ doesn\u2019t have a chin cupping the bottom like on the iconic original Razr. I don\u2019t mind it, but it does cost it some nostalgia points.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>When folded, there is no gap between the two halves of the main screen. It\u2019s a squat square, and its matte back reminds me of the case that my dad\u2019s pager sat in. Sadly, only the Viva Magenta model comes with a vegan leather back, while the blue and black models use Corning Gorilla Glass Victus on the front and rear. Our review unit is black, and the matte finish lends a more premium feel and helps fight smudges.</p><div id=\"fb20355d1b4141e49754c50b87f3cc50\"></div><p>The folded Razr+ is thinner than the Galaxy Z Flip 4 and fits comfortably in my palm, and it\u2019s slightly larger than the Samsung phone when open. The Razr+ has a slightly less rigid hinge than the Flip 4, too. The Samsung phone can hold itself up at pretty much any position, but Moto\u2019s hinge yields and opens all the way when you push it past 150 degrees.</p><p>Finally, at 188.5 grams (6.6 ounces), the Razr+ is lighter than <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/i-phone-14-plus-review-bigger-screen-better-battery-life-040056936.html\">the iPhone 14 Plus</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s23-review-a-solid-phone-thats-probably-not-worth-the-upgrade-173026346.html\">the Galaxy S23 Plus</a>, which both have slightly smaller screens. It\u2019s just a tad heavier than the Z Flip 4, though. Both Motorola and Samsung\u2019s devices are rated for water-resistance, with the Razr+ meeting IP52 standards while the Flip hit IPX8.</p><h2>External display</h2><p>Next to the Moto Razr+, using the Z Flip 4\u2019s Cover Display feels unusable, especially when trying to frame a selfie. Not only is there barely enough space to contain everything, but it\u2019s also hard to see. When shooting the video for this piece, our producer Joel Chokkattu struggled to get a usable shot of the camera preview on the Z Flip 4\u2019s exterior display in sunlight.</p><p>Motorola\u2019s larger pOLED panel also allows for a more full-fledged Android experience, while Samsung is a glorified notification widget. On the Moto, you can swipe down from top to see all your quick settings toggles and the brightness slider, swipe up slowly to show your open apps and switch between them, and swipe in from the side to go back. In comparison, the Z Flip 4 only lets you swipe sideways to rotate through widgets, and dragging down from top shows you just a single row of toggles.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt=\"The Motorola Razr+ folded shut and held in mid-air, with a weather widget showing on its external display.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/ed0f6fc0-11c7-11ee-a76d-2fa2f0e7aede\" style=\"height: 1333px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>The main difference between Moto\u2019s external display and the complete Android experience is the home screen. Motorola has designed it so that you can only have the clock widget, date, weather info and a row of six shortcut buttons. Tapping each of the latter takes you to the respective panel. You can also swipe sideways to see them sequentially, and you can arrange them in the order you prefer.</p><p>The widgets themselves are very similar to Samsung\u2019s offerings. You\u2019ll find an app launcher, dialer, calendar, games, media controls, steps tracker and the day\u2019s headlines. On the Moto, the latter two are supplied by Google services like Fit and News. Because the Razr+ has more real estate, it can display more information or use a larger font. Both of these are an obvious improvement over Samsung\u2019s teeny tiny panel, especially for those with bigger fingers, less dexterity or vision-related challenges.</p><p>The widgets aren\u2019t the scene stealers here. For the most part, they\u2019re simple \u2013 a calculator, media controls, et cetera. The Spotify playback widget doesn\u2019t do more than let you pause, skip tracks, rewind and change playlists, which is frustrating. But even the fact that it offers that last option is already better than the Z Flip 4.</p><p>You can\u2019t pick a specific song in a playlist, though. It\u2019s a mild annoyance and not a dealbreaker, especially since there are two viable alternatives here. One: I can just <em>open</em> the phone and use the main Spotify app to go to a different playlist and pick a song. Two \u2014 and this is where the Razr+ truly shines \u2014 any Android app can run on the outside screen, as long as you\u2019ve enabled it. This is a continuity feature so you can keep running whatever you\u2019re doing on the main display on the outside panel after you close the phone.</p><p>To use Spotify (or any other app) on the small screen, I\u2019d open it on the inside, shut the device, and continue outside. Even if I go on to do something else, I can find the app on the exterior display by swiping up from the bottom to see open apps.</p><p>You\u2019d think that there would be issues with apps breaking and elements either not showing or being blocked by the two cameras on the bottom right of the screen. But Motorola has some workarounds. You can either have apps take up the whole screen and the sensors block parts of it. Or you can swipe up and select a layout that forces the content to sit within a rectangle above the cameras similar to how Android phones used to treat camera notches.</p><p>This should work with any app, but there are some scenarios where the experience is broken. When you\u2019re navigating a drive with Google Maps and playing music at the same time, for example, you won\u2019t be able to see the directions or your route. And, just because you <em>can</em> see your Instagram feed on the 3.6-inch panel, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll want to.</p><figure><img alt=\"The Motorola Razr+ folded shut and held in mid-air, with a full QWERTY keyboard showing on its external display and a thumb hovering over the space bar.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/ed2038a0-11c7-11ee-bdfd-37af16f05a4c\" style=\"height: 1333px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>Even better, because the screen is so small (basically the size of the original iPhone), it\u2019s easy to use with one hand. You can pull up a full QWERTY keyboard to reply to messages, and I was able to reach the letter Q or A with my thumb stretching across from the right.</p><h2>Cameras</h2><p>One other advantage of a larger external screen is how much more useful it is as a viewfinder. Both Samsung and Motorola let you use the outside display to preview what you\u2019re shooting with the rear cameras, as well as show your subject what they look like. On the Z Flip 4, you can only see a portion of the scene and will have to guess where it will get cut off. With the Razr+, no guesswork is necessary \u2013 WYSIWYG.</p><p>Both phones offer similar gestures like holding up your palm to trigger a countdown till the photo is shot, so you can step away and take your picture when you\u2019re ready and posed. You can also have the foldables bent at 90 degrees and placed on a surface with the inside screen facing out, and the layout will change so the top half is your viewfinder and the bottom shows controls.</p><p>Unfortunately, on the Z Flip 4 you have to choose between a bigger viewfinder with an inferior 10-megapixel camera or a smaller window and better cameras. On the Razr+, you can use the roomy outside screen and the exterior cameras instead of having to sacrifice quality or visibility while shooting.</p><figure><img alt=\"Top down view of the Motorola Razr+ half folded and propped up on a surface with its internal  screen facing out. On the display is the camera interface, with the viewfinder on the top half showing a bronze pear and the bottom half is dedicated to controls like the shutter button and timers.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/ed169bb0-11c7-11ee-bfbf-d3b9c64e3a39\" style=\"height: 1333px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>Moto opted for a 32 MP sensor inside, with a 12 MP main camera and 13 MP wide-angle system. Initially, I thought the Razr+ delivered decent shots. But after comparing them to samples from the Z Flip 4 and a Pixel 7 Pro, Motorola\u2019s images are clearly washed out and less vivid. Samsung did a better job at exposure and retained the blue skies peeking through green leaves. In the same scene, the Razr+ blew out the sky. And when I snapped portraits of my friends\u2019 adorable dogs, it struggled to get a clear shot due to slower focus and overall lag.</p><p>The Moto also struggled in low light and was susceptible to lens flares in my nighttime cityscapes and selfies. Though the Flip 4 fared slightly better, overall flip-style foldables lag flagship phones when it comes to camera performance.</p><h2>As a regular phone: Main screen, performance and battery life</h2><p>Unlike most high-end Android phones released this year, the Moto Razr+ uses a year-old Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chip, which is the same processor inside the Z Flip 4. It\u2019s worth pointing out at this point that the Flip 4 is also nearly a year old and presumably about to be replaced by a newer model. So if having the absolute latest specs matters to you, you shouldn\u2019t even be considering the Razr+.</p><figure><img alt=\"The Motorola Razr+ half folded and propped up on a surface with its front screen facing out. On the display is a YouTube video mid-playback, with the red slider at the bottom and the play and skip buttons laid over the paused frame. There are buttons on the top right for settings and Chromecast as well.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/ed027770-11c7-11ee-bfd5-f21ba5f9a3a9\" style=\"height: 1333px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>If you\u2019re not picky about the exact generation of processor in your phone, you\u2019ll likely be satisfied with the Moto\u2019s performance. I played endless rounds of Solitaire, messaged friends, set up custom gestures, changed wallpapers and it never flinched. The few hiccups I did encounter, like not being able to hit the X button at the outermost corners of an ad in a game, had more to do with specific apps and bad design than horsepower.</p><p>Thanks to its 165Hz refresh rate and 1080p resolution, the Razr+\u2019s main OLED display is a solid canvas for activities like scrolling through Instagram and Reddit. Pictures and Stories I looked at were vibrant, and yes, there is still a bit of a crease where the screen folds, but it\u2019s negligible. It doesn\u2019t get in the way of actually interacting with apps or websites, and I mostly forgot it was even there.</p><p>When I needed to unlock the Razr+, it was as easy as using the fingerprint sensor embedded in the power button. Motorola also continues to offer nifty features that have been in its phones since the Moto X, like twisting your wrist or doing a chopping action while holding the handset to launch the camera or flashlight. It was also surprisingly easy to install the company\u2019s Ready For app to use the Razr+ on my PC. While I was initially put off by the amount of Moto-branded software, thankfully most of it was useful and didn\u2019t feel like bloatware.</p><p>Though the company promises three years of OS upgrades and four years of bi-monthly security patch updates, historically it <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/motorolas-endless-rehashes-will-only-make-it-less-relevant-153037005.html\"><ins>hasn\u2019t had the best track record on that front</ins></a>. And that\u2019s less than the four years of OS updates and five years for security releases that Samsung offers. That, together with Samsung\u2019s experience in foldables, gives me slightly more confidence in its devices\u2019 longevity.</p><figure><img alt=\"The Motorola Razr+ and the Galaxy Z Flip 4 side by side, both folded shut with their profiles facing the camera. The Samsung phone has a slight gap between the two halves of its interior display, near the hinge. The Motorola device is completely gapless.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/ed0adbe0-11c7-11ee-b93f-ce5acc13ce25\" style=\"height: 1333px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>Moto managed to squeeze a 3,800mAh battery in the Razr+, which is slightly higher than the Flip 4\u2019s 3,700 mAh setup. I haven\u2019t had the time to run our video rundown battery test, which I want to do on both the 6.9-inch and 3.6-inch panels. But I\u2019ve been able to play about five to eight hours of nonstop Solitaire on the internal screen so far before needing to plug the Razr+ in. It\u2019s also worth noting that since the exterior display is so much more useful, you can do more on the phone without having to tap the larger, more energy-intensive screen during the day. That way, the Moto actually manages to last longer than most phones.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>I am in love with that front screen \u2014 how it works, how easy it is to use with one hand, and how much more power efficient it is. It\u2019s almost like I want a small phone again. But the main thing preventing me from switching to the Moto Razr+ is camera performance. This isn\u2019t a problem unique to Motorola \u2014 any flip-style foldable today suffers from this.</p><p>Anyone thinking of getting the Razr+ should also wait. Samsung has announced that its next Galaxy Unpacked will be taking place in Korea in late July, and it\u2019s widely expected to launch new foldables then. If you can hold off, it\u2019s worth seeing what the next Z Flip will offer before spending your money.</p><figure><img alt=\"The Motorola Razr+ folded in half and propped up on its short edge with the two rear cameras at the bottom and the outside screen facing the camera. The Android Quick Settings shade, with a display brightness slider up top and a Spotify widget at the bottom, is on the display.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/ed3c2510-11c7-11ee-be7e-b28437f4caa5\" style=\"height: 1333px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>I also want to point out that long-term durability remains a concern for any device with a flexible screen. Two of my colleagues have used a Z Flip 4 for a year and they\u2019ve reported seeing cracks and bubbles in their displays and/or screen protectors. While the Razr+ uses a different panel from Samsung, there is still a possibility it won\u2019t stand up to the wear and tear of daily use.</p><p>I can\u2019t tell you how well the Moto Razr+ will hold up over time. But I can say that, for the first time in the US, there is serious competition for Samsung\u2019s Z Flip 4. It\u2019s time to call it: Flip Boi Summer is here and I\u2019m excited for it.</p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/moto-razr-review-finally-some-real-competition-for-samsungs-flip-foldables-203033514.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/moto-razr-review-finally-some-real-competition-for-samsungs-flip-foldables-203033514.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-23 20:30:33+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Fossil finally gets Google Assistant on its Wear OS 3 smartwatches", "description": "<p>Google Assistant vanished on many smartwatches when the Wear OS 3 update arrived, leaving just the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-watch-review-battery-life-fitbit-heart-rate-sensing-015412121.html\">Pixel Watch</a> and Samsung's newer <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-pro-review-battery-life-specs-durability-180052187.html\">Galaxy Watches</a> supporting the feature. Thankfully, you no longer have to switch brands just to talk to Google on your wrist. Fossil is rolling out an update this month that adds Assistant to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/fossil-gen-6-wellness-edition-smartwatch-wear-os-3-195859086.html\">Gen 6 watches</a> running Wear OS 3. This includes both Fossil's own models as well as counterparts from Diesel, Michael Kors and Skagen, although you'll need to be paired with a phone running standard Android with Google apps (Android Go and many Chinese phones won't count).</p><p>The functionality will be familiar if you've used either Google or Samsung wristwear. You can invoke the AI helper by saying &quot;hey Google,&quot; holding a button or tapping a watch face complication. The feature lets you answer texts, control music or otherwise handle tasks that would normally require your phone. Unlike many alternatives, though, you'll also have Alexa on hand. You won't be locked into one ecosystem for speaking commands.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>This won't be much help if you're using a Wear OS 3 watch from another brand, like Mobvoi or <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/montblanc-summit-3-smartwatch-wear-os-3-211209089.html\">Montblanc</a>. Fossil is one of the most popular names in Google-powered smartwatches, though. Support here ensures that many more wearable owners can use Assistant and avoid tapping a minuscule screen.</p><p>You might want to wait before purchasing if you're new to smartwatches. Fossil historically introduces new Wear OS models in late summer, with the exception being this year's mildly upgraded Gen 6 Wellness Edition in January. While there's no word on when Gen 7 will arrive or what it might entail, it's likely to be a significant upgrade if and when it appears \u2014 we wouldn't buy Gen 6 just because Assistant is ready. The update is more for existing owners who lost functionality last year.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/fossil-finally-gets-google-assistant-on-its-wear-os-3-smartwatches-194519611.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/fossil-finally-gets-google-assistant-on-its-wear-os-3-smartwatches-194519611.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-23 19:45:19+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "A Reddit transcription community will shut down over a 'lack of trust' in the platform", "description": "<p>A group of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/reddit/\"><ins>Reddit</ins></a> volunteers who transcribe media from other subreddits are shutting down their community, in part due to changes the company is making to its API.

A tree beyond the panes throws shadows across a plush rug, partially covered by an open cardboard box. The bedroom is compact and bright, and it\u2019s filled with the remnants of youth: books and family photos line the walls, and the desk drawers are stuffed with drawing paper and school supplies. A skateboard pokes out from under the bed and stuffed animals are tucked into the room\u2019s spare spaces. The record player spins soothing, lo-fi music, and you have a long, lazy afternoon to sit in this room, box up its memories, and move on.</p><p><em>Simpler Times</em> provides this peaceful environment and invites players to get lost in it. There\u2019s a story to unravel just by picking up objects, interacting with them and putting them away for good \u2014 the protagonist, Taina, is moving on from her childhood home, onto the next phase of her life, and her past and future come into focus as players explore her bedroom.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"fdb7903fd148487dbbec111a3e24a903\"></div><p>Even if <em>Simpler Times</em>\u2019 idyllic setting doesn\u2019t accurately reflect your own childhood bedroom, the developers at Transylvania studio stoneskip have designed a supremely comforting space. Everything about Taina\u2019s room feels welcoming and safe: safe to explore, safe to get lost in, safe to fall fully into your thoughts.</p><p><em>Simpler Times </em>is a first-person game with an emphasis on music and mood. The soundtrack is a series of original, lo-fi pieces that players control on the room\u2019s record player, in a ritual familiar to vinyl owners. Each album runs for a set amount of time before it has to be reset or swapped out: Move the needle to the side, lift the record and carefully put it away, and then reverse the process with a new album. It\u2019s a series of intentional actions designed to ground players in the moment, highlighting the beauty of anticipation and slow gestures. It\u2019s an effective sequence and emblematic of the game\u2019s pace overall.</p><figure><img alt=\"Simpler Times\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/a9cf4461-11e5-11ee-bfef-82170813a663\" style=\"height: 2160px; width: 3840px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">iam8bit</div></figure><p><em>Simpler Times</em>\u2019 soundtrack is composed by George Pandrea and it includes moments of lyrical poetry written and performed by Taina\u2019s voice actor, Maeve Kroeger. There are other static points of interaction around the bedroom, including an instant camera and a scrapbook that provides backstory and suggests areas to clean next, advancing the larger narrative. There is no fail state in <em>Simpler Times</em> and no clock on any action. Dialogue floats in and and out as players explore, the rolling music encouraging reflection as Taina\u2019s story passively unfolds.</p><p>On the surface,<em> Simpler Times</em> sounds similar to <em>Gone Home</em>, the original indie \u201cwalking simulator,\u201d but this comparison isn\u2019t quite accurate. For starters, there\u2019s no walking in <em>Simpler Times</em>; the bedroom is small and players navigate by looking around and clicking on points of interaction. The game itself was conceived during the pandemic, when developers found themselves trapped in small spaces, with ample time for self-reflection. <em>Simpler Times</em> is a contained, meditative game that actually feels closer to a calming, repetitive experience like <em>Threes </em>than a narrative adventure.</p><figure><img alt=\"Simpler Times\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/a9d02ec0-11e5-11ee-affb-970f3ae9b68e\" style=\"height: 2160px; width: 3840px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">iam8bit</div></figure><p>The full game takes place over four seasons, in four time periods of Taina\u2019s life, but the demo I played at Summer Game Fest was an introduction to her bedroom in present-day, just as she\u2019s starting to pack up. The demo left me relaxed and intrigued, and it was a welcome, cozy break from the chaos of a large (but not, like, E3-large) video game event.</p><p><em>Simpler Times</em> is being published by iam8bit and it\u2019s due to hit <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812210/Simpler_Times/\">Steam</a> in 2024.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/simpler-times-is-the-coziest-game-ive-played-in-a-long-time-173000140.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/simpler-times-is-the-coziest-game-ive-played-in-a-long-time-173000140.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-23 17:30:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "iFixit teardown reveals ASUS' ROG Ally is easier to pry open than the Steam Deck", "description": "<p>If the ease of repairs influences your choice in handheld gaming PCs, you might want to consider the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/asus-rog-ally-hands-on-possibly-the-most-powerful-handheld-gaming-pc-yet-140054506.html\">ROG Ally</a>. iFixit just finished a <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=89f68c82-f255-44fa-8db9-03fec996b93a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YouTube&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4OWY2OGM4Mi1mMjU1LTQ0ZmEtOGRiOS0wM2ZlYzk5NmI5M2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1JeFBnQmhtNnRIcyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNDg2M2MzNjctOGYxYS00ZmI2LTkzMWItZjFhYTI1Yjc0YjcwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAY3GtjhzFuAkmh9v7ronOpGxIeCY1Vff0xyVAR4y--EK&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DIxPgBhm6tHs\">teardown</a> of ASUS' machine, and it's noticeably easier to open than Valve's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/valve-steam-deck-teardown-ifixit-212520323.html\">Steam Deck</a>. For one, the battery is much less painful to remove \u2014 it mostly involves removing screws where Valve's power pack is glued in. It's also relatively trivial to remove the thumbsticks and their circuit boards on the Ally, so you might have a solution if <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-offers-unlimited-free-repairs-for-joy-con-drift-issue-in-europe-062645235.html\">stick drift</a> becomes a problem. As on the Steam Deck, SSD upgrades are simple if you find a sufficiently tiny drive.</p><p>The only truly repair-hostile component is the display, iFixit says. There's a lot of adhesive that could make removal difficult without the right tools. That's not a major issue if the entire screen breaks, but may be a hassle if you're trying to put a screen in a new cover.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"b6c357581f2e43c7a45a57ca926c86c9\"><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>There's one catch: ASUS hasn't committed to offering replacement parts for the ROG Ally. We've asked the company for comment. For now, at least, you'll have to source parts from other users willing to give up working components from otherwise broken devices. iFixit currently sells some official Steam Deck parts, such as screens, button assemblies and storage.</p><p>While teardowns indicate that the Steam Deck is easier to maintain than you'd expect, Valve <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/valve-steam-deck-teardown-211025030.html\">discouraged repairs</a> early on. It was concerned that merely opening the system created risks, and that third-party components could cause problems.

The Kids tablets have big rubbery cases built to withstand the abuse of a toddler, while the Kids Pro editions have slimmer hard-plastic cases designed for slightly older children.&nbsp;</p><h2>Amazon Echo Dot Kids</h2><p></p><p>Staying on the kid-friendly Amazon device train, the latest <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOUI5Q0QxWUI_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tMTRhLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3OTE3YzIyYS03ODg5LTRjMzItYTJkOS05NWFhY2RhMWQyMTEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfZucSHrboQ1uzYYjMHeVHd48-TEMyIveHvZgEjy5IjL&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB09B9CD1YB\">Amazon Echo Dot Kids</a> is on sale for $28. That's another all-time low and about $25 below the smart speaker's typical street price. Again, the offer is only available to Prime members. The Echo Dot Kids has the same impressive hardware as the standard model, which we consider the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-smart-speakers-151515264.html\">best small smart speaker</a> for most people. The main difference is its cutesy design: One model looks like a dragon, the other looks like an owl. Like the Kids devices above, it also comes with a two-year warranty and a year of Amazon Kids+. In this case, the latter supplies kid-friendly podcasts, playlists and audiobooks along with more education-focused Alexa skills. The quality of that content can be hit or miss, but it's all age-appropriate.</p><h2>Amazon Echo Show 5 Kids (3rd gen)</h2><p></p><p>If you subscribe to Prime, you can get two <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDlCMlNCNzdRP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTE0YS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNzkxN2MyMmEtNzg4OS00YzMyLWEyZDktOTVhYWNkYTFkMjExIn0&amp;signature=AQAAATItdvmLRWQ_Qosz5cz6LhvJJgLaOmjEqijQHFS6HHbO&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09B2SB77Q\">Echo Show 5 Kids</a> smart displays for $100 by adding them both to your cart and using the code <strong>SHOW5KIDS</strong> at checkout.

Like most other Amazon Kids devices, the Echo Show 5 Kids takes the same hardware as the \"normal\" variant and adds a more playful design, a longer warranty and easier access to kid-friendly content. The 5.5-inch device isn't as powerful as the larger <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDg0REM0TFc2Lz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby0xNGEtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijc5MTdjMjJhLTc4ODktNGMzMi1hMmQ5LTk1YWFjZGExZDIxMSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAATOpnXLLtroZwHZPre0PZtSDxQjSMPkOrA8-s5CXo2NS&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB084DC4LW6%2F\">Echo Show 8</a> for streaming or making video calls, but it makes for a nice smart alarm clock or bedside display if you regularly use Alexa. Of note, the device also comes with a physical camera shutter and mic mute button for when the kids aren't playing around.</p><h2>Amazon Echo Pop + Ring Video Doorbell</h2><p></p><p>A <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwQzVLMUZOUDIvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTE0YS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNzkxN2MyMmEtNzg4OS00YzMyLWEyZDktOTVhYWNkYTFkMjExIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAYUD4nc8ynCnu8AXaJMNN3enfcw0kC0LDDlxAIQ2PS2T&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0C5K1FNP2%2F\">bundle that pairs</a> Amazon's Echo Pop speaker with a wired Ring Video Doorbell is down to $40 for Prime members. The Pop <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazon-unveils-the-40-echo-pop-a-semi-spherical-smart-speaker-140026706.html\">is more or less</a> a cheaper version of the Echo Dot with a unidirectional design and less powerful audio quality, but it goes for $40 on its own, so this deal effectively nets you a video doorbell for no extra cost. The Ring doorbell here is decidedly entry-level, too, as it lacks local storage, won't work with existing chimes and requires <a href=\"https://support.ring.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001671383-General-Information-on-Ring-Protect-Subscription-Plans\">a subscription</a> to store and view recordings. Like other Ring devices, it also comes with its share of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nypd-joins-ring-neighbors-app-213032209.html\">privacy concerns</a>. But if you just want the basics for as little as possible, it captures 1080p video and is generally easy to set up and use.</p><p>If you don't care about the Echo Pop, the doorbell alone is <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDhDS0hQUDUyLz90aD0xJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTE0YS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNzkxN2MyMmEtNzg4OS00YzMyLWEyZDktOTVhYWNkYTFkMjExIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAUSjq6l44UzXcaOARsN8zK1DX6zGpdLc0DayCjz9J6xJ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08CKHPP52%2F%3Fth%3D1\">available for $35</a>, which is about $20 off its street price.

Normally, the subscription goes for $12 a month after a 30-day free trial. Just note that the membership will be set to auto-renew by default. As a refresher, Kindle Unlimited makes a selection of e-books, audiobooks and digital magazines accessible on-demand. It doesn't include every e-book in the Kindle library, but it may still be worthwhile if you're a particularly avid reader. If nothing else, this deal makes it easier to figure out if it's worth paying for.&nbsp;</p><h2>Audible Premium Plus 3-month membership</h2><p></p><p>Similar to that Kindle Unlimited offer, Prime members who are new to <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9oei9hdWRpYmxlL21scC9tZW1iZXJzaGlwL3ByZW1pdW1wbHVzL21vbnRobHkvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTE0YS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNzkxN2MyMmEtNzg4OS00YzMyLWEyZDktOTVhYWNkYTFkMjExIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAZpqgGCWvNcQw7ZFmuj-8XcFALCFtgJTwYa2OFHsZ9bU&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fhz%2Faudible%2Fmlp%2Fmembership%2Fpremiumplus%2Fmonthly%2F\">Audible Premium Plus</a> can get three months of the audiobook service for free. This membership usually costs $14.95 a month after a 30-day free trial, so you're saving about $30. Premium Plus is Audible's <a href=\"https://help.audible.com/s/article/what-is-included-in-audible-membership-plans?language=en_US\">upper tier</a>: Like the less expensive Audible Plus, it provides an assortment of audiobooks, podcasts and other audio content you can access on-demand. The main difference is that it also includes a monthly credit that you can use to buy any book in the Audible store permanently. As with Kindle Unlimited, Premium Plus will be most worth it if you burn through audiobooks and podcasts quickly, but this extended trial is a comfier way to see if it's useful.

You should see the full discount at checkout. Apple normally sells the device for $329, though we've seen it retail closer to $275 in recent months. This is the budget pick in <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-ipads-how-to-pick-the-best-apple-tablet-for-you-150054066.html\">our iPad buying guide</a>: It lacks the accessory support, thinner bezels and laminated display of the iPad Air, but it's by far the most affordable route into iPadOS, and it remains fast and comfortable enough for casual reading, streaming and gaming.

But if you just want a competent MacBook to do light work and web browsing for as little cash as possible, the M1 Air remains a solid value at this price. Its keyboard, trackpad and battery life are still excellent, and the M1 chip is still fast enough for the essentials.

A useless sentiment in its own right, but with the recent advent of code generating AIs, knowing the ins and outs of a programming language like Python could soon be about as useful as knowing how to fluently speak a dead language like Sanskrit. In fact, these genAIs are already helping professional software developers code faster and more effectively by handling much of the programming grunt work.</p><h2><strong>How coding works</strong></h2><p>Two of today\u2019s most widely distributed and written coding languages are Java and Python. The former almost single handedly revolutionized cross-platform operation when it was released in the mid-\u201990s and now drives \u201ceverything from smartcards to space vehicles,\u201d according to <a href=\"https://blogs.oracle.com/javamagazine/post/the-top-25-greatest-java-apps-ever-written\"><em>Java Magazine</em></a> in 2020 \u2014 not to mention Wikipedia\u2019s search function and all of Minecraft. The latter actually predates Java by a few years and serves as the code basis for many modern apps like Dropbox, Spotify and Instagram.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>They differ significantly in their operation in that Java needs to be compiled (having its human-readable code translated into computer-executable machine code) before it can run, while Python is an interpreted language which means that its human code is converted into machine code line-by-line as the program executes, enabling it to run without first being compiled. The interpretation method allows code to be more easily written for multiple platforms while compiled code tends to be focused to a specific processor type. Regardless of how they run, the actual code-writing process is nearly identical between the two: somebody has to sit down, crack open a text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and actually write out all those lines of instruction. And up until recently, that somebody typically was a human.</p><p>The \u201cclassical programming\u201d writing process of today isn\u2019t that different from the process those of ENIAC, with a software engineer taking a problem, breaking it down into a series of sub-problems, writing code to solve each of those sub-problems in order, and then repeatedly debugging and recompiling the code until it runs. \u201cAutomatic programming,\u201d on the other hand, removes the programmer by a degree of separation. Instead of a human writing each line of code individually, the person creates a high-level abstraction of the task for the computer to then generate low level code to address. This differs from \u201cinteractive\u201d programming, which allows you to code a program while it is already running.</p><p>Today\u2019s conversational AI coding systems, like what we see in Github\u2019s Copilot or OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, remove the programmer even further by hiding the coding process behind a veneer of natural language. The programmer tells the AI what they want programmed and how, and the machine can automatically generate the required code.</p><h2><strong>Building the tools to build the tools allowing any tool to build tools</strong></h2><p>Among the first of this new breed of conversational coding AIs was Codex, which was developed by OpenAI and released in late 2021. OpenAI had already implemented GPT-3 (precursor to GPT-3.5 that powers BingChat public) by this point, the large language model remarkably adept at mimicking human speech and writing after being trained on billions of words from the public web. The company then fine-tuned that model using 100-plus gigabytes of GitHub data to create Codex. It is capable of generating code in 12 different languages and can translate existing programs between them.</p><p>Codex is adept at generating small, simple or repeatable assets, like \u201ca big red button that briefly shakes the screen when clicked\u201d or regular functions like the email address validator on a Google Web Form. But no matter how prolific your prose, you won\u2019t be using it for complex projects like coding a server-side load balancing program \u2014 it\u2019s just too complicated an ask.</p><p>Google\u2019s DeepMind developed AlphaCode specifically to address such challenges. Like Codex, AlphaCode was first trained on multiple gigabytes of existing GitHub code archives, but was then fed thousands of coding challenges pulled from online programming competitions, like figuring out <a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/ai-learns-write-computer-code-stunning-advance\">how many binary strings with a given length don\u2019t contain consecutive zeroes</a>.</p><p>To do this, AlphaCode will generate as many as a million code candidates, then reject all but the top 1 percent to pass its test cases. The system will then group the remaining programs based on the similarity of their outputs and sequentially test them until it finds a candidate that successfully solves the given problem. Per a 2022 study published in <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abq1158\"><em>Science</em></a>, AlphaCode managed to correctly answer those challenge questions 34 percent of the time (compared to Codex\u2019s single-digit success on the same benchmarks, that\u2019s not bad). DeepMind even <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abq1158\">entered AlphaCode in a 5,000-competitor online programming contest</a>, where it surpassed nearly 46 percent of the human competitors.</p><h2><strong>Now even the AI has notes</strong></h2><p>Just as GPT-3.5 serves as a foundational model for ChatGPT, Codex serves as the basis for GitHub\u2019s Copilot AI. Trained on billions of lines of code assembled from the public web, Copilot offers cloud-based AI-assisted coding autocomplete features through a subscription plugin for the Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Neovim, and JetBrains integrated development environments (IDEs).</p><p>Initially released as a developer\u2019s preview in June of 2021, Copilot was among the very first coding capable AIs to reach the market. More than a million devs have leveraged the system in the two years since, GitHub's VP of Product Ryan J Salva, told Engadget during a recent interview. With Copilot, users can generate runnable code from natural language text inputs as well as autocomplete commonly repeated code sections and programming functions.</p><p>Salva notes that prior to Copilot\u2019s release, GitHub\u2019s previous machine-generated coding suggestions were only accepted by users 14 - 17 percent of the time, \u201cwhich is fine. It means it was helping developers along.\u201d In the two years since Copilot\u2019s debut, that figure has grown to 35 percent, \u201cand that's netting out to just under half of the amount of code being written [on GitHub] \u2014 46 percent by AI to be exact.\u201d</p><p>\u201c[It\u2019s] not a matter of just percentage of code written,\u201d Salva clarified. \u201cIt's really about the productivity, the focus, the satisfaction of the developers who are creating.\u201d</p><p>As with the outputs of natural language generators like ChatGPT, the code coming from Copilot is largely legible, but like any large language model trained on the open internet, GitHub made sure to incorporate additional safeguards against the system unintentionally producing exploitable code.</p><p>\u201cBetween when the model produces a suggestion and when that suggestion is presented to the developer,\u201d Salva said, \u201cwe at runtime perform \u2026 a code quality analysis for the developer, looking for common errors or vulnerabilities in the code like cross-site scripting or path injection.\u201d</p><p>That auditing step is meant to improve the quality of recommended code over time rather than monitor or police what the code might be used for. Copilot can help developers create the code that makes up malware, the system won\u2019t prevent it. \u201cWe've taken the position that Copilot is there as a tool to help developers produce code,\u201d Salva said, pointing to the numerous White Hat applications for such a system. \u201cPutting a tool like Copilot in their hands \u2026 makes them more capable security researchers,\u201d he continued.</p><p>As the technology continues to develop, Salva sees generative AI coding to expand far beyond its current technological bounds. That includes \u201ctaking a big bet\u201d on conversational AI. \u201cWe also see AI-assisted development really percolating up into other parts of the software development life cycle,\u201d he said, like using AI to autonomously <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/topics/ci-cd/\">repair a CI/CD build errors</a>, patch security vulnerabilities, or have the AI review human-written code.</p><p>\u201cJust as we use compilers to produce machine-level code today, I do think they'll eventually get to another layer of abstraction with AI that allows developers to express themselves in a different language,\u201d Salva said. \u201cMaybe it's natural language like English or French, or Korean. And that then gets \u2018compiled down\u2019 to something that the machines can understand,\u201d freeing up engineers and developers to focus on the overall growth of the project rather than the nuts and bolts of its construction.</p><h2><strong>From coders to gabbers</strong></h2><p>With human decision-making still firmly wedged within the AI programming loop, at least for now, we have little to fear from having software writing software. As Salva noted, computers already do this to a degree when compiling code, and digital gray goos have yet to take over because of it. Instead, the most immediate challenges facing programming AI mirror those of generative AI in general: inherent biases skewing training data, model outputs that <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/09/github_copilot_lawsuit/\">violate copyright</a>, and concerns surrounding user data privacy when it comes to training large language models.</p><p>GitHub is far from alone in its efforts to build an AI programming buddy. OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT is capable of generating code \u2014 as are the already countless indie variants being built atop the GPT platform.

Apparently, one of the main priorities for the future of the technology is to increase its range. At the moment, NFC only works if two enabled devices are within 5 millimeters from each other, but the group says it's currently examining ranges that are &quot;four to six times the current operating distance.&quot;</p><p>That's 30 millimeters or 1.18 inches at most, but it could enable faster transactions and fewer failed ones overall, seeing as a longer range also means there's a lower precision requirement for antenna alignment. In addition, the forum is looking to improve the current NFC wireless charging specification of 1 watt to 3 watts. The capability will bring wireless charging to &quot;new and smaller form factors,&quot; the forum said, but didn't give examples of what those form factors could look like.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Another potential future NFC capability will support several actions with a single tap.

But a standardized capability would allow more people, especially in developing countries where Android is more prevalent, to use their devices to offer payments for their small businesses and shops.&nbsp;</p><p>These plans are in varying stages of development right now, with some further along than others.

The production ramp-up comes as Ford aims to roll out two million EVs by 2026, with the All-Electric Explorer, Mustang Mach-E and E-Transit already available and an EV lineup in the works for Lincoln. In comparison, Ford produced about 132,000 EVs in 2022.

Gina Raimondo, the US Secretary of Commerce, has announced that the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is launching a public working group for AI technologies that can generate content, including text, images, videos, music and code. The group will also help the agency develop key guidance that organizations can follow to address risks brought by generative AI tech.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the agency, the group will be composed of volunteers with technical expertise from the private and public sectors and will work together via a collaborative online workspace. To start with, the group will gather input on how the NIST AI Risk Management Framework \u2014 the framework the agency developed to &quot;better manage risks to individuals, organizations and society associated with artificial intelligence&quot; \u2014 may be used to support the development of generative AI tech. Then, the group is expected to support the agency's AI-related tests and evaluations. Its long-term goal, however, is to explore opportunities on how generative AI can be used to solve the most pressing issues of our time, such as problems related to health, climate change and the environment as a whole.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Raimondo said in a statement:</p><p>&quot;President Biden has been clear that we must work to harness the enormous potential while managing the risks posed by AI to our economy, national security and society. The recently released NIST AI Risk Management Framework can help minimize the potential for harm from generative AI technologies. Building on the framework, this new public working group will help provide essential guidance for those organizations that are developing, deploying and using generative AI, and who have a responsibility to ensure its trustworthiness.&quot;</p><p>The government has been scrambling to keep up with the rapidly advancing pace of generative AI technology. In April, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/biden-administration-wants-your-input-on-rules-for-ai-models-like-chatgpt-193527890.html\">asked for public comments</a> on possible regulations that would hold AI creators accountable.

Then in June, Representatives Ted Lieu (D-CA) and Ken Buck (R-CO) introduced legislation that would establish a 20-person commission to study ways to &quot;mitigate the risks and possible harms&quot; of AI while also &quot;protecting&quot; America's position as a global technology power. The legislation came after Microsoft vice chair and president Brad Smith spoke at Washington, DC and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-appeals-for-a-new-us-agency-to-regulate-ai-095510698.html\">called on</a> the US federal government to establish a new agency that's focused on regulating AI.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/us-calls-upon-volunteer-experts-to-help-address-generative-ai-risks-063956572.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/us-calls-upon-volunteer-experts-to-help-address-generative-ai-risks-063956572.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-06-23 06:39:56+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
