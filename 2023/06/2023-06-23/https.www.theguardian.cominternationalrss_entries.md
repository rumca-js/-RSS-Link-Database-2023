<p>Annabel Sutherland had advantages early in life but her first Test century shows she has never stopped learning</p><p>In terms of sporting provenance stories, having a national cricket board CEO for a father doesn’t hit the inspirational high notes. James Sutherland spent two decades at the top for Cricket Australia and, like some players, probably held on a few years too long. When he did make way, it at least partially cleared the air for his children, Annabel and Will, to pursue playing careers.</p><p>No doubt being connected to power in the game opened plenty of doors and gained access to the best development. It gave them a life so entwined with cricket, perhaps attempting to play it was inevitable. The one drawback to all these advantages would be on reaching the top level, where perhaps a player has to do more to justify their presence.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/23/australian-women-sutherland-picks-up-perrys-baton">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Black River by Nilanjana Roy; Thirty Days of Darkness by Jenny Lund Madsen; Killingly by Katharine Beutner; The End of Us by Olivia Kiernan; The Trial by Rob Rinder</p><p><strong><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/black-river-9781782279433/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article">Black River</a></strong><strong> by </strong><strong>Nilanjana Roy</strong><strong> (</strong><strong>Pushkin Vertigo, £16.99)</strong><strong><br /></strong>Framed as a police procedural, but with the breadth of a saga, this ambitious novel begins with the murder of an eight-year-old girl in a village a few hours from Delhi. Young Munia is strung from a tree because she has witnessed the killing of a woman, and the man who finds her body – homeless, mentally fragile and a Muslim – is considered by the villagers to be the culprit. As under-resourced local cop Ombir Singh wrestles with his conscience, the story loops back to before Munia’s birth, when her father, Chand, comes to Delhi and makes a life for himself beside the Yamuna river, which is slowly becoming a polluted horror. Eventful years pass until the past catches up with the present, and we return to Chand’s attempts to discover his daughter’s real killer. Purists may require more overarching suspense, but individual scenes shimmer with tension in this dazzling, lyrical tale of friendship, love and grief that shines a light on the corruption and religious sectarianism of modern India.</p><p><strong><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/thirty-days-of-darkness-9781914585616?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article">Thirty Days of Darkness</a> by Jenny Lund Madsen</strong><strong>, translated by </strong><strong>Megan Turney</strong><strong> </strong><strong>(Orenda, £16.99)</strong><strong> </strong><strong><br /></strong>Madsen’s caustically funny debut begins with a public altercation between bestselling mystery writer Jørn Jensen and Hannah Krause-Bendix, who writes books “in which an old man takes a sip of coffee, then stops to think for about 40 pages, before taking another sip”. When Hannah rashly accepts Jørn’s challenge to write a crime novel in a month, her editor dispatches her to a family friend in rural Iceland for the necessary peace and quiet. Hannah soon discovers that creating a decent plot is far harder than she had originally thought – but finds an actual plot unfolding under her nose when her hostess’s teenage nephew is murdered. Ignoring the advice of the small town’s only police officer, she starts to investigate and soon finds herself in the middle of a real Nordic noir. Can she solve the mystery and finish her novel? With a wonderful “love to hate” central character – Hannah is a prickly, judgmental alcoholic with poor impulse control – this is an original and thoroughly enjoyable treat.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/23/the-best-recent-and-thrillers-review-roundup">Continue reading...</a>

## The Flash’s box office struggles are a mess of DC’s own making

Or have we all just had enough of major studios’ middling, comic-book cash-ins?</p><p>It was billed (admittedly by the studio itself) as “<a href="https://movieweb.com/the-flash-left-studio-bemused/">probably one of the greatest superhero movies ever made</a>”, the film to reset the multiverse just in time for James Gunn’s much-garlanded arrival as new DC head honcho. But while the box office greenbacks collected by any given movie are not always a valid mark of its long term place in the cinematic pantheon, The Flash’s $55m US opening last weekend has had industry types running in circles trying to find the door marked “box office bomb”.</p><p>The Hollywood Reporter said that the Andy Muschietti-directed superhero epic <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/the-flash-flameout-box-office-flameout-david-zaslav-1235518567/">did even worse than 2009’s Watchmen</a>, while Variety quoted an “industry insider” who described the film’s performance as an “unmitigated disaster” and <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/the-flash-box-office-dc-blue-beetle-aquaman-1235650170/">pondered if the movie would even break even</a>.

Even amongst leave voters, 71% now favour a closer relationship with the EU.</p><p>The poll also suggests that 56% of people want the UK to at least rejoin the single market (with 43% favouring rejoining the EU in full, and 13% favouring just returning to the single market).</p><p>Our polling shows that there is a large majority of the British public who recognise that Brexit in its current form isn’t working and would like to see the UK moving closer to the EU. This creates a substantial political space to move the debate forward from refighting the old battles about whether Brexit was right or wrong, to discussing what an improved future relationship with the EU should look like. <br /><br />The EU will always remain a key strategic ally, and it is absurd that the bloc has deeper trading arrangements with Israel and Georgia, better regulatory recognition on food-safety standards with Canada and New Zealand, and deeper mechanisms for political co-operation with nations including Australia and Japan.</p><p>Any future British government that wants to improve the relationship with the EU will need a carefully considered strategic plan – and make a clear-eyed offer to the other side. Asking the EU nicely cannot succeed as a negotiating strategy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/jun/23/brexit-anniversary-poll-eu-rishi-sunak-jeremy-hunt-inflation-mortgages-uk-politics-live">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Today’s fluff is firing on all cylinders</p><p>Before the end of the window every single top-flight footballer from Newcastle to Naples will be linked with a move to the charming Saudi Pro League. The latest to add to that list is Liverpool forward <strong>Mohamed Salah</strong>. No specific club in Saudi Arabia has been associated with this potential transfer but that does not matter when loads of money is involved.</p><p><strong>Romelu Lukaku</strong> does not look set for a return to Chelsea. Instead he could be in for a controversial summer with <strong>Milan</strong> hoping to beat <strong>Internazionale</strong>, where he spent last season on loan, to the Belgian’s signature. Ooooh the scandal. At least he will not have to move house and knows the way to the ground.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/23/football-transfer-rumours-mohamed-salah-leave-liverpool-saudi-arabia">Continue reading...</a>

## Ahmed Ben Ali: Subhana review | Ammar Kalia's global album of the month

<p><strong>(Habibi Funk)</strong><br />Ali’s self-produced album features his trademark bright, melodic sound, blending Libyan folk, reggae, zokra and synths with striking results</p><p>From Maha’s 80s Egyptian orchestral pop to Fadoul’s 70s Moroccan psych-funk, independent label Habibi Funk has spent the best part of the last decade platforming fascinating, cross-cultural music from the Arab world. Their latest niche is Libyan reggae, a popular genre in the country since Bob Marley’s music arrived in the 70s and local acts honed their own takes on the sound. The label previously released 2021’s dub-laden single Tendme by Tripoli-born Ibrahim Hesnawi; their latest record, singer Ahmed Ben Ali’s Subhana, showcases the full breadth of the music’s ingenuity.</p><p>Ali draws on rhythmic similarities between Libyan folk and reggae’s offbeat, and its call-and-response vocal, and then uses synths to create his yearning melodies. Yarait and Subhana are the clearest examples of his fusion, replacing dub’s dilatory echoes with a slightly faster tempo, mirroring the bounce and pace of Libya’s zokra music, while adding a punchy combination of synth horns and clavinet bass: a funky and propulsive foundation that allows Ali’s melismatic vocal to soar.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/23/ahmed-ben-ali-subhana-review-global-album-month-libyan-folk-reggae">Continue reading...</a>

## Isabelle Huppert: ‘When you’re an actor, you keep secrets’

<p>The fearless French actor is known for playing powerful, complex women, mostly recently in Jean-Paul Salomé’s corporate drama La Syndicaliste. But she has her own way of balancing loyalty to film with her feminist principles</p><p>Isabelle Huppert has a way of inspiring intrigue – even without trying. On the red carpet at Cannes last month, she raised eyebrows with her choice of footwear: a pair of <a href="https://www.balenciaga.com/en-gb/anatomic-80mm-pump-black-678882WBCW01000.html">Balenciaga Anatomic heels</a>, whose tips are moulded to look like human toes. It seemed like quintessential Huppert: an arch joke about the furore over the festival’s insistence on heels for women at events, rising above the idiotic dictate and the barefoot rebels who have recently flouted it.</p><p>Except apparently I’m overthinking it: “People were looking at my shoes?” asks the actor, in her soigné tones, on the phone from Paris. Yes, those weird ones with toes. “No, I wasn’t making any statement. Though they were very comfortable, so I was able to climb the steps very pleasantly.” She probably has that nonplussed expression she does so well. It seems very Huppert to deny everything, too.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/23/isabelle-huppert-when-youre-an-actor-you-keep-secrets">Continue reading...</a>

Likewise, lowering the baby (or in our case, large toddler) into the cot, which if you’re a woman of average height involves squatting over one of the corners and hoping you don’t bash your crotch on it so that your swearing wakes them up, something which definitely hasn’t happened to me – ever. Basically, they are designed for babies who are heavy sleepers, and tall men.</p><p>Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist and author</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/23/holidays-parent-child-travel-cot">Continue reading...</a>
