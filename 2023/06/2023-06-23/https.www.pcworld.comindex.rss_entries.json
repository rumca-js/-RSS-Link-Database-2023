While Microsoft uses this feature to try and recommend things it thinks you&rsquo;ll enjoy, oftentimes it just gets in the way. Also, if the computer is used by more than one person, this is a security risk as it indicates the activities of the last user. Luckily, it&rsquo;s not difficult to deactivate these via Search Permissions in Windows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to do this, you should switch off the search history and delete the existing entries. You can do both in one go via an option in the <em>Settings</em> of Windows. To do this, go to the <em>Privacy &amp; security</em> tab and click on <em>Search permissions</em>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scroll down to <em>History</em> and set the switch to <em>Off</em>. The search terms will then have disappeared and Windows will no longer save any more searches. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a good way to hide your search history in Windows&mdash;however, as soon as someone switches the history back on, the search terms will be there again. To prevent this history from showing up in the future, simply click on <em>Clear device search history</em>.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Windows search history\" class=\"wp-image-1963602\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/search-history.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>To stop Windows from showing your last search entries, turn off the search history and delete the saved searches.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Foundry</p></div>\n\nWindows</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1961730/switch-off-the-windows-search-history.html", "date_published": "2023-06-23 19:44:30+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "U.S. Army warns against unsolicited smartwatches sent to service members", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a recent alert from the U.S. Army&rsquo;s Criminal Investigation Division, someone is sending free smartwatches to military members across all American branches.

Not only are the computing boards cheap, but you can do so much with them. Wild, wonderful projects spring up all the time with RPi boards as a central piece. The latest creation to catch our eye might just rank as one of the most astonishing: a truck transformed into a dot matrix printer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As spotted by <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.tomshardware.com/news/raspberry-pi-truck-printer&amp;xcust=2-1-1965066-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tom&rsquo;s Hardware</a>, YouTuber Ryder Damen (who runs the channel <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/c/RyderCalmDown/&amp;xcust=2-1-1965066-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ryder Calm Down</a>) uses a Raspberry Pi to control his homebrew &ldquo;printer,&rdquo; which involves a pickup truck, water, and a whole array of gear to spell out messages on the ground. Damen calls it &ldquo;skywriting, but on the road.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the video, Damen explains how the idea came to be (watching trucks paint markers on the road), as well as the process of constructing the &ldquo;printer&rdquo; and the materials used. A plywood and a trailer hitch form the frame of the rig, with solenoids, valves, and hoses then mounted to the wood to serve as printer parts. The solenoids control the valves&mdash;when 12V current is applied to them, they open. Meanwhile, the hoses split the water flow from a central point (a pump and a bucket full of water) to each valve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Controlling the setup is the Raspberry Pi, which is connected to each valve through a relay and the solenoids. Damen created a website on the device, on which you can type the message you want and choose the speed of the print job. (Damen comments in the video that you can also choose the font, but &ldquo;only one font works.&rdquo;) The message is then converted to an image, analyzed, and then divided into segments based on the number of valves on the truck. The code determines whether each valve is in an area considered light or dark: If dark, the valve spurts water. If light, valve stays off.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Dot Matrix Truck Printer\" class=\"wp-image-1965071\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-22-123221.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Sample messages from Damen&rsquo;s chronicle of the project on YouTube.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Ryder Damen / YouTube</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of the video, Damen shares some of the ups and downs of bringing the project to fruition, complete with all the troubleshooting involved at each stage of the process. (When it looked like the Raspberry Pi might have been killed off by the first relay used, I actually gasped in sympathy&mdash;as Damen notes, the Raspberry Pi has been hard to come by and replacing it would be difficult.) It&rsquo;s a fun journey to follow, especially if you spent years around dot matrix printers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you happen to want to build your own road-writing truck, the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://github.com/ryderdamen&amp;xcust=2-1-1965066-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">code for the project</a> is now available on GitHub&mdash;and the Raspberry Pi Foundation says <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1939160/at-last-the-raspberry-pi-shortage-is-finally-coming-to-an-end.html\">supply will soon increase</a> at long last, making it possible to get your hands on one again.

Four PC players run and swing around shooting rockets at a VR player, who takes the form of a giant &ldquo;boss&rdquo; trying to grab them and throw them into oblivion. The concept is absolutely brilliant, even if a concept is basically all it is. The bite-sized play sessions give me <em>Attack on Titan</em> vibes, but the real draw is that you don&rsquo;t need a VR headset to participate in the fun. <em>-Michael Crider</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><em>Viewfinder</em></h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Viewfinder\" class=\"wp-image-1965215\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/viewfinder.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Steam</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In this spiritual follow-up to <em>Superliminal</em>, you can manipulate the world around you by bringing items from photographs into reality.

You don&rsquo;t need to be a train fanatic to appreciate its cute take on model train building, which is still challenging despite the mellow vibe. You&rsquo;ll have to pay close attention as you build stations and lay track, as there&rsquo;s no undo. Fortunately, even when you make a mistake (as I often did), the gorgeous art and soothing background music dull any distress you&rsquo;ll feel. <em>-Alaina Yee</em></p>\n\nGaming, Video Games</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1965182/12-steam-next-fest-game-demos-you-must-play.html", "date_published": "2023-06-23 10:30:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "An entire IT education begins with this CompTIA bundle", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to make a career in the world of IT and cybersecurity, you need to earn the proper certifications.
