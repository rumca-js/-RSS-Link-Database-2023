According to Director Hiroshi Takai, Final Fantasy XVI has a lot of side quests, and he sees them as one of the game’s most important pieces of additional content. “When compared with other recent AAA titles, I think Final Fantasy XVI really has a lot of side quests,” says Takai. “Some of them are directly connected, too. For example, you might complete a quest near the beginning of the game, and then after a while a new side quest unlocks. I believe we have a lot of variety in our side quests. That being said, while there are a lot of them, we didn’t want any of them to feel unnecessary.”
