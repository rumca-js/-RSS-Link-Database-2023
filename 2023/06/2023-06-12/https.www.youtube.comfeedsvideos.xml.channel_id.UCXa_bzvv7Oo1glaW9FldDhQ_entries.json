The new Kameo Fighters include the likes of Kano, Jax, Sonya Blade, Goro (yes, that Goro), Stryker, Kung Lao and Sub-Zero.\n\nThey have their OG looks, and you can summon them to perform Special Moves, set up combos, and even sick Fatalities in battles. You can't spam them continuously, but they can provide great offensive and defensive options.\n\nThe main roster includes Kung Lao, Sub-Zero, Scorpion, Liu Kang, Raiden, Kitana and Mileena. Johnny Cage and Kenshi are newly confirmed, and Shang Tsung is a pre-order bonus. Everyone has different origins from the previous games, but many of their abilities - like Sub-Zero's Ice Clone and Scorpion's Stinger - remain.\n\nMortal Kombat 1 is out on September 19th for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC and Nintendo Switch, so stay tuned for more details.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOLY0Ul9gsc", "date_published": "2023-06-12 20:30:05+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Aliens: Dark Descent - 13 Things You NEED TO KNOW Before You Buy", "description": "In Aliens: Dark Descent, players control a squad of Marines as they explore the Xenomorph-infested Lethe.

Permadeath, which means bringing in recruits at the Otago, your ship and hub. Five Marine classes are available, each with unique upgrades and weapons like sniper rifles, RPG launchers, incinerator units, and more.\n\nMeanwhile, you can research new technologies, upgrade weapons, manage the Medbay, and break up fights with Marines.

After all, it\u2019s not every day that we get to see a new flagship RPG by Bethesda Game Studios, who are and always have been absolute masters of that genre- especially one that\u2019s a new IP. \n\nAnd though the response to all that we\u2019d seen of it over the past couple of years had ranged from lukewarm to somewhat positive, with the recent Starfield Direct, BGS completely and thoroughly turned that around. With a ridiculously comprehensive deep dive, the developer showed off the upcoming space-faring RPG and told us exactly why we should be excited for it- and boy did they do it well. Here, we\u2019re going to go through all of the major details they revealed about Starfield. So buckle in, because there\u2019s a lot to get into.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seKwOSb0aIM", "date_published": "2023-06-12 11:45:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
