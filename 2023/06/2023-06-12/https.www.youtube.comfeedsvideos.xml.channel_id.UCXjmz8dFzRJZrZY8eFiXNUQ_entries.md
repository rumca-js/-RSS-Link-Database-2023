New Girls is hands down one of the more successful sitcoms of the last 10 years.  One of the main reasons New Girl lasted as long as it did was the attachment fans had to the primary cast.  Though, at first many people found Schmidt annoying and irritating.  Luckily over the course of 7 Seasons, New Girl was able to turn Schmidt into a fan favorite character.
