Announced at Summer Game Fest 2023, Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown is a 2D action-adventure platformer developed by Ubisoft Montpellier, the studio behind the beloved Rayman Legends. 

After playing an early build of the game, it appears Ubisoft are looking to the past and present in the hopes of creating a future for the franchise; a return to Prince Of Persia's roots in 2D platforming, on the foundations built by modern metroidvania titles. However, the question of whether the game has anything innovative of its own to offer remains to be seen.
