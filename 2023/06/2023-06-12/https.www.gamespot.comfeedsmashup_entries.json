Though the studio didn't pack too much into its press conference, the event provided fans with a closer look at a few key titles.</p><p>Most prominent was <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragons-dogma-2-gameplay-trailer-reveals-a-much-bigger-world-but-no-release-date/1100-6515116/\">Dragon's Dogma 2</a>, the highly-anticipated follow-up to 2012's Dragon's Dogma. Thanks to the Capcom Showcase, we now know the open-world, fantasy RPG features a world that feels \"roughly four times larger\" than the one found in the original. The event also revealed a bit more about the character on the game's cover, Ulrika and Nadina, as well as additional information regarding the game's pawn and physics systems.</p><p>In addition to Dragon's Dogma 2, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ace-attorney-apollo-justice-trilogy-resurrects-games-from-the-3ds-eshop-shutdown/1100-6515153/\">Capcom announced a new Ace Attorney Trilogy</a> that combines its three most recent mainline entries, as well as a <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-trick-phantom-detective-demo-is-now-available-play/1100-6515154/\">Ghost Trick demo</a>. After being announced at the Xbox Games Showcase, Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess made a return, complete with a bit more information about the game.</p><p>Capcom also revealed more information about its upcoming dinosaur-shooter, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/exoprimal/\">Exoprimal</a>, before announcing that <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/capcom-reminds-us-pragmata-still-exists-then-delays-it-indefinitely/1100-6515152/\">Pragmata will be receiving yet another delay</a>.

According to the studio, the game will be a third-person melee combat game that blends strategy and action across an epic tale. Kunitsu-Gami is slated to release on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC, though Capcom has not yet announced a release window.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/capcom-reveals-new-onimusha-like-action-game-kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess/1100-6515058/\">Capcom Reveals New Onimusha-Like Action Game, Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</a></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Ace Attorney: Apollo Justice Trilogy</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1639/16394322/4151762-capcomshowcase_6.12.202351-42screenshot%281%29.png\" /><br /><h3><p>Court is back in session thanks to the <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ace-attorney-apollo-justice-trilogy-resurrects-games-from-the-3ds-eshop-shutdown/1100-6515153/\">Ace Attorney: Apollo Justice Trilogy</a>. This collection features Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney, Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Dual Destinies, and Phoenix Write: Ace Attorney - Spirit of Justice, the three most recent entries in the mainline Ace Attorney series which released in 2007, 2013, and 2016 respectively. The trilogy will release on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, and translates the games into seven languages, making the titles more widely available than ever before.

Shu Takumi, the creator of Ghost Trick, dropped by the Capcom Showcase to give fans another look at the upcoming game, as well as announce that <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-trick-phantom-detective-demo-is-now-available-play/1100-6515154/\">a demo is now available to play</a>.

After being announced back in 2020, the game has been delayed multiple times. During Capcom's Summer Showcase, the studio announced that the game has now been delayed indefinitely. Thankfully, there is a silver lining in that we finally saw new footage of the game, in which an astronaut picks up a young girl named Diana after a shootout in a space station-like facility. Pragmata is slated to release on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/capcom-reminds-us-pragmata-still-exists-then-delays-it-indefinitely/1100-6515152/\">Capcom Reminds Us Pragmata Still Exists, Then Delays It Indefinitely</a></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Exoprimal</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1639/16394322/4151767-capcomshowcase_6.12.202358-16screenshot.png\" /><br /><h3><p>Weeks ahead of the game's second open beta, Capcom opted to give fans another look at its upcoming dino-packed shooter, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/exoprimal-is-getting-a-second-open-beta-right-before-launch/1100-6515156/\">Exoprimal</a>. The Capcom Showcase featured a new story trailer for the game, as well as more details regarding what enemies you can expect to square up against. The studio also dished out some details on Exoprimal's battle pass, and the dates you can play the upcoming beta: June 16-18. Exoprimal will release on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC on July 14.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/exoprimal-is-getting-a-second-open-beta-right-before-launch/1100-6515156/\">Exoprimal Is Getting A Second Open Beta Right Before Launch</a></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Dragon's Dogma 2</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1639/16394322/4151781-capcomshowcase_6.12.20231-6-41screenshot.png\" /><br /><h3><p>To close out the Capcom Showcase, the developer revealed <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragons-dogma-2-gameplay-trailer-reveals-a-much-bigger-world-but-no-release-date/1100-6515116/\">our first good look at Dragon's Dogma 2</a> following its reveal last year. Capcom said some of the 2012 game's key aspects will return, including its Pawn system, which allows for players to form a party with up to three other AI allies--something Capcom also says makes the game feel like it's played in co-op even as it's strictly single-player game. The team also said the open-world setting returns, but with a twist. Player ingenuity is now a greater focus, which will allow players to problem-solve in new ways using \"immersive physics,\" such as destroying a bridge in the middle of combat with a hulking monster. New and returning monsters await in Dragon's Dogma, though no release date was yet revealed.</p></h3></p><br />", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/capcom-summer-showcase-2023-the-biggest-game-announcements/2900-4775/", "date_published": "2023-06-12 23:22:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Dragon's Dogma 2 Gameplay Trailer Reveals A Much Bigger World But No Release Date", "description": "<p>We got a fresh look at Dragon's Dogma 2 during <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/capcom-summer-showcase-2023-the-biggest-game-announcements/2900-4775/\">Capcom's showcase event</a>. A lot of what we learned was that Dragon's Dogma 2 will be similar to the original, but Capcom dropped a few tidbits worth digging into, including news about the world size and physics-based gameplay.</p><p>Dragon's Dogma was a cult hit, having received decent reviews at launch but gathering a bigger fan following in the years since. This sequel will run on the RE engine, and original game director Hideaki Itsuno has returned for it. Capcom has kept the game mostly under wraps but previously promised AI- and physics-driven tech, along with a wide array of weapon types and classes.</p><div>          </div><p>Dragon's Dogma 2 will be set in a world roughly four times the size of the original Dragon's Dogma, director Hideaki Itsuno said during the stream.

Based on the patch notes, the 1.1 update addresses several key complaints that players have voiced since the game's launch, especially in the gameplay department. However, given its file size of 32 GB, you may need to free up some hard drive space to download it.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://bethesda.net/en/article/78dNMNH552rqm2NPbDxy2P/redfall-v1-1-release-notes?utm_source=Bethesda&amp;utm_medium=referral\">full patch notes</a> are below, but in short, nearly every aspect of the game has been improved in some way. For example, enemy spawn rates have been increased across the board, and players can move without interruption when using melee attacks. In combat, several instances of enemies randomly standing in place have been corrected, several enemy types like The Rook have been buffed, and vampire melee attacks have been improved.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The patch also removes some of Redfall's technical problems. These include particle effects that caused the frame rate to tank, improved lighting performance in psychic spaces, and general improvements to stability across the board.

Gunfire Games blended key mechanics from the Souls-like genre with the looter-shooter gameplay loop of Destiny, and the result was a tough and engrossing third-person shooter with a ton of replay value. Based on an hour-long hands-on session, Remnant 2 is shaping up to be an ambitious sequel that smooths out many of the rough edges from the original.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Like the original, you will be able to choose from a number of archetypes, or classes, that can be tweaked and upgraded to fit various playstyles. However, Remnant 2 introduces dual archetypes that allow you to pick a second archetype once you've progressed far enough. In my session, I decided to pick the Handler archetype. Handlers are a support class that are paired up with trusty canine companions that can attack enemies, buff teammates, and pick up downed allies. According to Gunfire Games, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remnant-2-makes-a-good-case-for-having-a-dog-with-you-in-a-world-of-monsters/1100-6512744/\">the Handler also makes for a solid solo play archetype because your dog can revive you if you get knocked down</a>. You can also pet him.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Commanding the pup around the battlefield also felt intuitive. With a single button, you can issue multiple commands depending on what you're looking at and how long you hold the action button down for. With a single quick press, your dog either attacks an enemy or heals an ally depending on what you're aiming at, a double tap recalls the dog, and holding down the button will buff your teammates. As you progress, you'll unlock new abilities and skills for you and your dog which should shake things up.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remnant-2-is-shaping-up-to-be-an-ambitious-sequel-with-a-very-good-dog/1100-6515148/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remnant-2-is-shaping-up-to-be-an-ambitious-sequel-with-a-very-good-dog/1100-6515148/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-06-12 20:37:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora Shares A Lot Of Far Cry DNA", "description": "<img height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1574/15746725/4151707-avatar_v0.jpg\" width=\"480\" /> Lucy and Tamoor discuss the new Avatar game from Ubisoft Massive: how it ties into Jim Cameron's Avatar movies, and how its core gameplay has a lot of similarities with Far Cry.", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/videos/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-shares-a-lot-of-far-cry-dna/2300-6461665/", "date_published": "2023-06-12 20:30:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "22 Minutes of Final Fantasy 16 Combat & Boss Battle Gameplay", "description": "<img height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1574/15746725/4151649-gameplay_ff16demo_sgf_v1_20230612_v3.jpg\" width=\"480\" /> Captured from the new PS5 demo of Final Fantasy XVI, enjoy this combat from the post-prologue action focused challenge mode.", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/videos/22-minutes-of-final-fantasy-16-combat-boss-battle-gameplay/2300-6461662/", "date_published": "2023-06-12 20:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Break This Digital Pinata Filled With 20 Random PC Games For $13.49", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Fanatical's new <span class=\"norewrite\">           <a href=\"https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-100770772-13797872?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.fanatical.com/en/bundle/fiesta-mystery-bundle\">Fiesta Mystery Bundle just launched,</a> </span> giving customers a chance to grab a batch of mystery PC game keys for less than $1 each.</p><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-100770772-13797872?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.fanatical.com/en/bundle/fiesta-mystery-bundle\">Break the pinata at Fanatical</a> </div></div><p dir=\"ltr\"> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Customers get to pick how many keys they want, starting at just one key for $1 and scaling up to 20 games for $13.49.

The company delivered, with a much longer look at the game.</p><p>In a stage presentation, Ubisoft's Julian Gerighty said that the reign of the Empire has made a time of opportunity for outlaws. Protagonist Kay Vess is navigating contracts with scoundrels and syndicates while avoiding Imperial entanglements, aiming for a big score.</p><p>A subsequent gameplay demonstration showed Kay sneaking her way through a facility, marking targets for her pet companion to trigger for her to navigate past enemies. When a guard confronts her, she quickly draws and shoots (first), a seeming reference to the classic Han Solo moment from the original trilogy. Another guard used a shield, requiring some direct melee damage to pop, and the ensuing fire fight showed off Kay trying to deal with an overwhelming set of guards before escaping outside onto a speeder bike.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kay-shot-first-in-star-wars-outlaws-gameplay-reveal-trailer/1100-6514917/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kay-shot-first-in-star-wars-outlaws-gameplay-reveal-trailer/1100-6514917/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-06-12 18:22:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Star Wars: Outlaws Developers On Creating The Most Ambitious Star Wars Game Yet", "description": "<p>Star Wars: Outlaws has a few things working against it. For starters, it\u2019s a Star Wars game, and as such comes with extraordinary pressures to deliver. Additionally, there is already a lot of Star Wars content out there\u2014including critically acclaimed video games. And last but certainly not least, Star Wars: Outlaws is an ambitious, open-world adventure, in which \u201copen-world\u201d extends beyond the confines of planets, and it\u2019s no secret Ubisoft has been criticized for how bloated or repetitive its open-world games can be. However, after getting my first look at Outlaws\u2019 gameplay, I find myself echoing Han Solo\u2019s most famous sentiment: Never tell me the odds.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">While the time I spent with Star Wars: Outlaws was brief\u2014I saw about 15 minutes of gameplay\u2014and hands-off, I left feeling like I understood the direction the game was going in and excited for what\u2019s to come. With strategic stealth sections, speeder shoot-outs, seamless surface-to-space travel, an emphasis on making quick decisions (and facing their consequences), and an incredibly charismatic leading lady, Star Wars: Outlaws shows a lot of promise.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Following the demo, I had the opportunity to sit down with game director Mathias Karlson and narrative director Navid Khavari to learn a bit more about Kay Vess, the game\u2019s setting, and how Star Wars: Outlaws is changing not only what a Star Wars game can be, but the shape of the galaxy as a whole. While the team couldn\u2019t answer a few of my more burning questions, such as if the game will have co-op at launch, the insight they provided has me excited for what\u2019s to come, and to truly get to know Kay Vess.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-developers-on-creating-the-most-ambitious-star-wars-game-yet/1100-6515135/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-developers-on-creating-the-most-ambitious-star-wars-game-yet/1100-6515135/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-06-12 18:21:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Star Wars Outlaws UI Is Straight From Solo: A Star Wars Story", "description": "<p>Ubisoft has unveiled a brand-new Star Wars Outlaws gameplay trailer teasing stealth combat, space dogfights, and impressive UI.</p><p>Outlaws is a game focused on the scoundrels, scum, and villainy of the Star Wars universe, a massive and refreshing change from our usual focus on the Jedi.
