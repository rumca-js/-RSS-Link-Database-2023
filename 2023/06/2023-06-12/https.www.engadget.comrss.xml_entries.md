<p>On Monday, it was Ubisoft's turn to take center stage at Summer Game Fest. After Microsoft's strong showing on Sunday, the publisher's showcase was a more sedate affair, with Ubisoft mostly providing updates on games that it had already been previously announced.&nbsp;</p><div id="70b2f9a9305241adb6aefa322327f0b9"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>However, the event did have its share of highlights. One surprise announcement saw <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-new-castlevania-series-other-game-related-reveals-184651262.html"><em>Castlevania </em>showrunner</a> Adi Shankar take the stage in a seriously ridiculous getup to reveal <em>Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix, </em>an animated series based, of all things, on <em>Far Cry 3's </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-04-23-far-cry-3-blood-dragon-welcomes-you-to-the-retro-party.html">Blood Dragon expansion from 2013</a>. After years of development, Ubisoft also offered a first look at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-launch-date-sgf-2023-174516354.html"><em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em></a><em>. </em>But the star of the show was undoubtedly the<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>first gameplay trailer Massive Entertainment shared for its upcoming Star Wars project, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/first-star-wars-outlaws-gameplay-trailer-offers-10-minutes-of-scoundrel-wish-fulfilment-184921702.html"><em>Outlaws</em></a>.

## New York City sets an $18 per hour minimum wage for food delivery workers

<p>New York is about to become the first city in the United States to mandate a minimum wage for food delivery workers. <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/405-23/mayor-adams-dcwp-commissioner-mayuga-nation-s-first-minimum-pay-rate-app-based#/0"><ins>Starting next month</ins></a>, delivery apps, including Uber Eats and GrubHub, will be required to pay their workers $17.96 per hour, plus tips, by July 12th. Then, by 2025, the city will mandate Uber, GrubHub and other players in the space pay delivery workers $19.96 per hour, with adjustments for inflation to follow thereafter.</p><p>The minimum wage in New York City is $15 per hour. By setting the hourly pay for delivery workers above that, the city’s Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) agency notes it’s accounting for the fact Uber, GrubHub and DoorDash classify their delivery workers as contractors, who tend to pay higher taxes and often need to pay work-related expenses out of their own pocket. According to an estimate from the DCWP, there are more than 60,000 food delivery workers in New York, earning an average of $7.09 per hour.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The final hourly rate the city announced on Monday is less than the $23.82 figure the agency had <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/dca/downloads/pdf/workers/Delivery-Worker-Study-November-2022.pdf"><ins>called for in 2022</ins></a> (PDF link). In March, the DCWP revised its estimate to account for “multi-apping,” a practice wherein some workers will deliver for more than one app at the same time. App companies, including Uber and GrubHub, pushed back against the regulation, and now that it’s set to finally go into effect, they’re still not happy about it. &quot;The city is lying to delivery workers – they want apps to fund the $30 per hour wage by eliminating jobs and reducing tipping while forcing the remaining workers to deliver orders faster,&quot; Uber spokesperson Josh Gold told Engadget.</p><p>“While we believe New York City had good intentions, we are disappointed in the DCWP’s final rule, which will have serious adverse consequences for delivery workers in New York City,” a GrubHub spokesperson said. “Unfortunately, New York City chose not to partner with the industry on a solution that would have benefited all aspects of the gig economy.”</p><p>How delivery apps pay their workers is up to them, so long as they meet the minimum set by the city. Companies that pay only for trip time must pay approximately 50 cents per minute, while firms that compensate workers for the entire time they’re logged in, including any downtime waiting for an order, must pay approximately 30 minutes per minute, not including tips. The law comes after New York began enforcing a minimum wage for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nyc-gig-drivers-pay-increase-012304976.html"><ins>Uber and Lyft drivers</ins></a> in 2022.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/new-york-city-sets-an-18-per-hour-minimum-wage-for-food-delivery-workers-193338002.html?src=rss

## Grubhub lays off 15 percent of its employees

<p>The technology industry has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech-layoffs-183005386.html">hit hard</a> by layoffs this year, and GrubHub is the latest to cut staff. The company’s CEO Howard Migdal <a href="https://about.grubhub.com/news/a-message-from-howard-migdal-grubhub-ceo/">announced</a> today that the company will be letting go of roughly 400 employees, or 15 percent of its corporate workforce. The layoffs will supposedly help Grubhub stay &quot;competitive&quot; with the market.</p><p>He said, &quot;Over the last few months, I met with Grubhub teams to learn about the business from the ground up; I spoke to restaurants and diners to understand their needs – and challenges – when using our service.&quot; Impacted employees will be &quot;notified over the next several hours.&quot; Migdal goes on to say that he understands that this will be a difficult time for all employees. For those who are keeping their jobs, he claims that more details about “our future together” will surface in the coming days.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Back in March of this year, Grubhub’s then CEO Adam DeWitt <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/delivery/2023/grubhub-ceo-exits-amid-turmoil-in-on-demand-delivery-industry/">announced</a> that he would be stepping down at the start of May amid increasing economic pressure. With Migdal as the new CEO, it’s not terribly surprising that his first move would be to try and reduce operating costs due to the continued economic pressure.</p><p>Grubhub isn’t the first and likely isn’t the last delivery service to start to cut employees. Late last year, DoorDash <a href="https://www.engadget.com/doordash-layoffs-153656792.html">announced</a> that it would be laying off nearly 1,300 employees due to &quot;operating expenses.&quot; The company’s CEO Tony Xu said that DoorDash increased hiring during the pandemic and that operating expenses would continue to outgrow sales.</p><p>The big difference between DoorDash and Grubhub is that the former offered those who were laid off 13 weeks of compensation along with four weeks of severance pay. Grubhub’s announcement today did not mention any sort of compensation or severance pay for those who are being laid off.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/grubhub-lays-off-15-percent-of-its-employees-190005627.html?src=rss

## First 'Star Wars Outlaws' gameplay trailer offers 10 minutes of scoundrel wish fulfilment

<p>&nbsp;When Ubisoft shared the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisofts-open-world-star-wars-game-is-outlaws-coming-to-xbox-series-xs-ps5-and-pc-in-2024-172738697.html">first look at <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a> on Sunday during Microsoft's Xbox and Starfield Showcase, the publisher promised it would have an extended gameplay trailer to share during its Ubisoft Forward event on Monday. And boy did it deliver. The company shared 10 minutes of footage that offers a comprehensive look at the upcoming game.&nbsp;</p><div id="e9cad92fdd4c4025b0b1938937f5e572"></div><p>The clip opens on the planet of Toshara with protagonist Kay Vess and her trusty companion Nix sneaking through a criminal syndicate facility. Kay can call on the adorable Nix to help her traverse the environment, while she takes care of knocking out enemies. If she's caught sneaking by a guard, Key has a moment where she, like Han Solo <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_shot_first">before 1997</a>, can shoot first. Once things get messy, combat revolves around a blaster pistol that features a handful of different ammunition types. For instance, there are enemies with energy shields. In the heat of battle, Nix can retrieve blaster rifles dropped by enemies for Kay to use, though it appears they come with limited ammunition. <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> won't limit you to walking everywhere on foot. You can traverse the game's world on a speeder bike, and even take to the skies and space with a starship, with seemingly no loading between different elements of the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="cd706c6f0e454c6c995ee00aee22a430"></div><p><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> will be available next year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and PC. Massive Entertainment, best known for its work on The Division franchise, is leading development on the project, with what seems like Ubisoft's entire stable of first-party studios on support duties. The game runs on Massive's in-house Snowdrop engine and looks stunning as a result.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Catch up on all of the news from Summer Game Fest </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/sgf-2023"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/first-star-wars-outlaws-gameplay-trailer-offers-10-minutes-of-scoundrel-wish-fulfilment-184921702.html?src=rss

## Ubisoft confirms holiday release for ‘Assassin’s Creed: Nexus VR’

<p>Ubisoft has given us the first proper look at Assassin’s Creed Nexus VR for the Meta Quest platform and confirmed a holiday launch window. The news comes via the company’s Ubisoft Forward streaming event as part of the Summer Game Fest. <em>Assassin’s Creed Nexus VR </em>releases for both the Meta Quest Pro, Meta Quest 2 and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-meta-quest-3-is-a-499-mixed-reality-headset-with-full-color-passthrough-141204527.html"><ins>recently-announced Meta Quest 3,</ins></a> though OG Quest owners are out of luck.</p><p>We knew this was coming, as Meta just <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vr-assassins-creed-stranger-things-and-ghostbusters-arrive-on-meta-quest-later-this-year-174119442.html"><ins>held a games showcase event</ins></a> that featured <em>Assassin’s Creed Nexus VR,</em> but there’s now a dedicated trailer. This trailer is light on actual gameplay and heavy on CGI cutscenes, but it definitely confirms that you play in first person as an actual assassin through the magic of VR. Ubisoft says the title lets you experience parkour-style movement, stealth combat and good old-fashioned hand-to-hand fisticuffs in virtual reality.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="0a192afd0a8f4d74ae80b0e77997ddc6"></div><p>The game brings back former series protagonists like Ezio, as you’ll be interacting with their memories to access levels. For those weary of the nausea associated with VR, particularly while performing elaborate parkour moves, Ubisoft says the title includes “best-in-class comfort features” to help with vertigo or fear of heights, though we aren’t exactly sure what that means. There’s no price yet, but top-tier Quest titles cap out at around $40. Also, the game looks to be a Quest platform exclusive at launch.</p><p><em>Catch up on all of the news from Summer Game Fest </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/sgf-2023"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-confirms-holiday-release-for-assassins-creed-nexus-vr-181108767.html?src=rss

## Netflix's ‘Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix’ is an anime love letter to the '90s

<p>Ubisoft revealed a teaser trailer today for <em>Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix</em>. The upcoming Netflix anime is based on the 2013 <em>Blood Dragon</em> expansion for <em>Far Cry 3</em> — but it appears to be at least as much of a tongue-in-cheek remix of Ubisoft IP and early 90s nostalgia.</p><p>Series creator Adi Shankar (producer of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-new-castlevania-series-other-game-related-reveals-184651262.html">Netflix’s <em>Castlevania</em> series</a>) introduced the trailer in a campy cyborg getup befitting the source material. “Seven years ago, I got a call from Ubisoft, offering me the opportunity to adapt one of their very, very, very serious franchises into an anime,” Shankar deadpanned. “But instead, I came back to them with a crazy concept inspired by the mood of <em>Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon</em>. This concept used Ubisoft’s vast library of characters, and remixed them into one delirious anime series that would become this love letter to the 90s… or at least how I remembered the 90s.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Shankar describes the series as a violent, dystopian fiction in the spirit of the works of Aldous Huxley, as well as a spoof, satire, dark comedy, love story and “the most philosophically conscious show you’ve watched in a long time.” Bobbypills Studio handles the animation.</p><p><em>Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix</em> is scheduled to premiere worldwide on Netflix this fall.

<p>Ubisoft’s open-world Avatar game is almost here. At the company’s Summer Game Fest preview event, we got a substantial look at the story and gameplay of <em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em>. James Cameron introduced the game in a prerecorded segment, teasing “new environments new flora and fauna and characters”.</p><p>A cinematic trailer lays out how this tale will fit in with the Avatar movies. In short, it’ll cover the events of both games, with the protagonist being kidnapped during the events of the first film and schooled by the human invaders. After the events at the end of Avatar, you are cryogenically frozen… then unfrozen 15 years later in time to fight the RDA’s continued invasion.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The game itself is an open-world first-person action-adventure game, where you'll be able to combine Na'vi skills and weapons with human assault weapons and a casual rocket launcher or two. (Massive, the studio behind the game, is most recently known for its work on <em>Tom Clancy's The Division 2</em>.)</p><div id="c83c19a613554d3dbba69baaa4f1b2f8"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>Your Na'vi instincts will work like a scanner for detecting enemies and environment features. You'll be able to grow your character to fit your own playstyle, crafting weaponry and items from resources and upgrading your own skills as you see fit. The skill tree will include upgrades to agility and other attributes tied into your deepening understanding of your Na'vi heritage... by interacting with plants and other Na'vi.</p><p>&nbsp;It wouldn't be an Avatar affair without the ability to bond with sentient animals you can ride. The trailer teases the ability to ride direhorses as well as your very own ikran. You'll be able to feed and customize your partner when not flying down waterfalls. Frontiers of Pandora will include a new western expanse not seen in the movies, where you'll meet as-yet unseen Na'vi clans, including a secretive healer clan.&nbsp;</p><div id="321ce4740ca5410eac3113eb3152ed97"></div><p><em>Frontiers of Pandora</em> launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, PC and, oddly, Luna. (Yes, Luna!) on December 7th 2023.</p><p><em>Catch up on all of the news from Summer Game Fest </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/sgf-2023"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-launch-date-sgf-2023-174516354.html?src=rss

## Apple Mac Studio review (M2 Ultra, 2023): A better Mac for pros

<p>Last year's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-mac-studio-review-m1-ultra-desktop-130044054.html">Mac Studio</a> was the super-powered Mac mini many Apple fans were begging for. But, for the most demanding users, it was unclear if it was worth shelling out $3,999 for the high-end Mac Studio with an M1 Ultra chip, or if they should just wait for the inevitable Mac Pro refresh. Now that Apple has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-refreshes-the-mac-pro-with-its-new-m2-ultra-chip-173145016.html">revamped the Mac Pro with an M2 Ultra chip</a>, the company's desktop lineup finally has something for everyone.</p><p>At the most basic level, there's the $599 Mac Mini. If you need a bit more power, you can get that same<a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-mini-review-m2-pro-2023-140052205.html"> slim machine with an M2 Pro chip</a> for $1,299. Meanwhile, all-in-one fans have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-imac-m1-review-24-inch-portable-desktop-130026556.html">several iMacs</a> to choose from, starting at $1,299 (though it's probably worth waiting for an M2 spec bump).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That leaves the $1,999 Mac Studio as the ideal machine for Apple power users. It'll be enough for video editing work, and it also comes standard with 32GB of RAM (it could use more than 512GB of storage, though). Step up to the $3,999 model with an M2 Ultra chip, and you've got a system that can destroy just about any task you put in front of it. The few professional users who need PCIe expansion can now opt for the M2 Ultra-equipped Mac Pro, which starts at an eye-watering $6,999.</p><p>All of sudden, the higher-end Mac Studio makes so much more sense. It has the same raw power as the Mac Pro, a ton of ports, and it won't take up much room on your desk. What seemed like a curiosity last year, now feels like a tremendous value for power users. Funny how that works, isn't it? (Apple <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-12-18/when-will-apple-aapl-release-the-apple-silicon-mac-pro-with-m2-ultra-chip-lbthco9u?sref=10lNAhZ9">reportedly shelved plans</a> for an even more powerful M2 chip, which could have offered double the power of the M2 Ultra, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>.)</p><figure><img alt="Apple Mac Studio 2023 overhead top view" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/2ae37020-0931-11ee-ab75-527649c2a9a1" style="height: 1333px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>The base Mac Studio is now equipped with an M2 Max chip, featuring a 12-core CPU (with eight performance and four efficiency cores) and a 30-core GPU, as well as 32GB of RAM. Compared to last year's M1 Max, the new chip has two more efficiency cores and six additional GPU cores. What's most notable is the additional upgrade options: You can configure the M2 Max chip with a 38-core GPU and 96GB of RAM (previously you were capped at 32GB of memory).</p><p>Step up to the M2 Ultra and you effectively get two M2 Max chips: It starts with a 24-core CPU, 60-core GPU and 64GB of memory. If you want to truly push your system (and wallet) to the limit, the M2 Ultra can also be configured with a 76-core GPU and 192GB of RAM. With all that power, who needs a full-sized PC tower?</p><p>And really, that's what I kept asking myself as I tested our review unit, which was equipped with an M2 Ultra and 192GB of RAM. The Mac Studio is so ridiculously overpowered, only the most demanding users would need the Mac Pro's PCIe expansion. Since the M2 chips feature unified memory integrated alongside the CPU and GPU, there's no way to add additional RAM down the line, which used to be another reason to get the Mac Pro. At least you can stuff the Mac Studio to the gills with RAM, if you need it.<br /></p><table><tbody><tr><th><p>None</p></th><th><p>Geekbench 5 CPU</p></th><th><p>Geekbench 5 Compute</p></th><th><p>Cinebench R23</p></th><th><p>3DMark Wildlife Extreme</p></th></tr><tr><td><p>Apple Mac Studio (Apple M2 Ultra, 2023)</p></td><td><p>2,013/28,402</p></td><td><p>121,938</p></td><td><p>1,743/28,665</p></td><td><p>46,046</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Apple Mac Mini (Apple M2 Pro, 2022)</p></td><td><p>1,826/13,155</p></td><td><p>43,241</p></td><td><p>1,647/14,598</p></td><td><p>12,769</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch (Apple M2 Max, 2023)</p></td><td><p>1,970/15,338</p></td><td><p>71,583</p></td><td><p>1,603/14,725</p></td><td><p>18 ,487</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Apple Mac Studio (Apple M1 Ultra, 2022)</p></td><td><p>1,785/23,942</p></td><td><p>85,800</p></td><td><p>1,537/24,078</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="" style="font-size: 18px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">Much like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-review-2023-m2-pro-max-140048268.html">M2 Max-powered 14-inch MacBook Pro,</a> Apple's latest chips deliver noticeable performance increases over the M1 generation in just about every benchmark. But it's also not significant enough to run out and replace an M1 system. Instead, the new Mac Studio is an even more tempting machine for Mac users still trucking along with Intel processors, even for some Mac Pro owners.</p><p>In the Geekbench 5 CPU benchmark, the Mac Studio scored higher than any system we've tested this year. But really, that's not a surprise – even last year's M1 Ultra Mac Studio scored higher than the Razer Blade 16, which features Intel's fastest mobile 13th-gen chip. Apple doesn’t always come out ahead: that Blade 16 beat the Mac Studio in the Geekbench 5 Compute benchmark, which you can chalk up to the NVIDIA RTX 4090 under the hood. Still, the Mac Studio's multithreaded Cinebench R23 score (a test that mostly measures CPU performance) was more than double the Blade 16's.</p><p>The new Mac Studio transcoded a 4K video file to 1080p using Handbrake in 21 seconds, three seconds faster than last year's M1 Ultra model. That same job took the Razer Blade 16, the fastest PC we've seen this year, 26 seconds to complete. Scale that saved time up to a feature length project, or encoding jobs you'll need to run several times a day, and the Mac Studio seems like a no-brainer upgrade for some creatives.</p><p>Years ago, some professionals would buy the Mac Pro for its sheer performance, while the internal expansion possibilities were more of an afterthought. The Mac Studio is a system made for them. And now, thanks to Thunderbolt 4 and USB 4, external storage options are fast enough to deal with the demands of a video production shop.</p><p></p><section><img alt="Apple Mac Studio 2023 rear ports" class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/2aca90f0-0931-11ee-9ef9-a794dd798a8f" style="height: 1261px; width: 2000px;" /></section><p>The Mac Studio certainly won't leave you wanting when it comes to ports: On the rear, it features four USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports, two USB 3.2 Type A connections, 10Gbps Ethernet, full-sized HDMI and a headphone jack. There are also two USB-C ports on the front (USB 3 by default, Thunderbolt 4 on the M2 Ultra), alongside a full-sized SD card slot. Just like last year, video editors I've spoken with said they'd prefer a headphone jack on the front, but at least it's easy to get behind the Studio to plug things in. Given the user this machine is aimed at, it also would have been nice to get Thunderbolt 4 ports on the front for every configuration.</p><p>Physically, the Studio is no different than what we saw last year. It's a beautifully polished box that looks like two Mac minis stacked together. It’s far more prominent than that slim desktop, but for Apple devotees, that may be more of a feature than a bug. Now that it no longer seems like a stopgap solution for people eagerly waiting for an upgraded Mac Pro, the Mac Studio looks like the purest expression of what Apple wants a desktop to be in 2023. Why fiddle around with internal hardware when the package Apple delivers is so fully featured?</p><figure><img alt="Apple Mac Studio 2023 front view" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/2aca42d0-0931-11ee-8ad6-b40e0e0daac8" style="height: 1311px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>As I said in my review last year, the Mac Studio isn't meant for everyone: It's a system targeted at people who know their demands are lightyears beyond mainstream users. They won't balk at a $1,999 starting price, or even the $3,999 for the M2 Ultra model, if it means they'll be able to deliver projects faster. On the PC side, you've got alternatives like <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2d327af4-8b42-4ff1-a409-ae7bf906e9e9&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Intel&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyZDMyN2FmNC04YjQyLTRmZjEtYTQwOS1hZTdiZjkwNmU5ZTkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW50ZWwuY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvd3d3L3VzL2VuL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2RvY3MvYm9hcmRzLWtpdHMvbnVjL21pbmktcGNzL251Yy0xMy1leHRyZW1lLmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImNmZTA5Mjk1LTViNDItNDM5OC1hZTk3LWE5MTU0Y2Y3ZjdkMyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAfl0zU7OSblttJ4ZmQAamlZMKwMNS1yfP0WOTAXNviva&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.intel.com%2Fcontent%2Fwww%2Fus%2Fen%2Fproducts%2Fdocs%2Fboards-kits%2Fnuc%2Fmini-pcs%2Fnuc-13-extreme.html">Intel's NUC Extreme</a> small-form factor desktop, but that system has ballooned in size so much that you can't really compare it to the Mac Studio.</p><p>I've gone from being intrigued by the Mac Studio to truly impressed.

It's more than just the big Mac mini – it's a compact Mac Pro that many creatives can actually afford.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apple-mac-studio-review-m2-ultra-2023-170007838.html?src=rss

## 'Alan Wake II' stands out in a sea of sequels

<p>I’m worried about Saga Anderson. She’s a seasoned FBI agent investigating a string of ritualistic deaths around Cauldron Lake, and she’s a little too impressed by all the supernatural gore she encounters. At one point, she’s talking to her partner about the cult activity they’ve seen – the dismembered body parts and necromancy and murderous villagers roaming the forests – and she says, “this place just keeps getting crazier… but this is exciting.”</p><p>A few scenes later, she’s shoving a heart through a portal to another realm and inviting a witch to show her “the terror.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>So, yeah, I’m nervous about Saga’s fate in <em>Alan Wake II</em> – and that only makes me more excited for the full game. I saw a 30-minute hands-off preview of <em>Alan Wake II</em> at Summer Game Fest, set in the second chapter. By this time, Saga has made her peace with the paranormal darkness of the case she’s investigating; she’s already pulled a manuscript page out of a corpse’s chest cavity and followed its instructions to Cauldron Lake, the setting of the original game.</p><p><em>Alan Wake</em> came out 13 years ago, and the timeline in the sequel has also progressed 13 years. The writer Alan Wake has been missing that whole time, and Saga is hunting the ghost of FBI agent Robert Nightingale, who was killed at the end of the first game. In chapter two, Saga and her partner are deep in the Pacific Northwest woods. The preview shows off gorgeous lighting, character models and environments, plus satisfying-looking gunplay and flashlight-play.</p><div id="c93f5d8f5800481b9205f9f71c69e041"></div><p>Dialogue scenes between Saga and her partner aren’t rushed, establishing the narrative and letting it breathe, and there are a few moments where players can choose how to respond. The two agents split up and there are a series of simple puzzles for Saga to solve, like collecting a fuse or finding the right numbers to crack a lock, all while a sense of dread constantly builds in the background. The preview provides some serious early Resident Evil vibes — <em>Alan Wake II</em> is a survival-horror experience, while the original was an action-thriller.</p><p>As Saga attempts to solve the mysteries around her, she can jump into her Mind Place (no, not Mind Palace) to organize clues and connect the dots. Her Mind Place looks like the living room of a ’90s conspiracy theorist, with photos and notes connected by red string along one wood-paneled wall. This is where Saga can manipulate the evidence she’s found, placing clues near each other to see if they’re related, unlocking the path forward. If she gets stuck, she can go to the desk in the center of the room and commune with her subjects, asking them for answers based on the clues she’s gathered; this is called Profiling. Saga can enter her Mind Place at any time.</p><figure><img alt="Alan Wake II's Mind Place" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/c69fcf30-0897-11ee-bdf7-b623cb0deb9e" style="height: 2043px; width: 3630px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Remedy Entertainment</div></figure><p>There are a few jump-scares in the preview, where the screen quickly cuts to a screaming face or an enemy suddenly bursts through a doorway, but they’re well placed and not overdone. Saga feels capable and curious – maybe a little too curious for her own good, but we’ll have to see how that plays out in the full game. At the end of the preview, Alan suddenly appears in the woods with Saga, screaming about dark forces and confused by how long he’s been missing.</p><p>The big innovation in <em>Alan Wake II</em> is the ability to swap between Saga and Alan himself, playing as both characters throughout the game. Chapter one begins with Saga in the driver’s seat, and after that players can choose to play as her or Alan at the beginning of each new section. A Remedy spokesperson said developers are still fine-tuning the swap mechanic; they don’t necessarily want to give players the ability to change characters every five minutes, for the sake of the narrative flow, but they still want to provide real instances of meaningful choice.</p><figure><img alt="Alan Wake II" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/5e901030-08b0-11ee-bfdc-6684623cecd6" style="height: 1500px; width: 2666px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Remedy Entertainment</div></figure><p><em>Alan Wake II</em> is a contained single-player experience and it doesn’t have a bunch of side quests, according to Remedy. There are a few errands to complete and secrets to find parallel to the main story, but this is first-and-foremost a linear, narrative-driven game.&nbsp;</p><p>There were plenty of sequels at the Summer Game Fest showcase, and <em>Alan Wake II</em> stands out in this crowded field. The preview showcased a clear vision: <em>Alan Wake II</em> retains the themes of the original game, but introduces a fresh perspective with the protagonist, mechanics and genre. It feels like Remedy knows the story it's trying to tell — even if Alan and Saga don't.</p><p><em>Alan Wake II</em> is due to hit PC, Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 on October 17th.</p><p><em>Catch up on all of the news from Summer Game Fest </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/sgf-2023"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/alan-wake-ii-stands-out-in-a-sea-of-sequels-140010178.html?src=rss

## Google, OpenAI will share AI models with the UK government

<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uk-competition-watchdog-opens-review-into-ai-models-121559668.html">UK's AI oversight</a> will include chances to directly study some companies' technology.  In a speech at London Tech Week, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-london-tech-week-speech-12-june-2023">revealed</a> that Google DeepMind, OpenAI and Anthropic have pledged to provide &quot;early or priority access&quot; to AI models for the sake of research and safety. This will ideally improve inspections of these models and help the government recognize the &quot;opportunities and risks,&quot; Sunak says.</p><p>It's not clear just what data the tech firms will share with the UK government. We've asked Google, OpenAI and Anthropic for comment.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The announcement comes weeks after officials said they would conduct an initial assessment of AI model accountability, safety, transparency and other ethical concerns. The country's Competition and Markets Authority is expected to play a key role. The UK has also committed to spending an initial £100 million (about $125.5 million) to create a Foundation Model Taskforce that will <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-uk-is-creating-a-100-million-ai-taskforce-143507868.html">develop &quot;sovereign&quot; AI</a> meant to grow the British economy while minimizing ethical and technical problems.</p><p>Industry leaders and experts have called for a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tech-leaders-and-ai-experts-demand-a-six-month-pause-on-out-of-control-ai-experiments-114553864.html">temporary halt to AI development</a> over worries creators are pressing forward without enough consideration for safety. Generative AI models like OpenAI's GPT-4 and Anthropic's Claude have been praised for their potential, but have also raised concerns about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-bard-chatbot-false-information-twitter-ad-165533095.html">inaccuracies</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chatgpt-is-suddenly-everywhere-are-we-ready-180031821.html">misinformation</a> and abuses <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chatgpt-passes-graduate-law-business-exams-210146640.html">like cheating</a>. The UK's move theoretically limits these issues and catches problematic models before they've done much damage.</p><p>This doesn't necessarily give the UK complete access to these models and the underlying code. Likewise, there are no guarantees the government will catch every major issue. The access may provide relevant insights, though. If nothing else, the effort promises increased transparency for AI at a time when the long-term impact of these systems isn't entirely clear.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-openai-will-share-ai-models-with-the-uk-government-134318263.html?src=rss

## 'Immortals of Aveum' first look: A little more magic and this might be wonderful

<p>When I saw the announcement trailer for <em>Immortals of Aveum</em> in the winter of 2022, I was surprised by my own interest in the game. <em>Immortals </em>came from an unproven studio founded four years prior by Bret Robbins, a AAA creative director who most recently built a trio of Call of Duty titles<em>: Modern Warfare 3</em>, <em>Advanced Warfare</em>, and <em>WWII</em>. Ascendant Studios, his independent venture, was partnering with EA on its debut game, a first-person shooter in a militaristic fantasy world. On the surface, it didn’t sound like something I’d be drawn to.</p><p>But <em>Immortals of Aveum</em> caught my eye. Its cinematics were beautiful and the trailer showcased frenetic combat with bright beams of magic, all while actors Gina Torres (<em>Firefly</em>) and Darren Barnet (<em>Never Have I Ever</em>) narrated an epic story of rebellion, political sabotage and dragons. From a first-person perspective, the protagonist’s hand movements were quick and sharp, and they looked like a satisfying build-up to powerful attacks.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="377a6787f9ba41c997e00a90d743ff41"></div><p>With a few months of hindsight, I remain interested in <em>Immortals of Aveum</em> and I think I’ve figured out why. There aren’t a ton of first-person action games that rely on mechanics other than guns — <em>Dishonored</em>, <em>Ghostwire: Tokyo</em> and <em>Hexen </em>come to mind, but it’s a small field overall. That might be one reason <em>Immortals of Aveum</em> stands out as something fresh, but it’s also nice to see a new, AAA-level game that’s single-player and narrative-driven with a contained campaign, rather than an open world of live-service features. Learning more about Ascendant helped, too: Robbins was also the creative director of the original <em>Dead Space</em> and his team included former Telltale Games members, lending weight to the assertation that <em>Immortals of Aveum</em> would center a dense storyline.</p><p>I played a demo of <em>Immortals of Aveum</em> at Summer Game Fest 2023, and it was gorgeous. Its cinematics were particularly impressive: The motion capture was smooth and the character models were finely detailed, with delicate eye markings and layers of gear. The clarity of the cutscenes made it easier to get lost in the dialogue and the ravaged fantasy world of Aveum, even in a short period of time.</p><p>Gameplaywise, I had access to the blue type of magic, which granted me two abilities: a whip that pulled enemies toward me, and a burst of balled-up energy, spammable as fast as my finger could press R2. I also used the Animate ability on a giant rock hand, using a telekinesis-type power to manipulate its fingers and bridge a gap between two cliffside landings. Playing with a gamepad on PC, I found the mechanics to be almost too smooth, with my reticle often sliding beyond my intended targets, but this is something I think I’d get used to after 30 minutes longer with the game. Even with the hyper-lubricated controls, I appreciated the lack of a noticeable aim assist.</p><figure><img alt="Immortals of Aveum" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/b0d6dac0-07e5-11ee-bfed-f16c28f6a561" style="height: 2160px; width: 3840px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">EA</div></figure><p>I didn’t encounter the sheer number of enemies that Ascendant has shown off in trailers for<em> Immortals of Aveum</em>; my hordes maxed out at about eight. But by the end of my play time, I felt like I’d started to learn the rhythm of the game’s combat, and I can see it becoming frenzied — in a great way — with the addition of new magical powers. And, sure, some more enemies.</p><p>The most jarring part of the demo was actually traversing the terrain — there were plenty of craggy mountainsides and rock walls that looked perfectly climbable by modern action-adventure standards, but they weren’t. Maybe I needed to spend more time learning the intricacies of gap-jumping and ledge-grabbing, but I found my character to be slightly less spry than I wanted, unwilling to fully double-jump or pull himself onto platforms. However, the movement restrictions seemed purposeful, and the game wasn’t sluggish by any means: <em>Immortals of Aveum</em> felt more like a puzzle game than a climbing adventure, with a series of locked stone doors and multicolored gems to throw magic at in specific patterns.</p><figure><img alt="Immortals of Aveum" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/b0d6dac1-07e5-11ee-bf53-52514b664585" style="height: 2160px; width: 3840px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">EA</div></figure><p>My demo broke once, when a bug prevented a stone door from opening, and a developer had to get me back on track. I was assured that the game will be in full working condition by launch day, in about six weeks.</p><p>Ascendant Studios is independent, but it’s marketed as a AAA team and it has about 100 employees. <em>Immortals of Aveum</em> certainly looks like a big-budget game; it’s built in Unreal Engine 5 and heading to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and PC on July 20th. I remain intrigued; I'm excited to get my hands on a few more magical powers and see where this world of high-fantasy politics leads.</p><section><img alt="Immortals of Aveum" class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/b0f02f20-07e5-11ee-9b4f-2938476e73f2" style="height: 2160px; width: 3840px;" /></section><p><em>Catch up on all of the news from Summer Game Fest </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/sgf-2023"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/immortals-of-aveum-first-look-a-little-more-magic-and-this-might-be-wonderful-133034089.html?src=rss

## Apple MacBook Air 15-inch review: A bigger screen makes a surprising difference

<p>When Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-finally-announces-the-15-inch-macbook-air-170715355.html">announced the 15-inch MacBook Air</a> last week, it was exactly what you’d expect. Apple simply took the design and internals of the M2-powered Air it announced a year ago and stuck it in a bigger case with a bigger screen. Done and done.</p><p>As such, I went into this review thinking it would be a simple assignment. “It’s a MacBook Air, but bigger.” But that undersells the actual experience of using the 15-inch MacBook Air. See, for a long time, a 15-inch Mac was my ideal computer, from the days of the first titanium-clad PowerBook G4 through the 15-inch MacBook Pro Apple sold a decade ago. Those laptops were powerful and had a screen big enough to use all day, but they were also compact enough to take anywhere. In recent years, though, Apple really leaned into the “Pro” designation, with the price skyrocketing well above $2,000, making it cost-prohibitive for most people.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p></p><p>But the M2-powered, 15-inch Air brings me back to those days. I could easily see using this laptop as my only computer. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/diablo-iv-review-a-mechanically-perfect-romp-through-a-shallow-world-160017353.html">Like the 13-inch model</a>, it’s powerful, has long battery life and a high-quality (if not cutting-edge) display. It’s also surprisingly thin and light, another hallmark of the Air lineup. And with a starting price of $1,299, it’s significantly more affordable than any laptop that Apple has offered with this size screen.</p><p>There are only a few things that the MacBook Air doesn’t have in common with its smaller sibling. Most obvious is the 15.3-inch display with a 2,880 x 1,864 resolution. That works out to 224 pixels per inch, the same as the 13-inch Air. It’s one of Apple’s “Liquid Retina” displays, which has 500 nits of brightness, support for the P3 “wide color” gamut and a modest 60Hz refresh rate.</p><p>It’s missing the niceties you’ll find in the mini LED displays on the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro, including a much more dramatic contrast ratio, support for HDR, slightly more pixels per inch and a 120Hz max refresh rate. But Apple’s standard displays are still very nice, and the MacBook Air’s screen is bright, sharp and entirely pleasant to look at for extended periods of time. I use a MacBook Pro as my daily driver, and while I noticed the lower refresh rate at first, I mostly forgot about it after a short while.</p><figure><img alt="Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M2)" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/6d628a20-087e-11ee-9de7-a3c688a9cf37" style="height: 1600px; width: 2400px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>The rest of the differences between the two Air models are minor. The base 15-inch model comes with the 10-core GPU variant of the M2 to power the bigger display’s extra pixels; the 13-inch has an 8-core GPU by default. The other internal specs are similar for both base models: 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. (The model I’m testing has 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, a configuration that costs $1,699.)</p><p>The 15-inch Air also has a six-speaker sound system with “force-canceling woofers” for improved bass, compared to a four-speaker setup in the smaller model. Apple has been making surprisingly excellent laptop speakers for a few years now, and these also sound very lively and full when playing back music or movies. They’re not nearly as good as the ones in the 16-inch MacBook Pro, but that laptop is significantly thicker and heavier than the Air; that extra space surely helps with resonance and bass. But the speakers in the Air still sound lively and fun to listen to. Cranking the volume up to the max reveals the lack of bass, but I was happy to listen to music at mid-range volume all day long.</p><p>Beyond those things, the 15-inch Air is just a slightly bigger version of the 13-inch model. It has the same relatively meager port selection: just two USB-C ports, MagSafe for power and a headphone jack. The laptop comes in the same four colors (or, more accurately, shades of gray). The keyboard, large trackpad and Touch ID sensor are all excellent, which is true of all Mac laptops at this point. The butterfly keyboard debacle is fortunately a distant memory.</p><figure><img alt="Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M2)" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/6d5bd361-087e-11ee-bfbe-4c83f3196872" style="height: 1600px; width: 2400px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>Unsurprisingly, it sports the same design language that Apple first unveiled with the MacBook Pro refresh a few years ago and then carried over to the Air last year. That means the Air’s formerly iconic wedge shape is gone, replaced with a uniform thickness of less than half an inch, noticeably thinner than the 16-inch MacBook Pro and about identical to the 13-inch Air. Naturally, the 15-inch Air is heavier and bigger in other dimensions, but it still feels extremely thin and also far more portable than either of the MacBook Pro models.</p><p>There’s also a notch in the display for the 1080p webcam — again, the same one we’ve seen on other recent MacBooks. It’s much better than the old camera Apple was using until recently, and I don’t mind trading the notch for an improved webcam. The bezels around the display are otherwise nice and thin: not quite as thin as those on the MacBook Pro, but not thick enough for me to give them a second thought.</p><p>Performance-wise, the 15-inch Air is also essentially identical to the smaller model. Geekbench 5 scores were almost the same as those we got when testing both the 13-inch Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro, both of which also use the M2 chip.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>The same goes for Cinebench R23 and a few others we tried. It's worth noting that while single-core performance is similar to the 14-inch MacBook Pro with an M2 Max chip, multi-core and graphics performance is where the M2 can't quite keep up. That said, for most users, there's plenty of power here.&nbsp;</p><p></p><table><tbody><tr><td><p>Model</p></td><td><p>Geekbench 5 CPU</p></td><td><p>Geekbench 5 Compute</p></td><td><p>Cinebench R23</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>MacBook Air 2023 (M2, 15-inch)</p></td><td><p>1,903/8,928</p></td><td><p>27,870</p></td><td><p>1,595/7,893</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>MacBook Air 2022 (M2, 13-inch)</p></td><td><p>1,907/8,665</p></td><td><p>27,083</p></td><td><p>1,576/7,372</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>MacBook Pro (M2 Max, 14-inch)</p></td><td><p>1,970/15,338</p></td><td><p>71,583</p></td><td><p>1,603/14,725</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Dell XPS 15 2022 (Intel i7-12700H, RTX 3050 Ti)</p></td><td><p>1,680/11,412</p></td><td><p>60,205</p></td><td><p>1,724/13,100</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Performance-wise, the 15-inch Air is also essentially identical to the smaller model.

Of course, that changes a bit if you’re running games or doing more intense tasks like video editing. But my workflow, which consists of dozens of tabs open across multiple Safari windows along with apps like Mail, Slack, Music, Trello, Todoist, Bear and Lightroom, didn’t cause any hiccups. To be fair, these aren’t taxing apps, but dipping into Lightroom to edit some large RAW photos didn’t tax the computer either.</p><p>My only concern is that this brand-new Air is running a chip that’s already about a year old. It’s so powerful that this shouldn’t be a problem for the Air’s target audience, but it’s still something worth considering. If you’re going to spend more than $1,000 on a laptop that you’ll likely own for years, the ideal situation is to start out with the newest, fastest, most future-proof tech that you can afford. The M2, as capable as it is, has been around for a while already. If you want bleeding-edge Apple silicon you might be better served with a MacBook Pro or waiting for the next Air refresh. But given that Apple just released this computer with the M2 chip inside, it’s fair to say the company is in no hurry to release an M3.</p><p>All of the Apple silicon laptops I've tried have had outstanding battery life, and the 15-inch Air is no exception. It exceeded the 18 hours that Apple claims for video playback by about an hour before eventually running out of juice. And while the battery didn't quite last as long during my normal work routine, I still got about 12 hours before I needed a charger. I easily got through the work day and still some power left for some couch browsing and messaging. I think it's safe to say most people can charge overnight and then not worry about plugging in again until their day is over.</p><p>One thing to note on battery, though. Apple offers a compact 35W dual-port charger, which is handy if you want to have your computer charger and another cable right at hand. But after using more powerful chargers for the last few years, this one definitely felt pokey — while I was using the Air, it took about two hours to charge from 45 percent to full while in use. Since Apple gives you the option of swapping in a single-port 70W for no extra charge, I'd recommend that if charging speeds are at all important to you. On the other hand, the battery lasts so long that just charging it more slowly overnight, when speed doesn't matter, is also a fine option.</p><p>As usual, Apple dropped a lot of hyperbole about how the 15-inch Air compares to the “most popular 15-inch Windows laptop running an Intel i7 chip.” The claims are that the Air is much faster, the screen is better, the battery is longer while the laptop itself is thinner and lighter. Apple is being very deliberate about these claims, but the MacBook Air does stack up well compared to some of the most popular 15-inch laptops available.</p><p>Dell’s XPS 15 is one of the best overall laptops out there, and the $1,299 base model has double the RAM and storage of the Air. You can also get one with a discrete graphics card, which can make a big difference in more demanding tasks. But it’s also much thicker, a pound heavier and has a lower-resolution display and webcam. Microsoft’s Surface Laptop 5 is probably a closer comparison for the Air – it’s a little bit thicker and heavier, but more svelte than the XPS 15, and has a higher-resolution screen. But it doesn’t have the newest Intel, and the M2 bests the 12th-generation chip that it does offer.</p><figure><img alt="Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M2)" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/6d57b4b0-087e-11ee-bf7f-c768d0590e4c" style="height: 1600px; width: 2400px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>As you’re surely aware, the 15-inch MacBook Air is little more than a bigger version of the computer that Apple released a year ago. But that’s damming it with faint praise when actually this is one of the best Apple laptops I’ve used in a long time. It does everything the 13-inch MacBook Air does with a noticeably larger screen and only a modest price increase. The only real catch is that I think the RAM and storage in the base model is rather stingy, not an unusual tactic for Apple. The M2 smokes even with only 8GB of RAM, but consider adding more if you want your computer to remain speedy for years to come.</p><p>If you travel a lot, or value portability above all else, by all means get the 13-inch model. But if I were in the market for a new laptop right now, I think the 15-inch Air would be at the top of my list. It’s fast, light and extremely pleasant to use. And getting a big screen in a compact package is just icing on the cake.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-15-inch-review-a-bigger-screen-makes-a-surprising-difference-130033172.html?src=rss

## Former Samsung executive accused of trying to copy an entire chip plant in China

<p>South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol recently declared the chip manufacturing industry to be in an &quot;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/south-korea-vows-support-its-chip-sector-amid-china-us-tensions-2023-06-08/">all-out war</a>,&quot; and the latest developments certainly support that statement. Prosecutors in the Suwon District have indicted a former Samsung executive for allegedly stealing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/president-biden-signs-chips-and-science-act-145820799.html">semiconductor</a> plant blueprints and technology from the leading chipmaker, <a href="http://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=116325"><em>BusinessKorea</em></a> reports. They didn't name the 65-year-old defendant, who also previously served as vice president of another Korean chipmaker SK Hynix, but claimed he stole the information between 2018 and 2019. The leak reportedly cost Samsung about $230 million.</p><p>The defendant allegedly planned to build a semiconductor in Xi'an, China, less than a mile from an existing Samsung plant. He hired 200 employees from SK Hynix and Samsung to obtain their trade secrets while also teaming up with an unnamed Taiwanese electronics manufacturing company that pledged $6.2 billion to build the new semiconductor plant — the partnership fell through. However, the defendant was able to secure about $358 million from Chinese investors, which he used to create prototypes in a Chengdu, China-based plant. The plant was reportedly also built using stolen Samsung information, according to prosecutors.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;It's so serious that it's difficult to compare it in terms of the scale of the crime and the degree of damage with previous individual semiconductor technology leakage cases,&quot; the prosecutor's office said in a statement. &quot;It's a grave crime that could deal a heavy blow to our economic security by shaking the foundation of the domestic chip industry at a time of intensifying competition in chip manufacturing.&quot; Six co-conspirators, including one Samsung sub-contractor, were indicted alongside the lead defendant. These charges follow continued efforts from China to acquire South Korea's technologies across a range of industries and Korea creating stricter punishments for related offenses.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/former-samsung-executive-accused-of-trying-to-copy-an-entire-chip-plant-in-china-121008690.html?src=rss

<p>Meta's Audiocraft research team has just released <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/facebook/MusicGen">MusicGen</a>, an open source deep learning language model that can generate new music based on text prompts and even be aligned to an existing song, <a href="https://the-decoder.com/metas-open-source-ai-musicgen-turns-text-and-melody-into-new-songs/"><em>The Decoder</em></a> reported.

## The Morning After: Xbox Series S gets a key upgrade

<p>The Xbox Series S occupies an interesting space in Microsoft’s gaming lineup, given it can play every current-generation title available for the Series X. It may be significantly less powerful, but it’s also smaller and a lot cheaper, making it a “good enough” option for plenty of mainstream and casual gamers. Now, at 2023’s Summer Game Fest, Microsoft is addressing one of users’ biggest bugbears about the machine, which should make it a lot easier to live with.</p><p>At the event, the company showed off a new “carbon black” <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-series-s-will-be-available-with-1tb-storage-in-black-for-349-on-september-1st-181414018.html"><ins>version of the console with 1TB storage</ins></a>, double what’s presently available. It’s a big deal for owners of the all-digital console since, with just 512GB, the current Series S users are often forced to delete downloaded games or buy a pricey expansion card to make room for whatever’s just landed on Game Pass. The new Series S will be available on September 1st, days before Microsoft’s latest blockbuster release, <em>Starfield</em>.</p><p>– Dan Cooper</p><p><em>The Morning After isn’t just a</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/"><em> newsletter</em></a><em> –  it’s also a daily podcast.

That could put some key Twitter functionality at risk, including the automated moderation platform which combats spam and CSAM.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-has-reportedly-refused-to-pay-its-google-cloud-contract-161936042.html"><strong><ins>Continue Reading. </ins></strong></a></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisofts-open-world-star-wars-game-is-outlaws-coming-to-xbox-series-xs-ps5-and-pc-in-2024-172738697.html"><ins>Ubisoft's open-world Star Wars game is 'Outlaws'</ins></a></h2><h3>The company promised to share gameplay footage later today.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisofts-open-world-star-wars-game-is-outlaws-coming-to-xbox-series-xs-ps5-and-pc-in-2024-172738697.html"><figure><img alt="Promotional logo for 'Star Wars: Outlaws'" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/c1070d70-0907-11ee-9af6-21d17fccdf94" style="height: 372px; width: 625px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Ubisoft / Lucasfilm</div></figure></a><p>Ubisoft's long-awaited <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisofts-open-world-star-wars-game-is-outlaws-coming-to-xbox-series-xs-ps5-and-pc-in-2024-172738697.html"><ins>open-world Star Wars game will arrive in 2024</ins></a>.

## Reddit sees more than 6,000 communities 'go dark' in protest over API changes

<p>The Reddit community’s mass protest over the company’s controversial API changes has started. Thousands of subreddits have “gone dark,” setting their communities private and making their content inaccessible to anyone not already subscribed.</p><p>Some of the site’s most popular subreddits, including r/Music, r/funny, r/aww and r/todayilearned   — each of which has millions of followers — have joined the effort, along with thousands of other communities. The movement has grown significantly in the last few days following CEO Steve Huffman’s AMA with users in which he <a href="https://www.engadget.com/reddit-ceo-will-host-an-ama-on-api-changes-as-thousands-of-subreddits-plan-to-go-dark-193423226.html"><ins>defended</ins></a> the new policies, which will result in popular third-party apps like RIF and Apollo <a href="https://www.engadget.com/third-party-reddit-app-apollo-will-shut-down-on-june-30th-174305150.html"><ins>shutting down</ins></a> for good.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As of <a href="https://consent.yahoo.com/v2/collectConsent?sessionId=3_cc-session_a61098d3-e595-4aa7-9129-f755a7f3ae6f"><ins>last week</ins></a>, the number of participating subreddits was just over 3,000. But by Monday morning, the number had climbed to more than 6,200 communities, according to a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/reddark_247"><ins>Twitch stream</ins></a> tracking the protest. With the blackout, participating subreddits have posted brief messages alerting users that they are protesting the company’s planned API changes. Most have committed to a 48-hour blackout, but at least <a href="http://r/quityourbulshit%20%20r/traa%20%20r/AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA%20%20r/ProgrammerHumor%20%20r/EDM%20%20r/Music%20%20r/LinuxMasterRace%20%20r/MacPro%20%20r/AzerothPorn%20%20r/FlyFishingCircleJerk%20%20r/screenunseen%20%20r/hydrohomies%20%20r/Radarr%20%20r/HelmetHonies%20%20r/mashups%20%20r/Readarr%20%20r/Peglin%20%20r/DrunkBackpacking%20%20r/yurigif%20%20r/Prowlarr%20%20r/AbolishCars%20%20r/ItHadToBeBrazil%20%20r/Lidarr%20%20r/PinegroveBand%20%20r/Steven%20%20r/formerBk%20%20r/BootieMashup%20%20r/Sportsjerseys%20%20r/ModestMouse%20%20r/picsofaudrey%20%20r/traumacore%20%20r/CockMilking%20%20r/Sofas%20%20r/Whisparr%20%20r/BasicIncomeUSA%20%20r/HereInMyCar%20%20r/LittleDickCoalition%20%20r/ULNorCal%20%20r/frenchednames%20%20r/perfecttimings%20%20r/SkiFree%20%20r/Robocup%20%20r/shittyflyporn%20%20r/perfectletters%20%20r/SuperButterBuns%20%20r/PostieBikies%20%20r/CFF%20%20r/FordF150%20%20r/infiniteworldproblems%20%20r/shit2%20%20r/LansingSex%20%20r/FemboyHentai%20%20r/SoftwareEngineering%20%20r/RevancedApp%20%20r/China%20%20r/fo76FilthyCasuals%20%20r/TwoSentenceHorror%20%20r/Strapi%20%20r/Startpages%20%20r/iphone%20%20r/jackwarplanning"><ins>60 subreddits</ins></a> say they plan to protest “indefinitely” until the company walks back its changes. Many are also urging users not to browse Reddit at all. Some have also set up Discord servers to encourage subscribers to stay off of Reddit.</p><p>The backlash against the company’s new API policy kicked off after Christian Selig, the developer behind Reddit client app Apollo, shared that Reddit’s new pricing would cost him as much as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/reddit-app-developer-says-the-sites-new-api-rules-will-cost-him-20-million-a-year-203911487.html"><ins>$20 million</ins></a> a year to keep his app going. The company further angered Apollo fans by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/third-party-reddit-app-apollo-will-shut-down-on-june-30th-174305150.html"><ins>claiming</ins></a> that Selig had “threatened” the company, which the developer promptly refuted with an audio clip of a phone call with a Reddit employee. Huffman then doubled down on the criticism in his AMA last week.</p><p>“As the subreddit blackout begins, I wanted to say thank you from the bottom of my heart to the Reddit community and everyone standing up,” Selig wrote in <a href="https://twitter.com/ChristianSelig/status/1668054706420105222"><ins>a post</ins></a> on Twitter. “Let's hope Reddit listens.”</p><p>Reddit’s users aren’t only upset about the company’s treatment of Selig and Apollo, though, They are also frustrated with losing moderation and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/reddit-says-some-accessibility-apps-wont-have-to-pay-for-its-api-213401412.html"><ins>accessibility</ins></a> features only available via third-party apps. In a message to users, moderators of r/blind said the native Reddit app was so lacking in accessibility that a sighted user had to switch the subreddit private.</p><blockquote><p>If Reddit was a restaurant third party apps are franchises. We can get a burger from Reddit directly or from a franchise. The official Reddit location is at the top of a cliff. Disabled people can't get there. Reddit is charging franchise fees so high nobody else can afford to offer burgers. We, with thousands of other subreddits, have gone dark for 48 hours. We will be back on June 14. Our Discord server remains open. Thank you for understanding; app so bad, vision required to go dark</p></blockquote><p>Reddit’s moderators — who are often quick to point out that they are unpaid volunteers — shared similar. “In many cases these apps offer superior mod tools, customization, streamlined interfaces, and other quality of life improvements that the official app does not offer,” moderators wrote in an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7/an_open_letter_on_the_state_of_affairs_regarding/"><ins>open letter</ins></a>. “The potential loss of these services due to the pricing change would significantly impact our ability to moderate efficiently, thus negatively affecting the experience for users in our communities and for us as mods and users ourselves.”</p><p>For now, it's unclear whether the protest will be able to influence Reddit's leaders. The company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, but has previously defended the new API policy, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/reddit-will-charge-companies-for-api-access-citing-ai-training-concerns-184935783.html"><ins>citing</ins></a> the rise of generative AI companies taking advantage of its data. “We’ll continue to be profit-driven until profits arrive,” Huffman said last week in his AMA.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/reddit-sees-more-than-6000-communities-go-dark-in-protest-over-api-changes-095311637.html?src=rss

<p>Microsoft Game Pass members will soon be able to stream PC games on NVIDIA's GeForce Now, following the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-is-putting-xbox-games-on-geforce-now-in-an-attempt-to-win-over-regulators-184818183.html">announcement of a pact</a> between the companies earlier this year. &quot;This will enable the PC Game Pass catalog to be played on any device that GeForce Now streams to, like low spec PCs, Macs, Chromebooks, mobile devices, TVs, and more, and we’ll be rolling this out in the months ahead,&quot; Microsoft said in a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/06/11/xbox-bright-future-and-how-well-get-there/">blog post</a>.</p><p>It doesn't appear to include the whole catalog, as GeForce Now members will be able to &quot;stream select PC games&quot; from the library, the company wrote. Still, it'll give PC Game Pass subscribers access to what we <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-ge-force-now-ultimate-hands-on-the-enthusiasts-choice-for-cloud-gaming-specs-release-140035365.html">called</a> &quot;the enthusiast's choice for game streaming&quot; thanks to the high performance offered by NVIDIA's latest RTX 4080 cards.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Previously, the companies announced that Microsoft Store would be coming to GeForce Now for purchases. In addition, Xbox games have already come to GeForce Now, starting with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gears-5-is-the-first-xbox-exclusive-to-come-to-geforce-now-130020878.html">arrival of Xbox exclusive <em>Gears 5</em></a> last month.&nbsp;</p><p>In February, Microsoft and NVIDIA struck a 10-year deal to bring games to the GeForce Now service, including Activision Blizzard titles like the Call of Duty series. Microsoft also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-inks-another-cloud-gaming-deal-after-the-uk-blocked-its-activision-takeover-172518808.html">signed an agreement</a> with Spain-based cloud gaming provider Nware in April, and previously inked pacts with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-makes-its-10-year-call-of-duty-pact-with-nintendo-official-091655095.html">Nintendo</a>, Steam, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-is-putting-xbox-games-on-geforce-now-in-an-attempt-to-win-over-regulators-184818183.html">NVIDIA</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-will-bring-call-of-duty-and-its-pc-games-to-a-cloud-service-youve-probably-never-heard-of-171502988.html">Boosteroid</a>, Ubitus and EE to make its games available on those companies' platforms.&nbsp;</p><p>Many of those came about when Microsoft's potential acquisition of Activision Blizzard was being scrutinized by regulators in Europe, the US and elsewhere. Since then, however, UK regulators <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uk-regulator-blocks-microsofts-activision-blizzard-merger-over-cloud-concerns-113517255.html">blocked the deal</a> over cloud concerns, saying it would give Microsoft &quot;incentive to withhold [Activision Blizzard] games from competitors and substantially weaken competition in this important growing market.&quot; With the news that it's  offering its PC Game Pass subscription on GeForce Now, it may still think it can convince regulators to get on board.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/microsofts-pc-game-pass-is-coming-to-nvidias-rival-geforce-now-service-091754446.html?src=rss
