When my father died last August, we scattered his ashes on the recreation ground in his home village, where he first played cricket, and it felt totally fitting, but afterwards I briefly questioned the lack of a grave.

It can\u2019t be many people\u2019s idea of a destination boozer but this changes around 8pm every Wednesday, when the place is enveloped in quiz mania. Local radio presenter Mark Cridland has hosted proceedings for the past seven years. \u201cSome weeks it\u2019s 13 teams, or it might be 30,\u201d he chuckles from a corner table as he runs through a last-minute checklist, tucked away from the rapidly filling room. \u201cWe have our regulars who are hardcore quizzers. They\u2019re the ones who will let me know if I mispronounce a word.\u201d</p><p>Every week, thousands of broadly identical scenes can be observed across the country, from the south coast to the outer fringes of the Highlands; from A-road chain pubs to the most idiosyncratic locals. These offerings range from casual to rabidly competitive. Some, such as Cridland\u2019s, are often both. My trip to Thanet was one of several night-time visitations around the country, trying to chart the future of a very British institution. What sort of health was the pub quiz in? How did it work? And what did the apparently inexorable rise of professionalised pub quiz companies mean for a pastime more traditionally associated with homespun volunteer spirit?</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/12/you-cant-argue-against-a-computer-has-the-pub-quiz-lost-its-soul\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/12/you-cant-argue-against-a-computer-has-the-pub-quiz-lost-its-soul", "date_published": "2023-06-12 10:00:16+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "\u2018Work is therapy\u2019: synth-pop icon Johnny Jewel on David Lynch, Chromatics and near-death experiences", "description": "<p>He was kidnapped as a teenager and later nearly drowned, but these traumas have been poured into an awesomely rich body of music for film, TV and the dancefloor</p><p>\u201cArt is not a hobby, it\u2019s a necessity,\u201d says Johnny Jewel. \u201cI have an unquenchable thirst for sound and tone.\u201d</p><p>Jewel has been thirsty for two decades.
