I used to have a finely tuned satirical radar that instantly identified what's a cleverly crafted sketch and what's woke douchelords being woke douchelords. It's been overworked and is currently on the fritz. As God as my witness, I have no idea if this is real or not. </p><p>Vegans of color taking a stand against \u2014*deep sigh* \u2014 \"white\" veganism.</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cVegans of color unite!\\u201d</div> \u2014 Louder with Crowder Dot Com (@Louder with Crowder Dot Com)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LWCnewswire/status/1668379600492044289\">1686607668</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>When you fail to account for white supremacy in veganism, you get white veganism.<br /><br />We must address the role of white supremacy and the oppression it creates regardless of if we are vegan or not.<br /><br />White veganism focuses solely on animal liberation while ignoring the context of colonization and imperialism and how all of this affects all human beings and the planet.</blockquote><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"4e987\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=25881492&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>There's more, but I felt we could all use a break. Also, rest in peace, Jessica Walter.</p><blockquote>Not all white people vegans are \"white vegans.\"<br /><br />Our veganism must be intersectional, accessible, anti-racist, anti-imperialist, and decolonized.</blockquote><p>I have no idea what most of those words mean.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"d8084\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=25881512&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>This has to be a comedy troupe. Vegans are an easy target. The lack of eating delicious meat leaves them without the energy to fight back. Plus, no upper body strength. Vegans are known for <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/watch-arbys-flips-off-vegans-with-carrot-made-of-meat\" target=\"_blank\">not having a sense of humor</a> and being <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/watch-arbys-flips-off-vegans-with-carrot-made-of-meat\" target=\"_blank\">easily triggered at all the things</a>. Which, I get it. If I went through life <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/vegan-is-suing-her-neighbors-over-wafting-bbq-smells\" target=\"_blank\">never knowing how orgasmic BBQ is to all</a> five senses, I'd be an insufferable prick too. Keeping all that in mind, I can easily see a handful of improv players pulling this off. You're on TikTok and you don't think vegans are woke enough. Now, GO!</p><p>It has to be. The only other alternative is that these are real people trying to make \"white veganism\" a thing. Because being a vegan isn't obnoxious enough. Let's throw gender studies and critical race theory on top of it! There are people who woke up one morning and chose violence by destroying what's left of satire. It makes me sad.</p><p>Then I remember I'm smoking a brisket tomorrow and I feel awesome instead.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

A massive amount of Americans have turned against the Biden agenda to force girls to have to compete against boys in sports if those boys say they are girls. </p><p><a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/507023/say-birth-gender-dictate-sports-participation.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">According to Gallup</a>, 69%...</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"21986\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=34103131&amp;width=980\" />\n</p>\n<p>...transgender athletes should only be allowed to compete on sports teams that match the gender they were born with. And in the case of a lot of boys turns girls in high school, the gender they already went through puberty and had a mediocre sports career with.

But for me, it was Lia Thomas. Prior to mediocre swimmer Will Thomas transitioning into NCAA champion Lia, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/connecticut-girl-sues-state\" target=\"_blank\">all of these stories were local and scattered</a>. Lia made it national. Now people were saying, \"Wait, that girl was a dude, and she...I mean he...I mean...them, are destroying the girls competing? That doesn't seem fair.\"</p><p>Then you saw how EXTREME the pro-trans/anti-girl left had gotten. Lia's teammate Paula Scanlan <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/matt-walsh-lia-thomas-teammate\" target=\"_blank\">says she and the other girl were made clear</a> \"if you speak up about it, your life will be over in some way, you\u2019ll be blasted all over the internet as a \u2018transphobe,\u2019 [\u2026] you\u2019ll never be able to get a job.\"</p><p>Opponent Riley Gaines <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/riley-gaines-congressional-hearing\" target=\"_blank\">TESTIFIED BEFORE CONGRESS</a> that she, as a student, approached officials, who were grown adults, that she and the other girls didn't think it was right for certain \"girls\" to be allowed to walk around the girls' lockerroom with their dicks hanging out. She was told it wasn't a girl's locker room anymore and was now Co-Ed. That was the \"workaround.\"</p><p>And that's before all the major injuries, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/volleyball-player-north-carolina\" target=\"_blank\">like the girl volleyball player who suffered a concussion</a> when a boy who claimed to be a girl spiked the ball in her face.</p><p>Normal Americans know all of this is wrong. A small number of radical progressives enjoy seeing boys take opportunities from girls if those boys now claim to be girls. The rub is that small number of radical progressives run the White House and make up a vast majority of media nacademia.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

Some of the evidence is coming from his former counsel, and these are very damaging statements made against him.

If when Trump told fans he was going to lock Hillary Clinton up when elected president -- which he then didn't do -- he never once said he was going to put her on death row.

At some point, the left has to take the \"L\" over this. They tried lying about the bill. It didn't work. The vast majority of Americans support the bill once they see what it ACTUALLY says, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dont-say-gay-democrat-poll\" target=\"_self\">including a majority of Florida DEMOCRATS</a>. As it turns out, a law preventing teachers' union thugs from promoting sex and gender to kids in 3rd grade and under is popular. Parents don't think it is appropriate for adults to push sex on five-year-olds. </p><p>You would assume a bill critics call \"-phobic\" wouldn't mean people being put on a plantation. But, you know. Intersectionality.</p><p>The other issue, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/naacp-florida-travel-advisory\" target=\"_blank\">and the one that caused the NAACP to declare Florida no longer safe for black people</a>, is that DeSantis' BOE rejected a single AP African American History curriculum. Because <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/andrea-mitchell-apologizes-team-desantis\" target=\"_blank\">while the state believes students should learn</a> about:</p><blockquote><em>Instructional personnel may facilitate discussions and use curricula to address, in an age-appropriate manner, how the individual freedoms of persons have been infringed by slavery, racial oppression, racial segregation, and racial discrimination, as well as topics relating to the enactment and enforcement of laws resulting in racial oppression, racial segregation, and racial discrimination and how recognition of these freedoms has overturned these unjust laws.</em></blockquote><p>And that</p><blockquote><em>Students shall develop an understanding of the ramifications of prejudice, racism, and stereotyping on individual freedoms, and examine what it means to be a responsible and respectful person, for the purpose of encouraging tolerance of diversity in a pluralistic society and for nurturing and protecting democratic values and institutions.</em></blockquote><p>Who is f*cking who (aka, the \"queer studies\" the left tried sneaking in) was not appropriate.</p>\n<p>We will see if the governor and presidential candidate (LET'S GO RON) comments on the actress's derptastic moment today.
