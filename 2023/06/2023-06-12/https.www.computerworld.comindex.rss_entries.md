<p>Mike Rockwell, Apple vice president for the technology development group, says that from the first second of wearing Apple Vision Pro the experience is designed to be “<a href="https://youtu.be/DgLrBSQ6x7E" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">special</a>.”</p><p>Most of the fortunate few who spent time using <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3698690/with-vision-pro-apple-shows-computings-future-but-whos-it-for.html">Apple Vision Pro</a> admit to being stunned by what Apple's built. But where will it be in two years’ time? “Who is it for?” and “Where’s the killer app?” may be among the questions people ask today, but perhaps the answers are easier to see if we zoom out to zoom in.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3699057/what-will-apples-vision-for-apple-vision-be-in-2025.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
