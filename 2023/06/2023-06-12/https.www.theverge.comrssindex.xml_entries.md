  <p id="Cuut37">Many third-party Reddit apps will be shutting down due to the platform’s prohibitively expensive API changes, but I found one app that <em>might</em> survive — and only by dropping a free version of the app and switching fully to a monthly subscription.</p>
<p id="jlmEIJ">In a post on Sunday, the developer of the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=free.reddit.news&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Relay for Reddit app for Android</a> outlined how they might be able to keep the app running in spite of the increased API fees. “There’s no possibility to continue the free version of Relay; a monthly subscription price of $3 (or less) might be achievable,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RelayForReddit/comments/147152b/update_how_the_current_api_changes_would_impact/">the developer, “Dave,” wrote in the post</a>. </p>
<p id="meYhFO">Dave said that there’s “no financially viable way for me to continue to offer a free version of Relay,” which may not come as a surprise given the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/31/23743993/reddit-apollo-client-api-cost">apparent $20...</a></p>

  <p id="DbDw18">Last week I made a pound of pinto beans in my Instant Pot. They were very good beans and I didn’t have to worry about burning them or leaving them unattended to cook like I do when I cook them on the stove. I didn’t have to worry about them exploding like I did with my mom’s ancient pressure cooker as a kid, either. The Instant Pot cooks the beans very well. It cooks quite a few things very well. It's reliable and affordable, and while it sucks at searing, it really does feel like a multipurpose device.</p>

  <p id="Ypy0eR">If you’re a fan of Google’s Pixel lineup and want the best possible camera performance, there’s only been one real choice over the last couple of years: you buy the biggest phone. The Pixel 7 and 7 Pro share the same primary sensor, but the larger device has a superior ultrawide camera (thanks to its wider field of view) and the vaunted telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom. For the upcoming Pixel 8 and 8 Pro, it looks like the company will continue the trend of giving the pricier phone an optical advantage. </p>
<p id="ZAsg3R">Last year, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23399315/google-pixel-7-pro-review-screen-camera-battery-price">telephoto lens was the big story</a>, but in 2023, it’s reportedly the ultrawide camera that’s making a substantial leap — but only in one of the two phones, of course.</p>

  <p id="0OtVcX">When you boot up your Mac, you’ve probably noticed that a number of apps and tools are loading themselves into memory along with the operating system. There are advantages to this — it ensures that your files always stay in sync with the cloud and that certain plug-ins are always available. But there’s value in keeping a balance: having too many programs start up with macOS can be a drag on your system.</p>
<p id="eSW0xh">Not only does it mean your Mac takes longer to get started and ready for use, but auto-starting apps can use up valuable memory space and processor time. It’s important to be selective about what can launch with macOS and what can’t.</p>
<p id="lABtR6">You can control this by using tools and options built into macOS itself — no third-party software...</p>

  <p id="1hBJNO">At its big summer showcase, Ubisoft provided the best look yet at the upcoming <em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em>. To start, a new story trailer gave a better look at the new assassin, Basim, and the 9th century version of Baghdad he’ll be exploring in the game. You can check it out above.</p>
<p id="m0Jhdf">Perhaps more interesting, though, was a deep dive into the gameplay. <em>Mirage</em> is billed as a game that returns to style of the original <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games, which is to say fewer RPG elements, and more focus on parkour, stealth, and, well, assassinations. The gameplay walkthrough showed Basim running and climbing his way through the city, while using tools like a blow dart and smoke bomb to dispatch of enemies as cleanly as possible. Also, he has a very good...</p>

  <p id="fWcaEU"><em>The Division</em> is coming to your smartphone later this year. At its Ubisoft Forward event, the company confirmed that <em>The Division Resurgence</em>, a mobile spinoff of the near-future shooter series, will be launching in fall 2023.</p>
<p id="KZoVE1">As with the previous games in the series, <em>Resurgence</em> is set in a “mid-crisis” version of New York, one thrown into a crisis following an outbreak of a genetically engineered virus known as the “dollar flu.” And like those games, the mobile version is a cross between an open world game, where you can explore the city and take on missions, and a multiplayer experience where you can squad up with friends. Ubisoft describes it as a “true MMO experience.”</p>

It’s available to preorder today priced at $2,199.99 and is expected to ship on June 26th.</p>

Samsung is using its own QD-OLED tech for this monitor, not LG Display’s OLED panels. QD-OLED differs from traditional OLED because it can, at higher brightness levels, produce a more contrast-rich picture.</p>
