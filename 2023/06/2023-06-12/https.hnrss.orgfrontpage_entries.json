That's it. If it can't accomplish that, then to me it is a failure. I watched Reddit go from having high quality discussion in 2008-9 to devolving into the PC meme dumpster it is today [1]. HN still has the highest discussion quality of any \"forum\" I know of, but (1) it can sometimes randomly be very hostile/toxic to new tech, the most glaring example being crypto. (2) HN is basically a single subreddit mostly geared towards tech and startups. It'd be nice to have an equivalent of \"subreddits\"<p>Zsync's version of subreddits are tags. You can tag your posts. Instead of viewing a subreddit for, let's say neuroscience, you view the tag for neuroscience. This eliminates the need to submit the same post multiple times to many different subreddits.<p>The core challenge is incentivizing/rewarding high quality content (I don't believe in censorship). Users can have custom avatars and links to their personal website and Twitter next to their username, which I believe provides a little more incentive to write a more thoughtful comment vs. your post merely showing up next to an anonymous handle with some autogenerated alien avatar (which you're free to still do if you prefer).<p>Anyone who connects an ethereum wallet to their account will also have a (non-invasive) \"Tip\" option at the bottom of their comment, allowing anyone to directly tip commenters cryptocurrency (no middleman taking a cut here), offering a financial incentive. I was thinking of some other ideas to use crypto to reward quality, but I wouldn't want to implement anything that could be gamed or exploited ultimately defeating its purpose. Open to ideas though.<p>In the future, we could use ML to offer options to sort comments in more useful ways, such as by sorting by \"most insightful\". We could determine based on your upvote history the type of content you'd be most likely to enjoy. Anyways I admittedly didn't implement this ML stuff yet, those are just ideas for future improvement.<p>Anyways would love to hear your thoughts. What do you think of this idea, and what would it take to accomplish its mission? Regardless of whether my little project amounts to anything or not, I hope something like this will be made to exist. And thank you HN for not deteriorating in quality even remotely to the extent that Reddit has. It was really sad watching Reddit devolve into what it is today (way before all this recent stuff). We can do better, and now is a better time than ever to shake up the status quo and start envisioning what better platforms for online communities can look like.<p>[1] <a

last few years. Doing a (very) soft launch today, mainly because I want to use it to encourage discussion of alternatives.<p>How non.io works:<p>1. Free to browse, paid to interact.<p>2. Minimum subscription is $2 (though you can choose more). I take $1 to run the servers, everything left gets split evenly between everything you upvote that month.<p>It's a simple model, but I hope it's a better one than the freemium model we've been relying on for the last few years. Fundamentally I feel like any ad-supported network doesn't have alignment between the needs of the users and the needs of the platform, which is what drove me to make this.<p>Because this is a soft launch, if you do subscribe I'd encourage you <i>not</i> to pay for the time being. I'm still testing the distribution algorithm for returning funds - you won't get overcharged or anything, but I just want to guarantee your funds are properly distributed at the end of the month.

DevCycle is a feature flag platform focused on developer experience, speed of delivery and long-term maintainability.<p>To give the platform a shot, anyone can sign up and use DevCycle for free here: <a href=\"https://devcycle.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://devcycle.com</a><p>Here\u2019s a general platform demo video if you\u2019re interested: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZD-pyKGwR4\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZD-pyKGwR4</a><p>Feature flagging is a technique that lets developers switch features on or off in a software application without redeploying it, enhancing testing and rollback capabilities. At their core, feature flagging platforms solve the problem of separating production code deploys from feature releases to users. While DevCycle solves that same general pain, we also aim to solve core problems in developer experience and code maintainability that hold developers back from fully adopting feature flagging into their workflow.<p>In traditional feature flagging platforms, extended flag usage increases code complexity over time. Most engineers with feature flagging experience are worried about the build-up of stale flags and their code being filled with unnecessary conditionals. Dealing with this problem is important because if an engineer is worried about this increasing complexity, they are likely to avoid using feature flags.<p>We came upon this problem when we were building Taplytics, the startup we joined YC with. We experienced it not only from our own struggles with feature flagging and transitioning to continuous deployment but also from our time spent with Taplytics customers who were often on the same journey.<p>Given this experience, we developed DevCycle with a few core differences in how we solve these problems.<p>Features, Not Just Flags: Many in-house and competitive feature flag systems operate on the simple idea that features exist in a binary state - they are either \u2018ON\u2019 or \u2018OFF.\u2019 In reality, software is never this simple. DevCycle treats features the same way you do in every other context, by attaching highly-extensible remote configuration to every feature in your product, allowing multiple flags to be combined under the context of a single feature and configured together.<p>Developer Experience: To get the benefits of feature flagging you need broad adoption by all developers touching a codebase. Our primary goal is to provide the best developer experience possible. Providing tools and integrations so we can get out of developers\u2019 way. For example, to address the problem of long-running feature flags that build up over time, we offer developer-facing features to easily track, detect (deploy pipeline actions), and eventually remove unnecessary technical debt (CLI code cleanup commands).<p>Given that we are building this as a developer-first product, we\u2019d love your feedback on whether our approach better fits your workflow and any other thoughts on our solution. Thanks so much!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36295460\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36295460</a></p>\n<p>Points: 13</p>\n<p># Comments: 3</p>", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36295460", "date_published": "2023-06-12 15:46:48+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "WHO advises against use of artificial sweeteners", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/05/1136667\">https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/05/1136667</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36295427\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36295427</a></p>\n<p>Points: 113</p>\n<p># Comments: 51</p>", "link": "https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/05/1136667", "date_published": "2023-06-12 15:45:15+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Edge sends images you view online to Microsoft", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.neowin.net/news/edge-sends-images-you-view-online-to-microsoft-here-is-how-to-disable-that/\">https://www.neowin.net/news/edge-sends-images-you-view-online-to-microsoft-here-is-how-to-disable-that/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36295364\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36295364</a></p>\n<p>Points: 241</p>\n<p># Comments: 80</p>", "link": "https://www.neowin.net/news/edge-sends-images-you-view-online-to-microsoft-here-is-how-to-disable-that/", "date_published": "2023-06-12 15:40:47+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Show HN: Stable Diffusion powered level editor for a 2D game", "description": "<p>Hey folks, I\u2019ve been working on using control-net to take in a video game level (input as a depth image) and output a beautiful illustration of that level.
