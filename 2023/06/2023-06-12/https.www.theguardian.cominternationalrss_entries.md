<p>Beeny lets us follow her on the whole ‘rollercoaster’ of cancer treatment, urging us to be fearless – without ever shying away from what she fears the most</p><p>You may know Sarah Beeny from her property shows, or her New Life in the Country, and you may see her as a sleeves-rolled-up, can-do, get-on-with-it sort of person. Sarah Beeny vs Cancer cracks open a window into a more personal area of her life. In August 2022, Beeny was diagnosed with breast cancer. At first, she thought she might keep it to herself and not go public with the news, but in this hour-long documentary about her diagnosis and treatment, she explains that she realised making a film about it might help her, and might help anyone else going through it, too.</p><p>The film starts three weeks after Beeny’s diagnosis. She has three lumps in her left breast, she explains, which are grade 3, “the most active type”. Beeny’s mother died of breast cancer at 39 and much of this film sees Beeny exploring her own treatment while comparing it with what her mother went through 40 years earlier. “I’ve spent 40 years waiting to be told I have breast cancer,” she says, while still joking with the camera crew that they didn’t know what sort of film they were letting themselves in for.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/12/sarah-beeny-vs-cancer-review-crucial-and-almost-unbearably-candid">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The problems I experienced at the Champions League final in Istanbul made me wonder – how is Uefa so bad at this?</p><p>The block across from us – full of guests of the potato chip brand Lay’s – all had their phones ready to capture the big moment. Manchester City had just defeated Internazionale <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/10/rodri-breaks-internazionale-resistance-to-seal-manchester-citys-treble-glory">to become European champions</a> and win the treble. Fans around us cried and hugged as Ilkay Gündogan walked up to lift his third trophy in a month. This was the endpoint of a wild journey for the team that I’ve been watching since my first match in 1992. It was, as a football fan, as good as it could ever possibly get, but almost all I could think about was: how the hell can I get some water?</p><p>In an attempt to keep the rival fans apart, beat Istanbul’s impressively stubborn traffic and get everyone to their seats in time, Uefa had insisted that City’s fans start heading to the Ataturk Olympic Stadium, in the far north-west of the city, from as early as 1pm. They were instructed to gather outside a grim “fan park” on the city’s south coast to catch a supposed hour’s shuttle bus to the ground.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jun/12/uefa-ticket-football-match-free-water">Continue reading...</a>

He had already beaten three seeded players, including the explosive world No 9, Fernando González, but greatness awaited. Djokovic stepped on Court Philippe Chatrier for his first quarter-final against Rafael Nadal, the 20-year-old defending champion.</p><p>It was not quite the longest encounter of what would go on to be a 59-match rivalry. Two sets in, Djokovic retired while trailing 6-4, 6-4 with a lower back injury. Afterwards, he said he had learnt from the match that Nadal was hardly unbeatable on clay and if his back had allowed him to serve properly, he would have had his chances.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jun/12/tennis-who-can-stop-djokovic-calendar-grand-slam">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Blending science and the supernatural, high art and gothic horror, Hamad Butt made work that was literally dangerous, in one case sparking fears of a gas leak. He is one of the stars of Tate Britain’s rehang</p><p></p><p></p><p>Last month, Tate Britain’s first rehang of its collection in a decade provoked <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/23/tate-britain-rehang-review-this-is-now-the-museum-where-art-goes-to-sleep">a blizzard of controversy</a>, with detractors railing against the supposedly “woke” prioritising of politics over aesthetics. Regardless, the London gallery clearly saw a need to update their offering to reflect how the story of contemporary British art has evolved – and to encompass the many important players who had previously been left out. Familiar names such as Tracey Emin and Antony Gormley remain, but they are now on an equal footing with less exposed artists such as Donald Rodney and Ingrid Pollard. One particularly exciting addition is the little-known Pakistani-born artist Hamad Butt, whose striking 1990 installation Transmission has been given a whole room<em>.</em></p><p>Created at the height of the Aids epidemic in Europe and the US, Transmission evokes multiple terrors. Donning safety goggles at the entrance, you encounter a darkened space with nine open glass books, lit by UV lamps, arranged in a circle on the floor as if for some cabalistic ritual. Through the eerie glow, an etching looms on each book of a triffid, the giant carnivorous plants that overrun Earth after a blinding meteor shower in John Wyndham’s 1951 sci-fi novel The Day of the Triffids. On the wall, nine cryptic statements pronounce things like: “We have the eruption of the Triffid that obscures sex with death” and “We have the blindness of fear and the books of fear”. The piece explores fears of the foreign invader, of deadly desire (through the distinctly phallic-looking triffid), of literal blindness as well as blind faith, the open tomes recalling a madrasa or a witch’s coven.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/12/hamad-butt-lethal-tate-rehang-evacuation">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Various venues, Liverpool</strong><br />The theme is slavery and colonialism and – from instruments used to measure facial features to a ship made out of soil – these works have an astonishing power</p><p>Beneath the glistening water surrounding Albert Dock in Liverpool, there lies a dark and tumultuous history. But today, beside this water, the sun cascades down on diners, seagulls and a carousel outside Tate Liverpool. Ugo Rondinone’s sculpture of rocks painted in rainbow colours stack up high in a celebratory fanfare. But on entering the first space dedicated to the Liverpool Biennial, darkness and silence descends. The contrast between the festivities outside and the reverence commanded by Torkwase Dyson’s three intimidating structures is breathtaking. Each weighing 750kg, the huge, curved sculptures appear as ships ready to make a voyage. The works stand close to what was Britain’s first commercial wet dock, constructed in 1715 to facilitate the transatlantic slave trade.</p><p>Slavery – or the impact of colonialism – is central to the work in this year’s Liverpool Biennial, which spans eight exhibition venues and five outdoor works. Entitled uMoya: The Sacred Return of Lost Things, it is as much about the horrors of the past as it is about the healing potential of the future. “uMoya” is an isiZulu word that means spirit, soul, breath, air, wind, temper and climate. For this biennial of 35 artists, it refers to the strong winds of Liverpool that made it central to the slave trade but could now be utilised to forge new, healing paths. Curator Khanyisile Mbongwa explains, in the biennial guide, that she is developing a space “to create openings that allow us to imagine our way through the wound, to clear pathways so that we can hold each other with something other than pain.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/12/liverpool-biennial-2023-review-horrors-slavery-colonialism">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With dozens of installations from around the world, the quadrennial returns to bring the Czech capital an extravaganza of performance design</p><p>‘Hello stranger.” This cheery neon greeting, inside one of the pavilions at a former slaughterhouse, welcomes you to the UK exhibit of the Prague Quadrennial. It’s a reminder that, four years after this vast festival of performance design and scenography last took place, a few months before the Covid-19 outbreak, the arts are still beckoning audiences back and adjusting to the pandemic’s impact.</p><p>The quadrennial features dozens of multimedia installations representing productions mounted around the world during theatre’s difficult last few years. But several countries face the future too. Kathrine Sandys and Lucy Thornett, the <a href="https://pq.cz/pq-2023-info/projects-2023/exhibition-of-countries-and-regions/united-kingdom-hello-stranger/">UK exhibit</a>’s curators, encourage visitors to contribute ideas for “a radical reinvention of ways of thinking and working”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/12/prague-quadrennial-stages-design-spectacular-with-a-giant-cat-tiny-flats-and-a-16-legged-theatre">Continue reading...</a>

Media tycoon and Italy’s longest-serving postwar prime minister whose period in power ended in sex scandals, a debt crisis and convictions for tax fraud<br /><p>Silvio Berlusconi, who has died aged 86, dominated the public life of his country in a way no Italian had done since the fascist dictator <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/benito-mussolini" title="">Benito Mussolini</a>. He was the Republic’s longest-serving prime minister. But whereas he was brilliant at winning and holding power, the use he made of it was disastrous. The “Berlusconi decade” – he held power for eight of the years between 2001 and 2011 – will be remembered as a period in which the Italian economy virtually stood still.</p><p>Berlusconi’s influence extended far beyond politics and the economy. It can be argued that he gathered to himself more power than was ever wielded by one individual in a western democracy. At the height of his career he was Italy’s richest man, and there was almost no area of Italian life untouched by his influence. His business empire encompassed property and insurance, debt financing and retail interests. He was the chairman of his country’s league-topping football side.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/12/silvio-berlusconi-obituary">Continue reading...</a>
