<p>AT&amp;T has supported RCS messaging on Android phones <a href="https://www.engadget.com/att-google-messages-rcs-default-174512924.html"><ins>since 2021</ins></a>. But if you <a href="https://forums.att.com/conversations/android/rcs-not-working-for-all-people-since-getting-s22/6216432fbd69402c097b3be6"><ins>ask some of the carrier’s customers</ins></a>, the experience hasn’t always been great, with interoperability between different devices <a href="https://forums.att.com/conversations/android/rcs-not-working-for-all-people-since-getting-s22/6216432fbd69402c097b3be6"><ins>sometimes not working as expected</ins></a>. That’s about to change. Over the weekend, Hiroshi Lockheimer, Google’s senior vice president of Android, tweeted (via <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/att-google-jibe-rcs-messaging/?newsletter_popup=1"><em><ins>Android Police</ins></em></a>) that AT&amp;T is migrating its RCS backend to Google’s own Jibe platform. Per Lockheimer, the change means AT&amp;T customers will get the latest RCS features “instantly.” It should also resolve any lingering interoperability issues between AT&amp;T phones and devices on different networks.</p><div id="3f77aa0a80e64028833cdc72014d1975"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Today I'm excited to share that we're working with AT&amp;T to accelerate adoption of the RCS standard, and that AT&amp;T's default Android messaging will now be via the Jibe platform, so their users will get the latest RCS features instantly.</p>— Hiroshi Lockheimer (@lockheimer) <a href="https://twitter.com/lockheimer/status/1667294052960849920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 9, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>AT&amp;T, Verizon and T-Mobile have been committed to RCS since forming the Cross Carrier Messaging Initiative in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/att-t-mobile-verizon-end-rcs-ccmi-051100280.html"><ins>2019</ins></a>, but it was only after announcing the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/att-t-mobile-verizon-end-rcs-ccmi-051100280.html"><ins>end of that partnership in 2021</ins></a>, and Google becoming more directly involved with pushing the platform, that RCS began finding a foothold in the US. In 2021, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-google-messages-212527575.html"><ins>T-Mobile</ins></a> became the first carrier to commit to preloading Google Messages on its Android devices.

Still, the platform faces a major hurdle. Apple has shown no signs it’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tim-cook-response-green-bubbles-android-your-mom-095538175.html"><ins>interested in supporting RCS</ins></a>, even if Google keeps <a href="https://www.engadget.com/drake-texts-go-green-apple-google-rcs-161802322.html"><ins>bringing up the subject</ins></a>. Until something changes, that means RCS features like end-to-end encryption don’t work when Android users text friends and family members who use iPhones.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/att-starts-using-googles-jibe-platform-for-rcs-messages-220258243.html?src=rss

Judging from the trailer Atlus shared, it's unclear if the remake will incorporate elements from the original's 2008 expanded rerelease, <em>Persona 3 FES, </em>and 2010 PlayStation Portable port, <em>Persona 3 Portable</em>. The latter introduced an entirely new female protagonist that has since become a fan favorite.        <em>&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="868097d48b1542269142018a997de0b7"></div><p>Alongside <em>Persona 3 Reload</em>, Atlus announced <em>Persona 5 Tactica. </em>As the name implies, it's a strategy RPG starring the cast of <em>Persona 5</em>. <em>Persona 5 Tactica </em>will arrive on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and PC on November 17th, with day one availability on Game Pass.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="de2a12b36dd24bf58ce7a7cae5382bbf"></div><p><em>Catch up on all of the news from Summer Game Fest </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/sgf-2023"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/persona-3-reload-updates-a-ps2-classic-for-modern-platforms-in-early-2024-192331128.html?src=rss

<p>Season five of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/overwatch-2/"><em>Overwatch 2</em></a> will arrive on Tuesday, bringing with it updates such as a mythic skin for Tracer, a fantasy theme and a fresh limited-time game mode. However, it feels like a bit of a placeholder as Blizzard is already looking forward to the sixth season, which starts on August 10th.</p><p>The studio is calling this the biggest update to <em>Overwatch 2</em> yet. It'll be called <em>Overwatch 2: Invasion</em> and it will include <a href="https://www.engadget.com/overwatch-2s-long-awaited-co-op-story-missions-will-go-live-in-august-193108073.html"><ins>co-op story missions</ins></a><ins>.</ins> Long-promised hero missions, which were going to feature long-term progression features for all heroes, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/overwatch-2-director-explains-why-hero-missions-were-canceled-211629105.html">are no longer happening</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At the outset, there will be three story missions you can tackle with your friends or other players. You'll be taking on Null Sector, which is destroying cities and abducting innocent Omnics (robots that are living alongside humans following a war). Null Sector has formidable opponents at its disposal, including &quot;the powerful Annihilators and the deadly Stalkers.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>There will be a separate co-op mission in season six, as Blizzard will open up new parts of the Kings Row map that aren't accessible in the competitive modes. You'll &quot;guide the TS-1 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-01-blizzard-overwatch-2-blizzcon-gameplay-trailer.html">push bot</a> on a mission to save Tracer’s friend and the Omnic Underworld from Null Sector forces,&quot; according to <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/06/11/overwatch-2-invasion-game-pass-perks/">an Xbox blog post</a>. This time around, the robot will have its own weapons.</p><div id="fb1024628272455995a42ee379dcf95c"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>Meanwhile, Blizzard has revealed some details about Flashpoint, a new core game mode for player vs. player (PvP) modes such as quick play, competitive and the arcade. At the outset, there will be two maps, which are the largest PvP ones to date. Flashpoint will feature multiple capture points. The aim is to capture three of them before the enemy team does. Once a point is secured, the next one will open up.&nbsp;</p><p>On top of that, Blizzard divulged more about the previously teased Hero Mastery mode. This is a single-player affair that will challenge you to tackle training courses with certain heroes. You'll need to have a solid grasp of a character's weapons and abilities to do well here. You'll be able to see how you measure up against other players on a leaderboard. Hero Mastery courses for some characters will be available in <em>Overwatch 2: Invasion,</em> with more to come in future seasons.&nbsp;</p><p>There will also be another way for you to sharpen your skills without switching to <em>Aim Lab</em>, as the practice range is getting a firing range. You'll be able to practice with any hero and customize the settings.</p><p>Last but not least, Blizzard is trying to entice Game Pass Ultimate members to check out <em>Overwatch 2 </em>with a fresh perk. Starting on August 10th, subscribers will be able to instantly unlock the five most recent heroes (Sojourn, Junker Queen, Kiriko, Ramattra and Lifeweaver) as well as the next addition to the lineup without having to shell out for the premium battle pass, complete in-game challenges or pay for the characters in the in-game store. You'll also get a legendary skin and other cosmetics for each of those heroes as part of the New Heroes Starter Pack.</p><p>Speaking of the next hero, who will be a support, there was a brief tease of them at the end of the trailer. They have a cape and a large weapon, but we'll need to wait a bit longer to learn more about them, their backstory and their abilities</p><p>The <em>Overwatch 2: Invasion </em>trailer is a fresh spark of hope for the game after the disappointing news that Blizzard downsized its player vs. environment ambitions. There'll be a bigger focus on story and lore going forward. In the meantime, as a Mei main, I'm looking forward to her becoming more of a menace in season five thanks to her being able to <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-gb/news/23964413/">further slow enemies down</a>.</p><p><em>Catch up on all of the news from Summer Game Fest </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/sgf-2023"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/overwatch-2s-story-missions-and-new-pvp-mode-will-land-on-august-10th-191905129.html?src=rss

## ‘Towerborne’ is an action-RPG brawler from the makers of The Banner Saga

<p>Stoic Studio, makers of the tactical-RPG Banner Saga franchise, announced a new game today at the Summer Game Fest Xbox Showcase. <em>Towerborne</em> is an action-RPG brawler that appears to be a contrast to the studio’s previous work.</p><p>The game’s fantasy world reveals humanity hiding out in The Belfry, a massive tower overlooking a world overrun by monsters and other strange enemies. Gameplay appears to blend classic co-op brawling with strategy and RPG elements — all with a family-friendly feel. “We really wanted to make a game that we could play with our families, play at conventions — make it a sit-down-and-have-fun kind of experience,” Principal Game Designer Alex Thomas said in a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/06/11/towerborne-is-an-action-rpg-with-a-unique-approach-exclusive-interview/">blog post</a>. “We all love and are inspired by classic beat ’em up games and wanted to make one with persistence, where we can continue to expand the features and the gameplay modes for as long as possible.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Thomas says death for the game’s heroes (known as Aces) is a key element in <em>Towerborne</em>. Instead of dying and respawning as if nothing happened, your hero’s death plays into the storyline. “As an Ace, you’re a special force for good because you’re able to go out and face the most dangerous stuff, die, and then come back,” Thomas said. “We didn’t want to just gloss over it like a normal gameplay thing, but instead ask what that would be like for a group of people experiencing it. You’re not just doing it because you’re some kind of superhero, you’re doing it because you’re supporting this whole civilization during something of a cataclysm.”</p><figure><img alt="Screenshot from &#x002018;Towerborne,&#x002019; featuring co-op brawler gameplay in a dark dungeon" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/f6045e80-0888-11ee-afde-69d313161d5c" style="height: 1080px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Stoic Studio / Xbox</div></figure><p><em>Towerborne</em> is a seasonal game, and the developers plan to add new content over time — while continuing to unfold the overarching narrative. “The premise that we’ve created revolves around how you can do a seasonal game that doesn’t feel artificial,” Thomas says. “How can you make a story where the content updates and the changes that happen to the gameplay feel like they’re intertwined with the world?”</p><p>Towerborne is an Xbox-published title that will arrive in 2024 on Xbox Series X / S, Xbox Game Pass and PC via Steam.</p><div id="03e9a77c2729434db21b0d686d8a5f50"></div><p><em>Catch up on all of the news from Summer Game Fest </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/sgf-2023"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/towerborne-is-an-action-rpg-brawler-from-the-makers-of-the-banner-saga-185826861.html?src=rss

<p>Who doesn't love a good Victorian era-adjacent dystopia? If you're a fan of the Dishonored or Bioshock universes, <em>Clockwork Revolution</em> from inXile entertainment could be right up your cobblestone alley.&nbsp;</p><div id="a8ff286a147c4f4c80da63b2ca12b7b6"></div><p>Set in the steampunk metropolis of Avalon, <em>Clockwork Revolution</em> pits players against the powers that be — and the secrets they're trying to conceal.

It'll be up to you to use her own Chronometer against her, undoing the temporal damage she has wrought. But beware, your own past actions will have very real consequences when you return to the present.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The game is still in early development and the action we saw during the Xbox event was all from pre-alpha builds.

<p>In 2016, Japanese publisher Atlus formed Studio Zero, a development team made up of many of the people who have steered the Persona series since its breakout release in 2006. Now, nearly eight years after that announcement, the company has shared a first look at <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio, </em>the studio's first project.&nbsp;</p><div id="6bd93d61814a4bc487df92b19bebb9cd"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>Many of the leading creatives who worked on <em>Persona 5, </em>including game director Katsura Hashino and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-persona-5-4-3-fes-2-pq-dancing-arena-soundtracks-104349652.html">composer Shoji Meguro</a>, were involved in the creation of the game. Structurally, <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> looks like it borrows more than a few elements from the Persona series. There's an overworld for players to explore, and the turn-based combat looks reminiscent of systems employed in past Shin Megami Tensei games, though everything takes place in a fantasy setting instead of a modern-day school. Persona fans will have to wait until next year to see what Hashino and company have been working on all these years. <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio </em>will be available on Xbox Series X/S and PC.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Catch up on all of the news from Summer Game Fest </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/sgf-2023"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/metaphor-refantazio-is-a-fantasy-rpg-from-the-team-behind-persona-5-183345120.html?src=rss

After Nicolas Cage showed up at the opening keynote to discuss his role in <em>Dead by Daylight</em>, Keanu Reeves appeared at the Xbox Games Showcase to present the trailer for <em>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty.</em></p><p>Reeves reprises his role as Johnny Silverhand in the expansion, which includes another big name <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-dlc-2023-idris-elba-040650842.html">in the form of Idris Elba</a>. <em>Phantom Liberty</em> sees Johnny and V undertaking &quot;a dangerous spy mission,&quot; Reeves said, with Elba playing a secret agent. The expansion will take you to Dogtown, a new area of Night City, where you'll be tasked with rescuing the president of the New United States of America. &quot;Expect a massive expansion. Twists, secrets and plenty of stuff to do,&quot; Reeves added.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The trailer features the voice of a new character who says they are aware of the ticking timebomb in V's head (no spoilers for those who haven't played the main game) and that they can save the protagonist's life. It seems that the price of salvation is extracting the commander in chief.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Phantom Liberty </em>is shaping up to be an intriguing continuation of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>'s story. Let's hope the debut of the expansion goes <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cyberpunk-2077-glitch-penis-breasts-170449946.html">much more smoothly than the debut of the original game</a>. We'll find out when <em>Phantom Liberty </em>drops on September 26th.&nbsp;</p><div id="e5698e0ee8d14e818811d3596e170261"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p><em>Catch up on all of the news from Summer Game Fest </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/sgf-2023"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-will-take-you-back-to-night-city-on-september-26th-181652972.html?src=rss

<p>Xbox Game Studios CEO Phil Spencer announced a new Xbox Series S edition today at Summer Game Fest. The new console variant will provide 1TB of storage (double the previous amount) in a sleek “carbon black” colorway. As the company notes, its September 1st launch means it’s “just in time for Starfield,” the highly anticipated game that arrives on September 6th.</p><p>“Whether you’re looking to upgrade from your current console or are new to Xbox, the Xbox Series S — 1TB offers you another option within the Xbox family of devices,” Xbox Senior Marketing Manager Bree Adams said today in a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/06/11/xbox-series-s-1tb-black/">blog post</a>. In addition, it says its carbon black color is “the same sleek, modern matte finish” as the Xbox Series X and Xbox Wireless Controller. “This console features the same next-gen speed and performance of our 512GB Series S, now with double the storage so you can download even more of your favorite games to your console where they’ll be ready to play when you are.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You can pre-order the console later today from <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5f41950e-8ca3-4481-8466-a22b28b80e32&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Xbox&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI1ZjQxOTUwZS04Y2EzLTQ0ODEtODQ2Ni1hMjJiMjhiODBlMzIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueGJveC5jb20vZW4tVVMvY29uc29sZXMveGJveC1zZXJpZXMtcy9jYXJib24tYmxhY2siLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjkxMjUxNTcwLTc5YmYtNDkyZC05MmU1LWQ3NWQ2NTVhNjdjNyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAASyyZF_kJrYhoashJ9pt8QkSX7TYS3YrJ8l41R2FwTLj&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fconsoles%2Fxbox-series-s%2Fcarbon-black">Xbox</a> and the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=67071605-d4df-494e-8d9c-c9c236b8bb38&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Microsoft&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NzA3MTYwNS1kNGRmLTQ5NGUtOGQ5Yy1jOWMyMzZiOGJiMzgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWljcm9zb2Z0LmNvbS9lbi11cy9kL1hib3gtU2VyaWVzLVMtMVRCLUJsYWNrLzh6Y2JndHQyOWg5YyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOTEyNTE1NzAtNzliZi00OTJkLTkyZTUtZDc1ZDY1NWE2N2M3In0&amp;signature=AQAAAfepMbsGhZx5J2inD7FC4Krqx6k_PS_t2rYfl4GnNMkF&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2FXbox-Series-S-1TB-Black%2F8zcbgtt29h9c">Microsoft Store</a>.</p><p><em>Catch up on all of the news from Summer Game Fest </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/sgf-2023"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/xbox-series-s-will-be-available-with-1tb-storage-in-black-for-349-on-september-1st-181414018.html?src=rss

<p>Yakuza fans have a busy 2023 and 2024 ahead of them.

The sequel picks up after the events of 2020's <em>Yakuza: Like a Dragon. </em>The trailer Sega shared on Saturday features protagonist Ichiban Kasuga, who finds himself naked on a Hawaiian beach with no recollection of how he got there. The usual hijinks ensue before Ichiban realizes what's going on and tries to shield himself.

<p>It's been a while since our last look at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hellblade-2-senuas-saga-gameplay-trailer-first-013757756.html"><em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II</em></a>, but Microsoft made sure to include it in the Xbox Games Showcase. The sequel finally has a release window too: it's coming to Xbox Series X/S and PC in 2024. Naturally, Game Pass subscribers will have access to it from the jump.</p><p>The latest trailer opens with Senua crawling through a narrow opening into a vast cave. It only takes a few seconds for things to become a little unsettling, thanks to eerie whispers and moving walls. The new clip of <em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II,</em> which is being built in Unreal Engine 5, is beautifully detailed, with light reflecting off of a pool of water and bouncing around the cave. For what it's worth, Microsoft <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=89f68c82-f255-44fa-8db9-03fec996b93a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YouTube&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4OWY2OGM4Mi1mMjU1LTQ0ZmEtOGRiOS0wM2ZlYzk5NmI5M2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1uUnFMRENCeFcwNCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOTI3YjA2NDUtZDEyNi00YjQwLTgxM2EtNzVjODc3N2QwN2IyIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAW1Kz0bxAYPwtLkUFEovf7RXnVIkC0LS1-HvC2cpiU6K&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DnRqLDCBxW04">says</a> the footage was captured on an Xbox Series X.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="c6eb7cd5b8c545218138fe07bc079ee1"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p><em>Catch up on all of the news from Summer Game Fest </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/sgf-2023"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-will-arrive-in-2024-175240445.html?src=rss

## Rob banks with reckless abandon in 'Payday 3' on September 21st

<p>We got our first glimpse at gameplay from the newest entry in the long-running Payday game series during the Xbox Games Showcase at Summer Game Fest Sunday. Starbreeze Studios may have assumed the franchise's helm from Overkill, but it looks like Payday 3 will deliver the same fraught and frenetic first person shooting that fans have come to expect.&nbsp;</p><div id="43b9170da06940bc80a308946224632b"></div><p>In the demo at Sunday's showcase, a familiar-looking quartet of gunmen sets about taking over and looting a neighborhood bank through the application of aggressive intimidation tactics, a variety of high tech gadgets and a whole lot of downrange fire. Gameplay mechanics like hostage-taking (which previously allowed robbers to trade in captured civilians after for taking too much damage and being &quot;arrested&quot;) appear to still be very much a part of the new title. <em>Payday 3 </em>arrives on September 21st for Xbox X|S (and presumably other platforms as well).&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Catch up on all of the news from Summer Game Fest </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/sgf-2023"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/rob-banks-with-reckless-abandon-in-payday-3-on-september-21st-174340939.html?src=rss

<p>Obsidian Entertainment is finally ready to show us a little more of <em>Avowed</em>, its forthcoming first-person fantasy RPG. At Xbox’s SGF showcase, we got to see a barrage of magical spells, battle dynamics, and all kinds of mythical beasts you’re likely to face. Interestingly, you'll be able to wield swords and guns in addition to magical incantations. Like previous Obsidian games, companions will feature heavily. According to Feargus Urquhart, Studio Head,  your first companion will be Kai, a “Coastal Aumaua” and apparently one of the only friendly faces you’ll come across.&nbsp;</p><p>The game is set in the same universe as the crowdfunded <em>Pillars of Eternity,</em> so expect to see more playful writing and storytelling. You’ll play as an envoy of Aedyr,  investigating rumors of a plague. From there, it seemingly all goes further downhill. With the tagline of “Forge your destiny”, the trailer hints that you can choose to be a good or (very) bad guy. It looks like it may scratch that Elder Scrolls itch, until <em>Elder Scrolls 6 </em>finally shows itself.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Avowed</em> is set to launch in 2024.</p><div id="9f4ed3d820f04e54a116bbe13dac0c78"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p></p><p><em>Catch up on all of the news from Summer Game Fest </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/sgf-2023"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/obsidian-fantasy-rpg-avowed-release-date-sgf-2023-174259416.html?src=rss

<p>Indie studio Thunder Lotus announced a game today that invites you to “Face the Wrath of God.” <em>33 Immortals</em> is the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-relaxing-video-games-140048572.html"><em>Spiritfarer </em>developer’s</a> new co-op action / roguelike that supports up to 33 players.</p><p>“Pick-up and raid, cooperate to survive hordes of monsters and rise above the Almighty,” the title’s description reads. The game’s trailer shows 33-player co-op rendered with an art style that reminds me of old <em>Space Ghost</em> cartoons (meant as a compliment). However, the somewhat retro appearance may have made it easier for Thunder Lotus to render 33 simultaneous co-op players along with enemies and its dungeon-crawling environment.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Thunder Lotus says <em>33 Immortals</em> will be available on Game Pass, Xbox Series X / S and the Epic Games Store in 2024.

## 'South of Midnight' is a Southern Gothic monster adventure from Compulsion Games

<p>Compulsion Games is back with a new project called <em>South of Midnight</em>, a third-person action adventure set in an original world of magic, monsters and giant, blues-playing skeletons. The game's debut trailer is a cinematic snippet introducing the protagonist, a young woman named Hazel, as she attempts to reason with an immortal specter on a dark dock. Hazel is hunting a monster — or, it's hunting her, as the trailer goes on to show — and she can wield bright threads of magic.&nbsp;</p><div id="0f43f6593a6149dcb6abea784e802a42"></div><p><em>South of Midnight </em>is in development for Xbox Series X/S and PC, including a Steam release, and it'll come to Game Pass on launch day — whenever that may be. Compulsion Games is the Canadian studio behind <em>We Happy Few</em> and <em>Contrast</em>, and it was acquired by Xbox in 2018.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>South of Midnight</em> is set in a fictional town in the southern United States and the game is infused with magical realism. It's a Southern Gothic love letter of sorts, creative director David Sears said on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/06/11/south-of-midnight-interview-details/">Xbox Wire</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The magic Hazel practices is called Weaving and it represents the game's central mechanic, used for combat and to travel around the world. Hazel is a &quot;protector&quot; from the small, fictional town of Prospero, and it's her job to not only hunt supernatural creatures throughout the South, but to repair the rips in reality that are letting the beasts in. The monsters are based on Southern folklore, and blues, gospel and folk music plays a big part in the game.</p><p>Hazel is a young Black woman, and Sears noted that this description, &quot;unfortunately, is still pretty unique for video games&quot; when it comes to protagonists.</p><p>He continued, “To tell the story of a Black woman in this setting creates another level of complexity that the team had to meet with curiosity and empathy. The approach to this had to start by having just proper representation on the team, ensuring that we had Black women and women of color on our narrative team is key for understanding and writing Hazel’s voice.”</p><p><em>Catch up on all of the news from Summer Game Fest </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/sgf-2023"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/south-of-midnight-is-a-southern-gothic-monster-adventure-from-compulsion-games-173100633.html?src=rss

<p>Ubisoft's long-awaited open world Star Wars game will arrive in 2024. The publisher announced <em>Star Wars Outlaws </em>on Sunday during Microsoft's Xbox and Starfield Direct showcase with a cinematic trailer that introduces fans to the game's Han Solo-like protagonist, Key Vess. Ubisoft is billing <em>Outlaws</em> as the first-ever open world Star Wars game — though it's worth noting many past games in the franchise, including the recently released <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-wars-jedi-survivor-and-the-year-of-disappointing-pc-ports-141551209.html"><em>Jedi: Survivor</em></a><em>, </em>feature open world elements. Ubisoft first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-massive-star-wars-game-142056025.html">teased <em>Outlaws</em> in 2021</a>, noting at the time that Massive Entertainment, the studio behind <em>The Division 2</em>, was creating the game inside of its in-house Snowdrop engine. The publisher promised to share gameplay footage from <em>Outlaws </em>during its Ubisoft Forward showcase on June 12th. Ubisoft will release <em>Star Wars: Outlaws </em>on Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5 and PC.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="9e91c4b881f54b8cae4ae46a0d53f679"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Meet cunning scoundrel Kay Vess, in Star Wars Outlaws, the first-ever open-world Star Wars game. <a href="https://t.co/4BdFGJ6w60">pic.twitter.com/4BdFGJ6w60</a></p>— Star Wars (@starwars) <a href="https://twitter.com/starwars/status/1667942084001792002?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 11, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p><em>Catch up on all of the news from Summer Game Fest </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/sgf-2023"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ubisofts-open-world-star-wars-game-is-outlaws-coming-to-xbox-series-xs-ps5-and-pc-in-2024-172738697.html?src=rss

## Twitter has reportedly refused to pay its Google Cloud contract

<p>More platform instability could be in Twitter’s near future. In 2018, Twitter signed a $1 billion contract with Google to host some of its services on the company’s Google Cloud servers. <a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/twitter-stiffs-google"><em><ins>Platformer</ins></em><ins> reports</ins></a> Twitter recently refused to pay the search giant ahead of the contract’s June 30th renewal date. Twitter is reportedly rushing to move as many services off of Google’s infrastructure before the contract expires, but the effort is “running behind schedule,” putting some tools, including Smyte, a platform the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-21-twitter-acquires-online-safety-company-anti-abuse-effort.html"><ins>acquired in 2018</ins></a> to bolster its moderation capabilities, in danger of going offline.</p><p>If Twitter can’t migrate the system to its own servers before the end of the month, <em>Platformer</em> suggests a shutdown would greatly impact the company’s ability to combat spam and child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Before Saturday, Smyte had been already showing signs of strain, following Elon Musk’s deep cuts to Twitter’s workforce. In December, Musk reportedly asked Twitter’s trust and safety team why the automated system hadn’t caught a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-blue-verification-impersonation-disaster-203656712.html"><ins>Twitter Blue user</ins></a> who had been impersonating him to pump a crypto scam. The team told Musk the system had been unstable for a week, crashing “at least once a day.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Platform instability has been a hallmark of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-hit-with-mass-resignations-after-elon-musk-hardcore-ultimatum-004304057.html"><ins>Twitter 2.0</ins></a>. In February, many of the platform’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-tweet-daily-limit-direct-messages-broken-224453625.html"><ins>core features</ins></a> went down on more than one occasion. More recently, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ron-desantis-cant-announce-hes-running-for-president-because-twitters-servers-are-kind-of-melting-222437047.html"><ins>trouble announcing his bid</ins></a> for the Republican presidential nomination after Twitter Spaces could not handle the influx of people who wanted to listen to the broadcast. If Twitter is in fact planning to stiff Google, it wouldn’t be the first time the company has ghosted on a contract. At the end of last year, California Property Trust, the owner of the building that houses Twitter headquarters, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-sued-for-not-paying-san-francisco-office-rent-165530970.html"><ins>sued the company</ins></a> for failing to pay rent.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/twitter-has-reportedly-refused-to-pay-its-google-cloud-contract-161936042.html?src=rss

<p>You get free stuff, you get free travel, you get the nifty cool title of "brand ambassador," what's not to love about being an internet influencer? There's the consequences, for one. Not even just the warranted consequences of your actual actions, mind you, but also those arriving unbidden based on the perception of your actions by your audience — and those can be two markedly different things bearing entirely disparate social costs.

Copyright © Stephanie McNeal, 2023.</p><hr /><p>On January 28, 2020, Shannon and her kids were home alone. Dallin was on a work trip. Her youngest child, London, was only six weeks old and her son Brooklyn had recently broken his leg. That night, she found herself unable to produce any breast milk. She was taking medication that made her supply decline. When she realized she had no formula or saved breast milk, she grew desperate to feed her hungry baby but didn’t want to rouse all her kids to bring them to the store with her. After calling some friends and neighbors, around two a.m. she called 911.</p><p>She knew the officer who responded. When we were wandering the neighborhood on my “Mormon blogger tour,” we even saw him driving by. According to Shannon, the police officer usually posts up on their street and stays there all night waiting for a call. It’s kind of funny, she says, because there’s not much going on in Alpine, so he spends many nights just chilling. Shannon often chats with him when she goes to get her mail.</p><p>So, when she began to rack her brain for who may be up at two in the morning, she immediately thought of the police officer.</p><p>“It didn’t even faze me in a way,” she said. “I was like, ‘I know who’s awake!’”</p><p>The officer came through for her, buying baby formula and delivering it to her house in the middle of the night. Shannon was grateful to him and decided to share the saga on her Instagram Story.</p><p>In Shannon’s mind, the story was both her typical, Sandler-esque goofy fare (silly her, ending up in this situation) and also a feel-good story about a nice cop doing good in her community. She never expected the story to go viral. However, it was catnip for local news stations like KSL in Utah. (Local news loves a “good cop doing a good deed” story, which is controversial, to say the least.)</p><p>The story then spread like wildfire. Shannon was featured on CNN (“As a mother of five young children, Shannon Bird said she considers herself somewhat of a pro at the baby-raising game,” the story reads) and outlets as far away as Chicago and the UK.</p><p>At first, the attention from the media was kind of cool. Shannon described it as a “whirlwind,” ticking off all the shows that contacted her and excitedly telling me she got a free trip to New York to do interviews. She had producers “pounding on [her] door” asking her for exclusives. For a minute, everyone seemed to want to talk to her.</p><p>Then came the backlash. Online, Shannon was painted as the epitome of a clueless white woman, using her privilege to call upon law enforcement as her personal errand boy. Many questioned how a mother of color would have been treated by police in this situation (probably very differently). People called Shannon a neglectful mother, pathetic, and an attention seeker, and accused her of perpetrating a publicity stunt.</p><p>In retrospect, Shannon says she didn’t really think about the implications of what she was posting. In her mind, she wasn’t taking resources away from her larger community. She figured her local cops likely were not out responding to a crime in the middle of the night.</p><p>“I was like, ‘Wait, you’re the ones bringing race into this, I didn’t think it was a racist thing at all.’ That’s just because I really am color-blind I didn’t know my white privilege, I guess,” she said.</p><p>This decision to post about the cop and the formula has had a profound impact on every aspect of Shannon’s life since and has radically changed her perspective on both her life and her career as an influencer. It’s constantly on her mind. Even two years later, in January 2022 when I visited her, she brought up her 911 call within the first ten minutes of my arrival and referred to it constantly afterward.</p><p>The most serious and devastating impact it had on the Bird family was the real-world one. Shortly after the incident went viral, Shannon started getting more hate than she had ever before online. Then, things started to show up at her house. Her mailbox filled up with empty formula cans, though she had no idea how anyone had found her address to send them to.</p><p>Shannon wondered if the strange missives were coming from haters online or people in her community. She grew worried. Did everyone in her neighborhood know about the formula thing? What about the other parents at her kids’ school? Everywhere she looked she felt judged. More than ever, Shannon felt like the walls of Alpine were closing in on her.</p><p>Then, she said, Child and Family Services showed up at her house. Someone had called in a tip that the Bird children were in danger, and the agency needed to do a full investigation to clear the charges. Her kids had to be interviewed. Shannon was relieved when the officers seemed to be confused as to why they had been called to the Birds.</p><p>“You live in a seven-thousand-square-foot house,” she said they told her. “Your kids are eating takeout sushi right now. Like, what are they talking about?”</p><p>While she can make little jokes about it occasionally, Shannon was extremely traumatized by the DCFS visit. Dallin, on the other hand, is so easygoing that she said he was never really concerned when DCFS came, calling the whole saga “ridiculous.”</p><p>That’s his attitude to most things Shannon posts online, including the formula saga. When I asked him if online criticism ever bothered him, he shook his head with a laugh. Even he doesn’t really understand how he’s able to not let it bother him.</p><p>“You know, I just don’t care,” he said.</p><p>Sure, he may wish she didn’t post every single thing that comes into her head, but he long ago made his peace with the fact that he can’t control what Shannon wants to do. He is capable of tuning out the opinions of strangers, “You have to get to a point where, like, it’s funny. It’s funny to you,” he told me. “If you really, really care, then you can’t do this,” he said.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-swipe-up-for-more-stephanie-mcneal-portfolio-143057280.html?src=rss
