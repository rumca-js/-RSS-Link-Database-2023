<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/frostpunk-2/">Frostpunk 2</a> developer 11 Bit Studios has announced that the game will launch in 2024 for PC, and has debuted a new trailer for its city-building sequel. Set 30 years after the original game, which saw humanity almost wiped out by a new ice age, one of the last strongholds on the planet has managed to survive through the big freeze and a new era of expansion has begun.</p><div>          </div><p>Like the first game and its expansions, Frostpunk 2 will focus on taming a world covered in ice, as the drive to expand beyond the borders of The City will require vast supplies of oil to keep the fires going. People have changed, but the bonding instinct of survival has faded away, and there'll be some hard decisions to make if you want to see your community grow and survive.</p><p>There haven't been too many updates on Frostpunk 2 since it was first announced in 2021 with a chilling CG trailer, but at the time, the game's co-director Jakub Stokalski did mention that 11 Bit Studios was aiming to create more than just a mere sequel. With a bigger team working on the sequel, Stokalski said that the studio is now able to focus on delivering a follow-up that has a grander scale and improved design.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-frostpunk-2-trailer-teases-a-reborn-oil-rush-release-window-set-for-2024/1100-6515002/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Mortal Kombat 1 Hands-On Preview Reveals More Core Gameplay Twists Than You Might Think

<p dir="ltr">Mortal Kombat 1 is being billed as a fresh start for the franchise's story. The first two trailers--which highlight the Elder God Liu Kang's brand-new vision for the world he protects--give us a taste of these changes: Scorpion and Sub-Zero are now blood brothers, Mileena is the ruler of Edenia as opposed to her sister Kitana, and the list goes on. After getting some hands-on time with MK1 at Summer Game Fest Play Days, it's become clear the "fresh start" also applies to the game's core mechanics, as a few new elements add a layer of creativity that was sorely lacking in MK11.</p><p dir="ltr">This new creative push starts with an emphasis on air combos, where each character can now follow up on an opponent after certain launchers and continue their offense push. Most air combos are two or three extra hits, but some of them will bounce an opponent off of the wall or the ground--for example, as Sub-Zero, I was allowed to continue a combo once he landed from his jump and keep piling on damage.</p><p dir="ltr">Every character in the game has new aerial tools like these, and some of the results were jaw-dropping. Kitana has a notably flashy sequence where she's able to use her fan to not only launch the opponent, but keep them in the air to give her an extra beat to attack. The new focus on aerial attacks opens up a lot of new possibilities, but when paired with the other major addition to the fighting scheme, things get really wild.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-hands-on-preview-reveals-more-core-gameplay-twists-than-you-might-think/1100-6515083/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1639/16394322/4151205-adsfcopy.png" /><br /><h3><p>Microsoft's major event of the year, the Xbox Games Showcase 2023, has officially come to a close. And though the studio placed a lot of emphasis on its upcoming sci-fi RPG, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starfield/">Starfield</a>, that certainly doesn't mean it neglected to show off several new titles and closer looks at highly-anticipated follow-ups.</p><p>In addition to Starfield, the Xbox Games Summer Showcase featured the reveal of a Ubisoft's Star Wars: Outlaws, Compulsions' South of Midnight, and a spiritual successor to Capcom's Onimusha in Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess. We also saw cinematic trailers for Fable and Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, two titles that have been in development at their respective studios for quite some time.</p><p>Perhaps the most surprising event at the showcase was showcase was Japanese developer Atlus' large presence, as the studio revealed three new titles: Persona 5 Tactical, Personal 3 Reload, and Metaphor: ReFantazio. We also saw a bit <em>too much </em>of Like a Dragon protagonist Ichiban in the teaser for Like a Dragon 8: Infinite Wealth.</p><p>Xbox also highlighted up-and-coming studio Thunder Lotus' newest game, 33 Immortals, before showing gameplay of Payday 3 and the steampunk-inspired Clockwork Revolution. Lastly, we can expect some cool DLC headed our way with Sea of Thieves free Monkey Island expansion, as well as Cyberpunk-2077's Phantom Liberty addition, which gives players even more Keanu Reeves, Idris Elba, and a massive new part of the city to explore. For more information on all of these titles, here's a roundup of the Xbox Games Showcase's biggest titles.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Fable</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1639/16394322/4151128-summergamesfest2023-xboxgamesshowcase%2Bstarfielddirect%28sunday%2929-51screenshot.png" /><br /><h3><p>A new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fable/">Fable</a> is coming from Playground Games. Based on the new trailer from Xbox Games Showcase, it looks to be a reboot of the series, and actor Richard Ayoade is involved in some capacity. There are still plenty of unknowns, but it looks like you will play as a physically small person in a world full of giants. It's been a long time coming, as the Fable series has been dormant for years, and few could have predicted that the studio known for Forza Horizon would be taking up the mantle. But here we are. The Xbox Games Showcase trailer didn't give us a release date, so it's a safe bet that the new Fable won't be here soon. But what we do know is that it's confirmed for Xbox and PC, and will be available on Xbox Game Pass.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fable-unveiled-at-xbox-showcase-with-impressive-new-trailer/1100-6514860/">Fable Unveiled At Xbox Showcase With Impressive New Trailer</a></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>South of Midnight</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1639/16394322/4151129-summergamesfest2023-xboxgamesshowcase%2Bstarfielddirect%28sunday%2932-16screenshot.png" /><br /><h3><p>Compulsion, the studio behind We Happy Few, is taking a trip to the American South in its newest game, South of Midnight. While not much is known about the upcoming title and the trailer did not feature any gameplay, the Xbox blog stated it will be a third-person action-adventure game in which players will have to track down supernatural creatures. Xbox has yet to reveal a release date for South of Midnight.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/south-of-midnight-is-a-gorgeous-looking-third-person-magic-adventure/1100-6515052/">South Of Midnight Is A Gorgeous-Looking Third-Person Magic Adventure</a></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Star Wars Outlaws</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1639/16394322/4151132-adsf.png" /><br /><h3><p>We got our first look at Ubisoft's open-world Star Wars game, Star Wars: Outlaws, from Massive with a debut cinematic. The trailer introduced us to Kay Vess, an outlaw on the run who gets caught up in a plot involving a crime syndicate in the Outer Rim. The Empire appears to be present, but most of the action appears to revolve around plain old Star Wars dirtbags. Ubisoft ended the first look with a promise of a detailed gameplay walkthrough to take place during its Ubisoft Forward presentation on June 12.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisofts-star-wars-outlaws-open-world-game-debuts-at-xbox-showcase/1100-6515054/">Ubisoft's Star Wars Outlaws Open-World Game Debuts At Xbox Showcase</a></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>33 Immortals</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1639/16394322/4151139-summergamesfest2023-xboxgamesshowcase%2Bstarfielddirect%28sunday%2939-10screenshot.png" /><br /><h3><p>33 Immortals--from Spiritfarer developer Thunder Lotus--may resemble that game in art style, but it's an entirely different beast. A 33-person co-op "pick up and raid" roguelike, it looks to offer a unique, fast-paced action experience with highly customizable abilities and gear. It's coming next year to Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/33-immortals-is-a-co-op-raiding-game-with-you-guessed-it-33-players/1100-6515031/">33 Immortals Is A Co-Op Raiding Game With, You Guessed It, 33 Players</a></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Payday 3</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1639/16394322/4151141-summergamesfest2023-xboxgamesshowcase%2Bstarfielddirect%28sunday%2939-54screenshot.png" /><br /><h3><p>Payday 3 had a new trailer during the Xbox Games Showcase and showed off new gameplay for the heist co-op FPS. You'll still be plotting to rob banks and fend off waves of heavily armed police, but there appears to be an emphasis on better mobility and gadgets to use as you try to secure the bag unscathed. Payday 3 is set to launch in September 3 for Xbox platforms, PlayStation systems, and PC.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-3-gameplay-trailer-reveals-september-release-date/1100-6515055/">Payday 3 Gameplay Trailer Reveals September Release Date</a></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Persona 3 Reload</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1639/16394322/4151121-4150031-screenshot2023-06-08at3.53.50pm.png" /><br /><h3><p>Persona 3 Reload is a full remake of the original Persona 3 using a modern visual style similar to Persona 5. The reveal trailer gave a glimpse into how its world, exploration, social scenarios, and combat are being reimagined. It's still a turn-based RPG with a darker Persona story and when it comes to dungeon crawling, Persona 3 Reload seems to be still built around Tartarus which is a series of procedurally generated floors that evolve as the story goes on. Voice actors have been recast but we can expect the same style of music based on the trailer's new song. It's set to launch sometime in early 2024 for Xbox Series X|S, PC, PlayStation platforms, and Nintendo Switch.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/persona-3-reload-coming-early-2024-trailer-shown-at-xbox-showcase/1100-6514911/">Persona 3 Reload Coming Early 2024, Trailer Shown At Xbox Showcase</a></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Avowed</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1639/16394322/4151143-summergamesfest2023-xboxgamesshowcase%2Bstarfielddirect%28sunday%2944-25screenshot.png" /><br /><h3><p>After several years in development, Obsidian has finally given fans an in depth look at its ambitious first-person RPG, Avowed. The gameplay-driven trailer showcases all the various abilities players can expect to see in the game, including spell-casting, sword-wielding, and flintlock firearms, as well as vibrant environments and fantastical creatures. Avowed is slated to release on Xbox in 2024.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-gameplay-trailer-reveals-2024-release-for-obsidians-new-skyrim-like-rpg/1100-6515018/">Avowed Gameplay Trailer Reveals 2024 Release For Obsidian's New Skyrim-Like RPG</a></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Sea of Thieves: The Legend of Monkey Island</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1639/16394322/4151147-summergamesfest2023-xboxgamesshowcase%2Bstarfielddirect%28sunday%2946-12screenshot.png" /><br /><h3><p>Rare is teaming up with Lucas Arts to bring the legendary adventure series, Monkey Island, to Sea of Thieves. The expansion features several of Monkey Island's iconic characters--all fully-voiced--and a new adventure for sailors to set out on. Best of all, Rare confirmed this new expansion will be entirely free. Sea of Thieves: The Legend of Monkey Island is scheduled to release on July 20, 2023.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sea-of-thieves-the-legend-of-monkey-island-crossover-revealed-at-xbox-games-showcase/1100-6515048/">Sea Of Thieves: The Legend Of Monkey Island Crossover Revealed At Xbox Games Showcase</a></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1639/16394322/4151161-adsf.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>After keeping quiet for the past few years, Ninja Theory has announced the next entry in the Hellblade series is nearly finished. The studio then shared a new cinematic trailer, featuring Senua having a short conversation with her inner voices before colliding through a pool of water. Though Xbox has yet to give an official release date, the trailer confirmed the game is still scheduled to release sometime in 2024.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-hellblade-2-trailer-revealed-at-2023-xbox-games-showcase/1100-6515057/">New Hellblade 2 Trailer Revealed At 2023 Xbox Games Showcase</a></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Like A Dragon 8: Infinite Wealth</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1639/16394322/4151162-summergamesfest2023-xboxgamesshowcase%2Bstarfielddirect%28sunday%2956-52screenshot.png" /><br /><h3><p>Like a Dragon protagonist Ichiban is back in Like a Dragon 8: Infinite Wealth. While the footage shown didn't show off any gameplay, it did give us an <em>extremely</em> intimate look at the lovable character as well as an idea of where the next game will take place: Hawaii. Based on previous looks at the upcoming title, it seems like both Ichiban and previous Like a Dragon protagonist, Kiryu, will be playable in the series' 8th installment. The game is slated to release on November 19, 2023.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-trailer-for-like-a-dragon-8-now-called-infinite-wealth-shown-at-xbox-showcase/1100-6515051/">New Trailer For Like A Dragon 8, Now Called Infinite Wealth, Shown At Xbox Showcase</a></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1639/16394322/4151167-summergamesfest2023-xboxgamesshowcase%2Bstarfielddirect%28sunday%2960-6screenshot.png" /><br /><h3><p>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess is a new title from Capcom, the studio behind of both the Resident Evil and Monster Hunter series. Kunitsu-Gami tasks players with taking down massive supernatural creatures and various yokai as they explore feudal Japan. Though the title looks similar to another Capcom title, Onimusha, Kunitsu-Gami is unattached to the action-adventure series and potentially features multiplayer elements. Xbox has yet to announce a release window for the game.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/capcom-reveals-new-onimusha-like-action-game-kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess/1100-6515058/">Capcom Reveals New Onimusha-Like Action Game, Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</a></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Persona 5 Tactica</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1639/16394322/4151182-summergamesfest2023-xboxgamesshowcase%2Bstarfielddirect%28sunday%291-8-45screenshot.png" /><br /><h3><p>Joker, Skull, Panther, and the rest of the Persona 5 gang are back in Persona 5 Tactica, the newest Persona 5 spin-off that trades in the series signature turn-based combat for a tactics style adventure. Persona 5 Tactica features new characters and an all new story, while also giving players a chance to spend more time with the characters they know and love. The game is slated to release on November 17, 2023.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/persona-5-tactica-officially-revealed-at-xbox-showcase/1100-6515060/">Persona 5 Tactica Officially Revealed At Xbox Showcase</a></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Starfield</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1639/16394322/4151232-summergamesfest2023-xboxgamesshowcase%2Bstarfielddirect%28livenow%21%291-52-6screenshot.png" /><br /><h3><p>Xbox gave fans a deeper look at Starfield all throughout its showcase and Starfield Direct. The upcoming Bethesda title is the studio's most ambitious RPG to date, with over 1,000 planets players can explore, base building, and robust skill trees, dialogue options, stories, and character customization. Todd Howard, director and executive producer at Bethesda, stated that the game allows players to go about exploration and combat in a variety of ways and offers unprecedented levels of freedom. Starfield is scheduled to launch on PC and Xbox Series X|S on September 6.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-story-trailer-gives-your-mission-briefing/1100-6514888/">Starfield Story Trailer Gives Your Mission Briefing</a></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-collectors-edition-includes-five-days-early-access-preorders-available-now/1100-6515081/">Starfield Collector's Constellation Edition Includes 5 Days Early Access, Preorders Available Now</a></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-xbox-controller-and-headset-revealed-and-you-can-buy-them-now/1100-6515078/">Starfield Xbox Controller And Headset Revealed, And You Can Buy Them Now</a></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-direct-teases-force-like-powers/1100-6515080/">Starfield Direct Teases Force-Like Powers</a></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/in-starfield-optional-traits-pair-buffs-with-nerfs-may-end-in-tragedy/1100-6515077/">In Starfield, Optional Traits Pair Buffs With Nerfs, May End In Tragedy</a></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-lets-you-customize-your-ship-with-new-weapons-modules-and-crew-abilities/1100-6515079/">Starfield Lets You Customize Your Ship With New Weapons, Modules, And Crew Abilities</a></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-explains-why-starfield-is-so-damn-big/1100-6515073/">Bethesda Explains Why Starfield Is So Damn Big</a></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfields-crafting-and-modding-looks-wildly-varied/1100-6515076/">Starfield's Crafting And Modding Looks Wildly Varied</a></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-space-combat-lets-you-allocate-power-dogfight-and-board-enemy-ships/1100-6515072/">Starfield Space Combat Lets You Allocate Power, Dogfight, and Board Enemy Ships</a></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-features-the-most-detailed-character-creation-in-a-bethesda-game-yet/1100-6515075/">Starfield Features The Most Detailed Character Creation In A Bethesda Game Yet</a></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-galactic-systems-include-space-cowboys-and-sinister-cults/1100-6515074/">Starfield's Galactic Systems Include Space Cowboys And Sinister Cults</a></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-includes-oblivions-adoring-fan-meme/1100-6515071/">Starfield Includes Oblivion's "Adoring Fan" Meme</a></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Cyberpunk-2077: Phantom Liberty</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1639/16394322/4151201-adsfcopy.png" /><br /><h3><p>Keanu Reeves made his return to the Xbox stage to promote Phantom Liberty, the next chapter in CD Projekt Red's futuristic RPG, Cyberpunk-2077. The DLC takes players to Dogtown, a previously explored part of Night City, and heavily features Reeves as Johnny Silverhand in an all new story. The expansion also adds new guns, swimming, and a new iconic actor: Idris Elba.

The game takes place in the city of Avalon and tasks players with going back and forth in time in order to change events.

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starfield/">Starfield</a> is getting a suitably special collector's edition for the launch of Bethesda next, massive role-playing universe, letting you wear a little bit of the game on your wrist while you play. It's available to preorder now from retailers.</p><p>The star of the show with the collector's edition is the inclusion of a fully-functioning smartwatch, which mimics the exact one your character will receive in game to track a variety of statistics and mission-critical information. The real-world watch might not be as useful, but it will tell you the time and connect to your smartphone to display some notifications and other types of information. It's not exactly clear if it can track your steps.</p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=225336X1707200&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Starfield-Constellation-Edition-Xbox-Series-X/2483061332">See Constellation edition at Walmart</a> </div></div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=VZfI20jEa0c&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/xbox-series-x|s/products/starfield-collectors-edition---xbox-series-x/395098.html">See Constellation edition at GameStop</a> </div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://shop-links.co/1810879690533254072?u1=subid_value">See Constellation edition at Best Buy</a> </div><p>The watch is housed in an equally expensive case, which Bethesda says will feature an intricate locking mechanism in case you need to keep something safe.

<img height="480" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1574/15746725/4151096-cppl_v0.jpg" width="480" /> Phantom Liberty is the latest expansion to Cyberpunk 2077, bringing a spy-thriller to the series. Jake and Jean-Luc had a chance to spend 1 1/2 hours with Phantom Liberty and these are their thoughts.

## Phantom Liberty Rewrites Cyberpunk 2077's DNA

<p dir="ltr">Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty feels more like a top-to-bottom overhaul of the original game than a standard expansion. Of course, it will feature a new story with new characters and a new area to explore, but what left me most excited is how this expansion could potentially shake up the original experience and address many issues players had at launch.</p><p dir="ltr">Before our hands-on demo, quest director Paweł Sasko and quest designer Despoina Anetaky told us that nearly every system had been changed, tweaked, or redone entirely. Unlockable abilities in the skill tree feel more like perks rather than passive stat bonuses; the cybernetics are a lot more robust, offering more gameplay options; and the infamous police response system has been rebuilt from the ground up. This isn't the first time developer CD Projekt Red has done something like this--The Witcher 3's final expansion brought with it a number of changes to the UI and combat--but Phantom Liberty is attempting to comprehensively rewrite Cyberpunk's DNA.</p><p dir="ltr">Phantom Liberty isn't just a glorified update, though. It brings with it a story that leans heavily into the spy thriller genre and new characters including the gruff sleeper cell agent Solomon Reed (portrayed by the illustrious Idris Elba) and a new lawless district of Night City called Dogtown. The setup seems fairly simple: A mysterious character who goes by Songbird promises V that she can remove the deadly biochip from their head, if she can save and protect the president of the New United States after her aircraft crashes in Dogtown.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phantom-liberty-rewrites-cyberpunk-2077s-dna/1100-6515050/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Starfield won't take place in a narrative vacuum, as at the Xbox Showcase, Bethesda revealed more details on some of the characters and factions that players will encounter. Exploration and resource collecting forms a major part of the game, but as you explore the galaxy, you'll come across groups like Constellation. Described as a mythical group of explorers, Constellation is attempting to find the answers to some of humanity's biggest questions.</p><p>The group's current membership is made up of ex-soldiers, scholars, theologians, space cowboys, and other eclectic individuals, and as an explorer who comes across an alien artifact, you'll join them in their search for answers.</p><p>For planets that you'll come across in your journey, you'll be able to see all the info and resources of these celestial objects before you land. One such example given during the Starfield Direct was Porrima IV-c, a rocky moon in the Porrima system with low gravity, a thin atmosphere, and several potentially lucrative elements to harvest. Some planets have key locations to visit, life, and missions that you can undertake, which you can view by checking your map, and you'll even be able to chart a course for your next destination by examining solar systems within galactic sectors through your map.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-galactic-systems-include-space-cowboys-and-sinister-cults/1100-6515074/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Starfield is Xbox's biggest game this fall, and Microsoft took the time to highlight it with its own separate <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-and-starfield-direct-the-biggest-announcements/2900-4772/">Starfield Direct</a> presentation. The lengthy deep dive took a closer look at almost every aspect of the game, and took an especially detailed focus on combat, including how you'll craft and mod weapons to deal with enemies.</p><p>The presentation showed a variety of ways you can outfit your gear to fit the situation or your combat style. Those include modifying your weapons with larger magazines or different grips or barrels to create the right feel and flow. The customization is modular, letting you swap individual parts. A pistol was shown with a silencer, laser sight, and holographic sight options. The suppressor is more suited for a stealthy play style, or you can use explosive rounds if you're in a louder mood. Sometimes you'll need to swap your gear to suit a mission based on the environment, as we saw a look at taking out a distant enemy with a sniper rifle in a hazy fog.</p><p>Bethesda boasted that it's totally overhauled its combat for Starfield, with more fluid animations. You also have more mobility, thanks in part to your jet pack. You have to contend with some of the realities of outer space, like being pushed back if you fire a ballistic weapon in a zero-G environment.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfields-crafting-and-modding-looks-wildly-varied/1100-6515076/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Starfield Space Combat Lets You Allocate Power, Dogfight, and Board Enemy Ships

<p>At the Starfield Direct, Bethseda showed off starship combat, alongside the game's mindbogglingly massive number of other features. When you pilot your spaceship, you can allocate your power to the ships various systems, gaining benefits depending on whether you are fighting or exploring.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">Space combat is a dance between your piloting skills and power allocation. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Starfield?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc^tfw">#Starfield</a> <a href="https://t.co/Bw2t5vUz0d">pic.twitter.com/Bw2t5vUz0d</a></p>  — Bethesda Game Studios (@BethesdaStudios) <a href="https://twitter.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1667963271004016641?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">June 11, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p>For example, increasing your engine power will make your ship go faster, powering up your grav drives will shorten the amount of time before a "warp speed" jump, strengthening the power resources of weapons and shields will help you take less damage and deal more. How much power you can allocate, and what systems are available, is dependent on the layout of your ship (which is fully customizable by the way). There are also special abilities related to piloting. The ability "Targeting Control Systems" will let you target specific subsystems on an enemy craft, knocking out their shields or engines.</p><p>You'll have to stay on your toes as you can be raided by pirates or raid other ships yourself. After destroying an enemy ship, you can loot the remains right from the cockpit. However, you can also board enemy ships by docking with them and take them over from the inside.

<p>During the deep dive into Starfield, Bethesda revealed that it's bringing back a fan-favorite meme from The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. Your adoring fan is back, and you can once again put up with his extremely overbearing affection.</p><p>The presentation outlined the optional Traits system, which lets you pick up to three special traits that will change the game in various ways. These are fully optional, but the presentation showed off a few of them as examples. One was called "Hero Worshipped," which caused a bright-blonde man to run up and lavish you with praise. The studio said he'll go on to join your crew and shower you with gifts.</p><p>Eagle-eyed Bethesda fans recognize that face as belonging to the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/adoring-fan">Adoring Fan</a>, a character from Oblivion who became a meme. He no longer has elven ears, but the face and mannerisms are definitely the same. The dialogue box even refers to him as "Adoring Fan" when he approaches you.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-includes-oblivions-adoring-fan-meme/1100-6515071/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The Xbox Showcase ended with a big surprise, and it wasn't a new game. Instead, it was a hardware revision, offering more storage and a new color option for the popular Xbox Series S model.</p><p>Phil Spencer took the stage briefly to debut the new hardware, a "Carbon Black" Xbox Series S with a 1 TB SSD. It will cost $350, slightly more than a standard white Series S, but still significantly cheaper than the high-end Series X. It's coming September 1, and you can preorder starting today.</p><p>Spencer also mentioned that Xbox has significantly increased its unit production, which should make it easier to find all current Xbox models.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-xbox-series-s-with-1-tb-ssd-announced-preorders-start-today/1100-6515068/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>It's been almost a year since CD Projekt Red first revealed its Cyberpunk 2077 expansion, Phantom Liberty, and at the Xbox Showcase, the studio had more details to share on its "spy-thriller" add-on that takes place in an unexplored district in Night City. In addition, the expansion finally received a release date, with Phantom Liberty launching on September 26.</p><p>CDPR had previously confirmed that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/more-cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-dlc-news-coming-in-june/1100-6512848/">marketing campaign for Phantom Liberty</a> would kick off this month, right as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-summer-game-fest-2023-press-conferences-schedule/1100-6513776/">Not-E3 season</a> began. The expansion features a few new characters--like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077s-phantom-liberty-expansion-features-idris-elba/1100-6509911/">FIA Agent Solomon Reed</a> who is portrayed by actor Idris Elba--and for fans of the nihilistic rocker Johnny Silverhand, the good news is that Keanu Reeves is once again lending his voice and likeness to Cyberpunk 2077's iconic renegade.</p><p>The first look at gameplay for the expansion sets the stage for V's involvement in this politically charged mission, with the promise of a cure leading to a head-on collision with Elba's Reed. There's fleeting shots of spies hiding in plain sight, a focus on silenced weaponry, and a military force far more dangerous and cunning than anything V and Johnny have faced yet.

<p>What's a normal number of players for a cooperative game? Four? No, that's not enough. 20? Still too low. How about 100? No, that's too many. Thunder Lotus knew the only correct answer was 33 when it began developing its new game, the cooperative action-roguelike 33 Immortals, which is coming to Xbox Series X|S and PC next year. </p><p>Set in a hellish world where damned souls are "rebelling against God's final judgment," 33 Immortals uses a matchmaking system to quickly bring 33 players together for raids similar to what you'd expect in an MMO. Each player can pick different perks and weapons to fit their playstyle and, in more of a rogue-lite fashion, there are persistent upgrades available after death so it doesn't feel like you're bashing your head against a wall to beat the enemies. In the announcement, Thunder Lotus referred to the system as "pick up and raid." </p><div>          </div><p> </p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/33-immortals-is-a-co-op-raiding-game-with-you-guessed-it-33-players/1100-6515031/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Towerborne is the next game from Banner Saga developer Stoic and will be published by Xbox Game Studios. Up to four players play as Aces, knights sent from the titular tower to protect it from a crisis affecting all of humanity. They will split their time between combating enemies and exploring the world around the tower, call the Belfry.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">We're thrilled to finally share that we're working with <a href="https://twitter.com/stoicstudio?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">@StoicStudio</a> to bring their new game <a href="https://twitter.com/Towerborne?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">@Towerborne</a> to life!

The game takes its inspiration from classic beat-'em-ups, imprinting them with an RPG twist. Players can customize their Ace both visually and practically, choosing their appearance, weapons, armor, and abilities. Aces will have access to four styles: War Clubs, Gauntlets, Dual Daggers, and Swords &amp; Shields. Each style is customizable and can be played with any other style, so players theoretically won't be locked down by the choices of their co-op partners.</p><p>Aces are immortal, or at least resilient, able to come back after death, adding a light Roguish element to the game's gameplay and its story. Aces will discuss, and remember, their deaths. Despite that touch of darkness, this will be a more family-friendly adventure, in contrast to the dour tone of The Banner Saga. Towerborne will also be a game with continual seasonal updates; new things to do will be consistently added and will gradually reveal an overarching storyline.</p>

<p>Dungeons of Hinterberg made a cel-shaded splash as part of Microsoft's Xbox Games Showcase, with a trailer revealing a unique, modern-day fantasy setting alongside its stylish art style.</p><p>The trailer shows plenty of third-person combat, as the player character, Luisa, battles her way through ancient ruins and dark dungeons. There looks to be plenty of unique ways to traverse the world, including riding in mine carts and grinding on rails. Unique moments also show where the camera pulls out into a more isometric view for platforming, puzzle solving, and what looks to be a boss fight.</p><div>          </div><p>But this isn't a typical fantasy world. Instead, it's a fantastical take on the Austrian Alps. Despite the dungeon-diving and monster-slaying, Luisa's attire is distinctly modern and looks more akin to hiking gear than it does mediaeval armor or weaponry. There are TVs, modern homes, and ski lifts, helping the game's Alpine village of Hinterberg stand out from other, more stereotypical fantasy settings. As for Luisa herself, she's a burnt-out law trainee who travels to Hinterberg to take a break from modern life, and sets out on a journey to become a "Master Slayer."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cel-shaded-rpg-dungeons-of-hinterberg-is-coming-to-xbox-next-year/1100-6515064/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
