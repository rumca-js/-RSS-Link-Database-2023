## Mitchell Starc: ‘The easy money is in franchise cricket, it’s the fast track to notoriety’

<p>The quick on why his goal is to play at his best for Australia with his mates rather than taking the big money offers that come his way</p><p>Mitchell Starc can’t stop fidgeting with his baggy green cap. “Sorry,” he says, breaking off his answer to run his finger under the rim and then tug again at the brim. It is a replica of the one awarded to every Australian player when they make their debut. The marketing team wanted him to put it on for a photoshoot, and Starc just doesn’t feel comfortable. “This one feels so wrong.” Like most Australian players, Starc has only ever had one of them. His is “a lot older, and a lot smellier”. He’s had it for 13 years, and after all that time any other just doesn’t sit quite right.</p><p>Starc, wickedly fast and armed with a yorker that’s paid for at least a couple of dozen podiatrists to buy new kitchens, has proved himself one of the great white-ball bowlers. He has been the world No 1 in 50-over cricket for long stretches of the past decade, and was the leading wicket-taker in both of the past two one-day World Cups. Given all that he could, and should, be one of the richer cricketers on the circuit. Except he hasn’t played a single game of franchise cricket, in the Indian Premier League, the Big Bash, or any other league, in more than eight years.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/11/mitchell-starc-the-easy-money-is-in-franchise-cricket-its-the-fast-track-to-notoriety">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Chilean director follows up on his epic 70s documentary The Battle of Chile with this optimistic portrait of his country’s latest social uprising</p><p>Nearly 50 years ago, the Chilean director Patricio Guzmán created a three-part documentary titled <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/sep/14/books.featuresreviews">The Battle </a></em><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/sep/14/books.featuresreviews">of Chile</a></em>, which gave a detailed account of the civil unrest and the coup that tore the country apart during the 1970s. Now Guzmán once again turns his lens on protest in the country he was forced to leave as a result of his films and his political activities. <em>My Imaginary Country</em> documents a new kind of grassroots protest, one in which every participant is also a citizen journalist; in which police and army atrocities are captured by a hundred phone cameras. The message is ultimately one of hope: for Chileans, this time at least, protest has resulted in real and meaningful changes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/11/my-imaginary-country-review-patricio-guzman-captures-chiles-new-wave-of-protest">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Making a Channel 4 documentary with Davina McCall helped me understand how we are gaslighted about hormonal contraception</p><p>A flurry of headlines and social media conversations was sparked by last week’s broadcast of <em>Davina McCall’s Pill Revolution</em>, a documentary I made with her for Channel 4. This was not merely because Davina courageously got her hormonal coil changed live on telly, but because it resulted in an outpouring of women talking about the deleterious effect of hormonal contraception on their mental health – and their libido. Often over years.</p><p>Yet success in highlighting this conversation comes, once again, from my own failure – failure to see what was right in front of me. I pitched and produced two menopause documentaries with Davina after my own car crash of a menopause, when I couldn’t find information to explain the hell that was happening to me: heart palpitations, rampant anxiety, memory loss and general madness.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/commentisfree/2023/jun/11/the-pills-effects-on-women-can-be-devastating-we-need-better-information-now">Continue reading...</a>

We blame technology for decisions really made by governments and corporations<p>Last November, a young African American man, Randal Quran Reid, was pulled over by the state police in Georgia as he was driving into Atlanta. He was arrested under warrants issued by Louisiana police for two cases of theft in New Orleans. Reid had never been to Louisiana, let alone New Orleans. His protestations came to nothing, and he was in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/31/technology/facial-recognition-false-arrests.html" title="">jail for six days</a> as his family frantically spent thousands of dollars hiring lawyers in both Georgia and Louisiana to try to free him.</p><p>It emerged that the arrest warrants had been based solely on a facial recognition match, though that was never mentioned in any police document; the warrants claimed “a credible source” had identified Reid as the culprit. The facial recognition match was incorrect, the case eventually fell apart and Reid was released.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/11/big-tech-warns-of-threat-from-ai-but-the-real-danger-is-the-people-behind-it">Continue reading...</a>

When it came time to choose what to read on the long flight, I threw Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice into my bag, mostly on a whim. I’d read it and loved it many years before but why it came with me, I can’t entirely say.</p><p>The trip was bleak. I sat in galleries by myself. I ate lunch by myself. And I attended the funeral by myself, where the men from my family assembled in awkward clusters, surrounded by each other, but, in an immediately recognisable way, standing alone.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/11/what-jane-austen-taught-me-about-male-loneliness">Continue reading...</a>
