I see the world is truly going crazy for a VR headset.. and it makes me so incredibly happy. People are REALLY excited for Apple's Vision Pro.. as am I. But after hearing everyone talk about how MAGICAL the UI experience was.. I couldn't help but feel weird.. I NEEDED to try it. Well the headset isn't releasing for another year.. so I decided to take it into my own hands and recreate the Apple Vision Pro's UI on existing hardware, the Meta Quest Pro. Using eye tracking, hand tracking, passthrough and a few days in unity.. I did it. 

And after testing out the basic UI.. I have a LOT of thoughts on the future UIUX of AR and VR headsets. I hope you enjoy!

The APK for this is not quite ready yet. I want to spend a couple more days adding a few features and cleaning up some bugs to give people a good experience. I may just release the unity package instead so people can iterate on it and make their own! The link for the APK or package will be either on my twitter: Twitter.com/Thrilluwu or posted on my discord:
