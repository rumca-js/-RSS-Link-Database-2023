Actress Jennifer Lawrence did NOT wear flip-flops on the red carpet at Cannes to make a political statement. Or even a fashion statement. </p><p>As she explains now, she just wanted to be comfortable. So stand down, America.</p><p>(Yes, this is really a thing the internets are talking about).</p><h3>What did Jennifer Lawrence do at Cannes?</h3><br /><p>She wore flip-flops. Seriously. That's it. She wore flip-flops as she was walking the red carpet for <em>Excellent Cadaver</em> instead of heels, and it was misconstrued as a political statement.</p><p>As <a href=\"https://people.com/jennifer-lawrence-no-idea-flip-flops-fashion-faux-pas-cannes-film-festival-7510383\" target=\"_blank\">People magazine reports</a>, there is a long and messy history of women\u2019s footwear at the global film festival. </p><blockquote>In 2015, women attending the premiere of <em>Carol</em> were denied entry because of their flat shoes, which sparked online outrage and a closer look at the festival\u2019s notoriously strict dress code that includes a high-heel requirement. Shoe choices (or lack thereof) at Cannes were also buzzy topics of conversation when Julia Roberts walked the glamorous red carpet sans shoes in 2016, and other big stars like Kristen Stewart and Susan Sarandon opted for flats. </blockquote><h3>\u201cI had no idea there was a whole controversy...\"</h3><br /><p>\n\tThe actress tells <em>ET</em> she was NOT speaking out against a dress code. It was a comfort thing. And a not wanting to fall on her ass thing.\n</p><div class=\"twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered\" style=\"display: flex; width: 100%; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"></div> <p>\n\t\"I had no idea until it came out that there was a whole controversy with people wearing flats or walking down the red carpet barefoot,\" swears Lawrence. \"I had no clue. My shoes were a size too big.\"\n</p><p>\n\tShe was more concerned about herself, \"I knew I would eat sh*t if I went down in the shoes that were a size too big. I put on the flip-flops, and then everybody's like, 'What a statement! Wow!'\"\n</p><p>\n\tWow, indeed!\n</p><p><br /></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"d987c\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=34098800&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>J-Law can't win for losing. She tried playing nice with the Hollywood elite by <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jennifer-lawrence-trump\" target=\"_blank\">pledging to spit on Donald Trump</a> and <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jennifer-lawrence-politics-family-members\" target=\"_blank\">refusing to affirm her family members' identities as Trump supporters</a>. Instead, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ellendurney/jennifer-lawrences-comeback-and-reinvention\" target=\"_blank\">she was shamed by the left because her</a> \"white feminist sentiments about glass ceilings and [her] being loud [showed] little in the way of action.\"</p><p>This was SUPPOSED to be her big return to acting <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jennifer-lawrence-fix-democracy\" target=\"_blank\">after putting her career on hold to fix democracy</a>. Instead, all anyone wants to talk about is her feet. It's all so very unfair.</p><p>That said, she was excellent in the 2011 film <em>Like Crazy</em>.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

Though, the word \"<a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/teacher-graphic-talk-high-school\" target=\"_blank\">California</a>\" gives away a lot.</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cParents of kids at Edison High School in Huntington Beach, California say this video was played to their kids in math class.

It is only a twenty-nine-second video, so perhaps there is missing context here. There are a few things we DO know. It's June, when we're ordered to celebrate <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/toronto-blue-jays-pride-weekend\" target=\"_blank\">Ls, Gs, Bs, especially the Ts, Qs, As, Is, other Is, Ps, and whatever the hell the +s are</a>. That definitely looks like two (identifies as) chicks making out. We know that woke, Marxist teachers will take advantage of having a captive audience.</p><p>And we know the teacher said this:</p><blockquote>I'm warning you guys now. If you're going to be inappropriate, I will have supervision down here. I will give all of you a Saturday school for next year. So knock it off.</blockquote><p>This was a MATH class. Here's what teacher's next test looks like:</p><ol><li>What is the square root of 69?</li><li>If Skyler has ten apples and Karen takes two, how many apples does Karen have?</li><li>After Sasha stuck her tongue down Paula's throat, she should a) gently caress her nipples with her fingers, b) use her tongue to stimulate her clitoris, c) scissor the sh*t out of her, or d) record a TikTok attacking Ron DeSantis for banning books?</li></ol><p>I'm curious who the audience is that this is for, and how anyone in the school district thinks this is helping. Or, if they just don't care because they have a radical Democrat agenda to indoctrinate and they are running out of school days.</p><p>Straight or gay, no one wants to watch this in ANY class let alone Math. The teacher doesn't sound like the kind who is interested in class discussion. And if the students don't affirm the teacher's agenda, she is threatening them with weekend detention THE FOLLOWING SCHOOL YEAR.</p><p>Such tolerance. Very acceptance. Much equity.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.
