I'm working on new Space Marines from the upcoming Leviathan box, and there's also UFOs in our new game (and the news) so we'll talk about those things, last week's TMX, and of course, I'll answer your wargaming-related questions. Come have fun!

Vince Venturella and I made a new game! Check out MAJESTIC 13 at http://www.majestic13game.com

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
