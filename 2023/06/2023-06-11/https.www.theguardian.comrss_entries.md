<p>This swift documentary looks at the use of photography to shape the previous UK monarch’s image. It’s a fascinating account of her reliance on imagery</p><p>In the late 1930s, the world was in turmoil, old orders were at risk of being overturned and Britain’s monarchy was still reeling from the abdication of Edward VIII. Fearful of the future, the unpopular George VI set in train the phenomenon that would keep his clan in business – just about – for another century: a newsreel photographer was hired to shadow the new king and his family, including his daughter and heir, Elizabeth. The royals were to be put on display.</p><p>So reports Elizabeth: A Life Through the Lens, a slight, swift film that canters through 10 decades in an hour and seems, on the surface, to be a genuflecting biography full of nice photos. But within it is an occasionally fascinating analysis of how and why those pictures were created, illustrating a fundamental truth about the Elizabethan era: it was one long marketing campaign, trying to square the circle of making the British people love their queen without ever getting to know her.</p><p>Elizabeth: A Life Through the Lens is on Channel 4 and on More4</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/11/elizabeth-a-life-through-the-lens-review-the-late-queens-reign-looks-like-one-long-marketing-campaign">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Tory infighting might benefit a country desperate for the unified, tolerant political leadership that the Conservatives can’t supply</p><p>In office, Boris Johnson never took the blame for his mistakes, and never thought there was a time to walk away with dignity. So it was hardly a surprise that when his parliamentary lies <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/09/boris-johnson-resigns-as-mp-with-immediate-effect-over-partygate-report" title="">caught up with him on Friday</a>, he resigned as an MP with a psychologically revealing parting shot. In his own mind, Mr Johnson was a victim not of the facts and evidence but of a cross-party committee’s “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/10/furious-tories-boris-johnson-bias-outburst-rishi-sunak-nigel-adams-byelection" title="">egregious bias</a>”. It never occurred to him that a leader overthrown amid chaos – as he was last <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/07/boris-johnson-resigns-as-conservative-leader-after-cabinet-revolt" title="">summer</a> – should take responsibility for the disarray.</p><p>Mr Johnson was not “forced out of parliament”. He ran away from a fight with the <a href="https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/article/summary/extraordinary-significance-privileges-committee-verdict-boris-johnson" title="">Commons privileges committee</a>, whose report into Partygate apparently lands knockout punches that floored Mr Johnson. The yet-to-be-published conclusion is expected to say that Mr Johnson misled parliament about lockdown parties while prime minister; the committee was expected to recommend his suspension as an MP for more than 10 days, which could have led to a byelection that Mr Johnson didn’t think he would win.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/11/the-guardian-view-of-boris-johnsons-resignation-good-riddance">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Geopolitical fallout from the conflict in Ukraine is threatening an environmentally crucial region</p><p>As the cold war thawed in the 1980s, the frozen high north of the planet was a leading beneficiary of more conciliatory times. <a href="https://www.barentsinfo.fi/docs/Gorbachev_speech.pdf" title="">Speaking</a> in Murmansk in 1987, Mikhail Gorbachev called for an end to military competition in the Arctic, and a new focus on preserving its unique ecosystem. “The community and interrelationship of the interests of our entire world,” said the Soviet leader, “is felt in the northern part of the globe, in the Arctic, perhaps more than anywhere else.”</p><p>Mr Gorbachev’s words paved the way for a cross-state consensus around the idea of “Arctic exceptionalism” – an agreement that in an environmentally crucial region, where Europe, North America and Asia meet, geopolitical rivalries should be put to one side. Since 1996, the Arctic Council, comprising the eight Arctic states including Russia, has embodied that spirit of cooperation. It is yet another disastrous consequence of Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine that it is now at risk.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/11/the-guardian-view-on-the-arctic-threatened-by-putins-war">Continue reading...</a>

One of Africa’s most influential playwrights and poets who served as education minister in her native Ghana<p>Ama Ata Aidoo, who has died aged 81, was one of Africa’s most influential writers. Her plays, short stories, novels and essays explored the experiences of women in contemporary Africa, both rural and urban – women who are remarkable for their spirit, humour and resilience.</p><p>Aidoo’s play The Dilemma of a Ghost, first staged in 1964 at the Ghana Drama Studio when she was 22, was issued by Longman in 1965, making her the first published female African dramatist. This play contrasts a young African- American wife’s idealised concept of “Mother Africa” with the reality of her Ghanaian husband’s African mother’s traditions and expectations, often conflicting with the values embraced by a younger western-educated generation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/11/ama-ata-aidoo-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

It’s hardly obvious territory for opera, but this 75-minute opener to the year’s <a href="https://brittenpearsarts.org/landing-pages/aldeburgh-festival-2023">Aldeburgh festival</a> held the attention in a compelling, albeit sometimes uneasy way, the music’s eerie metallic edge as transfixing as the moral ambiguities of the 18th-century story.

His conviction that Byrne’s body would yield vital secrets led to unseemly bartering with the young man, who was genetically destined to die young.

Shortly after they married, motor neurone disease started cutting a swathe through his family. His uncle. Cousin. His grandmother, mother and sister.

<p>Each of the Pole’s wins at the French Open have shown different dimensions and developments in her game</p><p>In the days leading up to the 2020 French Open, Iga Swiatek was struggling through one of the biggest crises of her career. Having started the Covid-delayed autumn clay-court season with lofty hopes in her first year since graduating from high school, expectations were high. But in her final warmup event, the Italian Open, she endured a desperate, “traumatic” defeat against Arantxa Rus, the world No 71, in the first round.</p><p>Swiatek retreated back to Poland with her small team, where they held talks about her direction and progress. Doubt festered in her mind. When she arrived at Roland Garros, the then 18-year-old struggled through practice, unable to escape her negative spiral. Her mood was so low that she made a bet with her sports psychologist, Daria Abramowicz, to see if she could just get through one training session without any drama. Swiatek spent the days before the tournament questioning her future.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/11/third-roland-garros-win-tennis-iga-swiatek-on-path-to-greatness">Continue reading...</a>

But most of the action takes place on a runway thatstretches nearly the full length of the Etihad Stadium’s pitch, which also belches out fire at strategic moments, and comes illuminated by dozens of spotlights that either point skywards or focus on the audience, illuminating huge sections of the stands, which are already illuminated by the crowd themselves, equipped with Coldplay-inspired flashing wristbands on arrival. The walkway is decorated with an immense moon dangling over its far end and an even more immense model of the Hajime Sorayama-designed robot featured in the video for 2011’s Echoes of Silence. The song doesn’t feature in the setlist, but no matter: the model slowly rotates, shoots coloured lights from its eyes, and provides a focal point around which dancers, clad in white robes and veils that look not unlike Tuareg tagelmusts, move in slow concentric circles.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/11/the-weeknd-review-etihad-stadium-manchester-after-hours-til-dawn">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Is slapping on the factor 50 enough to protect us from skin cancer? Are we safe indoors or on a cloudy day? Here’s what the experts say</p><p>‘I can’t help myself, I’m in love with the summertime,” Divine Comedy frontman Neil Hannon once crooned – and though it’s a sentiment shared by every red-blooded bank holidayer, it’s probably fair to say that sunny afternoons come with a tinge of concern these days. We’re all aware that we probably should be re-applying the factor 50 more often than we do, especially after swimming, but does the state of the ozone layer make things worse? Is the sun somehow … hotter now?</p><p>“The most fundamental thing to understand is that sun exposure without use of high-factor sunscreen or protective clothing is a health hazard,” says Dr Derrick Phillips, consultant dermatologist and spokesperson for the British Skin Foundation. “Cumulative sun exposure over a lifetime damages skin proteins and cellular DNA, causing mutations and increasing the risk of developing skin cancers. Also, the skin becomes less effective at repairing damaged DNA over time. There is currently no way of reversing cumulative DNA damage, and so past sun exposure determines your present risk of skin cancer.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/11/should-i-worry-about-how-much-sun-i-get">Continue reading...</a>

Ducking and swerving, crashing and picking himself up, Boris Johnson is a political wrecker.

<p><strong>Glyndebourne festival, Sussex<br /></strong>Barrie Kosky’s powerful new contemporary-set production is brought to life by a remarkable cast, led by Sally Matthews, and, in the pit, the LPO and Robin Ticciati bring heartbreaking delicacy and energy</p><p>Heavy, pained breathing. Voices of unseen figures, whispering. The brisk clicks of a potato peeler. It has taken almost 50 years for Poulenc’s doomed Carmelite nuns to reach Glyndebourne and their first appearance there, in a new production by Australian director Barrie Kosky, is full of noises. Some are beguiling, some mundane. Many overspill the limits of Poulenc’s score, creating unexpected moments of stasis between the opera’s rapidly cross-cut scenes.</p><p>These can be uncomfortable. In the most terrifyingly effective, the snips of scissors hacking at the nuns’ hair pre-empt the guillotine strokes of the ending. In the strangest, a garden slides on to the stage, rustling in from the peeling concrete walls of Katrin Lea Tag’s single, underpass-chic set. There are, perhaps, too many sluggish fade-outs for an opera with such inexorable momentum: Poulenc’s score sounds the steady tramp of a French Revolution that cannot be stopped, retaining the swift transitions of the screenplay that inspired it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/11/dialogues-des-carmelites-glyndebourne-barrie-kosky-ticciati-review-poulenc">Continue reading...</a>

## What lies behind Russia’s acts of extreme violence? Freudian analysis offers an answer | Peter Pomerantsev

The blowing up of a Ukrainian dam echoes a traditional cycle of destruction and self-destruction marking the country’s history<p>Beneath the veneer of Russian military “tactics”, you see the stupid leer of destruction for the sake of it. The Kremlin can’t create, so all that is left is to destroy. Not in some pseudo-glorious self-immolation, the people behind atrocities are petty cowards, but more like a loser smearing their faeces over life. In Russia’s wars the very senselessness seems to be the sense.</p><p>After the casual mass <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/04/russia-now-synonymous-with-bucha-massacre-zelenskiy-says-amid-global-outcry-at-civilian-killings" title="">executions at Bucha</a>; after the bombing of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/09/ukraine-mariupol-civilians-russia-war" title="">maternity wards</a> in Mariupol; after the laying to waste of whole cities in Donbas; after the children’s torture chambers, the missiles aimed at freezing civilians to death in the dead of winter, we now have the apocalyptic sight of the waters of the vast Dnipro, a river that when you are on it can feel as wide as a sea, bursting through the destroyed dam at Kakhovka. The reservoir held as much water as the Great Salt Lake in Utah. Its destruction has already submerged settlements where more than 40,000 people live. It has already wiped out animal sanctuaries and nature reserves. It will decimate agriculture in the bread basket of Ukraine that feeds so much of the world, most notably in the Middle East and Africa. To Russian genocide add ecocide.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/11/ecocide-russia-ukraine-war-kakhovka-dam-destroyed">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Removing the incongruous image of the Cerne Abbas giant’s member from a dairy product was the upstanding thing to do</p><p>How comfortable are you with sniffing dairy products? Bringing the milky substance right up to your face and giving a long, exploratory nasal inhalation. I’m asking because that’s what M&amp;S now want you to do. They’ve decided to get rid of use-by dates on milk, replacing them with the comparatively toothless best-before dates so “customers can use their judgment”. And by judgment, they mean smell. You can’t rely on your other senses. It’s far too late if you can actually see the milk’s gone off and, if you can hear there’s something wrong with it, you should think about leaving the building.</p><p>So give it a sniff before you chuck it out. We can save the planet one snort at a time. It’s a good idea, though personally I feel undermined. I’ve always been a prudent use-by date observer, while everyone around me has relentlessly proclaimed how fine everything remains for months after the printed deadline. “They just put that on to cover themselves in case you store your food in the airing cupboard,” seems to be the argument. Only in the realm of milk do I have the confidence to sniff and live dangerously – it’s the closest I get to the glamour of a cocaine habit – and now that’s been taken away.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/11/would-you-put-an-erect-penis-on-a-packet-of-cheese-absolutely-no-whey">Continue reading...</a>

I coped with kids and a busy career, so why was I suddenly overwhelmed?<p>Have you found out about your windows of tolerance yet: those moments when you feel fully capable of handling any stress life throws at you? Our tolerance shrinks and expands to suit our needs, but these “windows of tolerance” are a funny thing for women, as I have just discovered, because they unexpectedly disappear when we hit midlife. Sometimes they’re just tiny cracks in the glass and yet you feel you can’t tolerate any stress ever again. It’s a contrary conundrum, as you’d expect life experience and maturity would increase your ability to cope, wouldn’t you?</p><p>However, for an army of midlife women the turmoil of this life stage often inexplicably whips away our ability to deal with difficult situations overnight, from the simplest family problems to the biggest career dilemmas. Any amount of stress seems to overwhelm us.

<p>The actor on bringing one of Barack Obama’s favourite books to TV, going clubbing in Berlin and her fascination with espionage</p><p>Hammersmith-born Rosamund Pike, 44, studied English literature at Oxford before her breakthrough role as a Bond girl in <em>Die Another Day</em>. Subsequent film roles include <em>Pride &amp; Prejudice</em>, <em>Made in Dagenham</em>, <em>Jack Reacher</em> and <em>A Private War</em>. She was Oscar-nominated for <em>Gone Girl</em>, won a Golden Globe for <em>I Care a Lot</em> and an Emmy for <em>State of the Union</em>. Her latest project is a 10-part BBC audio drama <em>People Who Knew Me</em>. She lives in Prague with her partner, businessman Robie Uniacke, and their two sons.</p><p><strong>What attracted you to </strong><em><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/27/people-who-knew-me-review-rosamund-pike-sharon-horgan-happy-hour-whose-truth-is-it-anyway-this-cultural-life-nick-cave">People Who Knew Me</a></strong></em><strong>?<br /></strong>It’s a remarkable story and one I felt emotionally drawn to. Anyone who’s ever told a lie quickly finds that in order to support it, you have to tell another, then another. Here is a woman in her early 20s who has been lying and having an affair. At the point of the cataclysmic horror of 9/11, she has a job in the World Trade Center. She realises that everyone will assume she was at work that morning and will have died, so sees an opportunity to escape. There’s a curiosity in all of us: “What happens if I go out to get a pint of milk and don’t ever come home?” Or maybe that’s not in all of us and I’ve just exposed myself! In her absence, her loved ones have a funeral, mourn her and rebuild their lives. Meanwhile, she jets off to California and adopts a new persona. On screen I’d only get to play the new version of her, in her 40s. But because it’s audio, I can be the girl in her 20s, too.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/11/rosamund-pike-mother-neighbor-russian-spy-people-who-knew-me-interview">Continue reading...</a>

A ban on high-rise buildings contrasts with Britain’s ever thrusting capital<p>There’s a story that sections of the British commentariat have liked to tell for some time, about the differences between London and Paris. The French capital, it says, is over-regulated and over-taxed, nice to look at, good for weekend mini-breaks, but stagnant, frozen, a museum piece. Its British counterpart, in this reading, is thrusting, dynamic, creative, global, open for business.</p><p>The contrast plays out on their respective skylines. Paris, after a flirtation with tall buildings that has led to two or three controversial projects scattered about the edge of its centre, last week reimposed old rules that <a href="https://www.building.co.uk/news/paris-bans-tall-buildings-amid-row-over-herzog-and-de-meuron-tower/5123523.article#:~:text=Paris%20bans%20tall%20buildings%20amid%20row%20over%20Herzog%20%26%20de%20Meuron%20tower,-By%20Tom%20Lowe&amp;text=Paris%20has%20banned%20tall%20buildings,48%2Dstorey%20Le%20Triangle%20tower." title="">ban buildings above 37 metres (121ft)</a>.

<p>Seventy-five years after the Empire Windrush brought one of the first groups of Caribbean migrants to Britain, a number of titles examine the experiences of that generation</p><p>In a black and white photo taken in 1953, a group of nine young black men in suits wander along a street on a quiet Sunday morning in Leeds; one of them plays a guitar, the others banter. They are heading to a cricket ground for a game. Pre-match revelry might not typify grey, forbidding England, but this is the West Indian way. Today, 75 years after the arrival of the HMT Empire Windrush, on 22 June 1948, the image seems emblematic of how Caribbean migration changed Britain for ever. Quiet appreciation, with pencils poised over scorecards, gave way to unbridled excitement, with rattles, banjos, horns and empty beer cans filled with pebbles, whether at Headingley, the Oval or myriad other cricket stadiums.</p><p>Alford Dalrymple Gardner, an amateur guitarist and wicket keeper, was among the Windrush passengers. Along with his youthful fellow travellers (the average age on the ship was 24), he traded the certainty of devastating Caribbean hurricanes and unemployment for the chance of a better life in bombed-out Britain. His zestful style, undiminished by his 97 years and the challenges faced in his bigoted adoptive country, is commemorated in <strong><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/finding-home-9781914344220">Finding Home</a></strong>, a memoir co-authored with his son, Howard. The book chronicles Caribbean pioneers’ pitfalls and triumphs in a country that often seemed to despise them. “I’ll never understand,” writes Gardner early on, “how the colour of my skin can make these people so mad.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/11/what-comes-across-clearly-is-the-emotional-cost-of-migration-windrush-commemorated-in-books">Continue reading...</a>

A piece of research that doesn’t stand up to scrutiny is piling the guilt on to mothers<p>Was Huw Edwards breastfed?

More breastfeeding, it claimed, with the kind of confidence you simply don’t get from a year on formula, “would benefit everybody”.

The mixed messages around formula milk are a minefield for mums<p>I remember very clearly, too clearly maybe, my own little breakdown over baby formula. I was in the Barbican, my baby strapped to me, a hot day, that weird exhausted light, and I called my mum. I was standing outside the supermarket, and I called my mum to ask her, to remind me, the reason why I shouldn’t buy the baby formula. Why I should persist with the breastfeeding, why it had to be me – always infinitely always me – who fed the baby, who got up in the night to feed the baby, who walked through London looking for somewhere soft to sit and feed the baby. She asked me what I wanted to hear and I didn’t know – that was the point. I was quite tired and mad, and the whole parenting project seemed to veer from terribly vivid to totally obscured within the same, sometimes, second.</p><p>My children eat food now. Well, beans and biscuits. But since the recent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/19/co-op-stores-in-england-put-baby-formula-behind-tills-to-deter-theft" title="">reports</a> of how desperate parents are stealing formula milk, the price of which rises wildly, that memory keeps swimming back to me. The cheapest brand has risen by 45% in the last two years.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/11/when-desperate-parents-are-stealing-baby-milk-it-is-time-for-a-new-formula">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The former football enforcer and pundit is a changed man since learning of a girl’s harrowing torment caused by a genetic disorder</p><p>“I’m struggling right now,” Graeme Souness says quietly, his eyes swimming while he tries to hold back the tears as he thinks of Isla Grist, a 14-year-old girl from Inverness, and the stoicism she shows amid almost unbearable suffering. Isla has <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/epidermolysis-bullosa/">epidermolysis bullosa</a> (EB), a rare genetic disorder which blisters half the skin covering her body. It does the same damage beneath the skin, tearing and ulcerating the insides of Isla so that there is never any respite from her pain.</p><p>I tell Souness that, before we began talking, I had been shown a few photographs of Isla’s legs. This was not done in a sensationalist or prurient way, but to help me understand what EB does to children such as Isla. Souness’s gaze glistens with distress when I say these images of devastation show skin that looks as if it has been burned.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/11/graeme-souness-we-all-take-things-for-granted-ill-try-and-be-a-better-person">Continue reading...</a>

We’ve come a long way since buying tickets for public hangings but our blood lust is never far below the surface<p>Last week, I went to Gloucestershire to watch the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/may/29/woman-wins-coopers-hill-cheese-rolling-race-despite-being-knocked-out" title="">annual cheese rolling</a>, an event at which people hurl themselves down a very steep hill after a wheel of double gloucester. This silly-sounding tradition began perhaps 600 years ago – a sort of Alton Towers for the 15th century – and now tends to be described in news reports as “quirky”, “quintessentially English”, or a day for “cheese lovers”. I went along expecting the atmosphere of a village fete: stalls, cheese themes, and half-interested spectators wandering about. I couldn’t have been more wrong.</p><p>What greeted us instead was a baying mob spread across six fields, a worked-up football crowd dropped into the Cotswolds. Grass all around was churned into mud, and before each race there was a full-throated chant you could hear three hamlets away. Nearest the action was a desperate struggle between neighbours to get closer still: perhaps 200 people had swarmed the steep woods on either side, clinging to branches, tramping through nettles, determinedly pushing past each other for a better view. What were they there to see? You realised straight away. They were there to see broken legs and arms.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/11/taste-for-violence-human-nature-public-hanging-phillip-schofield">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The director’s frightening and frenetic adventure is an ever-relevant example of hubris and the danger of greedy industrialism</p><p>In the face of various leadership disasters, it’s become common meme-ing practice in recent years to note that the mayor of Steven Spielberg’s Jaws – the man who wanted to keep the beaches open, even as a Great White was feasting on a buffet of tourists – is still the mayor in Jaws II. Point being, there are rarely any consequences to arrogance and ineptitude, especially if a person has a certain folksy charisma and is only considered guilty of pursuing the almighty dollar.</p><p>The world is run by the mayors of Jaws. And when Spielberg adapted Michael Crichton’s bestselling sci-fi/adventure Jurassic Park, he found another one in Dr John Hammond, an avuncular industrialist who rushes to make a theme park out of cloned dinosaurs. As played by Richard Attenborough, Hammond is a white-bearded grandpa with a twinkle in his eye, eager to open a prehistoric zoo where no expense was spared but all corners were cut. It’s hard to understand him as a villain, though, because Spielberg sees a little of himself in a commercial visionary bringing wonders to the masses. He’s just another fool in charge.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/11/jurassic-park-at-30-spielbergs-blockbuster-warning">Continue reading...</a>

After <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/23/certain-idea-of-france-charles-de-gaulle-julian-jackson-review">his critically acclaimed biography on General de Gaulle</a>, the British historian Julian Jackson has written a 480-page-long analysis of Pétainism, with the trial of Marshal Pétain at its heart. This is not a pretty story. And if you feel like the American diplomat who refused to attend the trial because he did “not wish to relive the decay of French democracy in a hot courtroom”, this book is not for you. If, however, cowardice, bad faith, dishonour and moral ambivalence is your thing, read on.</p><p>It all starts on 24 October 1940 in Montoire with Marshal Pétain and Adolf Hitler shaking hands. This is four months after the “débâcle” of June 1940 and the signing of the armistice between the Vichy regime headed by Pétain and the Third Reich. A few days later, in a radio speech, Pétain addressed the French to explain: “I enter today down the road of collaboration,” adding: “This is my policy. My ministers are responsible to me. It is I alone who will be judged by history.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/11/france-on-trial-case-of-marshal-petain-julian-jackson-review">Continue reading...</a>

Monroe’s husband Arthur Miller had initially written the movie for his wife to star in – opposite her teenage crush, Clark Gable ­­– as a Valentine’s gift, but by the time of the production, Miller and Monroe were close to divorce. Arnold had been invited on set to chronicle the making of the film, but she ended up documenting the end of a marriage.</p><p>The photographer had first met Monroe in 1952, and she helped to make her legend, photographing her in an airport bathroom with her skirt hitched up to her waist, and reading the Molly Bloom section of <em>Ulysses</em> in Central Park. This picture is included in a new exhibition of Arnold’s images of women, which takes in fashion shows in 1950s Harlem and her era-defining reportage for the Magnum agency. I interviewed the photographer in 2002, when she was 90, and she reminisced about Monroe, her muse and her friend: “She made me feel as if I were brilliant,” Arnold said, “and I suppose I made her feel as if she were brilliant.

## The Observer view on Boris Johnson’s resignation: the Tory party is complicit in this disaster | Observer editorial

His departure should prompt reflection among senior Conservatives about how and why they supported him for so long<p>Boris Johnson resigns as he governed: in a blitz of misinformation, abjectly failing to accept responsibility for wrongdoing, and lacking in even a shred of integrity. The statement he issued on Friday evening announcing he was standing down from parliament with immediate effect was characteristically graceless, bitter and deceitful. Though he hinted he would like to make a political comeback, his withdrawal from British political life is long overdue.</p><p>It is an incredible turn in political fortune for a former prime minister who less than four years ago won a general election with an 80-seat majority. Three years later he was forced to resign after being fined by the police for breaking the lockdown regulations he expected everyone else to comply with, sometimes at unthinkable personal cost. Now after seeing a draft of the privileges committee verdict on whether he intentionally misled parliament, he has decided to step down as an MP altogether. This implies that this cross-party committee of MPs – chaired by the respected Labour MP Harriet Harman, and with a majority of Conservative parliamentarians – has made serious findings in relation to the charge that Johnson misled MPs when he told them there had been no social gatherings and no breaking of lockdown rules in Downing Street during his premiership. Johnson has baselessly accused them of a “witch-hunt” and of being a “kangaroo court”, and claimed he is being “forced out of parliament by a tiny group of people”. Yet the privileges committee investigation was democratically mandated by MPs; the committee has no powers to force Johnson to step down, only to recommend to the Commons sanctions that can include a suspension, with one of more than 10 days triggering a recall petition that could lead to a byelection. Only the Commons can collectively impose the recommended sanction on Johnson, through a vote. Only his constituents can unseat him, through a byelection.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/11/observer-view-boris-johnson-resignation-decline-trust-public-office">Continue reading...</a>

## Escaping the Savage Mountain: high drama on K2, 1980

<p>Three mountaineers reckoned their chances of getting down alive at 50:50. But at least they were able to brew up a cup of tea</p><p>In 1980, Pete Boardman attempted the ascent of K2 with Joe Tasker (who took this picture) and Dick Renshaw. K2 is called ‘the Savage Mountain’: its climbing history is one of ‘avalanche, frostbite, desperate retreat and tragedy,’ Boardman explained, before adding his own story in the<em> Observer</em> on 15 February 1981.</p><p>The trio were running low on food and fuel and dogged by bad weather: it started snowing on their last-ditch third attempt on the summit. They pitched a tiny tent on ‘a precipice that sheered away 10,000ft below us.’ As they slept, a violent avalanche buried them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/11/from-the-observer-archive-escaping-the-savage-mountain-1980">Continue reading...</a>

## Why Portuguese wines are such good value | David Williams

With the cost of living rising so fast, it’s good to know that wines from Portugal are the go-to for quality and value<p><strong>Marks &amp; Spencer Found Alicante Bouschet, Alentejo, Portugal 2021 (£8, <a href="https://www.marksandspencer.com/">Marks &amp; Spencer</a>) </strong>There is no end in sight to food and drink inflation, which means the destabilising, stressful feeling of never knowing the price of something from one week to the next is also here to stay. And when it comes to wine, it’s only going to get worse once the new duty rates kick in in August. A lot of people I talk to in the wine trade are to the say least pessimistic about how retailers will go about meeting the sort of price points shoppers have got used to, which will come down to a choice between cutting their margin or cutting corners on quality to absorb the 44p per bottle hike. In that context, regions with the knack for wines with a high quality-to-price ratio are going to be all the more popular, which is why so many retailers seem to be building up their Portuguese ranges at the moment, with wines such as M&amp;S’s brambly, barbecue-friendly Alicante Bouschet.</p><p><strong>Waitrose Loved &amp; Found Trincadeira, Alentejo, Portugal 2021 (£8.99, <a href="https://www.waitrose.com/">Waitrose</a>) </strong>The southern region of Alentejo is one of the best sources in the world for good-value, robust, richly flavoured reds. Waitrose’s offering from the region is a well-made example of the finicky trincadeira grape variety, which, going by its other name of tinta amarela, is one of the grapes used to make port further north in the Douro Valley. In this case it has a lovely ripe blackberry compote character with a subtle softening oak sheen. (It’s also, incidentally, one of a handful of Waitrose wines being bottled without a bottle-top sleeve over the cork, a move which, as well as saving an estimated half-a-tonne of waste per year, will also presumably help keep the packaging costs, and retail price, down). Staying in the Alentejo, Esporão Colheita Red 2021 (£11.50, <a href="https://hic-winemerchants.com/">hic-winemerchants.com</a>) is a super-vibrant blend of five grape varieties with a really juicy herb-inflected red-and-black-fruited style that scores very high on any bang-for-buck index.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/11/why-wines-from-portugal-are-good-value">Continue reading...</a>
