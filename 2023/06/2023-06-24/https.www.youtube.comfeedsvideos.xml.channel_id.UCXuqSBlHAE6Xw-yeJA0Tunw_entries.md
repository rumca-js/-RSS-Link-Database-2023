Watercooling is pretty cool. But hard to make fit in Small Form Factor cases. Even with compact options from the likes of Alphacool or EK, trying to make the pump, reservoir, and radiators fit in a way that can also cool your Nvidia RTX 4090 and Intel Core i9-13900K is a tall order. Billet Labs hopes to change that with their Monoblock. Perhaps the most overkill SFF water cooling solution we've ever seen.
