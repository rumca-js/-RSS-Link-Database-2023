  <p id="4fc8wT">Tesla has had a very good month, at least when it comes to its EV charging standard. Washington state wants to require electric car charging companies to use Tesla’s North American Charging Standard (NACS) in order to be part of the state’s program to support electric vehicles, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/washington-state-plans-mandate-teslas-charging-plug-official-2023-06-23/"><em>Reuters</em></a>. The state’s proposed mandate would put Tesla’s technology in state- and- federally-funded charging sites in the future, though Washington hasn’t decided quite how that will look. </p>
<p id="ZtS3Ii">At the moment, the federal government requires at least four Combined Charging System (CCS) chargers at taxpayer-funded charging sites, and Tonia Buell, the alternative fuels program manager at Washington state’s Department of Transportation (DOT), told <em>Reuters</em> the...</p>

  <p id="Leg853">Happy Saturday, y’all. The weekend is here, bringing with it deals, discounts, and savings on everything from e-bikes and smart plugs to portable speakers that are designed to soundtrack your next shindig. First up, however, is something a little more time-sensitive. </p>
<p id="nZ4kwT">As part of its <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/store/games/deals/">ongoing Hyper Max Sale</a>, Nintendo is offering discounts on both digital titles and DLC for the Nintendo Switch.

  <p id="4X9ZCS">Recently, a friend who has been on Gmail for a long time suddenly noticed the chat availability settings in the upper right of the web app. This notice was actually added to the Gmail page <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22435232/gmail-integrated-chat-room-im-feature-hangouts-publicly-available">about two years ago</a> when Google Chat was integrated into Gmail. It notifies anyone whom you’ve ever used Chat with that you’re at your computer (or phone) and available — or not. </p>
<p id="kbDG44">Even though most people may not receive notification of your availability (especially if you don’t tend to use Google Chat), you may find the idea that somebody may know when you’re using your account... irritating. (At least, my friend did, and I can sympathize.) However, you can turn the notification off — or, at least, mark yourself “away” so that your presence will not be...</p>

  <p id="t3KWYH">Google finally has a default weather app to compete with Apple and Samsung. Though Pixel phones have long been able to display the current weather in widgets, tapping on those widgets just launched a basic screen with a cute weather frog and a handful of stats. It felt like a web page because that’s basically what it was.</p>
<p id="pxrq2I">With the launch of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23765921/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet earlier this week</a>, Google has rectified that situation. Its new weather app — which is accessed via the same widgets as before, as there’s no icon to launch it — has a much nicer design without losing the playfulness of the older experience. It has 10-day and 24-hour forecasts; wind, humidity, barometric pressure, and UV index reports, plus current sun position and sunrise / sunset...</p>
