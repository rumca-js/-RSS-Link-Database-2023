<p>On Friday, a federal court <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/uk-citizen-sentenced-five-years-prison-cybercrime-offenses"><ins>sentenced Joseph James O’Conner</ins></a> to five years in prison for his involvement in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/crypto-scammers-hack-elon-musk-bill-gates-twitter-204011058.html"><ins>2020 Twitter hack</ins></a>. Last month, the 24-year-old, known as PlugwalkJoe online, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uk-citizen-pleads-guilty-to-2020-twitter-hack-and-other-cybercrimes-102634567.html"><ins>plead guilty</ins></a> to a host of cyber crimes, including carrying out a SIM-swapping attack that targeted a TikTok account with millions of followers. The 2020 Twitter hack saw O’Conner and his co-perpetrators obtain access to the company’s backend and subsequently the accounts of Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Barack Obama and more than 100 other high-profile users. O’Conner netted $794,000 in the crypto scam that followed.</p><p>&quot;After stealing and fraudulently diverting the stolen cryptocurrency, O'Connor and his co-conspirators laundered it through dozens of transfers and transactions and exchanged some of it for Bitcoin using cryptocurrency exchange services,&quot; the Justice Department said. &quot;Ultimately, a portion of the stolen cryptocurrency was deposited into a cryptocurrency exchange account controlled by O'Connor.&quot; In 2021, Graham Ivan Clark, the alleged teenage mastermind behind the breach, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=60e97fc3-5759-41aa-a73b-6317bb989588&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=BBC&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2MGU5N2ZjMy01NzU5LTQxYWEtYTczYi02MzE3YmI5ODk1ODgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmJjLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvdGVjaG5vbG9neS01NjQyOTIwNC5hbXAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjQ5MzExYTE5LWZhNTAtNDIxNy04MmM2LTg1YzczMDE4ZWE2NiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAW6ch48L-87PY7YuAMO3swlTiSYip5i5uoUlxt6fUPMg&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.co.uk%2Fnews%2Ftechnology-56429204.amp&amp;uuid=sCQhfnXgnHOntvoi0094"><ins>plead guilty</ins></a> in return for a three-year prison sentence.

Fans have until sometime next week to watch the series before its fate becomes uncertain.</p><p>“As we prepare to combine Paramount+ and Showtime later this month in the US, we are refining our content offering to deliver the best streaming experience for subscribers,” a Paramount+ spokesperson told <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>. “This is consistent with our content strategy since launch and across our business, which ensures we make smart, efficient choices, informed by audience data and insights. We are removing select programming as we look to optimize Showtime’s robust slate of premium originals.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The cancelation comes after Paramount+ previously greenlit a second season of <em>Star Trek: Prodigy</em>. The show could find another home. <em>The Hollywood Reporter </em>notes <em>Prodigy</em> producer CBS Studios plans to complete postproduction on season two and shop both seasons to a new streaming platform. The announcement won’t affect other Star Trek series, with Paramount+ set to remain the home of ongoing entries like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-picks-up-where-it-left-off-130025200.html"><em><ins>Strange New Worlds</ins></em></a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-prodigy-will-be-pulled-from-paramount-next-week-191704393.html?src=rss

<p>Google is looking at online games as a new possible source of income for YouTube, according to a new report by the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2f007401-3eaa-4237-b69b-54ccbe125502&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Wall+Street+Journal&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyZjAwNzQwMS0zZWFhLTQyMzctYjY5Yi01NGNjYmUxMjU1MDIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9nb29nbGVzLXlvdXR1YmUtaXMtdGVzdGluZy1hbi1vbmxpbmUtZ2FtZXMtb2ZmZXJpbmctMTZkMWU3NzI_bW9kPXJzc19UZWNobm9sb2d5IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjYjkzOTMwZi03NjRmLTQwZTEtYjRjZi0yYjgwOTRkZmM2MmMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAT34nJJOsf8toaIhD8azij09HG0Sa5X3m8CizuhFSHUm&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Fgoogles-youtube-is-testing-an-online-games-offering-16d1e772%3Fmod%3Drss_Technology"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></a>. The video hosting platform has reportedly invited employees to test a new product called Playables, which gives users access to online games right on YouTube itself. Based on the internal email the <em>Journal</em> saw, it wouldn't even matter what device they're using: Apparently, the games are accessible both on mobile and on desktop.&nbsp;</p><p>Users will be able to play them on the YouTube website using a web browser or on the app, whether on an Android or an iOS phone. While the report insinuates that there are currently several games available for testing, it only mentioned <em>Stack Bounce</em> in particular. It's an ad-supported arcade game that gets players to smash layers of bricks with a bouncing ball. As the publication notes, YouTube already earns money from gaming livestreams, but this product will give it another way to generate revenue from the industry in the midst of a decline in advertising spending.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While Google failed to grow its defunct Stadia games streaming service and ultimately <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-shutting-down-stadia-162704135.html">shut it down</a>, this endeavor is a different thing altogether.
