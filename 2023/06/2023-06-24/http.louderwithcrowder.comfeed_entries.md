Average, apolitical Americans decided that they no longer wanted to have woke pandering shoved in their faces as they shopped. The company lost tens of billions of dollars and as a result, moved merchandise to a different part of the store. <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/06/06/lgbtq-groups-demand-target-restock-pride-merch/" target="_blank">Progressive activist groups demanded they put the merch back and issue an apology</a>. When that did not work, eleven progressive state attorney generals got involved.</p><p><a href="https://www.ag.state.mn.us/Office/Communications/2023/docs/Target_Ltr.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">They wrote a letter demanding Target be</a> mindful of the "obligations" the store has to the LGBTQ+ community. Well, they didn't "demand" per se. But these eleven top law officials of states strongly recommended the store be mindful. Unclear is if these attorney generals think there is an amendment to the constitution that an arbitrary group of citizens has the right to have a section of a department store all to themselves.</p><h3>Read More...</h3><br /><p><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/target-pride-collection" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_self" title="view post: Watch: YouTuber highlights Target's pride collection that has company panicked they are becoming the next Bud Light">Watch: YouTuber highlights Target's pride collection that has company panicked they are becoming the next Bud Light</a></p><p><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/twilight-actress-target" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_self" title="view post: Watch: Hollywood actress blasts Target's ">Watch: Hollywood actress blasts Target's "performative allyship," claims non-binary 7-year-old can't shop there anymore</a></p><p><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/target-internal-memo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_self" title="view post: Leaked internal memo to Target employees invokes George Floyd to cope with pride backlash, losing $9 billion">Leaked internal memo to Target employees invokes George Floyd to cope with pride backlash, losing $9 billion</a></p><p><br /></p><p>The AGs expressed their concern "regarding recent events in Target stores involving intimidation and destruction of certain Pride-related merchandise and Target’s resulting decision to remove some Pride merchandise from its stores." These eleven elected officials were concerned about the company caving to bullies by removing the merchandise. So they wrote a letter that sounds like they are bullying the stores to put the merch back.</p><blockquote>Against this backdrop, Pride merchandise like Target’s helps LGBTQIA+ people see that they enjoy considerable support and that loud and intimidating fringe voices and bullies do not represent the views of society at large. We understand Target recently pulled some Pride merchandise from its shelves out of concern for worker and customer safety. While we understand the basis for this action, we are also concerned it sends a message that those who engage in hateful and disruptive conduct can cause even large corporations to succumb to their bullying.</blockquote><p>Two things jump out at me. The first is that the letter <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/06/17/lgbtq-pride-violence/" target="_blank">cites a 2022 Washington Post article</a> to back up its allegations that people bully stores. They -- these eleven elected officials whose job is supposed to be to enforce laws and prosecute criminals -- missed <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/target-wapo-bomb-threat-pride" target="_blank">WaPo's 2023 story about GAY RIGHTS ACTIVISTS calling in bomb threats </a>to terrorize Target stores.</p><p>The other is while these eleven attorney generals have taken the time in their official capacity to "strongly encourage" a store, they all forget about doing their day jobs of fixing crime in their states. The lead AG is Minnesota's Keith Ellison, whose <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/minnesota-ag-lawsuit" target="_blank">way to combat crime is to sue companies that were victims of crime for not doing enough to stop the crime being committed against them</a>.</p><p>Maybe these eleven attorney generals should stick to their day jobs. Or, start doing their day jobs. That would be nice.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Watch: This is not Sam Smith botching a stage dive and plummeting like a lead balloon, but it's still funny

A fat dude in a green leotard who looks just like him (or them) attempted a stage dive. </p><p>A "stage dive" is when you jump off of a stage into a crowd, and they lift you up. That part is called "crowd surfing." When the fat dude people thought was Sam Smith left the stage, gravity and an elevated BMI took over and he came crashing down to the ground like a bucket of wet cement. It is unclear as of this writing if everyone in the audience survived.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Similar body size <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/sam-smith-good-morning-britain" target="_blank">and fashion sense</a>. You can definitely see the similarities and it is understandable how someone on the TikTok might get the two confused.<br /></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>But that was not him. <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/06/23/sam-smith-slammed-after-hoax-video-of-embarrassing-stage-dive/" target="_blank">The New York Post</a> is reporting it was a random fat dude from a Vanilla Ice concert. However, it WAS in Seattle. So whoever first posted the video has that going for them at least.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>This is good news for Sam. <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@brandonlatham5/video/7246187526980078894" target="_blank">Because commenters were cruel</a>.<br /></p><p>"He was killin' it…..I mean them."</p><p>"No chance I’d try and catch a grand caravan like that."</p><p>"Someone said the Muncinex Monster."</p><p>"Omgggg it’s like a blimp filled with lead."</p><p>"The audience sounds like they were screaming for their lives."</p><p>Sam's most embarrassing performance <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/sam-smith-unholy" target="_blank">remains being dressed up like Satan at the Grammy's</a>. It was so horrific, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/sam-smith-church-of-satan" target="_blank">the Church of Satan issued a statement that they don't claim him</a>.</p><p>On behalf of everyone here at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website, we ask that everyone please be more careful in the future before making unverified viral video claims. And don't pick on Sam Smith. They are trying to live them's best life, and don't deserve to be tagged in every video of a fat dude on stage.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
