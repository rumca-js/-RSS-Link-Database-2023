Damn. As per usual, someone from Dom Toretto's past shows up to challenge him and his family (this time it's Jason Momoa's Dante). Then there are bunch of cool cars and races and chases and gravity-defying action sequences. And the problem is that the movie and the franchise has grown too massive. So in today's Anatomy of a  Failure, let's try to understand what that means.\n\nBook, Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BW1TN97D?ref_=pe_3052080_276849420\nBook, PDF: email me at saltyfilmento(a)gmail.com\n\nSupport:     https://patreon.com/filmento\nFollow:        https://twitter.com/filmento\nFilmento en Espa\u00f1ol: https://youtu.be/ViDZUofaZd8\n\n#fastx  #fastandfurious #anatomyofafailure\n\nMusic:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@WhiteBatAudio\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@NanoverseProductions\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@AimToHeadOfficial\n\n\n\n-\nFast X (2023)\nThe end of the road begins. Fast X, the tenth film in the Fast & Furious Saga, launches the final chapters of one of cinema\u2019s most storied and popular global franchises, now in its third decade and still going strong with the same core cast and characters as when it began. Over many missions and against impossible odds, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his family have outsmarted, out-nerved and outdriven every foe in their path. Now, they confront the most lethal opponent they\u2019ve ever faced: A terrifying threat emerging from the shadows of the past who\u2019s fueled by blood revenge, and who is determined to shatter this family and destroy everything\u2014and everyone\u2014that Dom loves, forever.  In 2011\u2019s Fast Five, Dom and his crew took out nefarious Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes and decapitated his empire on a bridge in Rio De Janeiro. What they didn\u2019t know was that Reyes\u2019 son, Dante (Aquaman\u2019s Jason Momoa), witnessed it all and has spent the last 12 years masterminding a plan to make Dom everything wrong with fast x honest trailer fast x best moments funniest moments only action fast x cars rome sequence italy scene bomb fast x explained official trailer fast x ending fast x best action scenes watch fast x full movie online free fast x watch online clip hd 4k pay the ultimate price.
