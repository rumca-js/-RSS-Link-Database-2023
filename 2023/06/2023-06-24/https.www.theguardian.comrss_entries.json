Lizzo\u2019s set fits squarely in this bracket, and is in many ways well timed: Saturday afternoon at the festival can sometimes feel a little mortal, so what better time to be reminded of the importance of self-love, the US superstar\u2019s metier?</p><p>Her set on the Pyramid stage exudes it, though it\u2019s better when she shows rather than tells. Lizzo is a joyful performer, today with sea witch-green hair and (at first) a black and pink leather catsuit: like Taylor Swift, she embodies every second of her performance, wearing the emotions on her supremely expressive face and never letting a wink go un-winked. She\u2019s surrounded by her fellow big grrrl dancers, all wearing green wigs and pink leotards, and to see them shimmying together, both in tight choreography yet also clearly spontaneously vibing off real-time joy, is life-affirming. Sonic Youth\u2019s Kim Gordon once said that the beauty of live music is that \u201cpeople pay money to see others believe in themselves\u201d, and you truly believe, from this ebullient, kinetic performance, that everyone onstage does.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/24/lizzo-at-glastonbury-review-life-affirmation-101\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/24/lizzo-at-glastonbury-review-life-affirmation-101", "date_published": "2023-06-24 21:04:39+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Palestinian who fired at Israeli checkpoint in West Bank is shot dead", "description": "<p>Killing by security forces was followed by Israeli settlers attacking a village in occupied territory, setting fire to houses</p><p>A Palestinian gunman opened fire at an Israeli military checkpoint in the West Bank on Saturday before being shot and killed, Israeli police have said.</p><p>Later on Saturday, Israeli settlers rampaged through a Palestinian village in the occupied territory, hurling stones, spraying bullets and setting fire to homes.

The Woodsies tent \u2013 once named the John Peel tent, and playing Kasabian on the pre-show playlist, no less \u2013 fills a good 45 minutes in advance, and nobody seems to be wringing their hands with dilemma or having any terse chats about separating art from artist.

Blossoms and Astley may seem like an unlikely friendship but they share an affection for well-spirited cheese; a love of throwback fun and a freedom from needing to prove any hipster credentials. And what could be a greater RickRoll than the idea that Astley can so convincingly portray these dour anthems of self-loathing just as smoothly as he did Never Gonna Give You Up on the Pyramid hours prior, nailing registers both nasal and falsetto? What with the quiff, boxy suit and gladioli-wafting gestures, anyone outside the tent might be forgiven for thinking it was the real deal \u2026 or at very least a particularly compelling episode of Stars in Their Eyes.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/24/blossoms-rick-astley-glastonbury-review-smiths-covers-morrissey\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/24/blossoms-rick-astley-glastonbury-review-smiths-covers-morrissey", "date_published": "2023-06-24 19:25:25+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Russian TV airs Wagner rebellion briefly, then switches to documentary on caviar", "description": "<p>Official TV usually ignores inconvenient news \u2013 during the 1991 coup attempt it showed a tape of Swan Lake.

The 29-year-old, recently named on <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/13/granta-reveals-its-pick-of-future-star-british-novelists\">Granta</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/13/granta-reveals-its-pick-of-future-star-british-novelists\"> magazine\u2019s prestigious once-a-decade roll</a> of best young British novelists, suspects that was how she first encountered the horrifying case of Shanda Sharer, a US schoolgirl tortured and burned alive by four teenagers in 1992, two years before the author was born. It stuck: Clark\u2019s new novel, <em>Penance</em>, styled as a true-crime story, centres on the grisly murder of a teenager set on fire by three of her schoolmates in a North Yorkshire seaside town on the night of the Brexit vote in 2016.<br /><br />\u201cI\u2019m just interested in people\u2019s lives and the histories of places,\u201d Clark says, sitting down with me in a park near her south London home as a heatwave brews. \u201cTrue crime, done well, feels like one of the only times you get to read nonfiction about day-to-day lives.\u201d The \u201cjunk\u201d podcasts she feasted on in her youth were a gateway in adulthood to the forensic heft of genre classics such as Brian Masters\u2019s <em>\u201cShe Must Have Known\u201d: The Trial of Rosemary West</em>. \u201cHe makes those crimes feel inevitable by stacking up the circumstances; so much of true crime is salacious \u2013 it isn\u2019t interested in what makes [perpetrators] that way.\u201d<br /><br />Reading Masters put Clark in mind to concoct a murder narrative that would double as a sociopolitical excavation of small-town history. More intricate than her 2020 debut <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/boy-parts-9780571384730\">Boy Parts</a></em><em> \u2013 </em>a sleeper hit thanks to TikTok \u2013 the skin-prickling result is a pitch-dark mosaic of murky families and deadly frenemies, chronicling the slow decline of an ill-omened holiday resort with supernatural chills and metafictional twists; think <em>The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer</em> crossed with <em>Mean Girls</em> as told by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/jul/22/gordon-burn\">Gordon Burn</a>, if Burn \u2013 another Newcastle writer drawn to crime \u2013 had lived long enough to turn his laser-like gaze on the dank crevices of the web.<br /><br />Adolescence is trauma, the novel seems to say; was it thus for Clark? \u201cI didn\u2019t set anyone on fire,\u201d she says, deadpan behind leopard-print shades. Nor did she fall, like one character, into the online abyss of school-shooter fandom (not an invented subculture, in case you\u2019re as sheltered as I am). \u201cIt\u2019s just a horrible time, isn\u2019t it? You behave and look worse than at any time in your life; but apart from all the hormonal stuff, your unstable sense of self combines with a lack of full understanding of consequence and permanence,\u201d she says.</p><p>The three years <em>Penance</em> took to write were, she says, akin to pulling teeth, unlike the pleasure she got from <em>Boy Parts</em>, a mischievous satire narrated by a predatory photographer whose images of her male victims are hailed at a hip London gallery as edgy roleplay. \u201cPeople who\u2019ve read it maybe think I\u2019ll be more of a wind-up merchant when they meet me, but I\u2019ve got more of a primary school teacher energy than an enfant terrible vibe,\u201d Clark says.<br /><br />Written when she was 24, in eight months of weekends off from a day job at Newcastle\u2019s Apple store, <em>Boy Parts</em> has so far sold 60,000 copies, she says: strong numbers for any literary debut, especially one from a tiny independent house such as north London\u2019s Influx Press, which said yes to Clark\u2019s cold pitch after she was snubbed by 12 agents. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jul/22/eliza-clark-from-newcastle-working-class-publishers-diverse-boy-parts\">book went more or less unreviewed</a> \u2013 coming out in the plague summer of 2020 didn\u2019t help \u2013 yet steadily amassed word-of-mouth buzz. About a year and a half after publication, Clark began to notice an extra digit on her royalty cheques. \u201cIt was TikTok. I don\u2019t use it, so I had no idea. One of my friends said, it\u2019s everywhere, there are videos about it that have hundreds and hundreds of thousands of views.\u201d</p> <a

But are any of these psychological tricks \u2013 or life hacks, as they are often called these days \u2013 actually true? The truth is, we don\u2019t know; and, in a very real sense, we <em>can\u2019t ever</em> know, because of limitations that are inherent in the design of the relevant experiments \u2013 not just those on weight loss, mindfulness or social media, but just about all experiments in what we might call \u201clifestyle science\u201d. That, at least, is the implication of a new study by a pair of Stanford psychologists, Nicholas Coles and Michael Frank. We\u2019ll get to their work in a minute, but first I\u2019d like to take you back to the German city of Mannheim in 1988.</p><p>It was here that psychologist <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.54.5.768\">Fritz Strack conducted a study</a> that has since been cited almost 3,000 times and become a staple of psychology textbooks and <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers, including Daniel Kahneman\u2019s <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em>. In the experiment, participants were given a cover story: that previous research using questionnaires had excluded participants who were unable to use their hands to fill in the form, and that this study would explore the feasibility of instead holding the pen in your mouth. Half the participants were asked to hold the pen in their teeth (which forced their mouth into a smile) and half in their lips (which forced their mouth into a neutral pout) while they viewed a selection of cartoon strips. Sure enough, the participants who were smiling when they saw the cartoons rated themselves as more amused than the participants who were pulling a neutral (if slightly odd) expression. Importantly, when they were asked afterwards whether they\u2019d suspected anything fishy was going on, none of the participants showed any sign of realising that the pen-in-mouth cover story was simply a way to get them to smile. Strack seemed to have shown that \u2013 at least sometimes \u2013 our facial expressions determine our moods, rather than vice versa.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jun/24/do-life-hacks-work-the-truth-is-well-never-know\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jun/24/do-life-hacks-work-the-truth-is-well-never-know", "date_published": "2023-06-24 15:00:10+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Rise of the robots raises a big question: what will workers do?", "description": "<p>Rapid developments in AI are forcing managers and politicians alike to confront profound questions about the future of jobs</p><p>With a low electrical hum, a small team of boxy, wheeled robots called \u201cants\u201d criss-cross the top of a giant 3D grid of grey storage crates \u2013 60,000 of them - ceaselessly arranging and rearranging them to order.</p><p>Down on the warehouse floor, flat-topped \u201cranger\u201d robots ferry cardboard packing boxes around.

It\u2019s another warm morning from the place where the bridge is named Trent, or so the signs would have me believe. And it\u2019s the day when the tussle for leverage in this Test match might go one way or the other. We\u2019ve had a fast-scoring couple of days on a nice batting surface, 700 runs between the two teams. Centuries yesterday to Annabel Sutherland for Australia and Tammy Beaumont for England. We haven\u2019t lost any play, either, despite that rain delay on day one \u2013 we\u2019ve caught up to 180 overs if you account for two overs for the innings change.</p><p>It\u2019ll be interesting to see how England approach things today. Beaumont and Nat Sciver-Brunt to resume, both played an attacking style yesterday. Sophia Dunkley and Danni Wyatt to follow, who usually do the same. They\u2019re 218 for 2, still 255 behind, but the rate they have been going, could knock those runs off in a couple of sessions. Australia will need to bowl better than they did yesterday to force enough breakthroughs.
