This approach in The Flash and other recent comic book movies is an effective way to create deeper sympathy with the heroes we see on screen.\n\n#IGN", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kd5i5tHvXoo", "date_published": "2023-06-24 14:00:36+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Final Fantasy 16: How to Stagger Enemies and Maximize Your Damage", "description": "One of the most valuable combat skills you can learn in Final Fantasy 16 is how to stagger an enemy.
