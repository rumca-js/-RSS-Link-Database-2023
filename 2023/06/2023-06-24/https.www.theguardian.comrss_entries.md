<p><strong>Pyramid stage</strong><br />Joyful, supremely expressive performer who kinetically embodies every second of her ebullient show is hobbled by painfully literal lyrics</p><p>There’s a real ease to this year’s Glastonbury and many of its bookings have a feelgood theme, leaning on nostalgia, familiarity and affirmation – there’s Rick Astley on the Pyramid (and playing Smiths covers with Blossoms earlier today), Sophie Ellis-Bextor on the Pyramid tomorrow, Spice Girl Melanie C whacking out the greatest hits later on on the Avalon stage. Lizzo’s set fits squarely in this bracket, and is in many ways well timed: Saturday afternoon at the festival can sometimes feel a little mortal, so what better time to be reminded of the importance of self-love, the US superstar’s metier?</p><p>Her set on the Pyramid stage exudes it, though it’s better when she shows rather than tells. Lizzo is a joyful performer, today with sea witch-green hair and (at first) a black and pink leather catsuit: like Taylor Swift, she embodies every second of her performance, wearing the emotions on her supremely expressive face and never letting a wink go un-winked. She’s surrounded by her fellow big grrrl dancers, all wearing green wigs and pink leotards, and to see them shimmying together, both in tight choreography yet also clearly spontaneously vibing off real-time joy, is life-affirming. Sonic Youth’s Kim Gordon once said that the beauty of live music is that “people pay money to see others believe in themselves”, and you truly believe, from this ebullient, kinetic performance, that everyone onstage does.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/24/lizzo-at-glastonbury-review-life-affirmation-101">Continue reading...</a>

## Blossoms and Rick Astley at Glastonbury review – Smiths hits are the very opposite of miserable now

<p><strong>Woodsies</strong><br />Covering the Smiths’ back catalogue in a secret Glasto set, Blossoms are admirably tight, while Astley banishes any sense of moral queasiness at listening to these beloved songs</p><p>It’s a curious thing, cancel culture. Most left-leaning media have unanimously agreed that liking <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/30/bigmouth-strikes-again-morrissey-songs-loneliness-shyness-misfits-far-right-party-tonight-show-jimmy-fallon">Morrissey is a Very Bad Thing</a>, and yet one of the biggest secret draws of the weekend is Blossoms and Rick Astley, performing their set of the Smiths covers for only the third time ever. The Woodsies tent – once named the John Peel tent, and playing Kasabian on the pre-show playlist, no less – fills a good 45 minutes in advance, and nobody seems to be wringing their hands with dilemma or having any terse chats about separating art from artist. At Glastonbury, and in the safe medium of full-band karaoke, we can apparently all ease a collective sigh, comfortable in the knowledge that although Mozza will surely be recouping his fair share of royalties, we’re not<em> really</em> paying directly in. (Or are we?) With this logic, singing along with giddy delirium to Heaven Knows I’m Miserable Now is not only morally permissible but actively encouraged, in the spirit of having a good old festival time.</p><p>Packing my soapbox away in order to properly review the show in hand, it’s easy to see how one might feel comfortable in the easy camaraderie between tonight’s performers, allowing any of Morrissey’s problematic rants to feel very far away. Blossoms and Astley may seem like an unlikely friendship but they share an affection for well-spirited cheese; a love of throwback fun and a freedom from needing to prove any hipster credentials. And what could be a greater RickRoll than the idea that Astley can so convincingly portray these dour anthems of self-loathing just as smoothly as he did Never Gonna Give You Up on the Pyramid hours prior, nailing registers both nasal and falsetto? What with the quiff, boxy suit and gladioli-wafting gestures, anyone outside the tent might be forgiven for thinking it was the real deal … or at very least a particularly compelling episode of Stars in Their Eyes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/24/blossoms-rick-astley-glastonbury-review-smiths-covers-morrissey">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Pyramid stage</strong><br />The Scottish balladeer is full of his usual hilarious banter but his vulnerability also remains, especially as his voice leaves him. Luckily there are 100,000-odd people on hand for support</p><p>Glastonbury 2023 has so far felt short of a big pop crowning moment: there’s no sense of a major arrival like Olivia Rodrigo last year, or a brilliant young artist ascending to headline the Pyramid stage. Alongside Fred Again, perhaps, Lewis Capaldi feels as close as it comes.</p><p>With two albums under his belt, the Scottish balladeer is in the same position as Billie Eilish and Stormzy each were when they topped the bill. You wonder if he’s been offered it – or whether he might even have turned it down, deterred by the pressure of the spotlight. Glastonbury is Capaldi’s widely reported-on return to live performance after cancelling his other June dates in order to prioritise his mental health. “I haven’t been home since Christmas and at the moment I’m struggling to get to grips with it all,” he told fans at the start of the month.<br /><br />He gets straight down to business once he walks on stage in his simple white T-shirt, diving into the first line of recent epic Forget Me. The brisk start feels both cocksure – he hangs off the mic a bit like Liam Gallagher – and anxious, and he has a noticeable cough. This dichotomy is precisely part of Capaldi’s appeal: his songs dwell on his perceived inferiorities, yet that massive voice of his is a bulwark, or a port in the storm. It sounds so much better live than on record, where it’s so often straitjacketed by terrible antiseptic production: wilder and less like an alarm blaring (near enough every chorus on his new album, Broken By Desire to Be Heavenly Sent, goes off like a bomb), and helped, too, by the straightforward rough-and-readiness of his band.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/24/lewis-capaldi-at-glastonbury-review">Continue reading...</a>

The Russian leader’s excessive pride has made him look weak and could be his ruination<p>Hubris. Originally a Greek word, in its English and Russian forms it has come to connote arrogance, haughtiness and excessive pride. Perhaps the most apposite definition at a moment when the Russian people stare aghast at their president, Vladimir Putin, and the chaos he is causing would be “overweening presumption”. Whichever definition is preferred, all accurately describe the fatal flaw that has brought Putin, chief architect of the disastrous Ukraine war, to the perilous place he and Russia occupy today.</p><p>Facing an armed rebellion led by a man he once counted among his most loyal cronies, Putin seems barely able to believe what is happening in southern Russia.

<p>Hailed by Granta as one of Britain’s best young novelists, the author of the TikTok sensation Boy Parts talks about her new book, a crime story based on a real-life murder – and why Bret Easton Ellis wouldn’t talk to her</p><p></p><p>As a teenage goth in Newcastle upon Tyne, Eliza Clark would fall down Wikipedia rabbit holes in her bedroom while tuning into lurid true-crime podcasts with an avidity she now calls “prurient”. The 29-year-old, recently named on <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/13/granta-reveals-its-pick-of-future-star-british-novelists">Granta</a></em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/13/granta-reveals-its-pick-of-future-star-british-novelists"> magazine’s prestigious once-a-decade roll</a> of best young British novelists, suspects that was how she first encountered the horrifying case of Shanda Sharer, a US schoolgirl tortured and burned alive by four teenagers in 1992, two years before the author was born. It stuck: Clark’s new novel, <em>Penance</em>, styled as a true-crime story, centres on the grisly murder of a teenager set on fire by three of her schoolmates in a North Yorkshire seaside town on the night of the Brexit vote in 2016.<br /><br />“I’m just interested in people’s lives and the histories of places,” Clark says, sitting down with me in a park near her south London home as a heatwave brews. “True crime, done well, feels like one of the only times you get to read nonfiction about day-to-day lives.” The “junk” podcasts she feasted on in her youth were a gateway in adulthood to the forensic heft of genre classics such as Brian Masters’s <em>“She Must Have Known”: The Trial of Rosemary West</em>. “He makes those crimes feel inevitable by stacking up the circumstances; so much of true crime is salacious – it isn’t interested in what makes [perpetrators] that way.”<br /><br />Reading Masters put Clark in mind to concoct a murder narrative that would double as a sociopolitical excavation of small-town history. More intricate than her 2020 debut <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/boy-parts-9780571384730">Boy Parts</a></em><em> – </em>a sleeper hit thanks to TikTok – the skin-prickling result is a pitch-dark mosaic of murky families and deadly frenemies, chronicling the slow decline of an ill-omened holiday resort with supernatural chills and metafictional twists; think <em>The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer</em> crossed with <em>Mean Girls</em> as told by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/jul/22/gordon-burn">Gordon Burn</a>, if Burn – another Newcastle writer drawn to crime – had lived long enough to turn his laser-like gaze on the dank crevices of the web.<br /><br />Adolescence is trauma, the novel seems to say; was it thus for Clark? “I didn’t set anyone on fire,” she says, deadpan behind leopard-print shades. Nor did she fall, like one character, into the online abyss of school-shooter fandom (not an invented subculture, in case you’re as sheltered as I am). “It’s just a horrible time, isn’t it? You behave and look worse than at any time in your life; but apart from all the hormonal stuff, your unstable sense of self combines with a lack of full understanding of consequence and permanence,” she says.</p><p>The three years <em>Penance</em> took to write were, she says, akin to pulling teeth, unlike the pleasure she got from <em>Boy Parts</em>, a mischievous satire narrated by a predatory photographer whose images of her male victims are hailed at a hip London gallery as edgy roleplay. “People who’ve read it maybe think I’ll be more of a wind-up merchant when they meet me, but I’ve got more of a primary school teacher energy than an enfant terrible vibe,” Clark says.<br /><br />Written when she was 24, in eight months of weekends off from a day job at Newcastle’s Apple store, <em>Boy Parts</em> has so far sold 60,000 copies, she says: strong numbers for any literary debut, especially one from a tiny independent house such as north London’s Influx Press, which said yes to Clark’s cold pitch after she was snubbed by 12 agents. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jul/22/eliza-clark-from-newcastle-working-class-publishers-diverse-boy-parts">book went more or less unreviewed</a> – coming out in the plague summer of 2020 didn’t help – yet steadily amassed word-of-mouth buzz. About a year and a half after publication, Clark began to notice an extra digit on her royalty cheques. “It was TikTok. I don’t use it, so I had no idea. One of my friends said, it’s everywhere, there are videos about it that have hundreds and hundreds of thousands of views.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/24/eliza-clark-im-more-primary-school-teacher-than-enfant-terrible-boy-parts-penance">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Brazilian artist and illustrator <a href="https://marinaesmeraldo.com/">Marina Esmeraldo </a>started studying tarot during the pandemic. “I dedicated time to self-knowledge practices,” she says. Her new interest in psychology found fertile ground when she started watching the TV show Succession. “It’s a profound portrait of family trauma. The Roy children are always acting from the place of their ‘wounded inner child’ and the tarot is a wonderful way to examine these dynamics.” So Esmeraldo designed a set of cards featuring characters from the show. Her favourite is Kendall and the Tower: “It’s a beautiful representation of his story, as it evokes sudden change, upheaval, chaos and revelation.”</p><p>Click <a href="https://marinaesmeraldo.com/Succession-HBO-Portraits">here</a> to see animated versions of the tarot cards</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2023/jun/24/the-stars-of-succession-as-tarot-cards-in-pictures">Continue reading...</a>

The result of the council’s vicious campaign means most of us will be long dead before their replacements reach maturity<p>In Sheffield, my home town, the council has at last <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/20/sheffield-council-issues-apology-over-tree-felling-scandal" title="">apologised</a> for misleading the public, the media and the courts during the dispute over its unfathomably stupid and vicious campaign to fell 17,500 of the city’s street trees, many of which it now accepts were perfectly healthy. This development is, of course, welcome, if long overdue. But it doesn’t really change anything. Who will ever be able to forget the chainsaws? Beloved limes and sycamores are gone.

<p>A series of surprising studies in psychology shows how deeply our own beliefs influence the outcome of experiments, turning the science on its head. The self-help industry should take note</p><p>“W<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3234043/Want-lose-weight-Buy-SMALLER-plates-Simple-step-really-help-shed-pounds-slashing-159-calories-day-landmark-study-reveals.html">ant to lose weight? </a>Buy smaller plates.” “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDNrAj5Xzys">Mindfulness at work: </a>a superpower to boost productivity.” “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/01/facebook-mental-health-study-happiness-delete-account">Leaving Facebook </a>can make you happier.” That’s what the headlines and Ted Talks would have you believe. But are any of these psychological tricks – or life hacks, as they are often called these days – actually true? The truth is, we don’t know; and, in a very real sense, we <em>can’t ever</em> know, because of limitations that are inherent in the design of the relevant experiments – not just those on weight loss, mindfulness or social media, but just about all experiments in what we might call “lifestyle science”. That, at least, is the implication of a new study by a pair of Stanford psychologists, Nicholas Coles and Michael Frank. We’ll get to their work in a minute, but first I’d like to take you back to the German city of Mannheim in 1988.</p><p>It was here that psychologist <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.54.5.768">Fritz Strack conducted a study</a> that has since been cited almost 3,000 times and become a staple of psychology textbooks and <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers, including Daniel Kahneman’s <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em>. In the experiment, participants were given a cover story: that previous research using questionnaires had excluded participants who were unable to use their hands to fill in the form, and that this study would explore the feasibility of instead holding the pen in your mouth. Half the participants were asked to hold the pen in their teeth (which forced their mouth into a smile) and half in their lips (which forced their mouth into a neutral pout) while they viewed a selection of cartoon strips. Sure enough, the participants who were smiling when they saw the cartoons rated themselves as more amused than the participants who were pulling a neutral (if slightly odd) expression. Importantly, when they were asked afterwards whether they’d suspected anything fishy was going on, none of the participants showed any sign of realising that the pen-in-mouth cover story was simply a way to get them to smile. Strack seemed to have shown that – at least sometimes – our facial expressions determine our moods, rather than vice versa.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jun/24/do-life-hacks-work-the-truth-is-well-never-know">Continue reading...</a>

## Samuel Blaser: Routes review – thrilling homage to a trombone icon

<p>(Enja/Yellowbird) <br />The Swiss musician’s tribute to the late Jamaican jazz and ska king Don Drummond is at once sinuous, sharp and sultry </p><p>Rarely an orchestral favourite, the trombone found a better home in jazz, where it was a mainstay of 1920s Dixieland, later finding a place with modernists such as Roswell Rudd and Delfeayo Marsalis. It further became a key instrument in 1960s Jamaican jazz and ska, thanks to the revered talents of Kingston’s Don Drummond, a pivotal but tragic figure whose life ended in mental health problems and an early death. Swiss trombone star <a href="https://www.samuelblaser.com/">Samuel Blaser </a>is an admirer, and after finding a fellow fan in the festival director of Finland’s <a href="https://festivals.fi/en/festivals/tampere-jazz-happening/">Tampere Jazz Happening</a>, was commissioned to cut a tribute album. His band, drawn from both sides of the Atlantic and including British alto sax <a href="https://www.soweto-kinch.com/">Soweto Kinch</a>, proves a dauntingly tight unit.</p><p>Determined to “create our own musical world” rather than being a mere tribute band, Blaser brings an enticing approach to Drummond originals such as Silver Dollar, played in the sharp, urgent style of the Skatalites, and Green Island, with its sinuous arrangement for six (count ’em) ’bones. The instrumentals are augmented by two winning love calls by Carroll Thompson, erstwhile queen of lovers’ rock, where Blaser blows a blousy response to Thompson’s sultry vocals. For extras come a brace of dubs from the late <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/aug/29/lee-scratch-perry-visionary-master-of-reggae-dies-aged-85">Lee “Scratch” Perry</a>, sparse and dadaist; the real thrill is in the playing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/24/samuel-blaser-routes-review-thrilling-homage-to-a-trombone-icon">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Royal Festival Hall, London</strong><br />Performed live, the pop auteur’s latest album is a magnificent – if occasionally frustrating – fever dream of religious imagery, existential loneliness and oceanic feelings</p><p>Chris – the figure at the centre of Christine and the Queens – is loose in the aisles of the Festival Hall auditorium, one arm encased in a knight’s leather gauntlet, shirtless but for some nipple tape. He clasps hands with one or two fans; kneels down before one woman, who places a hand gently on his head as though in blessing.</p><p>A performer who has morphed personae over the course of four studio albums, Chris’s latest iteration tonight is made of powerful stuff: sinew and muscle. The French singer-producer’s physical presence tonight suggests a full recovery from the knee injury that dogged the rollout of last autumn’s album, <em>Redcar les Adorables Etoiles (Prologue)</em><em>. </em>(Redcar was another persona, leaning into Chris’s embrace of masculine pronouns.) His moves tonight encompass Michael Jackson and Fred Astaire; they nod at statuary, flamenco and vogueing, and remain almost as important as Chris’s transcendent vocals. But for all this display of ripped artistry, tonight’s show – the second of two that close the Meltdown festival, curated by Christine and the Queens – also finds the left-field pop outlier grief-stricken and lost. He is tormented by lust, consumed by yearning and plagued by visions. He inspires awe – and no little tenderness.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/24/christine-and-the-queens-review-grief-lust-and-transcendence">Continue reading...</a>

A shiver of excitement ran down my spine as my toes touched the cold, damp sand.</p><p>In the distance I heard the low chatter of a cormorant sunning itself on a rock.

It’s another warm morning from the place where the bridge is named Trent, or so the signs would have me believe. And it’s the day when the tussle for leverage in this Test match might go one way or the other. We’ve had a fast-scoring couple of days on a nice batting surface, 700 runs between the two teams. Centuries yesterday to Annabel Sutherland for Australia and Tammy Beaumont for England. We haven’t lost any play, either, despite that rain delay on day one – we’ve caught up to 180 overs if you account for two overs for the innings change.</p><p>It’ll be interesting to see how England approach things today. Beaumont and Nat Sciver-Brunt to resume, both played an attacking style yesterday. Sophia Dunkley and Danni Wyatt to follow, who usually do the same. They’re 218 for 2, still 255 behind, but the rate they have been going, could knock those runs off in a couple of sessions. Australia will need to bowl better than they did yesterday to force enough breakthroughs. Fatigue for both teams will increasingly become an factor.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/jun/24/womens-ashes-england-australia-live-cricket-updates-test-match-cricket-eng-v-aus-latest-score-scorecard-day-three-trent-bridge">Continue reading...</a>

Guardian readers played a vital role in bringing him to safety </p><p>Tymofiy Seidov’s drawings today are “full of vivid characters and vibrant landscapes”, according to his proud mother, Rita. They are, she says with evident relief, a world away from the art the nine-year-old was producing a year ago. Then, Tymofiy was the only child left in Kutuzivka, a Ukrainian village on the eastern outskirts of Kharkiv, a major city close to the Russian border and an early target of Vladimir Putin’s invading forces.</p><p>Once war broke out, home for Tymofiy and 23 others, including his mother, aunt and grandparents, was a dark, cramped bunker under a bomb-damaged kindergarten, in the centre of a village once populated by 1,500 residents, reduced to 50 within months. All the other children had been evacuated but Tymofiy’s family had nowhere to go and no money to go there. For 87 days, Tymofiy, terrified by the barrage of violence above him, drew his pictures under a tiny LED light, in the corner of the otherwise almost completely dark basement. Tanks featured a lot in his art, as did Dalek-like monsters.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/24/happy-endings-the-ukrainian-boy-stranded-in-a-basement-who-you-helped-to-escape">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Leading authors recommend the best recent books, from a forbidden love affair at the Western Front to a murder mystery set in Egypt</p><p>• <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/24/summer-reading-50-brilliant-books-to-discover">See this year’s pick of 50 books for the summer</a></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/david-nicholls">David Nicholls</a><br /></strong>I’m not sure if it counts as a traditional summer read ­– there were several moments that made me profoundly anxious ­– but I loved Claire Kilroy’s frantic, furious account of early motherhood, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/17/soldier-sailor-by-claire-kilroy-review-immersive-dive-into-the-baby-years">Soldier Sailor</a>, a horror story at times, but full of love, too. Cecile Pin’s debut, Wondering Souls, manages to be both heartbreaking and hopeful and I’m also looking forward to Paul Murray’s new family saga, The Bee Sting; he’s such a sharp and funny writer.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/zadie-smith">Zadie Smith</a><br /></strong>I recently devoured Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin. So enjoyable. I think Susan Sontag’s On Women<em> </em>is perfect if you want to think about the aesthetics of fascism and internecine feminist warfare during the summer – which I find I do. I also just finished Corey Fah Does Social Mobility<em> </em>by Isabel Waidner, out in July. Rare to find a novel with real stylistic and political ambition. Summer is the time for murders set somewhere interesting: Christopher Bollen is the master of these. His latest, The Lost Americans<em>, </em>set in Egypt, is a treat. On my holidays I’ll be packing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/08/kairos-by-jenny-erpenbeck-review-a-monumental-breakup">Kairos</a><em> </em>because it’s by Jenny Erpenbeck, Nicole Flattery’s Nothing Special – because it sounds intriguing – and The Mess We’re In<em> </em>by Annie Macmanus, because it’s set in the early 00s, in Kilburn, and full of music. Finally, in the hand luggage: The Secret Diaries of Charles Ignatius Sancho<em> </em>by Paterson Joseph. I’ve had that one in manuscript form for over a year but didn’t dare read it because I was in the trenches, writing my own historical novel.

<p>The latest all-singing version of Matilda, now on Netflix, joins an impressive library of thoughtful film versions of seminal kids’ books, from Paddington to Kes</p><p>The common wisdom that “the book is usually better than the film” is as true of children’s literature as of its adult counterpart: cinema is stacked with adaptations of children’s classics that may be perfectly proficient, but haven’t the inspired individuality of the works at their source.</p><p>Devotees of Roald Dahl have learned this a lot over the years. His offbeat humour and offhand storytelling style, so irresistible to kids, rarely translates all the way to screen — it’s thwarted such titans as Steven Spielberg, who whiffed with <strong><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80094661">The BFG</a></strong> (Netflix), though Wes Anderson’s droll <strong>Fantastic Mr</strong><strong> Fox</strong> succeeded by inventing eccentricities of its own.

It’s a quiet, sober, thoughtful revolution, but a revolution nonetheless. France is seeking to turn itself into an ecological civilisation.</p><p>Like every government, the French administration should be going further and faster to address the greatest predicament humankind has faced: the gathering collapse of Earth systems. But you can measure the seriousness of the government’s plan by its institutional commitment. France now has a ministry for ecological transition. By the end of next year, the nation’s 25,000 most senior civil servants will have been trained in the principles behind this transition. By the next presidential election, in 2027, every public sector worker will have had this training, <a href="https://www.transformation.gouv.fr/files/presse/Dossier%20de%20presse%20-%20Formation%20%C3%A0%20la%20transition%20%C3%A9cologique%20des%20cadres%20de%20l%27Etat.pdf">tailored to their sector</a>.

<p>Pasta with confit tomato and herby breadcrumbs, a side of tomatoes in a tangy, miso-mango dressing, and summery tomato soup with crab and salted peanuts</p><p>There is a lonely tomato plant in a corner of the Ottolenghi test kitchen. It has grown out of a single seed from a single squashed datterini tomato that we happened to have lying around. To be honest, none of us thought it would come to much. But it did! It recently produced a bounty of five tiny tomatoes, which we cut in half, sprinkled with salt and a drizzle of oil, and enjoyed simply. The delight in a single tomato can be just as rewarding as a salad featuring the season’s plenty. It is for you to choose.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/24/summer-tomato-recipes-pasta-confit-tomato-pangrattato-miso-mango-dressing-soup-crab-peanuts-yotam-ottolenghi">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Annalisa Barbieri has been helping Guardian readers with their personal problems since 2008. Here she shares some of her favourite bits of feedback</p><p>We all hope that any advice we give is taken and enriches someone’s life. As someone who gives advice every week in these pages, I sometimes (but not as often as I would like) get to hear what happened next. When the reader writes back to say that my reply was helpful and how it has changed their life, even in a small way, it makes me feel very happy. Who doesn’t like to make a positive difference?</p><p>Some years ago, a reader, a mother, wrote in to say that she had recently found herself in a difficult relationship. She had been with her boyfriend for two years, after separating from her son’s father. Although the reader and her boyfriend loved each other very much, she said, and there were seemingly many good parts of their relationship, her partner had a hot temper and could be verbally very aggressive and harsh with her little boy, who was only six. The reader and her partner were making plans to move in together. Her son had said he didn’t want this to happen. A brave boy. What should she do, she asked? My advice was to listen to her son and to reconsider the relationship and read up about abusive relationships, which is what I feared hers was, if not already, then certainly becoming.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/24/happy-endings-our-advice-columnist-on-the-columns-that-helped-change-peoples-lives">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An insightful romp through the cult of celebrity, from Da Vinci to the Kardashians</p><p>What do a 41-minute sex tape featuring a little-known personal stylist and a sombre self-portrait in oils by the Renaissance polymath Albrecht Dürer have in common?

The pitch is this: Idris Elba got on a plane from Dubai to Heathrow carrying absolutely no hand luggage at all. This is not the worst part, but it’s the part that has stuck with me the most: not even an iPad, a washbag? It’s a seven-hour flight. Not even a pair of headphones? A change of socks? He bought a Gucci bracelet for his ex-wife that he keeps wistfully fondling, and that’s it. Nobody has a problem with this? Nobody has an issue with this? OK, sure.

<p>Planet is being hit by double whammy of global heating and emerging El Niño</p><p>The planet is being hit with a double whammy of global heating in 2023. On top of the inexorable rise in global temperature caused by greenhouse gas emissions is an emerging El Niño. This sporadic event is the biggest natural influence on year-to-year weather and adds a further spurt of warmth to an already overheating world. The result is supercharged extreme weather, hitting lives and livelihoods.</p><p>The last major El Niño from 2014 to 2016 led to each of those years successively breaking the global temperature record and 2016 remains the hottest year ever recorded. However, El Niño has now begun and may <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/15/record-temperatures-global-heating">already be driving new temperature records</a>, with record <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/02/china-swelters-through-record-temperatures-putting-pressure-on-power-grids">heatwaves on land from Puerto Rico to China</a> and record heatwaves in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/19/marine-heatwave-uk-irish-coasts-threat-oysters-fish-high-temperatures">seas around the UK</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/24/el-nino-how-the-weather-event-is-affecting-global-heating-in-2023">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A thrifty and satisfying way to ferment a fresh ketchup with a harissa kick</p><p>I’ve been developing today’s recipe for almost 20 years, since setting up my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5C887sEI3I">festival cafe, Poco</a>, in 2004. Over the years, the recipe has evolved. Now we ferment it, which keeps it safe to eat without refrigeration – a limited resource in a field kitchen. As well as preserving the food, lacto-fermentation has also had the benefit of improving the flavour, adding complexity and umaminess.</p><p>This recipe is an effective way of preserving a glut of super-ripe, extra-flavourful tomatoes, or turning unripe, flavourless tomatoes into something delicious. Now they are in season, keep your eyes peeled for bargain bags of ripe tomatoes at the market.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/24/how-to-make-a-zingy-ketchup-from-overripe-tomatoes-zero-waste-cooking">Continue reading...</a>

## Arctic Monkeys at Glastonbury review – breaking rock’s rules at their own strange pace

<p><strong>Pyramid stage<br /></strong>With euphoric alt-rock anthems up against atmospheric ballads, this set shows the ground the headliners have covered – but doesn’t always bring the crowd on the journey</p><p>“The Monkeys are back on the farm!” bellows Alex Turner. “Wow!” Indeed, a day ago, it seemed fairly dicey as to whether Friday night at Glastonbury would have a headliner at all thanks to Turner being struck down with laryngitis – presumably, the worst-kept secret set by the Foo Fighters would have been shunted up the bill had the Arctic Monkeys frontman been unable to perform. But he sounds in remarkably good voice. He looks good too: shirt open to reveal a silver chain, foot on the monitors at the front of the stage, emphasising lyrics by raging his right hand in the air, index finger aloft in the manner of John Travolta on the cover of the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack.</p><p>But Arctic Monkeys are a conundrum. On the one hand, they are probably the biggest alt-rock band in Britain: in an era when alternative rock doesn’t really sell, their albums consistently remain in the charts. On the other, only some of their albums are consistently in the charts. Their 2006 debut Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not and 2013’s AM seem to have achieved the kind of sales ubiquity usually reserved for best-ofs by Fleetwood Mac, Elton John or Oasis. But there have clearly been substantially fewer takers for the band’s more recent excursions into more expansive and serpentine realms, Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino and last year’s The Car. You suspect that may be the point – they’ve successfully rid themselves of the beer-chucking lads in their audience, who were frequently the subject of much mortified eye-rolling on Turner’s part – but it makes for a curiously uneven headlining set. The response to the opening Sculptures of Anything Goes – a single from The Car – is decidedly muted. And the crowd only respond in the way the crowd are supposed to respond to a Glastonbury headlining set – ie rapturously – when they play AM’s Snap Out of It.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/24/arctic-monkeys-at-glastonbury-review-pyramid-headline">Continue reading...</a>
