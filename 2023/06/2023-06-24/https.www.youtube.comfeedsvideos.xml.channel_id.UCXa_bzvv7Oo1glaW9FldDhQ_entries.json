Whether or not Kabal is even going to be in the game remains to be seen, but if he does, what can we expect from this rendition of the character? Kabal has changed dramatically time and time again over the course of the Mortal Kombat franchise, so could we be in line for another unique take on the character? \n\nWill Kano and the Black Dragon continue to be a crucial part of his story? Will Stryker? Will Kabal be on the good guys\u2019 side again, after having spent some time in the company of the baddies?\n\nThere\u2019s no denying that Kabal is not one of Mortal Kombat\u2019s more prominent characters, though of course, series fans would surely love to see him making a comeback. Whether or not he does is up in the air right now, but thankfully, with Mortal Kombat 1 set to launch on September 19, there isn\u2019t long left until we know for sure one way or another.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bjqJO5IPmU", "date_published": "2023-06-24 15:30:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "14 UNSKIPPABLE MOMENTS That Ensured You Never Replayed These Games Again", "description": "Video games, especially the bigger budget ones, have it tough.
