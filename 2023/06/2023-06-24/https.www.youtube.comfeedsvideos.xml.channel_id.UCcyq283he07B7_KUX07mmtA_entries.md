Stockfish is cod that is dried by cold air and wind, without using salt. It's one the most coveted sources of protein in Nigeria, where a bag of stockfish sells for $65 per kilogram, seven times as much as other popular fish like croaker. But its supply and prices are volatile. Stockfish cannot be made in Nigeria, and sellers in Nigeria have no control over how much fish is dried or how much of it gets there. It is dried thousands of miles away, in Norway, where there are entire operations dedicated to stockfish. So what does it take to get stockfish to Nigeria? And why is it so expensive?
