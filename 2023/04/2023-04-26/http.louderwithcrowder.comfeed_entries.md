They're really doing it. They're really trying to normalize <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/historian-intergenerational-sex" target="_blank">pedophilia</a>. </p><p>Lord, have mercy. </p><p>The Minnesota legislature is trying to modify the legal definition of "sexual orientation". The proposed bill modifies existing Minnesota law that designates sexual orientation as a protected category, which means it is against the law for the state to discriminate based on sexual orientation. </p><p>One of the authors of the bill is Leigh Finke, a transgender representative who was <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/usa-today-woman-year" target="_self">recently named</a> USA Today's 'Woman of the Year' for the state of Minnesota. Finke previously sponsored a bill to make Minnesota a "trans refuge state," which would legally protect parents who travel to the state to "affirm their child's gender<em>" </em>when their own states have outlawed these, ahem, "medical" procedures.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cBREAKING: A transgender representative in Minnesota has introduced a bill that will remove the exclusion of pedophiles from the protected class of \u201csexual orientation.\u201d\n\nThis means it will be illegal to discriminate against child rapists.\n\nThis is what we have been sounding the\u2026\u201d</div> — Gays Against Groomers (@Gays Against Groomers)

<p>The proposed law first adds a definition for gender identity:</p><p><em>"'Gender identity' means a person’s inherent sense of being a man, woman, both, or neither. A person’s gender identity may or may not correspond to their assigned sex at birth or to their primary or secondary sex characteristics. A person’s gender identity is not necessarily visible to others."</em></p><p>And here's the real kicker. The crossed out sentence at the end is the portion the legislature is currently trying to remove. </p><p><em>"'Sexual orientation' means having or being perceived as having an emotional, physical, or sexual attachment to another person without regard to the sex of that person or having or being perceived as having an orientation for such attachment, <del>or having or being perceived as having a self-image or identity not traditionally associated with one’s biological maleness or femaleness. “Sexual orientation” does not include a physical or sexual attachment to children by an adult."</del></em></p><p>Removing this portion would not *immediately* legalize pedophilia, but it would allow pedophiles to become a protected class with the same legal protections as LGBTQ+ individuals. </p><p>So this is bad. Very bad. Who could possibly have seen it coming?</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## LOL: TV Show Tries To Use Autistic Character To Highlight Transphobia, Accidentally Makes Him Uber Based

<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cIncredible. The autistic doctor, who\u2019s the main character on the show, correctly identifies the male patient as a male while everyone around him is in acute denial of reality.\u201d</div> — Catch Up (@Catch Up)
        <a href="https://twitter.com/CatchUpFeed/status/1651193978191245312">1682510296</a>
</blockquote>

<p>The clip begins with a patient saying, "I'm not a boy. I'm a girl." A female doctor then asks, "You're transgender?" And the patient says yes. </p><p>The autistic chad character quickly replies, "No. Quinn has XY chromosomes like Jared and me, not XX like you. Science says he's male. " The look of utter disdain the doctor gives him as he says this is priceless. </p><p>Another doctor then joins the fray, explaining, "Quinn has gender dysphoria. Her assigned gender is not the one she identifies with. She's mismatched, Dr. Murphy."</p><p>Dr. Murphy, the autistic character, doesn't let up and brings up those pesky little biological facts. But the patient, Quinn, interrupts him and asks how he knows he's supposed to be a boy. He replies, "Your question doesn't make sense."</p><p>I love this guy. </p><p>"I'm not supposed to be anything. I am a boy. Biologically, that's it." </p><p>Dr. Murphy then starts peppering Quinn with questions about why they think they're a girl: "Do you wear dresses? Do you like the color pink? Do you play with dolls? Do you take dance?" His colleague gets increasingly irritated and chastises him for "misgendering" the patient. </p><p>It seems like this was supposed to be a commentary on how Dr. Murphy is transphobic, due to his inability to think "outside the box" and get with the times. But the dichotomy actually just shows how insane the opposition's argument is. It really is as simple as, "I am a boy." It really does just come down to biology and chromosomes. </p><p>And the show eventually proves this point. It turns out Quinn, the transgender patient who claims to be a girl, has testicular cancer. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Airline Passengers Keep Peeing On Other People While In-Flight And It's Downright Bizarre

And apparently this isn't a rare phenomenon. </p><p>The flight took place this past weekend from JFK to New Delhi. The man was reportedly "drunk and unruly" and was arrested when the plane landed. American Airlines said in a statement, <em>"“American Airlines flight 292 with service from John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) to Indira Gandhi International Airport (DEL) was met by local law enforcement upon arrival in DEL due to a disruption on board. </em><em>We’re grateful to our crew members who are consistently dedicated to the safety and care of our customers and handled the circumstances with the utmost professionalism.”</em></p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cAmerican Airlines passenger urinates on another traveler during flight from JFK: reports https://t.co/x2zuFOcTZG\u201d</div> — New York Post (@New York Post)

</blockquote>

<p>So that's horrifying. But this incident is at least the third time since last year a passenger has peed on another human while traveling from New York to New Delhi and vice versa. Last month, a 21-year-old student peed on another passenger in business class on the same flight. This peeing passenger was also in a drunken stupor. He was an Indian national who had been studying in the U.S., and was arrested when the plane landed. </p><p>The pilot and crew said the student was "heavily intoxicated” and was “was repeatedly arguing with the operating crew, was not willing to be seated and continuously endangering the safety of crew and aircraft," and, "after disturbing the safety of fellow passengers, [he] finally urinated on a passenger."</p><p>Back in November, a traveler peed on a poor 70-year-old woman in business class on an Air <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/monkey-kidnaps-dog" target="_blank">India</a> flight from Delhi to New York. This man was banned from Air India for 30 days. Which seems like a pretty light punishment, if you ask me. </p><p>This is quite the bizarre phenomenon. Perhaps it's worth a scientific research study to figure out what exactly prompts people to urinate on others while in-flight. I can only imagine. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Grown adult discovers the car LEASE he's paying means he doesn't own the car, shares his moment of derp for our entertainment

<p>What I'm trying to figure out is how a grown adult doesn't know what a car lease is. I've never owned a new car in my life. I don't find them necessary when a used one gets me from point A to point B. Plus whenever I get a car, I'm just going to install a better sound system anyway. But I still can't think of a point in my life when I did not know the difference between BUY and LEASE.</p><p>I'm sure there was one. There was a point in my life when I didn't know where food came from. I would just open the refrigerator and there it was. It was high school when my family got our first new car, and by then I knew the difference between owning and renting.</p><p>I think the problem with all these younger cats is not growing up with video stores. Going to Blockbuster on the weekend and seeing the difference between $50 to own WrestleMania III and $3 dollars to borrow it for two days prepared me to better understand the economy. This dude never had the educational experience.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cFox Corp chair Rupert Murdoch reportedly removed Tucker Carlson from the air over religious remarks the host made during a speech Friday night.\n\n\u201cThat stuff freaks Rupert out.

<p>The report is titled, "Tucker Carlson’s Prayer Talk May Have Led to Fox News Ouster: 'That Stuff Freaks Rupert Out'”. It references a speech Tucker made just this past weekend at the Heritage Foundation's 50th Anniversary gala:</p><p><em>"According to the source, Fox Corp. chair Rupert Murdoch removed Carlson over remarks Carlson made during a speech at the Heritage Foundation’s 50th Anniversary gala on Friday night. Carlson laced his speech with religious overtones that even Murdoch found too extreme, the source, who was briefed on Murdoch’s decision-making, said. Carlson told the Heritage audience that national politics has become a manichean battle between “good” and “evil.” Carlson said that people advocating for transgender rights and DEI programs want to destroy America and they could not be persuaded with facts."</em></p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>

<p>Carlson concluded that the answer to such issues is prayer: <em>“I have concluded it might be worth taking just 10 minutes out of your busy schedule to say a prayer for the future, and I hope you will."</em></p><p>The source told Vanity Fair this comment in particular freaked Murdoch out because "he doesn’t like all the spiritual talk". </p><p>The report also claims Murdoch and his then-fiancée Ann Lesley Smith had dinner with Carlson back in March. During this dinner, Smith pulled out a Bible and started reading from Exodus. She also reportedly told Carlson he was a "messenger from God".  </p><p>A few days later, Murdoch and Smith called off the wedding. So one has to wonder: was this all just a way for Murdoch to get back at his ex? The world may never know. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

A charlatan. A con man/woman/whatever. Or at the very least say that after running one marathon as a dude, running another one as a lady wearing Rainbow Brite armbands and the Democrat Party flag as a cape screams "hardo."</p><p>But it's 2023 where a female Olympic runner is the problematic one. Two-time Olympian Mara Yamauchi was not impressed with Gen(ique)'s performance.
