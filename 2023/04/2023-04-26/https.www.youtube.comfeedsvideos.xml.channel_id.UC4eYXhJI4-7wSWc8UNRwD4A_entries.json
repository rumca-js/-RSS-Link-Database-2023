A wild deconstructionist whose catalog spans a splatter of hardcore punk, noise and electronic music, Orcutt has written and improvised on four-stringed guitars for four decades, culminating in the ecstatic minimalism of last year's Music for Four Guitars, each part played and dubbed over by himself.\n\nAt the Tiny Desk, however, Orcutt brought along a who's who of forward-thinking guitarists to perform these rowdy, giddy and shreddy pieces: Wendy Eisenberg, Ava Mendoza and Shane Parish, who transcribed the original recordings. From a frenzied hoedown (\"Or from behind\") and feedback-humming drone-pop (\"In the rain\") to something resembling Henry Cow playing Norwegian black metal (\"In profile\") and paradoxically Brutalist complexity (\"Or head on\"), each song is a short burst of finger-flicked frenzy.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Or from behind\"\n\"In the rain\"\n\"At a distance\" \n\"In profile\"\n\"Or head on\" \n\nMUSICIANS\n Bill Orcutt: guitar\n Ava Mendoza: guitar\n Shane Parish: guitar\n Wendy Eisenberg: guitar\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Lars Gotrich\nDirector/Editor: Sofia Seidel\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin \nCreative Director: Bob Boilen\nSeries Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Sofia Seidel, Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame\nAudio Assistant: Brian Jarboe\nProduction Assistant: Jill Britton\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Maia Stern, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Ashley Pointer, Pilar Galv\u00e1n\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #nprmusic #billorcutt", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tu_PRf1tyjI", "date_published": "2023-04-26 09:00:20+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
