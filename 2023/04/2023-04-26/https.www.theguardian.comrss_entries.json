Although named for the Quentin Tarantino film, Kill Bill\u2019s revenge fantasy provides no real emotional payoff; its narrative is a cry of pure fatalism, with no return for its narrator other than a split-second of bloodlust.

There she meets Moose and finally feels on the edge of happiness, until their relationship is brutally cut short and Yamaye begins a journey of self-discovery. Past and present collide with explosive consequences. Ambitious, imaginative and singular, this novel is as relevant to today\u2019s racial climate as the 1970s\u2019, with dub music as a character in its own right.
