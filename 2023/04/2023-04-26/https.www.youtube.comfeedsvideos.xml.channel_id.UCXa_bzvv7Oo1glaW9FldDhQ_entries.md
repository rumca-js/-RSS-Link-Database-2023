if you can set aside your expectations of a “game”, you might find Bramble: The Mountain King to be quite charming. It isn’t a particularly long game, and while it has a number of gameplay mechanics, none of them get particularly deep. 

I don’t think I’ll ever find myself revisiting Bramble: The Mountain King years down the line, however, since there really isn’t all that much to revisit.
