  <p id="pOhTPB">Meta sees “an opportunity to introduce AI agents to billions of people in ways that will be useful and meaningful,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors today.</p>
<p id="VntvVt">While he was vague about how exactly Meta will add generative AI to its apps, Zuckerberg gave the most detailed preview yet during the company’s earnings call for the first quarter of this year, when it <a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2023/Meta-Reports-First-Quarter-2023-Results/default.aspx">reported</a> $28.6 billion in revenue and a record 2 billion daily users of the Facebook app, beating Wall Street’s estimates. Meta’s profit for the quarter was $5.7 billion, a 24 percent decrease from the same time last year.</p>

  <p id="KXY4n9">Google Meet finally supports 1080p video calls — but only for paying subscribers. In an <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/04/full-hd-in-google-meet-video-calls.html">update on Wednesday</a>, Google says it’s bringing the upgrade to select Workspace and Google One users.</p>
<p id="n1yHGq">Additionally, you can only access 1080p video calls on the web-based version of Google Meet, and it all depends on whether your computer’s webcam actually supports the resolution. Google also notes that you’ll need additional bandwidth to send 1080p video and says that it will automatically adjust your resolution if bandwidth is “constrained.”</p>

<p id="U9j43F">You probably know someone who had this happen to them. (Or perhaps you’re worried it could happen to you.) It seems heartless, but the bottom line is that companies abruptly cut off access to protect their interests. You might just want a colleague’s email to keep in touch or might want to save examples of your work to prove your worth to possible employers.

  <p id="hFst9C">The ongoing collapse of Twitter has lots of folks wondering when an all-consuming new social app will rise up to take its place. This week, I want to talk about how things are going at one such upstart — and what it tells us about how new social products win and lose in 2023.</p>
<p id="jFmNxR">That upstart is BeReal. In July of last year, <a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/why-bereal-is-having-a-moment">the photo-sharing app had a breakout moment</a> when frequent discussions of the app on TikTok pushed it to the top of the app store charts. Like most insurgent social networks, BeReal arrived with a novel creative constraint: a once-a-day window to post, delivered at a different time each day via push notification, that attempts to create a less performative social experience by inviting you to post your life at its most...</p>

Tesla disclosed numbers on its supply chain emissions for the first time, which makes its overall carbon footprint much bigger than it has reported in the past.</p>
<p id="eMu4g9">Last year, the company only <a href="https://www.tesla.com/ns_videos/2021-tesla-impact-report.pdf">disclosed</a> how much greenhouse gas pollution it generated from its direct operations and from customers charging their EVs. Altogether that was roughly equivalent to 2.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide.

The new color screen offers a sharp 300ppi resolution when you’re in black-and-white mode but drops to 150ppi when you view content in color.

<p id="k2OOgn">The release of Honda’s new SUV will follow after the automaker’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/6/23388202/honda-prologue-ev-styling-size-specs-crv-passport">upcoming Prologue</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/25/23569823/honda-acura-ev-sales-online-zdx">Acura ZDX SUVs</a>, which are planned for release in 2024. Honda’s Prologue will be a mid-sized SUV that’s about the size of a Passport, and a bit larger than a compact CR-V.

  <p id="GmMmRy">Well, there's not much left for Beats to "announce" after this. On Tuesday evening, Amazon prematurely <a href="https://a.co/d/f7xQvqd">published a retail listing</a> for the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/21/23650567/beats-studio-buds-plus-anc-transparency">rumored</a> Beats Studio Buds Plus. The page contains every last detail about the buds: among other upgrades, they have more powerful active noise cancellation than the original Studio Buds, better air venting, and an improved transparency mode. </p>
<p id="aQQmxK">The Studio Buds Plus will sell for $169.95 when they're released on May 18th, according to Amazon. That's a $20 upcharge compared to the standard Studio Buds released in 2021. The buds and case share a very similar design to the original pair. That'll be a good thing for many; I didn't love their sound quality or find the ANC super effective, but the Studio Buds...</p>

  <p id="bD9qtY">TikTok is working on a feature that will create AI-generated profile pictures, according to social media consultant <a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra">Matt Navarra</a>, who shared images and video of the tool with <em>The Verge</em>. At first glance, the tool creates headshots that look a lot like what you might see from Prisma Labs’ Lensa app, but since it would be built right into TikTok, you might soon be seeing a lot more AI-made avatars as you’re scrolling through your feed.</p>
<p id="sSjgvC">Here’s how it works. The tool asks you to submit three to ten photos and then pick from two to five different styles for the eventual AI-made photos, Navarra says. Once you do, it takes some time for the photos to actually be generated. When they’re ready, you can download them, set one of them as your...</p>
