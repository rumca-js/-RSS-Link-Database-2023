<p>Kenneth Branagh's Hercule Poirot is back in the first trailer for A Haunting in Venice. And this time he might be contending with a foe from <em>beyond</em> the grave, rather than one who merely puts people <em>in</em> a grave.</p><p>That's right, we're talking about ghosts. Watch the trailer below.</p><div>          </div><p>As we see in the trailer, the story revolves around a young girl who died in Venice a year before the events of the film. Michelle Yeoh's character helps the girl's mother perform a seance to talk to the girl--but someone is killed during it, and now Poirot has to solve a potentially new kind of case: a supernatural one.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hercule-poirot-meets-a-spooky-ghost-in-a-haunting-in-venice-trailer/1100-6513621/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Michael Shannon, who will return to the role of General Zod in the upcoming film The Flash, has revealed that he sought Zack Snyder's blessing before committing to the role. According to a new interview on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5IcBWrSAVm0KcqujcPwfon?go=1&amp;sp_cid=22c691ab3b137f78e51a4d7ede9a51e2&amp;utm_source=embed_player_p&amp;utm_medium=desktop&amp;nd=1">Bingeworthy</a> podcast, Shannon reached out to Snyder first before returning to the DC Universe.</p><p dir="ltr">"I was hesitant, because I wasn't really happy about what happened to Zack Snyder in that whole [Justice League controversy] deal," Shannon said. "And I really love Zack. The fact that Zack asked me to play that part to begin with--that's probably the biggest surprise of my career. It almost felt like a practical joke. I was like, 'You're kidding me, right?'"</p><p dir="ltr">Shannon said that he checked with The Flash director Andy Muschietti before contacting Snyder. Both filmmakers approved of Shannon's return to the role of General Zod, and Snyder gave Shannon his blessing. </p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/michael-shannon-wanted-zack-snyders-blessing-to-be-in-the-flash/1100-6513622/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Crash Team Rumble Puts A Modern Spin On The Mascot Platformer, And It Just Might Work

<p dir="ltr">Crash Bandicoot was born as a colorful platforming mascot emblematic of his era, and he's since been reinvented to suit other genres and moments in video game history. He and his wumpa fruit-chasing cohorts have been given the Mario Party treatment in Crash Bash, they went kart racing on several occasions, and he's even been dropped into an auto-runner on mobile platforms. The latest appearance for the perma-grinning orange marsupial is yet again fitting of its moment, even as it might be the most unexpected fit to date.</p><p dir="ltr">Crash Team Rumble is a 4v4 multiplayer game with a unique ruleset and, it seems after a weekend with the beta, a lot of potential. Rather than reskin something familiar in Crash's color palette, Crash Team Rumble finds its own competitive angle and match flow, and its depth of strategy gives it vigor, even as I worry about its life expectancy.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">Players will load into matches cast as familiar characters split into one of several classes, like scorers, defenders, and more. Similar to something like Overwatch, the full game will offer multiple characters in each class, with heroes and villains spanning all of Crash's history on the roster. In the beta, only a small subset of the game's full list of heroes and villains--and their customizable abilities--was available, but it gave me an idea of what to expect.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/crash-team-rumble-puts-a-modern-spin-on-the-mascot-platformer-and-it-just-might-work/1100-6513604/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Starfield does not have an open beta, despite what a sponsored link on Google might have you believe.

The ad for the alleged Starfield beta claims people can "join the adventure" to play the open-world game with friends. The text uses the wrong style for Starfield--writing it as StarField. The link appears above the official page for Starfield on Bethesda's website in Google's search results because it is a paid-for, sponsored result.</p><figure style="width: 936px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4130486-screenshot2023-04-26at4.11.28pm.png"><img alt="Do not click this link" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4130486-screenshot2023-04-26at4.11.28pm.png" /></a><figcaption>Do not click this link</figcaption></figure><p>This is obviously meant to dupe Google users, and people should not click the link.

Still, given that you'll earn points from your XP gains, you might be wondering what will happen if you mess up your build. Here's our guide to help you reset or respec your skills in Star Wars Jedi Survivor.</p><h2>How to reset or respec skills in Star Wars Jedi Survivor</h2><p>To reset or respec skills in Star Wars Jedi Survivor, you'll need to interact with a Meditation Point (the same function that you use to change Lightsaber stances and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-survivor-fast-travel-guide/1100-6513556/"><strong>fast travel</strong></a>). You can then select the Skills option, which is also what you access whenever you need to allocate skill points.</p><p>If you press the corresponding key (i.e., F key on PC, Y on Xbox, or Triangle on PlayStation), you'll be asked if you wish to reset your skills and refund your points. Here's the kicker: your first respec is free. However, all subsequent resets will <strong>cost one skill point</strong>. For instance, if you have a total of 20 skill points, including those that have already been allocated, you'll be refunded 19 points instead.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-survivor-respec-skill-points-reset-guide/1100-6513557/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>There are many areas that you can visit in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-jedi-survivor/"><strong>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</strong></a>. However, there are also those that can't be accessed right from the get-go. For instance, some passageways are blocked by green laser projections, preventing you from entering. Here's our guide to help you unlock green door barriers in Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. Likewise, please be reminded that this guide contains <strong>minor spoilers</strong>.</p><h2>How to unlock green door barriers in Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</h2><p>Technically, you don't really unlock green door barriers in Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.

Along the way, you'll learn two important abilities.</p><p>The first is the <strong>Air Dash</strong>. As the term implies, this lets you do a quick dash move while in mid-air. It's quite useful when trying to reach ledges or grapple points. The second is <strong>Merrin's Charm</strong>. This is granted to you by Merrin, as the two attempt to escape the Pilgrim's Sanctuary. This move is activated by pressing the dash/dodge button. This is essentially how you'll be able to pass through the Star Wars Jedi: Survivor green door barriers.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-survivor-green-door-barriers-guide/1100-6513559/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 director James Gunn has shared his criticisms of Avengers: Infinity War, saying he wouldn't have made the same decisions for the Guardians in the film if it were up to him.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/guardians-of-the-galaxy-chris-pratt-cast-saved-james-gunn-1235401687/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Gunn and the cast of the upcoming Marvel Studios film sat down to discuss the trilogy ahead of its release next month. When talking about the future of the Guardians after the third film releases, Gunn shared his enthusiasm but said he is still protective of the characters he brought to the big screen. The filmmaker brought up Avengers: Infinity War--which was co-directed by Joe and Anthony Russo--and said there were aspects of that film that didn't align with the characters he wrote in the Guardians trilogy, saying, "They did some things that I wouldn't have wanted."</p><div>          </div><p>During one of the major battles in Infinity War, Tony Stark, Peter Parker, Doctor Strange, and the Guardians of the Galaxy team up and attempt to subdue Thanos in order to take the Infinity Gauntlet away from him.

<p dir="ltr">The Walt Disney Co. has filed a First Amendment lawsuit against Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, alleging a "campaign of government retaliation" for Disney's opposition to the "Don't Say Gay" legislation. This escalates the yearlong battle between DeSantis and Disney, as the governor's allies prepare further legislation to assert control over Disney's Orlando theme parks.</p><p dir="ltr">Disney expressed regret that a resolution could not be reached with the governor and had to resort to legal action. The lawsuit states that Disney is fortunate to have the resources to take a stand against the state's retaliation, which smaller businesses and individuals may not be able to do. Disney asserts that in America, the government cannot punish individuals for speaking their mind.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://assets.bwbx.io/documents/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/rzFKoY7UCCM4/v0">Wednesday's 77-page filing</a>, Disney is alleging it has been the victim of a "targeted campaign of government retaliation" that has been "orchestrated at every step by Governor DeSantis as punishment for Disney's protected speech," which threatens Disney's business operations. This comes after DeSantis' statement that he might consider building a prison near Walt Disney World property, adding to the growing tensions between the two parties.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-escalates-battle-with-gov-desantis-files-lawsuit-alleging-first-amendment-violation/1100-6513602/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Remedy Entertainment's Quantum Break is now back on digital storefronts and Game Pass.

## Review Roundup For Star Wars Jedi: Survivor

<p>Early reviews have gone live for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-jedi-survivor/">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a>, the sequel to 2019's Fallen Order. Developed by Respawn Entertainment, Jedi: Survivor once again stars Jedi Knight Cal Kestis as he encounters new enemies and explores a hostile galaxy.</p><p>Building on the foundation of the previous game, Respawn's work has produced a game that's bigger and better than its predecessor according to some critics, while others have noted that technical issues, a lack of polish, and open-world bloat do hold it back from gaining the rank of Jedi Master. Overall, critics say that Jedi: Survivor is everything that a Star Wars fan could want, but be prepared for a game with some very rough technical edges to an otherwise well-written adventure.</p><p>"Exhilarating lightsaber combat and physics-defying platforming puzzle challenges remain the best part of Respawn's latest Star Wars game, but Survivor also makes big swings with its story this time around," Jordan Ramée wrote in GameSpot's Star Wars Jedi: Survivor review. "Cal's quest takes him to new corners of the galaxy, but the most compelling journey he makes is an introspective one. Survivor is a very well-written tale about overcoming fear, and it's the Jedi story I've wanted for a long time."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/review-roundup-for-star-wars-jedi-survivor/1100-6513599/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Director Steven Spielberg expressed regret during a Tuesday interview at Time's 100 Summit in New York City over a decision he made to digitally alter E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial, replacing guns with walkie talkies in the 20th anniversary edition of the 1982 film. <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/steven-spielberg-et-censorship-change-1235402659/">The Hollywood Reporter</a> was first to report.</p><p dir="ltr">During the interview, Spielberg emphasized that E.T. is a product of its era and that no film should be "revised based on modern lenses," either voluntarily or under pressure. He expressed disappointment in himself, stating, "I should have never messed with the archives of my own work, and I don't recommend anyone do that." The decision to alter the film was met with widespread mockery, including from the popular TV show South Park.</p><p dir="ltr">These comments when there is ongoing debate about updating classic literature and films to remove offensive terms and descriptions. However, Spielberg made it clear that he does not believe in censorship of this nature. He jokingly said, "Nobody should ever attempt to take the chocolate out of Willy Wonka!" and added, "For me, it is sacrosanct. It's our history; it's our cultural heritage. I do not believe in censorship in that way."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steven-spielberg-regrets-controversial-change-to-e-t/1100-6513600/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Honkai: Star Rail Is For Genshin Impact Fans Who Don't Have Time For Open Worlds

<p>These days, I find it hard to get excited when developers talk about how much bigger their new open-world map is when compared to their previous games. It sounds cool, sure, but then I'm overcome with thoughts of how I'll never be able to put enough time into a massive open world to get the full experience out of it. HoYoverse has done the opposite when going from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/genshin-impact/">Genshin Impact</a> to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/honkai-star-rail/">Honkai: Star Rail</a>, and it looks to be an ideal direction.</p><p dir="ltr">Honkai: Star Rail is a game that, at least at this point, respects your time. It channels some of the best parts of Genshin Impact while cutting out a lot of what could be considered barriers to entry for newcomers or those with time constraints. In Genshin Impact, the tutorial section was tedious as all hell, forcing new players to trek across wide areas just to enter mini-dungeons to learn basic mechanics--like Breath of the Wild's Great Plateau but far less fun. Meanwhile, Star Rail offers a more linear experience that isn't afraid to get to the point almost immediately, in nearly all aspects of the gameplay.</p><p dir="ltr">HoYoverse developers mentioned streamlining their beginner tutorial process during our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/genshin-impact-developers-talk-endgame-content-and-welcoming-newcomers/1100-6507942/">Genshin Impact version 3.1 interview</a> last year, and it feels like that sentiment made it into Honkai: Star Rail with the level design, especially in the opening hours. From the jump, you don't have to fumble around the environment to get to quest markers or notable destinations. The small, maze-like areas don't encourage much exploration, but they're far more focused and still feel varied enough to keep your attention.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/honkai-star-rail-is-for-genshin-impact-fans-who-dont-have-time-for-open-worlds/1100-6513598/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

The lawsuit was filed by a Black former WWE writer who alleges "racist" script content was specifically created for Black talents like Bianca Belair and Apollo Crews.</p><p>Britney Abrahams began writing for WWE in 2020 and complained of racial and gender stereotypes in scripts. One, in particular, included instructing one of the company's biggest stars, Belair, to say "Uh-Uh! Don't make me take off my earrings and beat your ass!" and Crews to speak with a "stereotypical and exaggerated Nigerian accent." Abrahams said her request to make changes was denied.</p><p>WWE fans will remember Crews went through a character change where he adopted more of his Nigerian heritage and spoke with that accent. Crews (real name Sesugh Uhaa) is of Nigerian descent, with both parents from the country and himself being a first-generation American.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wwe-and-vince-mcmahon-are-being-sued-over-racist-scripts/1100-6513601/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>A machine-learning engineer by the name of Santiago has integrated the ChatGPT Artificial intelligence into a Boston Dynamics robot dog (AKA Spot), creating an experimental machine to help better process the raw data that these robots gather on missions. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/svpino">Santiago</a>, the machines run missions every day and ChatGPT allows the engineers to more efficiently query the data from those operations.</p><p>"We can now ask the robots about past and future missions and get an answer in real-time," Santiago tweeted. "ChatGPT interprets the question, parses the files, and formulates the answer. Massive upgrade!"</p><p>Of course, this isn't a case of simply installing ChatGPT into a robot and getting immediate results. As seen in the video, Santiago and the team had to create specific terms and routines for ChatGPT to function properly within Spot. The end-results are impressive, as combined with Google text-to-speech, Spot can provide valuable feedback and can accept commands, delivering the relevant information that the team requires from its daily walks.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/someone-put-chatgpt-inside-of-a-robot-dog-which-cant-possibly-end-badly/1100-6513590/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor developer Respawn Entertainment has confirmed that a photo mode for the game will be available on launch day. You'll be able to grab some scenic snapshots of the alien planets that Cal Kestis visits, take some photographic evidence of the Empire's various war crimes, and set up an album dedicated to showing off your lightsaber skills.</p><p>You can <em>probably </em>take a picture when you reduce a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-survivor-has-plenty-of-droid-enemy-types-to-hack-up/1100-6511416/">BX battle droid</a>'s mass by the exact weight of its favorite leg, as Respawn did reveal some mechanically macabre dismemberment in a <a href="https://youtu.be/ZdwxdUOQctc">previous gameplay video</a>.</p><p>To show off the potential of the photo mode, Respawn tweeted several pictures that were taken in-game by its developers. All the good stuff from this mode is on display here, ranging from capturing the scale of fighting a Rancor, more intimate moments as Cal explores a forest, and a few ultrawide snaps to show off the planets that the Jedi knight visits in the Fallen Order sequel.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-survivor-photo-mode-will-let-you-capture-all-those-grisly-lightsaber-droid-dismemberments/1100-6513586/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Microsoft has released its latest earnings report, and it showed a mixed bag of results for the Xbox division. Total gaming revenue fell--including a big 30% drop for hardware specifically--but monthly active users for Xbox reached a new third-quarter record.</p><p>Gaming revenue across the board at Xbox dropped by 4%, Microsoft said, while hardware sales slipped 30%. Microsoft said the downturn in hardware sales was attributed in part to a tough comparison to Q3 2022, which Microsoft said benefitted from "increased console supply." Now that Xbox consoles are back in stock everywhere, it seems sales are slowing.</p><p>Xbox content and services revenue jumped by 3% during the quarter thanks to Xbox Game Pass subscriptions continuing to grow. However, Microsoft did not share a new subscriber number. In fact, it's been more than a year since Microsoft announced 25 million members in January 2022.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-just-set-a-new-record-but-it-wasnt-all-good-news/1100-6513585/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Released just last year, Codemasters' latest Grid game (the fifth in the franchise) is arguably the best one yet. Grid Legends has a cinematic story mode, cross-platform multiplayer for up to 22 players, and a creation suite that lets you make your own tracks. It's a good one to check out regardless of if you're a diehard racing fan or casual player, as it's a hybrid arcade-simulation racer with customizable settings.

The downhill cycling game that has a simple hook: bike fast, <em>very </em>fast. This mountain-biking game has procedurally generated tracks to keep things fresh, and your bike itself also has special permutations that utilize roguelike systems. Descenders is fun whether you're playing solo or with friends online. It's also one of those sports games that is pretty easy to get into, but you have to put the time in to really master its unique style.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-free-games-for-may-2023-revealed/1100-6513584/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom Feels Even More Open-Ended Than You Think

<p dir="ltr">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom may have the highest expectations put on any Nintendo game in years. Not only is it the latest release in the storied Zelda franchise, but it's also a direct sequel to Breath of the Wild, regarded by many to be one of the best games of all time. Recent trailers have revealed an emphasis on building amazing machines with a new suite of tools, a seeming nod to the network of Zelda fans who have pulled off amazing feats in Breath of the Wild. And while Nintendo is still maintaining the mystery around much of the game, our extensive hands-on with the new tools showed an incredible amount of creative problem-solving and thrilling traversal in this ambitious sequel.</p><p dir="ltr">My hands-on demonstration was composed of two parts. First, I began with a short segment on the ground, with the simple objective of getting past some enemies and into a tower. This was mostly just for the sake of testing the waters with the array of new tools before preparing to dive into the deep end. While the most obvious path was to go up a ramp structure through a handful of enemies, there were much easier ways. And while there were fairly strict limitations on where I could go throughout the demo session, there were almost no restrictions on what I could do within the spaces provided.</p><p dir="ltr">My first approach was the straightforward one: Stride into the enemy base with my sword and challenge the enemies to combat. This was destined to fail and I knew it, not least because I'm severely out of practice in Breath of the Wild's combat, but I thought it was worthwhile to try regardless. I was handling myself fine against a Bokoblin, but his nearby Moblin friend took notice of the scuffle and came to help, and I was caught off-guard. That was the end of that life.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-feels-even-more-open-ended-than-you-think/1100-6513526/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Microsoft's Acquisition Of Activision Blizzard Has Been Blocked In The UK

<p>After months of deliberation, the UK government's Competition and Markets Authority has decided to block Xbox's acquisition of Activision Blizzard, primarily due to cloud gaming concerns. The CMA says that it reached its decision after it looked at the implications for cloud gaming, as Microsoft's deal "would alter the future of the fast-growing cloud gaming market, leading to reduced innovation and less choice for UK gamers over the years to come," the watchdog organization wrote on its <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/microsoft-activision-deal-prevented-to-protect-innovation-and-choice-in-cloud-gaming">government website</a>.</p><p>The CMA did note that Xbox making Activision Blizzard games like Call of Duty exclusive to its consoles didn't make any business sense. But Microsoft had failed to address the concerns that the group had related to cloud gaming, especially with Microsoft having a "strong position" in that market.</p><p>"Microsoft has a strong position in cloud gaming services and the evidence available to the CMA showed that Microsoft would find it commercially beneficial to make Activision's games exclusive to its own cloud gaming service," it said. "The deal would reinforce Microsoft's advantage in the market by giving it control over important gaming content such as Call of Duty, Overwatch, and World of Warcraft."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-acquisition-of-activision-blizzard-has-been-blocked-in-the-uk/1100-6513583/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p> The first footage from The Nun 2 has debuted at CinemaCon this week, and while the teaser hasn't been made publically available, attendees at the con have described the debut footage. The film sees Taissa Farmiga returning as Sister Irene, to face off against Bonnie Aarons as The Nun, also known as the demon Valak. Euphoria's Storm Reid will also be joining the cast in her Conjuring universe debut.</p><p>According to a description of the trailer from <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/1267590/the-nun-2-footage-reaction-cinemacon-2023/">Slash Film</a>, it opens with a group of girls playing a game called "Defy The Devil" in a spooky abandoned church. The footage shows a statue hidden under a sheet slowly move its head, which initially goes unnoticed by the girls. As part of their game, they dare each other to look for the devil in the form of a monstrous goat in the church's stained glass windows. There does turn out to be a goat depicted in the window, and its eyes glow red as the Nun appears behind one of the girls. She tries to run but is trapped in the church as the statue starts to move again, the sheet slowly falling off to the sound of the girl's screams.</p><p>The trailer takes us back to Sister Irene after this cold open. A priest is asking for her help in dealing with the demon nun Valak, who has returned to the world to wreak havoc. After a montage of what is described as "religious horror imagery," the trailer ends with a short scene of two girls exploring a crawlspace, where they encounter an eerie woman with her back turned. The woman grabs one of the girl's faces in one final jump scare.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-nun-2-reveals-first-details-of-valaks-return/1100-6513581/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The latest patch for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a> is here, though it's only a small hotfix. After the servers went down for maintenance for roughly an hour, <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/hotfix_7_0_5_1">patch 7.0.5.1</a> is now live, bringing a small handful of fixes to a game that has recently been beleaguered by technical issues.</p><p>The new patch has fixed two issues that were causing crashes, one that could be triggered by opening the loadout menu, and another that was caused by an excess of particle effects in certain parts of Neptune. The patch will no doubt be welcome to PS5 players who have been especially impacted by crashes occuring within Neomuna on Neptune. The patch has also tweaked the Daughters of Oryx fight to minimise flashing and adjust the scene's brightness.</p><p>While any patch is better than none, players are still frustrated that the list of fixes is relatively small, with a number of major bugs still unaddressed, including audio issues introduced with patch 7.0.5.0. Destiny 2 has experienced a lot of technical issues lately, with the last few days seeing players struggling with common CHICKEN, WEASEL, and PLUM error codes, along with <a href="https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Post/262776327?sort=0&amp;page=0">a bug</a> that makes it look like all your characters had been deleted.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-version-7-0-5-1-patch-notes-technical-fixes-inbound/1100-6513580/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>In Fortnite's Postcard Tour questline this week, you'll need to unravel a confusing quest that only says something about how "three boats bring cargo." That's all the quest tells you, and without quest markers, it would maybe take a while to figure out. With our guide, it'll be much quicker.</p><h2>Fortnite: "Three boats bring cargo" - quest guide</h2><p>If you're just finishing the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-masked-warrior-made-of-light-location-and-guide/1100-6513578/">masked warrior made of light</a> quest, you're in luck.

Swim, sword-dash, or glide over to there where you'll complete the first part of this quest. </p><figure style="width: 643px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4130028-map2.png"><img alt="Three boats bring cargo" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4130028-map2.png" /></a><figcaption>Three boats bring cargo</figcaption></figure><p>Remember that for the second part, you must emote while standing on the cargo boats.

<p>In Fortnite this week, you'll need to track down a <strong>masked warrior made of light</strong>, but the game doesn't tell you any more than that, making this particular quest quite confusing. But don't worry, we've already done it and can walk you through it right here.</p><h2>Fortnite: In the city, there is a masked warrior made of light - quest guide</h2><p>Your only real clue for this one is the word "city." Follow your instincts and land in Mega City. If you've been playing this season, you may recall the giant hologram of a samurai near the center of the city. It's there you'll want to go. Land next to it and stand on the circle beneath it, then emote. Any emote will do, but don't forget to do at least one before you go or else you'll need to go back. Below you can see the exact landing spot you'll want to use.</p><figure style="width: 777px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4130018-map.png"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4130018-map.png" /></a></figure><p>And that's it! Naturally, this challenge makes a lot less sense if you're just left guessing where to go, and yet with it, it seems so simple. After that, you'll onto the next part of this questline, which mentions how <strong>three boats bring cargo</strong>. It's another tricky one, but not far from Mega City.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-masked-warrior-made-of-light-location-and-guide/1100-6513578/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
