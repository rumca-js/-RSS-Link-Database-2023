<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever struggled to find a feature in Google Sheets, Docs, or Slides, Google has some good news for you&mdash;an enhanced tool finder is coming to the toolbar.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, Google began rolling out a new search bar, one that&rsquo;ll allow you to search for name of the menu item or a description of the feature (for example, &ldquo;who last viewed this document&rdquo;). Suggestions relevant to your recent actions will also appear when you click into the bar. If you create a file, for example, using the enhanced tool finder will offer suggestions like page setup in Docs, inserting rows or columns in Sheets, and editing the theme in Slides. As you get deeper into working on a document, recent actions will show. A shortcut to the find-and-replace tool will always show at the bottom of search results as well&mdash;if you open it, your search term will automatically be pre-populated.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Google enhanced tool finder - animated gif" class="wp-image-1799719" height="887" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/enhanced-tool-discovery.gif?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Google&rsquo;s example of how the new tool finder will work.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Google</p></div>



<p>In <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/04/enhancing-tool-discovery-google-docs-sheets-slides%20.html&amp;xcust=2-2-1799717-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Google&rsquo;s blog post</a> about the new toolbar addition, the company describes the move as something to help users &ldquo;discover&rdquo; often-used tools and features. The current search function (found through <em>Help &gt; Search</em>) is more limited in what it can parse as query terms, and will be eventually phased out. At launch, it will first redirect to the enhanced tool finder, then be later removed.</p>



<p>Rollout of the new enhanced tool finder began on April 25 for select Google Workspace customers, with May 10 marking the next wave of rollouts. Personal Google accounts will also get the update, likely by the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/26/23698756/google-workspace-docs-sheets-slides-search-bar-tool-finder&amp;xcust=2-2-1799717-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">end of May</a>.</p>

## UK blocks Microsoft-Activision deal to protect cloud gaming

<p>Today, the United Kingdom blocks Microsoft&rsquo;s proposed $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard on the grounds that it would hurt cloud gaming.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/605846/microsoft-hopes-to-buy-activision-blizzard-in-a-deal-that-would-make-gaming-history.html">original deal</a>, proposed more than a year ago, would have been the largest acquisition in history. But, according to the UK&rsquo;s Competition and Markets Authority, the deal could undermine the cloud gaming market before it got off the ground, hurting the competition. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393220/microsoft-will-add-free-project-xcloud-gaming-to-xbox-game-pass-ultimate.html">Microsoft launched its cloud gaming service in 2020</a> as Project xCloud, which is now part of its Game Pass Ultimate service. As the UK CMA pointed out, cloud gaming allows consumers with high-speed broadband to avoid paying for a game console. Instead, they can stream games over the Internet, playing them on a remote server. Most of Microsoft&rsquo;s Game Pass Ultimate services (<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/397667/get-3-years-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-tip.html">available for cheap if you know how</a>) are available via cloud gaming. The CMA was afraid of Activision launching its own cloud gaming service. Acquiring Activision would squash that competition, the CMA said.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Allowing Microsoft to take such a strong position in the cloud gaming market just as it begins to grow rapidly would risk undermining the innovation that is crucial to the development of these opportunities,&rdquo; the UK CMA <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/microsoft-activision-deal-prevented-to-protect-innovation-and-choice-in-cloud-gaming&amp;xcust=2-1-1799666-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">said</a> in a statement. According to the CMA, cloud gaming will be worth 1 billion pounds in the UK by 2026.</p>



<p>Microsoft apparently tried to bargain, offering a counteroffer that would govern what games would be available on what platforms over a ten-year period. The CMA ultimately rejected it on the grounds that it did not address cloud gaming, wasn&rsquo;t sufficiently open to other operating systems, and would &ldquo;standardize the terms and conditions on which games are available.&rdquo; </p>



<p>The agency also had concerns with Microsoft raising the price of Game Pass, post-merger. &ldquo;Microsoft engaged constructively with us to try to address these issues and we are grateful for that, but their proposals were not effective to remedy our concerns and would have replaced competition with ineffective regulation in a new and dynamic market,&rdquo; said Martin Coleman, chair of the independent panel of experts conducting the investigation for the U.K.</p>



<h2 id="so-what-now">So, what now?</h2>



<p>Microsoft president Brad Smith said in a statement that the company will appeal. &ldquo;We have already signed contracts to make Activision Blizzard&rsquo;s popular games available on 150 million more devices, and we remain committed to reinforcing these agreements through regulatory remedies,&rdquo; he said.</p>



<p>History does offer some insight on what Microsoft could do. In 2009, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/523517/windows_7_without_internet_explorer_microsoft_explains.html">Microsoft shipped a version of Windows 7 and 7 E</a> to Europe to address concerns that Microsoft was illegally bundling Internet Explorer inside the operating system. But how Microsoft could apply that model to a game service (pull Game Pass out of the UK? Refuse to offer Activision games to UK cloud gaming audiences?) is unclear.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that the UK isn&rsquo;t the only government against the deal &ndash;the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/12/ftc-seeks-block-microsoft-corps-acquisition-activision-blizzard-inc&amp;xcust=2-1-1799666-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">U.S. Federal Trade Commission is too</a>. </p>



<p>Smith&rsquo;s statement does imply that Microsoft intends to go forward with the Activision Blizzard deal. Whether that&rsquo;s still possible or not is in question.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about you, but when it comes to tech accessories, I like a good statement piece or conversation starter. If you&rsquo;re in the market for such an accessory, you&rsquo;re in luck. Amazon&rsquo;s currently selling the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09DKQWTNC&amp;xcust=2-1-1799471-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">AULA F2088 typewriter style gaming keyboard for $39.32</a> (make sure you clip on the extra 5 percent off on-page coupon), which is a savings of $20.67. This keyboard with its rounded keycaps resembles an old fashioned typewriter, which is super unique. Not only is this keyboard drop-dead gorgeous, but it also has a lot of useful features. </p>



<p>The AULA F2088 features mechanical blue switches, dedicated media control keys, 19 different lighting effects, 104 anti-ghosting keys, and a magnetic wrist rest. The blue switches are quick and responsive, which is good news for gamers. There&rsquo;s even a control knob that allows you to switch between media and lighting modes and the anti-ghosting keys help prevent any phantom inputs. The keyboard itself is also made of aluminum alloy and the magnetic wrist rest is designed to alleviate hand fatigue and wrist pain. </p>



<p>This is a great deal, but we don&rsquo;t expect it to last long. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;d recommend swooping in sooner rather than later.</p>

## ChromeOS is getting system-wide camera and microphone toggles

<p>ChromeOS is quickly closing the gap with Windows and MacOS in terms of features, if not in full capability. Yesterday, Google announced a new suite of security measures coming to the platform later this year, designed to provide more options for both standard users and system administrators. A particular highlight is the ability to manually turn off access to the webcam and microphone on a laptop or tablet for all apps, right in the main Settings menu. </p>



<p>At the moment, ChromeOS treats camera and mic access just like the browser does: on a site-by-site and app-by-app basis. This system-wide toggle would override settings for individual websites and, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/chrome-enterprise/protect-business-data-chromeos-data-controls-and-new-security-integrations&amp;xcust=2-1-1799350-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">in the words of Google Cloud&rsquo;s blog post</a>, provide &ldquo;extra confidence in staying on mute.&rdquo; An exact timeframe for the feature to hit current ChromeOS devices was not provided. </p>



<p>The rest of the security features announced in the post are more corporate-focused. Chrome Enterprise customers will allow admins to monitor Chromebooks and other hardware with Crowstrike Falcon Insight XDR, a unified risk assessment and response platform. This lets you monitor USB activity, logins, and use of the common Chrome Remote Desktop tool. New integrations with Azure, Netskipe Intelligent SSE, and Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps will allow conditional directory access as well. </p>

<p>A computer typically works great until it doesn&rsquo;t. The exact problems can vary but, perhaps in your case, it&rsquo;s full up on space. Or you notice the PC drags instead of dashes when retrieving data&mdash;and your system overall is still a top performer.</p>



<p>These two issues can sometimes be fixed by upgrading your storage drive. But how do you know if it&rsquo;s the right time outside of when your drive just ups and bites the dust? After all, swapping for a new part can cost you time as well as money. Before you reach for your screwdriver (and your wallet), ask yourself these questions first.</p>

<h2 id="can-you-clear-files">Can you clear files?</h2>



<p>If you&rsquo;re running out of space, you may be able to offload some files to a different location like the cloud or a second drive, for example. You&rsquo;ll still need to have <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/426736/3-easy-steps-anyone-can-take-now-to-back-up-a-pc.html">a proper backup solution</a>, but the methods you use could eliminate the need to upgrade your PC&rsquo;s boot drive. For example, with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406861/best-external-drives.html">an external hard drive</a>, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/549568/dropbox-vs-google-drive.html">cloud storage service</a>, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407149/online-cloud-backup-services-carbonite-idrive-backblaze-livedrive.html">cloud backup service</a>, you can expand and backup your PC without touching its innards.</p>

<h2 id="is-your-drive-slow">Is your drive slow?</h2>



<p>A storage drive can act sluggish for two main reasons. It might be nearing capacity. It also just might be a hard drive.</p>



<p>Capacity has a surprising effect on drive speed&mdash;as an SSD or HDD starts running out of room, lag can creep in when you open files, save documents, and otherwise interact with the storage drive. This phenomenon doesn&rsquo;t affect all solid state drives, but you may see it occur with older or cheaper models.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1786312" height="506" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-12.png" width="701" /><figcaption>Windows largely handles a lot of this drive &ldquo;optimization,&rdquo;  (aka running TRIM and defragging) but you can still manually run it, too.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Hard disk drives suffer in particular, though. As they fill up, their data gets written to areas that take longer to access. The blocks of data for a single file also start getting written to different areas of the disk. Think of it like storing items in an apartment, where the items you first moved in are closest to the front door, and those you moved in last are farthest away. Meanwhile, as you get rid of unwanted boxes here and there, you start stashing bits of what you need into those open spots. If you enter your home to find a particular outfit, you might need to go farther into the depths of your place (and/or extra time to locate each item) before you can get out the door with everything in hand.</p>



<p>You can sometimes &ldquo;fix&rdquo; the slowness by not using the full capacity of the disk. Staying below about 15 to 20 percent of max usually helps, but if that&rsquo;s not possible, you can <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406367/when-to-check-defrag-and-optimize-storage-devices.html">try running tools like TRIM for an SSD</a> or disk defragmenter for an HDD.</p>



<h2 id="are-you-using-an-hdd-as-your-boot-drive">Are you using an HDD as your boot drive?</h2>



<p>Speaking of slow drives, hard disk drives look like turtles next to SSDs. Sequential read and write speeds usually fall between 80MB to 160MB per second while average SSDs start at speeds of 400MB to 500MB per second&mdash;and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1676119/5-reasons-to-switch-to-a-bleeding-edge-pcie-5-0-ssd-and-5-reasons-not-to.html">climb as high as 10,000MB per second</a>. Even poor performing SSDs, which can drop as low as 200MB per second, can outdo HDDs.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Gigabyte Aorus Gen5 10000 SSD angle" class="wp-image-1780661" height="723" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Aorus-Gen5-10000-b.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><span>Few people need a drive this fast&mdash;you can get the benefits of an SSD with a basic SATA model for far, far less money. </span> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jon L. Jacobi</p></div>



<p>A hard disk drive&rsquo;s more languid pace is fine when you don&rsquo;t need to interact with it frequently, but if you have one as a boot drive, you&rsquo;ll feel its slower speed every time you use your PC for just about anything. Load times for Windows, apps, and documents are all affected.</p>



<p>An upgrade to a modest SATA SSD can make a world of difference&mdash;for an older PC, the switch can make it feel like a whole new computer. It doesn&rsquo;t have to cost much, either. If you catch a 1TB SSD on sale, it&rsquo;s about the same price as a 1TB HDD.</p>



<h2 id="can-you-expand">Can you expand?</h2>



<p>Before you think to replace your existing storage drive, consider first if you want instead to expand your amount of storage. Desktop PCs and laptops alike <em>generally</em> can support more than one storage drive, but that depends on how they&rsquo;re built.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Obviously, if you DIY a desktop PC, you should have the ability to add more than one drive to it. You may need to look in your manual to see exactly which form factors are supported and how many, but you can do it. Same goes for a prebuilt from a company like <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.ibuypower.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1786290-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">iBuyPower</a>, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.cyberpowerpc.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1786290-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">CyberPowerPC</a>, or <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://nzxt.com/category/gaming-pcs/build&amp;xcust=2-1-1786290-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">NZXT</a>, which use off-the-shelf parts when assembling their computers.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="WD BLACK SN850X on MSI motherboard" class="wp-image-917794" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/WD_BLack_SN850X_DSC7322.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Most modern motherboards have more than one M.2 slot for an SSD, and several SATA ports for a HDD or 2.5-inch SSD.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Pickavance / Foundry</p></div>



<p>But if you buy a pre-built PC from a vendor like Dell, Lenovo, or HP&mdash;or buy a laptop&mdash;you&rsquo;ll need to check to see if you have expansion slots available to you. Online searches often will answer this question, but you may need to dig into a manual or technical document on the manufacturer&rsquo;s website if not.</p>



<p>If you can simply add a drive instead of upgrading to a different drive, you can solve capacity problems quickly and with less hassle than replacing your boot drive. However, if your boot drive slowness is caused by it being a hard disk drive, you can&rsquo;t fix that by adding more storage. HDDs are fine for secondary storage, though, if you&rsquo;re not accessing large files often.</p>



<h2 id="how-old-is-your-drive">How old is your drive?</h2>



<p>All computer components have a finite shelf life, including storage drives. When you have to move off your current parts to replacements is a matter of time.</p>

<p>But if you can&rsquo;t afford downtime or want to minimize how much headache it&rsquo;ll be to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407021/best-windows-backup-software.html">restore your files from your backups</a>,, pay attention to how your drive is behaving. You may get warning signs it&rsquo;s about to bite the dust.</p>



<p>Also consider its age (or, perhaps more accurately, its mileage). Is it reaching a point where you might hit the maximum amount of read and write cycles? If you&rsquo;ve used it hard or you&rsquo;ve just run it for many years, it could be worth upgrading and getting onto a fresher (and likely bigger) drive.</p>

<p>There are a lot of variables that go into evaluating a mechanical keyboard. One of the most coveted, and the hardest to quantify, is the &ldquo;feel.&rdquo; Arguably the feeling of tactile typing, and how much better it is than keyboards that use cheaper membranes or other builds, is the reason mechanical boards are now the standard. If a quality feel is what you&rsquo;re after, then you owe it to yourself to check out this entry from Keydous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are a lot of little things that bring down the NJ80-AP&rsquo;s experience: a somewhat retro look, a plastic case, and software that&rsquo;s just plain bad. But with a shocking amount of attention and care given to the typing experience, plus &ldquo;under the hood&rdquo; components that are swinging way out of this thing&rsquo;s price range, it&rsquo;s a compelling alternative to semi-custom offerings from the likes of Keychron or Glorious.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Further reading:</strong> See our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/414972/best-wireless-keyboards.html">best wireless keyboards</a> to learn about competing products.</p></blockquote>



<h2 id="keydous-nj80-ap-design">Keydous NJ80-AP design&nbsp;</h2>



<p>In the car community there&rsquo;s a concept called a &ldquo;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeper_(car)&amp;xcust=2-1-1793350-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sleeper</a>.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a vehicle that looks unassuming on the outside, something that avoids attention and blends into traffic, but hides a roaring engine and other zoom-zoom parts under the hood. In that sense, the NJ80-AP might be called a sleeper keyboard. Its plain white plastic case and 75% layout could be mistaken for something from the &rsquo;90s at a glance, especially if you remove the splashes of color on the space bar, Enter, and Escape keys and go with the white replacements that come in the box.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Keydous NJ80-AP rotary dial" class="wp-image-1794664" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DSC01088.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>Not that there&rsquo;s anything wrong with the 75% layout. It&rsquo;s incredibly functional and efficient, combining the full capability of a TKL keyboard (minus a few rarely used keys like Insert) into a board that&rsquo;s barely wider than a 60%, and the only non-standard keycap is the right Shift key. I also like the way the Delete, Page Up, and Page Down keys get a little separation, the better to avoid errant presses in furious typing sessions. The volume dial is a bit dull, plastic where most boards in this price range go for metal, but it serves its purpose and can &ldquo;click&rdquo; in (assigned to mute by default).&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>A &lsquo;sleeper car&rsquo; blends into traffic but hides a roaring engine under the hood. The NJ80 might be called a sleeper keyboard.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>The keycaps are high-quality PBT plastic, as seen on the best keyboards (and withheld from some of the stingier designs&hellip;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/541284/razer-blackwidow-v3-pro-review-a-wireless-keyboard-with-gaming-audacity.html">Razer</a>). In comparison, the case is a little underwhelming. It&rsquo;s ABS plastic through and through, a rather dull white, and held in place with clips and very difficult to open. You could argue that it&rsquo;s saving weight versus a more premium aluminum build, but this is already a pretty hefty board thanks to its premium interior components and a beefy battery.</p>



<p>The other big feature for this keyboard is wireless. Keydous was ambitious in this area, boasting both Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless options, with a tiny USB dongle that slides out of a dedicated slot in the case. Dual wireless support elevates the NJ80&rsquo;s offerings over more niche contemporaries like Keychron&rsquo;s Bluetooth-only boards, and equals (at least in purely technical terms) the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1676470/logitech-pop-keys-mechanical-keyboard-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">multi-mode wireless keyboards from Logitech</a> and other mainstream brands.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Keydous NJ80-AP bottom with USB dongle" class="wp-image-1794669" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DSC01047.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>It also means that the board is a decent (if not ideal) option for PC gaming, something that Bluetooth-only boards can&rsquo;t boast. Combined with an absolutely massive 4,800mAh battery, it should last for months with the RGB lights turned off&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t drain the battery completely during my testing period.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the bottom of the case you&rsquo;ll find the plastic fold-out feet&mdash;just one stage&mdash;and a dedicated on-off switch which, while certainly appreciated, would have been better placed on the side. The keyboard is pretty aggressive with its battery-saving, taking a second or two to wake up if you haven&rsquo;t been around. Of course, if you prefer not to think about it, you can plug in the included USB-C cable to go full wired.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="hows-the-typing-on-the-keydous-nj80-ap">How&rsquo;s the typing&nbsp;on the Keydous NJ80-AP?</h2>



<p>At this point I&rsquo;ve reviewed dozens of mechanical keyboards, bought another couple dozen for my personal collection, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1479939/i-got-tired-of-waiting-for-a-wireless-gaming-pc-keypad-so-i-made-my-own.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">hand-built another half-dozen</a> on my own. So when I say that the Keydous NJ80 has the best typing experience I&rsquo;ve ever had from a pre-built keyboard, it&rsquo;s no feint praise. This thing feels marvelous to use.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Keydous NJ80-AP switches and lights" class="wp-image-1794670" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DSC01151.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>Why? It&rsquo;s all down to the parts. High-quality keycaps, which I&rsquo;ve already mentioned, are the start. They&rsquo;re a bit slicker than normal PBT plastic, but pleasantly thick and heavy. Underneath them Keydous offers a surprisingly &ldquo;exotic&rdquo; selection of switches with strange-sounding names. For review they offered me a choice of &ldquo;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://mechkeys.com/products/kailh-box-blueberry-ice-cream-pro-switches?variant=43877439963359&amp;xcust=2-1-1793350-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">BOX Blueberry Ice Cream Pro</a>&rdquo; and &ldquo;BOX Strawberry Ice Cream&rdquo; switches from Kailh, and I went with the former.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What makes these switches special, and considerably more desirable and expensive than your          garden variety Cherrys, is a mix of techniques. The linear switches (smooth, no click) are built out of yet another type of plastic, the expensive and high-quality POM (polyoxymethylene) usually seen in precision machining and gears. The switches are also pre-lubed from the factory, with ever-so-slightly lighter springs and shorter travel than standard Reds. Add on top of that the excellent stability and smoothness of Kailh&rsquo;s BOX stems, with their hall effect (the little circle around the cross) that also makes them resistant to water and dust.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Keydous NJ80-AP brass plate and keycaps" class="wp-image-1794667" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DSC01011.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>On top of <em>that</em>, this keyboard uses premium stabilizers that are <em>also </em>pre-lubed from the factory, which eliminates the typical &ldquo;rattle&rdquo; you get when pressing larger keys. (Yes, even the space bar!). Directly under the switches is a full brass plate, offering extra weight and stiffness, with a layer of sound- and vibration-damping foam between the plate and the circuit board. Under the circuit board is a second layer of foam, further insulating the sound and vibration from the case itself.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Keydous NJ80-AP diagram" class="wp-image-1794681" height="1200" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/71s5RjcXjL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Keydous</p></div>



<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of really dense, keyboard-nut jargon. But it all boils down to this: The keyboard feels fantastic while you&rsquo;re typing. The high-quality switches and stabilizers make it buttery-smooth, and the plate and layers of foam give it a satisfying &ldquo;thock&rdquo; feel if you&rsquo;re a heavy typer who bottoms out each keypress, like me. I&rsquo;m not exaggerating when I say it&rsquo;s the best-feeling pre-built keyboard I&rsquo;ve ever used, despite lacking more fancy elements like a gasket mount. It&rsquo;s even better than anything I&rsquo;ve been able to build for myself, with a similar (or higher!) level of high-quality, custom parts.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>It all boils down to this: The keyboard feels fantastic while you&rsquo;re typing. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Keydous offers a wide selection of exotic switches with the NJ80, with weirder names like &ldquo;Gateron Pro Milky Yellow.&rdquo; Whichever you choose, you can try something else, or go with a &ldquo;barebone&rdquo; build without switches or keycaps, because the switch sockets are hot-swappable. As all premium keyboards should be.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="how-is-the-keydous-nj80-aps-software">How is the Keydous NJ80-AP&rsquo;s software?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The typing experience on the NJ80 is its high point, and what a high. Unfortunately it has a matching low point, and that&rsquo;s the software. Instead of the much more standardized and desirable QMK or <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.caniusevia.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1793350-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VIA firmware</a>, Keydous went with a custom driver and layout program available for Windows or Mac, which downloads from a somewhat worrying Google Drive folder <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.keydous.com/xz_keydous&amp;xcust=2-1-1793350-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on its website</a>. It&rsquo;s actually gone through several revisions during my review period, with only a little improvement&mdash;the first version was entirely in Chinese with no obvious language option.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Keydous driver program" class="wp-image-1794682" height="718" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/keydous-driver-program.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>The software boots up slowly, and takes even longer to detect the keyboard. There&rsquo;s still a bit of Chinese text floating around, but it seems to have successfully detected the English system setting in Windows, so at least it&rsquo;s fairly obvious where to go.&nbsp;Remapping is a painfully slow process, so it&rsquo;s a good thing that most people won&rsquo;t need much beyond the 75% layout. I remapped Page Up and Page Down to Print Screen and Play/Pause, respectively, which was far less than straightforward. Each change needs to be &ldquo;confirmed,&rdquo; which appears to be a full flash to the keyboard, and clicking on another key will try to apply that setting there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can go into the Function layer and laboriously see which functions are assigned to the function row. But more complex keyboard operations, like switching Bluetooth devices (Fn+1/2/3, 4 for the 2.4GHz dongle) appears to be locked. Ditto for the RGB lighting controls, which are accomplished with a mix of the Escape, Backspace, and Arrow keys. You can adjust custom lighting in the driver program with the usual mix of distracting &ldquo;gamer&rdquo; lights, but I didn&rsquo;t find any particularly appealing. Your mileage may vary, but even if you&rsquo;re a fan, you&rsquo;ll need to keep the manual handy to learn the controls.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Keydous NJ80-AP manual" class="wp-image-1794671" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DSC01183.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>There appears to be an option to upload and download custom profiles via the &ldquo;share&rdquo; menu. These are slow, and frankly, not really worth it. There&rsquo;s nothing so interesting or complex that you can&rsquo;t do it yourself, though I guess if you really want to make your keyboard flash in a pink heart pattern, this is a faster way to manage it.&nbsp;All in all, I wish Keydous had saved a lot of time and effort and just gone with QMK or VIA software. The tool isn&rsquo;t so bad that it tanks the whole experience&mdash;I managed what few changes I wanted and didn&rsquo;t need to open it again until review time. But I&rsquo;d much rather have something standardized.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="should-you-buy-the-keydous-nj80-ap">Should you buy the Keydous NJ80-AP?</h2>



<p>The closest thing to the Keydous NJ-80, with a 75% wireless build and a focus on quality parts, is <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1502685/keychron-q1-pro-keyboard-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">the excellent Keychron Q1 Pro</a>. And that keyboard has a few distinct advantages over this one: a full metal body, better customization options, and far better software (again, standard QMK/VIA).&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the Keydous has its own pros, namely the option for less laggy 2.4GHz wireless, an insanely long battery life, and that wonderful, wonderful typing feel from super-high-quality switches and pre-lubed stabilizers. Which one you prefer will come down to which aspects of a keyboard you value.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>The NJ80&rsquo;s fantastic typing experience and more flexible wireless options give it a definite edge.&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>And speaking of value: The Keydous NJ-80 costs anywhere from $100-200, depending on where you buy it and whether you get it with keycaps and switches included. But <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09Q55NXHF/?th=1&amp;xcust=2-1-1793350-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on Amazon</a> this particular model, complete with spare keycaps and premium BOX Blueberry Ice Cream Pro switches, is $150 (with a discount down to $135 at the time of writing). That&rsquo;s a considerable savings over similar premium designs, even factoring in the plastic case.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Keydous NJ80-AP all included accessories" class="wp-image-1794666" height="676" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DSC01176.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>So if you can live with a somewhat janky programming tool, and you don&rsquo;t want an aluminum-cased keyboard that can double as a bludgeoning weapon, the NJ-80&rsquo;s fantastic typing experience and more flexible wireless options give it a definite edge.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You know it&rsquo;s a tough quarter for the PC market when Microsoft Surface revenue drops by 30 percent&hellip;and that&rsquo;s <em>good.</em></p>



<p>Microsoft reported better-than-expected revenues for the first calendar quarter of 2023, but Microsoft&rsquo;s More Personal Computing remained a black mark: It was the only division to experience a revenue drop, down 9 percent to $13.3 billion.</p>



<p>Of all the various businesses grouped together in that business unit, two numbers stuck out: Windows OEM revenue fell 28 percent, and Devices (Surface) revenue fell by 30 percent. That&rsquo;s a signal that Microsoft&rsquo;s PC customers saw about a 28 percent drop in sales, while Surface devices fell by 30 percent, or slightly more. IDC (owned by PCWorld&rsquo;s parent, IDG) previously reported that PC sales fell by 29 percent to 56.9 million during the first quarter of 2023.</p>



<p>So it was a little surprising to hear chief financial officer Amy Hood present those numbers to analysts, then add that they were actually <em>ahead</em> of expectations. Hood explained that Microsoft actually saw <em>better</em> than expected PC demand, particularly in the commercial segment. Unfortunately for Microsoft, revenue was &ldquo;negatively impacted by elevated channel inventory levels.&rdquo;</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s bad, if you&rsquo;re a Microsoft shareholder. But that&rsquo;s great news if you&rsquo;re a consumer, since &ldquo;elevated channel inventory&rdquo; simply means &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a lot of unsold PCs sitting on store shelves.&rdquo; To get rid of those unsold PCs, the traditional way has been through sales, discounts, promotions, bundles&mdash;all ways to entice you to buy. There&rsquo;s a reason why we track the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/550968/best-laptop-deals-3.html">best deals that you can find on laptops,</a> almost daily. </p>



<p>Hood also told analysts that conditions in the PC market should persist: Revenue should tick up slightly to between $13.35 to $13.75 billion, but PC demand should remain unchanged and channel inventory should remain elevated. The bottom line: Expect laptop sales to continue.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Though channel inventory has depleted in the last few months, it&rsquo;s still well above the healthy four to six week range,&rdquo; said&nbsp;Jitesh Ubrani, research manager for IDC&rsquo;s&nbsp;Mobility and Consumer Device Trackers, earlier this month. &ldquo;Even with heavy discounting, channels and PC makers can expect elevated inventory to persist into the middle of the year and potentially into the third quarter.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Those sales (actual sales!) may extend to Xbox as well. Xbox hardware revenue fell by a whopping 30 percent&mdash;in Hood&rsquo;s words, because of &ldquo;increased console supply,&rdquo; and offset by better than expected monetization. Translated, that means that Xbox hardware is finally outselling consumer demand, implying more sales are on their way. If there&rsquo;s any downside, it&rsquo;s that game makers are finding ways to lure gamers into buying additional add-ons&mdash;which may be DLC, or not. </p>



<p>It&rsquo;s sometimes easy to fall into the language that Wall Street employs: earnings are down, so it&rsquo;s time to break out the waterworks. In this case, both consumers and Microsoft have something to cheer about: Microsoft&rsquo;s cloud business continued to buoy revenues and profits, so that Microsoft reported net income ($18.3 billion, up 9 percent) and revenue ($52.9 billion, up 7 percent) that exceeded expectations.</p>



<p>But for you, the future seems assured: The PC sales will continue until sales improve.</p>
