Launch performance issues aside, it\u2019s a sequel that does virtually everything better than the original \u2013 which was already an exceptional Star Wars game. If Respawn makes one more like this it\u2019ll be the best Star Wars trilogy in 30 years, hands down.\"", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMPzks0pq0", "date_published": "2023-04-26 15:00:41+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Will Let You Save Build Designs", "description": "Building custom vehicles and devices are a BIG part of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and it turns out you won't have to rebuild your favorite designs every time!\n\n#IGN #Gaming #Zelda", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYIPNpfBnAM", "date_published": "2023-04-26 15:00:15+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Here's How Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Improves Cooking", "description": "Cooking hearty, fulfilling, and occasionally dubious meals was an integral part of survival in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and it's back in Tears of the Kingdom with some awesome new upgrades.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #Zelda", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOQqGv2nKg0", "date_published": "2023-04-26 14:15:03+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "How The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is Changing Weapon Durability", "description": "If you weren't crazy about your weapons breaking in Breath of the Wild, we've got some good news for you, assuming you have enough resources in your pockets!\n\n#IGN #Gaming #Zelda", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYLoiMklBWA", "date_published": "2023-04-26 13:30:13+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - We Played it for Hours!", "description": "After years of anticipation, we've finally gone hands-on with The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and we can't wait to tell you all about this massive open world game in our spoiler-free preview.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #Zelda", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sRMNwwLsc0", "date_published": "2023-04-26 13:00:22+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Alien: Isolation\u2019s Terrifying Introduction to the Perfect Predator - Art of the Level", "description": "Watch our Alien Isolation Art of the Level video on Alien Day 2023!
