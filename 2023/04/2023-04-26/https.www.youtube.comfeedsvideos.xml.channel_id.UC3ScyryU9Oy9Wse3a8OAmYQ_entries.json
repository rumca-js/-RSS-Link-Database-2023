The series conclusion also examines the legacy and toll of America\u2019s longest war, and what the U.S. left behind when it withdrew \u2014 from hundreds of Afghans trying to board planes to safety, to women and girls facing restrictions and repression under Taliban rule.\n\nWatch all three parts of the series now. \n\n\u201cAmerica and the Taliban\u201d is a FRONTLINE production with RAIN Media, Inc.
