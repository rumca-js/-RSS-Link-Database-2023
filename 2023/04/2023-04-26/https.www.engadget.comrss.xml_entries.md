<p>Mark Zuckerberg’s “year of efficiency” doesn’t seem to be affecting Facebook’s growth. Meta’s social network added 37 million users during the <a href="https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2023/q1/Meta-03-31-2023-Exhibit-99-1-FINAL-v2.pdf">first quarter</a> of the year, bringing total daily users up to 2.037 billion. Meanwhile, the number of daily users across the company’s “family of apps” rose to over 3 billion users for the first time in company history.</p><p>The company reported the growth in its first-quarter earnings report for 2023, the first since Zuckerberg announced the company was focusing on “efficiency” amid an economic downturn that has led the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-begins-its-latest-round-of-layoffs-145019127.html">to shed</a> thousands of jobs. That shift seems to be showing some signs of success, as Meta reported $28.6 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 3 percent from last year and the first revenue growth in nearly a year for Meta.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Despite the boost, though, Zuckerberg confirmed that more layoffs are still scheduled to take place next month. “Even as our financial position improves, I continue to believe that slowing hiring, flattening our management structure, increasing the percent of our company that is technical and more rigorously prioritizing projects will improve the speed and quality of our work,” he said during a call with analysts.</p><p>Reality Labs also continues to take major losses, losing just under $4 billion for the quarter. That’s a bit less than the $4.3 billion the company lost last quarter, but Meta has said it expects 2023 losses for its metaverse division to top the $14.3 billion it lost last year.</p><p>During the call, Zuckerberg said the company is still prioritizing its massive investment in the metaverse, even as it increasingly turns its attention to generative AI. “A narrative has developed that we're moving away from focusing on the metaverse vision,” Zuckerberg said. “So I just want to say upfront that that's not accurate. We've been focusing on both AI and the metaverse for years now, and we will continue to focus on both.” He added that the company was preparing to launch its “next-generation consumer virtual and mixed reality device” later in the year.</p><p>Meta’s CEO also talked more about his plan to create <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-is-working-on-ai-personas-for-instagram-messenger-and-whatsapp-223316961.html">“AI agents”</a> and other generative AI tools for the company’s apps. “I think that there's an opportunity to introduce AI agents to billions of people in ways that will be useful and meaningful. We're exploring chat experiences in WhatsApp and messenger, visual creation tools for posts on Facebook and Instagram and ads, and, over time, video and multimodal experiences as well.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at

<p>On Wednesday, a group of contractors at YouTube Music voted to unionize with the Alphabet Workers Union-Communications Workers of America (AWU-CWA). Out of the 49 workers who were eligible to vote, 41 voted in favor of the action, with the remaining eight abstaining. As of last year, the workers were <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-music-content-operations-contractors-union-184653045.html">already paying AWU-CWA dues</a> but were seeking bargaining rights.

## This OLED screen can fill with liquid to form tactile buttons

<p>Swiping and tapping on flat screens is something we’ve learned to deal with in smartphones, tablets and other touchscreen gizmos, but it doesn’t come close to the ease of typing on a hardware keyboard or playing a game with a physical controller. To that end, researchers Craig Shultz and Chris Harrison with the <a href="https://www.figlab.com">Future Interfaces Group (FIG)</a> at Carnegie Mellon University have created a display that can protrude screen areas in different configurations. It’s a concept <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-02-12-phorm-tactus-ipad-case.html">we’ve seen before</a>, but this version is thinner, lighter and more versatile.</p><p>FIG’s “Flat Panel Haptics” tech can be stacked under an OLED panel to create the protrusions: imagine screen sections that can be inflated and deflated with fluid on demand. This could add a new tactile dimension for things like pop-up media controls, keyboards and virtual gamepads you can find without fumbling around on the screen. As <em>Gizmodo</em><a href="https://gizmodo.com/carnegie-mellon-touchscreen-pop-up-buttons-1850377517">notes</a>, haptic feedback like Apple’s Taptic Engine produces natural-feeling vibrations but doesn’t help you find onscreen elements by touch alone. For activities like typing and playing games that require rapid-fire response time, a screen with pop-up elements could make things much less frustrating.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Embedded Electroosmotic Pumps (EEOPs) are arrays of fluid pumps on a thin actuation layer built into a touchscreen device, like a smartphone or car display. When an onscreen element requires a pop-up button, fluid fills a section of the EEOP layer, and the OLED panel on top bends to take that shape. The result is a “button” that sticks out from the flat surface by as much as 1.5 mm, enough to feel the difference. When the software dismisses it, it recedes back into the flat display. The research team says filling each area takes about one second, and they feel solid to touch.</p><figure><img alt="Closeup of a finger touching an inflated space bar on a protruding onscreen keyboard on a smartphone." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/38c36500-e466-11ed-bbbd-2ab62487e522" style="height: 1038px; width: 1730px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Future Interfaces Group at Carnegie Mellon</div></figure><p>If the concept sounds familiar (and you’ve been following consumer tech long enough), this tech may remind you of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-06-06-tactus-technology-prototype-android-tablet-shows-off-shapeshifti.html">Tactus’ rising touchscreen keyboard</a>, which ultimately shipped as a bulky iPad mini case. FIG’s prototype can take on more dynamic shapes and sizes, and the research team says their version’s thinness sets it apart from similar attempts. “The main advantage of this approach is that the entire mechanical system exists in a compact and thin form factor,” FIG said in its narration for a demo video. “Our device stack-ups are under 5mm in thickness while still offering 5mm of displacement. Additionally, they are self-contained, powered only by a pair of electrical cables and control electronics. They’re also lightweight (under 40 grams for this device), and they are capable of enough force to withstand user interaction.”</p><p>The researchers see this as a tactile equivalent to the way pixels work on displays. “Much like LCD pixels, which modulate light from a common backlight, EEOPs draw from a common fluid reservoir and selectively modulate hydraulic pressure in and out of haptic cells.”</p><p>The pop-up buttons in their current form have a limited scope of shapes and sizes, reducing their versatility. But if they can eventually apply the same principle to a layer with more / smaller pop-up buttons (essentially “higher resolution” if we’re extending the “pixels” metaphor), it could open new doors for user interaction, including easier onscreen typing, gaming, in-car controls and even accessibility features like onscreen braille.</p><div id="64f7655e18014a70bbfb07027232d30c"></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/this-oled-screen-can-fill-with-liquid-to-form-tactile-buttons-204829553.html?src=rss

<p>Amazon is shutting down its Halo division. In <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-halo-discontinued">an email</a> the company sent to users on Wednesday, it said it would stop supporting all devices under the health brand, including the recently released <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-halo-rise-review-an-unobtrusive-bedside-sleep-tracker-thats-surprisingly-helpful-130037788.html">Halo Rise sleep tracker</a>, on July 31st, 2023. As part of the shutdown, Amazon is also laying off an unspecified number of employees. The company did not immediately respond to Engadget's comment request.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“We have made the difficult decision to wind down the Halo program, which will result in role reductions,” Melissa Cha, the company vice-president of smart home and health, told staffers in a memo obtained by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/26/23699459/amazon-layoffs-halo-fitness-tracking-sleep-tracking"><em>The Verge</em></a>. “More recently, Halo has faced significant headwinds, including an increasingly crowded segment and an uncertain economic environment. Although our customers love many aspects of Halo, we must prioritize resources and maximize benefits to customers and the long-term health of the business.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In its email to Halo users, Amazon said it would fully refund all Halo device and accessory purchases made in the last 12 months. The company will also refund any unused prepaid Halo subscription fees. If you were paying month-to-month for service, you won't be charged any additional subscription fees. Come August 1st, the Halo companion app will stop functioning, as will all Halo devices. If you wish to download or delete your data, you can do so from the software's Settings menu. Amazon will erase all remaining data on August 1st. You can send your soon-to-be potatoes to the company for disposal through the <a href="https://amazonrecycling-us.re-teck.com/recycling/home">Amazon Recycling Program</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The demise of the Halo brand shouldn't come as a surprise.

Amazon was also late to the health and fitness segment. It announced the first product in the family, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-halo-fitness-platform-134146361.html">Halo Band</a>, in mid-2020, and it arrived without much fanfare, in part due to the fact some of its features were controversial.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/amazon-will-shut-down-its-halo-health-service-on-july-31st-195652188.html?src=rss

<p>Following a limited test that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-phone-link-supports-limited-iphone-syncing-in-preview-140005285.html"><ins>began in late February</ins></a>, Microsoft has <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2023/04/26/phone-link-for-ios-is-now-rolling-out-to-all-windows-11-customers/"><ins>begun rolling out</ins></a> iPhone support within its Phone Link app to the wider Windows 11 user base. The software, for the uninitiated, allows you to sync your calls, messages and contacts to your PC. Microsoft has offered Phone Link (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-phone-link-your-phone-175356621.html"><ins>in various forms</ins></a>) on Android devices since as far back as 2015. Microsoft expects to roll out iOS support to all Windows 11 users by mid-May.</p><p>Once you have access to the feature, the easiest way to link your devices together is to type “Phone Link” into Windows 11’s search bar. Coincidently, that’s also the best way to find out if you have access to the feature too. If you’re like me, you will probably see the option to add an iPhone grayed out, with the icon noting it’s “coming soon.” Once the feature does arrive, it’s also worth noting there are some limitations. As with the Insider test, you can’t use the app to send images and videos from your Windows machine. Group messaging also isn’t supported. Additionally, the software works on a session basis, so your latest messages will only come through when your iPhone and PC are connected.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Still, even when you consider all those limitations, iPhone-carrying Windows users are sure to appreciate the integration offered by Phone Link, particularly since most people might not be familiar with options like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-unison-iphone-android-windows-pc-integration-162018285.html"><ins>Unison</ins></a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/airdroid-file-transfer-share/id1194539178"><ins>AirDroid</ins></a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-starts-rolling-out-ios-support-for-phone-link-syncing-to-all-windows-11-users-181521677.html?src=rss

While the system itself is simply designed to integrate large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT-4 or Google's BERT into privately-operated networks, the very first thing they did was apply it to the modern battlefield.</p><div id="75f58100f44743269d75b12448b38b80"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>In the video demo above, a military operator tasked with monitoring the Eastern European theater discovers enemy forces massing near the border and responds by asking a ChatGPT-style digital assistant for help with deploying reconnaissance drones, ginning up tactical responses to the perceived aggression and even organize the jamming of the enemy's communications. The AIP is shown helping estimate the enemy's composition and capabilities by launching a Reaper drone on a reconnaissance mission in response the to operator's request for better pictures, and suggesting appropriate responses given the discovery of an armored element.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“LLMs and algorithms must be controlled in this highly regulated and sensitive context to ensure that they are used in a legal and ethical way,” the video begins. To do so, AIP's operation is based on three &quot;key pillars,&quot; the first being that AIP will deploy across a classified system, able to parse in real-time both classified and non-classified data, ethically and legally. The company did not elaborate on how that would work. The second pillar is that users will be able to toggle the scope and actions of every LLM and asset on the network. The AIP itself will generate a secure digital record of the entire operation, &quot;crucial for mitigating significant legal, regulatory, and ethical risks in sensitive and classified settings,&quot; according to the demo. The third pillar are AIP's &quot;industry-leading guardrails&quot; to prevent the system from taking unauthorized actions.&nbsp;</p><p>A &quot;human in the loop&quot; to prevent such actions does exist in Palantir's scenario, though from the video, the &quot;operator&quot; appears to do little more than nod along with whatever AIP suggests. The demo also did not elaborate on what steps are being taken to prevent the LLMs that the system relies on from &quot;hallucinating&quot; pertinent facts and details.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/palantir-shows-off-an-ai-that-can-go-to-war-180513781.html?src=rss

## Bipartisan Senate bill would require parental consent for teens to use social media

<p>A bipartisan group of senators has introduced a bill that seeks to protect kids from the potentially harmful effects of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/social-media/"><ins>social media</ins></a>. The <a href="https://www.schatz.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/protecting_kids_on_social_media_act_2023.pdf"><ins>Protecting Kids on Social Media Act</ins></a> would set 13 as the minimum age for using social media platforms, in line with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/coppa/"><ins>COPPA</ins></a>) and the current terms of many major services. Those aged between 13 and 17 would need parental consent to use social media apps, while platforms would not be allowed to use algorithms to recommend content to under 18s.</p><p>Democratic Sens. Brian Schatz and Chris Murphy introduced the bill alongside their Republican counterparts Tom Cotton and Katie Britt. The proposed legislation seeks to employ age verification technology, though it would prevent companies from using age verification data for other purposes. Were it to become law, the bill would establish a pilot program to offer platforms a government-provided age verification system. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and state attorneys general would have jurisdiction over the bill's provisions.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;Studies have shown a strong relationship between social media use and poor mental health, especially among children,&quot; the senators said in a press release. &quot;With this clear evidence, the US Surgeon General <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/29/health/surgeon-general-social-media/index.html"><ins>has warned</ins></a> that 13 is too early for social media use and suggested that 16, 17, or 18 may be as well.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The alarm bells about social media’s devastating impact on kids have been sounding for a long time, and yet time and time again, these companies have proven they care more about profit than preventing the well-documented harm they cause,&quot; Murphy said. &quot;In particular, these algorithms are sending many down dangerous online rabbit holes, with little chance for parents to know what their kids are seeing online.”</p><p>This is hardly the first time that federal legislators have introduced bills in an attempt to protect children as they use online services. Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Richard Blumenthal last year introduced the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/senate-kids-online-safety-act-bill-141708555.html"><ins>Kids Online Safety Act</ins></a>, which aimed to block platform holders from offering algorithmic recommendations to under 16s. Such companies would have been required to disable &quot;addictive&quot; features and offer kids tools to help them protect their data. The bill didn't make it out of committee before the end of the last congressional session.</p><p>Blumenthal and Sen. Dick Durbin <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/395/text?s=7&amp;r=1&amp;q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22kids+online+safety%22%5D%7D"><ins>introduced a bill</ins></a> in February that would give people the right to delete details of their internet activity that companies collected before they turned 13. In a related case as part of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/epic-games-ftc-settlement-fortnite-170857237.html"><ins>an FTC settlement</ins></a> related to COPPA, Epic Games last year agreed to delete <em>Fortnite</em> players' personal data unless they claimed to be 13 or older.</p><p>The Protecting Kids on Social Media Act follows similar efforts at state level. Last month, Utah became the first state to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/utah-passes-laws-requiring-parental-permission-for-teens-to-use-social-media-223302739.html"><ins>require parental consent</ins></a> for under-18s to use social media. The legislation grants parents full access to their children'' accounts, including private messages. The laws are set to take effect next March, but it's not yet clear how they'll be enforced.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/bipartisan-senate-bill-would-require-parental-consent-for-teens-to-use-social-media-172601557.html?src=rss

<p>LG has officially launched the SuperSlim, the new Gram laptop the company is calling the “thinnest LG Gram ever.” This is <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lg-usa-announces-slimmest-lg-gram-laptop-ever-301807959.html?tc=eml_cleartime"><ins>not just advertising hyperbole</ins></a>, as the SuperSlim is .43-inches thick and weighs two pounds. That definitely places the laptop in the realm of the ultra-portable. As a comparison, the 2022 Macbook Air is 0.44-inches thick and weighs 2.7 pounds.</p><p>The laptop was first teased at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-gram-2023-ultraslim-style-2-in-2-laptops-180038676.html"><ins>this year’s CES</ins></a>, back when it was called the Ultraslim. Not a lot has changed since the original announcement, aside from the name. The SuperSlim boasts decent specs, with an Intel Evo 13th Gen processor and Intel Iris Xe GPU. There is also a 15.6-inch anti-glare OLED display and LG touts a 100 percent DCI-P33 color gamut and VESA DisplayHDR True Black integration. It is worth noting  that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/developer-logs-suggest-apples-long-rumored-15-inch-macbook-air-could-arrive-soon-154131810.html">Apple is rumored to be launching</a> its own 15-inch ultra-portable laptop in the near future.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>LG says the SuperSlim has passed seven tests to ensure military-grade durability, which is a good thing as we have noted some <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-30-lg-gram-17-review-price-specs-big-screen-thin-light.html"><ins>issues with previous Gram laptops</ins></a> surrounding flexibility and build quality. Other standout features include a more compact power adapter than previous Gram laptops, a full HD camera with integrated microphones and a trio of USB-C ports, two of which support Thunderbolt 4 connections.</p><p>This emaciated wonder is available now in two SKUs.

<p>Philips Hue might command much of the attention when it comes to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-smart-led-light-bulbs-143022856.html"><ins>smart light bulbs</ins></a>, but there are other options that allow you to control your home lighting from your phone without having to spend quite as much.

## Laya's Horizon, a sandbox wingsuit game from the studio behind Alto's Odyssey, arrives May 2nd

<p><em>Laya's Horizon</em> is the next big mobile game from Snowman, the studio behind <em>Alto's Adventure</em> and <em>Alto's Odyssey</em>, and it'll be available to play on May 2nd. While both Alto games were exclusive to iOS at launch, <em>Laya's Horizon</em> will hit iOS and Android devices simultaneously, and it'll be ad-free and cost $0 for anyone with a Netflix account.</p><p><em>Laya's Horizon</em> is Snowman's most ambitious game yet, and its launch trailer showcases a vast mountaintop world as it introduces the game's main mechanic — zipping through the air in a wingsuit. The main character soars among various biomes, falling rapidly and grazing the edges of cliffs, trees and villages, collecting yellow gems along the way. The map is densely populated with plant life and man-made structures, while the sea stretches beyond, always within view.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>I've spent some time playing <em>Laya's Horizon</em>, and it's clear that this is more complex and fast-paced than either Alto game, with more opportunities to crash and burn, but also more room to learn and grow. It's an engaging, cozy and responsive experience — I'll share more impressions about it closer to launch day.</p><p>Snowman partnered with Netflix for <em>Laya's Horizon</em>, and it's not the only indie studio working with the streaming company nowadays. Netflix is making a big and, so far, successful push into video game publishing and development, bringing titles like <em>Spiritifarer </em>and <em>Into the Breach</em> to mobile platforms for the first time. Netflix even purchased the team behind <em>Oxenfree</em>, Night School Studio, which is preparing to release <em>Oxenfree II: Lost Signals</em> this July.</p><div id="e01b8aa3f37043b99da157b47e155415"></div>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/layas-horizon-a-sandbox-wingsuit-game-from-the-studio-behind-altos-odyssey-arrives-may-2nd-150033749.html?src=rss

<p>There’s a lot to keep track of as a new mom. All of a sudden, you’re scrambling to learn how to care for a tiny person, without sleep and with a lot of new responsibilities. It’s a rough adjustment that takes time, patience and probably at least a few crying jags to get the hang of. If you’re looking for the perfect gift for a new mother, give her time to sleep. If you’re looking for the next best thing, try these helpful gadgets that are designed to make the job at least a little easier.</p><h2>Hatch Rest+</h2><p></p><p>Having a soft light on during nighttime feeds and diaper changes can be really helpful, especially when you’re sleep deprived.

## The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom hands-on: A sequel with endless creative potential

<p>Making a follow-up to <em>Breath of the Wild</em> (BoTW) is an almost impossible task. Not only was the first Zelda game on the Nintendo Switch an instant classic, it’s also one of the best games in an incredibly storied franchise. To make things even more difficult, <em>Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> features the same basic graphics, map layout and general mechanics as its predecessor, which can sometimes make follow-ups feel more like an expansion pack instead of a true sequel. But after getting a chance to play a hands-on preview build of <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, I think Nintendo might have just pulled it off by making a game that expands upon the original and then blasting it into the sky (literally) with a new world of creation.</p><p>Now before we get into the preview itself, I should mention that this build didn’t touch on any of <em>Tears of the Kingdom’s</em> (ToTK) story. The demo strictly focused on showing off Link’s new abilities in a small area that had me battling through a Bokoblin camp before exploring some of the game's new sky islands. Now this may sound a bit contrived, but it makes a ton of sense because where <em>ToTK </em>shines is when you start combining Link’s new skills – Ascend, Recall, Fuse and Ultrahand – with his returning arsenal of items and weapons.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="One neat thing about the Ascend ability is that once you get to the top, you have the option of jumping out or going back down to where you came from. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/e1631c60-e393-11ed-bfbc-7a5c5a88c50a" style="height: 1080px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption>One neat thing about the Ascend ability is that once you get to the top, you have the option of jumping out or going back down in case you emerge next to a bunch of enemies.&nbsp;</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nintendo</div></figure><p>I’m going to start with Ascend and Recall because they are the most straightforward of the four. Ascend is a simple movement ability that lets you move through rock and other materials. The caveat is that, like its name implies, you can only go up and to make the ability work, you need to have some sort of ceiling relatively close above your head. It’s a great way to get to the top of a mountain or tower when you’re exploring a cavern or room below, and from there you can use your glider to soar to other locations. I should also mention that while the general topography is largely the same, Nintendo has altered a lot of previous locations for <em>TotK</em> while adding a bunch of new content with those sky islands.</p><p>Meanwhile, Recall is a lot like the Stasis ability from <em>BotW</em>, but in reverse. By targeting an object, you can then rewind time and return it to where it came from. This allows you to use falling rocks as elevators (which is super convenient for getting to sky islands), though you can also use it offensively as well. For example, in that aforementioned camp the baddies tried rolling a boulder at me, only for it to backfire when I used Recall to send the rock straight back at them as if Link was bowling for Bokoblins. Trust me, it’s even more satisfying than it sounds, and it only gets better when you can combo Recall with other attacks like bombs and arrows, which brings us to Fuse.</p><div id="195e334251f447c9b4a07dfcdf0b2baf"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>In a lot of ways, Fuse makes me feel sorry for other developers because it's an ability that’s wildly fun but seems like a nightmare to program due to all the possible combos. In short, it lets you combine pretty much any one item – from plants to stuff like bombs – with any one of your weapons to often surprising outcomes. In <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=89f68c82-f255-44fa-8db9-03fec996b93a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YouTube&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4OWY2OGM4Mi1mMjU1LTQ0ZmEtOGRiOS0wM2ZlYzk5NmI5M2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1hNnFuYS1aQ2J4QSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZjM0YTdlODMtNzBlYi00MDRlLWFkOTYtN2QwNDU0ZDdiYzE3In0&amp;signature=AQAAAS5jWzh9UWD4dY6jfZDH00pCM1Nf7qXoQbKb4A05zWIf&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Da6qna-ZCbxA"><ins>Nintendo’s gameplay demo</ins></a>, you can see series producer Eijii Aonuma demonstrating a few combos, but when you finally start messing around with things on your own, the results can be astounding. You can fuse various crystals to arrows to unleash powerful elemental attacks. Alternatively, I fused a frond to a stick to create a hilarious mid-range air attack that feels like you're beating someone up with the fan from <em>Smash Bros.</em> And because you can fuse items lying on the ground with one of your weapons in the middle of a fight, it encourages you to be resourceful during battle.</p><p>There are also a lot of handy utility combos like fusing a light-emitting plant to an arrow to illuminate caves and such. Not only does this give spelunking a moody almost <em>Dark Souls</em>-like vibe at times, it’s also an expansion to gameplay as lighting has a direct effect on how you experience new areas. And if that wasn’t enough, combining items also increases the durability and strength of the base items, so you’re incentivized to try out a wide variety of fusions.</p><figure><img alt="The new Recall ability lets you reverse the course of an object, sending it back where it came from sometimes to devastating results.

Ultrahand allows you to build machines using nearby materials and from what I’ve played the possibilities are endless. It reminds of the old Skyrim meme that goes “See that mountain? You can climb it,” except that in <em>TotK’s</em> case, it’s more like “Imagine a vehicle? You can build it.”</p><p>Contraptions can be as simple as a raft or as complicated as a plane, and by using special Zonai devices which can take the form of fans, rockets and more along with some sort of built-in batteries (the demo didn’t explain where or how to upgrade power sources), you can use these devices to traverse the world like Aladdin on a magic carpet ride. But it’s better because the carpet is of your design.</p><figure><img alt="I wonder what would happen if you fused a rocket to a shield?" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/8bbcec80-e395-11ed-bb77-ca0c1082f18d" style="height: 1080px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption>I wonder what would happen if you fused a rocket to a shield?</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nintendo</div></figure><p>On some level, I have to imagine that Ultrahand was partly inspired by all the crazy contraptions created by players in BotW, and now Nintendo is doubling down on that creativity. Even without doing anything related to the story, I can already see myself getting totally lost in a world of my own creation. For example, in the demo area there was a conveniently placed pile of wooden boards and wheels. So naturally I took 10 minutes to arrange them into a crude war wagon. Then I attached a steering wheel, fans in back for propulsion and flamethrowers up front for extra damage, only to have the whole thing burn up as soon as I drove into some tall grass. It was such an anti-climatic (but hilarious) end to my newly constructed vehicle and I couldn’t wait to do it again. But next time with some metal parts.</p><p>The one downside to Ultrahand (if there is one) is that it definitely takes some time to get used to the controls. It’s almost like Nintendo dropped a streamlined version of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/346010/Besiege/"><em><ins>Besiege</ins></em></a> into <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, which is great because you get a lot of freedom on how to put things together. However, moving and rotating each piece so that it attaches properly to your vehicle requires some patience. Thankfully, for those less interested in building their own vehicles, I can confirm that there is a streamlined way of making new contraptions with a couple simple button taps. (I can’t say much more right now.)</p><figure><img alt="In Tears of the Kingdom, you can use the Ultrahand ability to create all sorts of both ground and air-based vehicles. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/b31e19c0-e395-11ed-b977-257b25cf5f4e" style="height: 1080px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption>In Tears of the Kingdom, you can use the Ultrahand ability to create all sorts of both ground and air-based vehicles.&nbsp;</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nintendo</div></figure><p>After my 75-minute demo session, all I could think about were the endless number combos and possibilities I wanted to try. It feels like Nintendo has really leaned into the sandbox nature of the previous Zelda game, and even without touching the story I can already tell how easy it will be to get sidetracked by <em>Tears of the Kingdom’s</em> creative opportunities. But my biggest takeaway is that coming from <em>Breath of the Wild</em> – which was a game so good it made me rethink how I score video games – <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> is already giving off similar vibes of magic and wonder. In a lot ways, <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> could be what <em>Majora’s Mask</em> is to <em>The Ocarina of Time</em>. You have the same engine, the same map, and the same basic mechanics, but with building and fusing instead of playful masks and that divisive three-day cycle. Some of <em>Tears of the Kindgom’s</em> new abilities might not be your cup of tea, but even so, it’s already feeling like a must-play.</p><p>The <em>Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> goes on sale on May 12th for the Nintendo Switch.</p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-hands-on-preview-a-sequel-with-endless-creative-potential-130047291.html?src=rss

In a statement, the body said the deal risks harming the nascent cloud-gaming market by creating a monopoly player. It said that Microsoft would have a market share of between 60 and 70 percent, giving it an “incentive to withhold [Activision Blizzard] games from competitors and substantially weaken competition in this important growing market.”</p><p><em>This breaking news story is developing, please refresh for more information.</em></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/uk-regulator-blocks-microsofts-activision-blizzard-merger-over-cloud-concerns-113517255.html?src=rss

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/watch-japans-ispace-try-to-land-on-the-moon-today-at-1240pm-et-161525731.html">ispace's Hakuto-R</a> Mission 1 was poised to make history. It was going to be the first successful moon landing by a private company and the first Japanese lunar landing overall. But shortly before the spacecraft was supposed to touch down on the lunar surface, ispace lost contact with it. Now, the Japanese company has <a href="https://ispace-inc.com/news-en/?p=4655">announced</a> that there was a &quot;high probability that the lander eventually made a hard landing on the moon's surface.&quot; It didn't use the word &quot;crash,&quot; but the spacecraft is clearly not in a condition that would allow the company to proceed with the mission.&nbsp;</p><p>The spacecraft was scheduled to land on the moon on April 26th at 1:40 AM Japan time (April 25th, 12:40PM Eastern time). ispace said it was able to confirm that the lander was in vertical position as it approached the surface and that its descent speed rapidly increased by the time its propellant was almost gone.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>By 8AM Japan time, ispace has determined that &quot;Success 9&quot; of Hakuto-R's mission milestones, which is the completion of its lunar landing, was no longer achievable. The company has yet to detail what happened to the spacecraft and what the root cause of the failure was, but it's currently analyzing the telemetry data it had acquired and will announce its findings once it's done.&nbsp;</p><p>Hakuto-R launched on top of a SpaceX rocket around 100 days ago, carrying payloads from NASA, JAXA, as well as the UAE's first lunar rover called Rashid. While the mission failed to reach its ultimate goal, ispace said it was &quot;able to acquire valuable data and know-how from the beginning to nearly the end of the landing sequence&quot; and that it will use what it has learned from this event to enable a &quot;future successful lunar landing mission.&quot; The company still intends to push through with Mission 2 scheduled for launch in 2024 and Mission 3 for 2025.</p><div id="0784edfb82804ced83938299a039ded6"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">ispace will continue to make the most of the data and know-how acquired during the operation through Success 8, and landing sequence, including aspects of Success 9, aiming to dramatically improve the technological maturity of Mission 2 in 2024 and Mission 3 in 2025.

## 'Indiana Jones 5' will feature a de-aged Harrison Ford for the first 25 minutes

<p>A young Harrison Ford will grace cinema screens for 25 minutes this summer — aided by some new Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) software. The news that LucasFilm's <em>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny</em> would feature a de-aged Ford came at the end of last year, but an interview with director James Mangold in <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/indiana-jones-5-deaging-harrison-ford-dial-of-destiny/"><em>Total Film</em></a> just revealed it will be for almost a fifth of the film's running time.&nbsp;</p><p>The fifth<em> Indiana Jones</em> iteration starts with an opening scene from 1944 — about eight years after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/indiana-jones-ultra-hd-blu-ray-045052997.html"><em>Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark</em></a> took place. &quot;My hope is that, although it will be talked about in terms of technology, you just watch it and go, ‘Oh my God, they just found footage. This was a thing they shot 40 years ago,&quot; Kathleen Kennedy, president of Lucasfilm and a producer, told <a href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/indiana-jones-5-opening-sequence-de-ages-harrison-ford-exclusive/"><em>Empire</em></a>. The rest of the movie shoots forward to 1969, with Indy on a mission to prevent a comeback of Nazism.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The news of Ford's extended return to his thirties comes a few months after Disney, which produced the movie alongside LucasFilm, announced it had built an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-ai-actor-younger-older-reaging-154509639.html">AI that could make an actor appear older or younger</a> with relative ease at the end of last year. The researchers behind the AI, known as FRAN (face re-aging network), explained it would only work with real people if there were images available of the person in those poses and lighting at a younger age.</p><p>Footage of Ford's earlier roles was pulled from the Lucasfilm archives to accomplish this. Ford also acted with dots across his face to aid the system — and with the agility of a young man, according to Mangold. Then, the technology would quickly do its thing. Mangold would &quot;shoot Harrison on a Monday as, you know, a 79-year-old playing a 35-year-old, and I could see dailies by Wednesday with his head already replaced.&quot;&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/indiana-jones-5-will-feature-a-de-aged-harrison-ford-for-the-first-25-minutes-103553183.html?src=rss

<p>Tile, best known for its AirTag-like trackers that help you locate lost objects, can now find something that can get lost on purpose — your cat. The $40 <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tile-unleashes-tile-for-cats-to-give-cat-owners-peace-of-mind-301806178.html">Tile for Cats</a> tracker from Life360 is a modified version of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-08-new-tile-sticker-2019.html">Tile Sticker</a> with a silicon collar attachment and 250 foot Bluetooth range. The idea is to give you peace of mind that your cat is somewhere in the house, and then help you figure out exactly where that sneaky floof is hiding.&nbsp;</p><p>The battery on the Tile for Cats lasts a generous three years, and you can easily replace the sticker. It even offers AI assistant integration with Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant, so you can locate Sir Fluffybutt with a voice command.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For the $40 price tag, you get a Tile sticker and attachment that's compatible with most cat collars, including breakaway collars. The attachment can stretch up to 1.7 times without breaking and is water resistant, so it'll continue to function even if hit with a few drops.&nbsp;</p><p>Tile for Cats is Life360's first pet tracker, though the company was already <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9a27b27f-6486-47c7-9cdc-0c4040bd9690&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Tile&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5YTI3YjI3Zi02NDg2LTQ3YzctOWNkYy0wYzQwNDBiZDk2OTAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGlsZS5jb20vZW4tY2EvYmxvZy9wZXQtdHJhY2tlciIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOWFkYzJjNmItMzAwZi00ZGIwLWI1MDctMzIyNzkyOWRlNWZhIn0&amp;signature=AQAAASAqwJ9FZUOPuy76_jy7XOcoERL_YQ9oqV7t5Xc32i91&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tile.com%2Fen-ca%2Fblog%2Fpet-tracker">marketing its regular Tile Trackers</a> for the same purpose.

## Beats Studio Buds+ leak on Amazon with a May 18th release date

<p>Beats might release its next-gen <a href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-studio-buds-review-150014566.html">Studio Buds</a> model on May 18th. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/25/beats-studio-buds-plus-amazon-listing/"><em>MacRumors</em></a> spotted an <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:FUna0DBDoAYJ:https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Studio-Buds-Compatibility-Built/dp/B0BZK2Z2TC&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk">Amazon listing</a> that showed images and details for Apple's Beats Studio Buds+ — the page even allowed customers to pre-order the earbuds until it was yanked offline. The earbuds, which were listed for $170 or $20 more than the current model, will have a transparent option that puts their internal components on display, similar to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nothing-ear-1-impressions-release-date-price-130026767.html">Nothing's design</a>. That said, they will also be available in black and ivory for those who aren't quite as intrigued or enamored by transparent electronics.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the listing, the Studio Buds+ can run up to 36 hours, instead of just 24 when combined with the charging case like the current model. Speaking of the charging case, it seems to retain its predecessor's shape, except it's most likely lighter. The upcoming product's item weight is 3.87 ounces, while the current Studio Buds' is listed as ‎4.5 ounces.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Studio Buds+ microphones are three times larger than the current model's, and they also have a more powerful processor. Those components enable 1.6 more active noise cancelling power and a transparency mode — that is, the mode that lets some ambient noise in so the user remains aware of their surroundings — that's apparently twice as effective.&nbsp;</p><p>The upcoming earbuds also support spatial audio for immersive sounds, &quot;always on&quot; Siri and compatibility with Apple's &quot;Find My&quot; tracking app. Plus, they feature one-touch pairing with both Apple and Android devices, as well as automatic switching that makes it easy to use them with multiple phones and tablets. Considering the Amazon page for the Studio Buds+ seems to have the complete details about the model, we'll likely see it go back up in the coming weeks when Apple is ready to take pre-orders.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/beats-studio-buds-leak-on-amazon-with-a-may-18th-release-date-091639570.html?src=rss

## TikTok may have generative AI avatars soon

<p>TikTok may soon let you create AI stylized avatars not unlike what you can with deep learning apps like Midjourney or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/engadget-podcast-lensa-ai-avatar-images-chatgpt-133057497.html">Lensa</a>, according to a Twitter thread from social media guru <a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1651012552376156166">Matt Navarra</a> seen by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/25/23698394/tiktok-ai-profile-picture-avatar-lensa"><em>The Verge</em></a>. Called AI Avatars, the tool lets you upload three to 10 photos of yourself and choose from five art styles. It will then generate up to 30 separate avatars in a couple of minutes. You can then download one, several or all of the images to use as a profile picture or in stories.</p><p>Though the styles are more limited than what you can get on Lensa, the results look pretty good — so the feature is bound to be popular. Likely for that reason, TikTok will only let you use it once a day to presumably avoid overloading servers.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="TikTok may have generative AI avatars soon" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/7515d4c0-e3ee-11ed-bb38-1718436cfcd0" style="height: 1772px; width: 2500px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Matt Navara</div></figure><p>Though generative AI images seem like harmless fun, they're not without some controversy. For both Lensa and Midjourney, artists have complained that the AI has sampled their work and borrowed from it a bit too liberally at times. And earlier this year, Getty <a href="https://www.engadget.com/getty-images-sues-the-maker-of-ai-art-generator-stable-diffusion-over-data-scraping-allegations-184502897.html">launched a lawsuit</a> against Stable Diffusion claiming it was scraping its data to generate art.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-may-have-generative-ai-avatars-soon-065038031.html?src=rss

## Tinder adds video selfies to photo verification

<p>Tinder is <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2023-04-26-Tinder-Adds-Video-Selfie-to-Photo-Verification">bolstering</a> its photo verification system by letting members take video selfies to better prove who they are. The feature will actually be required for Photo Verification to earn Tinder's official blue checkmark. The site will also double-check your video selfie against profile photos. The aim is to guard against dating scammers, as a video is a lot harder to fake than a photo.&nbsp;</p><p>To perform this verification, you just need to record video of yourself in the app using your smartphone’s front camera — again, something that would be quite difficult to cheat. Another dating site, Hinge, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hinge-video-selfie-verification-announced-202522227.html">implemented</a> a similar video verification system last year to combat scam accounts and catfishing.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Performing the video selfie procedure also earns you status into Tinder's new &quot;Photo Verified Cuties&quot; club. That lets you choose to only see other photo verified member recommendations via their Message Settings. You can also ask a match to verify before they're allowed to send a message. If you currently have the verification check mark, Tinder will soon ask you to re-verify with a video selfie “in the coming months,” the company wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>The feature could help a lot of users avoid scams if they use it correctly — and photo verification is free, unlike the Tinder Gold subscription service. However, the dating site still isn't forcing members to use photo verification, so you'll still want to stay on guard.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/tinder-adds-video-selfies-to-photo-verification-062835070.html?src=rss

<p>We might see an electric vehicle based on Honda's e:Architecture, its dedicated EV platform, a year earlier than the company had previously announced. At a business briefing, wherein the automaker talked about earnings structure, battery initiatives and other things, it has announced that it's <a href="https://global.honda/newsroom/news/2023/c230426eng.html?from=newsroom_headline_area">building a mid-to-large-size EV</a> based on the e:Architecture and that will go on sale in North America by 2025. Honda <a href="https://hondanews.com/en-US/releases/summary-of-honda-briefing-on-automobile-electrification-business">previously said</a> that vehicles adopting the architecture will be available in 2026.&nbsp;</p><p>The company also announced that it's further developing its vehicle OS for use with mid-to-large-size EVs in North America and making sure that it allows for the &quot;continuous advancement of vehicle functions and services for customers even after the vehicle is purchased.&quot; As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/25/honda-says-first-earchitecture-based-ev-is-coming-sooner-than-planned/?tpcc=tcplustwitter"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> notes, though, it didn't say if it's currently working on (or at least planning) a smaller vehicle based on its e:Architecture for the North American market at the moment.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Before the vehicles based on its dedicated platform come out, Honda will launch the EVs it's currently developing with General Motors: The Acura ZDX and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/honda-prologue-electric-suv-184544002.html">the Prologue</a>, which is automaker's first electric SUV. Both vehicles will be available in 2024. In Japan, Honda is expected to release a series of small-size EVs, including an electric N-One, which is a mini box-like Kei car that can be commonly seen on the streets in the country, in 2024. It will also launch a small-size SUV for the Japanese market in 2026.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/honda-will-debut-a-mid-to-large-size-ev-based-on-its-earchitecture-in-2025-051042586.html?src=rss
