The future looks deader than ever after Evil Dead Rise's successful opening weekend. Director Lee Cronin stopped by IGN to explain how a key scene from 1992's Army of Darkness not only served as inspiration for how Rise could stand on its own, but for how to explain future spinoffs in the series. Plus, Cronin teases his conversations with Evil Dead creator Sam Raimi, which point to the potential of a team-up film between Ash Williams, the 2013 reboot's Mia, and the surviving characters of Evil Dead Rise.

Take another look at Disney's The Little Mermaid in this latest teaser for the upcoming live-action movie. This reimagining of the studio’s animated musical classic stars Halle Bailey as Ariel, Daveed Diggs as the voice of Sebastian, Jacob Tremblay as the voice of Flounder, Awkwafina as the voice of Scuttle, Jonah Hauer-King as Prince Eric, Art Malik as Sir Grimsby, Noma Dumezweni as Queen Selina, Javier Bardem as King Triton, and Melissa McCarthy as Ursula.

While mermaids are forbidden to interact with humans, Ariel must follow her heart. She makes a deal with the evil sea witch, Ursula, which gives her a chance to experience life on land, but ultimately places her life – and her father’s crown – in jeopardy. 

The Little Mermaid is directed by Rob Marshall with a screenplay by David Magee. The songs feature music from Alan Menken and lyrics by Howard Ashman, and new lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda. The film is produced by Marc Platt, p.g.a., Miranda, John DeLuca, p.g.a., and Rob Marshall, p.g.a., with Jeffrey Silver serving as executive producer.

Star Wars Jedi: Survivor reviewed by Dan Stapleton on PlayStation 5. Also available on Xbox Series X|S and PC.

"Star Wars Jedi: Survivor takes what Fallen Order did and wall-runs with it, then double-jumps and air-dashes straight into an epic lightsaber battle. Rather than taking us back to square one to begin Cal’s journey as a Padawan again, we’re trusted with control of a full-fledged Jedi Knight who we can grow into a master of superhuman mobility and fantastic and challenging combat. With a new set of larger, more diverse, and densely packed worlds to explore and a memorable cast of returning characters, Survivor tells a story that may be predictable at times but is still fun and emotional to watch play out. Launch performance issues aside, it’s a sequel that does virtually everything better than the original – which was already an exceptional Star Wars game. If Respawn makes one more like this it’ll be the best Star Wars trilogy in 30 years, hands down."

Watch our Alien Isolation Art of the Level video on Alien Day 2023! Few video games capture the essence of their inspiration quite like Alien: Isolation. But it’s the ground-breaking use of the xenomorph that makes the 2014 survival horror game such a triumph; this perfect organism is an engine for fear. 

The game's fifth mission, The Quarantine, marks the Alien Isolation xenomorph first encounter, in which it actively hunts you through Sevastopol Station. To find out how it was made, we spoke to level designer Catherine Woolley and lead artist Jude Bond about how Creative Assembly brought together astonishing Alien Isolation AI, clever looping Alien Isolation level design, and cutting edge lighting to inject pure terror into your first Alien Isolation alien encounter.
