Today, developer Snowman, the studio behind the <em>Alto</em> series, properly unveiled its next release: <em>Laya\u2019s Horizon</em>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/9/23631085/layas-horizon-teaser-trailer-snowman-netflix\">which was first teased last month</a>. The debut trailer shows off a beautiful world where players soar through forests, mountains, and towns utilizing something like wingsuit flying. It seems like a natural evolution of the <em>Alto</em> games, switching the 2D snow (and sand) boarding gameplay for three-dimensional flying.</p>\n<p id=\"ADPsBr\"><em>Laya\u2019s Horizon</em> is also notable as it\u2019s coming to Netflix, where it will be free to subscribers on both iOS and Android.
