Drawing on 20 years of on-the-ground reporting and revealing new interviews with both U.S. and Taliban officials, award-winning producers Marcela Gaviria and Martin Smith chronicle how what began in the wake of the 9/11 attacks as an effort to eliminate Al Qaeda and oust its ruling ally, the Taliban, became America’s longest war with nearly 50,000 Afghan civilians dead, approximately 2,400 American servicemembers killed — and how it ended in defeat in August 2021 with U.S. troops withdrawing, the Western-backed Afghan government collapsing, and the Taliban once again in control.

Part Three of “America and the Taliban” investigates how negotiations between the Trump administration and the Taliban unfolded, how the Taliban seized territory in Afghanistan and how it eventually took control of the Afghan capital of Kabul. The series conclusion also examines the legacy and toll of America’s longest war, and what the U.S. left behind when it withdrew — from hundreds of Afghans trying to board planes to safety, to women and girls facing restrictions and repression under Taliban rule.
