With reception getting colder and colder with each passing show, there was some hope that the third season of their hit show would turn the tides a little. It\u2026 does not seem to have done that.\n\nThe Mandalorian Season 3 definitely raises some questions. Like why do these Star Wars shows keep making their main characters into side characters? Why do bad guys keep \u201csomehow returning\u201d? Are we ever going to see Mando\u2019s face again, or is Pedro Pascal just over all of this? Why does the plot meander for so long and then suddenly pick up steam in the last two episodes? Is this show over now?\n\nTo answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to The Mandalorian Season 3!\n\nCheck Out These Other Videos:\n\nThe Mandalorian Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cQeT-vLiwE\n\nThe Book of Boba Fett Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fbBhcK0CDg\n\nOur Social Media:\nhttps://twitter.com/screenrant\nhttps://www.facebook.com/PitchMeeting\n\nOur Website\nhttp://screenrant.com/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAtDj7WLjDY", "date_published": "2023-04-27 19:01:17+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
