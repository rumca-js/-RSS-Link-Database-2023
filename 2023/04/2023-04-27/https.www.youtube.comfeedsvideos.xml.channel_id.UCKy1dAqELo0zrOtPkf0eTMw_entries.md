Priyanka Chopra Jonas gets the drop on her target in this exclusive scene from the Russos-produced espionage series Citadel.

Eight years ago, Citadel fell. The independent global spy agency—tasked to uphold the safety and security of all people—was destroyed by operatives of Manticore, a powerful syndicate manipulating the world from the shadows. With Citadel’s fall, elite agents Mason Kane (Richard Madden) and Nadia Sinh (Priyanka Chopra Jonas) had their memories wiped as they narrowly escaped with their lives. They’ve remained hidden ever since, building new lives under new identities, unaware of their pasts. Until one night, when Mason is tracked down by his former Citadel colleague, Bernard Orlick (Stanley Tucci), who desperately needs his help to prevent Manticore from establishing a new world order. Mason seeks out his former partner, Nadia, and the two spies embark on a mission that takes them around the world in an effort to stop Manticore, all while contending with a relationship built on secrets, lies, and a dangerous-yet-undying love.

The first season of Citadel consists of six episodes with two episodes premiering April 28 on Prime Video, and one episode rolling out weekly through May 26. The landmark, high-stakes drama is executive produced by the Russo Brothers’ AGBO and showrunner David Weil, and stars Richard Madden and Priyanka Chopra Jonas, with Stanley Tucci and Lesley Manville. Citadel will be available in more than 240 countries and territories worldwide.

From Amazon Studios and the Russo Brothers’ AGBO, Citadel is executive produced by Anthony Russo, Joe Russo, Mike Larocca, Angela Russo-Otstot, and Scott Nemes for AGBO, with David Weil serving as showrunner and executive producer. Josh Appelbaum, André Nemec, Jeff Pinkner, and Scott Rosenberg serve as executive producers for Midnight Radio. Newton Thomas Sigel and Patrick Moran also serve as executive producers.

Age of Wonders 4 reviewed by Leana Hafer on PC.

The fact that your legacy follows you in Age of Wonders 4 is rewarding, and the faster pace of its very strong campaign mechanics and pretty good tactical battles make it feel like you can write a new chapter of this saga in a reasonable amount of time. Cranking all the dials up to maximum weirdness can lead to some edge cases that ruin the fun a bit, but it's not that big of a price to pay for the vast map and empire customization we get to play with.

With the highly anticipated movie hitting theaters June 16th, the trailer opens up with Micheal Keaton’s Batman describing what it was like to lose his parents, and the similar pain of losing a loved one Ezra Miller’s Barry Allen has gone through with the loss of his mother. The only difference is no matter how much crime fighting Bruce Wayne does, his actions cannot bring back his parents. #TheFlashMovie has a lot of hype around it, and many might be asking if there’s potential for #TheFlash to return in a sequel in the #DCU. A fan-favorite animated series is returning to Cartoon Network, Beetlejuice is making a comeback, and more on today’s fix of entertainment news with Akeem Lawanson.

Directed by Academy Award winner Taika Waititi (Jojo Rabbit, Thor: Ragnarok), Next Goal Wins follows the American Samoa soccer team, infamous for their brutal 31-0 FIFA loss in 2001. With the World Cup Qualifiers approaching, the team hires down-on-his-luck, maverick coach Thomas Rongen (Michael Fassbender) hoping he will turn the world's worst soccer team around in this heartfelt underdog comedy.
