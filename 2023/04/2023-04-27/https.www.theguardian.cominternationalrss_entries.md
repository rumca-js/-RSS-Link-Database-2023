<p>Our food critic uses his years of experience dining out to advise you on how to pick the best place to eat</p><p>All unfamiliar restaurants are terrible until proven otherwise. I’m not proud of this blunt statement. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jan/01/review-of-the-year-i-was-privileged-to-eat-stupidly-well-in-2022-" title="">I have written about restaurants for so long because I love them</a>, often in that heated adult way. Yes, there are the occasional skewerings, of the grossly overpriced and the grimly underperforming. But generally, I regard myself as a cheerleader. I want good places to prosper.</p><p>First, though, I have to identify them, and eating out is rarely a cheap gamble. Which means it’s not something anyone can treat casually. For me, it’s often relatively straightforward. I recognise the name of a chef or a restaurateur. I like what they’ve done before and can be reasonably confident about what they’re doing now. But sometimes, like everyone else, I have to take a punt. Perhaps I am visiting a town I don’t know well. Perhaps the new place is run by a team I’ve never come across before.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/apr/27/start-with-the-font-jay-rayners-guide-to-choosing-a-good-restaurant-anywhere">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An expansive new exhibition, on the 100th anniversary of his birthday, sees notable names from Cindy Crawford to Spike Lee pick their favorite images</p><p>“People who you’ve read about or know about – there they are looking right at you.” Art curator Kara Vander Weg is talking with me about global art gallery Gagosian’s major new Richard Avedon retrospective, where 150 individuals – ranging from the younger Barbara Bush to Khloe Kardashian to Spike Lee to Elton John to Renata Adler to Vander Weg herself – each selected a single Avedon photo to celebrate. She’s explaining the intimacy that she believes sets Avedon’s photos apart. “His subjects are looking right at you, and you can look right at them. You can’t help but react to the human right there in front of you.”</p><p>Avedon was monumental for the size of his photos, which tended to be printed in life-size or larger, leading to the effect that Vanger Weg described, where viewers can look right at his subjects and have an encounter that feels extremely intimate. “It’s a really interesting relationship between art and the viewer,” she told me. “Avedon must have known. He would work for months and months with models trying to find the right sizes of images. He must of known that humans in the room would relate to the images in a really special way. That’s what it is about these photographs, you’re looking in the eyes of another person. You can’t help but connect.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/27/richard-avedon-photos-ny-exhibit">Continue reading...</a>

It tapped a succession of hip names as collaborators – house producers Midland and Morgan Geist and Metronomy’s Joseph Mount among them – and it eschewed the obvious reference points, operating instead under the influence of Italo disco, baroque soul producer Charles Stepney and the kind of chugging 110bpm sound that the late Andrew Weatherall favoured at his A Love from Outer Space nights.</p><p>Confident and self-assured, it didn’t sound like a last roll of the dice from an artist at the end of their tether, although that’s precisely what it was. Disheartened by the lukewarm reception afforded her 2017 album, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/19/jessie-ware-glasshouse-review-smooth-soul-ramped-up-when-the-diva-lets-loose">Glasshouse</a> – a lunge for the middle-of-the-road involving a closing track co-authored by Ed Sheeran – and tired, <a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/interview/jessie-ware-that-feels-good/">as she recently put it</a>, of being made “to feel like I needed to be the next Adele”, Ware fired her management and considered quitting music entirely to focus on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/nov/13/lennie-and-jessie-wares-recipe-for-podcast-success">her hugely popular podcast Table Manners</a>.

<p>The Trump presidency was fuelled by the Fox hosts’ fact-free claims. Their gospel of hate will endure</p><p>At an 18 February 2017 rally, Donald Trump railed against immigrants and violence. He was unusually focused on Sweden, warning the crowd about recent terrorist attacks in the country: “You look at what’s happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this?” If a terrorist attack in Sweden seemed unbelievable, it’s because it was. There had been no attack by immigrants the night before Trump spoke. The most recent attacks on Sweden, at the time, were a series of bombings between November 2016 and January 2017 that were allegedly connected to the neo-Nazi group the Nordic Resistance.</p><p>People in Sweden shared photographs of their very un-bombed houses. Reporters did their due diligence and wrote stories about how nothing at all had happened in Sweden the previous night. It was a news cycle of nothing. But all that nothing could not persuade the president he was wrong. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/03/06/i-proved-to-be-right-trump-again-refers-to-an-imaginary-attack-in-sweden/">Trump repeated</a> the story over and over. He was right, he insisted in multiple interviews: Sweden had been bombed by immigrant terrorists and he knew because he’d seen it on Tucker Carlson Tonight.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/apr/26/donald-trump-tucker-carlson-relationship">Continue reading...</a>
