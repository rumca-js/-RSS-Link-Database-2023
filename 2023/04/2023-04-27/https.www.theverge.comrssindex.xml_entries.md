<p id="cIwk5o">I could do some explanation of it being a portmanteau of “sky” + “posting” but I think we just hit the sicko event horizon and a bunch of shitposters logged on over the last 24 hours, including a bunch who didn’t bother with Mastodon. Anyway it’s skeeting now. Sorry if you don’t like it. Skeet, skeet, motherfucker.</p>

But it’s also going to let players who are blind or have low vision race around tracks by listening for beeps and boops.

<p id="K3zYJA">Turn 10 Studios has teamed up with accessibility consultant and blind gamer Brandon Cole to tune these audio cues and make racing blind in <em>Forza Motorsport</em> a reality.

In <a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/company/a-message-from-drew">a memo to employees</a>, Dropbox CEO Drew Houston attributes the layoffs to a rocky economy — but also says that the cuts will allow the company to build out its AI division.</p>

And we’ve done that wherever possible,” Houston writes. “However, our next stage of growth requires a different mix of skill sets, particularly in AI and early-stage product development. We’ve been bringing in great talent in these areas over the last couple years and we’ll need even more.”</p>

  <p id="mNxkqK">Lawyers for automaker Tesla have argued that statements by Elon Musk about the capabilities of the company’s Autopilot software can’t be trusted as they could be deepfakes, according to reports from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/elon-or-deepfake-musk-must-face-questions-autopilot-statements-2023-04-26"><em>Reuters</em></a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-27/musk-likely-must-give-deposition-in-fatal-autopilot-crash-suit"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>. </p>
<p id="8V5ZkM">Tesla presented this argument as part of its justification as to why Musk shouldn’t be interviewed under oath for a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525330/tesla-autopilot-lawsuit-model-x-crash-walter-huang">lawsuit blaming the company</a> for the death of Apple engineer Walter Huang in a fatal crash in 2018. </p>
<p id="qs6cNB">Huang died while driving a Tesla Model X, with attorneys for his family arguing Tesla’s driver assist software was at fault.

  <p id="CSXtWN">Samsung’s memory chip business <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-announces-first-quarter-2023-results">just had a terrible quarter</a>, as falling demand and high inventories contributed to a 4.58 trillion won (around $3.4 billion) loss from the division, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-26/samsung-s-chip-arm-posts-loss-as-memory-slump-nears-nadir?sref=ExbtjcSG"><em>Bloomberg </em>reports</a>. The loss at the unit, which <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/27/samsung-earnings-q1-2023.html"><em>CNBC</em> reports</a> is typically its largest profit driver, contributed to Samsung’s quarterly operating profit plunging 95 percent in the quarter to 640 billion won (roughly $478 million).</p>
<p id="7uX4ho">A few different factors contributed to Samsung’s losses at its memory chip division. Smartphone and PC makers stockpiled chips during the pandemic as a hedge against supply issues as demand boomed, but have since been left with large inventory excesses as consumer demand has dropped off amidst high inflation and broader global economic...</p>

<p id="InPdHH">Guess again. The <em>higher-end</em> Asus ROG Ally will apparently cost just $699.99.

  <p id="pKrqWe">LG’s Gram line of laptops have always been designed to be lightweight and thin, and now the company has released <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lg-usa-announces-slimmest-lg-gram-laptop-ever-301807959.html">a new “SuperSlim” model</a> that’s a strong competitor to the likes of Apple’s MacBook Air in the portability department (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-launches-a-new-superslim-gram-laptop-with-a-15-inch-oled-display-170407209.html">via <em>Engadget</em></a>).</p>
<p id="1Ov7zi">LG officially calls its new laptop the Gram SuperSlim (formerly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/3/23536362/lg-gram-ultraslim-style-laptop-17-16-haptic-touchpad-features-ces">the Ultraslim</a>), which the company touts in its <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lg-usa-announces-slimmest-lg-gram-laptop-ever-301807959.html">press release</a> as the “thinnest LG Gram ever.” It measures just 0.43 inches thick — thinner than the M2 MacBook Air — and has a 15.6-inch OLED display compared to Apple’s 13.6-inch IPS one. Oh, and LG’s is also lighter at just 2.2 pounds, compared to the MacBook Air at 2.7 pounds.</p>
