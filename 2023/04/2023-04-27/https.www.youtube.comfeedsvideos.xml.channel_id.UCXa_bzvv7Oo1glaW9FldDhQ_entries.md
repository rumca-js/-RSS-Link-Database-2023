Like I mentioned at the beginning of this feature, these factors come together to make Strayed Lights a bland experience. And that’s one of the worst places to be for any entertainment product. It doesn’t do anything exceptionally well, and it doesn’t do anything exceptionally bad either. It’s a mediocre product that fails to do anything to keep you interested in what it has to say. 

The parry based combat is interesting in concept, but falters in the face of repetitive enemy encounters and mostly lackluster bosses. The minimalist approach to the narrative feels like the game is trying too hard to follow in the footsteps of the likes of Journey - but fails to capture the magic of what makes those stories interesting in the first place. All in all, it’s pretty hard to recommend this game to anyone - which is all the more saddening because it could have been something special had it spent some more time in the oven.
