It's not just about scale (though that certainly helps), but also the circumstances leading up to it that give them weight. So whether it's a single person annihilating hordes of enemies and shifting the tides of war, or a desperate battle for survival, let's look at 15 of the most epic large-scale battles of all time.

And that\u2019s one of the worst places to be for any entertainment product. It doesn\u2019t do anything exceptionally well, and it doesn\u2019t do anything exceptionally bad either. It\u2019s a mediocre product that fails to do anything to keep you interested in what it has to say. \n\nThe parry based combat is interesting in concept, but falters in the face of repetitive enemy encounters and mostly lackluster bosses. The minimalist approach to the narrative feels like the game is trying too hard to follow in the footsteps of the likes of Journey - but fails to capture the magic of what makes those stories interesting in the first place. All in all, it\u2019s pretty hard to recommend this game to anyone - which is all the more saddening because it could have been something special had it spent some more time in the oven.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgoSvkDl4pg", "date_published": "2023-04-27 12:00:35+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
