Since the first season of The Mandalorian in 2019 was well-received by critics and audiences alike, Disney has been going all-in on their streaming series set in the Star Wars universe. With reception getting colder and colder with each passing show, there was some hope that the third season of their hit show would turn the tides a little. It… does not seem to have done that.

The Mandalorian Season 3 definitely raises some questions. Like why do these Star Wars shows keep making their main characters into side characters? Why do bad guys keep “somehow returning”? Are we ever going to see Mando’s face again, or is Pedro Pascal just over all of this? Why does the plot meander for so long and then suddenly pick up steam in the last two episodes? Is this show over now?

To answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to The Mandalorian Season 3!
