Carbon capture technology, if done wrong could make climate change worse. New carbon capture trains are a brilliant idea, using caught CO2 to frack for more oil, NOT A BRILLIANT IDEA. In this video we explain why the insane engineering of carbon capture could be a really bad thing!

While people are talking about James Corden, Adele, hockey, the Leafs, we are thinking about Carbon Capture. The science, the engineering and the physics of how it all works.
