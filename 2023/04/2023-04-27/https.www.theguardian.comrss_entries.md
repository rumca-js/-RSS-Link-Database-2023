<p>Seven Ukrainians killed between Wednesday and Thursday; EU votes that Russian deportation of children is genocide</p><p>The parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe has voted that the <strong>forced detention and deportation of children from Russian occupied territories of Ukraine is genocide</strong>.</p><p><strong>At least seven civilians were killed and 33 injured between Wednesday and Thursday, Ukraine’s presidential office said,</strong> including one person killed and 23 wounded when four Kalibr cruise missiles hit the southern city of Mykolaiv.</p><p><strong>Russia said its patience should not be tested over nuclear weapons in another repeat of hardline rhetoric.</strong> Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said that Russia will do “everything to prevent the development of events according to the worst scenario … but not at the cost of infringing on our vital interests”.</p><p><strong>The Biden administration is sanctioning Russia’s Federal Security Service for wrongfully detaining Americans.</strong> The sanctions are largely symbolic, since the organisation is already under sweeping existing sanctions for the invasion of Ukraine.</p><p><strong>Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia welcomed anything that could hasten the end of the Ukraine conflict</strong> when asked about Wednesday’s phone call between the Chinese and Ukrainian leaders. But Russia still needed to achieve the aims of its “special military operation” in Ukraine.</p><p><strong>The Kremlin said relations with European countries were at their “lowest possible level”</strong> amid more expulsions of diplomats.</p><p><strong>Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, welcomed the discussion between China’s President Xi and Ukraine’s President Zelenskiy</strong> and repeated the possibility of the war ending at the “negotiating table”.</p><p><strong>Stoltenberg said 98% of promised combat vehicles had been delivered to Ukraine,</strong> comprising 1,550 armoured vehicles and 230 tanks. This equates to nine new Ukrainian brigades.</p><p><strong>Russia’s defence ministry claimed its forces had taken four blocks in north-western, western and south-western Bakhmut</strong>, Russia state-owned news agency RIA reported.</p><p><strong>The head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group said on Thursday he had been joking when he said his men would suspend artillery fire in Bakhmut</strong> to allow Ukrainian forces on the other side of the frontline to show the city to visiting US journalists.</p><p><strong>Putin has ordered the Russian government to create museums dedicated to Moscow’s offensive in Ukraine,</strong> according to instructions published on the Kremlin website.</p><p><strong>A Moscow court on Thursday ordered the dissolution of a prominent research centre specialising in racism and xenophobia in Russia,</strong> in the latest move against critical voices since the start of the Ukraine conflict.</p><p><strong>Russia’s foreign ministry has rejected a bid by the US embassy to visit the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich in prison</strong> on 11 May. It said the measure was taken in response to Washington’s failure to process visas for “representatives from the journalistic pool” of the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, during his visit to the United Nations on Monday.</p><p><strong>The Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, has invited Pope Francis to visit Ukraine.</strong> During a visit to the Vatican, he asked the pontiff for help to return children from the east of Ukraine who have been forcibly taken to Russia by Kremlin forces.</p><p><strong>Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Thursday that the Black Sea grain deal could only be saved by fully implementing it</strong> and that it was not “a buffet you can pick and choose from”. Moscow says parts of the deal meant to allow it to export its own agricultural goods are not being honoured.</p><p><strong>Andrij Melnyk, Ukraine’s former ambassador to Berlin, has said Germany is still failing to provide the support it should.</strong> “The Germans are helping much more than they were, and for that we Ukrainians are very grateful, but the government is only delivering as much as it feels it should,” he told Die Zeit.</p><p><strong>Russia has reinforced its defences ahead of a much-expected counterattack by Ukrainian forces, analysts have suggested</strong>. Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports that the 500 miles (800km) of Russian lines protecting occupied Ukraine have been triple-fortified and received a “gush of manpower”. The timing comes as the usual winter freeze has begun to thaw and dry, making mobilisation more likely.</p><p><strong>Britain’s opposition Labour party has asked the government why there has been no new weapons announcement since February</strong> and no fresh update from ministers to parliament since January.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/28/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-429-of-the-invasion">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As landlords charge up to 66% price increases, young people are being left with no home. This emotive documentary follows the victims of the UK’s broken rental market</p><p>In some ways, you don’t need to know anything more about the current state of the rental property market than the fact that “no fault” evictions exist, whereby a private landlord can boot out a tenant without reason under section 21 of the Housing Act 1988. They can do it within the strict terms of the law or, if untroubled by conscience (but who can imagine a landlord in such a state?), issue them in the hope of unsettling the tenant so much that they leave without checking their rights and/or thinking it’s worth the fight. But even without one being issued, the mere fact that they exist clouds a renter’s peace of mind. It is a prime marker of how weighted in one party’s favour our law – and our culture – is over the other.</p><p>So to BBC Three’s four-part series Evicted, following a number of twentysomething workers in various cities after they, through no fault of their own – it’s right there in the name! – are served eviction notices and have two months to find alternative accommodation. They represent different slices of generation rent but what they all have in common is that they are employed, paying their rent on time, have little chance of avoiding losing their current home and virtually no hope of ever owning their own place.</p><p>Evicted aired on BBC Three and is available on BBC iPlayer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/27/evicted-review-no-room-is-worth-the-extortionate-rent-these-young-people-are-being-charged">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Jerry Springer, the captivating TV host famed for his eponymous and provocative talkshow The Jerry Springer Show, has died aged 79. Springer's show entertained but also scandalised audiences with its notorious on-air fights, swearing and infidelity revelations. After almost three decades hosting The Jerry Springer Show, he hosted America's Got Talent and Judge Jerry, a spinoff of the popular Judge Judy show. Jene Galvin, a friend of Springer's and spokesperson for the family, said he was 'irreplaceable'. 'Jerry's ability to connect with people was at the heart of his success in everything he tried whether that was politics, broadcasting or just joking with people on the street,' Galvin said.</p><p></p><p>Born in London in 1944, Springer's multifaceted career included a period as an advisor to Robert F Kennedy and a brief tenure as the mayor of Cincinnati</p><p></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/27/jerry-springer-talkshow-host-dies-79">Jerry Springer, influential US talkshow host, dies aged 79</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/27/jerry-springer-show-tv-episodes-moments">Jerry Springer Show: his most outrageous TV moments</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/27/jerry-springer-tv-legacy">Jerry Springer: the man who changed US television for better and worse</a></p></li></ul> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2023/apr/27/jerry-springer-video-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When at last the final whistle went and 70,000 people erupted, Barcelona’s anthem booming round the Camp Nou at last taking the tension away, their players collapsed to the floor exhausted. Chelsea’s gathered in a circle in the middle of the pitch; they had this team to edge, competing to the last, but it is the Catalans who made it through, a 1-1 draw on the night taking them to a third consecutive Champions League final, their fourth in five seasons.</p><p>On the touchline, Emma Hayes could be proud of her team, who came from one down here, Guro Reiten equalising Caroline Graham Hansen’s opener, but the Norwegian’s first leg goal at Stamford Bridge had ultimately decided this. Having defeated Lyon another extraordinary feat was a step too far; Chelsea eventually beaten by a very special team. In the end, there was just not quite enough. They had though got close.

<p>The man synonymous with hand-to-mouth television was also a progressive political mind and groundbreaking changemaker</p><p>I’ll never forget the time I went to a taping of The Jerry Springer Show with two of my closest high school pals. This was back in the 1990s, when Chicago was the center of the talkshow universe and Springer and Oprah were the hottest tickets in town. My parents, bless, wouldn’t have batted an eye if I said I was going to see the queen of daytime. But the king of sleaze? Up to now they wonder how I ever got their permission.</p><p>Somewhere in my childhood bedroom, the ticket is sitting in a drawer with the actual episode title – not that the show headings stopped TV Guide from calling it “the worst show in the history of television”. Despite producers’ yeoman efforts to class up the spectacle for censors, it was the same show every day: somebody cheated, somebody didn’t know and we’re all about to find out. This one was no different – and still some of the most fun I’ve ever had.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/27/jerry-springer-tv-legacy">Continue reading...</a>

I remember overwhelming feelings of guilt, and a loss of agency.

The rapid event frequency, high stakes and addictive roulette content were the factors that brought on a form of psychological dependence. My suicidal ideation came not because of the amount of money I had lost, but because I didn’t have access to any more money to gamble with.

According to the <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/statistics-and-research/publication/gambling-behaviour-in-2022-findings-from-the-quarterly-telephone-survey" title="">Gambling Commission</a>, 44% of Britons today aged over 16 are gamblers of some kind, with 27% taking part in online gambling. That’s about 30 million gamblers, with the numbers concentrated in the under-50s. The truth is that we are not a nation of shopkeepers but a nation of punters.</p><p>The law was last redrawn in Labour’s 2005 Gambling Act. Its underlying intention, extraordinary though it now seems, was to promote legal but regulated gambling. Though this was itself dubious, and although the bill was improved during its passage through parliament, it reckoned altogether without two important things. The first was that many people’s real disposable income would contract, not increase, over the years, making easier gambling a significant factor in any cost of living crisis. The second was that online gambling was about to mushroom into the main form of recreational gambling.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/27/the-guardian-view-on-gambling-reform-fighting-the-british-disease">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Vladimir Putin’s revanchist ambition to reconstitute ‘Holy Rus’ by force has destroyed ancient ties and religious bonds</p><p>Speaking last month at the beginning of Lent, Patriarch Kirill, the primate of the Russian Orthodox church, <a href="https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2023/10-march/news/world/patriarch-kirill-russians-do-battle-with-evil-in-high-places" title="">sermonised</a> on the subject of Russia’s frontline role in fighting for “God’s truth”. The church, he emphasised, must play its part in the battle against the secularising forces of the liberal west in order to preserve “Holy Rus and our people, living by God’s law”.</p><p>Patriarch Kirill has deservedly become a religious <a href="https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2023/10-february/news/world/polish-orthodox-leader-criticises-patriarch-kirill" title="">pariah</a> in the global Orthodox church as a result of his cheerleading for Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine. That support shows no sign of waning, no matter the cost in lives and human misery as Mr Putin’s forces dig in. But recent events indicate that the patriarch’s cherished struggle on behalf of “Holy Rus”, defined as a spiritually unified territory including Ukraine and Belarus, has already been lost.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/27/the-guardian-view-on-orthodox-christianity-in-ukraine-breaking-with-moscow">Continue reading...</a>

Even the Nicolas Pépé era was quite fun, as the club emerged from their Emirates-enforced austerity and decided to splurge gargantuan sums on hopeful, flickering talents, only to find new ways of falling short.</p><p>Re: the branch-wielding Basil Fawlty and red car you mention (yesterday’s Still Want More, full email edition). Can I be one of the many to correct you. It wasn’t a Mini, it was in fact a 1967 Austin 1100 Countryman (estate).

The Austin was a serviceable, if underachieving vehicle that never ever quite reached its potential.

I know the first half didn’t go the way we wanted it to, but we’re not out of this game yet. We still have another half to play, and that’s plenty of time to turn things around. Remember why you’re here, why you love this game. You’re here because you’re warriors, you’re fighters, and you don’t give up when the going gets tough. You’ve trained hard for this moment, you’ve sacrificed so much to get here, and you’re not going to let a little adversity get in your way. So let’s put the first half behind us. Let’s forget about the mistakes we made and focus on what we need to do to win. We need to play smarter, we need to play harder, and we need to play as a team. We need to support each other, communicate, and give it our all on every single play. I believe in each and every one of you. I know that you have what it takes to win this game. So let’s go out there and show them what we’re made of! Let’s come back in the second half with fire in our bellies, and let’s show everyone that we are a force to be reckoned with. Remember, this is our game, our time, and our moment. Let’s seize it, let’s own it, and let’s come out on top! Are you with me?

<p>Girona striker earned redemption after miss at Barcelona to become first to score four against Madrid in La Liga for 75 years</p><p>Redemption is rapid round here. In the darkness of the bench, hidden a little but not enough, Taty Castellanos hung his head. A couple of minutes earlier, the Girona striker had been clean through at the Camp Nou, not just one on one but two on one. This was their moment to beat Barcelona for the first time, his moment, but instead of roll the ball into teammate Viktor Tsygankov or bend it into the net, he sent a shot wide. Withdrawn swiftly after, half an hour before the end, he sat and sobbed and didn’t stop. Some time later, his coach said: he’s still in the dressing room, crying.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/10/barcelona-girona-la-liga-match-report">That was 10 April</a>; this was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/25/gironas-castellanos-scores-four-against-real-madrid-to-aid-barcelonas-title-tilt">25 April</a>. Castellanos couldn’t sleep then and he couldn’t sleep now, still awake at 4am and forced to take a pill, but it was different. Fifteen days later and 101km north, Castellanos was taken off early again. This time he was smiling, leaving to a standing ovation, Estadi Montilivi going as mad as he said his mobile was. What he had done – and this line is no longer the empty cliché it once was – had gone round the world. “Crazy,” he called it. “I never imagined this.” Nor did anyone else. What he had done no one had done in 75 years.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/27/the-historic-cathartic-and-biggest-night-of-taty-castellanos-curious-career-girona-real-madrid">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The German-Austrian actor on why he would never predict winning an Oscar, being happy to play Doctor Who and working with a stunt strudel</p><p><strong>Why do you generally choose not to talk about the characters you</strong><strong> have played? </strong><strong>It seems unusual for an actor.</strong> <em>tttophonks</em></p><p>Because that’s not what I do. I play them. I think it is absolutely ridiculous that actors go on their bonus DVD interviews and explain what they were doing. That’s not what an actor does. An actor plays the part for <em>you</em> to make up your mind. I always quote Harrison Ford: “My job is not to tell you what I think about my character. My job is to tell you what you think about my character.” It’s completely counterproductive for an actor to talk about his part. If it requires explanation, you have to ask yourself a few questions. That’s why I don’t talk about the characters. <br /><br /><strong>I’ve always wanted to know what you would </strong><strong>be doing if you weren’t acting</strong><strong>. I’ve always imagined you as some kind of fixer for international hitmen</strong><strong>.</strong> <em>wildsville<br /></em><br />I don’t even know what a fixer for an international hitman does, but it’s a nice, poetic description of people’s image of me. It’s far too late to think about what I would have done. I wanted to be an artist, I wanted to be a cinematographer, then I became an actor. Why? That is open to speculation, especially on my part. I’ve been doing this for over 45 years. So you understand my hesitance to think about what I would have done had I not become an actor. Maybe I’d have become an alcoholic, or a bank president – or both. <br /><br /><strong>I can remember a very early interview </strong><strong>in which you actually predicted </strong><strong>that you would win an Oscar …</strong> <em>Red_Roland<br /></em><br />That’s incorrect. I never predicted that. If I did, then it was facetious. People run around thinking they will win the lottery, otherwise they wouldn’t be dumb enough to spend all that money. The chances that you win are millions to one. The chances that you will get run over when you cross the street are <em>infinitely</em> higher. Do you leave your house in the morning, thinking, “I’m going to be run over today”? Of course not. You go about your day, otherwise you couldn’t function. That’s exactly why I never said I would win an Oscar.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/27/christoph-waltz-my-only-regret-is-that-i-didnt-attack-nigel-farage-enough">Continue reading...</a>

## Il Proscritto review – Opera Rara unearth an uneven gem

<p><strong>Vargas/Roberts/Ayón-Rivas/Britten Sinfonia/Rizzi<br />(Opera Rara)<br /></strong>Saverio Mercadante’s opera of a love triangle in 17th-century Scotland is conducted with conviction by Carlo Rizzi and its complex heroine is beautifully sung by Irene Roberts</p><p>O<a href="https://opera-rara.com/">pera Rara</a>’s disinterring of forgotten works continues with this uneven gem by Saverio Mercadante, unheard for nearly two centuries but lifted from the Naples Conservatory archives by Carlo Rizzi, who conducts with pace and conviction. This studio recording was made around <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jun/29/il-proscritto-review-opera-rara-blow-the-dust-off-mercadantes-forgotten-opera">last summer’s concert</a> at the Barbican.</p><p>The story is a love triangle but, like much else in the opera, it’s a bit more interesting than the standard issue. Based on a well-known play of the era, it unfolds in exotic 17th-century Scotland – names such as Argyll and Murray are relished in idiomatic Italian pronunciation – with Oliver Cromwell as an unseen villain. The exile of the title, believed dead, returns on the day his “widow” Malvina is due to marry a political rival, a strategic match with whom she has nonetheless fallen in love. To resolve this hopeless situation, Malvina sacrifices herself through suicide – either to maintain everyone’s honour or perhaps just to prove a point.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/27/il-proscritto-review-saverio-mercadante-britten-sinfonio-carlo-rizzi">Continue reading...</a>

A few months ago, <strong>Kevin McCarthy</strong> appeared to be in a terrible position. He had been elected speaker of the House of Representatives, but only after an unprecedented 15 rounds of voting by his fractious Republican caucus, and it wasn’t hard to see a future where those same lawmakers lost patience with and ousted the Californian. But last night, McCarthy notched a victory when the House GOP <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/26/us-house-debt-ceiling-bill-passed-kevin-mccarthy">passed its proposal</a> to increase the US debt limit while also slashing government spending, despite several Republicans initially saying they wouldn’t support the bill. Democrats oppose the measure, and there’s no way <strong>Joe Biden</strong> signs it into law, at least not without significant changes. But for McCarthy, the fact that he got it passed with Republican votes alone despite their narrow majority in the House indicates he may be a more clever – and potentially durable – speaker than he’d been given credit for just a little bit ago.</p><p>Here’s what else is happening today:</p><p><strong>House Republicans</strong> are unveiling a proposal to address border security at 2:15 pm eastern time.</p><p><strong>White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre</strong> will brief reporters at 1:45 pm and likely bash the GOP debt ceiling bill, as the Biden administration has been doing for days.</p><p><strong>West Virginia governor Jim Justice</strong> makes a “special announcement” at 5 pm that’s reportedly a campaign for Senate, potentially pitting the Republican against Democratic incumbent <strong>Joe Manchin </strong>in a contest that could decide which party controls the chamber.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2023/apr/27/debt-ceiling-republicans-mccarthy-biden-trump-politics-live-updates">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Politics is intimately tied up with the ways the four artists on this year’s shortlist work, and in a divided world post-Brexit and Covid, this is reflected in their offerings</p><p>Younger, older, left field, established, overlooked, revitalised, expected, surprising: the annual Turner prize shortlist has over the decades been a mix of the puzzling and the predictable. The shortlists, and the jurors who select them, don’t come out of nowhere. More than a signal to artistic fashion and passing fads, the annual Turner exhibition is a sign of the times. It goes with and against the grain. Less now about big names and artists who are already validated and in the public eye, it gets more fragile and more contentious as it also becomes more unpredictable and more interesting.</p><p>Post-Brexit, post-Covid, working in a situation that is ever more fraught economically, and more socially divided and divisive, it is important that the prize reflects our situation, as this year’s shortlist does.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/27/the-intriguing-turner-prize-shortlist-is-a-sign-of-the-times">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Park theatre, London<br /></strong>David has cerebral palsy and is determined to lose his virginity using Grindr in Jon Bradfield’s entertaining play</p><p>Any Grindr user faces a barrage of questions. Top or bottom? 420? Pics? Fun? Host? To these, the candid comedy-drama Animal adds another: “Do you have level access for a wheelchair?” David (Christopher John-Slater) has cerebral palsy but that doesn’t mean he isn’t gagging for it. He is 25 and dismayed that his carers can’t bear to ask whether his virginity is still intact (it is), so in desperation he downloads the ubiquitous gay hook-up app. After initial worries – how can he reveal his vital statistics when he can’t hold a ruler? – he is soon sending devil emojis and dick pics with the best of them.</p><p>One of the strengths of Jon Bradfield’s play (from a story by Bradfield and Josh Hepple) is that David’s cherry is dispensed with briskly; in no time at all, he is accumulating notches on his bed-post. This necessitates video projection by Matt Powell and swift scene changes on Gregor Donnelly’s set of sliding panels and neon tubes. Multiple parts are shared among the six-strong cast. William Oxborrow is especially deft in a string of roles including, most provocatively, the infantilising brute who tells David to “be good for daddy” and then David’s actual father, bemused by his son’s sex life.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/apr/27/animal-review-park-theatre-london">Continue reading...</a>

Communicating with colleagues, players and managers, all while trying to make crucial decisions, looks like a thankless task. It was not the first time a referee has walked out to the centre-circle wearing a wire. ITV did something similar in February 1989, when they listened in on David Elleray while he officiated a Millwall v Arsenal league match.

## Sweet Tooth season two review – this fantasy drama pulls off a miracle

<p>It’s a brutal post-apocalyptic drama, but it somehow also manages to be perfect family fare. Its gripping storylines, violence and cute kids with animal features are a joy for all ages</p><p>So, there are a bunch of kids imprisoned in a cell, planning their escape. First, they need a scheme to get hold of the keys. What tools do they have at their disposal? The floor is earth, so it’s obvious: the child who’s half-chipmunk should burrow out. The kid with the lion’s mane, the girl with the pig’s nose and the little guy who has the full face and trunk of an elephant all agree. The chipmunk boy starts chewing the ground.</p><p>Welcome back to the singular world of Sweet Tooth, the pandemic dystopia drama the whole family can enjoy. If you missed season one: the world has been devastated by the Sick, a virus which sprung up and rapidly spread right at the same moment when babies started being born with animal features. In the absence of any other explanation, these “hybrids” are seen as dangerous vermin, routinely incarcerated or just killed by fearful humans. Previously we have been following Gus (Christian Convery), a 10-year-old boy with the ears, antlers and senses of a deer, as he crossed a ravaged America – at first he was looking for his mother, but he’s recently discovered that no such person exists. He is a scientific experiment, made in a lab, and he might be the key to the story of the hybrids and/or the hunt for a cure for the Sick. But he needs to break out of jail first.</p><p>Sweet Tooth is on Netflix.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/27/netflix-sweet-tooth-season-two-review-this-fantasy-drama-pulls-off-a-miracle">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The director of the intense new film about a scofflaw bike rider south of Paris, explains why they aim to film characters who escape all classification</p><p>‘She was riding in the middle of 50 bikers, pulling a super-aggressive gangster face.” Lola Quivoron is talking about the real-life inspiration for her urban motocross film <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nymQJmqVKDo">Rodeo</a>. “I think in order to front up enough to get through it. Because everyone was looking at her. Some people were laughing because she had a smaller motorbike than everyone else. Some people found her odd, others beautiful. But I was very impressed by the risks she was taking and by her strength.”</p><p>Quivoron had been hanging out with <a href="https://www.dirtyriderzcrew.com/">Dirty Riderz Crew</a>, a group of bikers from the Val-de-Marne <em>département</em> south-east of Paris, for a while before this transgressive apparition rode past. In the milieu of <em>cross-bitume</em> (urban motocross), where people pull gnarly stunts while engaged in Mad Max-style rallies, female riders were virtually non-existent. Already fascinated by this engine-revving, hydrocarbon-fugged scene, this was the first time Quivoron had actually identified with a rider: “She was my double – who I could’ve been.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/27/et-was-a-primitive-glimpse-of-my-queerness-lola-quivoron-on-aliens-motocross-and-non-binary-cinema">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With songs for Backstreet Boys and many more, he turned Sweden into a pop powerhouse – then died tragically young. His peers reflect on an underrated legacy</p><p>In producer Denniz Pop’s old studio in Stockholm, above the mugs of coffee and overflowing ashtrays, sat a cherry red light that he would trigger when he knew he had made a hit.

A well-known DJ on the Swedish music scene, the perpetual joker born Dag Krister Volle helped turn Sweden into a global pop powerhouse, recruiting a gaggle of young songwriters and producers, including a certain Max Martin, that would continue to define pop’s sound – think playful, funk-heavy R&amp;B fused with very Swedish major-chord choruses – even after his sudden death in 1998 aged just 35.</p><p>Recruited by Pop in 1993, Martin has since created 25 US No 1 singles, second only to Lennon and McCartney. “When he first invited me to work with him, I don’t know what he saw in me,” the interview-shy Martin tells me. “I didn’t know my way around a studio, but I guess he saw something.” His legacy lives on not just through his mentee, but also via Sweden’s annual Denniz Pop awards, which celebrate their 10th year this June. Under the stewardship of producer and songwriter Jacob Schulze, and an 11-person jury that also includes Martin and pop star Tove Lo, the awards aim to support the next generation of Swedish talent. Past winners have included newcomers Winona Oak and Oscar Stembridge, while everyone from Avicii to Mabel to Snoh Aalegra have scooped the night’s biggest award, the Grand Prize, which celebrates Swedish success on an international stage.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/27/a-true-genius-denniz-pop-the-late-scandi-pop-architect-behind-max-martin-robyn-and-nsync">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From the Green Man on King Charles’s coronation invitation to celebrations selling out across the UK, more and more people identify as pagan, or at least pagan-curious.

One of the eight festivals in the “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/29/paganism-part-3-wheel-year-dates">wheel of the year</a>”, Beltane is observed from 30 April to 1 May in the northern hemisphere and is an occasion for joyful ritual that marks the moment spring bursts into life, with fires, flower garlands – and perhaps a maypole.</p><p>“To be in a circle, to have a huge bel-fire and to jump the ashes into the full summer, it’s very life-enhancing,” says Adrian Rooke, a druid from the Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids (OBOD), which runs druidry courses. Annelli Stafford, a practising “eclectic” pagan and the organiser of <a href="http://www.celebratebeltane.co.uk/">Beltane at Thornborough Henge</a> in North Yorkshire, agrees: “It’s a really nice start to the year after a long, cold winter.” A regular since 2011, Stafford describes the energy and stunning skies at the three <a href="https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/about-us/search-news/thornborough-henges/">ancient henges</a>, and the event’s welcoming spirit. “There’s a full range from babies to old people with walkers and electric wheelchairs,” she says.

<p>A concert pianist is shadowed across Europe by her doppelganger in this virtuosic novel of identity and breakdown</p><p>Elsa Anderson, orphan, ex-prodigy and popular piano virtuoso, recently dyed her hair blue on a whim, then lost her nerve and walked off stage during a recital of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/sergei-rachmaninov">Rachmaninov</a>’s Piano Concerto No 2 in Vienna. Now she’s travelling across Europe, teaching piano, while she tries to understand why. Her hands are still insured for millions of dollars: before she walked off stage, they played two minutes and 12 seconds of a composition of her own. Now, in Athens, adrift and dissociated, self-image in ruins, she watches a woman buy the last two cheap toys at a flea market stall. The toys are mechanical dancing horses; the woman is herself.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/deborah-levy">Deborah Levy</a>’s ninth novel flickers constantly between comedy and darkness. Her prose is as quick and bare as ever, her manner excitingly abrupt. By page six she has set out her stall: the story is to be about how you construct yourself, and how that will always be a reconstruction. Elsa and her double are to be aware of one another from the outset, and in a sense their very doubledness will cancel – or at least unravel the idea of – what we might call identity. “My startling thought at that moment was that she and I were the same person. She was me and I was her. Perhaps she was a little more me than I was.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/27/august-blue-by-deborah-levy-review-how-to-construct-a-self">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Documentary about the trailblazing musician who influenced stars from the Beatles to Bowie also looks back at the artists who inspired him</p><p>Lisa Cortes’s documentary is an irresistible tribute to the pioneering rock’n’roll genius, whose wild transgressive energy and explosive sexuality blazed a trail and created a musical and performing language for James Brown, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Prince, Elton John, David Bowie, and many other stars – some of whom had the good grace to thank him.</p><p>And he is now considered a great queer artist, which is how many interviewees here describe him; Little Richard in fact described himself as gay, and the movie perhaps could have done more analytical work in thinking about the relationship between the two terms.

<p>Forget the quick fixes, such as yoga workshops and juice cleanses: lead a rewarding life, rather than chasing short-term pleasures</p><p>Most of us strive for a life where we feel we have real choices about how we spend our time and energy. But we get boggled in that pursuit – confused about where exactly we’re heading. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/21/self-care-radical-feminist-idea-mass-market">Self-care</a> has become a staple in our lives. From juice cleanses to yoga workshops, we are sold breezy fixes in pastel-coloured packages. This is faux self-care, but we are made to feel at fault when they don’t work. But we are not broken: the game is rigged against us.</p><p>Research on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing">well​­being</a> is divided into two theories of how to go about living a good life: the hedonic approach and the eudaimonic approach. Hedonic well​­being focuses on the feeling states of happiness and pleasure. In many respects, faux self-care – the diets, the cleanses, the retreats, the life hacks – is aligned with this, with its focus on what feels good in the moment and escaping difficult situations. Don’t get me wrong – we all need escape once in a while, and the ability to do so is a privilege. But eudaimonic wellbeing, by contrast, focuses on actions congruent with our values; it is the feeling that our lives are imbued with purpose.

## ‘We created our own weapon’: the anti-invasion magazines defying Putin in Ukraine

<p>Visually striking and politically strident, a new subgenre of magazines in Kyiv and Russia is sharing images and stories of the invasion to challenge ‘the Putin myth’</p><p>When 26-year-old documentary photographer Sebastian Wells travelled from Berlin to Ukraine shortly after the Russian invasion, he wasn’t entirely sure what he was going to do. “Many of my colleagues went directly to the frontline,” he explains from a sunny cafe in Kyiv. “I knew that wouldn’t be my role, but I didn’t know what else I should do. I spent two weeks in Kyiv getting frustrated and feeling like some kind of war tourist, and that’s when I started trying to find young creative people in the city.”</p><p>His first meeting was with 22-year-old fashion photographer Vsevolod Kazarin, and together the pair set about taking pictures of young people on the streets of Kyiv. Sharing a camera and an SD card, they assembled a series of street-style images, with their subjects photographed alongside sandbags, concrete barricades and anti-tank obstacles.<br /><br />They thought they could maybe use their images to create propaganda posters that they could send to friends in European cities, building bridges with young people across the EU and encouraging them to donate to Ukraine.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/27/magazines-art-photography-war-ukraine-russia">Continue reading...</a>

## The Seaside by Madeleine Bunting review – postcards from the edge

<p>A deeply reported account of what England’s seaside towns reveal about the state of the nation</p><p>When <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/vera-lynn" title="">Vera Lynn</a> sang about bluebirds over the white cliffs of Dover, the whole thing was a nonsense, or at least a colossal projection. The lyrics turn out to be by a New Yorker who had never set eyes on the bared teeth of Kent’s chalk coast, and didn’t realise that bluebirds are never seen outside North America. Still, without quite realising it, he had nailed a crucial point about the way Britain instinctively imagines itself in terms of its edges rather than its heartland, particularly in times of crisis.</p><p>In this remarkable book, as bracing as a smack in the face by a stiff sea breeze, Madeleine Bunting tours the English coastline to discover what it reveals about the state of the nation today. The result is far from being a nostalgic wander around seafronts and winter gardens with stories thrown in about the time <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/frank-sinatra" title="">Frank Sinatra</a> performed in Blackpool or Edward VII got in a round of golf at Frinton. Instead, Bunting, a former Guardian journalist who has written extensively on social affairs, plunges deep into the ugly truth: that for the last two decades at least, England’s seaside towns have experienced among the worst levels of deprivation in the country. Whether reporting from drizzly Lancashire, chilly Essex or the relatively mild south coast, she paints a shocking picture of endemic bad health, high debt and low educational attainment. All the things that go to make up what one local director of public health calls, with admirable candour, “shit life syndrome”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/27/the-seaside-by-madeleine-bunting-review-postcards-from-the-edge">Continue reading...</a>

## James Corden says goodbye to a changed late-night TV ecosystem

<p>The British actor-comedian leaves his Late Late Show – and Carpool Karaoke – after eight years and a series of PR troubles</p><p>It’s fitting that, as James Corden closes in on the end of his tenure as the host of The Late Late Show, the most enduring and headline-grabbing farewell will probably not come from the host’s chair in Los Angeles, but from one <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nV8UZJNBY6Y">final installment of Carpool Karaoke</a>. Though CBS will air a prime-time special commemorating the British actor-comedian’s eight years as host before his final episode on Thursday, it’s the show’s signature segment, in which a typically committed Corden and a celebrity guest enthusiastically belt out songs during the host’s “commute”, that became an institution, the show’s bulwark in the ever-jockeying field of late-night television.</p><p>Since Corden took over for the Scottish-American comedian Craig Ferguson in 2015, The Late Late Show, produced by Ben Winston (who has since also taken on the Grammys) and Rob Crabbe, has occupied a small corner of the linear television map. It’s the <a href="https://ustvdb.com/networks/cbs/shows/late-late-show-james-corden/">34th most watched show on CBS</a>; ratings have been <a href="https://www.ratingraph.com/tv-shows/the-late-late-show-with-james-corden-ratings-54818/">decently consistent</a> over the years, though of course minor compared with the pre-streaming heyday of late-night television. But its celebrity bits such as “Spill Your Guts or Fill Your Guts” (AKA “Truth or Eat Repulsive Food”), anywhere from grating (traffic-stopping crosswalk musicals) to inspired (directing a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVpzCrIt9Kg">Harry Styles music video</a> in a lucky rando’s apartment) allowed the show to punch far above its late time slot and ratings weight.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/apr/27/james-corden-late-late-show-ending">Continue reading...</a>

## 5-25-77 review – energetic ode to Star Wars, the movie that changed it all

<p>Love letter to sci-fi nerdiness, centred on the original release of the sci-fi blockbuster, was almost 20 years in the making – and it’s worth the wait</p><p>If any film merits the term “development hell”, it’s this. Patrick Read Johnson shot 5-25-77 between 2004 and 2006, when star John Francis Daley (now director of Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honour Among Thieves) was young enough to pass for its 17-year-old lead character; its special effects were only completed in the back half of the last decade. But this tortuous backstory entirely befits this autobiographical ode to cineaste passion and persistence, all hung on nerd D-day: 25 May 1977, the release of Star Wars (whose producer Gary Kurtz also oversaw this film and didn’t live to see it finished).</p><p>5-25-77 is geek film-making’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/sep/14/almost-famous-at-20-cameron-crowe-warm-hearted-ode-to-music-journalism">Almost Famous</a>. Fired up by an early viewing of 2001: A Space Odyssey, Illinois suburbanite Pat (Daley) is mad-keen on trying to replicate his favourite blockbusters by roping his friends, including the reliably sarcastic Bill (Steve Coulter), into shooting no-budget back yard versions. But he is going nowhere – not least with the ladies – until mother Janet (Colleen Camp) makes a phone call to Herb Lightman (Austin Pendleton), editor of American Cinematographer magazine. Pat finds himself on a plane to Los Angeles with a prospective hook-up at Future General Corporation, 2001 FX supremo Douglas Trumbull’s special projects lab.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/27/5-25-77-review-ode-to-cinema-movie-star-wars">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The problem is delaying probate and causing great distress</p><p><strong>My mum died in February and her energy supplier Ovo is refusing to return the £2,000 credit on her account. Ovo has admitted errors on her account, which date back to 2019, when a four-digit meter reading was substituted for the five-digit actual reading and used as a basis for subsequent bills. We provided meter readings and photographs, and an agent read the meter in 2021. We were assured that the account would be rectified, but that never happened and the issue is delaying probate. I’ve been told it may take up to 12 weeks to resolve. That £2,000 could have been used for mum’s funeral to give her a better send-off. The issue is causing great distress. <br /></strong><em><strong>ZW, London</strong></em></p><p>This makes painful reading. You have had to chase while coping with an inquest into your mother’s death, and ploughing through four years of energy bills. Notes scribbled on the bills by your mother suggest that she spent the last 14 months of her life, if not more, struggling to get her account recalibrated using correct meter readings. Her memos show that during repeated calls she was sometimes kept on hold for more than half an hour, and was passed fruitlessly between departments. At one point she records her distress at receiving a letter in intimidating red ink from Ovo demanding readings that she had already submitted.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/apr/27/mum-died-but-ovo-wont-refund-the-2000-credit-on-her-account">Continue reading...</a>

<p>New York exhibition of more than 200 menus traces US history through a century of dining</p><p>The buffet table at Abraham Lincoln’s second inaugural ball stretched over 250ft.

## The lesson from the Diane Abbott row: if we fight racism in silos, we just can’t win

<p>The row caused by her dreadful letter was depressing, but just as sad was what the furore revealed about modern racial politics</p><p>Long before Hackney North first elected Diane Abbott as its MP, my mother was a teacher in one of its primary schools. As a small boy I sometimes went with her, on long journeys by bus and train and across the wooden bridge over Clapton Pond, chanting about the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiy3a1v9Q2E">billy goats gruff</a>. <em>Trip trap, trip trap.</em></p><p>Visiting her staffroom was almost a whistle-stop tour of the British empire, with teachers from Jamaica, Trinidad, Nigeria, Pakistan, Cyprus and Ireland. All, I think, first-generation immigrants to the UK and all women – and all aware that those two things meant they wouldn’t get the money or the promotions they deserved. So they organised. My mother was in her trade union’s black caucus, which spoke for “all teachers who face racism”. This was London in the early 1980s, where the streets still echoed to the <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opendemocracyuk/what-anti-nazi-league-and-rock-against-racism-teach-us-about-how-to-defeat-fascists/">Anti-Nazi League</a>’s chant of “We are Black, We are White, together we are Dynamite”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/27/diane-abbott-racism-letter-racial-politics">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘At 83, I still feel sexual’: Smokey Robinson on love, joy, drugs, Motown – and his affair with Diana Ross

<p>The music legend has just released a fabulously filthy album. He looks back on his incredible life in songwriting, and his friendships with Marvin Gaye, Berry Gordy and Aretha Franklin</p><p>Smokey Robinson’s first collection of new songs in 14 years is gorgeous, tender and utterly filthy – a concept album about sex called Gasms. Robinson, 83, admits he thought the title would be good for business. “When people think of gasms, they think of orgasms first and foremost … I tell everybody: ‘Whatever your gasm is, that’s <em>exactly</em> what I’m talking about.’” He bursts out laughing. Within seconds of meeting him, you can tell this is a man who’s done a hell of a lot of laughing, loving and living.</p><p>On the title track, Robinson sings about eyegasms, eargasms, the whole gamut of gasms. If there is any danger of missing the point, he throws in double entendres that verge on the single. He sings with the silky falsetto of yesteryear, the words perfectly phrased as ever. The album ranges from the exultant (“We’re each other’s ecstasy”) on Roll Around to the biological (“If you got an inner vacancy / Baby, then make it a place for me”) on I Fit in There.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/27/at-83-i-still-feel-sexual-smokey-robinson-on-love-joy-drugs-motown-and-his-affair-with-diana-ross">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From Beatrice attending his meetings to proposing cinema get-togethers at Buckingham Palace, a new documentary digs into how the Newsnight debacle happened</p><p>A Pizza Express in Woking. The inability to sweat. A tendency to be “too honourable”. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtBS8COhhhM">Prince Andrew’s 2019 Newsnight interview</a> was a bonanza of bizarre excuses – in which he disastrously tried to defend himself from allegations that he had sex with a 17-year-old girl trafficked by his friend Jeffrey Epstein. Greeted with a riot of disbelief, anger and meme-making by the public, it was the most explosive royal interview of the decade. But how on Earth did it happen in the first place?</p><p>A new documentary, airing as part of Channel 4’s alternative coronation coverage, is lifting the lid on this remarkably misguided interview. But Andrew: The Problem Prince kicks off with an entirely different TV appearance. It’s 1985 and the prince is primarily known as a pin-up, playboy and the Falklands hero who risked his life for his country. He is also known as Randy Andy, a nickname referenced by his interviewer on this occasion, a giggling <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/jan/04/i-did-hate-tv-selina-scott-on-trump-prince-andrew-frank-bough-and-the-bbc">Selina Scott</a>. Andrew shrugs it off with remarkably easy charm and humour. The audience howls in approval. “It was a badge of honour then – the idea of this young prince cutting a swathe through the aristocratic women of London was something to be admired,” says James Goldston, former president of ABC News and one of the documentary’s producers. “There was zero conversation at the time about: are there ethical or moral issues involved in this?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/27/set-up-for-failure-the-wild-story-behind-the-car-crash-interview-which-destroyed-prince-andrew">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Flattering biopic zooms entertainingly through an extraordinary, switchback career <br /></p><p>The extraordinary and long-gestating comeback story of heavyweight boxing champ George Foreman has taken a long time to tell, perhaps because he has lived his life in Muhammad Ali’s shade, especially since Ali’s sensational underdog victory over him in the 1974 Rumble in the Jungle. In movie terms, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_We_Were_Kings">Leon Gast’s thrilling 1996 documentary When We Were Kings</a> turned Foreman into the bad guy who deserved to lose – particularly the nasty macho detail about Foreman having a German shepherd on a lead when he turned up in Zaire for the fight.</p><p>That dog does not appear in this watchable, celebratory biopic from director and co-screenwriter George Tillman Jr, with Foreman credited as executive producer. Khris Davis plays Foreman; Forest Whitaker plays his trainer Doc Broadus and Sonja Sohn is his mother Nancy. The movie thumps through successive events of Foreman’s amazing life in efficient, unsubtle, on-the-nose style, skating over his many marriages a little.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/27/big-george-foreman-review-from-heavyweight-star-to-born-again-and-back">Continue reading...</a>
