It's a similar conversation I have with my niece when a game doesn't go her way. Plus as conservatives, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/victoria-azarenka-australian-open\" target=\"_blank\">seeing any reporter</a> get it <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/desantis-thug-life-media\" target=\"_blank\">thrown back in their face for any reason whatsoever</a> gives us the warm fuzzies.</p><p>Though I cop to not knowing much about the NBA other than a) Giannis is really good, b) he's Greek (shout out Pantellis), and c) I'm supposed to fear the deer. The Bucks got knocked out of the playoffs. A reporter asked Giannis if it means they were failures.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">Giannis is outstanding: \u201cThere\u2019s no failure in sports.

No. Every year you work, you work towards something, towards a goal, right, which is to get a promotion, to be able to take care of your family. Provide a house for them or take care of your parents.</blockquote><p>Exactly. You are either winning or you're learning. I got that from MMA coach Duke Rufous. He's out of Wisconsin too. It must be something in the cheese.</p><p>You lose a competition, sure. It's a competition. There can be only one winner, and if you aren't playing to win there's no point.

Crowder set the scene by breaking down Tucker's <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tucker-carlson-speaks-twitter\" target=\"_blank\">comeback video</a> from last night. Crowder explained what some of the things Carlson said in this video actually mean - notably, that Tucker hinted at censorship going on at places like Fox, and that he might be aware of some unflattering texts or emails of his that could leak soon. This is what leads to the \"shakedown\". </p><p>Crowder then got to some of the new information that has come to light, namely, the lawsuit against <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tucker-carlson-breaks-silence\" target=\"_blank\">Tucker</a> filed by his former booking producer. This lawsuit will likely lead to discovery and reveal texts, emails, etc. that will be taken out of context and used against him. Mainstream media is already reporting on \"crude\" text messages of his, as well as \"vulgarities\" he allegedly used to describe women and anti-semitic jokes. </p><p>Oh, and the booking producer suing him has actually never met him. Small detail. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cAbby Grossberg NEVER met Tucker.\\u201d</div> \u2014 Steven Crowder (@Steven Crowder)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/scrowder/status/1651603049687777280\">1682607827</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The broad suing him appeared on MSNBC and said Tucker and his Executive Producer were responsible for \"breaking\" her and making her life \"a living hell\". Remember, never once met him. <br /></p><p>Crowder pointed out how if Tucker had done something <em>truly</em> terrible, we would know about it. These vague descriptions of his alleged infractions hint that they don't actually have anything on him. Fox News also apparently has a \"dossier\" of dirt on Tucker that they are prepared to release if he goes after the network. Crowder pointed out that they are reporting this preemptively, so if Tucker tries to defend himself, they'll claim he attacked them first. And for years to come, these allegations against Tucker will be the first thing to come up in Google search results. </p><p>There was a lot more on this topic, as well as a segment on a new \"queer\" western film.

Or perhaps it's even more simple- they don't like him. </p><p>Licht released a very tasteful statement on his firing: <em>\"CNN and Don have parted ways. Don will forever be part of the CNN family, and we thank him for his contributions over the past 17 years. We wish him well and will be cheering him on in his future endeavors.\u201d</em></p><p>It could have had something to do with Lemon's comments over women, most notably the now infamous \"<a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/don-lemon-cnn-poppy-harlow\" target=\"_blank\">past her prime</a> jab at Nikki Haley. Some rumors claim it was related to Lemon's spar with Vivek Ramaswamy over gun rights and the Civil War. Whatever it is, Al Sharpton will get to the bottom of it.

It's why on Twitter we ask how you plan to enjoy a politics-free weekend. We ALL need a break outside of the noise. Noise that will still be there on Monday after we take a few days to watch little league, do a project around the house, day drink, etc.</p><p>Where Tucker sends the signal as to what his future holds is his revelation about how stupid cable news is.</p><blockquote>This is the amazing thing, the undeniably big topics, the ones that will define our future, get virtually no discussion at all: war, civil liberties, emerging science, demographic change, corporate power, natural resources. When was the last time you heard a legitimate debate about any of those issues? It\u2019s been a long time. Debates like that are not permitted in American media. Both political parties and their donors have reached consensus on what benefits them, and they actively collude to shut down any conversation about it.</blockquote><p>It's everything Crowder has been preaching since the beginning of MugClub. It's why Joe Rogan's podcast has become so popular. You can only cover these stories or get to the bottom of these issues in a longform format. One where you aren't dependent on corporate sponsors. You can't have a rational discussion about important issues on cable news, let alone a debate. </p><p>For starters, the majority of employees at media networks don't hide their loathing towards any non-radical left viewpoint. Turns out, that includes Fox News. But also, you can't discuss issues in eight-minute segments between commercial breaks where three or more people have time for two talking points and MAYBE a snarky quip.</p><p>Tucker sounds like going to go the <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/megyn-kelly-keith-olbermann\" target=\"_blank\">Megyn Kelly</a>/Steven Crowder/<a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/james-okeefe-dylan-mulvaney\" target=\"_blank\">James O'Keefe</a> route. He's going to go into business for himself. Cover the stories HE finds important and the debates on the big issues that aren't discussed on cable news. Ones that matter to the American people. </p><p>I'll give you hint: unless you are driving around in your truck with banners flying or standing on the street corner holding up signs, you don't care about the minute-by-minute whereabouts of Donald Trump as much as CNN does.</p><p>What people <em>DO</em> care about? War, civil liberties, emerging science, demographic change, corporate power, natural resources, ad how all of these things affect supporting your family.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tucker-carlson-breaks-silence\" target=\"_blank\">As I said yesterday</a> and to again paraphrase Segio from <em>Get Him to the Greek</em>, Tucker gonna be fine.
