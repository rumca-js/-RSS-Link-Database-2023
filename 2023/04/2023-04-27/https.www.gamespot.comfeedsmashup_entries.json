Plunder is played in quads, and the goal is to be the team to collect the most cash, which is earned by killing and looting enemies, completing contracts, and looting supply boxes throughout the map. There are some major differences in Warzone 2's Plunder, so here we provide some tips to help you score cash the fastest, and hopefully, secure some wins.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Stay focused on the money</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">In this version of battle royale, you drop into a match with your custom loadout and respawns are enabled. This means you don't need to look for better guns or unnecessarily pick fights with your opponents, you just need to go straight for some cash.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Know where and what to loot</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Plunder matches can progress quickly, so it's best to land somewhere that will have decent loot and contracts. Even if you normally play passively in battle royale, keeping to the low-key areas and outskirts of the map, you'll want to pick hotter drops for Plunder. Places like Al Mazrah City or the Sattiq Cave Complex have so many loot-filled buildings that make them great areas for cash hauls. I'd suggest looking at the contracts available in the area before dropping and picking the area with the most Safecracker contracts nearby.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-2-plunder-tips-how-to-make-money-fast/1100-6513658/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-2-plunder-tips-how-to-make-money-fast/1100-6513658/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-04-27 17:26:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "The Case Of The Golden Idol: The Spider Of Lanka DLC Adds More Mystery To The Indie Hit", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">PlayStack's The Case Of The Golden Idol quickly became one of the major indie successes of 2022 thanks to its unique mystery-solving gameplay.

This is a sequel to a popular AAA video game, and with that comes the expectation that it's going to be a longer, more involved story. For better or worse, Respawn meets, or possibly even exceeds, those expectations in its latest globe-trotting Jedi saga. Here's what you need to know about how long it takes to beat Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.</p><h2>How long is Star Wars Jedi: Survivor?</h2><p>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is a sprawling sequel and will take players approximately <strong>20-25 hours to complete its story</strong>. As is often the case with games of this size, however, that only begins to tell the full story.</p><p>This estimate accounts for someone sticking largely to the critical path and the main story missions. For most players, more exploration will come into play. This means <strong>an average playthrough is likely closer to 30-35 hours</strong> for players completing the main story plus some (but not all) optional quests and other content.
