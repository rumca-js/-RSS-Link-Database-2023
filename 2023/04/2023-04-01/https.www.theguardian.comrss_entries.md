A <em>very</em> premature stoppage, surely. Next up: Anthony Joshua v Jermaine Franklin.</p><p><strong>Hello and welcome to the O2 Arena for tonight’s non-title fight between Anthony Joshua and Jermaine Franklin.</strong> It’s the textbook definition of a crossroads bout for Joshua, the former two-time world champion who is coming off consecutive losses to Oleksandr Usyk. The 2012 Olympic gold medalist desperately needs a career-reviving performance against Franklin, a fringe contender from Saginaw, Michigan, who earned his shot as Joshua’s comeback opponent by giving Dillian Whyte a scare in November.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/apr/01/anthony-joshua-v-jermaine-franklin-world-heavyweight-boxing-live">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Spurs need a hungry manager on the way up, rather than one – no matter how young – fighting for relevance</p><p>If only Julian Nagelsmann had never become manager of Bayern Munich, the world might have believed he would be a very good manager of Bayern Munich. It was a job to which he had seemed destined since becoming the youngest coach in Bundesliga history in 2016, taking charge of Hoffenheim at the age of 29. He had already led Hoffenheim’s under-19s to the Bundesliga youth title. He seemed preternaturally gifted and in Germany the gifted always end up at Bayern, especially when they come from Bavaria.</p><p>Taking over with Hoffenheim seven points adrift, Nagelsmann inspired them to unlikely survival and the following season took them into the Champions League. After a third-place finish in 2017- 18, Nagelsmann’s upward journey continued at RB Leipzig, as he took them to the Champions League semi-finals. A Bundesliga title in his first season at Bayern may have been expected, but his first silverware was no less welcome for that.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/apr/01/tottenham-beware-nagelsman-has-reached-a-crisis-point-in-his-career">Continue reading...</a>

Opponents want to shake his hand. Fans want to sing his name. Club staff want to make eye contact and slap him on the back. As he takes his lap of honour, a lone camera operator follows him around the entire pitch, training his lens on that soft, twinkling face, a face that for some reason always looks as though it’s on the verge of bursting into tears.</p><p>And for some reason there has always been this peculiarly spellbinding quality to Jesus. You watch him not because of what he’s doing, but because of what he might do.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/apr/01/gabriel-jesus-has-the-spellbinding-quality-that-keeps-everyone-watching">Continue reading...</a>

Research by Harvard finds workers’ bargaining pay is increased by a host of policies, but makes employers wary of granting raises<p>In the old days, people thought talking about money, particularly how much you earn, was unimaginably vulgar. But as anyone who has met a banker recently knows, those days are gone. It’s not just the minted who favour pay transparency; less loaded lefties do too - for social progress rather than social point scoring reasons.

<p>The American novelist, whose latest work is a fake biography of an avant-garde artist, on growing up in Mississippi and why her fiction has ‘never actively involved cellphones or the internet’</p><p>Catherine Lacey, 37, is the author of three previous novels, including <em>The Answers</em>, currently being adapted for television by Darren Aronofsky, and <em>Pew</em> (2020), about a nameless amnesiac of ambiguous race and gender. Her new novel, <em>Biography of X</em>, set in a parallel America, follows a widow untangling the life story of her wife, an avant-garde artist known as X. The <em>New York Times</em> has called it “sprawling and ambitious… strange and dystopian”. Lacey, one of <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/26/granta-list-best-young-american-novelists">Granta</a></em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/26/granta-list-best-young-american-novelists">’s best young American novelists in 2017</a>, was speaking from her home in Brooklyn.<br /><br /><strong>Which part of the book came first: the alternate history or the fake biography?</strong><br />I liked the idea of writing a fake biography and the biographies I like best are usually written by someone with some kind of compromised perspective. I thought the worst person to write a biography would be a surviving spouse with a bit of a grudge, but I didn’t want to get into the heterosexual dynamics of a man writing about a woman or a woman writing about a man; it had to be two women. At the same time, I wanted the novel to be set in the mid-20th century but I wasn’t interested in writing about the actual struggles a prominent lesbian couple would have gone through in that time. So my alternate history grew out of that problem. I thought, if I have an America where this female artist could exist and this couple could exist without having to justify themselves, I just need a totally different America.<br /><strong><br />As a workaround, it hardly cut corners.</strong><br />I liked that! I started the novel in 2016 at the same time that I was writing <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/26/pew-by-catherine-lacey-review-when-silence-speaks-volumes">Pew</a></em>, which takes place in a week and was so spare. I’d decided to make myself write <em>Pew</em> quickly to see what would happen; I found that I can do it, I just prefer not to. <em>Biography of X</em> was more a kind of collecting project that I knew would take longer.</p><p><strong>Where do the various photographs of X come from?</strong><br />A lot of them I found in junk shops; for the images of her books, I commissioned jackets from a book designer.<br /><br /><strong>Why did you include real names from the art and book world?</strong><br />I saw it as another tool to make the novel as much like a biography as possible. There’s a quote [used in the book] from the <em>New Yorker</em> critic <a href="https://www.merveemre.com/">Merve Emre</a> that is actually something she wrote about a Susan Sontag biography. There are a lot of names in there. A lot of them I made up.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/01/catherine-lacey-that-constant-nervous-twitter-energy-repels-me-biography-of-x">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Pep Guardiola’s charisma magnet is in mesmeric form, but predictable Liverpool should not be this easy to work out</p><p>Is anyone in Britain currently having more fun than Jack Grealish? Two minutes before the end of this 4-1 annihilation of Liverpool at the Etihad Stadium Grealish left the pitch to a standing ovation, met by a tender, oddly sensual full body hug from Pep Guardiola, who for a while just wouldn’t let him go, patting his buttocks, whispering in his ear, hungry for Jack love.</p><p>It isn’t hard to see why Guardiola likes Grealish. He has a way of turning mavericks, flashy destroyers, skill poppets into team cogs. And Grealish does things Pep likes, holding the ball as well as anyone, providing control and a safe space on the left. Also, isn’t there just a little bit of nerd-love for Pep’s hype man, his charisma magnet, the coolest kid in the class?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/apr/01/jack-grealish-manchester-citys-coolest-kid-teaches-liverpool-a-lesson">Continue reading...</a>

## Gabriel Jesus doubles up to see off Leeds and keep Arsenal on track

<p>As you were. Arsenal needed a trouble-free afternoon and, after a scratchy first third of this game, sailed home with the most comfortable three points they will earn all season. Any stumble would have looked all the more significant given the manner of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/01/manchester-city-liverpool-premier-league-match-report">Manchester City’s earlier success</a> but the outcome was in scant doubt from the moment Gabriel Jesus opened the scoring with a penalty 10 minutes before half-time. He would double his tally, in a timely return to scoring form, after a goal from Ben White; a reply from Rasmus Kristensen never felt consequential and was quickly followed by Granit Xhaka’s third goal in as many club games. Mikel Arteta can reflect that the first stage of a 10-game sprint was completed with little fuss.</p><p>The burning question was how Arsenal would handle playing straight after such a statement win from their closest rivals. It is that time of the season now: when the slightest slip contains agonies that may be felt for weeks. Therefore it did not seem like the moment for Arteta to face life without Bukayo Saka, but the Premier League’s best player since August was only fit for a place on the bench after missing training through illness. Saka had not failed to start a top-flight game since December 2021.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/01/arsenal-leeds-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The party is targeting ‘disillusioned suburbans’ like those in the Hertfordshire town, but what do actual Stevenage women think?</p><p>The Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton, the author EM Forster and composer Elizabeth Poston are all featured on Stevenage’s wall of fame along the walkway between the station and town centre.

<p>(Blue Note)<br />By turns elegant and mile-a-minute, the Texan makes his collaborative Blue Note debut with this classy set of originals – and a Kate Bush cover</p><p>What is it with <a href="https://www.waltersmith3.com/">Walter Smith III </a>and “casual”? The Texas saxophonist’s debut album in 2005 was titled <em>Casually Introducing</em>, and a decade later, on his fourth, he assured us he was <em>Still Casual</em>. For his <a href="https://www.bluenote.com/artist/walter-smith-iii/">debut on Blue Note</a> he has gathered that album’s six-strong cast for <em>Return to Casual</em>, on which he restates his qualities as a tenor sax player for our times, his airy tone echoing the past – specifically, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/dec/12/dexter-gordon-montmartre-1964-review">Dexter Gordon</a> – while embracing the hard-nosed intricacy of post-bop.</p><p>It’s an engaging and diverse set of originals, the exception being a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqBAI5UHMMw">cover of Kate Bush’s Mother Stands for Comfort</a>. Much of it is far from casual. The opener, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMpkoXwZhHY">Contra</a>, named after a computer game from Smith’s childhood and appropriately playful, is taken at a furious clip, with assistance from guitarist Matt Stevens and drummer Kendrick Scott. River Styx is a more elegant affair, lifted by the trumpet of Ambrose Akinmusire, and the supporting players are given space on the six minutes of Shine. After the nagging riff of Pup – Pow, more reflective moods include that Kate Bush cover (a sensuous replay of a tricky melody) and Revive, a bluesy, late-night piece where Smith duets beautifully with pianist Taylor Eigsti. A sumptuous treat.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/01/walter-smith-iii-return-to-casual-review-kate-bush-cover">Continue reading...</a>

<p>More than just a reboot, this new chapter in the role-playing game franchise is a wonderful piece of world-building</p><p>Well, this is refreshing. <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honour Among Thieves</em> is that vanishingly rare entity – a riotously entertaining family-friendly film that hasn’t been painfully squeezed out of a comic-book franchise like the last, forlorn dregs of toothpaste from a long-dead tube. Admittedly, this isn’t the first film to be based on the enduringly popular fantasy role-playing game – Jeremy Irons starred in a critically reviled version in 2000; a made-for-TV sequel and direct-to-DVD third instalment followed. But <em>Honour Among Thieves</em> is more than a reboot – it’s a fleshed-out, multidimensional piece of world-building, with immediately likable characters, plenty of face-crunching, axe-based fight choreography and a running joke about potatoes.</p><p>Kudos to John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein, who co-wrote and co-directed the picture. As a creative partnership, they have experience in reboots – they co-wrote <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jul/09/spider-man-homecoming-review-tom-holland-michael-keaton">Spider-Man: Homecoming</a></em> – and board games, having co-directed the comedy thriller <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/04/game-night-review-rachel-mcadams-jason-bateman">Game Night</a></em>. With this picture, they strike a satisfying balance between character and action, and ensure that the digital effects are in service of the story, rather than the other way around.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/01/dungeons-dragons-honour-among-thieves-review-riotously-enjoyable-fantasy-adventure">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Perfect for Easter, this fluffy cake covered in chocolatey buttercream could be your favourite afternoon treat</p><p>It’s always a good time for a slice of chocolate cake, and there are numerous styles to choose from, depending on your mood. For an after-dinner dessert, I’d go for a dense, barely sweet, flourless number, but for something more suited to an afternoon treat, this fluffier cake covered in chocolatey buttercream is my go-to. Chocolate and hazelnuts have been friends since the beginning of time, and I love the extra crunch you get from the chopped nuts scattered in the middle. I’ve used a shop-bought chocolate hazelnut spread for ease – there are plenty of good-quality options out there to choose from.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/apr/01/chocolate-buttermilk-hazelnut-easter-cake-recipe-benjamina-ebuehi">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Coliseum; Kings Place; Queen Elizabeth Hall, London</strong><br />ENO give a thoughtful account of Korngold’s uneven study of loss; Manchester Collective revel in an eerie George Crumb masterpiece; and Streetwise Opera tell a five-star tale of three cities</p><p>The central character in <em>Die tote Stadt</em> (1920) keeps a plait of his dead wife’s hair in a glass jar and fantasises about a doppelganger sex goddess. Erich Korngold’s youthful work plays to our worst fears of loss and loneliness. Called <strong><a href="https://www.eno.org/whats-on/the-dead-city/">The Dead City</a></strong> in English National Opera’s new staging, this is the second production for the company by its artistic director, Annilese Miskimmon, following success last year with <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/16/the-handmaids-tale-eno-english-national-opera-london-review-le-chemin-de-la-croix-martin-baker-st-johns-smith-square-easter-festival">The Handmaid’s Tale</a></em>. Again she has made a taxing choice. Despite the overdue recognition of Korngold (1897-1957), <em>Die tote Stadt</em> – banned by the Nazis then neglected for decades – is still a relative rarity. The Austrian-born composer moved to the US and triumphed in the golden age of 1930s and 40s Hollywood. That popularity long scuppered his wider “serious” reputation. His fertile gift for melody shines through <em>The Dead City</em>.</p><p>Written in the aftermath of the first world war and based on Georges Rodenbach’s short novel <em>Bruges-la-</em><em>Morte</em> (1892), the work is often spoken of as a study of grief. Grief, we might argue, is more nuanced, an ebb and flow. The dominant force here, annihilating, engulfing, crushing all in sight, is obsession. Two lead singers (the Swiss tenor Rolf Romei and British soprano <a href="https://www.allisonoakes.info/">Allison Oakes</a>), playing lovers of a hallucinatory kind, hurtle and soar above the tidal waves of Korngold’s rich, fortissimo orchestral music. Theirs is a prolonged cry of agony, a vortex of mutual incomprehension. The pauses, when they come, as in the lovely Pierrot’s Song, are balm.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/01/the-dead-city-english-national-opera-eno-coliseum-london-annilese-miskimmon-manchester-collective-black-angels-george-crumb-kings-place-resound-voices-of-our-cities-streetwise-opera-bbc-concert-orchestra-the-sixteen">Continue reading...</a>

Symmetrically perfect imagery. Intense attention to period detail. An almost comically overstuffed cast of A-listers. (Good to see that Wes has chucked in a budding unknown by the name of Tom Hanks this time around, just to even things up.) Dialogue so arch McDonald’s could sue it for copyright infringement. Great needle drops. A bearded Jason Schwartzman – that one’s an absolute deal-breaker for Anderson.

The WBC said there was no conclusive evidence that the 26-year-old had deliberately taken a banned drug, but disagreed with him, and the contents of the report, as to the reasons for the presence of clomifene in his system on two separate occasions.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/apr/01/eddie-hearn-conor-benn-and-the-poison-at-the-heart-of-british-boxing">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The poet and author<em> </em>grew up in a coastal village defined by hardship and scenic beauty. What would she find when she returned to an area with some of the lowest wages and highest property prices in the country?</p><p>There is a part of me that hates the village I grew up in. How each house and path and landmark holds some catch-breath memory as I walk the two-mile-long coastal road that connects Seaton to Downderry. Memories that are embedded in every step, the places where I grew up and the places where my father, his parents and their families were born, lived and died, our initials still scratched in concrete in each and every footing, but built over now with extensions, double driveways, patios.</p><p>The road is the same but the buildings are higher, and the pockets of green have been paved, the trees where we used to play in front of our flat replaced by too-big houses. The upper reaches of the village are no longer a sea of green: nothing left of the swath of gold that was our daffodil field but two neat borders of yellow in the front garden of a solitary oversized house. Past the shop on the left and the butcher’s that’s now a house on the right, the working men’s club that has been rebranded for the blow-ins as a soulless village hall, then finally down the dog shit-covered path that passes the pub and the wall where we working-class kids used to sit and drink and think about the purpose of all of this.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/01/natasha-carthew-on-cornish-beauty-and-brutality">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As he prepares to face Saracens in the Champions Cup, the fly-half is thankful for a rise in his fortunes as the game battles to survive</p><p>There are few people better placed to pass judgment on the precariousness of life as a rugby player in the UK than the Ospreys fly-half Owen Williams. In a little over six months he has broken his thumb, been made redundant, stepped straight into the frying pan that is Welsh regional rugby, become a father and made his first international start, during the Six Nations. Most players go their whole careers experiencing less.</p><p>Williams can be forgiven for sounding a little weary as he reflects on the events of this season. On the endless days spent recovering from his injury, watching the number of Worcester players training together dwindle as the lucky ones picked up offers at other clubs. On joining the Ospreys as injury cover and producing the sort of form to make Warren Gatland take note, all the while seeing teammates driven to the brink by uncertainty over their futures brought out by the dispute that came to a head in the week of Wales against England – the very match where Williams wore the national No 10 jersey for the first time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/apr/01/ospreys-owen-williams-rugby-is-the-worst-ive-seen-it-since-ive-been-a-professional">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘We want to read about people falling in love’: Curtis Sittenfeld and Marian Keyes on the romcom revival

<p>The American and Irish novelists discuss the joys of writing romance, standing up to the critics and why we’re in a ‘golden age’ for the menopause</p><p>Curtis Sittenfeld is the author of seven novels, including American Wife and Rodham, reimaginings of the lives of Laura Bush and Hillary Clinton. Her new novel, Romantic Comedy, revolves around a TV sketch show based on Saturday Night Live, and dissects celebrity culture in a love story set during the pandemic, much of which takes place via email exchange. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/marian-keyes">Marian Keyes</a> is the author of 15 bestselling novels, several of which centre on the daughters of the Walsh family; the most recent is Again, Rachel. Her books frequently feature characters dealing with issues such as addiction, bereavement and domestic violence. She is also the co-host, with Tara Flynn, of the BBC Radio 4 advice programme Now You’re Asking. Their conversation took place over Zoom with both authors in their homes, Sittenfeld in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Keyes in Dun Laoghaire, Dublin.</p><p><strong>Marian Keyes:</strong> I was so excited when I heard that a new book from you was coming, because I would read anything you write. And I was thrilled at the idea of Curtis Sittenfeld writing in the romance genre. When I finished the last book I wrote, I had a big plan for a novel about a group of six characters who had been friends for 40 years. And one of them had become a kind of quite evil rich person. But when it came to starting it, I couldn’t do it, because the world after the pandemic just got worse. And I thought, I just want to write something lovely, where the stakes are kind of low, except on a personal level. So I started writing another love story. It really seems that people want to read about people falling in love and being good to each other. Because the world is so sharp and pointy, we need something nicer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/01/curtis-sittenfeld-and-marian-keyes-on-the-romcom-revival">Continue reading...</a>

## Thomas Tuchel has chance to prove his staying power at Bayern Munich | Jonathan Liew

<p>Title showdown with former club Borussia Dortmund hints at short-term punt but move may give team best shot at stability</p><p>Bayern Munich are by no means immune to mistakes, but they rarely make the same mistake twice. The ground lost to Borussia Dortmund between 2010 and 2012 was spectacularly recaptured, along with many of the rival club’s best players. The abortive reign of Carlo Ancelotti in 2016 seems to have warned the club hierarchy off the allure of the star foreign manager. And the remarkable chain of events that has reconfigured the landscape of German football over the past fortnight may just have its origins in Bayern’s failed pursuit of a promising young coach called Thomas Tuchel.<br /><br />Tuchel had been on Bayern’s radar as early as 2014, when Pep Guardiola began to recommend the Mainz coach as a potential successor. Cordial meetings were held with the sporting director, Michael Reschke, and the club president, Uli Hoeness. But it was in 2018, when the veteran coach Jupp Heynckes announced his retirement, that the chase really began. Heynckes publicly anointed Tuchel as his chosen successor and talks were arranged. But Bayern were too late. Tuchel had made up his mind to go abroad, and would soon be unveiled as the manager of Paris Saint-Germain.</p><p>If Julian Nagelsmann was unnerved at the prospect of Tuchel returning to the job market, he did a good job of hiding it. As his Bayern squad broke up for the international break after the 2-1 defeat at Bayer Leverkusen, there was little portent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/23/bayern-munich-sack-julian-nagelsmann-and-prepare-to-appoint-thomas-tuchel">of the approaching chaos</a>. “Everyone come back healthy from the internationals,” Nagelsmann warned his team in what would be their final meeting together. “And then we’ll smash Dortmund!” At which point Nagelsmann went skiing in the Austrian Alps with his girlfriend. He would only find out late on the Thursday night via media reports that his job had been given to Tuchel.<br /><br />It seemed logical enough, even if the shock value at the time was real. Beat Dortmund at the Allianz Arena this Saturday – as they have done in each of their last eight meetings at home – and Bayern will return to the top of the Bundesliga, presumptive favourites to win their 11th title in a row. This season’s Champions League <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/08/bayern-munich-psg-champions-league-last-16-match-report">has produced eight wins out of eight</a>. But then raw numbers have never kept any Bayern manager safe. This is a club where coaches are hired and fired largely on feel and projection, the vague but compelling idea that some basic essence has been lost. “This is not what Bayern stands for,” the current sporting director, Hasan Salihamidzic, said scornfully after the defeat to Leverkusen, and in retrospect this was the point at which we should have realised that change was coming.<br /><br />And something <em>has</em> undoubtedly been slightly off at Bayern this season, even if it is hard to pin down exactly what. There were few signs of dressing-room disaffection, and indeed over the international window many Bayern players expressed their surprise at Nagelsmann’s sacking. Certainly results since the World Cup have been substandard, allowing a surging Dortmund to go top for the first time in almost four years. Eleven points dropped from winning positions hints at a certain brittleness and an occasional tendency to concede soft goals. But there is nothing like a smoking gun here.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/01/thomas-tuchel-julian-nagelsmann-bayern-munich-borussia-dortmund">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Why mine so close?’: the fight to protect the pristine Okefenokee swamp

<p>An Alabama company wants to mine near the 440,000-acre Georgia swamp, but locals and scientists fear it could be irreparably harmed</p><p>Humans, as a general rule, are rather unkind to swamps. They are disparaged as rotten places that must be drained, either literally, to make way for farmland and houses, or metaphorically, to make way for demagogues. It’s to this backdrop that one of the last remaining intact large swamps in the US, a pristine wetland almost unrivaled anywhere in the world, finds itself under threat from a planned mining project.</p><p>The Okefenokee swamp, found in the deep southern reaches of Georgia, may lack the fame of the fabled national parks of the US, but it is no less remarkable. Untouched by development, the 440,000-acre (180,000-hectare) swamp is a sort of time machine, offering an idea of what this mosaic of pine islands, with its riot of wildlife, would have looked shortly after its formation about 7,000 years ago.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/01/georgia-okefenokee-swamp-twin-pines-mining">Continue reading...</a>

## Beef: Ali Wong ’s rage-fuelled drama is one of the most riveting shows of the year

<p>This dark, hilarious series sees a chance encounter send two strangers tumbling down a rabbit hole of revenge. It’s an early contender for the best-of-the-year lists</p><p>There’s a lot to love about Beef, the new A24/Netflix show (out Thursday) you’re going to spend the next few weeks hearing about, but one of my favourites is how clearly and surely it looks LA in the eye. We all know the facts: there are only three cities in the world, and those are LA, London and New York. I have never heard of another city in my entire life. And in recent years, TV shows that set themselves in these places (so: 95% of all TV shows) have been knowingly shy about it, as if they are an Oxford undergraduate refusing to admit their dad is rich: <em>yes</em>, these shows say, <em>yes we are in London. But look! We’re not in the posh or obvious bits, alright! Look, here’s Victoria Park! Here’s Larry’s in Peckham! Didn’t expect that, did you?</em></p><p>Beef is not like this. The central, well, beef – down-on-his-luck handyman Steven Yeun and up-on-her-luck-but-unsatisfied-anyway plant artist Ali Wong get into a road rage altercation that overtakes both of their lives (what a pitch!) – is completely of and informed by LA, a city that can only be navigated angrily in a car. On the side of Wong’s Amy, there’s a perfect lampooning of luxe-hippy culture: dinner club mushroom trips, vaping weed cross-legged in a business meeting before perusing a panic room catalogue, big floppy hats and beautiful cardigans, intimacy exercises, thinking your toddler is an artist, extremely expensive chairs.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/01/beef-ali-wong-steven-yeun-netflix-review-joel-golby">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The town infamous for a massacre at hands of Russia has become a symbol of Ukraine’s reconstruction effort, but experts say the influx of money from the west will bring challenges in such a corrupt country</p><p>Standing on the crumbling roof of a house, dozens of workers hammer in unison. Around them, cranes, bulldozers and trucks work frantically to repair roads and buildings destroyed by Russian artillery. It is hard to believe that this noisy construction site is in Yablonska Street, in the town of Bucha, in the north of Kyiv, at the precise crossroads where a year ago the bodies of dozens of civilians, brutally killed by Russian soldiers, were strewn over almost a mile, some with their hands bound behind their backs.</p><p>Ukraine has already repaired, and in many cases fully rebuilt, many of the sites destroyed by Moscow, including bridges, roads and government buildings. It is only the beginning of what Kyiv has described as the largest rebuilding effort since the second world war and perhaps the most expensive in history, with an estimated cost of half a trillion dollars.

<p><strong>Tebay, Cumbria:</strong> In an effort to become more self-sustainable, and to help the landscape of the farm, we are starting a new suckler herd</p><p>After analysing our farm economics in 2020, we sold our Aberdeen Angus suckler herd as they were losing money. With the basic payment scheme falling at that point, we had to take a long hard look at the farm and become more efficient financially. Unfortunately, with the loss of the suckler herd also went the ability to use cows in the landscape as “ecosystem engineers” year-round. We had calves coming and going during the year, but no regular workforce of hardy cattle.</p><p>We had also lost the ability to provide our own beef for our family, so this year I decided to buy some young belted Galloway cattle with a view to building up a small herd. The idea was to become more self-sustainable, provide for our family and sell the excess meat to our neighbours. Besides, my husband had also promised me three hairy cows (hardy native breeds that can survive our climate) as a much-delayed Christmas present, which was cunning of him since he knew I was going to buy them anyway at the Galloway show and sale in Carlisle in March.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/01/country-diary-ringside-at-the-cow-auction">Continue reading...</a>
