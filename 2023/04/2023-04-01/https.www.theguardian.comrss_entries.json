Next up: Anthony Joshua v Jermaine Franklin.</p><p><strong>Hello and welcome to the O2 Arena for tonight\u2019s non-title fight between Anthony Joshua and Jermaine Franklin.</strong> It\u2019s the textbook definition of a crossroads bout for Joshua, the former two-time world champion who is coming off consecutive losses to Oleksandr Usyk. The 2012 Olympic gold medalist desperately needs a career-reviving performance against Franklin, a fringe contender from Saginaw, Michigan, who earned his shot as Joshua\u2019s comeback opponent by giving Dillian Whyte a scare in November.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/apr/01/anthony-joshua-v-jermaine-franklin-world-heavyweight-boxing-live\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/apr/01/anthony-joshua-v-jermaine-franklin-world-heavyweight-boxing-live", "date_published": "2023-04-01 20:54:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "The moment I knew: \u2018I told her my dream was to become an author.

Lacey, one of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/26/granta-list-best-young-american-novelists\">Granta</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/26/granta-list-best-young-american-novelists\">\u2019s best young American novelists in 2017</a>, was speaking from her home in Brooklyn.<br /><br /><strong>Which part of the book came first: the alternate history or the fake biography?</strong><br />I liked the idea of writing a fake biography and the biographies I like best are usually written by someone with some kind of compromised perspective. I thought the worst person to write a biography would be a surviving spouse with a bit of a grudge, but I didn\u2019t want to get into the heterosexual dynamics of a man writing about a woman or a woman writing about a man; it had to be two women. At the same time, I wanted the novel to be set in the mid-20th century but I wasn\u2019t interested in writing about the actual struggles a prominent lesbian couple would have gone through in that time. So my alternate history grew out of that problem. I thought, if I have an America where this female artist could exist and this couple could exist without having to justify themselves, I just need a totally different America.<br /><strong><br />As a workaround, it hardly cut corners.</strong><br />I liked that! I started the novel in 2016 at the same time that I was writing <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/26/pew-by-catherine-lacey-review-when-silence-speaks-volumes\">Pew</a></em>, which takes place in a week and was so spare. I\u2019d decided to make myself write <em>Pew</em> quickly to see what would happen; I found that I can do it, I just prefer not to. <em>Biography of X</em> was more a kind of collecting project that I knew would take longer.</p><p><strong>Where do the various photographs of X come from?</strong><br />A lot of them I found in junk shops; for the images of her books, I commissioned jackets from a book designer.<br /><br /><strong>Why did you include real names from the art and book world?</strong><br />I saw it as another tool to make the novel as much like a biography as possible. There\u2019s a quote [used in the book] from the <em>New Yorker</em> critic <a href=\"https://www.merveemre.com/\">Merve Emre</a> that is actually something she wrote about a Susan Sontag biography. There are a lot of names in there. A lot of them I made up.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/01/catherine-lacey-that-constant-nervous-twitter-energy-repels-me-biography-of-x\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/01/catherine-lacey-that-constant-nervous-twitter-energy-repels-me-biography-of-x", "date_published": "2023-04-01 17:00:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Donald Trump, defiant in the face of indictment \u2013 cartoon", "description": "<p>A grand jury voted to indict the former US president over hush money payments to Stormy Daniels</p><p></p><p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://guardianprintshop.com/collections/chris-riddell-1/products/1st-april-2023\">You can order your own version of this cartoon</a></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/picture/2023/apr/01/donald-trump-defiant-in-the-face-of-indictment-cartoon\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/picture/2023/apr/01/donald-trump-defiant-in-the-face-of-indictment-cartoon", "date_published": "2023-04-01 17:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Female radio station in Afghanistan closed for playing music during Ramadan", "description": "<p>Sadai Banowan violated \u2018laws and regulations of the Islamic Emirate\u2019, says local Taliban official</p><p>A female-run radio station in Afghanistan\u2019s north-east has been shut down for playing music during the holy month of Ramadan, a Taliban official said.</p><p>Sadai Banowan, which means women\u2019s voice in Dari, is Afghanistan\u2019s only female-run station and started 10 years ago.

Grief, we might argue, is more nuanced, an ebb and flow. The dominant force here, annihilating, engulfing, crushing all in sight, is obsession. Two lead singers (the Swiss tenor Rolf Romei and British soprano <a href=\"https://www.allisonoakes.info/\">Allison Oakes</a>), playing lovers of a hallucinatory kind, hurtle and soar above the tidal waves of Korngold\u2019s rich, fortissimo orchestral music.

The ground lost to Borussia Dortmund between 2010 and 2012 was spectacularly recaptured, along with many of the rival club\u2019s best players. The abortive reign of Carlo Ancelotti in 2016 seems to have warned the club hierarchy off the allure of the star foreign manager. And the remarkable chain of events that has reconfigured the landscape of German football over the past fortnight may just have its origins in Bayern\u2019s failed pursuit of a promising young coach called Thomas Tuchel.<br /><br />Tuchel had been on Bayern\u2019s radar as early as 2014, when Pep Guardiola began to recommend the Mainz coach as a potential successor. Cordial meetings were held with the sporting director, Michael Reschke, and the club president, Uli Hoeness. But it was in 2018, when the veteran coach Jupp Heynckes announced his retirement, that the chase really began. Heynckes publicly anointed Tuchel as his chosen successor and talks were arranged. But Bayern were too late. Tuchel had made up his mind to go abroad, and would soon be unveiled as the manager of Paris Saint-Germain.</p><p>If Julian Nagelsmann was unnerved at the prospect of Tuchel returning to the job market, he did a good job of hiding it. As his Bayern squad broke up for the international break after the 2-1 defeat at Bayer Leverkusen, there was little portent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/23/bayern-munich-sack-julian-nagelsmann-and-prepare-to-appoint-thomas-tuchel\">of the approaching chaos</a>. \u201cEveryone come back healthy from the internationals,\u201d Nagelsmann warned his team in what would be their final meeting together. \u201cAnd then we\u2019ll smash Dortmund!\u201d At which point Nagelsmann went skiing in the Austrian Alps with his girlfriend. He would only find out late on the Thursday night via media reports that his job had been given to Tuchel.<br /><br />It seemed logical enough, even if the shock value at the time was real. Beat Dortmund at the Allianz Arena this Saturday \u2013 as they have done in each of their last eight meetings at home \u2013 and Bayern will return to the top of the Bundesliga, presumptive favourites to win their 11th title in a row. This season\u2019s Champions League <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/08/bayern-munich-psg-champions-league-last-16-match-report\">has produced eight wins out of eight</a>. But then raw numbers have never kept any Bayern manager safe. This is a club where coaches are hired and fired largely on feel and projection, the vague but compelling idea that some basic essence has been lost. \u201cThis is not what Bayern stands for,\u201d the current sporting director, Hasan Salihamidzic, said scornfully after the defeat to Leverkusen, and in retrospect this was the point at which we should have realised that change was coming.<br /><br />And something <em>has</em> undoubtedly been slightly off at Bayern this season, even if it is hard to pin down exactly what. There were few signs of dressing-room disaffection, and indeed over the international window many Bayern players expressed their surprise at Nagelsmann\u2019s sacking. Certainly results since the World Cup have been substandard, allowing a surging Dortmund to go top for the first time in almost four years. Eleven points dropped from winning positions hints at a certain brittleness and an occasional tendency to concede soft goals. But there is nothing like a smoking gun here.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/01/thomas-tuchel-julian-nagelsmann-bayern-munich-borussia-dortmund\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/01/thomas-tuchel-julian-nagelsmann-bayern-munich-borussia-dortmund", "date_published": "2023-04-01 07:00:46+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Amid the Prince Harry circus lies a court battle with the highest stakes", "description": "<p>The Daily Mail\u2019s owner, the prince and Elton John could be on the road to one of the biggest media trials in British history</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/28/why-is-prince-harry-bringing-legal-action-against-daily-mail-owner-associated-newspapers\">Why is Prince Harry bringing legal action against Daily Mail owner?</a></li></ul><p>When the Duke of Sussex unexpectedly arrived at the high court on Monday morning he became the most senior royal to appear in a courtroom since Princess Anne <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/nov/21/monarchy\">admitted</a> being in charge of an English bull terrier that was dangerously out of control in a public space.</p><p>Prince Harry was there to allege that Associated Newspapers, the parent company of the Daily Mail, was similarly out of control.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/01/amid-the-prince-harry-circus-lies-a-court-battle-with-the-highest-stakes\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/01/amid-the-prince-harry-circus-lies-a-court-battle-with-the-highest-stakes", "date_published": "2023-04-01 07:00:45+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "How 149 seconds of grainy footage made the case for Michael Vaughan", "description": "<p>Over four days in a stuffy Fleet Street room, two and a half minutes of video was spliced and diced</p><p>Anyone with a passing interest in the assassination of John F Kennedy knows about the Zapruder film, the silent 8mm sequence shot by Abraham Zapruder as the president\u2019s car drove through Dallas on a fateful day in November 1963.
