One is that we should finally take school safety seriously with armed resource officers, and protect our children the same way we protect our money, celebrities, and politicians. The other is we do nothing other than politicize guns <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/feeds/%22If%20she%20shot%20her%20way%20in%20to%20that%20school%20from%20the%20outside,%20my%20guard,%20who%20is%20tucked%20away,%20armed%20and%20unseen,%20would%20have%20seen%20her%20and%20taken%20her%20down.%20Saving%20those%20children%E2%80%99s%20lives.%20May%20God%20and%20his%20best%20people%20on%20this%20earth%20protect%20our%20children!%22" target="_blank">and try to humanize the shooter</a>. Count Conor McGregor in the former group.</p><p>He thinks YOUR kids should be as safe as his. Conor tweeted how he provides his kid's school with armed protection and wants the same for everyone's school.</p><blockquote>If [the Nashville shooter] shot her way in to that school from the outside, my guard, who is tucked away, armed and unseen, would have seen her and taken her down. Saving those children’s lives. May God and his best people on this earth protect our children!</blockquote><p>To validate Conor's belief, the Nashville shooter HAD another location in mind. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nashville-target-school-security" target="_blank">Covenant School was chosen because of the lack of security</a>. </p><p>McGregor has since deleted the tweet. I'm assuming it's because he thought better of declaring he has an armed guard outside of his kid's school. And NOT because he has changed his mind on this issue.</p><p>Conor's feeling echoes that of Fox News's Tyrus, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/school-shooting-veterans-solution" target="_blank">who has been calling for this since 2018</a>.</p><blockquote><em>4.3 unemployment for returning veterans in this country. That's 430,000 trained men who have eyes and ears. We need to have them at the schools. TSA needs to be at the schools. One way in. One way out. There's not one person in this building who not be ok with upping theirs taxes $25. I would even take money away from other things. Because we need to get with it. Because now it's guys with guns. Ten years from now it's going to be a guy with a drone.</em></blockquote><p>Our kids should be AS SAFE as the kids of the politicians and celebrities who appear more concerned about disarming people (other than their security) and leaving OUR kids as easy targets. Things need to change.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## A Pro-Trump influencer got  convicted of "election interference"  for creating a meme and it should terrify you

We have officially reached the point in America where citizens are being arrested for meme-making. </p><p>Douglass Mackey was found guilty by a New York court on charges of election interference yesterday. In 2016, Mackey jokingly posted a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/cnn-elon-musk" target="_blank">meme</a> encouraging Democrats to vote for <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/hillary-clinton-poop" target="_blank">Hillary Clinton</a> by text. Which is obviously <em>not real. </em></p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cThis is the meme that Douglas Mackey is going to prison for. What a disgrace our justice system has become.\u201d</div> — Joel Berry (@Joel Berry)

</blockquote>

<p>The DOJ claimed this constituted election interference, even though they can't prove anyone was actually fooled by the meme. The phone number led to a real line, and some users didn't "immediately receive error messages," <a href="https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/right-wing-twitter-troll-convicted-of-interfering-in-2016-election-through-deceptive-vote-by-text-meme/" target="_blank">according to Law and Crime.</a> </p><p>Mackey claimed he was just trying to make a viral meme and that several Hillary Clinton supporters had made similar jokes without getting prosecuted. But the prosecution argued Mackey worked with other meme makers in some type of conspiracy to make the memes as real as possible and "vaporize votes". </p><p>The Eastern District of New York’s U.S. Attorney Breon Peace said in a statement, "Mackey has been found guilty by a jury of his peers of attempting to deprive individuals from exercising their sacred right to vote for the candidate of their choice in the 2016 Presidential Election. Today’s verdict proves that the defendant’s fraudulent actions crossed a line into criminality and flatly rejects his cynical attempt to use the constitutional right of free speech as a shield for his scheme to subvert the ballot box and suppress the vote.”</p><p>It was a JOKE. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cTucker Carlson on the Douglass Mackey trial:\n\n"Hillary Clinton apparently is OK with sending a man to prison for 10 years for making fun of her. If you ever wondered whether she's a cruel and horrible person, the answer is yes she is."\u201d</div> — The Post Millennial (@The Post Millennial)
        <a href="https://twitter.com/TPostMillennial/status/1641967508256178180">1680310534</a>
</blockquote>

<p>Many Twitter users have since pointed out that this chick Kristina Wong did the exact same thing but, for Donald Trump voters. As far as we can tell, no charges have been brought against her. </p><p>Wong tweeted, "Hey Trump Supporters! Skip poll lines at Election 2016 and TEXT in your vote! Text votes are legit. Or vote tomorrow on Super Wednesday!" </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cDouglass Mackey was convicted for posting a joke meme about Hillary Clinton. He is facing ten years in prison. Kristina Wong @mskristinawong posted the same joke meme about Donald Trump. She is running for office and is facing no time in prison.

<p>Plus, these charges against Mackey weren't brought until after Joe Biden's inauguration - over four years after the meme in question was made. And now he faces a 10-year prison sentence. For a <em>meme</em>. He reportedly plans to <a href="https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/1641934725525696514?s=20" target="_blank">appeal</a> the decision, so here's to hoping it gets overturned. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Teen gets kicked out of Pokemon tournament after laughing about declaring - his OWN - preferred pronouns

Yet, it's 2023 and here we are. A teenage Pokemon card athlete got DISQUALIFIED for laughing at preferred pronouns. His own preferred pronouns.</p><p>Our story takes place in -- *deep breath* -- NORTH CAR-O-LI-NA!</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Charlotte regionals disqualification<br /><br />Read: <a href="https://t.co/83F7zvuWMJ">https://t.co/83F7zvuWMJ</a><br />— takani mran (@FishNugget4) <a href="https://twitter.com/FishNugget4/status/1640195979595898884?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 27, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Makani Tran, who plays the Pokémon Trading Card Game at <a href="https://komonews.com/news/nation-world/teen-who-laughed-when-asked-for-preferred-pronouns-booted-from-pokmon-card-tournament-trading-card-game-makani-tran-charlotte" target="_blank">a high competitive level</a>, was asked for his pronouns by a judge. As you can imagine, if you aren't about that pronoun life, having someone ask you that question can be a little off-putting. Kinda in a "wow, you people exist IRL off of the internet" way. Makani, who as it turns out is a he/him, laughed nervously because he couldn't think of the third.</p><blockquote>As I just stood there looking stupid trying to think of the third pronoun I felt embarrassed because I was failing to think of a simple word. Due to the nerves and me being embarrassed I let out a little laugh just a normal nervous laugh. My response together ended up being 'Um he or him or uhhhh haha his. That’s it. That’s all I said.</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="45ec2" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33393758&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>The rub is the judge was a they/them. And Makani's innocent laughter caused they/them to get sand in they/their crack.</p><blockquote>The judge looked at me and said “okay just wanted to check to be safe. I go by they/them so don’t be a jerk about it.” They smiled after this and gave no signs whatsoever of being upset or uncomfortable. When they said “don’t be a jerk about it” I thought they were just saying in general like in the future or something.</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" id="8e090" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33393835&amp;width=980" />
</p><p>Nope. Judge They/Them complained. The Head Judge (pronouns unclear) whipped out the rulebook and said Makani violated Pokemon's, quote, "inclusive policy." Makani had made someone feel "unsafe and uncomfortable" and could no longer compete in the competition. He also got yeeted out of the venue. There may have been <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/frog-pronouns-gop" target="_blank">a frog/frogself there</a>, and tournament organizers wanted to err on the side of caution.</p><blockquote>I was disqualified from the event. I was just in disbelief. I remember saying 'Wait what?' I was so confused I had just explained very calmly what had happened and he seemed that he was listening. At this point I’m at the verge of tears but I tried my best to keep my composure,. I just couldn’t understand what was happening.</blockquote><p>You made an innocent mistake in front of a bitchy they/them. That's what happened, dude/dudeself. No doubt, a they/them who went to TikTok to cry about how they were misgendered by a he/him, so they got someone disqualified to teach he/him/his a lesson. I'd look for the existence of the video myself. But it's easier just to give @LibsofTikTok a few days.</p><p>Sadly, I think Makani is going to learn the wrong lesson. It won't be that people who declare their own pronouns <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/grammar-lesson-british-dude" target="_blank">want to control how YOU think</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/pronouns-resume-employer" target="_blank">cause problems in the real world</a>. It will be that he has to try harder to be respectful of people who aren't respectful of him. You know, in the name of equity and stuff.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Watch: Conservative gets violently assaulted by trans activists as police watch, make no arrests

He was apparently assaulted a whopping three times, though so far, there's only footage of two of the incidents. The first time occurred when one of the activists tried to grab his phone, presumably to keep him from filming. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>

<p>He was then assaulted a second time while giving an interview to Dan Dicks of Press For Truth. He noted that this assault was more serious, as he was surrounded on all sides, and a biological male got inches from his face. When Chris tried to push this person away from his face, the person lunged for his neck. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cAssault #2. This was a more serious one.

<p>If you notice, police are standing in the background and did nothing to de-escalate the situation. Dan Dicks showed them the footage of the assault after it took place and they claimed Chris incited the attack. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Dicks asks the police officers, "Did you just say he came here to incited violence by forcing his opinion on people?" And they replied, "yes."</p><p>Dicks pressed them, "You think he came here to incite violence because they got offended by his sign?" One of the officers said, "When you talk to someone, and scream at someone..." Dicks then pointed out that the activists were the ones who surrounded Chris and got in <em>his</em> face, but she was not having it. </p><p>A Twitter sleuth noticed one of the officers appeared to be smiling and enjoying Chris's assault:</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201c@BillboardChris I noticed something VERY interesting about THIS specific officer just prior to, during, and after your assault. I thought your attorneys and her superiors might be interested in seeing it as well.  Notice the joy and excitement on her face as this is going down.

<p>These events seem to be getting increasingly dangerous, even if all you do is wear a sign. And Chris alluded to a potential lawsuit of the Vancouver Police Department, which would be interesting to see play out. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Bill Maher warns his fellow Dems what the new norms of indicting Trump really mean: "GOP will arrest Biden next"

Not when <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nancy-pelosi-trump-prove-innocence" target="_blank">the staffers who prop up Nancy Pelosi</a> don't <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nancy-pelosi-trump-prove-innocence" target="_blank">understand basic civics</a>. So while a lot of what Maher says about the Trump indictment is correct, the left has their fingers in their ears screaming, "I can't hear you."</p><p>Maher attempted to warn Democrats of the chaos they're unleashing <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/bill-maher-fears-trump-indictment-spark-cycle-revenge-future-presidents" target="_blank">last night on <em>Real Time</em></a>.</p><blockquote>I don't want to live in a country where we are one of these places where whoever is president, as soon as they get out of office, they go after them. It's almost Greek tragedy-like. [...] And I guarantee you when Biden is out of office, Day Two, they will try to arrest him.</blockquote><p>Yep. It harkens back to when Harry Reid blew up the norms in the senate and eliminated the filibuster. Cocaine Mitch warned Democrats they weren't going to like the consequences. Three conservative Supreme Court justices and a farewell to Roe v Wade later ... they don't.</p><p>Democrats turned Donald Trump into the first former president to be indicted ... over a bullplop reason. Trump (allegedly) cheated on his third wife while she was pregnant with a porn star. He then (allegedly) paid the porn star to keep her mouth shut. At best, it's a misdemeanor, a slap on the wrist, and a fine. </p><p>Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg -- <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/trump-arrest-show-notes" target="_blank">who not only has a reputation for not enforcing the law against repeat and violent offenders, but brags (no pun intended) about doing so</a> -- concocted a cockamamie legal theory to turn a misdemeanor into a felony just so HE could be the one to finally indict Trump.</p><p>This brings us to Maher's second problem.</p><blockquote>Yes, he's done a lot of bad things, and I'm sure he did this — everything they accused him of [doing], he did. But first of all, it's not gonna work. It's gonna be rocket fuel for his 2024 campaign. And it's just gonna look to MAGA nation like, 'Oh, you know, you tried with Mueller, you tried with Ukraine, you tried with January 6. Now we go to the porn star? Really? You're down to that?!</blockquote><p>If I had a little more tinfoil to form into a beanie, I'd say this is part of a plan. Democrats WANT Trump to get the nomination because they know he's beatable and is toxic to independent voters. But why assign malice where incompetence will due? Democrats are simply clueless. Hoisted with their own petard to get Trump on ANYTHING. And the best they can come up with is this petarded indictment.</p><p>That's fine. It's the new norm now. Having your political opponents arrested are a component of the new rules. New rules I'm going to look forward to having under a Republican administration. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
