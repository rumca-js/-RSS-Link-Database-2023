  <p id="j6v8p2">Ah. April Fools’ Day. The dreaded day when publishers like <em>The Verge </em>have to second guess every news story or potential tip that lands in our Gmail inbox. Thankfully, when it comes to deals, things are often exactly what they appear to be. Take today’s discount on <strong>Apple’s sixth-gen iPad Mini</strong>, which is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G91LXFP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">currently matching its all-time low of $399.99</a> ($100 off) at Amazon in the 64GB configuration with Wi-Fi.</p>

  <p id="MO5ui1">I’m starting this with a personal story. My mother was a New York City public school teacher for many years. When she joined the school system, part of the deal was that, when she retired, many of the costs of her traditional Medicare plans would be subsidized by her union and by the city. So far, so good. However, now the city, in order to save money, is moving all its retirees, including the public school teachers, <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-retirees-must-switch-new-medicare-coverage-after-union-leaders-favor-aetna-privatized-plan">to a Medicare Advantage plan</a>. </p>
<p id="xZh9To"></p>
<p id="ZFH2Ik">(If you don’t know what Medicare is, or the difference between traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage, don’t worry about it — a lot of people don’t. I’ll explain in a moment.)</p>

  <p id="frGXo8">This weekend is an important one for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/28/23045328/valorant-professional-esports-leagues-2023"><em>Valorant</em> esports</a>, with the launch of a new professional league for teams across North America, Latin America, and Brazil. The debut of the VCT Americas league, as it’s known, will also mark the first time <em>Valorant</em> games have taken place live and in person in North America. That meant that Riot had to redesign its Los Angeles studio to be much more high tech and flexible to accommodate the league, which shares the space with<em> League of Legends</em> — the new esports arena can even transform.</p>
<p id="dMENwH">The space is formerly known as the LCS Arena, and for years has been home to the top <em>League of Legends</em> league in North America (the LCS). As part of the redesign, the studio space has been christened Riot Games Arena. In...</p>

  <p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="qpIIpK">A couple of weeks ago, Nilay wrote about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23642073/best-printer-2023-brother-laser-wi-fi-its-fine">the Brother laser printer</a> everyone else has. It’s cheap, reliable, and the toner lasts a long time. Get a Brother laser printer, he said, and basically never think about your printer again.
