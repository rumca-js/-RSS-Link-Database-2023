If you were confused about the exact nature of the game and who it even might be for based on early trailers, you definitely aren\u2019t alone.\n\nCrime Boss: Rockay City\u2019s heist gameplay is squandered by a myriad of bugs, mindless, boring gameplay, and a severe lack of fun despite its best attempts to have the presence of GTA and the mechanics of Payday, both of which are much better games.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guEEy81UdZs", "date_published": "2023-04-01 19:30:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "The Full Story of Cere Junda - Before You Play Star Wars: Jedi Survivor", "description": "Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order was, first and foremost, the story of Cal Kestis, and though its upcoming sequel will obviously still continue to focus on the former Padawan in hiding turned Jedi Knight and his buddy droid BD-1, his companions and the crew of the Stinger Mantis will once again play a crucial role in the story as well. \n\nOne character in particular that is arguably as crucial to the story that the developer is telling is Cere Junda, Cal's mentor, and it goes without saying that she is once again going to continue to grab a fair bit of the spotlight. Ahead of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor's imminent launch, here, we're going to zoom in on her and her story and go through all of it to prepare for what lies ahead for her.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7AvlTcWTaU", "date_published": "2023-04-01 15:30:18+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Resident Evil 5 - TO REMAKE OR NOT TO REMAKE?", "description": "The question of whether Resident Evil 5 deserves a remake is a different one \u2013 and to be honest, the answer is a resounding yes.
