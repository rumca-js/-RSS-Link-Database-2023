On Friday, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, in a decision spotted by <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-broke-law-with-tweet-about-tesla-stock-options-court-rules-2023-4\"><em><ins>Business Insider</ins></em></a>, upheld a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-ordered-to-delete-tweet-from-2018-111132733.html\">National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) ruling</a> that found Musk made unlawful threats around employee compensation.</p><p>In May 2018, a Twitter user asked Musk about his stance on unions. \u201cNothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union.

Tesla has argued the tweet was Musk\u2019s way of pointing out that workers at other automakers don\u2019t receive stock options. NLRB chair Wilma Liebman saw it differently. &quot;The employee is going to hear it as, 'If I vote to unionize, stock options will no longer be an option,'&quot; she <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/musk-stock-option-tweet-violated-u-s-labor-law-uaw-alleges\"><ins>told </ins><em><ins>Bloomberg </ins></em><ins>in 2018</ins></a>.</p><p>After reviewing the decision, the Fifth Circuit Court sided with the NLRB. &quot;Because stock options are part of Tesla's employees' compensation, and nothing in the tweet suggested that Tesla would be forced to end stock options or that the UAW would be the cause of giving up stock options, substantial evidence supports the NLRB's conclusion that the tweet is as an implied threat to end stock options as retaliation for unionization,&quot; the panel <a href=\"https://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/21/21-60285-CV0.pdf\"><ins>wrote</ins></a>.</p><p>The court ordered Musk to delete the tweet. As of the writing of this article, the message is still live. The Fifth Circuit Court also upheld an order from the NLRB that Tesla reinstates Richard Ortiz, a worker the automaker fired for organizing employees at its Fremont factory in California.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/court-rules-elon-musk-broke-federal-labor-law-with-2018-tweet-195420903.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/court-rules-elon-musk-broke-federal-labor-law-with-2018-tweet-195420903.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-01 19:54:20+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Apple\u2019s MacBook Air M2 is on sale for $1,000 right now", "description": "<p>If you\u2019re in the market for a new ultraportable laptop, one of the best you can buy is on sale right now.

Since then, the ultraportable has sat atop our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-laptops-120008636.html\"><ins>best laptops list</ins></a>, and for good reason. The M2 Air offers a compelling mix of performance, portability and ease of use. It also has a lovely 13.6-inch display and a powerful set of four speakers. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s possible to regularly get more than 16 hours of battery life out of the Air. Many will also appreciate that it only weighs 2.7 pounds and is less than 12 millimeters thick. Outside of a web camera that could be better and a modest 256GB of storage on the base model, there\u2019s very little about the M2 Air that\u2019s not compelling.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter and </em><a href=\"https://subscription.yahoo.net/Newsletter/Preference/sub?b=engadgetdeals&amp;src\"><em>subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter</em></a><em> for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apples-macbook-air-m2-is-on-sale-for-1000-right-now-171756338.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/apples-macbook-air-m2-is-on-sale-for-1000-right-now-171756338.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-01 17:17:56+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Apple wins appeal against UK antitrust probe into mobile browser dominance", "description": "<p>Apple has handed the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority a major setback in its effort to regulate the tech giant.
