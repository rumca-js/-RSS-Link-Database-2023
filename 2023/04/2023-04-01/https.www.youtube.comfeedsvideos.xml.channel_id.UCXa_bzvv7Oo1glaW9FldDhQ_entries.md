Crime Boss: Rockay City is a strange yet appropriately titled first-person shooter that is filled to the brim with de-aged versions of movie stars from days long past, and features a few different types of gameplay mechanics. If you were confused about the exact nature of the game and who it even might be for based on early trailers, you definitely aren’t alone.

Crime Boss: Rockay City’s heist gameplay is squandered by a myriad of bugs, mindless, boring gameplay, and a severe lack of fun despite its best attempts to have the presence of GTA and the mechanics of Payday, both of which are much better games.

Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order was, first and foremost, the story of Cal Kestis, and though its upcoming sequel will obviously still continue to focus on the former Padawan in hiding turned Jedi Knight and his buddy droid BD-1, his companions and the crew of the Stinger Mantis will once again play a crucial role in the story as well. 

One character in particular that is arguably as crucial to the story that the developer is telling is Cere Junda, Cal's mentor, and it goes without saying that she is once again going to continue to grab a fair bit of the spotlight. Ahead of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor's imminent launch, here, we're going to zoom in on her and her story and go through all of it to prepare for what lies ahead for her.

The question of whether Resident Evil 5 deserves a remake is a different one – and to be honest, the answer is a resounding yes. There’s enough potential here to evolve an already decent experience into something truly memorable. 

The remake should stick with the aspects which make Resident Evil 5 unique – that is, it’s action-heavy gunplay in searing daylight sections – there’s no reason a RE5 remake can’t be a success.
