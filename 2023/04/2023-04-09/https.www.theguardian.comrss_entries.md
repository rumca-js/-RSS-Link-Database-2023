## Why Didn’t They Ask Evans? review – a classic whodunnit with delight in every scene

<p>Written and directed by Hugh Laurie, this adaptation of Agatha Christie’s coastal mystery has it all: tight dialogue, a starry cast and exquisite 1930s nostalgia</p><p>The first of many good jokes in Why Didn’t They Ask Evans? (the first of a three-parter airing on consecutive nights) is a scuffed tee shot. A few lines of beautifully economical dialogue establish that the golfer in question, playing with the sea behind him on a gorgeous Welsh links course, regularly disdains the wise counsel of his younger, fitter caddie, to the gentle amusement of them both. After he has insisted on using his driver (“Are you sure, sir?”), the way the ball grubs pathetically along the ground is just right. Everything in this three-part period whodunnit – originally shown last year on BritBox – is just right.</p><p>But the golf round is soon interrupted by a cry from the bottom of the nearby cliff. The caddie, Bobby (Will Poulter), scrambles down and finds a man, broken and dying, who utters the phrase that gives the story its title before his eyes become finally glassy and still. Bobby checks the corpse for clues, coming across a photograph of a beautiful but distressed woman, and is then joined (rather suddenly, given the remoteness of this part of the shore) by a friendly chap named Roger Bassington-ffrench (Daniel Ings) – “Two small Fs, don’t ask me what they stand for”. He offers to wait with the body until the police arrive, but is not seen again afterwards.</p><p>The first episode of Why Didn’t They Ask Evans? aired on ITV and is now available on ITVX. Episodes two and three will be available on ITVX on Sunday, and air on Monday and Tuesday.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/09/why-didnt-they-ask-evans-review-agatha-christie-hugh-lauriea-classic-whodunnit-with-delight-in-every-scene">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The post-match scene of Arsenal devastation said it all. Gabriel Magalhães sank to his knees, Oleksandr Zinchenko held his head in his hands and Mikel Arteta took on the role of counsellor-in-chief as he sought to raise his players physically and emotionally. Arsenal’s sequence of damaging defeats at Liverpool is over, but Manchester City have renewed hope in the title race.</p><p>Arsenal were 2-0 up and commanding proceedings after 28 minutes. They let their advantage, at Anfield and over City, slip as Mohamed Salah pulled a goal back before half-time and then missed a second half penalty before Roberto Firmino came off the bench to level in the 87th minute. From an eight point lead with eight matches to play to a six point lead with a trip to the Etihad Stadium to come, Arsenal’s post-match frustration was as justified as it was telling. Aaron Ramsdale was outstanding in the face of a second half Liverpool onslaught but a point does little for either the title aspirations of the visitors nor the Champions League qualification hopes of the hosts.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/09/liverpool-arsenal-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Churches with African and Caribbean roots are thriving despite the secular times</p><p>Easter is the great Christian festival of hope and rebirth. But Britain’s churches have few reasons to be cheerful about their own future. The 2021 census results, published in November, found that for the first time less than half the population identifies as Christian. Thousands of churches have <a href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2022/may/uk-england-church-close-anglican-buildings-restore-new.html" title="">closed</a> their doors in recent years, some repurposed into art galleries or museums.</p><p>In the midst of decline, however, a religious success story is changing the shape and enriching the texture of British Christianity. To a remarkable degree, black majority churches (BMCs) are a countercultural growth industry in a country which is perhaps less secular than it believes itself to be. Research <a href="https://faithsurvey.co.uk/download/gb-church-attendance-1980-2015.pdf" title="">suggests</a> that the rise in non-white church attendance in recent decades may more or less match the drop-off in white churchgoers. Though predominantly Pentecostal, BMCs also exist within the Anglican communion and other historic church traditions, the Baptist Union and Methodism. In London and Britain’s other major cities, former bingo halls, warehouses and shops have been transformed into places of worship, channelling the evangelical intensity of African and Caribbean Christianity.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/09/the-guardian-view-on-black-british-christians-keeping-the-faith">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Readers in Finland respond to an article by Zoe Williams and reflect on the reasons why Sanna Marin lost the election</p><p>As a Guardian reader and supporter and a follower of Finnish politics for more than 20 years, I was saddened to read Zoe Williams’ misrepresentations of the Finnish parliamentary election result (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/04/misogyny-finland-sanna-marin" title="">Misogyny is a mighty force on the right – just look at the fate of Finland’s Sanna Marin, 4 April</a>).</p><p>Ms Marin was correct to celebrate the electoral process in her concession speech. It was an election campaign fought in a very civilised manner on issues (public spending, the environment and immigration), not personalities. The sharing on social media of some party moments may be fresh in British commentators’ minds, but is already history for most people here.

<p>It must open a debate about the issue of publicly generated money, writes <strong>Prof</strong> <strong>Mary Mellor</strong>; plus letters from <strong>Joy Webb, John Hully</strong> and <strong>Kev Crocombe</strong></p><p>Labour is failing to promote core Labour values such as equality and welfare (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/04/the-guardian-view-on-sir-keir-starmer-his-party-remains-a-mystery-to-voters" title="">The Guardian view on Sir Keir Starmer: his party remains a mystery to voters, 4 April</a>) because it is still wedded to the “handbag economics” of neoliberals such as the late Nigel Lawson. The view of the state as like a household, constrained by a shortage of money, bears no relation to the public monetary largesse of 21st-century states. Since the 1990s deflation crisis in Japan, the financial crisis of 2007-08 and the pandemic, central banks in key economies have been in full flow. However, this has mainly supported the financial sector and the market generally, rather than public welfare.</p><p>To open up this new agenda, fundamental questions need to be asked about the creation and circulation of money in the 21st<sup> </sup>century. Why is publicly generated money (QE) used to bolster the (financial) market rather than public services? Why can banks borrow from the central bank, when governments have to borrow from private finance? Why is that government debt, when bought back by the central bank using publicly generated QE, not then cancelled?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/apr/09/how-labour-can-make-clear-its-for-the-many-not-the-few-to-coin-a-phrase">Continue reading...</a>

He executes it almost perfectly. The ball lands like a feather, turns 90 degrees right, and then, thanks to the camber on the other side of the green acting as a backstop, rolls back into the heart of the green, stopping 12 feet from the flag. The best he could do. On Sky, Ewen Murray points out that Seve would have been 66 today, and he’d have doffed his cap to that one. Rahm rolls in the putt, one of the great up and downs on this famous hole. That’s a staunch save, because Koepka chips and putts with minimal fuss. The pair walk off with their pars, Rahm the happier having made three big putts in a row. Koepka must be wondering what he has to do to shake this guy off.</p><p><strong>Brooks doesn’t take care of business on 9.</strong> He’s in the middle of the fairway, having watched Rahm send his tee shot onto pine needles down the right, then hit a mud ball into the bunker to the left of the green. But though he lands his approach on the green pin high, there’s too much backspin on his ball, which tumbles back down the false front and onto the fairway. An up-and-down contest coming up.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/apr/09/the-masters-2023-third-fourth-round-golf-koepka-rahm-live-updates">Continue reading...</a>

Production designer who helped create the look of the Star Wars films and of the Indiana Jones adventure Raiders of the Lost Ark<p>The production designer and art director Norman Reynolds, who has died aged 89, concealed a career in Hollywood blockbusters by telling people he made biscuits for a living. In fact, he played an integral role in bringing to fruition two of the most successful franchises in cinema history. As art director in a team that also included the production designer John Barry, his fellow art director Leslie Dilley and the set decorator Roger Christian, Reynolds helped create the Oscar-winning look of the original Star Wars (1977), which was simultaneously spectacular and lived-in. The impression it gave was of a future that had seen better days.</p><p>Hired just before Christmas 1975, Reynolds started work only tentatively until the studio gave the green light to this risky project a few months later. Like everyone involved in the movie, he was often asked whether he had any inkling that it was going to change cinema forever. “Most of us, if I’m brutally frank, were just glad to be working,” he said in 2016. “Nobody had any idea that it was going to be the success that it is.” The realisation began to dawn on him as he watched the director George Lucas shooting the robots C-3PO and R2-D2 as they trundled through the desert in Tunisia. “I thought, ‘This is special. This could be something extraordinary.’”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/09/norman-reynolds-obituary-star-wars">Continue reading...</a>

Member of the chart-topping pop band S Club 7 who enjoyed great success in the early 2000s<p>Paul Cattermole, who has died aged 46, was part of the chart-topping pop band S Club 7 from its formation in 1998 until he quit in 2002, making his last appearance with them at the Queen’s Golden Jubilee concert that June. His departure from the septet prompted them to be renamed S Club.</p><p>The group had become one of the most successful acts of their era, notching up 11 Top 5 singles in the UK and scoring a US Top 10 hit with the lachrymose ballad <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB9_sf6oV1o" title="">Never Had a Dream Come True</a>. Their debut single, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLQ0biK-ZgA" title="">Bring It All Back</a>, strongly reminiscent of the Jackson 5, was the first of their four UK chart-toppers. Their debut album, S Club, reached No 2, the follow-up 7 (2000) reached No 1, and the third, Sunshine (2001), went to No 3. The first three albums all achieved multi-platinum sales, though sales fell away for Seeing Double, which did not feature Cattermole. The group won best British breakthrough act at the Brit awards in 2000, and the best British single trophy in 2002 for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm262cXxRrU" title="">Don’t Stop Movin’</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/09/paul-cattermole-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

As they fired Nerf guns in a battle against each other, stopping every so often to prevent the puppy from eating the bullets, I sat on the couch trying to maintain feelings of Zen by reading shopping catalogues.

<p>Research tells us living near our loved ones makes us happier and strengthens our relationships. But is that possible, and how can we be better friends if not?</p><p>I had a little spasm of unease recently, listening to Elizabeth Day talking on the radio about her new book <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/06/friendaholic-by-elizabeth-day-review-friends-with-benefits">Friendaholic</a> and the problems that having too many friends has caused her.

Five intimate friendships is the optimal amount – I scrape two – and Dunbar posited that we can maintain a network of 150 people close enough that it wouldn’t be awkward to have a drink with them. That’s <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20191001-dunbars-number-why-we-can-only-maintain-150-relationships#:~:text=According%20to%20British%20anthropologist%20Robin,studies%20of%20non%2Dhuman%20primates">Dunbar’s number</a>: 150! I’d have to include everyone who walks their dog on my route, my whole pilates class and half the street to get there, and not knowing most of their names would surely push it over the awkwardness barrier. I mean, I can be awkward with my two intimate friends on bad days.</p><p>It’s easy to feel inadequate about friendships, and I haven’t, historically, been a good friend. I don’t mean I steal boyfriends or betray confidences, but I’m chaotic, bad at prioritising and time slips through my fingers like water. I lived for a long time in a transient city – Brussels – where friendships seemed to be easily formed then easily forgotten and it gave me bad habits, I think, which make me seem thoughtless and careless.

<p>When Rachael Lennon was planning her wedding, she began to question the institution of marriage – was it really for her? Yet in researching it, she discovered wedlock is whatever you choose to make it</p><p>Rachael Lennon married her wife in a medieval hall in Northumberland four years after same-sex marriages became legal. It was a June day in 2017, and it rained until just before 2pm, when the wedding began. But hadn’t it really begun, in a way, when her parents got married, or her grandmother, or in 1840, when Victoria’s white wedding to Albert defined a “traditional” wedding in the West for decades to follow, or six years earlier when Anne Lister and Ann Walker <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jul/28/anne-lister-blue-plaque-lesbian-marriage-church" title="">married</a> through taking communion together, or in the Middle Ages, when the Christian church first monopolised what a marriage should be? Lennon’s wedding, as all weddings are, came loaded with romance, tradition, expectations of transformation and the weight of centuries of history.</p><p>In 2002, a counsellor from <a href="https://www.relate.org.uk/" title="">Relate</a> told the <em>Daily Mail </em>that marriage would “be extinct in 30 years”. The clock is ticking. Except – anti-marriage crusades have stretched from second-century north Africa to 20th-century Israel, and all of them have failed. The bells still ring: in the UK, around half a million people get married every year. Despite the fact that more than 40% of weddings will end in divorce, most people still choose to marry at some point in their lives. But the institution itself has expanded and contracted and reshaped itself so much over the years that a marriage often means different things to different people – sometimes even those living in the same house.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/09/marriage-is-more-diverse-than-people-think-a-historian-view-of-tying-the-knot">Continue reading...</a>

But, at its heart, g<em>al-dem</em> was much more than an insightful resource; it was a thriving network of writers that banded together to carve out space for themselves in <a href="https://www.nctj.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Diversity-in-journalism-2022.pdf" title="">a largely white male-dominated industry.</a></p><p>So, when <em><a href="https://twitter.com/galdemzine/status/1641776359302127616?s=20" title="">gal-dem</a></em><a href="https://twitter.com/galdemzine/status/1641776359302127616?s=20" title=""> announced its closure</a> last week, writers across the industry felt the gaping hole that would be left behind. In a goodbye <a href="https://gal-dem.com/gal-dem-goodbye-letter/" title="">statement published on their site</a>, the <em>gal-dem</em> team noted the difficulties of keeping an “independent media company that is reliant on partnerships afloat over the last three years”. As layoffs have rippled through the industry, the pressures of a global pandemic, budget reductions and an economic downturn proved too much for a small publication to fight against.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/apr/09/farewell-gal-dem-you-were-disruptive-joyful-and-you-gave-us-a-voice">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Nutty chocolate and crisp praline sweet treats for Easter</p><p>I like smashing an Easter egg – that crisp snap as the wafer-thin chocolate shatters into pointed shards when you break it. Chocolate so crisp you can hear it crack. I have made chocolate eggs in a previous life and a right fuss it was to get them out of their moulds without breaking them.</p><p>At Easter, I now prefer to melt the chocolate, pour it over baking parchment and let it set into the thinnest possible sheets. Before it does, I scatter the surface with a dust of glistening praline, crumbled crystallised roses or violets and candied yuzu or orange peel, which works so well with darker chocolate. Roasted almonds or hazelnuts are on my list, too.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/09/nigel-slater-recipes-chocolate-mascarpone-cake-and-chocolate-praline-wafers">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The immigration minister has allowed me to see things more clearly after a bout of post-Covid brain fog</p><p>Last time I wrote one of these pieces our riverbanks weren’t garlanded with bog roll. The Home Office wasn’t breaking its own rules – and other people’s – and describing our situation wasn’t <em>talking the country down.</em> I did notice our sharknado of calamity, but was distracted by catching Covid before the vaccine. My post-viral thyroid gland began gleefully destabilising what had been a perfectly acceptable normality. I called it Nigel – after Farage. I spent 18 months being so sleeplessly speedy that I finally asked a wise friend if this was, perhaps, <em>like being on cocaine but without the fun. </em>He assured me cocaine is also without the fun and suddenly Westminster’s resentful paranoia and spite made a lot more sense…</p><p>I also had the <em>thing</em> <em>thing</em>. Did I mean to write <em>cupboard</em>? Did I mean <em>brick? </em>Nouns became random – including the noun <em>noun.</em> For a writer, this was less than ideal. I’ve improved, but when I glimpse Robert Jenrick and think <em>bespectacled semi-sentient buttock, </em>I do briefly wonder if I mean that. He usually provides a helpful clue – for example, by declaring the defining characteristic of housing for refugees should be cruelty. Still, life remains hard to grasp – possibly because legions of information warriors are profitably firehosing threats at me 24/7. And I have <em>brain fog</em>.

<p>Since his breakout role in the hit series Ted Lasso, Brixton boy Toheeb Jimoh has been nominated for an Emmy – and now Hollywood is calling. He talks to Tim Lewis about staying grounded, and how he’s finding his way</p><p>If early Lockdown One was dominated, in televisual terms, by Netflix’s weird and amoral documentary <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tiger-king" title="">Tiger King</a></em>, then the middle phase belonged to <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/15/ted-lasso-season-three-review-still-so-charming-it-brings-order-to-our-crumbling-universe" title="">Ted Lasso</a></em>. When its first episode dropped on Apple TV+ in August 2020, the premise felt familiar and unchallenging. It was a comedy – even sillier, a sports comedy – about an American coach played by the always-likable <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/jul/24/jason-sudeikis-ted-lasso-apple-tv-golden-globes" title="">Jason Sudeikis,</a> who is parachuted in to save a struggling English Premier League football team, AFC Richmond. Cue lots of fish-out-of-water gags, soccer-football misunderstandings and a narrative arc that ultimately sees the perennial underdogs bite back.</p><p><em>Ted Lasso</em> was all that, but it emerged that it was a lot more, too. Much like Lasso himself, the show won over doubters with waves of relentless positivity and an underlying message that kindness prevails. “It tricks you with the whole sports comedy part of it, right?” says Toheeb Jimoh, who plays AFC Richmond linchpin Sam Obisanya. “It becomes a way to Trojan horse these really interesting characters and truths about us through the guise of, ‘Oh, it’s just this zany comedy about football and Americans and British people.’ And you can’t look past the fact that we were all locked at home, no one could see their parents or hug each other. It came at a really important time for…” he stops and laughs: “the world! But we couldn’t have known that when we were making it. There was just some universe magic dust sprinkled over it.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/09/toheeb-jimoh-i-look-for-the-good-in-situations-the-power-ted-lasso">Continue reading...</a>

The party’s extremely long stretch in power at Holyrood is finally catching up with it<p>What has been seen cannot be unseen. Some images are so potent that they become indelibly etched on to a nation’s retina. I think we can say that of the scenes in a comfortable suburb of Glasgow when police raided the home of Nicola Sturgeon, until very recently the all-dominant first minister of Scotland and in times past the most popular politician in the UK, and her husband, Peter Murrell, until very recently the SNP’s mightiest apparatchik and the maestro of its multiple election victories.</p><p>Police Scotland used incident tape to cordon off the location and erected a large tent over the front of the house. “It’s hard to get the imagery of the tent out of your mind,” <a href="https://www.thenational.scot/news/23441292.stephen-flynn-shock-see-forensic-police-tent-snp-probe/" title="">confessed Stephen Flynn</a>, the SNP’s leader at Westminster. Sure is. When some officers were seen in the garden brandishing spades, the casual viewer could have mistaken this for an episode of <em>Silent Witness</em> or <em>Unforgotten</em>. Another police squad searched the party’s headquarters in Edinburgh and removed many crates of material. Mr Murrell <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/05/peter-murrell-nicola-sturgeons-husband-arrested-over-snp-funding-investigation" title="">was arrested</a>, taken into custody for <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/nicola-sturgeon-peter-murrell-arrested-update-today-b2316382.html" title="">more than 11 hours</a> and questioned by detectives over allegations about the party’s finances before being released without charge pending further investigations. Party spin doctors sometimes describe events in terms of “the optics”. The optics of this are beyond ghastly for the SNP and beyond wonderful for their opponents.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/09/as-the-snp-loses-its-iron-grip-on-scotland-labour-must-seize-this-golden-opportunity">Continue reading...</a>

The former student who made the tape, John Bloomfield, hopes to have it enhanced with the same kind of technology that has recently improved other early Beatles demo tapes and first studio takes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/09/please-please-us-lost-tape-of-beatles-school-gig-could-be-saved-for-the-nation">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A photograph of black bears in Asheville – a city where the animals have made headlines – shows how well some have adapted to urban living</p><p>It’s five years since the <em>Asheville Citizen-Times</em> <a href="https://eu.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2018/09/17/bear-busts-out-window-enters-kitchen-eats-muffin-mix/1338163002/">ran</a> the memorable headline: “Bear trapped in car busts out window, enters kitchen, eats muffin mix, skedaddles”. Since then, residents of the North Carolina city – population 94,500 – have become ever more used to living with black bears in their midst. There are up to <a href="https://www.townofblackmountain.org/269/Black-Bear-Ecology#:~:text=Black%20bears%20are%20found%20in,the%20Coast%20than%20the%20Mountains.">6,000 bears</a> in the western part of North Carolina and as their natural woodland habitat is encroached upon by housing, some have adopted more urban ways of life.</p><p>The photographer <a href="https://coreyfishes.com/">Corey Arnold</a> took this picture with a fixed camera at the back of a house where the family are used to seeing young bears share their kids’ rope swing. The picture is part of Arnold’s series Cities Gone Wild, shortlisted for a Sony world photography award. The series focuses on the obverse of the usual narrative of animal habitats destroyed by human activity, looking at those species that have adapted well to city living. A recent study of Asheville’s younger bears found that they were twice as heavy and produced their first cubs two years before their rural cousins, a result of the high-calorie diet they had learned to forage from rubbish bins.</p><p>Corey Arnold’s Cities Gone Wild series is shortlisted in the <a href="http://worldphoto.org/">Sony world photography awards 2023</a>. An exhibition of the photographs is at Somerset House, London, 14 April-1 May</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/09/the-big-picture-someones-been-playing-on-my-swing-corey-arnold-sony-world-photography-black-bears">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I suspect you have a pattern of believing that that whatever choice you make, it’s is the wrong one. You can work through this with a therapist</p><p><em><strong>The dilemma</strong></em><strong> </strong><em>I am a 70-year-old woman and am consumed by regret and disappointment. Outwardly, I am happy, calm and outgoing, with friends and interests, but this facade hides my inner feelings</em><em>, which I share with no one</em><em>.</em></p><p><em>I married too young and chose the wrong man. I said yes when he asked me to marry him, and I felt unable to go back on my word. Throughout our marriage I have not been in love with him. In fact, I am massively ashamed to say that, at times over the decades, I have wished him dead – yet he has never done me harm, which makes it even more shameful. In contrast, he has always been steadfast in his love for me, and this continued even though five years into our marriage I had an affair. I went back to him after three months apart, mainly because I was lonely, and we have been together ever since.</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/09/i-am-70-and-so-full-of-regret-about-my-husband-and-career-ask-philippa-perry">Continue reading...</a>

Then, says Thom, we’re going to the wrong place. I ask the driver to pull over. This is a new one on me. I am generally all over where I am going to review.
