Copyright 2023.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><hr /><p>Predictive policing comes from the \u201cbroken windows\u201d era of policing and is usually credited to William Bratton, former New York City police commissioner and LAPD chief. As NYC police commissioner, Bratton launched CompStat, which is perhaps the best-known example of data-driven policing because it appeared as an antagonist called \u201cComstat\u201d on season three of HBO\u2019s <em>The Wire</em>. \u201cCompStat, a management model linking crime and enforcement statistics, is multifaceted: it serves as a crime control strategy, a personnel performance and accountability metric, and a resource management tool,\u201d writes sociologist Sarah Brayne in her book <em>Predict and Surveil</em>. \u201cCrime data is collected in real time, then mapped and analyzed in preparation for weekly crime control strategy meetings between police executives and precinct commanders.\u201d CompStat was widely adopted by police forces in major American cities in the 1990s and 2000s. By relying heavily on crime statistics as a performance metric, the CompStat era trained police and bureaucrats to prioritize quantification over accountability. Additionally, the weekly meetings about crime statistics served as rituals of quantification that led the participants to believe in the numbers in a way that created collective solidarity and fostered what organizational behaviorists Melissa Mazmanian and Christine Beckman call \u201can underlying belief in the objective authority of numbers to motivate action, assess success, and drive continuous organizational growth.\u201d In other words: technochauvinism became the culture inside departments that adopted CompStat and other such systems. Organizational processes and controls became oriented around numbers that were believed to be \u201cobjective\u201d and \u201cneutral.\u201d This paved the way for the adoption of AI and computer models to intensify policing\u2014and intensify surveillance and harassment in communities that were already over-policed.</p><p>Computer models are only the latest trend in a long history of people imagining that software applied to crime will make us safer. In <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-07-hitting-the-books-black-software-charlton-mcilwain.html\"><em>Black Software</em></a>, Charlton McIlwain traced the history of police imagining that software equals salvation as far back as the 1960s, the dawn of the computational era. Back then, Thomas J. Watson, Jr., the head of IBM, was trying to popularize computers so more people would buy them. Watson had also committed (financially and existentially) to the War on Poverty declared by President Lyndon Johnson upon his election in 1964. \u201cWatson searched for opportunities to be relevant,\u201d McIlwain writes. \u201cHe said he wanted to help address the social ills that plagued society, particularly the plight of America\u2019s urban poor... He didn\u2019t know what he was doing.\u201d6 Watson wanted to sell computers and software, so he offered his company\u2019s computational expertise for an area that he knew nothing about, in order to solve a social problem that he didn\u2019t understand using tools that the social problem experts didn\u2019t understand. He succeeded, and it set up a dynamic between Big Tech and policing that still persists. Software firms like Palantir, Clearview AI, and PredPol create biased targeting software that they label \u201cpredictive policing,\u201d as if it were a positive innovation. They convince police departments to spend taxpayer dollars on biased software that ends up making citizens\u2019 lives worse. In the previous chapter, we saw how facial recognition technology leads police to persecute innocent people <em>after</em> a crime has been committed. Predictive policing technology leads police to pursue innocent people <em>before</em> a crime even takes place.</p><p>It\u2019s trIcky to write about specific policing software because what Chicago\u2019s police department does is not exactly the same as what LAPD or NYPD does. It is hard to say exactly what is happening in each police agency because the technology is changing constantly and is being deployed in different ways. The exact specifications tend to be buried in vendor contracts. Even if a police department buys software, it is not necessarily being used, nor is it being used in precisely the way it was intended. Context matters, and so does the exact implementation of technology, as well as the people who use it. Consider license plate readers, which are used to collect tolls or to conduct surveillance. Automated license plate readers used by a state transportation authority to automatically collect tolls is probably an acceptable use of AI and automated license plate reader technology\u2014if the data is not stored for a long time. The same license plate reader tech used by police as part of dragnet surveillance, with data stored indefinitely, is problematic.</p><p>Every time the public has become aware of some predictive policing measure, controversy has erupted. Consider the person-based predictive policing enacted by the Pasco County Sheriff\u2019s Office in Florida, which created a watchlist of people it considered future criminals. Tampa Bay Times reporters Kathleen McGrory and Neil Bedi won a Pulitzer for their story about how the Pasco County Sheriff\u2019s Office generated lists of people it considered likely to break the law. The list was compiled by using data on arrest histories and unspecified intelligence, coupled with arbitrary decisions by police analysts. The sheriff\u2019s department sent deputies to monitor and harass the people on the watchlist. Often, the deputies lacked probable cause, search warrants, or evidence of a crime. In five years, almost 1,000 people were caught up in the systematic harassment labeled \u201cIntelligence-Led Policing.\u201d Notably, a large percentage of the people on the watchlist were BIPOC.</p><p>The Pasco program started in 2011, shortly after Chris Nocco took office as sheriff. Nocco came up with the idea to \u201creform\u201d the department with data-driven initiatives. \u201cFor 10 years, nobody really understood how this worked, and the public wasn\u2019t aware of what was going on,\u201d said Bedi, explaining the reporting project.8 The sheriff built a \u201ccontroversial data-driven approach to policing. He also built a wide circle of powerful friends,\u201d including local and national politicians, who didn\u2019t question his actions.</p><p>The harassment didn\u2019t stop there, however. Separately, the Sheriff\u2019s Office created a list of schoolchildren it considered likely to become future criminals. The office gathered data from local schools, including protected information like children\u2019s grades, school attendance records, and child welfare histories. Parents and teachers were not told that children were designated as future criminals, nor did they understand that the students\u2019 private data was being weaponized. The school system\u2019s superintendent initially didn\u2019t realize the police had access to student data, said Kathleen McGrory.</p><p>Once the investigation was published, civil liberties groups denounced the intelligence programs. Thirty groups formed a coalition to protest, and four of the targeted people brought lawsuits against the agency. Two bills were proposed to prevent this kind of invasion and misuse in the future. The federal Department of Education opened an investigation into the data sharing between the Sheriff\u2019s Office and the local school district. Fortunately, as a result, police analysts will no longer have access to student grades.</p><p>Many people imagine that using more technology will make things \u201cfairer.\u201d This is behind the idea of using machines instead of judges, an idea that surfaces periodically among lawyers and computer scientists. We see it in the adoption of body-worn cameras, an initiative that has been growing since LAPD officers brutally assaulted Rodney King in 1991 and the attack was captured on a home camcorder. There\u2019s an imaginary world where everything is captured on video, there are perfectly fair and objective algorithms that adjudicate what happens in the video feed, facial recognition identifies bad actors, and the heroic police officers go in and save the day and capture the bad guys. This fantasy is taken to its logical conclusion in the film <em>Minority Report</em>, where Tom Cruise plays a police officer who arrests people before they commit crimes, on the recommendation of some teenagers with precognition who are held captive in a swimming pool full of goo. \u201cIt\u2019s just like <em>Minority Report</em>,\u201d a police officer marveled to sociologist Sarah Brayne, when the two were discussing Palantir\u2019s policing software.</p><p>What makes this situation additionally difficult is the fact that many of the people involved in the chain are not malevolent. For example, my cousin, who is white, was a state police officer for years. He\u2019s wonderful and kind and honest and upstanding and exactly the person I would call on if I were in trouble. He and his family are very dear to me and I to them. I believe in the law, and I believe in law enforcement in the abstract, in the way that many people do when they have the privilege of not interacting with or being targeted by law enforcement or the courts.</p><p>But the origins of policing are problematic for Black people like me, and the frequency of egregious abuses by police is out of control in today\u2019s United States. Police technology and machine fairness are the reasons why we need to pause and fix the human system before implementing any kind of digital system in policing.</p><p>The current system of policing in the United States, with the Fraternal Order of Police and the uniforms and so on, began in South Carolina. Specifically, it emerged in the 1700s in Charleston, South Carolina, as a slave patrol. \u201cIt was quite literally a professional force of white free people who came together to maintain social control of black, enslaved people living inside the city of Charleston,\u201d said ACLU Policing Policy Director Paige Fernandez in a 2021 podcast. \u201cThey came together for the sole purpose of ensuring that enslaved black people did not organize and revolt and push back on slavery. That is the first example of a modern police department in the United States.\u201d In her book Dark Matters: Surveillance of Blackness, scholar Simone Brown connects modern surveillance of Black bodies to chattel slavery via lantern laws, which were eighteenth-century laws in New York City requiring Black or mixed-race people to carry a lantern if out at night unaccompanied by a white person. Scholar Josh Scannell sees lantern laws as the precedent for today\u2019s policy of police using floodlights to illuminate high-crime areas all night long. People who live in heavily policed neighborhoods never get the peaceful cloak of darkness, as floodlights make it artificially light all night long and the loud drone of the generators for the lights makes the neighborhood noisier.</p><p>The ACLU\u2019s Fernandez draws a line from slave patrols maintaining control over Black people to the development of police departments to the implementation of Jim Crow\u2013era rules and laws to police enforcing segregation during the civil rights era and inciting violence against peaceful protestors to escalating police violence against Black and Brown people and leading to the Black Lives Matter movement. Fernandez points out that the police tear-gassed and pepper-sprayed peaceful protestors in the summer of 2020, fired rubber bullets at protestors, charged at protestors, and used techniques like kettling to corner protestors into closed spaces where violence could be inflicted more easily.</p><p>The statistics paint a grim picture. \u201cBlack people are 3.5 times more likely than white people to be killed by police when Blacks are not attacking or do not have a weapon. George Floyd is an example,\u201d writes sociologist Rashawn Ray in a 2020 Brookings Institute policy brief about police accountability.14 \u201cBlack teenagers are 21 times more likely than white teenagers to be killed by police. That\u2019s Tamir Rice and Antwon Rose. A Black person is killed about every 40 hours in the United States. That\u2019s Jonathan Ferrell and Korryn Gaines. One out of every one thousand Black men can expect to be killed by police violence over the life course. This is Tamir Rice and Philando Castile.\u201d When Derek Chauvin, the police officer who killed George Floyd, was found guilty, it was remarkable because police are so rarely held accountable for violence against Black and Brown bodies.</p><p>Reform is needed. That reform, however, will not be found in machines.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-more-than-a-glitch-meredith-broussard-mit-press-143009017.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-more-than-a-glitch-meredith-broussard-mit-press-143009017.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-09 14:30:09+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
