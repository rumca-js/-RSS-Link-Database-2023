## Rosewater by Liv Little review – a lyrical love affair

<p>The gal-dem founder’s debut is an intensely moving evocation of hard-won romance, found family and peril, laced with humour and poetry</p><p>Where is home? Do we ever really know where we belong? These are the questions that drive <em>gal-dem</em> founder Liv Little’s debut novel, <em>Rosewater</em>. At its centre is Elsie Macintosh, a gay 28-year-old poet of black Guyanese descent who left her parents’ house in Bristol after she tired of minding her twin brothers and settled down by herself in south London. The book opens on the morning Elsie is evicted from her flat.</p><p>For most of the book, Elsie is standing at the edge of a precipice, looking down. She is jobless and finds herself living with her estranged best friend, Juliet. For a long time, compliments about Elsie’s poetry “don’t convert to cash or opportunities”. Yet <em>Rosewater</em> is never mournful or dull. Little has a touch for counterbalancing tragedy with humour and moments of real, rousing joy. It’s such a relief to see the women in Elsie’s life – Juliet, Elsie’s friend for sex Bea, her maternal grandmother, as well as her older lesbian friend Maggie – keep her going. Think drinks, impromptu darts session and helpings of goat curry. Think lingerie-shopping and bonding over <em>RuPaul’s Drag Race</em>. It’s a pleasure too to read Elsie’s raw, heartfelt poetry (written for the book<strong> </strong>by the spoken word poet Kai-Isaiah Jamal) or the refreshingly original sex scenes that Little grounds in play, consent and mutuality.</p><p><em>Rosewater</em> by Liv Little is published by Dialogue (£16.99).

## The Selecter’s Pauline Black: ‘When we get on stage, something alchemical happens’

<p>As the ska band release a new album, their formidable frontwoman talks candidly about the heyday of 2 Tone, doing battle with men and microaggressions, and finding her birth mother at 42</p><p>“I like,” says Pauline Black, “to be mistress of my own shit.” It’s an admirable approach to life; also a sensible one, when you’ve had a life as varied as Black’s. Though she’s known as the singer in the Selecter, the Coventry 2 Tone band who gave us <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/apr/21/how-we-made-on-my-radio-the-selecter">On My Radio</a> and Three Minute Hero, Black has actually had many working lives. A quick CV: she started off as a hospital radiographer, before quitting in 1979 when the Selecter took off. Three years later, when the band split, she became a TV presenter, moving between kids’ telly (Granada TV’s <em>Hold Tight!</em>) and <em>Black </em><em>on Black</em>, Channel 4’s British black magazine show. Then: an actor, winning <em>Time Out</em>’s best actress in 1991 for her stage portrayal of Billie Holiday. She found acting interesting, and liked “the discipline”, but got “fed up” with the lack of control. “I spent 10 years acting. Once I went back to music, I was happy. I don’t like being directed.”</p><p>So, on and off for the past three decades, Black has been mistress of her most natural, joy-giving role: as singer, songwriter and frontperson of the Selecter. For the young’uns: the Selecter were one of the founding bands of 2 Tone, the multi-racial ska-punk-rocksteady independent record label set up by the Specials’ Jerry Dammers in the late 1970s (others included the Specials, Madness, the Beat, the Bodysnatchers). They were the blackest band on the roster, plus the only one with both a male and female frontperson, Arthur “Gaps” Hendrickson smooth skanking alongside Black’s peppy fire.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/09/the-selecter-pauline-black-ska-2-tone-human-algebra-interview">Continue reading...</a>

The Bayern Munich centre-back, an important figure for France during their run to the final of the 2022 World Cup, was eight when he first experienced problems with his speech and he has not forgotten the taunts that would fly in his direction during childhood.</p><p>“I was very scared,” Upamecano admits on a still afternoon at Clairefontaine, France’s celebrated training centre. “When you have a stammer as a kid you’re scared to talk because people will make fun of you. It’s difficult to distance yourself from it. You say to yourself all the time: ‘If I talk people will make fun.’ You don’t want to go up to the blackboard, or communicate in general, because you know people will be mocking you.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/09/dayot-upamecano-bayern-munich-stammer-kylian-mbappe-manchester-city">Continue reading...</a>

Witnessing equality before the law is surely reason enough to have had Donald Trump on camera<p>After the recent joys of the Boris Johnson interrogation, Donald Trump’s New York indictment could only be, for connoisseurs of extended demagogue-humbling, a two-star show.</p><p>Delightful as it was to watch Trump fail to make something dashing of his entrance, the judge’s refusal to indulge broadcasters meant the public were denied even the sound of his historic contribution: “Not guilty.” His team had objected, as is sometimes convincing from lawyers whose famous clients are less like clowns, that it would “create a circus-like atmosphere”. Broadcasting permission, as demonstrated in the irresistible US footage of Gwyneth Paltrow’s jumpers, can depend on the judge and the state, as well as the country. In the UK, David Pannick KC was an early if unavailing enthusiast. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1464884918760025" title="">“It is difficult,” he wrote</a>, “to even formulate an argument against the admission of the television camera and the radio microphone into British courts if the parties do not object and there are no witnesses giving evidence who may be influenced by the broadcasting of proceedings.” That was in 1984.</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

## A culture of truth denial is wilting US democracy and Britain is following fast | Will Hutton

GB News is chasing Fox down a path of being economical with the facts, culminating in assertions last week that a liberal elite is running the UK<p>The United States is a grim warning of what happens when a society dispenses with the idea of truth. Fragmentation, paranoia, division and myth rule – democracy wilts. Fox News, we now know from emails flushed out <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/mar/31/fox-news-dominion-voting-systems-case-trial" title="">by a lawsuit</a> from the voting machine company Dominion, feared it would lose audiences if it told the truth about the 2020 presidential election result. Instead, it knowingly broadcast and fed Donald Trump’s lie that the election had been stolen – in particular the known unfounded allegation that Dominion had programmed its voting machines to throw millions of votes to the Democrats. Fox could have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/feb/28/rupert-murdoch-deposition-fox-news-dominion-voting-systems" title="">instructed to tell the truth by its owner</a>, as this month’s <em><a href="https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/podcasts/prospect-podcast/60956/bad-news-how-murdoch-and-fox-are-wrecking-us-democracy" title="">Prospect</a></em><a href="https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/podcasts/prospect-podcast/60956/bad-news-how-murdoch-and-fox-are-wrecking-us-democracy" title=""> magazine details</a>, but as Rupert Murdoch acknowledged under oath: “I could have. But I didn’t.” There was no penalty for lying, except being on the wrong side of a $1.6bn lawsuit.</p><p>But the culture of truth denial is no accident; it was a key stratagem of the US right as it fought to build a counter-establishment in the 1970s, 80s and 90s that would challenge and even supplant what it considered an over-dominant liberal establishment. Unalloyed facts, truthful evidence and balanced reporting on everything from guns to climate change tended to support liberals and their worldview. But if all facts could be framed as the contingent result of opinions, the right could fight on level terms. Indeed, because the right is richer, it could even so dominantly frame facts from its well-funded media that truth and misinformation would become so jumbled no one could tell the difference. “Stop the steal” is such a fact-denying strategy. Ally it with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/05/heritage-foundation-election-voting-rights-republican-states" title="">voter suppression</a> and getting your people into key roles in pivotal institutions and there are the bones of an anti-democratic coup.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/09/culture-truth-denial-wilting-us-democracy-britain-following-fast">Continue reading...</a>
