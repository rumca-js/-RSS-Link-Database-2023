Hello guys and gals, it's me Mutahar again! This time we sit down to take a look at QuantumTV, a rather controversial channel in recent YouTube history for his fleeting understanding of fair use principles. Quantum beyond poorly reviewing and calibrating televisions seems to have gotten into some serious problems, surprising literally no one. Thanks for watching!

Hello guys and gals, it's me Mutahar again! This time I had to learn that the Pinkerton Detective Agency was still an actual entity that was just contracted to go after someone for some early access to "Magic The Gathering" trading cards. I wish I could have made this up but reality is a strange dimension we reside in sometimes. Thanks for watching!
