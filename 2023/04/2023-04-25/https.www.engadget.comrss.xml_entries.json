Apple is finally bringing Health to the iPad with this year's iPadOS 17 release, the insiders say. A further update will supposedly help you track your mood by answering questions about your day. You may also use Health to manage vision issues like nearsightedness. A recent rumor also hinted that Apple may release a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-is-reportedly-working-on-a-health-led-journaling-app-114058422.html\">journaling app</a>  to help document your days, much like Day One.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Apple has already declined to comment.

Today\u2019s battery technology (including <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/catls-new-battery-tech-could-inch-electric-planes-closer-to-reality-200531533.html\">CATL\u2019s</a> new, more efficient one) severely <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/we-wont-have-electric-airplanes-until-battery-tech-improves-160058357.html\">limits the practicality</a> of zero-emission aircraft, leaving clean-energy innovators with two incomplete options: flying a plane full of batteries or one full of people \u2014 but not both. So the California-based startup wants to tie them together, extending the rear plane\u2019s range by hundreds of miles.</p><p>Towing planes isn\u2019t a new concept, with military use going back to World War II when aerial tows would pull smaller aircraft carrying troops and supplies. But applying it to the world of green transportation is new. Magpie Aviation\u2019s concept uses one or more electric aircraft to act as a tractor plane towing a passenger (or cargo) aircraft using a long cable. The towed plane would have enough battery power for takeoff, landing and flying to alternate airports but not enough to fly the full distance on its own, as <a href=\"https://www.aerotime.aero/articles/magpie-aviation-wants-to-tow-you-to-your-destination\">reported by</a><em>AeroTime</em>.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The lead plane would take on the bulk of the traction, and when its battery is depleted, it could hand off towing duties to another electric towing aircraft to extend the rear plane\u2019s range. Magpie CEO Damon Vander Lind <a href=\"https://aviationweek.com/aerospace/emerging-technologies/magpie-unveils-concept-long-range-sustainable-flight\">summarized to</a><em>Aviation Week</em>, \u201cYou get towed until you\u2019ve depleted down to your reserve in the lead aircraft, and then you swap in another tow aircraft.\u201d Although it\u2019s still a regional solution impractical for cross-country or international flights, Vander Lind says it could allow for a trip from San Francisco to Seattle \u2014 far beyond the sub-regional distances battery-powered passenger flights can <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/zeroavia-flight-largest-aircraft-hydrogen-electric-engine-201422671.html\">travel on their own</a>.</p><div id=\"4d81d86a4f1d4514ac3210de892dac25\"></div><p>Magpie says it\u2019s conducted successful small-scale tests using a synthetic fiber rope around 330 ft. long; the company envisions a later commercial version to use nearly mile-long cables. The startup plans to scale up its testing gradually and believes it could be implemented commercially by 2030. It expects advances in battery tech to allow it to tow single-aisle airliners eventually. Magpie suggests that the concept, mainly targeting electric planes, could also work with hybrid, hydrogen and standard aircraft in low-power modes. Additionally, the company says it\u2019s working with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) with an eye toward certification.</p><p>\u201cIt sounds kind of crazy, but we kept coming back to it because we couldn\u2019t find any reason why we couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d said Vander Lind. \u201cWhile our modeling shows that there is an advantage to doing a custom tow aircraft like this, we get a big advantage because the more expensive and critical passenger- and cargo-carrying \u2018main aircraft\u2019 has similar requirements to today\u2019s aircraft and so adapts well to existing in-operation and already-in-development platforms. Remember that if we want to hit a zero-carbon 2050 goal, an airliner has a 30-year life, so we\u2019re already at the point where airlines have to think hard about the operating life of the assets that they are buying today.\u201d</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/electric-airplane-towing-concept-could-mean-longer-zero-emission-flights-205023296.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/electric-airplane-towing-concept-could-mean-longer-zero-emission-flights-205023296.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-25 20:50:23+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Twitter starts putting labels on tweets with restricted reach", "description": "<p>It should now be easier to deduce whether <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/twitter/\"><ins>Twitter</ins></a> has <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-will-label-tweets-limited-due-to-hate-policy-violations-170438879.html\"><ins>restricted the visibility of a tweet</ins></a> over a possible violation of the company's hateful conduct policy.

The Orochi V2, for instance, comes with the \u201cRazer Cyberpack,\u201d a backpack shaped like a mouse. Meanwhile, the BlackWidow lets you adorn your Roblox avatar with a set keyboard wings. If that wasn\u2019t weird enough, none of the in-game items are one-for-one recreations of their real-world counterparts.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Pricing starts at $90 for the mouse, while the headset and mechanical keyboard will cost $130 and $180, respectively. In other words, each Roblox Edition accessory costs more than you would pay for those devices normally. For instance, the standard black, white and quartz Orochi V2 colorways cost $70 when they\u2019re not on sale. You\u2019re basically paying extra for your kid to show off to their friends on Roblox. The entire line will go on sale on April 28th through the Razer website and select retailers.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/razers-roblox-edition-accessories-will-let-your-kids-friends-know-they-come-from-money-180006348.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/razers-roblox-edition-accessories-will-let-your-kids-friends-know-they-come-from-money-180006348.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-25 18:00:06+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "OpenAI improves ChatGPT privacy with new data controls", "description": "<p>OpenAI is tightening up ChatGPT\u2019s privacy controls.

Prosecutors say all the defendants were directly involved with Terra, having handled marketing, systems development and management. In addition, prosecutors have frozen 246.8 billion won ($184.7 million) in assets from the defendants. Korean officials said they\u2019re working with the US on the case, although they didn\u2019t go into specifics.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Billed as a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/binance-sued-over-collapse-terrausd-113503082.html\">stablecoin</a>, TerraUSD isn\u2019t backed by real-world assets or fiat currency. Instead, it\u2019s supported by Luna, the native cryptocurrency of the Terra blockchain, that supposedly had a mechanism to restore its value to $1 if its value ever failed. In addition, investors saw it as an alluring money-making opportunity because of its Anchor lending program, which promised annual yields of 20 percent for coin deposits.</p><p>However, prosecutors allege the Terra blockchain was a \u201cfabrication\u201d from the get-go, with the entire system essentially built on a house of cards. They claim the blockchain\u2019s algorithm that kept TerraUSD at a stable price was \u201cimpossible to get right.\u201d Its value collapsed in May 2022, when depositors lost confidence in the platform and simultaneously tried to sell off their investments. At the time of publication, Terra has a value of less than two cents.</p><p>Before the collapse, the defendants took 463 billion won (nearly $346 million) in profit. In addition, prosecutors claim they illegally exposed clients\u2019 payment details and embezzled funds. Authorities say those charged caused \u201castronomical damage\u201d to global investors as the crash also played a role in the collapse of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and the broader $2 trillion decline in the cryptocurrency market.</p><p>\u201cShin has nothing to do with the Terra, Luna collapse as he left the [company] two years before the fallout,\u201d said Shin\u2019s lawyer, Kim Ki-dong, in a statement. \u201cHe voluntarily returned to South Korea immediately after the collapse, and has been faithfully cooperating with the probe for over 10 months, hoping to contribute to fact finding.\u201d</p><p>In September, Korean authorities issued an arrest warrant for Shin\u2019s co-founder, Do Kwon, who was also <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/interpol-red-notice-terraform-founder-do-kwon-104327535.html\">placed on an Interpol &quot;red notice&quot;</a> list at <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/south-korean-prosecutors-interpol-terraform-labs-ceo-do-kwon-060719940.html\">South Korea\u2019s request</a>.

It was <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-resurgence-spring-2022-031021311.html\"><ins>supposed to come out in spring of 2022</ins></a>, but better late than never, right? The title launches for the PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and PC via the Epic Games Store. So pretty much everything but the Switch.</p><p>If the term \u201cnarrative adventure game\u201d brings to mind Telltale classics like <em>The Walking Dead </em>and <em>The Wolf Among Us</em>, there is a good reason. Dramatic Labs is made up of former Telltale developers, some of which worked on those iconic adventure games. So you can expect a title that prioritizes making tough decisions over whiz-bang action. Star Trek as a franchise seems especially suited to this style of play, given the often thoughtful nature of the stories.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"926aa20347b243c8a0ef49fd04b731b1\"></div><p><em>Star Trek: Resurgence</em> is set shortly after the events of <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em>, placing it before the events of <em>Star Trek: Picard</em> but relatively concurrent with the events of <em>Star Trek: Lower Decks</em>. This is Star Trek. There are lots of timelines to keep track of.</p><p>The game features two playable lead characters, neither of which will be familiar to fans. However, Dramatic Labs has teased the presence of legacy characters from throughout the universe, and it has already revealed that the one and only Spock will feature heavily in the storyline. This is not the Spock from the original <em>Star Trek</em> and its sequel movies, but rather the aged Ambassador Spock as seen in <em>The Next Generation</em> timeline. The story involves stopping a war between two alien races, which is something the Vulcan ambassador would most certainly get behind.</p><p><em>Resurgence</em> uses the Unreal 5 engine, which should eliminate some of the jankiness surrounding old-school Telltale games. There is also plenty of talent behind the scenes, so this is something to be cautiously optimistic about, as it has been a long time since a truly iconic Star Trek game appeared on our radar. In any event, we only have a month to find out if <em>Resurgence</em> lives up to classic early 2000s titles like <em>Star Trek: Bridge Commander.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-resurgence-launches-may-23rd-on-most-platforms-170248699.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-resurgence-launches-may-23rd-on-most-platforms-170248699.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-25 17:02:48+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Vitamix blenders are up to 31 percent off right now", "description": "<p>Vitamix makes some of the most powerful blenders you can buy and right now many are on sale for the lowest prices we've seen this year.

The rover is also historic as the UAE's first lunar craft.</p><div id=\"68eff17456f641289cfd1c2779fce7d5\"><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>Hakuto-R launched aboard a SpaceX rocket about 100 days ago. The landing is divided into six stages that include a de-orbit insertion, a largely unpowered \"cruise\" phase, a braking burn, a reorientation and two final phases where the machine slows down and (hopefully) reaches the surface intact. Israel's SpaceIL tried a private Moon landing in 2019, but it <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-14-beresheet-moon-probe-final-image-the-big-picture.html\">crashed following an engine failure</a>.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>A completed landing will help ispace's goals of sending two more landers to the Moon in 2024 and 2025.

Between them, the models account for most of GM's EV sales and the company plans to make more than 70,000 of them this year \u2014 that marks a record rate of production, according to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/25/gm-bolt-ev-production-to-end-later-this-year.html\"><em><ins>CNBC</ins></em></a>.</p><p>However, the Bolt's battery cells are based on an older design and GM is transitioning to its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gm-is-placing-all-of-its-ev-eggs-in-the-ultum-battery-basket-163038784.html\"><ins>Ultium system</ins></a>. According to Barra, GM will modify a Detroit-area plant where it makes the Chevy Bolts so it can produce the electric <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/chevrolet-silverado-ev-details-ces-debut-171551300.html\"><ins>Chevy Silverado</ins></a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gm-officially-reveals-its-electrified-2024-gmc-sierra-denali-213601650.html\"><ins>GMC Sierra</ins></a> there starting in 2024.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The Bolt's battery system has led to some serious problems for GM in the past. In 2021, GM <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gm-expands-fire-risk-recall-all-chevy-bolt-115934063.html\"><ins>recalled</ins></a> every Bolt it had ever made to that point due to a battery manufacturing defect that posed a fire risk. The company spent some $1.8 billion to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gm-replace-chevy-bolt-battery-modules-fire-risk-100027066.html\"><ins>resolve</ins></a> the issues.</p><p>Considering GM's plan to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gm-to-exclusively-sell-zero-emissions-cars-by-2035-164418993.html\"><ins>switch entirely to EVs</ins></a> by 2035, it makes sense to use the same battery tech across all of its models to help it ramp up the pace of production. After the Michigan plant has been retrofitted and reaches full production, GM expects that it will be able to build 600,000 electric trucks per year. The company has a production target of 2 million EVs per year between the US and China.</p><p>The timing of the move may be a slightly risky one for the company. The Bolt, which arrived in 2016, is the most affordable option for a new EV from a major automaker. Last year, GM <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gm-2023-chevy-bolt-ev-euv-price-cut-193132395.html\"><ins>lowered the starting price</ins></a> of the 2023 Bolt EV to $26,595, plus a $995 destination fee. The relative affordability has helped GM achieve three consecutive quarters of record Bolt EV and EUV deliveries, Barra said in <a href=\"https://pressroom.gm.com/gmbx/us/en/pressroom/home/news.detail.html/Pages/news/emergency_news/2023/shareholders/q1-23-ceo-letter-to-shareholders.html\"><ins>a letter to shareholders</ins></a>.</p><p>GM says it delivered more than 20,000 EVs last quarter, which is a far cry from the 422,000 vehicles <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tesla-sets-new-company-record-after-delivering-more-than-422000-evs-in-q1-2023-171816368.html\"><ins>Tesla delivered in Q1</ins></a>.

A first volume premieres June 29th, while you'll have to wait until July 27th to see the rest. That's not entirely voluntary. As show creator Lauren Schmidt Hissirch told <em>Collider</em> in an <a href=\"https://collider.com/the-witcher-blood-origin-lauren-hissrich-declan-de-barra-interview/\">interview</a> this December, there was a possibility the challenges of producing visual effects would require dividing the season.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"7bd6e13af5624481bd0dd4dde4c085e5\"><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>It may be a bittersweet season for fans. Cavill is known to be a fan of all things Witcher (both the novels and the games), and many seem him as synonymous with the on-screen representation of Geralt. Liam Hemsworth is set to replace Cavill in season four. It's too soon to say how well Hemsworth will fare, but it's safe to presume he'll bring something different to the role.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-witcher-season-3-trailer-shows-henry-cavills-last-stint-as-geralt-154524461.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/the-witcher-season-3-trailer-shows-henry-cavills-last-stint-as-geralt-154524461.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-25 15:45:24+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Cruise self-driving taxis can now operate around the clock in San Francisco", "description": "<p>You won't necessarily have to hail one of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cruise-charge-fully-driverless-rides-san-francisco-092000547.html\">Cruise's robotaxis</a> at night in San Francisco.

As of March 31st, 515 million people were using the audio streaming service. That's the first time Spotify has had more than half a billion users. Q1 was also Spotify's second-biggest quarter for user growth to date \u2014 its audience increased by five percent from the previous quarter and 22 percent year over year. The user base grew by 26 million, which is 15 million more than Spotify had expected. The company said it saw growth in both developed and developing markets, as well as almost every age group.</p><p>Most of that growth is based on folks who use the free, ad-supported version of the Spotify service. Premium subscriptions didn't keep pace with the overall growth, as they rose by two percent from the previous quarter and 15 percent year over year from 205 million to 210 million. Still, premium subscribers grew by 3 million more than Spotify had indicated in its guidance to investors.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Overall, Spotify posted a net operating loss of \u20ac156 million ($172 million) for the quarter. That's far more than the \u20ac6 million ($6.6 million) loss it saw in the first quarter of 2022, though it's an improvement over the \u20ac270 million ($297 million) Spotify lost the previous quarter.</p><p>While overall revenue was up by 14 percent year over year from \u20ac2.66 billion ($2.93 billion) to \u20ac3.04 billion ($3.34 billion), it dipped by four percent from the previous quarter. Revenue from paid subscribers didn't change significantly from Q4 2022, but it dropped by 27 percent on the ad-supported side from \u20ac449 million ($494 million) to \u20ac329 million ($362 million) \u2014 though revenue from free users rose by 17 percent year over year. The quarter-to-quarter drop is perhaps a result of advertisers tightening their belts somewhat, leading to lower ad spend.</p><p>Advertisers aren't the only businesses trying to rein in costs. Spotify, like <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech-layoffs-183005386.html\"><ins>many other major tech companies in recent months</ins></a>, has laid off a sizable proportion of its staff. In January, the company <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/spotify-will-lay-off-6-percent-of-employees-130337498.html\"><ins>laid off</ins></a> six percent of workers, which equates to around 600 people based on the 9,800 that Spotify employed as of the end of 2022.</p><p>Additionally, Spotify seems to be placing a bigger focus on the core parts of its business. It recently announced plans to shut down both its live audio app, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/spotify-is-shutting-down-its-standalone-live-audio-app-211056429.html\"><ins>Spotify Live</ins></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/spotify-will-shut-down-heardle-on-may-5th-151454849.html\"><em><ins>Heardle</ins></em></a>, the <em>Wordle</em>-style song-guessing game <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/spotify-is-buying-daily-music-trivia-game-heardle-165602642.html\"><ins>it bought last summer</ins></a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/spotify-reaches-more-than-half-a-billion-users-for-the-first-time-142818686.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/spotify-reaches-more-than-half-a-billion-users-for-the-first-time-142818686.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-25 14:28:18+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "ASUS ROG Ally hands-on: Possibly the most powerful handheld gaming PC yet", "description": "<p>When Valve released the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/steam-deck-review-small-hands-180026719.html\">Steam Deck</a> last year, it completely reinvigorated the market for handheld gaming PCs. In just the last six months we\u2019ve seen a fresh wave of rivals like the GPD Win 4 and the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ayaneo-2-review-specs-price-a-more-premium-and-pricier-take-on-the-steam-deck-143039617.html\">Ayaneo 2</a>. But now it\u2019s ASUS\u2019 turn with the ROG Ally and thanks to potent specs, a speedy screen and a slick design, we might be looking at the most powerful PC gaming handheld yet.</p><p>Now before we get in too deep, it\u2019s important to mention that ASUS hasn\u2019t provided official pricing or availability for ROG Ally\u2019s just yet, and we\u2019re still waiting for clarity regarding some of its more detailed specs. That\u2019s expected to happen on May 11th at its official launch. But from what I\u2019ve gotten a chance to play around with so far, there\u2019s a lot to get excited about.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"ddaa7c0ac9f24819b6e6c1df86a6eddd\"></div><p>Perhaps the most tantalizing thing about the Ally is its components. Not only does it feature a new Ryzen Z1 chip \u2013 which is a customized Zen 4/RDNA 3 APU designed specifically for handheld gaming PCs \u2013 it also has a 7-inch 1080p screen with 500 nits of brightness and a 120Hz refresh rate. That alone represents some very premium upgrades compared to the Steam Deck. And with ASUS claiming that the ROG Ally is between 50 and 100 percent more powerful than Valve\u2019s portable (depending on the power settings), it might have the performance necessary to make that screen really shine. With ASUS rounding out the ROG Ally\u2019s kit with up to 16GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD and a microSD card slot, there\u2019s very little to complain about in terms of hardware.</p><p>Then there\u2019s the screen, which might be the best looking display in this category. Colors were bright and rich and didn\u2019t look washed out on any game I played, which sometimes happens on the Steam Deck. And even though the panel is the same size as what you get on Valve\u2019s machine, the added resolution and that 120Hz refresh rate made games look both sharper and more fluid.</p><figure><img alt=\"For those who want even more performance, the ROG Ally can be connected to one of ASUS external GPUs via the company's XG mobile port. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/d0f829c0-e365-11ed-bdba-1a5faf7dd676\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Another notable difference is that unlike the Steam Deck, the ROG Ally runs Windows 11 which ASUS says was a deliberate move to make sure gamers could play all their favorite titles from any of the major stores (Steam, Epic Game Store, Battle.net, etc.). On top of that, ASUS added a few thoughtful software tweaks including a customized version of its Armoury Crate app along with a helpful button for quickly toggling between hardware settings for stuff like power draw, performance modes and more. And even on the preview devices I used, ASUS\u2019 software felt more responsive than similar apps on competitors like the Ayaneo 2.</p><p>As for its design, while ASUS isn\u2019t really innovating a ton compared to other devices in the category, there are a number of small touches I appreciate. You get a familiar assortment of shoulder and face buttons, with two macro buttons in back (one on each side). At 608 grams, the Ally is a bit lighter than the Steam Deck (669 grams) and it's significantly thinner and less bulky too. It doesn\u2019t have big beefy grips like some rivals, but ASUS says the angled contours on the side were designed specifically to make the device sit in your hand just right when you're resting your arms on a desk or table. My favorite nod toward general usability are the Ally\u2019s quiet fans. I noticed that while the system can get a bit toasty under load, even then it never got close to sounding like my Steam Deck, which emits a small whine pretty much anytime the fans are spinning.</p><p>For those who want even beefier performance, ASUS included an XG Mobile port so you can hook the ROG Ally up to one of the company\u2019s portable GPU docks. Admittedly, I\u2019m not sure I see the need to take a handheld PC and tether it to a big dock (even if it does provide better performance). And with the cheapest XG Mobile dock going for about $1000 (for an older 30-series card), it\u2019s a pricey way to upgrade Ally\u2019s performance. But for people who might already have one of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/asus-rog-flow-z-13-review-specs-price-impressions-170001149.html\">ASUS\u2019 Flow-series gaming laptops</a>, it\u2019s a nice bit of extra value.</p><p>All told, the only things you don\u2019t really get on the Ally are built-in touchpads like on the Steam Deck or a second USB-C jack like on the Ayaneo 2. And while ASUS has opted for standard analog control sticks instead of ones based on more sophisticated magnetic hall effect sensors, the company teased that it may be possible to swap in third-party joysticks in the future.</p><figure><img alt=\"As you might expect on a pc gaming handheld, the ROG Ally comes with customizable lighting around its analog stick and the rear of the system. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/03388b00-e366-11ed-9ffb-654703206cdd\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Even though the ROG Ally naturally draws a lot of comparisons between it and the Steam Deck, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re actually direct competitors. That\u2019s because while ASUS has yet to reveal official pricing, I\u2019m expecting the Ally to cost at least $800, which is twice the price of a base Steam Deck. Instead, it seems like the Ally is a better version of the Ayaneo 2. Not only is it more powerful, its software feels more polished and with ASUS being a significantly larger company I\u2019m hoping the Ally will come with better customer support too.</p><p>For people out there who are looking for a premium gaming handheld, the ROG Ally may have just leaped to the head of the pack. It has pretty much the fastest components you can fit in a system this size. My one concern at this point is if its 40Wh battery can deliver decent longevity while still pumping out strong performance. But more importantly, when I think about the category as a whole, it\u2019s really encouraging to see more big names enter the space and put their spin on a rapidly growing class of gadgets.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/asus-rog-ally-hands-on-possibly-the-most-powerful-handheld-gaming-pc-yet-140054506.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/asus-rog-ally-hands-on-possibly-the-most-powerful-handheld-gaming-pc-yet-140054506.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-25 14:00:54+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Slack rolls out its 'canvas' for sharing content with your team", "description": "<p>It took <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/slack-canvas-share-resources-huddles-120003868.html\">several months</a>, but Slack's &quot;canvas&quot; collaboration feature is finally <a href=\"https://slack.com/blog/news/meet-slack-canvas\">rolling out</a> across its apps.

Though considerably smaller than the 4/3 chip on the main Hasselblad camera, DJI says the camera is designed for  a \"range of different scenarios from framing intriguing buildings to cars in commercial shoots.\" That comment indicates that the quality should be better than the 7x tele camera. It can handle 48-megapixel (MP) high-res or 12MP low light photos, along with 4K/60fps video.&nbsp;</p><p>Like the main camera, it supports a new log format called D-log M along with DJI's original D-Log. D-Log M is designed to deliver \"natural color gradations with delicate details\" even in high-contrast situations like sunsets, the company says. At the same time, it's easier to grade than typical log footage, according to DJI. It can shoot up to 10-bit 4:2:2 ProRes video on the Mavic 3 Pro Cine model and 10-bit 4:2:0 (H.264/H.265) on the regular model.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt=\"DJI's Mavic 3 Pro comes with a triple-camera setup\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/18a6d4d0-e332-11ed-bcc7-05b24f88ca9c\" style=\"height: 1264px; width: 1982px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">DJI</div></figure><p>DJI has also improved the 7x (166mm equivalent) tele camera, boosting the aperture from f4.4 to f3.4, which should make it considerably better in low light.

It's a multi-faceted bill that's aimed at protecting consumers and encouraging competition, and it will allow the CMA to directly enforce the law instead of having to go through the court.&nbsp;</p><p>If the bill passes, the agency's Digital Markets Unit (DMU) will be able to enforce a set of rules on how companies it deems to have &quot;strategic market status&quot; in key digital services have to operate. The CMA didn't name any specific company in its announcement, but the DMU will most likely identify Google, Apple and Amazon as organizations with strategic market status.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The DMU could require them to be more transparent on how their app store review systems work or to open up their data to rivals \u2014 in Google's case, it could be a rival search engine. If these companies fail to abide by the new rules, the DMU could fine them up to 10 percent of their global turnover. Apple, for example, earned around $283 billion in revenue for 2022, so that could translate to a massive fine worth $28.3 billion.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to giving CMA the ability to set rules for tech giants, the new bill will also address the problem with &quot;subscription traps,&quot; which is costing UK consumers \u00a31.6 billion (US$2 billion) a year. Its new rules will require businesses, not just the biggest tech companies, to provide customers with clearer information before they start a subscription. Companies will also be required to send customers notifications if their free or low-cost trial is coming to an end and before their subscription auto-renews. Plus, companies will have to provide customers an easy way to unsubscribe. In the US, the Federal Trade Commission <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ftc-wants-to-make-it-easier-for-you-to-cancel-subscriptions-142649542.html\">proposed a similar rule</a> back in March that would make it as easy to cancel subscriptions as it is to sign up. The proposal is also still waiting for approval before it can be implemented.&nbsp;</p><p>Another concern the bill will address is fake reviews. The new rules are expected to prohibit companies from commissioning the composition and submission of fake reviews and from posting reviews without taking steps to ensure that they're genuine. Further, the rules would make it illegal to offer or to advertise submitting, commissioning and facilitating fake reviews.</p><p>Sarah Cardell, Chief Executive of the CMA, said in a statement:</p><p>&quot;The new powers in this bill help the CMA take swift, decisive action to tackle rip offs, protecting consumers whether they are shopping online or on the high street. The new fining powers will provide an important deterrent to businesses seeking to take advantage of people while also ensuring fair dealing businesses can thrive.&nbsp;</p><p>The bill will also strengthen the Digital Markets Unit, helping to ensure digital markets remain competitive and continue to benefit people, business, and the UK economy. We welcome its introduction to parliament and look forward to it progressing.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/uk-bill-could-protect-consumers-from-subscription-traps-and-fake-reviews-095558923.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/uk-bill-could-protect-consumers-from-subscription-traps-and-fake-reviews-095558923.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-25 09:55:58+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Opera One is a browser designed for generative AI features", "description": "<p>Opera has <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5vcGVyYS5jb20iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImQ1YmEyYjJiLTIzOTgtNDFjYS05Y2NjLTQ0OGU0NTRlNGI0YyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAfeqNZtXutdxHfUGP65GA336BHQS0GZpduA0N1CbrlPw&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.opera.com\">released</a> the early access version of its completely redesigned browser that it plans to launch for all platforms later this year. It's called Opera One, and it was designed to have a cleaner look with plenty of open space for future generative AI features and extensions in its sidebar and address bar. Opera says it has implemented a new multithreaded compositor and its new modular design principles for the browser to enable a fresh batch of features that include what it calls \"tab islands.\"</p><p>The browser has the capability to automatically and intuitively group websites people open based on their content. It will open all pages with menus and restaurant details in one island, for instance, and all tabs with Google Docs in another. The idea is to reduce confusion and make it easier to jump between tasks, whether for work or for something personal. Opera apparently conducted research and found that users get overwhelmed by the number of tabs they have and wish their browsers could do more for them. This is Opera's answer to that problem.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>While the browser was designed with the capability to create tab islands on its own, users can manually group pages together, as well. They can drag and drop tabs between islands or create a new one by pressing the CTRL or Command button and clicking on the websites they want to group before right clicking on the \"create a tab island\" option. Opera considers tab islands as the first manifestation if its modular design strategy with their clearly distinguishable island borders and color markets, so we could probably expect more similarly designed features.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to tab islands, Opera One comes with ChatGPT, ChatSonic and AI Prompts enabled by default. If you'll recall, the company <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/opera-adds-chatgpt-and-ai-prompts-into-its-browser-113500436.html\">introduced sidebar integration</a> for the AI chatbots back in March, allowing users to quickly launch them in a separate window within the browser. Meanwhile, the AI Prompts feature suggests different ways people can use the chatbots to transform the text on page, such turning a chunk of text into a soap opera dialogue or extracting information from it to create quiz questions.&nbsp;</p><p>Opera One is now available for download from the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5vcGVyYS5jb20iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImQ1YmEyYjJiLTIzOTgtNDFjYS05Y2NjLTQ0OGU0NTRlNGI0YyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAfeqNZtXutdxHfUGP65GA336BHQS0GZpduA0N1CbrlPw&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.opera.com\">company's website</a>.&nbsp;</p><div id=\"0cbeb7f6ce4942eab270738ddaaab731\"><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/opera-one-is-a-browser-designed-for-generative-ai-features-070048153.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/opera-one-is-a-browser-designed-for-generative-ai-features-070048153.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-25 07:00:48+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
