Then Musk came along, stripped people of their blue ticks, and said they\u2019d only get the badge back if they paid up. Obviously only a complete loser would do that and the blue tick quickly became a scarlet letter. So when the checks mysteriously reappeared on the accounts of a number of high-profile \u2013 and very much alive \u2013 figures, including the author Stephen King and basketball star LeBron James, said figures swiftly announced that they hadn\u2019t paid for the badge and wouldn\u2019t be caught dead doing so.

My former teacher, Jean-Paul S\u00e9villa, was once playing Bach\u2019s Goldberg Variations when, at the end of Variation 7, he couldn\u2019t remember how Variation 8 began. By the time he got off stage to find his score it came to him, but his evening was ruined. Then there was Vlado Perlemuter who, upon leaving home to go to the concert hall, was asked by his wife if he had forgotten anything. A friend in attendance jokingly said: \u201cThe beginning of the concerto!\u201d When, a few hours later, Vlado walked on stage in Paris to perform Beethoven\u2019s Fourth Piano Concerto (which famously begins with a quiet piano solo), he couldn\u2019t find the notes. My own turn came when I was 50 years old, playing Bach\u2019s Well-Tempered Clavier (all four and a half hours of it) from memory in Stuttgart. It was part of a world tour in which I played that mammoth work 56 times in 26 countries. That night, however, I went wrong in the big A minor fugue from Book 1 and couldn\u2019t find my way out. I had to go and get the score. You feel so ashamed \u2013 but we\u2019re only human, and sometimes it happens.</p><p>On the whole, I\u2019ve been blessed with an excellent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/memory\">memory</a> \u2013 I suppose some would even say prodigious as I\u2019ve performed the complete solo keyboard works of Bach (the exception being The Art of Fugue), the 32 sonatas of Beethoven, and who knows how many millions of other notes from memory over the years. I always thought it would have been a good idea to measure my brain before I memorised all that Bach and then again after to see how it had developed and changed. Too late now. At the age of 64, it\u2019s definitely shrinking, and memorising has become a very conscious, frustrating and time-consuming activity. But I stick at it because memory is a muscle that needs to be constantly used to stay in any sort of shape.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/25/angela-hewitt-pianist-memory-muscle\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/25/angela-hewitt-pianist-memory-muscle", "date_published": "2023-04-25 09:00:33+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "\u2018I feel I was raped\u2019: six women in Barcelona seek justice after relationship with \u2018spy cop\u2019", "description": "<p>Legal challenge also takes aim at Spain\u2019s home ministry after police officer allegedly posed as anarchist </p><p>The first time he showed up at Barcelona\u2019s poster-plastered La Cin\u00e8tika \u2013 a former cinema turned squatted anticapitalist social centre \u2013 was in mid-2020.</p><p>Friendly, funny and flirtatious, he introduced himself as Dani, a recent transplant to the city who was scraping by installing air conditioners, and said he had stumbled across the centre after searching online for a cheap place to work out.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/25/women-barcelona-relationship-with-spy-cop-spain\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/25/women-barcelona-relationship-with-spy-cop-spain", "date_published": "2023-04-25 09:00:32+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "\u2018I have an invisible disability myself\u2019: Edward Enninful and Sin\u00e9ad Burke on their fashion revolution", "description": "<p>How do you shake up a homogenous industry?
