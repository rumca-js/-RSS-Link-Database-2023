So Tucker has left Fox News, to the obvious glee of the other networks. But are they actually any better? And is this a further sign of the MSM collapsing before our eyes?

On Today’s Stay Free we’re talking about Biden’s announcement to run for president again in 2024 – do the claims Biden makes in his campaign video stack up against his track record so far?

In Here’s The News we’ll be taking a closer look at Tucker Carlson’s departure from Fox. If that’s not enough we’ve got a conversation with Breaking Points, Saagar Enjeti. Tucker was Saagar’s first boss in television so he’s sure to have the latest inside scoop!

Lastly, join up to our Locals community to take part in today’s polls which we’ll be discussing exclusively on our Locals livestream straight after the main show.
