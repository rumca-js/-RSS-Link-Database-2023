Hello and welcome to TUESDAY NEWSDAY! Your NUMBER ONE RESOURCE FOR THE ENTIRE WEEK'S WORTH OF VR NEWS!

Today we have a ton of fun update, from Quest V53 to more information on The Valve Deckard.. We'll also go deep into Meta's inner workings.. all the good and all the best from Quest 2 retention to employees getting laid off. The bigger point here that I'm really excited to talk about.. is; what happens when VR games become "too real".

Lets talk about it.
