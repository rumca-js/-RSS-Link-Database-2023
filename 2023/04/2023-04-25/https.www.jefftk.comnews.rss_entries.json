What you're\nactually able to observe, however, are <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/sequencing-intro\">sequencing reads</a>, several steps removed\nfrom infection rates.  Can we use covid data to estimate how the\nfraction of people currently infected with some pathogen might\ntranslate into the fraction of wastewater sequencing reads that match\nthe pathogen?\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nIn that post I looked at a single pathogen (SARS-CoV-2) in a single\nmetagenomic sequencing dataset (<a href=\"https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/AEM.01448-21\">Rothman\net al 2021</a>) and got a very rough point estimate (2.3e-8 relative\nabundance at 0.1% prevalence).  What fraction of sequencing reads\nmight come from a novel pathogen at some level of prevalence continues\nto be a key question, however, and this quarter I'm working with\nseveral other people at the <a href=\"https://www.naobservatory.org/\">NAO</a> in trying to get a\nbetter understanding here.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nSpecifically, we'd like to understand how relative abundance (fraction\nof sequencing reads matching an organism) varies with of prevalence\n(what fraction of people are currently infected) and organism (ex:\nsince we're sampling wastewater you'd expect disproportionately more\ngastrointestinal than blood pathogens).\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nHere's the current plan:\n\n</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li><p>Gather wastewater metagenomic sequencing data, mostly by\nlooking at papers that published it in the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra\">Sequencing Read Archive</a>.\nI'd love it if we could also include our own data here, but we aren't\nfar enough along to have much yet.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>Process the sequencing data (<a href=\"https://github.com/naobservatory/mgs-pipeline\">code</a>) to\nclean it (remove adapters, trim low-quality bases, collapse paired-end\nreads) and identify the reads (assign them to taxonomic nodes).\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>Gather corresponding estimates for the prevalence of various\nhuman viruses in the populations contributing to the metagenomic\ndata. (<a href=\"https://github.com/naobservatory/p2ra\">code</a>)\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>Build and fit a model for relative abundance as a function of\nprevalence, sequencing method, and the type of organism.\n\n</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nOverall, this would be a big step forwards towards estimating the\nfeasibility of this kind of detection: cost should be inversely\nproportional to relative abundance.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nWe're reasonably far along on (1) and (2), and if you're curious you\ncan <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/mgs-counts/\">poke around</a>.\nThat shows the counts for human-infecting viruses across samples.\nIt's rough (ex: <a href=\"https://github.com/naobservatory/mgs-pipeline/issues/3\">we're\nnot</a> doing any correction for PCR duplication yet) so don't\ntake it too seriously and <a href=\"https://github.com/naobservatory/mgs-pipeline/issues/new\">let us\nknow</a> if you see something suspicious.  On (3) and (4) things are\nmuch earlier: we currently have prevalence estimates for <a href=\"https://github.com/naobservatory/p2ra/tree/main/pathogens\">five\nviruses</a> and I'd like to get at least ten times this many.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n(If you're curious why I haven't been talking more about writing a\nbook since my <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/write-a-book\">post</a> a month ago, this is\na lot of it.  Right around when I posted that I moved from mostly\ndoing individual work to leading this project, and the opportunity\ncost of taking time away became much higher.  I do still want to write\nsomething summarizing the advice I got from people around making a\nbook, though, and it's possible I'll come back to the book project.)\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<br />\n\n<i>This post describes in-progress work at the <a href=\"https://www.naobservatory.org/\">NAO</a> and covers work from a\nteam including <a href=\"https://www.simongrimm.com/\">Simon Grimm</a>\nand Asher Parker-Sartori estimating prevalences, <a href=\"https://dp-rice.github.io/\">Dan Rice</a> modeling,\nWill Bradshaw evaluating sequencing methods, and <a href=\"https://mikemc.cc/\">Mike McLaren</a> identifying relevant\npapers and providing general technical guidance.</i>\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid0eAHxY6d22qrzxRaZo65GmyZyUYsT7jZEDShzXLZVHoNmFdt3nX5m5qmk64iLP9tHl\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://lesswrong.com/posts/TJ5KsfmE8q7FLd85v\">lesswrong</a>, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/QhZPrN2kkFv4S3YSg\">the EA Forum</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@jefftk/110261139518910726\">mastodon</a></i></p>", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/prevalence-to-relative-abundance", "date_published": "2023-04-25 08:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
