On today's Daily Fix:
Deep Silver and Dambuster Studios announced that Dead Island 2 has sold over 1 million copies within the first three days of release. Hardcore mode has been a time-honored Diablo tradition going back to Diablo II, challenging players with the possibility of permanent death. But what happens if your Hardcore character happens to stumble into one of Diablo IV's Fields of Hatred? Well, watch your back. Finally, Diablo 4 associate game director Joseph Piepiora has revealed that it will take over 150 hours to grind to level 100 in the upcoming action role playing game.

## Why Picard’s Story Had to End This Way (ft. Terry Matalas) | Star Trek

“People were like, ‘It must be the most emotional experience to bring them on set!’ It was like, ‘No, it was terrifying!’”

Picard Season 3 showrunner Terry Matalas may have been terrified when he reunited the crew of the USS Enterprise-D onboard the USS Enterprise-D, rebuilding the iconic starship’s bridge for just two days of actual filming for the Star Trek finale. But that was only part of the process when it came to telling the final Jean-Luc Picard story, a tale that began with the launch of Star Trek: The Next Generation 35 years ago, but that’s, seemingly now, finally over as the third and final season’s tenth episode, “The Last Generation,” hits.

It turns out that there was only one way that Jean-Luc’s story could close out as far as Matalas was concerned. But it wasn’t always an easy road to get there. 

Matalas has made no secret of being a lifelong Star Trek fan. His professional credits go as far back as Star Trek: Voyager and Star Trek: Enterprise, so the fact that he would have strong feelings on how Picard’s journey should wrap up is no surprise. And besides, what fan wants to kill off their heroes anyway?

As he notes, the Picard finale is a surprise ending because it's a happy ending. Does Picard live or die? What happens to Riker, Beverly, Worf, Geordi, Data and Troi? What about the crew of the USS Titan, Seven of Nine and Sidney La Forge? Jack Crusher?

Watch the full video for how the last Picard story happened…

## Tron: Identity Review

Tron: Identity fills a void that’s been empty since the Tron world debuted in Kingdom Hearts II almost 20 years ago. After multiple playthroughs, however, it’s still not clear what the story means for the greater Tron canon. Identity feels more like a first chapter than a standalone story, which may very well be the case, but you might find yourself yearning for more of a resolution in the short term. Identity may be more about the journey than the destination, but Query’s night at the Repository is still well worth playing.

Check out the new trailer for The Flash, an upcoming movie starring Ezra Miller, Sasha Calle, Michael Shannon, Ron Livingston, Maribel Verdú, Kiersey Clemons, Antje Traue, and Michael Keaton.

Worlds collide in The Flash when Barry uses his superpowers to travel back in time in order to change the events of the past. But when his attempt to save his family inadvertently alters the future, Barry becomes trapped in a reality in which General Zod has returned, threatening annihilation, and there are no Super Heroes to turn to. That is, unless Barry can coax a very different Batman out of retirement and rescue an imprisoned Kryptonian… albeit not the one he’s looking for. Ultimately, to save the world that he is in and return to the future that he knows, Barry’s only hope is to race for his life. But will making the ultimate sacrifice be enough to reset the universe? 

The Flash is produced by Barbara Muschietti and Michael Disco. The screenplay is by Christina Hodson, with a screen story by John Francis Daley & Jonathan Goldstein, and Joby Harold, based on characters from DC. The executive producers are Toby Emmerich, Walter Hamada, Galen Vaisman, and Marianne Jenkins.

The Flash, directed by Andy Muschietti, opens in theaters in North America on June 16, 2023 and internationally beginning June 14, 2023.

David Oyelowo's character establishes what Silo is about in this exclusive look at the new Apple TV+ sci-fi series.

Silo is the story of the last ten thousand people on earth, their mile-deep home protecting them from the toxic and deadly world outside. However, no one knows when or why the silo was built and any who try to find out face fatal consequences. Ferguson stars as Juliette, an engineer, who seeks answers about a loved one's murder and tumbles onto a mystery that goes far deeper than she could have ever imagined, leading her to discover that if the lies don't kill you, the truth will.
Based on Hugh Howey’s New York Times bestselling trilogy of dystopian novels, Silo stars an ensemble cast led by Rebecca Ferguson, who also serves as an executive producer. Silo is created by Emmy-nominated screenwriter Graham Yost (Band of Brothers, Justified), who also serves as showrunner. Academy Award-nominee Morten Tyldum (Defending Jacob, The Imitation Game) directs the first three episodes. The 10-episode series will premiere globally on Apple TV+ on Friday, May 5, 2023, with the first two episodes, followed by one new episode weekly, every Friday through June 30, 2023.

The ensemble cast starring alongside Ferguson includes Common, Harriet Walter, Chinaza Uche, Avi Nash, David Oyelowo, Rashida Jones, and Tim Robbins.

Silo is produced for Apple TV+ by AMC Studios and is based on the novels by Hugh Howey. The series is executive produced by Yost, Howey, Tyldum, and Ferguson alongside Nina Jack, Fred Golan, Rémi Aubuchon, and Ingrid Escajeda.
