Hardcore mode has been a time-honored Diablo tradition going back to Diablo II, challenging players with the possibility of permanent death. But what happens if your Hardcore character happens to stumble into one of Diablo IV's Fields of Hatred? Well, watch your back. Finally,\u00a0Diablo 4\u00a0associate game director Joseph Piepiora has revealed that it will take over 150 hours to grind to level 100 in the upcoming action role playing game.\n\n#IGN #Gaming", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZuwHnQs-VI", "date_published": "2023-04-25 23:23:35+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Why Picard\u2019s Story Had to End This Way (ft.

But that was only part of the process when it came to telling the final Jean-Luc Picard story, a tale that began with the launch of Star Trek: The Next Generation 35 years ago, but that\u2019s, seemingly now, finally over as the third and final season\u2019s tenth episode, \u201cThe Last Generation,\u201d hits.\n\nIt turns out that there was only one way that Jean-Luc\u2019s story could close out as far as Matalas was concerned. But it wasn\u2019t always an easy road to get there.\u00a0\n\nMatalas has made no secret of being a lifelong Star Trek fan. His professional credits go as far back as Star Trek: Voyager and Star Trek: Enterprise, so the fact that he would have strong feelings on how Picard\u2019s journey should wrap up is no surprise. And besides, what fan wants to kill off their heroes anyway?\n\nAs he notes, the Picard finale is a surprise ending because it's a happy ending. Does Picard live or die? What happens to Riker, Beverly, Worf, Geordi, Data and Troi? What about the crew of the USS Titan, Seven of Nine and Sidney La Forge? Jack Crusher?\n\nWatch the full video for how the last Picard story happened\u2026\n\n#IGN #StarTrek #Paramount", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkpOt_dC0rs", "date_published": "2023-04-25 23:00:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Diablo 4: The 7 Things We Want to See Return", "description": "Diablo 4 is almost here and after a few betas we have some thoughts on features, classes and more things we'd like to see return from past Diablo games in time for Diablo 4's June 6 release date on PC.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #Diablo", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qBpxL_GQOQ", "date_published": "2023-04-25 22:00:03+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Diablo 4 - Official Necromancer Trailer", "description": "For some, death is only the beginning.
