He was the million-selling artist whose easy and sensuous musical stylings and lighter-skinned image made him acceptable to white audiences. But this didn\u2019t stop him having a fierce screen presence and an even fiercer commitment to civil rights. He was the friend and comrade of Paul Robeson and Martin Luther King Jr \u2013 and his crossover success, incidentally, never stopped him being subject to the ugliest kind of bigotry from racists who saw his fame as a kind of infiltration. His legendary Banana Boat Song with its keening and much-spoofed call-and-response chorus \u201cDay \u2013 O!\u201d is actually about the brutal night shift loading bananas on to ships, part of an exploitative trade with its roots in empire.<br /><br />His friend and rival Sidney Poitier (there is room for debate in exactly how friendly their rivalry really was) may have outpaced him in the contest to become Hollywood\u2019s first black American star, being perhaps able to project gravitas more naturally and reassuringly. But Belafonte, for all his emollient proto-pop performances on vinyl, was arguably more naturally passionate. Crucially, his great movie breakthrough was with an all-black cast (though with the white director Otto Preminger) in Carmen Jones. In this 1954 film, Belafonte built on the screen chemistry he had had with the sensational star Dorothy Dandridge in their previous film together, Bright Road (a high school movie with Belafonte as the school\u2019s headteacher, anticipating Poitier\u2019s Blackboard Jungle and To Sir, With Love).<br /><br />Three years later, in Robert Rossen\u2019s Island in the Sun \u2013 adapted from the novel by Alec Waugh, brother of Evelyn \u2013 Belafonte sang the catchy, dreamy title song but had a spikier dramatic role as the up-and-coming trade unionist in the fictional West Indian island, confronting the white colonial ruling class. Again, Belafonte was cast with the much-loved Dandridge but his implied dangerous liaison is with a white woman, played by Joan Fontaine, connected with the family that runs the plantation. This was the sexual suggestion that had the film pulled from most movie theatres in the US south.</p><p>Coming at the end of the 1950s, Robert Wise\u2019s Odds Against Tomorrow was that rarest of things: a noir starring a black man. Belafonte was Ingram, the club singer with crippling debts who is inveigled into helping rob a bank, alongside a hardbitten professional criminal and racist, the role taken by veteran player Robert Ryan. It was a pairing to savour, Belafonte participating in the white/black crime duo that Hollywood often found expedient when it came to accommodating a black character in a contemporary US context. Belafonte\u2019s casting as a singer in the story has a potency and style.<br /><br />But perhaps Belafonte\u2019s strangest but most distinctive role came in the 1959 post-apocalyptic sci-fi fantasy The World, The Flesh and The Devil in which he is Burton, the mining engineer trapped miles below the surface of the earth after a calamitous cave-in. But he has escaped the effects of an atomic catastrophe and when he finally scrambles to the surface, Burton finds that he is apparently the only human left alive \u2013 except for one white woman and one white man, with whom he finally has a surreal but gripping contest for the woman\u2019s affections.<br /><br />And so Belafonte finds himself in a rather daring political what-if movie: an apocalypse is the only way to make acceptable the idea of interracial love, and yet even here racism and white male paranoia rears its head. Making this the scenario for sexual rivalry is somehow inspired although the resolution is a little tame. In some ways, the futurist movie anticipated his role opposite John Travolta in the race-reverse fantasy White Man\u2019s Burden from Japanese film-maker Desmond Nakano, in which Belafonte is the plutocrat with a privileged position in an anti-white world and Travolta is the white factory worker who gets in trouble through accidentally seeing the boss\u2019s wife in a state of undress \u2013 a bizarre but shrewd satirical touch.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/25/harry-belafonte-staggering-screen-career-sci-fi-love-triangle\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/25/harry-belafonte-staggering-screen-career-sci-fi-love-triangle", "date_published": "2023-04-25 16:54:45+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "Seth Meyers on Tucker Carlson\u2019s firing: \u2018Fox really knows how to disappear someone\u2019", "description": "<p>Late-night hosts react to Fox News\u2019 surprise firing of Carlson a week after it settled the Dominion defamation lawsuit</p><p>After news that Fox News <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/apr/24/tucker-carlson-leaving-fox-news\">abruptly terminated Tucker Carlson\u2019s contract</a> sent shockwaves through US politics and media on Monday morning, Seth Meyers looked ahead to a cable news landscape without his frequent target. \u201cWhat are we going to do without Tucker?\u201d the Late Night host wondered on Monday evening. \u201cWho else is going to <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-sexy-green-mandm-vs-tucker-carlson-drama-explained\">tell us when M&amp;Ms aren\u2019t fuckable any more?</a>\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/apr/25/late-night-recap-seth-meyers-tucker-carlson\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/apr/25/late-night-recap-seth-meyers-tucker-carlson", "date_published": "2023-04-25 15:05:14+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "Football Daily | A comedic tour de force, extravagant even by Tottenham\u2019s historical standards", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2022/nov/14/football-daily-email-sign-up\">Sign up now!
