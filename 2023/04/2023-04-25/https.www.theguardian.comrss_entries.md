<p>Through startlingly poetic memoirs and intimate footage of a woman discovering her grandmother’s incredible life, this documentary delivers a gut punch of a story</p><p>A middle-aged woman hovers anxiously in her idyllic French farmhouse kitchen, its table strewn with reams of yellowing papers. Among them is her grandmother’s diary: an account of her imprisonment in Nazi concentration camps, first Ravensbrück, a female-only camp in Germany, and later Mauthausen in Austria. For 20 years, Sylvie Bianchi has been gathering the strength to read these pages. Now, she is finally ready to face this account of the horrors her grandmother survived.</p><p>The diary tells of how Nelly Mousset-Vos – an opera singer who Bianchi later discovers worked for a Belgian resistance network (she was not Jewish) – was arrested in Paris in 1943; “torn away from this world”. Her poeticism is startling: when it snows, the barbed wire encircling the camp appears to be “dusted with powdered sugar”. After spending five days in a cattle wagon packed so tightly with others that she cannot move, leaving her trapped amid the putrid stench of dysentery, she arrives at the “antechamber to hell” and falls asleep on the floor.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/25/nelly-and-nadine-ravensbruck-1944-storyville-review-a-radical-tale-of-lesbian-love-in-a-concentration-camp">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Aston Villa returned to winning ways against Fulham to extend their unbeaten run to 10 matches and fuel their hopes of staging a spectacular finish to the campaign. Perhaps the biggest compliment to pay Villa is that, while this game did not pan out as comfortable as they would have hoped, they never really looked like conceding, let alone losing.</p><p>Quite where Villa’s incredible journey this season goes from here with five games to play remains to be seen but their unexpected and extraordinary gallop towards a top-six finish continues to gather pace. For the first time since September 1998, they have won five straight league games at Villa Park. Fulham’s season, meanwhile, appears to be petering out after so much early promise. Next up? The visit of champions Manchester City.

<p>The government must do its bit to make new electric vehicles more affordable if mass adoption is to be achieved on the road to net zero</p><p>When the government controversially <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/consumer/uk-government-axes-plug-car-grant-immediate-effect" title="">scrapped</a> its discount on the purchase of electric cars last summer, the move was justified on the grounds that its work was done.

As Britain strives to meet a 2030 target to end the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles, that judgment is beginning to look a little complacent.</p><p>Amid ongoing economic headwinds, data has emerged that suggests a drop-off in current demand for electric cars, despite notable public <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/articles/overhalfofyoungerdriverslikelytoswitchtoelectricinnextdecade/2021-10-25" title="">enthusiasm</a> for their adoption in principle.

<p>After years of devastating conflict, the UN sees an opportunity to end the war. But the risks of deterioration remain</p><p>Hope has been hard to find in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/yemen" title="">Yemen</a>.

Yet, since the agreement of a truce between the Saudi-led military coalition and Iran-backed Houthi rebels <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/01/yemens-warring-sides-accept-two-month-truce-starting-in-ramadan" title="">last April</a>, the country has seen a year of relative calm.

<p>Here in Marston, Oxford, buses are scarce and unreliable, and the imposition of low-traffic neighbourhoods feels like a punishment, writes <strong>Joanna Bagniewska</strong></p><p>As an ecologist and a keen cyclist who has never owned a car, I should, in theory, be overjoyed by the introduction of low-traffic neighbourhoods to my city (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/17/what-prompted-u-turn-low-traffic-neighbourhoods-laurence-fox" title="">What prompted my U-turn on LTNs? I realised I was on the same side as Laurence Fox, 17 April</a>). In practice, my experiences with this innovation have been trying.</p><p>I live in Marston, a part of Oxford hit by all the inconveniences of LTNs and none of the benefits. Following the introduction of LTNs in Cowley, the main route across the city (from London Road to St Clement’s) became unbelievably congested. This has had an impact on public transport – coaches from London are being rerouted each afternoon (which previously only took place in case of an accident). If you’ve left your bike near one bus stop in the morning, chances are you’ll have to walk across town to pick it up on your way back. Two bus services from Marston to the city centre have been reduced to just one, at half the frequency – after all, what’s the point in having a more frequent service if the vehicles stand in traffic anyway? And since buses became unreliable, fewer people use them, leading to further cuts.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/25/ltn-can-only-work-with-decent-public-transport">Continue reading...</a>

<p>If its true that William took a payoff from Murdoch and the royals struck a peace deal, they seem willing to surrender reputations cheaply</p><p>Prince Harry has long alleged that the royal family – “the Institution”, as he calls it – is locked in a trap of appeasement with the tabloid media. In their Netflix documentary, both he and Meghan talked about how they were savaged by the redtops, while the palace made no attempt to curtail their racist insinuations. In his memoir Spare, and interviews around it, Harry accused Camilla of leaking stories about him in order to massage her own reputation. Last month, in papers filed to the high court as part of his case against News Group Newspapers, who publish the Sun, he said that the royal family had struck a secret deal with the paper, that the Institution wouldn’t sue; indeed, it would never mention the phone-hacking scandal, since its abiding priority was to keep royals off the witness stand.</p><p>But claims made by Harry in court documents<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/25/prince-william-murdoch-phone-hacking-claims-court-filings-prince-harry">this week go even further</a>: that in 2020, Prince William was paid a “very large sum of money” by Rupert Murdoch to settle a phone-hacking case out of court.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/25/prince-harry-press-royals-william-murdoch">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Democrats don’t need to be especially good – because the Republicans are cruelly and chaotically worse</p><p>It’s not surprising, but now it’s official: Joe Biden is running for re-election. In a video on Tuesday launching his bid for a second term, Biden cast his administration as standing for personal freedom, democracy and pluralism in contrast to what he called “Maga extremists”. The video emphasized abortion rights and contrasted Biden and the Democrats with unsettling images of the Capitol insurrectionists. Echoing a repeated line from his most recent State of the Union address, the president implored Americans: “Let’s finish the job.”</p><p>There will be no primary. True, Biden has disaffected some members of the Democratic party’s precariously large coalition, and he has failed to capture the hearts and imaginations of Americans the way that, say, Barack Obama did. In 2020, a basketball team’s worth of Democrats entered the presidential primary – partly out of perceptions of then president Trump’s weakness, but also partly because Biden seemed like such a poor fit to be the party’s standard-bearer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/25/biden-2024-campaign-weak-republicans">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘I’m doing what may be my last paintings’: Frank Auerbach on his new self-portraits and turning 92

<p>He has painted the same people over and over, sometimes for 40 years, dabbing, rubbing out, then starting again. Although the great artist now has to hold on to his easel to work, he still hopes to die with a brush in his hand</p><p></p><p></p><p>Frank Auerbach once said that London after the second world war was a “marvellous landscape with precipice and mountain and crags, full of drama”. It’s a description that could just as easily apply to his own aged face, judging by the works that have just gone on display at a new show in the city.</p><p>Entitled Twenty Self-Portraits and showing at the Hazlitt Holland-Hibbert gallery, the exhibition comprises paintings on boards and drawings on paper, all done since 2017. Here he is looking like a bird; there, like a tree; there, a boulder unmoved by a storm. The artist, just turning 92, still lives where he works, as he always has done – alone in a north London studio. I call him at 9am on Good Friday. He picks up on the first ring.For decades, writers have struggled to find the right words to describe Auerbach: a hermit, a recluse, a monk, an obsessive. His daily routine seemed like it would never change: up before 7am to draw in quiet streets, then work in the studio – every day of the year – with one of the handful of people who have sat for him over the decades. As one veteran sitter, the art historian Catherine Lampert, puts it: “He’s all by himself, every evening, by choice.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/25/frank-auerbach-artist-self-portraits-last-paintings">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Abby Ryder Fortson and Rachel McAdams are remarkable in a thoughtful and funny expansion of the 1970s teen novel</p><p>For all our snap-bracelet readiness to embrace girl power and its concomitant hashtags (#yougotthis!), depictions of preadolescents that are worthy of their subjects are thin on the ground. Perhaps because most tweens will just “watch up” anyway, big entertainment has slouched into a comfortable stance of pumping out cutesy kids’ content and edgy fare about high school, without bothering to give much thought to the beautifully messy middle ground.</p><p>Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret, writer-director Kelly Fremon Craig’s entry to the woefully underserved category of period dramas (make of that what you will), is destined to become a classic. Based on – but not entirely wedded to – Judy Blume’s seminal 1970 novel of the same name, the film is an entertaining comedy that also happens to be a stunning evocation of the fear and yearning that come with standing on the precipice of adulthood.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/25/are-you-there-god-its-me-margaret-movie-review-judy-blume-rachel-mcadams">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Having read the actor’s bizarre and enthralling memoir, I couldn’t miss his livestreamed talk on ‘the art of livin’’. It didn’t disappoint – until the twist at the end</p><p>Two and a half years ago, I read <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/greenlights-9781472280831">Greenlights by Matthew McConaughey</a>. Billed as the actor’s life story and “guide to livin’”, it is one of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/26/greenlights-matthew-mcconaugheys-guide-to-life-livin-hollywood-star">wildest books</a> I have ever read. Over 300 pages, McConaughey recounts his trials (runner-up in Little Mr Texas, 1977; receding hairline) and takeaways from the desert and the Chateau Marmont hotel in Los Angeles.</p><p>It is hugely entertaining, with McConaughey’s voice as distinctive on the page as it is on screen. But his guiding philosophy of “chasin’ greenlights” (signs from the universe to steam ahead) struck me as about as relatable as his abs. After all, this was a man who <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2020/10/matthew-mcconaughey-greenlights-interview.html">followed an ambiguous wet dream to two continents</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/25/look-the-monster-in-the-eye-11-things-i-learned-from-matthew-mcconaughey-last-night">Continue reading...</a>

## Every time a SpaceX rocket explodes, I wonder if we should tax the rich more | Francine Prose

<p>The enormous expense of these rockets could have been spent on addressing the many crises that we face on our fragile planet</p><p>One strong argument in favor of heavily taxing the super-rich is that billionaires so often seem to have profoundly misguided ideas about how to spend their money. They waste it on solid gold toilets, or – like the Sacklers and the Russian oligarchs supporting Putin’s war – they use it to do harm. Most commonly, they fund wildly expensive vanity projects that gratify their egos while solidifying their position as masters of the universe who are socially, economically and physically insulated from the rest of us.</p><p>Among the most ambitious and widely publicized of these programs is the space station, SpaceX, that Elon Musk has built in Texas’s Rio Grande Valley, not far from the Mexican border. Musk founded Space Exploration technologies in 2002. His stated aim is to produce rocket ships capable of transporting a hundred passengers and large amounts of supplies and equipment into outer space – to explore the moon and eventually, Musk hopes, to colonize Mars. The first Falcon 1 rockets were tested in 2006. Twenty-six rockets have been launched in 2023 alone.</p><p>Francine Prose is a former president of Pen American Center and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/25/spacex-rocket-explodes-elon-musk-billionaires-tax-the-rich">Continue reading...</a>

## Freeze sliced bread and fry banana skins: Max La Manna’s quick guide to reducing food waste

<p>Step away from that bin and consider new ways of using up old bread, leafy greens, fruit and milk</p><p>What would you do with an extra £730? That’s the amount the average UK household wastes each year, by throwing away untouched or unopened food, according to the <a href="https://wrap.org.uk/sites/default/files/2021-10/food-%20surplus-and-%20waste-in-the-%20uk-key-facts-oct-21.pdf">waste and sustainability charity Wrap</a>. That’s a staggering 2m tonnes and the equivalent of roughly one in every three bags of groceries we bring into our homes. Food waste is not only bad for our pockets, it’s bad for the environment, too: 36m tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions could be saved if we stopped throwing it into landfill. Storing ingredients properly to keep them fresher for longer, planning mealtimes and getting creative with leftovers are three simple ways with which we can reduce our food-waste footprint. Let’s start with the UK’s five most-wasted ingredients.</p><p><strong>Bread </strong>We chuck<strong> </strong>out about<strong> </strong>20m slices of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/apr/30/how-to-turn-stale-rye-bread-into-porridge-recipe-zero-waste-cooking-ollebrod">bread</a> every day. I always store half my fresh loaves in the freezer, sliced and wrapped tightly. Revive a stale loaf by sprinkling with a little water, placing on a lined baking sheet and into a low oven for a few minutes (or in the microwave in 30-second blasts). Alternatively, turn it into breadcrumbs (or do like the Italians and make <em>pangrattato</em>), use to thicken soups, such as <em>pappa al pomodoro</em> (Tuscan bread and tomato soup), ribollita and gazpacho, or use instead of pine nuts in a pesto; they’re the secret to thicker sauces, too.</p><p>You Can Cook This!: Simple, Satisfying, Sustainable Veg Recipes, by Max La Manna, is published by Ebury Press at £22.

<p>Just as SpaceX’s Starship experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly this month, Musk is a mess, too, thanks to Twitter’s blue ticks</p><p>Elon Musk is a man of many talents including, it would seem, resurrecting people from the dead. Over the weekend, a number of notable but <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattnovak/2023/04/22/15-dead-celebrities-elon-musk-has-branded-with-twitters-controversial-checkmark/">no-longer-alive figures</a>, including Anthony Bourdain, Hugo Chávez and Jamal Khashoggi had “blue checkmarks” suddenly appear on their dormant Twitter accounts. When you clicked on the checkmark you were informed that they’d provided their phone numbers to the platform and agreed to pay $8 a month to subscribe to Twitter Blue. The afterlife must be dire if people are signing up for Twitter’s paid features from beyond the grave.</p><p>It wasn’t just dead celebs being mysteriously verified. The rollout of Twitter Blue was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/21/elon-musk-twitter-blue-rollout">a spectacular mess</a>. Once upon a time, having a blue tick by your name was a status symbol: a sign someone at Twitter HQ thought you were “notable” enough to verify. (Reader, I was not.) Then Musk came along, stripped people of their blue ticks, and said they’d only get the badge back if they paid up. Obviously only a complete loser would do that and the blue tick quickly became a scarlet letter. So when the checks mysteriously reappeared on the accounts of a number of high-profile – and very much alive – figures, including the author Stephen King and basketball star LeBron James, said figures swiftly announced that they hadn’t paid for the badge and wouldn’t be caught dead doing so. All of which would be incredibly embarrassing for Musk if he had any sense of shame.

<p>Long static shots of Slovenian mountains combine with ambient drones in this abstract, contemplative film that contemplates nature’s patterns</p><p>Here is a meditative documentary from Dutch film-maker Joke Olthaar that mostly consists of monochrome, long-held static shots, exquisitely filmed by cinematographer André Schreuders, of the mountains in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglav_National_Park">Triglav National Park</a> in Slovenia. It opens and closes with some airy voiceover musings about the abyss, solitude and all that jazz, and there are references to “the three of us” which chime with the three tiny, black, human-shaped blobs seen from time to time.</p><p>But for the most part, there is no palpable story or shape to the film. Olthaar occasionally mixes in what looks like Super 8 footage of climbers and walkers pictured on a more human scale, and at one point a dead body is dug out of the snow. Yet none of that human activity is given any more weight than the shots of handsome goats hanging out on the crags, or the shifting patterns of sun and shadow flickering across the vast spaces.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/25/berg-review-mesmeric-nature-documentary-slovenia-mountains">Continue reading...</a>

<p>We need to shine a spotlight on the acquisition of such basics as housing, schools and water networks</p><p>Asset managers are key figures in your life, although you may not be aware of it. These investment firms are mostly recognised for their ownership of financial assets such as stocks and bonds. But as well as owning financial assets, in recent decades they have been buying huge volumes of so-called “real assets”, which in many cases represent necessities of everyday life such as housing, schools, care homes, roads, energy systems, farmland and water-supply networks.</p><p>Thus, the regular payments to asset owners that we make to stay alive and thrive – such as for shelter, electricity, water or food – increasingly end up in part or in full in the hands of asset managers. Those managers decide both how much we pay, and what condition the apartment, care home or pipes that supply our drinking water are in.</p><p>Brett Christophers is a professor in the Institute for Housing and Urban Research at Sweden’s Uppsala University and author of Our Lives in Their Portfolios: Why Asset Managers Own the World</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

## ‘Like sex and religion, we don’t like to talk about memory’: pianist Angela Hewitt on how she keeps hers in shape

<p>From eavesdropping to iPads and beetles to Bach, the pianist reflects on the extraordinary feats of memory required of concert soloists, and how she continues to exercise that muscle</p><p>It happens to all pianists at some point: that terrifying moment when you’re on stage and can’t remember what comes next. My former teacher, Jean-Paul Sévilla, was once playing Bach’s Goldberg Variations when, at the end of Variation 7, he couldn’t remember how Variation 8 began. By the time he got off stage to find his score it came to him, but his evening was ruined. Then there was Vlado Perlemuter who, upon leaving home to go to the concert hall, was asked by his wife if he had forgotten anything. A friend in attendance jokingly said: “The beginning of the concerto!” When, a few hours later, Vlado walked on stage in Paris to perform Beethoven’s Fourth Piano Concerto (which famously begins with a quiet piano solo), he couldn’t find the notes. My own turn came when I was 50 years old, playing Bach’s Well-Tempered Clavier (all four and a half hours of it) from memory in Stuttgart. It was part of a world tour in which I played that mammoth work 56 times in 26 countries. That night, however, I went wrong in the big A minor fugue from Book 1 and couldn’t find my way out. I had to go and get the score. You feel so ashamed – but we’re only human, and sometimes it happens.</p><p>On the whole, I’ve been blessed with an excellent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/memory">memory</a> – I suppose some would even say prodigious as I’ve performed the complete solo keyboard works of Bach (the exception being The Art of Fugue), the 32 sonatas of Beethoven, and who knows how many millions of other notes from memory over the years. I always thought it would have been a good idea to measure my brain before I memorised all that Bach and then again after to see how it had developed and changed. Too late now. At the age of 64, it’s definitely shrinking, and memorising has become a very conscious, frustrating and time-consuming activity. But I stick at it because memory is a muscle that needs to be constantly used to stay in any sort of shape.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/25/angela-hewitt-pianist-memory-muscle">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Opposition day motion could push Tory MPs into a politically embarrassing vote on sewage ahead of local elections</p><p>Good morning. Water quality used to be a niche concern for environmentalists, rather than a mainstream political issue. But that is changed in recent years, as people have become increasingly angry about water companies continue to allow sewage to be discharged into rivers, and today Labour will seek to exploit that by challenging Tory MPs to vote down a bill that would do something about this.</p><p>Today has been set aside for opposition day debates – Commons debates on a Labour motion. Normally these are used for declarative motions (“This house believes that the government is rubbish …” etc) and the government often tells its MPs to abstain, because nothing happens if the motion passes. But increasingly Labour is using these slots to debate procedural motions, that would have an effect if passed, and the government cannot ignore these without consequence.</p><p>It is clear that we have a Tory government that has run out of ideas, only regurgitating old announcements that do nothing to end sewage dumping. That is why Labour has brought forward legislation to clean up our water system.</p><p>Today, Tory MPs have an opportunity to support Labour’s water quality bill which will put an end to sewage dumping once and for all. Their constituents will be watching to see if they will put the best interests of our country before their party.</p><p>This vote will be judgment day for Conservative MPs on the sewage crisis plaguing our coastlines and rivers.</p><p>Conservative MPs have spent the past year blocking tough new laws on water companies. They are trying to take the British public for fools with tough talk and no action.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/apr/25/labour-conservatives-vote-down-sewage-bill-keir-starmer-rishi-sunak-uk-politics-live">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Adventure film follows Max Stainton, who has cerebral palsy, as he battles expectations and great physical pain to reach the Everest base camp</p><p>Financial analyst Max Stainton has cerebral palsy and is a wheelchair user – “Give me a maths problem, I’ll be fine. Don’t ask me to put on my shirt,” he quips – and director Carl Woods, in his debut documentary, follows Stainton on a two-week charity trek to Everest base camp on horseback. Horse riding is incredibly demanding physically for Stainton, and this film is not only a fly-on-the-wall adventure doc, but an insight into the frustrations of being disabled and constantly dealing with other people’s stereotypes and assumptions.</p><p>It begins at home in London where Stainton lives with his partner, Candy. Giggling, they describe meeting when she was hired as his PA, and they fancied each other like mad. (“Inappropriate!”) Stainton explains that, with the trek, what he wants is to challenge society’s perceptions, the pigeonholing of him as that guy in a wheelchair. “TRAIN TRAIN TRAIN” says a sticker on the fridge. So, he does endless crunches with his physiotherapist, and walks up and down the stairs in his block of flats.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/25/my-everest-review-disabled-mans-himalayan-trek-is-the-toughest-of-challenges">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Anxiety and depression have severely affected my libido, and I am facing the prospect of a sexless marriage</p><p><strong>My husband and I are in our </strong><strong>30s and have been together for nine years, with no children. </strong><strong>I had severe anxiety and depression a couple of years ago, </strong><strong>which I continue to struggle with</strong><strong>. </strong><strong>As a result I’ve always struggled with sex. I’ve never felt that sexual and although I love my husband very much – he’s a very kind, caring</strong><strong> and patient man – I know sex is</strong><strong> important to him. I enjoy intimacy such as kissing and cuddling, but we </strong><strong>haven’t had sex for </strong><strong>more than seven months and the last time we tried I had a panic attack. </strong><strong>We’ve been communicating with each other </strong><strong>about how to get through this and what could be the issue, but have no idea how to proceed</strong><strong>. At the ages of 33 and 34 we are facing </strong><strong>the prospect (I believe) of a sexless marriage. I know deep down </strong><strong>this is torture for him and I would rather let him go than have him face the rest of his life in a sexless relationship.</strong></p><p>Anxiety and depression can significantly lower one’s sexual desire, and some of the medications used to treat them can negatively affect various aspects of one’s sexual response. It is vital that you speak about your sexual challenges to whoever is treating your mood disorder. Do not underestimate the seriousness of having a panic attack during attempted sex. You deserve to have the treatments that will help you become psychologically and sexually healthy, so advocate strongly for your own healing.

<p>This timely and important study of investment zones exposes the limitations of the experiments favoured by free-market fanatics</p><p>Remember Liz Truss’s plan last summer to carpet-bomb Britain with investment zones? These were not just freeports – these would be zones modelled on the most anarchic capitalist zones in the world. There would be no tiresome planning laws, no irksome regulations, minimal labour laws, little taxation and only the lightest veneer of democracy. For Truss and her chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, these would be the ultra-libertarian battering rams to ignite the capitalism flame – covering almost every city and town in the country.</p><p>The idea did not survive their passing: Truss wanted an uncapped number, while even Kwarteng accepted the Treasury argument that the loss of tax revenue – estimated to be £12bn – if the government went full Truss was unacceptable. There had to be some limit, otherwise there would simply be a mass diversion of economic activity into the “investment zones” and little extra investment. It was a fool’s mission. The present chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, laid the whole plan quietly to rest, while persevering with a softer and mildly less mad version of the same idea – freeports.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/25/crack-up-capitalism-by-quinn-slobodian-review-market-radicals-and-dream-of-world-without-demoracy-the-economic-anarchy-of-liz-truss-dreams">Continue reading...</a>

<p>If the idea of ‘talking dirty’ to your partner fills you with dread, you are not alone. From voice notes to using keywords, here’s the best advice for the tongue-tied</p><p>The best sex I’ve ever had was with a man with superb oral skills. He could talk about sex so intoxicatingly I ended up moving in with him – and I’m still with him to this day. Expressing your desires with words is an art, while technology – voicenotes, texts, emails, and calls – offers a multitude of ways to communicate more compellingly than actual nudes.</p><p>According to a UK poll by condom brand Durex, one in five sexually active women and one in four men find sexting uncomfortable, or would never do it. To that end, it’s important to understand that some words might excite one person but turn off another. “My partner told me never to use the word ‘damp’ when talking dirty,” a friend, James, 43, tells me. The wrong word can do more than spoil a mood, it can be triggering, cause offence or even trauma. Due to the influence of porn, it can be easy to assume that erotic talk can involve humiliation, when in fact using “whore” or “slut” are simply degrading.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/25/how-to-do-pillow-talk-well">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Inventive hybrid uses drama and archive video montage to examine the intersections of different liberation struggles</p><p>Here is a 1986 film co-directed by radical feminist film-maker Maureen Blackwood with artist-director Isaac Julien. Their sensibilities are a fruitful match here, creating a knotty, complex, self-questioning piece of work: drama, essay movie and video art crossover. Blackwood and Julien were drawing on the black power radicalism of the 60s and the feminism of the 80s in ways that could amount to a British new wave.</p><p>In a stylised wilderness, a male and female figure confront each other ill-temperedly: the woman accusing the man of not allowing women any agency or space within the liberation movement. In a parallel realist drama, a family deals with racist abuse (often from off-duty police) and their own ideological and generational splits on the subject of injustice and empowerment, and how gay people of colour find themselves marginalised by the community from which they are hoping for support.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/25/the-passion-of-remembrance-review-absorbing-fusion-of-black-radicalism-and-feminism">Continue reading...</a>

Three decades later, she reflects on how the trauma changed her</p><p>Annette Herfkens and her fiance, Willem van der Pas, had been together for 13 years when he booked them on to a flight from Ho Chi Minh City to the Vietnamese coast. After six months of working in different countries, it was meant to be a romantic break. Van der Pas was a banker, Herfkens a trader. The plane was tiny, just 25 passengers and six crew. Being claustrophobic, Herfkens initially refused to board. To placate her, Van der Pas – “Pasje” as he was to her – fibbed that it was only a 20-minute flight. But 40 minutes had gone by when the plane dropped sharply. Van der Pas looked at her. “<em>This</em> I don’t like,” he said nervously. The plane dropped again. He grabbed her hand – and everything went black.</p><p>When Herfkens came to, the sounds of the Vietnamese jungle were coming through a jagged hole in the fuselage. The plane had crashed into a mountain ridge. A stranger lay dead upon her. Pasje, a little way off, lay back in his seat, also dead, a smile upon his lips.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/25/how-we-survive-i-was-the-sole-survivor-of-a-plane-crash">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This year’s Mother art prize pays tribute to the joy, fury and hilarity of having kids – even the opening night was gatecrashed by toddlers</p><p>I’m standing in front of Sea, a large-scale installation by <a href="https://jodiecarey.com/">Jodie Carey</a> commissioned for <a href="https://foundlingmuseum.org.uk/">London’s Foundling Museum</a>. It was inspired by the tokens that mothers left, along with their children, at the Foundling hospital, Britain’s first home for children at risk of abandonment, in order that they should be able to one day identify and claim back their offspring. Sea is formed of hundreds of swatches of fabric dipped in liquid clay and fired to create fragile, pale textured fragments where the original material has burned away. The effect of these fragments – the shells, essentially, of the maternal comfort objects belonging to some of history’s invisible children – is startlingly moving.</p><p>On Mother’s Day I had gone to the Foundling Museum and seen some of the tokens for myself, and learned how rare it was that a woman came back for her baby. Sea pays tribute to these babies and the impoverished mothers who could not keep them.

<p>Fox News has unexpectedly announced that Tucker Carlson, the network's most popular and controversial presenter, had departed from the channel. The network said it had mutually agreed with Carlson to part ways. The decision to oust Carlson reportedly came from Rupert Murdoch, the 92-year-old Fox owner, with input from senior Fox officials. It was connected to a lawsuit filed by Abby Grossberg, a former senior booking producer on Carlson’s show who claims she faced sexism and a hostile work environment, the Los Angeles Times reported. It comes less than a week after Fox settled a defamation lawsuit with Dominion Voting Systems for $787.5m. </p><p></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/apr/24/tucker-carlson-leaving-fox-news">Tucker Carlson leaves Fox News in surprise announcement</a></p><p></p></li></ul> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2023/apr/24/far-right-host-tucker-carlson-leaves-fox-news-in-surprise-announcement-video-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The former deputy prime minister may have resigned but he remains defiant after an inquiry into bullying allegations. What does the scandal tell us about the relationship between ministers and Whitehall?</p><p>Supporters insist he is robust, expects the very best – and will even concede that he is demanding. But after an inquiry into eight complaints, involving 24 people and spanning four years, found Dominic Raab’s conduct in some instances “involved an abuse or misuse of power in a way that undermines or humiliates”, the former justice secretary resigned. Yet he has not gone quietly, defiantly insisting that the report by Adam Tolley KC sets a “dangerous precedent” by lowering the threshold for what is considered bullying.</p><p>Raab has blamed instead “activist civil servants” who could not cope with being told that their work was not up to the standard he expected. And he says he worries that it “will be the public that pay the price” if politicians can not do that without being accused of bullying behaviour.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/apr/25/bullying-politician-or-snowflake-civil-servants-downfall-dominic-raab-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
