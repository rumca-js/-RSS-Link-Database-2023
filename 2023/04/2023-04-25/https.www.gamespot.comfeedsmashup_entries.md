<p>Blizzard has released its first-ever community-made map in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/">Overwatch 2</a>, available now across all platforms. The news comes from the official Overwatch Twitter account, as the team has revealed that the map will be playable in the game's Arcade suite of modes.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">Your ideas üí°<br />Your design ‚úçÔ∏è<br />Your creation ü§©<br />Introducing Talantis, the first-ever community-made map üåäüêü<br />Live now in the Arcade ‚ú® <a href="https://t.co/7RcAoD4S2e">pic.twitter.com/7RcAoD4S2e</a></p>  ‚Äî Overwatch (@PlayOverwatch) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1650937107014352896?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">April 25, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">In the tweet, a video is shown off, and we're given a good look at the map. From what was seen, it's clear that Talantis is an underwater-themed map with giant fish swimming around the edges. It has a unique visual style not normally seen in the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Talantis is a 5v5 map that plays similarly to other Overwatch 2 maps, with each team being tasked with taking control of the center. Players can take a lift to get to the objective. The first team to capture the objective twice wins the match, and all three rounds are played in the same location. </p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-gets-its-first-community-made-map-talantis/1100-6513573/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Just like The Fast and the Furious, DC's Blue Beetle will be about family. Director Angel Manuel Soto and star Xolo Maridue√±a appeared at a CinemaCon panel to promote the movie, while also hyping up the superhero's suit.</p><p dir="ltr">Soto and Maridue√±a, who plays the eponymous superhero Jaime Reyes, mentioned the suit is basically a young nerd's fantasy. This was teased <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blue-beetle-trailer-takes-xolo-mariduena-to-new-heights-as-dcu-hero/1100-6512909/">in the first trailer for Blue Beetle</a>, where the suit says, "Whatever you can imagine, I can create." Reyes then conjures up a gigantic sword that rivals Cloud's from Final Fantasy VII.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Soto wanted to instill how important family is to this DC film, the first to star a Latino hero. He mentioned how the Reyes family is there when the scarab chooses Jaime and gives him his superpowers, for instance. Maridue√±a added that Jaime doesn't even want his superpowers at first. But through his family, he finds his strength as the hero.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blue-beetle-is-a-unique-origin-story-focusing-on-family-says-director/1100-6513555/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>It's been an excruciating wait for Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom since the shockingly great first movie stole our hearts during the holiday season of 2018. But the end of this tunnel is finally approaching, and director James Wan showed off the first trailer for the upcoming blockbuster at CinemaCon on Tuesday. And it had very little Amber Heard in it.</p><p>While Wan wasn't there in person, he did have a video message for the CinemaCon audience of theater owners and members of the press, saying the second Aquaman movie has everything we loved about the first movie and more, and that it's "an action-hero story with a really good bromance at its heart."</p><p>That new, budding bromance is between Aquaman (Jason Momoa) and his half-brother Orm (Patrick Wilson), who ruled Atlantis with an iron fist in the first movie before being defeated by Aquaman first in battle and then in single combat.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-aquaman-and-the-lost-kingdom-cinemacon-trailer-mostly-skips-amber-heard/1100-6513564/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Timothee Chalamet has assumed his rightful place as Muad‚ÄôDib, the prophet of the Fremen in the first trailer for Denis Villeneuve's Dune: Part Two. 2021's Dune was another adaption of Frank Hubert's Dune book series, one that proved to be extremely successful. It was one of the year's top 10 films and nominated for 10 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, winning six.</p><p>"We really see Paul Atreides become a leader here," Chalamet said during Warner Bros. presentation during CinemaCon. He was joined by Villeneuve and co-star, Zendaya.</p><p>"She's not just in dreams this time," Zendaya said of her character, Chani. "I only got such a small time to get to know who she was and now I really feel like she's a part of myself. These are still just two young people trying to grow up and fall in love and live."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-2-cinemacon-footage-shows-timothee-chalamet-riding-the-worm/1100-6513554/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## The Mageseeker: A League Of Legends Story Review - Magic In The Air

<p dir="ltr">After a decade of resting solely on the laurels of its hit MOBA, Riot Games's decision to expand the lore of the ultra-popular League of Legends and its war chest of playable Champions will likely go down as one of the company's best moves. It's already given us Ruined King and the Netflix show Arcane, and it will soon give us Song of Nunu, Convergence, and the fighter Project L. The Mageseeker: A League Of Legends Story is the next expansion of LoL's lore, and it keeps Riot's momentum going with great combat, a beautiful world, and a riveting (though admittedly slow-starting) story.</p><p dir="ltr">The Mageseeker follows Sylas, a mage living in Demecia, a city that persecutes magic wielders through a special task force called Mageseekers. Sylas has the ability to absorb the magic of other mages, which makes him one of the most powerful magic users in the world. Before he discovered his power, Sylas was a Mageseeker himself, and during one of his assignments, he took pity on one of the mages he was seeking out. However, his innate ability kicked in, and his inability to control the magic he unknowingly absorbed from his quarry resulted in the deaths of multiple innocents. Despite his service to the Mageseekers, the discovery of his own power led to his imprisonment for 15 years. Now he is out and he is seeking revenge on those who sent him away.</p><p dir="ltr">The aesthetic choices in The Mageseeker are immediately impressive. The minimalist pixel art on display is a far cry from the state-of-the-art graphics modern consoles are capable of--heck, it's even a stark departure from the game's source material. However, the way developer Digital Sun tells a story through this art style, whether it's the backdrop of a scene or subtle movements in characters both playable and not, is remarkable.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-mageseeker-a-league-of-legends-story-review-magic-in-the-air/1900-6418059/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## The Biggest Game Releases Of May 2023

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4128347-maygamesheader.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Let's be honest, you're just here to make sure The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is on this list. Yes, it very much is, and while Nintendo's sequel to 2017's Breath of the Wild is looking to be a license to print money for the company, May also has plenty of <em>other </em>games to look forward to if you don't have a Switch. As we near the halfway point of the year, May has a handful of highly anticipated releases, indie games, and a few niche titles to offer, most of which are looking to avoid a Hyrule-themed bullet from Nintendo.</p><p dir="ltr">The biggest competitor to Link's new adventure is probably Redfall, Arkane Austin's co-op FPS that features high stakes, wooden stakes, bloodsucking ghouls, and a city under siege from a legion of Vampires. While it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/redfall-will-not-have-60fps-mode-at-launch-on-xbox/1100-6513192/">won't be running at a silky smooth 60fps at launch</a>--that'll come later--the game is still shaping up to be a colorful and interesting sandbox that mixes classic vampire lore with Arkane's unique talent for worldbuilding.</p><p>Later in the month, you can get your hands on a pair of spooky horror games. Amnesia: The Bunker is a first-person horror game set in a desolate WW1 Bunker and will keep you on the edge of your seat with homicidal terrors lurking in the dark.<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outlast-trials-isnt-what-you-expect-but-that-might-be-a-good-thing/1100-6508876/"> The Outlast Trials isn't the game that you're expecting it to be</a>, but this new chapter from developer Red Barrels does mix a co-op-friendly design with some spine-tingling frights.</p><p dir="ltr">For something more relaxing, check out Lego 2K Drive later in May. An open-world Lego racing game, the key selling point of this game is the option to construct your very own custom vehicles to use in events across the sandbox. This includes a high-powered "Hamburghini" to burn rubber with. No, really.</p><p dir="ltr">Other highlights for May include The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, in which the Hobbit formerly known as Smeagol gets a solo adventure, and Humanity, a human-herding game in which players guide mobs of people across dangerous terrain. Lastly, there's TT Isle of Man: Ride on the Edge 3, a new chapter in which you can grab a superbike and explore the UK island at a relaxing and dangerous pace. It's two-wheeled tourism at a blistering speed.</p><p dir="ltr">To see what else is arriving this year, you can check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2023-upcoming-games-release-schedule/1100-6508202/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1682092608155950&amp;usg=AOvVaw3WHZKWV3UzsThfyxJm_3qX">2023 video game release schedule</a>.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Redfall - May 2</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4128335-redfall.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>A small town under siege, vampires treating the populace like an all-you-can-drink buffet, and ancient gods awoken from their slumber by CEOs looking to become immortal. Who ya gonna call? In Redfall, it's up to four unique individuals to save the day, each one wielding distinct skills that happen to be perfectly suited for turning vampires into dust. Between an eclectic arsenal, telekinetic powers, and sharpshooting talents, you'll be able to take on the vampire hordes with style. One of Microsoft's big two games for the year, Redfall is playable in either solo or cooperative mode on PC and Xbox Series X|S.</p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-100770772-13797872?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/redfall">Discounted at Fanatical</a> </div></div><p> </p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Redfall-Standard-Xbox-X/dp/B0BT3DSGSQ?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20">See at Amazon</a> </div></div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Age of Wonders 4 - May 2</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4128336-ageofwonders4.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>4X strategy meets turn-based tactical combat once again in the latest Age of Wonders chapter, as you'll enter familiar fantasy lands to save the people from tyrannical Wizard Kings who have become corrupted by their power. Age of Wonders 4 is aiming to be an endlessly replayable game, and combined with the empire-building, role-playing, and warfare of the series on top of a new storytelling event system and hugely customizable empires, it's shaping up to devour plenty of your time when it arrives this month.</p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-100770772-13797872?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/age-of-wonders-4">Discounted at Fanatical</a> </div></div><p> </p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1669000/Age_of_Wonders_4/">See at Steam</a> </div></div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Hogwarts Legacy - May 5</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4128337-hogwartslegacy.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>A controversial best-seller on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, Hogwarts Legacy is making a last-gen leap to PS4 and Xbox One this month.

Everything from stats to rules has been refined and improved for the sequel, but you'll need to juggle the wellbeing of your shell-shocked heroes between expeditions if you want to make it to the bitter end.</p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1940340/Darkest_Dungeon_II/">See at Steam</a> </div></div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>TT Isle Of Man: Ride On The Edge 3 - May 11</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4128339-ttisleofmanrideontheedge3.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The Isle of Man is one of <em>the </em>locations to visit if you're a fan of motorcycles, and once again, developer Raceward Studio is providing a digital alternative for anyone who can't get there in real life. Like previous entries in the series, TT Isle Of Man: Ride On The Edge 3 is all about twisting the throttle on a superbike and speeding through the scenic countryside of this iconic motorcycle racing circuit, as well as a few other tracks for good measure. All 264 bends of the 60km circuit, dozens of bikes to master, and authentic handling all combine to create a true-to-life experience that's stunning to look at.</p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/TT-Isle-Man-Ride-Edge/dp/B0BQYQ26SQ?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20">See at Amazon</a> </div></div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - May 12</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4126394-zelda-1.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Easily the biggest game that Nintendo will release this year, Tears of the Kingdom has some big shoes to fill. Six years after Breath of the Wild cemented its legacy as one of the greatest Zelda games of all time, Tears of the Kingdom is looking to build on that foundation with some fascinating ideas. Gameplay is being enhanced with new abilities that look to address the thorny issue of weapon durability, you'll be able to explore the land using vehicles built from scrap, and Ganon is dangerously <em>hot </em>now.</p><p><i>See our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-preorder-guide/1100-6492963/">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom preorder guide</a> for details on the special-edition Switch OLED, Amiibo, Switch Pro controller, and more.</i></p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://shop-links.co/1804467899655339473?u1=subid_value">See at Best Buy</a> </div></div><p> </p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Legend-Zelda-Breath-Wild-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B097B2YWFX?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20">See on Amazon</a> </div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Humanity - May 16</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4128340-humanity.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>There aren't enough games about taking control of a Shiba Inu dog and herding a massive mob of people to safety, but finally, Humanity is scratching that very specific itch. A blend of puzzle-solving and action-platforming, Humanity features gigantic swarms of people who are all headed for disaster unless you steer them out of harm's way. You'll be able to command people to jump, turn, push, float, shoot, and climb their way out of danger, and if you're looking for a more immersive experience, Humanity will also be available on several virtual reality platforms.</p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/233011">See at PlayStation Store</a> </div></div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Outlast Trials - May 18</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4128341-theoutlasttrials.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The Outlast series of survival-horror games have excelled within their genre, but The Outlast Trials is aiming to appeal to a new audience with its co-op focus. As one of several unlucky participants in the Murkoff maze of horrors, you'll need to work alongside your teammates to survive the terrors that lay within each level. Monstrous enemies lurk in the halls, one wrong move will quickly end your life, and fighting back isn't an option in this new take on the cult-classic series. Teamwork makes the dream work, but if you're not prepared to synergize with your fellow players, then get ready to experience a deadly nightmare when The Outlast Trials begin this month.</p><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1304930/The_Outlast_Trials/">See at Steam</a> </div></div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Lego 2K Drive - May 19</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4128342-lego2kdrive.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>There's a new name on the block when it comes to Lego, as 2K Games is putting a new spin on the popular Danish toys.

There may be more to the tragic ringbearer than meets the eye, and that's a story that Daedalic Entertainment is looking to tell in this Lord of the Rings spin-off. Taking place in parallel to the events described in The Fellowship of the Ring, Gollum's tale is one that requires cunning and stealth, as he sets off to reclaim his precious ring. You'll have to get past Orcs and be wary of Elves during his travels, but the choice is up to you when it comes to <em>how </em>you'll handle these threats.

## The Meg 2 Releases The Kraken In CinemaCon Footage

<p>2018's The Meg, starring Jason Statham, was one of the biggest movies of the year grossing over half a billion dollars worldwide. Based on the 1997 novel by Steve Alten, the film featured Statham as a rescue diver who encounters a colossal long-lost megalodon, a prehistoric shark: The Meg.</p><p>During Warner Bros.' presentation at Cinemacon, the studio showed the first trailer, which showed Statham is back as Jonas Taylor, and there are more sea monsters about to emerge for the sequel. There was a scene of a Meg eating a T-Rex. We also saw Taylor getting called in to help explore an ancient ecosystem where something is trying to make its way to the surface.</p><p>There's a quick look at Statham and his team in underwater mech suits, of course, attacked by things. There's also a shot of a giant Meg, the biggest anyone has ever seen. It builds to three Megs this time, along with some other prehistoric creatures, including what looked like a Kraken.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-meg-2-releases-the-kraken-in-cinemacon-footage/1100-6513553/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The Willy Wonka prequel, simply called Wonka, finally got its first trailer during the Warner Bros. presentation at this year's Cinemacon. The Timothee Chalamet-led film has been in the works since 2016, with Chalamet being cast in 2021. The film isn't a prequel to the Gene Wilder film, but the actual 1964 book by Roald Dahl.</p><p>The footage shown during the presentation had Wonka traveling the world perfecting his craft and saw the beginnings of his chocolate-making in his room. We saw a lot of his experiments, even making people float. Eventually, we get to the opening of his first chocolate shop.</p><p>"Mark my words, this is going to be the greatest chocolate shop the world has ever seen," Chalamet as Wonka said. We even saw an Oompa Loompa played by Hugh Grant. The design looks very similar to the Gene Wilder movie with orange skin and green hair.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wonka-footage-at-cinemacon-reveals-hugh-grants-oompa-loompa/1100-6513549/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>It remains to be seen whether Greta Gerwig's Barbie movie will end up being the cinematic event of the summer when it hits theaters in July. But judging by the footage that Warner Bros showed off at CinemaCon in Las Vegas on Tuesday, it's certainly in the running. That footage didn't just show us more cool Barbie Land stuff--we finally got our first look at the actual plot of the film.</p><p>Before they got to the clips, however, Gerwig and the cast of the film--including Margot Robbie (Barbie), Ryan Gosling (Ken)--came out onto the CinemaCon stage to talk about how much they loved making the movie.</p><p>"It was such an incredibly joyful experience writing and making this movie," Gerwig said. "When I was writing it with Noah [Baumbach], there was just a point where we were making each other laugh the whole time. Then when we got to the end we were making each other cry."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-barbie-footage-finally-reveals-the-plot-of-the-movie/1100-6513550/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Miyamoto Reacts To The Super Mario Bros. Movie Doing Huge Numbers And Bad Reviews

<p>The Super Mario Bros. Movie is on a path toward $1 billion at the global box office before it even opens in Nintendo's home country of Japan. What does Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto think of the huge success? He said <a href="https://www.ndw.jp/mario-interview-230425/">in an interview with Japanese press</a>, translated by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/shigeru-miyamoto-says-the-mario-movie-has-performed-better-than-he-couldve-imagined/">VGC</a>, that the animated movie's massive success surprised him, adding that the relatively low review scores from some professional critics might have helped generate additional buzz for the film.</p><p>"I did have a level of expectations that this movie would also do well [like the Super Nintendo World theme park], but I was very surprised that it went beyond what I could have imagined when it finally came out," Miyamoto, who is also a producer on the film, told press. "You need some luck to achieve this level of success for a film. While many foreign critics have given the movie relatively low ratings, I think that also contributed to the movie's notoriety and buzz."</p><p>Indeed, The Super Mario Bros. Movie carries just a <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_super_mario_bros_movie">59%</a> rating on Rotten Tomatoes and a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-super-mario-bros-movie">46</a> on GameSpot sister site Metacritic. But scores from audiences on both sites are much higher. The film also scored a highly coveted A rating on CinemaScore, which indicates that audiences really like it.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/miyamoto-reacts-to-the-super-mario-bros-movie-doing-huge-numbers-and-bad-reviews/1100-6513548/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## LOTR: Gollum Will Use Ray Tracing To Make That Disgusting Hobbit Look Even Greasier

<p>Next month will see the release of The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, a fresh retelling of the iconic character from J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy books. Like several other PC games, this adventure will allow for some impressive visual features if you have the right hardware, including Nvidia's fancy ray-tracing technology. This is a far cry from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYrJdAdi1WI&amp;ab_channel=PlayStation">2022 gameplay trailer</a>, which was met with criticism toward the graphical performance shortly before Nacon delayed the game.</p><p>While Gollum's journey across Middle-earth won't be giving <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-update-adds-new-mode-that-pretty-much-no-one-can-play/1100-6513144/">Cyberpunk 2077 and its path tracing</a> any sleepless nights, the sizzle reel posted by Nvidia does tease some good-looking atmospheric lighting, reflections, and unfortunately, a greasier Hobbit. Two out of three isn't bad, especially if the "hero" of your game has spent several centuries eating raw fish inside of a dank cave. The rest of the game is, fortunately, easier on the eyes than Gollum's filthy frame, and Nvidia has shown off how ray tracing enhances the experience in the trailer below.</p><div>          </div><p>PC gamers with GeForce RTX hardware will also benefit from Nvidia's DLSS 3 and DLSS 2 upscaling technology, allowing them to experience ray-traced reflections and shadows at the highest possible frame rates. As for the actual requirements, LOTR: Gollum has some fairly demanding GPU requirements even without enabling ray tracing.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lotr-gollum-will-use-ray-tracing-to-make-that-disgusting-hobbit-look-even-greasier/1100-6513547/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>A private company from Japan aiming to become the first non-government organization to land a spacecraft on the moon ran into issues at the last minute. A Japanese private company, ispace, blasted a rocket to the moon and its lunar lander was set to touch down today, April 25, at 12:40 PM ET, but flight controllers lost communication just "moments" before it should have landed.</p><p>According to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/moon-landing-spacecraft-japan-uae-555ec67e1150f8008b65243e3a6179d2?taid=6448090f3c6fd10001493f30&amp;utm_campaign=TrueAnthem&amp;utm_medium=AP&amp;utm_source=Twitter">The Associated Press</a>, the lunar lander--named Hakuto, the Japanese word for white rabbit--was just 33 feet away from the Moon's surface when flight controllers lost contact. The spacecraft was moving at a speed of about 16 mph.</p><p>"We have to assume that we did not complete the landing on the lunar surface," ispace founder Takeshi Hakamada is reported to have said during a webcast of the attempted landing.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/today-almost-saw-a-worlds-first-for-space-flight-to-the-moon-but-it-ended-in-heartbreak/1100-6513545/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Steam Deck has dominated the handheld PC market since launching in 2022. Its success seems to have inspired other major PC gaming companies to dive into the world of handhelds.

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a>'s Week 7 quests have been released, bringing a handful of new things to do on the island to earn some XP and additional cosmetic rewards from the battle pass. One of those fresh challenges asks you to light three campfires, which can slowly heal your health when standing near them. While you'll find a slew of campfires across the map, we've got the most efficient route for you to knock this quest out quickly.</p><h2>Where to light three bonfires in Fortnite</h2><p>Again, you can certainly find plenty of campfires strewn across Fortnite's massive map, but the quickest and most efficient way to knock the quest out is by landing at one of the campfires along the coast south of Frenzy Fields. This coastline has three campfires in a straight east-to-west line, meaning you can start at one side and rapidly work your way in the necessary direction to find and light all three with minimal time and effort.</p><figure style="width: 1024px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4129624-campfires.png"><img alt="These southern campfire locations make for the easiest route to claiming your challenge XP." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4129624-campfires.png" /></a><figcaption>These southern campfire locations make for the easiest route to claiming your challenge XP.</figcaption></figure><p>As you can see, these three campfires are very close to one another, so getting them all lit should take you under a minute or so--provided you don't run into trouble along the way. Your best bet is likely to land at the western one since it's slightly further from the other two--and also because moving to the east from this point provides a better rotation opportunity toward Mega City or Frenzy Fields. Either way, once you've lit these three campfires, you'll complete the Week 7 quest and be one step closer to some new cosmetics.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-where-to-light-three-campfires-easiest-method/1100-6513542/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Wizards Of The Coast Sends Pinkertons To YouTuber's House For Magic Cards

<p dir="ltr">Leaks are a ubiquitous part of gaming these days, but Magic The Gathering owner Wizards of the Coast has had a more aggressive response than most. The company apparently sent Pinkerton agents to retrieve unreleased Magic cards that a YouTuber recently showed off in a video.</p><p dir="ltr">According to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD9HRueI6Js">response video</a> by the YouTuber, Dan Cannon, the agents showed up at their house and frightened the content creator's wife. The agents then repossessed the cards and told Cannon to take the videos down. Cannon also told <a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-the-gathering-pinkerton-youtube-wotc-mtg-1850372856?rev=1682434450472">Kotaku</a> that the agents threatened them with jail time and up to $200,000 in fines if they did not cooperate, and that they wanted to search their entire collection of cards for stolen property. Wizards of the Coast confirmed to Kotaku and other outlets that the Pinkertons were employed as a part of its investigation.</p><p dir="ltr">Today, Pinkerton advertises itself as a security and risk management firm under the umbrella group Securitas AB. The firm is arguably better-known for the role it played in fighting against <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/who-were-the-pinkertons">organized labor</a> in the 19th and early 20th centuries, serving as a private law enforcement firm for Gilded Age industrialists who fought against unionization. A 2020 report from <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dp3yn/amazon-leaked-reports-expose-spying-warehouse-workers-labor-union-environmental-groups-social-movements">Motherboard</a> said that Amazon employed the firm to spy on its warehouse workers amid attempts to unionize. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-dd-world-is-on-fire-right-now-and-wizards-of-the-coast-can-only-blame-itself/1100-6510643/">Wizards of the Coast</a> came under fire when the company attempted to change the legal framework surrounding D&amp;D third-party content, and it was ultimately forced to abandon that action.</p>

<p>Video games are great for escapist entertainment, but they're even better for helping you flex your grey matter. Puzzle games are good for the mind, and if you're looking to get cerebrally swole, then the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/puzzle_matching?offset=48">Steam Puzzle Fest</a> is where you'll want to be.

Arguably the <em>best </em>version of Tetris thanks to its classic design and gorgeous visuals, it also incorporates a terrific soundtrack into the gameplay for pure synesthesia delight. Though more than a decade old, Portal 2 remains one of the best puzzle games around. This eternal tale of robots, lateral thinking, and non-existent cake is timeless, especially when it's on sale for a single buck.</p><p>Circling back to Tetris, Sega's quirky fusion of the classic puzzle game with Puyo Puyo makes for a vibrant and challenging test of your stacking skills, and this great sequel is just $7.50 on Steam. If you'd prefer something more sinister, check out Catherine: Classic. A mix of bizarre puzzle-platform action, anime, and the dangers of adultery, it's available at the bargain price of just $5.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steams-latest-big-sale-is-live-with-a-bunch-of-stellar-game-deals/1100-6513540/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">AMD Ryzen 7 CPUs have proven to be a big hit with PC gamers recently, but it looks like they may have a major issue that users need to watch out for. There have been several reports of AMD Ryzen 7000X3D CPUs burning themselves out over the past few weeks, and it's possible that a BIOS update will fix the issue.</p><div><blockquote class="reddit-embed-bq" style="height: 500px;"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12tlk7s/7800x3d_just_killed_itself_and_my_mobo/">7800X3D just killed itself and my mobo</a><br /> by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Speedrookie">u/Speedrookie</a> in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/">Amd</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">Redditor Speedrookie <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12tlk7s/comment/jhbfh8y/">posted</a> a few days ago that their 7000X3D CPU deformed in its socket, effectively destroying their motherboard in the process. After some back and forth with AMD, they were able to get the parts returned to the company and a replacement sent out. Speedrookie believes that the issue was caused by an older BIOS version that may have interacted poorly with the CPU's overclock profile, though that's really just speculation at this point. GameSpot has reached out to AMD for further clarification on this.</p><div>          </div><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">ASUS withdrew the old BIOS from many motherboardsüò≤ <a href="https://t.co/oaHoTR0YF8">pic.twitter.com/oaHoTR0YF8</a></p>  ‚Äî HXL (@9550pro) <a href="https://twitter.com/9550pro/status/1649621031588630529?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">April 22, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">It's worth noting that ASUS recently removed old BIOS versions from several motherboards, as shown by Twitter user @9550pro, but it's unclear if that's related. An overclocker and content creator named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVkTGq7brP4">der8auer</a> also had an issue with the 7000X3D burning out, though they was clocking it well above what most people would recommend.

<p dir="ltr">Battlefield 2042's <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/battlefield-2042-update-notes-4-2-0">update 4.2.0</a> is now live, and it includes a wide-ranging rework of the map Discarded, and it added some smaller changes. Those include a way to remove weapon attachments in the collections screen, a new end-of-round statistic, and better assist tracking.</p><p dir="ltr">Fans have been clamoring for the Discarded rework, as it aims to make the map more fun and engaging for the community. According to the blog post announcing the patch, the rework attempts to improve the infantry experience by adding new flags and paths. The map also includes several new areas strewn with cover for foot soldiers to use, including a salvage yard and a dismantled convoy.</p><p dir="ltr">Other changes include significant upgrades to the collections and customization menus, specifically improving the legibility of weapon and attachment swapping. The update also sets a feature called Uniform Soldier Aiming to "on," which is apparently a tool that helps your aiming movement to become more consistent over time. On a technical level, this means that your hip-fire aim sensitivity will be the same as your aim-down-sights sensitivity, which makes for consistent mouse or stick movements.

Part 2 of Season 3 follows four weeks later on July 27.</p><p>There will be eight episodes in total for Season 3 across the two "volumes," as Netflix calls them. Check out the new trailer below, which sets up some of the action and drama to come.</p><p>"When we wrote the season, we didn't have batching in mind," series creator and showrunner Lauren Hissrich said in a <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/the-witcher-season-3-sneak-peek">blog post</a>. "That said, for any fans who are familiar with The Time of Contempt novel, there's an epic event that explodes the Continent as we know it--the lead-up to which provided a perfect cliff-hanger for us.

## Destiny 2 Has A Lot Of Seasonal Story Backtracking For A (Mostly Technical Limitations) Reason

<p>Seasonal missions in Destiny 2 generally have a predictable cycle, as each weekly adventure involves bullets and backtracking. Typically, these missions will require players to head to several locations for a debriefing, usually with one of the main Destiny 2 characters at their usual location or through a holoprojector located in a different social hub. This has been a point of contention for some players, but as Bungie explained, this particular gameplay loop is necessary due to budgetary and technical constraints.</p><p>"There are logistical reasons why this happens. Sometimes it's how the quest was built as part of the overall gameplay loop and its incredibly hard after the fact to change it, such as in Season of the Forge where you had to visit Ada multiple times," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/12x7md5/comment/jhiowie/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb3x">Bungie explained on Reddit</a>. "Other times it‚Äôs due to time or budgetary constraints. Full vendor performances take up much more time and budget to create than an upper torso performance in the holoprojector or just a voice recording."</p><p>While several fans have complained about how Season of Defiance required jumping between the HELM and Farm social hubs for weekly chats with in-game characters, Bungie explained that this was done as both locations are important to the seasonal story and a technical issue related to the holoprojector. "The main reason is because certain performances are hooked up at each holoprojector and we can‚Äôt put them all in the same place without other issues occurring," Bungie said.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-has-a-lot-of-seasonal-story-backtracking-for-a-mostly-technical-limitations-reason/1100-6513527/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>After the latest portion of a long legal battle, Apple has come out on top over Fortnite developer Epic Games, with an appeals court siding with Apple on nine out of 10 claims.</p><p>"Today's decision reaffirms Apple's resounding victory in this case," an Apple spokesperson told <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/24/apple-declares-victory-after-decision-reached-in-epic-games-appeal-.html">CNBC</a> following the decision. "For the second time in two years, a federal court has ruled that Apple abides by antitrust laws at the state and federal levels."</p><p>The initial ruling came in a year and a half ago (check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-v-apple-trial-wrap-up-judge-makes-landmark-decision-in-massive-tech-case/1100-6490954/">our extensive coverage</a>), when California courts concluded that they could not prove that Apple was engaging in monopolistic behavior under federal or state laws. The trial did show, though, that "Apple is engaging in anticompetitive conduct under California's competition laws," according to the ruling.

<p>After almost a decade of development, Dead Island 2 has finally risen from development hell and is proving to be a big hit for developer Dambuster Studios. With the game out in the wild, the studio is now considering adding a New Game Plus mode to the sequel. Dead Island 2 design director Adam Duckett appeared on an <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/xboxon">XboxOn</a> stream this week to answer questions from fans, one of which was related to a potential New Game Plus mode.</p><p>"A few of you are asking about New Game Plus," a Dambuster Studios staff member explained in the Twitch stream chat (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/dead-island-2-devs-are-looking-into-new-game-plus/">GamesRadar</a>), taking over for Duckett. "This is being looked at by the development team, so keep an eye on the Dead Island 2 social channels for updates," the developer explained.</p><p>While Dambuster isn't outright confirming that this mode will be added in the future, it is encouraging to see that the possibility for it is being actively explored. Several studios have added New Game Plus long after the original game has shipped, with a notable example being God of War Ragnarok, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnaroks-new-game-plus-mode-is-available-now-offers-increased-level-cap/1100-6512992/">which received the mode in April</a> after releasing in November 2022.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-island-2-could-add-new-game-plus-devs-tease/1100-6513524/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Warner Bros. and DC's The Flash movie is finally arriving this June after many delays and news of its controversial star still doesn't have fans deterred from seeing it. The first trailer was released to overwhelming positive fanfare with footage of Michael Keaton suited up as Batman after 30 years and even co-head of DC Studios James Gunn praised the movie as one of the best comic book movies ever.</p><p>The Flash movie will have its world premiere this week at CinemaCon in Las Vegas, although with unfinished special effects. McFarlane Toys sent Gamespot its wave of Flash movie figures, but we wanted to concentrate on two figures in particular to give fans a close look: Ben Affleck's new Batman armor and the villainous Dark Flash. Outside of the brief clip in the trailer, we haven't gotten detailed looks at either of these yet so let's dive in.</p><figure style="width: 3072px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4129441-pxl_20230425_113238606.portrait.jpg"><img alt="New Batfleck armor.

In the trailer, there's a blueish hue to the cowl and bits of armor, but you can see that's toned down for the figure. In fact, there's no real blue at all, and is more of a gun-metal gray instead. The cowl has a different finish than the rest of the armor and isn't as reflective; it harkens back to his Dawn of Justice design.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mcfarlane-flash-toys-give-us-close-look-at-new-batman-armor-and-dark-flash/1100-6513529/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>2021's Ghostbusters: Afterlife left the door wide open for more ghosts to sneak in, as well as a sequel. While Sony Pictures didn't offer up any footage, they did share what look to be a new plot development for the upcoming film.</p><p>In lieu of footage of the film, stars Carrie Coon and Paul Rudd appeared in a video with director Jason Reitman and writer Gil Kenan alongside young Ghostbusters Finn Wolfhard and Mckenna Grace; the whole family, including Rudd and Coon, are suited up in the iconic khakis. The video describes them as a family, which suggests that Coon and Rudd's characters got hitched between the two movies after their spooky meet-cute in the first one.</p><p>Reitman and Co. were already talking about a sequel before Ghostbusters: Afterlife hit theaters. Keenan said that "there are lots of surprising ways that the future and past can grow together, side-by-side and separately" <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/there-are-already-plans-for-a-ghostbusters-afterlife-sequel-heres-what-we-know/1100-6498234/">at the time of Afterlife's release</a>.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/paul-rudd-and-carrie-coon-don-ghostbuster-suits-for-afterlife-sequel-tease/1100-6513520/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Sony continues to mine its many video game properties for screen adaptations, and CinemaCon attendees Monday night were treated at a look at the first trailer for the next one: Gran Turismo. </p><p>Stars Orlando Bloom and David Harbour were on hand during Sony's presentation of its upcoming movie slate, with Harbour joking that he didn't really understand what the Gran Turismo movie was at first: how do you make a movie out of a racing game with no story? "It's a racing simulator!<em>" </em>Harbour said he complained to director Neill Blomkamp.</p><p>Of course, the movie tells the true story of a teenaged Gran Turismo player who successfully managed to make the leap from gamer to real-life professional racer--it's a bit different from your standard video game movie adaptation.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gran-turismo-movie-trailer-reveals-david-harbours-gamer-boot-camp/1100-6513521/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Superhero movies are, almost always, PG-13 fare meant to appeal to the widest possible audience of kids and grown-up kids. A few notable exceptions, though, like Logan, Joker, and Deadpool, have sported an R rating. Spider-Man spin-off film Kraven the Hunter will join the ranks of R-rated superhero movies when it releases, Sony Pictures revealed Monday at CinemaCon 2023.</p><p>Alongside the MPA rating, we got a teaser for the movie. Game hunters at a wildlife preserve find themselves under attack, not by a lion, but by a man named Sergei Kravinoff--Kraven the Hunter. (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) There's stabbing, blood, and Kraven even bites the nose off of one of the hunters before spitting it at the camera. The whole thing feels inspired by John Wick's brutal but efficient action. Kraven closes a bear trap on a guy's face.</p><p>Kraven pulls his iconic furry chest piece out of a box, and we see Marvel villain The Rhino briefly, getting his rhinoceros skin as his arm begins to grow hide on it. Kraven is being positioned, like Venom, as an antihero. Kraven believes he murders for good, but someone tells him that despite thinking he has a code, he's just a guy looking for a trophy.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kraven-the-hunter-movie-is-rated-r-first-footage-debuts/1100-6513518/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

The film sports a star-studded cast including Paul Dano, Seth Rogen, Sebastian Stan, Shailene Woodley, Dane DeHaan, Anthony Ramos, America Ferrera, and Nick Offerman.</p><p>The footage Sony offered gave a good overview of the story. Gabe Plotkin (Seth Rogen), chief investment officer at Melvin Capital, is trying to buy the mansion next door to his--so that he can tear it down and build a tennis court--when he finds out about the GameStop stock's skyrocketing value. A variety of characters ,including a medical professional played by America Ferrera, all have wildly over-the-top reactions.</p><p>Ken Griffin (Nick Offerman), the CEO of hedge fund manager outfit Citadel LLC, calls Plotkin, revealing that the skyrocketing stock is due to a YouTuber named Roaring Kitty, real name Keith Gill (Paul Dano), who is sporting the same long hair as his real-life counterpart in this clip. Plotkin asks Griffin, "Who is this schmuck?"</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamestop-movie-dumb-money-shows-first-footage-at-cinemacon-2023/1100-6513517/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
