[{"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Opera shows off AI and tab grouping in the latest browser update", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Opera, which has established itself as a boutique browser vendor, has announced Opera One, a complete redesign of the browser that&rsquo;s been optimized for modular elements and AI-powered features like &ldquo;tab islands.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All told, Opera One has a slick new look, but with technical underpinnings that leave it open to adding new AI-powered capabilities in the future. Opera is also promising that a new &ldquo;multithreaded compositor&rdquo; will improve performance, so that Opera One takes advantage of the multicore capabilities of modern PCs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The browser is in early developer mode, according to Opera, and will be released later this year for Windows, MacOS and Linux.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When you think of AI, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1672975/the-best-ai-art-generators-for-you-midjourney-bing-and-more.html\">AI art generators</a> or chatbots like <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1424575/chatgpt-is-the-future-of-ai-chatbots.html\">ChatGPT </a>come to mind. But the flagship feature of Opera One is something called Tab Islands, which sounds like it could be extremely useful if it works as expected. Grouped tabs are nothing new, whether it&rsquo;s simply manually re-arranging the tabs yourself versus tucking them away in one of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/397408/heres-how-microsoft-collections-edges-new-research-tool-will-work.html\">Collections of Microsoft Edge</a>. What Opera One&rsquo;s Tab Islands does is group them using AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re searching for hotels, condominiums, plane flights, and things to do on a vacation, Opera&rsquo;s Tab Islands will automatically highlight and group those tabs for you. Each Tab Island will appear as a separate row or column of tabs, separate from the others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;In the new, reinvented version of Opera, Tab Islands are the first manifestation of its Modular Design: they are clearly distinguishable in the browser UI, marked by separate colors and clear island borders,&rdquo; Opera said.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Opera One Tab Islands\" class=\"wp-image-1798241\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Opera-One-Tab-Islands_Closeup.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>A closer look at what Opera&rsquo;s Tab Islands will look like.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Opera</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s the next element of what Opera is promising. A modular design that puts <em>less</em> in front of your face, not more. While browsers use sidebars and taskbars to help conceal some of the more complex elements of what the browser could show, it sounds like Opera&rsquo;s modular design will simply conceal the elements it doesn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll need, entirely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;As a result, the browser has a cleaner, decluttered look with plenty of space for future AI-based features and extensions in both the browser sidebar and address bar,&rdquo; Opera added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The current version of Opera already supports ChatGPT and the related ChatSonic AI content creation tool. The modular design will allow it to add more AI capabilities as they come to market. Under the hood, Opera One will act more like modern games and apps. All modern microprocessors include multiple cores and instruction threads, allowing them to do several things in parallel. Older apps have been single-threaded, performing one task, then another, but all in order. Opera&rsquo;s multithreaded compositor will allow it to split up tasks among your processor&rsquo;s cores and threads, improving overall performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Opera&rsquo;s pledging to deliver its own AI engine, potentially offering its own spin with what Microsoft has done <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1526807/hands-on-how-to-use-bing-chat-within-windows-11.html\">integrating Bing AI in Microsoft Edge</a> and what Google will do, presumably, with <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1504572/google-announces-bard-ai.html\">Bard</a>. <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1434315/operas-new-lucid-mode-makes-older-video-look-like-new.html\">Opera has already used AI intelligence to clean up video</a>, too. We don&rsquo;t know if that will all come together by the time Opera ships, helping it land in our list of <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407176/best-web-browsers.html\">the best Web browsers</a> and giving <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/798153/10-innovative-opera-features-that-lured-me-away-from-chrome.html\">one more reason to switch from Chrome to Opera</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\nPersonal Software</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1798217/opera-one-is-operas-ai-powered-modular-new-browser.html", "date_published": "2023-04-25 17:39:36+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Hands-on: The Asus Zenbook S 13 makes a case for a more practical ultraportable", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>When you go for the thinnest, lightest laptop you can, you make certain sacrifices. Take the darling of the category, the Dell XPS 13, for example. If you buy one, you <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/402858/the-best-usb-c-hubs-for-your-laptop-tablet-or-2-in-1.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">might as well buy a USB-C dock as well</a>, because two C ports are all you&rsquo;re getting for I/O. The latest Asus Zenbook is trying to buck that trend. The S 13 (UX5304 for the 2023 model) combines high-end specs, including a gorgeous OLED screen and a distinctive design, with enough ports to make you leave your dongles behind. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the left side of the laptop, you&rsquo;ll find two USB-C/Thunderbolt 4 ports, plus a full-sized HDMI 2.1 port, the latter of which is a hair&rsquo;s breadth from the bottom of the alloy chassis. On the other side, you get a standard USB-A 3.2 Gen 2 port (also scraping the side of the case) and a headphone jack. That might not sound like much if you&rsquo;re used to a more chunky model, but this laptop is just 10.9mm thin&mdash;thinner than my Pixel 7 phone. It&rsquo;s a surprising and very welcome mixture of practicality and appealing design. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Asus Zenbook S 13 ports\" class=\"wp-image-1796681\" height=\"614\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Zenbook-S-13-OLED_UX5304_Basalt-Gray_Basic_03.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>At just 10.9mm, the Zenbook S 13 still manages to pack USB-A, USB-C, full-sized HDMI, and headphone ports.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Asus</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of design, Asus was quick to highlight its new method of adorning the Zenbook with both color and texture. The magnesium-aluminum alloy body&rsquo;s lid has a rough but appealing stone-like texture on its graphic (which reminds me a bit of the Starfleet badge), created using what Asus calls &ldquo;plasma ceramic aluminum.&rdquo; In an alternative to the usual anodizing process, this finish has increased wear resistance and hardness with far fewer byproducts going into the environment. It&rsquo;s hard to describe how nice the lid is based on photos alone, but as someone who&rsquo;s sick to death of rubbing fingerprints off of his ThinkPad, trust me when I say it&rsquo;s extremely appealing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every part of the Zenbook S 13 is designed to be thinner and more compact, but razor-thinness isn&rsquo;t the only benefit. Thanks to fewer motherboard component layers and a rearrangement of the screen panel, there&rsquo;s room for a thicker battery and a new IR camera for Windows Hello. The screen is a 16:10 OLED panel at 2880&times;1800 resolution, which Asus says that this panel covers 100% of the DCI-P3 color gamut. It&rsquo;s also rocking 550 nits, surprisingly high for an OLED screen. On the other side of the case is a 63-watt hour battery (again, very impressive for the form factor) that Asus clocks at 14 hours of streaming video. It can also charge up to 70% capacity in 49 minutes. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Zenbook 13 S laptop lid\" class=\"wp-image-1796682\" height=\"676\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DSC00932.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>The Zenbook 13 S has a pleasing ceramic &ldquo;stone&rdquo; finish on the lid.&nbsp;</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>During my brief time using the laptop, the keyboard was a low point. Asus says that this, too, has been redesigned for more thinness and I could tell with very little key travel. It wasn&rsquo;t <em>bad</em>, just not as satisfying as other premium laptops I&rsquo;ve used. The touchpad was another matter. It features excellent texture with plenty of room and response. The hinge forces the keyboard deck up slightly, but can still lay flat at 180 degrees, which Asus seems particularly proud of. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The guts of the Zenbook S 13 are predictably high-end. The <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.asus.com/laptops/for-home/zenbook/asus-zenbook-s-13-oled-ux5304/&amp;xcust=2-3-1796668-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">sole configuration on the Asus store</a> uses a Core i7-1355U processor with Xe integrated graphics, 32GB of DDR5 memory, and a terabyte of PCIe. 4.0 NVMe storage.

A favorite for ultraportable laptops and <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1432716/sabrents-new-gen-4-ssd-is-perfectly-sized-for-your-steam-deck.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">gadgets like the Steam Deck</a>, these drives are still pretty thin on the ground for regular consumers. Corsair is trying to fix that with its latest SSD family, the MP600. Available in both a standard 2280 size for the Core XT and the sought-after 30mm-long 2230 for the Mini, both Gen 4 drives are on sale starting today from Corsair&rsquo;s website. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These drives are fairly typical for PCIe x4 NVMe, boasting a maximum read/write speed of 5GBps/4.4GBps for the larger MP600 Core XT and 4.8GBps/4.8GBps for the smaller MP600 Mini. 3D NAND stacking allows for standard capacities, 1/2/4 TB for the larger drive and just 1TB for the Mini. As with all M.2 drives, they&rsquo;re backwards compatible with Gen 3 motherboards, like the one in the Steam Deck. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite being new drives, these SSDs are benefitting from the rock-bottom prices in the general market as of late. You can get the 1TB, 2TB, and 4TB versions of the MP600 Core XT for <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.corsair.com/us/en/Categories/Products/Storage/M-2-SSDs/MP600-CORE-XT/p/CSSD-F4000GBMP600CXT&amp;xcust=2-3-1797883-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$60, $115, and $285</a>, respectively, while the 1TB MP 600 Mini is <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.corsair.com/us/en/Categories/Products/Storage/M-2-SSDs/MP600-MINI-PCIe-4-0-%28Gen-4%29-x4-NVMe-M-2-2230-SSD/p/CSSD-F1000GBMP600MN#tab-tech-specs&amp;xcust=2-3-1797883-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">a very reasonable $110</a>. </p>\n\nStorage</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1797883/corsairs-teeny-mp600-mini-ssd-is-ideal-for-the-steam-deck.html", "date_published": "2023-04-25 15:06:32+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "AMD Ryzen Z1 chips will power a new generation of PC gaming portables", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>It seems like the Steam Deck has dominated the PC gaming space for the last year, despite running on relatively old Zen 2 hardware. The fact that this brick-sized gadget can run the latest 3D PC games at all is pretty remarkable and a testament to the surprising versatility of AMD&rsquo;s APU designs. But what if the company built a new series of chips designed from the ground up for this new, super-compact portable form factor? It has. Say hello to the Ryzen Z1, which will make its <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1796614/hands-on-the-rog-ally-is-the-steam-deck-for-gamers-who-want-more-power-and-options.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">retail product debut in the Asus ROG Ally</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1127/amd-introduces-ryzen-z1-series-processors-expanding-the&amp;xcust=2-3-1797689-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Z1 and Z1 Extreme</a> are designed with the unique requirements of super-portable gaming in mind, optimizing both graphical capability and battery life over multitasking or CPU-focused tasks. Both are based on the Zen 4 architecture of AMD&rsquo;s latest desktop and laptop chips with the RDNA 3 graphics system. The Z1 boasts six primary cores and 12 threads, with four RDNA 3 compute units. The Z1 extreme gets a modest bump to 8 cores and 16 threads, but triples the RDNA 3 units to 12 to really pump out those polygons. Cache is 22MB and 24MB, respectively, and both processors support AMD&rsquo;s Radeon Super Resolution, Image Sharpening, AMD Link streaming, and Radeon Chill power saving features. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the real numbers that gamers care about are the in-game benchmarks. According to a promotional slide from AMD, the Z1 can handle 138 frames-per-second in <em>Counter-Strike: GO</em> at 1080p&mdash;about the same level as a budget or mid-range gaming desktop, depending on the settings. The Z1 Extreme can pump out 162 frames. A more demanding single-player game like<em> Red Dead Redemption 2</em> is going to hit the hardware a lot harder, but it&rsquo;s still very playable at 25 and 48 frames, respectively. <em>Forza Horizon 4</em>, a relatively well-optimized game that nonetheless benefits from higher framerates, is clocked at 83 FPS for the Z1 and an impressive 122 FPS for the Z1 Extreme.  </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Ryzen Z1 game performance benchmark chart\" class=\"wp-image-1797803\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ryzen-z1-benchmarks.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">AMD</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>What about the other side of the equation, power consumption? That&rsquo;s harder to pin down. According to <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1796614/hands-on-the-rog-ally-is-the-steam-deck-for-gamers-who-want-more-power-and-options.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">our hands-on with the Asus ROG Ally</a>, it&rsquo;s getting about the same two hours of heavy 3D gaming battery life as the Steam Deck on its much older chips&hellip;but we don&rsquo;t know the relative size of the batteries in play. The ROG Ally is also utilizing some rather fancy engineering in its dual fan cooling system. Based on these initial numbers, I&rsquo;d estimate that even if the Z1 and Z1 Extreme are a huge step up in graphical capability, they won&rsquo;t be solving the battery life weaknesses of these handheld PCs any time soon. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ROG Ally will get a full public debut on May 11th, though precise retail launch and pricing is not available at the moment. Since Zen 2-based handheld PCs came out of the woodwork after the Steam Deck&rsquo;s launch last year, you can expect a similar glut of Z1-powered gadgets from a variety of vendors in the latter half of 2023. </p>\n\nCPUs and Processors</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1797689/amd-ryzen-z1-chips-will-power-a-new-generation-of-pc-gaming-portables.html", "date_published": "2023-04-25 14:46:50+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Internxt Drive review: Fantastically affordable storage, sync, and backup", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n<div class=\"review\" id=\"review-body\"><img alt=\"Editors' Choice\" class=\"review-logo\" src=\"https://www.pcworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PC-ED-CHOICE.png\" /><span class=\"review-title\">At a glance</span><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"experts-rating\">Expert's Rating</h3><div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n<div><div class=\"review-columns\"><div class=\"review-column\"><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"pros\">Pros</h3><ul class=\"pros review-list\"><li>Online storage, sync, and backup</li><li>Fantastically affordable lifetime plans</li><li>Extremely secure and private</li><li>Free 2TB account</li></ul></div><div class=\"review-column\"><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"cons\">Cons</h3><ul class=\"cons review-list\"><li>Could use better help and task feedback</li><li>Occasional connection errors</li></ul></div></div></div><h3 class=\"review-subTitle review-subTitle--borderTop\" id=\"our-verdict\">Our Verdict</h3><p class=\"verdict\">Internxt&rsquo;s intuitively blended web access, file sync, and true backup services are impressive.

As with services such as Dropbox, Sync.com, OneDrive, iDrive, etc. there&rsquo;s sync and storage. And like the latter, true backup as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, Internxt segments its services in a very intuitive way and what <em>does</em> distinguish it from the crowd are its incredibly affordable lifetimes plans. Internxt is a relatively new venture, so you might want to hop on these deals right now before they come to their senses.  </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>Further reading:</strong> See our roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407149/online-cloud-backup-services-carbonite-idrive-backblaze-livedrive.html\">best online backup services</a> to learn about competing products.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"internxt-drive-sign-up-and-plans\">Internxt Drive sign-up and plans</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen an easier sign-up than Internxt.

The free plan can reach as high as 10GB through various actions such as inviting friends to the service. If you need more than that, there&rsquo;s a $0.89-per-month 20GB plan, a $3.49-per-month 200GB plan, and a $8.99-per-month 2TB plan. Those prices are approximate and subject to change as they reflect conversion to dollars from Euros. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those rates should drive home the idea that Internxt is competitive price-wise on a monthly basis. At first I was wishing for a 1TB plan, similar to the $70 yearly I pay for OneDrive. Then I discovered Internxt&rsquo;s lifetime plans, as shown below. Yowser!!! </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1782588\" height=\"746\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screen-Shot-2023-04-11-at-9.08.32-AM.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Internxt&rsquo;s lifetime plans are currently an incredible bargain. They&rsquo;re arguably such even at full boat.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve priced out online storage, these are eye-popping. As mentioned, the 2TB forever plan (assuming the company lasts) is only a bit more per-gigabyte than I pay for 1TB with OneDrive&hellip; for one year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As to the company lasting, while I hate to be that guy, my job description requires that I point out that Internxt is only three years old and online storage is a very competitive landscape. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, the company employs the well-known <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://us.ovhcloud.com/about/company/data-centers&amp;xcust=2-1-1679438-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">OVH storage infrastructure</a>, so worst case, your data should still be available and the lifetime pricing is more than worth a roll of the dice in my book. If you knew my tendency towards being risk-averse, you might be inclined to treat that as gospel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that all of Internxt&rsquo;s plans, regardless of cost, offer the same exact features, so no matter how much coin you&rsquo;re willing to part with, you get the full feature set. Kudos to Internxt there. Most companies use features to incentivize stepping up tiers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"internxt-drive-setup-and-usage\">Internxt Drive setup and usage</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The layout and overall structure of the website make it very easy to set up and use Internxt via a web browser. As easy, or easier than any I&rsquo;ve experienced. It&rsquo;s got a clean look as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One minor gripe is that it was difficult to find the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://help.internxt.com/en/&amp;xcust=2-1-1679438-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">help</a>. I actually gave up perusing the site (after not too long) and did a web search to find it, only to eventually discover the <em>Support</em> menu item on the local app. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Setup for the sync folder wasn&rsquo;t quite as breezy. Downloading the local app is easy enough, but the splash screens could provide a bit more info on where the sync folder is created, and what it&rsquo;s named (Internxt).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Open the app after it&rsquo;s installed, and there&rsquo;s an icon to take you to the sync folder. That said, I found the location needlessly arcane. Fortunately, you can change it to a more prominent area such as the desktop, where you can access it without the app.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>All of Internxt&rsquo;s plans, regardless of cost, offer the same exact features. Kudos to Internxt there, since most companies use features to incentivize stepping up tiers.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1782507\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screen-Shot-2023-04-10-at-3.31.17-PM.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>The Internxt website is easy to decipher and browse. A clean, intuitive layout to be sure.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>One macOS bug: When adding the folder &ldquo;1. Midi files&rdquo; the folder showed up in the list as &ldquo;1&rdquo; and wouldn&rsquo;t back up for obvious reasons. You can be careful with your naming, but Internxt should and probably will fix this. Another mild gripe&mdash;the entire path to the sync folder is not shown in the app, only its parent folder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Glitches aside, none of Internxt is rocket science, a couple or 20 minutes with it should be all you need. Hint: A lot of stuff is hidden in the local app&rsquo;s preferences dialog. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"internxt-drive-features\">Internxt Drive features </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Internxt&rsquo;s features are basically four-fold: sync, backup, photo backup, and sharing. These are all located in different areas of the onscreen interface that you access via a menu tree to the left.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Syncing (to the Drive folder online) works like most services, you drag or add files to the Internxt folder and they&rsquo;re synced between the devices you have Internxt installed on. There are apps for iOS and Android.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1781289\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screen-Shot-2023-04-10-at-3.31.53-PM.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>You can change the location of the Sync folder using the preferences  dialog. A good thing as you&rsquo;re not really told where the default location is.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Backup should never be confused with sync, which is normally a two-way operation where any changes made on any device are duplicated on the other devices. Backups are copied from one device to the cloud and are only altered remotely when files change on the originating device. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may schedule backups for every six hours, 12 hours, or once a day. Newer files overwrite older ones, which Internxt confirmed&mdash;i.e, there&rsquo;s no versioning. If you&rsquo;re looking for that, and it can be handy in certain situations&mdash;look elsewhere. I&rsquo;ve never needed it, and for most users, current-state backup will be fine. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1781288\" height=\"1055\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screen-Shot-2023-04-10-at-3.32.39-PM.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>You can add multiple folders to the backup list and they will then be copied to the online storage Backups section. These are a true backup and separate from files synced across devices.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Photo backup simply backs up the photos on your phone as do Google Drive and iCloud (when enabled). These are not synced, but as with backups, simply copied to the photos folder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s also a separate section where shared files are kept&mdash;i.e., files shared with others, not among the Internxt sections. The separation reduces user confusion, even if it might waste a bit of space due to duplication.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-does-internxt-drive-perform\">How does Internxt Drive perform?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sync was generally fine performance-wise, though I didn&rsquo;t go much beyond 1GB of files. One issue I did notice was when I deleted the files online, they repopulated online from the local folders rather than being deleted from local folders. I had expected the changes to be logged and reflected on other devices. I can understand this, but it&rsquo;s not complete two-way sync.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While both my 50GB and 400GB backups eventually completed, it wasn&rsquo;t without travail. Both quit intermittently due to connection errors. A couple were caused by my failure to turn off Windows sleep, but others were listed as &ldquo;can&rsquo;t contact server&rdquo; errors with a live connection. The backups resumed automatically, but it was a bit puzzling. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another mild issue is the &ldquo;An unknown error has occurred&rdquo; message seen in the screen capture below. This could give one the impression that the backup isn&rsquo;t transpiring, when it actually is. Far less disturbing would be something like &ldquo;Click here to see the error log&rdquo;. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1790117\" height=\"1008\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screen-Shot-2023-04-18-at-10.14.06-AM.png\" width=\"884\" /><figcaption>8% of how much is the question. The entire backup, or what&rsquo;s left? Also, the error message wasn&rsquo;t current, but a previous event. </figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of logs, Internxt keeps them and provides a link, but they contain every operation. There should be a separate log for errors so you don&rsquo;t have to search through 10MB of text to find them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing Internxt should also implement is bandwidth throttling. Backups came too close to maxing out the upstream traffic for my taste, slowing or creating issues for other tasks on occasion. The backup function could also use better feedback. Knowing I&rsquo;m 8 percent through a backup of unstated size (see above) is relatively useless. To be fair, Internxt is not alone in this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing I did like was being warned about zero-byte files. It turns out my DAW (Ableton Live) creates lots of these. Or, they were damaged in copying&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know which. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Success is always the bottom line, so good on ya&rsquo;, Internxt. But please make the process a bit less paranoia-inducing for those who&rsquo;ve seen too many backups fail.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"is-internxt-drive-worth-it\">Is Internxt Drive worth it?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I find Internxt exceptionally easy to understand and use simply because it segregates tasks the way our minds do. The fact that the lifetime plans are currently a flat-out steal for the user doesn&rsquo;t hurt my opinion either.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hand-holding could be better, as well as the feedback during jobs, but geez Louise, Internxt can save you a ton of money.</p>\n\nPersonal Software, Storage</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1679438/internxt-drive-online-backup-review-fantastically-affordable-online-storage-sync-and-true-backup.html", "date_published": "2023-04-25 14:30:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Hands-on: The ROG Ally is a Steam Deck competitor with more power and options", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>You can run Windows on the Steam Deck. <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/693762/steam-decks-first-major-update-adds-lockscreen-and-windows-11-support.html\">And you really, really shouldn&rsquo;t</a>. Valve&rsquo;s portable machine has singularly carved out a new hardware niche for PC gamers, but it did so with a system built around the Linux-based SteamOS from the ground up. Such competitors that have arrived in the last year come from smaller companies without the resources to either sell games or make software, and have thus had to settle for more expensive machines with roughly the same specs, running Windows. And frankly, they don&rsquo;t measure up. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Want to know more about the Steam Deck? Here&rsquo;s everything you ever wanted to know about the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/617378/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-the-steam-deck.html\">portable gaming machine</a>.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The Asus ROG Ally might just be the first competitor that can. It&rsquo;s a familiar form factor, with more power thanks to a brand new AMD Z1 chip based on Zen 4. And it was made from day one with Windows gaming in mind, to the same degree that the Steam Deck was built around its operating system. And thanks to compatibility with the same proprietary external graphics cards as the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/629083/asus-flow-z13-review-an-even-more-modular-gaming-tablet.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ROG Flow laptops and tablets</a>, it might&mdash;<em>might</em>&mdash;be able to fully replace a gaming laptop or desktop. Hell, it might just be able to replace a full desktop PC, period. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Will that extra capability be worth the inevitably higher price of the ROG Ally versus the Steam Deck, especially since the ROG XG Mobile eGPU is another thousand bucks (at least) on top of that? Who knows. But it&rsquo;s certainly shaping up to be an interesting alternative for those who demand more power and options. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>The  ROG Ally might just be the first Steam Deck competitor that can measure up.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-does-the-rog-ally-feel-to-play\">How does the ROG Ally feel to play?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Picking up the Ally reminded me of a larger, more angular Nintendo Switch. That&rsquo;s probably not surprising&mdash;that&rsquo;s what the thing <em>looks </em>like, after all. But what shocked me is that it&rsquo;s also about as light. Seeing this incredibly compact hunk of plastic and electronics, ostensibly with full PC power, you&rsquo;d assume it would feel heavy in your hands like an oversized smartphone. Not so! While it&rsquo;s large and only &ldquo;pocketable&rdquo; if you&rsquo;re still rocking vintage JNCOs, it should be light enough to toss it in almost any bag and forget it&rsquo;s there. I didn&rsquo;t have a kitchen scale handy, but specs say that it&rsquo;s a little over half a kilogram (1.34 pounds). That&rsquo;s a bit heavier than an iPad, but feels lighter thanks to those comfy grips. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"ROG Ally right side thumbstick\" class=\"wp-image-1796657\" height=\"676\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DSC00832.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>And the Ally is comfy, for lack of a more precise word. Though the slanted lines and angled plastic make it look &ldquo;sharper&rdquo; than the curvy Steam Deck, this is deceptive. The gadget is rounded in all the right places, and your hands don&rsquo;t touch any of the angular bits while in play. I can see this thing going for hours of gaming sessions&hellip; or at least one to two hours, when your battery will need a recharge. During our brief demonstration time, the Ally managed to stay cool even while playing <em>Ghostrunner </em>and <em>Forza</em>, a testament to its dual interior fans, which were hard to hear spin up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other big difference versus the Steam Deck is the screen. The Deck&rsquo;s 7-inch, 800p screen maxes out at 400 nits, which is fine for what it is&mdash;again, about the same as the original Nintendo Switch. But the Ally beats it in almost every way. It&rsquo;s the same size, but with full 1080p resolution, 500 nits of brightness, and a doubled 120Hz refresh rate, making it match a mid-range gaming monitor. At 7ms of response time, it&rsquo;s not incredibly quick, but standard FreeSync compatibility, which most gaming laptops have (and the Steam Deck&rsquo;s internal screen does not) should help fix that. Asus was also quick to point out that it has a smartphone-style Gorilla Glass Victus cover with a Corning DXC coating for better visibility in sunlight. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Asus ROG Ally left side\" class=\"wp-image-1796658\" height=\"676\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DSC00762.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The big omission? Touch pads. An iconic part of Valve&rsquo;s hardware design since the original Steam controller, Asus opted to go for larger, Dolby Atmos-compatible front-facing speakers instead. That might limit your options with less controller-friendly Windows games on the go. The Ally also has RGB lighting, if you really must show off this eye-catching design even more, with rings around both thumbsticks and a small bar on the back. I&rsquo;ll note that some gamers, particularly fighter fans, might take issue with the Genesis-style circular D-pad. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-are-the-specs-of-the-rog-ally\">What are the specs of the ROG Ally?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What about the insides of this thing? Asus has teamed up with AMD to make the Ally the debut device for the Ryzen Z1 series of processors, designed specifically for mobile PC gaming form factors like this one. With 4-nanometer Zen 4 architecture and an RDNA 3 graphics core, it&rsquo;s using at least some of the same silicon as the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1063208/amd-mobile-ryzen-naming-scheme.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">absolute cutting edge of Ryzen laptops</a>. Combined with the dual fan system and liquid cooling &ldquo;anti-gravity heat pipes,&rdquo; it should be a shockingly powerful little system. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"ROG Ally gaming handheld specs\" class=\"wp-image-1796651\" height=\"933\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ROG-Ally_One-pager_0421.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Asus</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>How powerful? Honestly, we don&rsquo;t know. More technical information and benchmarks weren&rsquo;t made available, and Asus didn&rsquo;t say precisely what GPU powers this new model of APU is rocking. It&rsquo;s certainly more powerful than the Steam Deck and most of its competitors that have arrived in the last year, all based on Zen 2. But playing some of the latest PC games on this thing, in full Windows 11, didn&rsquo;t seem to give it any trouble at all. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other notable aspects of its Windows-powered hardware include a maximum of 16GB DDR5 RAM (lower capacities may or may not be sold, we don&rsquo;t know yet), a maximum of 512GB of M.2 2230 PCIe gen 4 storage (ditto), a MicroSD card slot with UHS-II speed for expansion, Wi-Fi 6E, and a smartphone-style fingerprint sensor in the power button, the better to log into Windows sans keyboard. All the expansion ports are on the top edge, including USB-C, dedicated headphone jack, and that proprietary port for the mobile dock. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"even-more-power-if-you-pay-for-it\">Even more power, if you pay for it </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about that mobile dock for a moment. The ROG Ally is perfectly happy to plug into a monitor or TV with a standard USB-C hub, a la the Steam Deck or Switch, and play games off its own internal power. But one of its key differentiators is the ability to plug into an ROG XG external GPU. Asus has been making these laptop-GPUs-in-a-box for its Flow series for going on three years, allowing them to be ultraportable machines that can plug into hefty, power-hungry graphics when they need to. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>When it&rsquo;s plugged into one of the XG docks, it&rsquo;s hard to tell that you&rsquo;re not using a desktop gaming PC.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Asus ROG Ally with XG dock playing PC games\" class=\"wp-image-1796659\" height=\"806\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DSC00746.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ally pulls the same trick. And when it&rsquo;s plugged into one of the XG docks, it&rsquo;s hard to tell that you&rsquo;re not using a full desktop gaming PC. Asus had a demonstration running at the event, playing <em>Ghostrunner </em>at 4K resolution on a 27-inch monitor and it was buttery smooth for that blink-and-you&rsquo;re-dead combat game. That was with the RTX 4090 version of the dock, mind you, and the little plastic hunk was basically a space heater as it drove video on the monitor and the Ally at the same time. The mobile docks also include wired Ethernet plus plenty of spare USB ports for your gaming gear and an extra USB-C Gen2 Type C. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"ROG Ally and XG graphics dock\" class=\"wp-image-1796660\" height=\"741\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DSC00904.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>This is, frankly, super freakin&rsquo; cool. Yes, the Ally <em>could </em>replace a full desktop, assuming you&rsquo;re willing to put that extra money in. And it&rsquo;s quite a bit of money: Asus is selling last year&rsquo;s model <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://rog.asus.com/us/external-graphic-docks/rog-xg-mobile-2022-model/&amp;xcust=2-1-1796614-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">with a Radeon RX 6850 XT card for $1,000</a> while the 2023 RTX 4090 version at the demo event <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://rog.asus.com/us/external-graphic-docks/rog-xg-mobile-2023-model/&amp;xcust=2-1-1796614-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">goes for two grand</a>. $2,000, plus whatever you spend on the Ally itself, can buy a whole lot of gaming desktop or a pretty great gaming laptop. And, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/423614/how-to-transform-your-laptop-into-a-gaming-powerhouse-with-an-external-graphics-card.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">unlike other eGPU docks</a>, these are mobile graphics cards that can&rsquo;t be upgraded independent of the PCIe-based chassis. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of capability and a lot of money. Frankly, I&rsquo;d be tempted to spend $1500 on a mid-range gaming PC and buy an Ally at the same time, assuming I had the disposable income for both. But this sort of whiz-bang tech always comes at a premium, at least at launch. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"windows-gaming-outdoors\">Windows gaming, outdoors </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The technical capabilities of the Ally + XG dock are undeniable and even without it, it makes for a pretty solid desktop machine when you plug in a monitor, keyboard, mouse, and speakers. (Yeah, that&rsquo;s a lot of hardware to add on, now that I list it out). And you can get all that capability with Windows 11 installed out of the box. I&rsquo;m less convinced of the Ally&rsquo;s ability to easily navigate Windows on the go, with its lack of touchpads and reliance on a touchscreen keyboard. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course Windows, and the nigh-unlimited games it offers across all PC-based game stores, is another one of the big draws for the Ally. &ldquo;Every Game, Every Platform, All At Once&rdquo; is the trendy Oscar-style tagline Asus goes with, since the gadget <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/394895/what-is-valve-proton-steam-deck-games-software-explained.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">won&rsquo;t rely on Linux releases or an emulation layer</a>. That also means that some of the games that still stubbornly refuse to run on the Steam Deck&mdash;like <em>Fortnite</em>, for example&mdash;can be confidently played without a &ldquo;Certified&rdquo; label.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"ROG Ally top ports\" class=\"wp-image-1796661\" height=\"676\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DSC00777.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>And speaking of non-Steam games, the included Armoury Crate SE app is the latest in a long line to claim to unify all your disparate gaming libraries. In my brief time with it, I found it finicky and disjointed. In addition to yet another interface for launching games, it&rsquo;s also where you adjust settings like the Ally&rsquo;s trigger sensitivity, lighting effects, et cetera. Frankly, I&rsquo;d rather connect a full mouse and keyboard and just <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1501480/master-your-steam-deck-with-these-22-tips-and-tricks.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">add external games to Steam&rsquo;s Big Picture Mode</a>, which should work just as well on the Ally&rsquo;s Windows hardware as it does elsewhere. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that you&rsquo;re unlikely to go for any super-long gaming sessions on the road. An Asus representative told me that in testing they managed to get an average of about 90 minutes of game time, maybe two hours if they turned down the visual settings. The Ally can go further, if you opt for streaming games via Game Pass or GeForce Now, but that also requires a rock-solid connection. Whatever you&rsquo;re playing, you&rsquo;ll want to pack a charger in the bag, especially if you&rsquo;re on a long-haul flight or cross-country bus or car ride. That&rsquo;s about the same as the Steam Deck and its contemporaries. But battery life remains an Achilles heel of this form factor and doesn&rsquo;t seem likely to get better any time soon. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-much-is-the-rog-ally-going-to-cost\">How much is the ROG Ally going to cost? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s the 64,000-dollar question&mdash;or probably more like the 1,000-dollar question. The Steam Deck starts at just $400, maxing out at $650 for the highest-end model with more storage and a slightly better screen. Popular wisdom says Valve is using old-fashioned <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_leader&amp;xcust=2-1-1796614-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">game console loss leader tactics</a>, losing money on every Steam Deck sale and hoping to make it back on software sales. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With newer AMD Z1 hardware and an improvement in just about every measurable technical capacity and without literally millions of gamers giving a cut on every game sale, there&rsquo;s absolutely no chance the ROG Ally will be anywhere close to the Steam Deck&rsquo;s entry-level price. The Windows license alone would make that basically impossible. The question then becomes, how much <em>more </em>will the Ally cost and will it be worth it in terms of the added capability and value? </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"ROG Ally exploded view\" class=\"wp-image-1796662\" height=\"1069\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DSC00712.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s an answer we&rsquo;re still waiting for. Asus wasn&rsquo;t prepared to nail down a price for the Ally at the preview event. Unconfirmed leaks have pegged a base model at $650 and an upgraded version at $900. Frankly, that&rsquo;s very optimistic. None of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/707281/cheaper-steam-deck-competitors-are-on-the-way.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">early Windows-based Steam Deck alternatives</a> have managed to come in under $1,000 and even with Asus&rsquo; access to incredible economies of scale, I&rsquo;d be shocked to see it priced at anything less than a grand for a base model. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that&rsquo;s speculation. For a final word on price and by extension on the ROG Ally&rsquo;s value proposition, we&rsquo;ll have to wait until later this year. </p>\n\nGaming Laptops</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1796614/hands-on-the-rog-ally-is-the-steam-deck-for-gamers-who-want-more-power-and-options.html", "date_published": "2023-04-25 14:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "How to make Windows 11 look like Windows 10", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft knows how you want Windows to look. That, at least, seems to be the company&rsquo;s message with <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/539183/windows-11-review-an-unnecessary-replacement-for-windows-10.html\">Windows 11</a>. It makes big changes to the user interface and continues the trend of making user customization more difficult. That&rsquo;s part of the reason why some of PCWorld&rsquo;s staff <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1788084/every-time-i-use-windows-11-i-wish-i-were-using-windows-10.html\">wish they were using Windows 10 whenever they use Windows 11</a>, despite some truly compelling upgrades in the new operating system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s not currently possible to fully revert Windows 11 to the look for Windows 10 and, given Microsoft&rsquo;s current attitude towards UI customization, it may never be. Still, there are several key tweaks that can make you more comfortable.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"start-menu-location\">Start menu location</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Windows 11&rsquo;s most obvious design change is the relocation of the Windows Start menu from its traditional home nestled on the taskbar&rsquo;s left side to the center of the taskbar. Fortunately, this change is easy to revert.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Windows 11 left taskbar\" class=\"wp-image-541457\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matt Smith/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Open the <strong>Windows Start </strong>menu and then the <strong>Settings </strong>app. In Settings, navigate to <strong>Personalization</strong>, then <strong>Taskbar</strong>, and open <strong>Taskbar behaviors</strong>. You&rsquo;ll see a field labeled <strong>Taskbar alignment </strong>with a drop-down menu. Change the drop-dox menu from Center to Left.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The change takes place immediately.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"remove-new-icons\">Remove new icons</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While we&rsquo;re here, let&rsquo;s disable the new icons added by Windows 11. These are also in the <strong>Taskbar </strong>section of <strong>Personalization </strong>settings. You will see a list labeled &ldquo;Taskbar items&rdquo; that includes four options: <strong>Search</strong>, <strong>Task view</strong>, <strong>Widgets</strong>, and <strong>Chat</strong>. Use the toggles next to each to turn all four icons off.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Windows 11 taskbar personalization\" class=\"wp-image-541459\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matt Smith/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>An important note about Search: there&rsquo;s currently no way to restore the full Search field from the Windows 10 taskbar. Turning off the new Search icon means you can&rsquo;t access Search by clicking a field or icon on the taskbar. It will still be available through the <strong>Windows + S keyboard shortcut</strong>, however.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"start-menu-design\">Start menu design</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft is kind enough to let you easily change the Start menu&rsquo;s location and remove some icons, but the Start menu <em>itself</em> is a different story. You&rsquo;ll need to use a third-party program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The free option is <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://open-shell.github.io/Open-Shell-Menu/&amp;xcust=2-1-541452-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Open-Shell</a>, an open-source program (formerly known as Classic Shell) that can replace the start menu. Download the program and install it. However, make sure to disable Classic Explorer and Classic IE during installation. If you don&rsquo;t, Open-Shell will also modify Windows Explorer in a way that doesn&rsquo;t vibe with the look of Windows 10.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Windows 11 left Start menu\" class=\"wp-image-541458\" height=\"801\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matt Smith/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Once installed, open the program called <strong>Open-Shell Menu Settings</strong>. Select the Windows 7 style menu and then open the Skin tab. I used the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://github.com/bonzibudd/Fluent-Metro&amp;xcust=2-1-541452-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fluent-Metro skin</a> for this guide. In truth, it functions more like a Windows 7 Start Menu with Windows 10 coat of paint, but it was the best skin I could find.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Open-Shell works ok, it&rsquo;s not perfect. It can&rsquo;t properly replace the Start Menu and doesn&rsquo;t restore Windows 10 features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.stardock.com/products/start11/&amp;xcust=2-1-541452-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stardock&rsquo;s Start11</a> is an easier option. It doesn&rsquo;t have the Start menu icon problem of Open-Shell and requires no installation of additional files to deliver an attractive menu in the Metro design style. Start11 costs $5, however, so you&rsquo;ll have to decide if its ease-of-use is worth the price. <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/549492/hands-on-stardocks-start11-largely-solves-the-sins-of-windows-11.html\">We&rsquo;ve tested Start11</a> (as well as alternative <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/552936/startallback-fixes-what-i-hate-about-the-windows-11-ui.html\">StartAllBack</a>, another $5 program) and highly recommend both if you&rsquo;re interested in making Windows 11 look more like Windows 10. Those programs can also help you skirt around some of <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/549576/the-windows-11-taskbar-is-an-annoying-step-backward.html\">Windows 11&rsquo;s taskbar woes</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"change-icons\">Change icons</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The taskbar icons in Windows 11 are quite similar to Windows 10, so you might not feel the need to change them. Other icons throughout the operating system are significantly different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, download a Windows 10 icon pack. A variety of these can be found online: I used a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://winaero.com/download-download-icons-from-windows-10-10125/&amp;xcust=2-1-541452-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Windows 10 Build 10125 icon pack</a>. Place your icons in a folder you can conveniently remember.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s start with desktop icons. Open the <strong>Settings </strong>app, select <strong>Personalization</strong>, open <strong>Themes</strong>, and then <strong>Desktop Icons</strong>. A menu will appear with the five usual desktop icons present. Click an icon you want to change and then tap <strong>Change icon</strong>. Navigate to where you placed the icon pack, select the icon you want to use, and then tap Open. I&rsquo;ve replaced the Recycle Bin icons in the screenshot below.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Windows 11 change icons\" class=\"wp-image-541454\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matt Smith/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also change the icons of individual folders and shortcuts. Right-click on an item and open <strong>Properties</strong>, then head to the <strong>Customize</strong> tab. At the bottom you&rsquo;ll see the <strong>Change Icon</strong> button. Click it and select an icon you&rsquo;d like to use as described in the previous paragraph.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, Windows 11 doesn&rsquo;t let you change some icons, most notably the new icons for drives and user folders in Windows Explorer. You can use <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.redmondpie.com/how-to-change-your-drive-icon-in-vista/&amp;xcust=2-1-541452-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Drive Icon Changer</a> to change drive icons, however.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"disable-rounded-corners\">Disable rounded corners</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Round corners are key to the new look of Windows 11. Not everyone loves them, however, and there&rsquo;s more bad news. It&rsquo;s not currently possible to change them through Windows 11 itself or a third-party solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You do have one option. Windows 11 will revert to square corners if you turn off hardware graphics acceleration (this will also turn off other visual features like transparency).</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Windows 11 disable graphics hardware\" class=\"wp-image-541455\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matt Smith/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, there is one <em>other</em> option: you can disable your graphics hardware. Open <strong>Device Manager</strong>, expand <strong>Display Adapters</strong>, and right-click the display adapter listed. Select <strong>Disable Device</strong>. Your screen will flicker a moment but, when Windows returns, the rounded corners will be gone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&rsquo;t recommend this, however. Disabling your graphics hardware will cause the Windows UI to feel slow and stilted, and you won&rsquo;t be able to use 3D apps or games until you turn the hardware back on.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"change-the-wallpaper\">Change the wallpaper</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Last, but least, you can restore the original Windows 10 wallpaper. This is not included with Windows 11, but is available from a variety of sources online,<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://imgur.com/smV2eqv&amp;xcust=2-1-541452-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\"> such as this 4K sample on Imgur</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right-click the image after you download it and then select <strong>Set as desktop background</strong>. The change will take effect immediately.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"where-to-go-from-here\">Where to go from here</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Windows 11 as Windows 10\" class=\"wp-image-541456\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/6.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matt Smith/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Windows 10 purists will be disappointed to hear this leaves several features of Windows 11, like the new context menu and File Explorer, in the operating system. A variety of registry hacks circulating online claim to partially or fully disable these features, but in my testing they either caused side effects or, in many cases, didn&rsquo;t work at all&mdash;likely because Windows 11 has received many updates over the past few months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep an eye on projects that aim to help users change the look and feel of Windows 11, such the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1786965/bring-back-windows-11s-missing-features-for-free-with-explorer-patcher.html\">utterly fantastic (and free) Explorer Patcher</a>, which restores taskbar labels, brings back Windows 10&rsquo;s context menu, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to let Microsoft know that you&rsquo;d like more customization options. Much of this ultimately falls on Microsoft, which has gradually eliminated options for customizing the Windows interface over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, enjoy the changes you&rsquo;ve made. It might not fully restore Windows 10, but hey&mdash;at least the Start menu is fixed. While you&rsquo;re busy tweaking things, here are <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1782303/5-windows-11-settings-worth-changing-immediately.html\">five Windows 11 settings worth changing immediately</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Editor&rsquo;s note: This article originally published on October 7, 2021, but was updated several times to reflect new Windows 11 developments and workaround programs.</em></p>\n\nWindows</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/541452/make-windows-11-look-like-windows-10.html", "date_published": "2023-04-25 13:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Chargers and power bank jargon, demystified", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>In theory, charging your phone, tablet, or laptop should be pretty simple: Plug a cable into the device, plug the cable into a charger, wait for the device to charge, and be on your way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But never underestimate the tech industry&rsquo;s ability to complicate.

It pairs simple, matte-black front bezel plastics with a similarly basic rear panel adorned with just a subtle BenQ logo.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"BenQ GW2785TC\" class=\"wp-image-1780821\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/benq-gw2785tc-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matt Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>What it lacks in flair, it makes up in function. Build quality is great for a budget monitor, with solid plastic panels, no obvious flex, and a good sense of heft. I particularly appreciate the textured matte plastic on the rear panel. It obscures wear and provides some friction, which makes the monitor a tad easier to move and adjust.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"BenQ GW2785TC\" class=\"wp-image-1780802\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/benq-gw2785tc-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>The BenQ GW2785TC is functional but lacks flair.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matt Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>BenQ includes an ergonomic stand that provides height, tilt, and swivel. It can also rotate 90 degrees into portrait orientation, which is helpful if you plan to use the monitor as a second display. The stand has a small, flat base, which minimizes the monitor&rsquo;s footprint on your desk. There&rsquo;s also a built-in handle, which is useful if you need to move the monitor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the bundled stand is excellent, a 100x100mm VESA mount is available for adding a third-party monitor stand or arm.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>The BenQ GW2785TC is a versatile, easy-to-use monitor&mdash;traits that count for a lot when your budget is around $250.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"benq-gw2785tc-features-and-menus\">BenQ GW2785TC features and menus&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The GW2785TC is built for basic home productivity but offers several features you won&rsquo;t find in less expensive office monitors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/612470/you-should-buy-a-usb-c-hub-monitor-heres-what-you-need-to-know.html\">USB-C is the headliner</a>. The monitor has USB-C power with 60 watts of Power Delivery and DIsplayPort Alternate Mode. This allows a single-cable connection with a USB-C compatible laptop or tablet. The USB-C cable will handle video and also charge the device. It&rsquo;s a great feature to have in a budget display. This isn&rsquo;t a USB-C hub monitor, however, as it lacks USB-A ports for connecting a USB-A keyboard, mouse, or hard drive.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will find a DisplayPort-out port, however, which is <em>extremely</em> unusual for a monitor in this price bracket. DisplayPort-out enables &ldquo;daisy-chain&rdquo; video connections. You can connect a video input to the BenQ GW2785TC and then connect a second monitor to the GW2785TC&rsquo;s DIsplayPort-out. It&rsquo;s a handy feature if your laptop or desktop lacks multiple video outputs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"BenQ GW2785TC\" class=\"wp-image-1780803\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/benq-gw2785tc-6.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>The BenQ GW2785TC&rsquo;s menu has great image-quality features.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matt Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The monitor&rsquo;s on-screen menu is fast, responsive, and easy to use. BenQ offers a few image-quality features, including multiple color temperature and gamma options, but customization is otherwise limited. However, the monitor does offer a wide range of use modes that might be useful for people who find it difficult to use a monitor for long periods of time. This includes a Color Weakness mode meant to improve image quality for those with color blindness.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Strangely, the monitor also includes a microphone. I&rsquo;m a bit puzzled as to why this is included: BenQ advertises it as a productivity feature for video conferences, but nearly all webcams have a built-in microphone of equal quality, so it feels a bit pointless. Speakers are bundled as well, and as true of most budget monitors, audio quality is unimpressive. They&rsquo;re fine if you want to listen to a podcast but sound scuffed when listening to music.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"benq-gw2785tc-sdr-image-quality\">BenQ GW2785TC SDR image quality</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The GW2785TC is a basic monitor, and BenQ sets basic expectations about image quality. Its marketing makes next to no claims about the display&rsquo;s image quality, instead focusing more on its added features, ergonomics, and design. It&rsquo;s not a shock, then, to see the GW2785TC deliver modest scores in image quality tests.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"BenQ GW2785TC\" class=\"wp-image-1780804\" height=\"850\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/benq-gw2785tc-brightness.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matt Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>We start with brightness which, I think, is the monitor&rsquo;s worst result. BenQ claims a maximum of 250 nits, but I saw only 234 nits sustained. That&rsquo;s not much even for an inexpensive monitor, and the monitor will not appear bright or vivid if used in a bright room. In short, it&rsquo;s best to use the monitor in a room where you can close the shades and turn down the lights.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"BenQ GW2785TC\" class=\"wp-image-1780805\" height=\"846\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/benq-gw2785tc-contrast.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matt Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget is-half-width is-float-right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"mentioned-in-this-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\tMentioned in this article\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"acer-k242hyl\">Acer K242HYL</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Acer K242HYL\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/acer-k242hyl-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1500\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review product-widget__review-details\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__rating-and-review-link\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__review-details--rating\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/631916/acer-k242hyl-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__pricing-details  \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/321564/1175784/1036?prodsku=ACK242HYLBIX&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fack242hylbix.html&amp;intsrc=CATF_9102&amp;subid1=2-3-1777291-5-632573-9925\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$132.99 at  Adorama</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"amp-bar\"> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8200811-15180503?sid=2-3-1777291-5-632573-9925&amp;url=https://www.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/model/UM.QX2AA.B03\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$149.99 at  Acer</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>The monitor&rsquo;s contrast ratio is also limited, though it scores similarly to other entry-level IPS displays such as the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/631916/acer-k242hyl-review.html\">Acer K242HYL</a>. A contrast ratio of 620:1 is extremely limited and indicates the monitor will appear a bit flat and shallow in complex content, like streaming TV, games, or high-quality photographs. It&rsquo;s most noticeable in a very dark room, as this reveals the common &ldquo;IPS glow,&rdquo; a hazy look casts a fog across dark scenes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"BenQ GW2785TC\" class=\"wp-image-1780806\" height=\"848\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/benq-gw2785tc-color-gamut.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matt Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Color gamut is typical for a budget monitor, spanning 99 percent of the sRGB gamut but only 76 percent of DCI-P3. This is not a &ldquo;wide gamut&rdquo; monitor, which means it can&rsquo;t display as many colors as more expensive alternatives. However, given its price, the GW2785TC&rsquo;s performance is reasonable, and it can deliver attractive color in most content.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"BenQ GW2785TC\" class=\"wp-image-1780807\" height=\"902\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/benq-gw2785tc-color-accuracy.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matt Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The monitor&rsquo;s color accuracy isn&rsquo;t top-notch. This is a trait I&rsquo;ve observed with many BenQ monitors as of late, and something I think the company should look into. On the other hand, this level of color accuracy is more than enough for the kind of day-to-day office productivity this monitor targets. Images appear correct and lifelike.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I recorded a gamma curve of 2.1 and a color temperature of 6600K, which is compared to a target gamma of 2.2 and color temperature of 6500K. The GW2785TC is very close to the ideal in most situations, which means the image doesn&rsquo;t appear too cool or too warm. That&rsquo;s actually rather important for an office monitor&mdash;an incorrect color temperature can be obvious if you&rsquo;re staring at Word or Excel all day.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What about sharpness? This is a 27-inch 1080p monitor, which translates to a pixel density of roughly 82 pixels per inch. That&rsquo;s pretty low by modern standards: a 24-inch 1080p monitor will have about 90 pixels per inch, and a 27-inch 1440p packs about 109 pixels per inch. The GW2785TC&rsquo;s can look a bit soft when viewing streaming content, and pixelation can be obvious around fine fonts. These issues aren&rsquo;t overly distracting, however, and only leap out when compared directly to a 1440p display.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On balance, the BenQ GW2785TC delivers what I&rsquo;d expect from an inexpensive productivity monitor: a usable but unimpressive image. It&rsquo;s far from top-notch in most respects but also avoids serious flaws that might hold it back in real-world use. It&rsquo;s fine. And, at this price, that&rsquo;s about what I expect.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"does-the-benq-gw2785tc-support-hdr\">Does the BenQ GW2785TC support HDR?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The GW2785TC doesn&rsquo;t support HDR, which may seem disappointing on paper, as some competitors do claim HDR support. However, budget monitors like the GW2785TC lack the brightness and color gamut required to make HDR appear superior to SDR. BenQ&rsquo;s decision to keep HDR off the box is an honest representation of what the monitor can handle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-is-the-benq-gw2785tc-motion-performance\">How is the BenQ GW2785TC motion performance?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Motion clarity is not a focus of the BenW GW2785TC. It lacks adaptive-sync compatibility, including<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/423202/g-sync-vs-freesync-amd-nvidia-monitor.html\"> AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync</a>. It does offer a 75Hz refresh rate, which is a bit higher than the standard 60Hz, but the difference can be difficult to notice. Motion doesn&rsquo;t always appear smooth and significant blur occurs whenever an object moves quickly across the screen, but no different from other 60- to 75Hz monitors in this price range.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"is-the-benq-gw2785tc-worth-it\">Is the BenQ GW2785TC worth it?</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"BenQ GW2785TC\" class=\"wp-image-1780810\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/benq-gw2785tc-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Matt Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s easy to feel disappointed while browsing the BenQ GW2785TC&rsquo;s image-quality results. The monitor delivers merely passable scores across most areas. It avoids major pitfalls but also fails to achieve any victories.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you just want a great productivity monitor, however, its mediocre image quality is less relevant than its excellent feature set. BenQ provides a solid ergonomic stand, USB-C, DisplayPort-out, and solid build quality at a reasonable price.
