In an <a href="https://abc.xyz/investor/static/pdf/2023Q1_alphabet_earnings_release.pdf?cache=0924ccf">earnings release</a> today, Google reported its “search &amp; other” revenues were up 1.87 percent year over year (jumping from about $39.6B to $40.4B), which is much smaller growth than the 24.28 percent jump the company saw in Q1 2022 and the 30.11 percent bump in Q1 2021.</p>
<p id="7N8ILN">Right now, search is seeing significant competition from all sides.

<p id="h8ew5m">The amount is double what Netflix has invested in K-dramas since 2016 — and it’s no surprise given the monumental success of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723452/netflix-squid-game-biggest-ever-show-at-launch"><em>Squid Game</em></a> as well as <em>The Glory</em> and <em>Physical: 100</em>.

Spotify posted its first quarter earnings this morning, reporting that the service in April finally reached over half a billion (or 515 million) monthly users. But first quarter revenue fell short of expectations — even though the platform’s podcast ad revenue saw a significant (20 percent) boost from this time last year. Still, the era of big spending by Spotify on podcasts is likely done, CEO Daniel Ek explained during the call. I’ll dive into more detail below. </p>

  <p id="JWy23i">AI Drake has struck again, and the latest track shows just how easy it is for someone to use a familiar celebrity voice to make a song go viral. The track, called “Not a Game,” first emerged on <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com%2Fvibevillagee%2Fdrake-not-a-game-ai&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2023%2F4%2F25%2F23696155%2Fviral-drake-ai-repurposed-soundcloud-rap" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WKH1b2U_YA">YouTube</a> late last week and arrived only days after a song from someone named Ghostwriter went viral for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/18/23688141/ai-drake-song-ghostwriter-copyright-umg-the-weeknd">featuring Drake’s AI-generated voice</a>. “Not a Game” <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2023/04/19/two-new-ai-drake-songs-surface-umg-takedown-fake-weeknd-collab/">got mentions in both <em>TMZ</em></a> <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-11991705/Drake-victim-fake-songs-generated-AI-despite-record-label-trying-stop-them.html">and the <em>Daily Mail</em></a>, shining even more of a spotlight on the track.</p>
<p id="HGBtaG">But it turns out, “Not a Game” isn’t exactly a brand-new song. <em>The Verge</em> found that the track is composed of multiple preexisting elements, with the primary new addition being the Drake voice.</p>

  <p id="HFaotX">Young Horses, known for lighthearted games like <em>Octodad: Dadliest Catch</em> and <em>Bugsnax</em>, just released four free games that you can play on Steam right now. Even though the studio is describing them as “smaller side projects,” the games, which Young Horses is releasing under what it calls the “Free Range initiative,” all seem like fun diversions to check out if you’re looking for something silly to play.</p>
<p id="aSPdWz">My eye was first drawn to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2394830/Snakedate/"><em>Snakedate</em></a>, where you play as a snake looking for dates in a club. “Cruise around the club and wrap around your dates to show your affection!” <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2394830/Snakedate/">according to the game’s Steam description</a>. For some reason, it seems you are trying to date horses. Sounds great!</p>

So far, these predictions have not yet come to pass (if they prove true at all), but we <em>are</em> seeing early signs that tools like ChatGPT are being used to power bots, generate fake reviews, and stuff the web with low-grade textual filler.</p>
<p id="ZBkhrR">If you want proof, try searching Google or Twitter for the phrase “as an AI language model.” When talking to OpenAI’s ChatGPT, the system frequently uses this expression as a disclaimer, usually when it’s asked to generate banned content or give an opinion on something subjective and particularly human.

  <p id="Udee0z">WhatsApp users are no longer restricted to using their account on just a single phone.

  <p id="5HzFWN">Your super-powerful, ultra-versatile phone, tablet, or laptop suddenly becomes a lot less useful when its battery dies — which is why battery life is so important for gadgets. Whether it’s checking the battery capacity before buying something, investing in a portable power bank, or deploying special low-power modes, we’re all trying to get as much time as possible between charges.</p>
<p id="beAIcp">One of the ways to make sure device battery life is stretched as far as possible is to identify the apps that are sucking up the most power: You can then use them less, change their settings to make them less energy-demanding, or uninstall them altogether. This usually isn’t difficult to do, and it means you’ll be much more clued up about what’s draining your...</p>

  <p id="VbV22V">Joe Biden announced his reelection campaign this morning, and the Republican National Committee (RNC) has responded with an attack ad <a href="https://youtu.be/kLMMxgtxQ1Y">featuring AI-generated images</a>. </p>
<p id="NcBR23">The ad contains a series of stylistic images imagining Biden’s reelection in 2024. It suggests this will lead to a series of crises, with images depicting explosions in Taiwan after a Chinese invasion and military deployments on what are presumably US streets. </p>
<p id="2XfrIz">A small disclaimer in the top left of the frame says “built entirely with AI imagery,” while the caption underneath the YouTube video reads, “An AI-generated look into the country’s possible future if Joe Biden is re-elected in 2024.” A spokesperson for the RNC <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/04/25/rnc-slams-biden-re-election-bid-ai-generated-ad">told <em>Axios</em></a> it was the first ad of its kind put out by the...</p>

<p id="C0iSYQ">The Ryzen Z1 Extreme pairs eight of AMD’s Zen 4 CPU cores and 16 threads with 12 of its RDNA 3 graphics cores as well as 24MB of cache — and promises up to a whopping 8.6 teraflops of raw graphic performance, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578917/valve-steam-deck-nintendo-switch-xbox-series-x-ps5-spec-comparison">far closer to the 10.28 teraflops of a Sony PS5 than the 1.6 teraflops you get with a Steam Deck</a>.</p>

  <p id="6ZmJgW">The end is nigh for the Chevy Bolt. </p>
<p id="gAuxeZ">General Motors plans to end production of the Chevy Bolt EV and EUV at the end of 2023, GM CEO Mary Barra announced in an earnings call Tuesday. The company plans to use the capacity at its Orion Township, Michigan, assembly plant to build electric trucks starting in 2024. </p>
<p id="MdvPXL">The end of production of the Chevy Bolt EV and EUV is a huge blow to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/1/23150210/gm-chevy-bolt-ev-euv-price-cut-2023">affordable EV ownership</a>. The Bolt is one of the cheapest EVs currently on the market, with a starting price of around $24,000. The price could be even lower when applying the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/20/23691597/ev-tax-credit-eligible-vehicles-battery-irs-china">$7,500 EV tax credit</a>. </p>

  <p id="ZvmdPP">I was relieved when I first looked at the small map in <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>’s new expansion, <em>Burning Shores</em>.</p>
<p id="byZ9b6">Sony’s <em>Horizon</em> series is renowned for its expansive open worlds that are littered with things to do. When you look at the huge maps in both <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/20/14665114/horizon-zero-dawn-review-ps4"><em>Zero Dawn</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22929852/horizon-forbidden-west-ps5-review"><em>Forbidden West</em></a>, they’re covered with tiny icons pointing you to quests to help your fellow humans, battle with fearsome robot dinosaurs, and even just interesting places to see. You can easily spend dozens upon dozens of hours in each game and not see everything they have to offer.</p>
<p id="ddHqHz">But for me, both games just had <em>too much</em>. With each, I’ve tried to be open to exploring at my own pace and letting my curiosity lead the way, but I’d inevitably get tired of the busywork of trying to...</p>

  <p id="vey7jY">The best thing about Slack’s new Canvas feature is that I barely need to explain it to you. It’s like Google Docs but inside of Slack. Make a canvas, add some stuff, and share it with whoever you want. Every channel in your Slack now has a canvas attached to it, and you can also make and share as many as you want. That’s it!</p>
<p id="6Mc9oy">Slack <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/20/23361717/slack-canvas-documents-messaging-google-notion">first announced Canvas</a> last year, and they’re starting to roll out to all Slack users today. I’ve been testing an early version over the last few days, and they’re definitely going to be one of my more-used Slack features going forward. They’re maybe the most useful organizational tool Slack has ever created.</p>

  <p id="3DRgz6">Yelp is going to let you add video to your reviews, which could make it easier to share additional context about an experience at a location you’ve visited. Currently, you can write text and add photos, but a video might be a better way to capture ambiance or certain aspects of a place. The videos will be short — they can only be up to 12 seconds long — but I could see them being a useful tool when I’m doing some research about where to go.</p>
<p id="LapqIM">The addition of videos is just one of many new features Yelp is rolling out as part of <a href="https://blog.yelp.com/news/yelp-consumer-product-updates-april-2023/">a series of notable updates</a>.

  <p id="8pFUzn">Czech model Eva Herzigová is now a MetaHuman. The model revealed on Tuesday that there is now a digital likeness of herself in the form of one of Epic Games’ MetaHumans. According to a press release, Herzigová was scanned in a “70 camera rig” and participated in a motion capture shoot to help create the realistic digital avatar.</p>
<p id="HmlQEb">“This now means that Eva’s MetaHuman can be re-dressed, posed and lit, have her hair and make-up restyled, and her body and facial expressions are ready to be animated using motion capture or traditional animation,” the release says. Herzigová’s MetaHuman can now be used for things like virtual fashion shows and modelling digital clothes — hopefully for better fashion events <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23668846/decentraland-metaverse-fashion-week-2023">than Metaverse Fashion Week</a>.</p>
