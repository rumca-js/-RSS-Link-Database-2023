Though it's rumored the firing had something to do with the spar between him and <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/don-lemon-vivek-ramaswamy-debate\" target=\"_blank\">Vivek Ramaswamy</a>, the ladies defended him against accusations of misogyny. Y'know, due to that whole \"past her prime\" thing.</p><p>Sunny Hostin admitted she is biased, since she's been friends with Don for 20 years. But she doesn't believe he's a misogynist. Because he loves his mom. And her. </p><p><em>\"I don't believe in my experience with him that he's a misogynist. He loves his mother. He loved his sister. He loves me. He loves Joy.\"</em></p><p>Sunny admitted he has said things that were \"ageist and sexist,\" but he apologized and underwent <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/don-lemon-formal-training\" target=\"_blank\">formal training</a>. Joy jumped in to explain how Don is nothing at all like Tucker Carlson:<em> \"</em><em>He's been on the air a long time fighting bigotry, whereas Tucker has been fomenting bigotry.\"  </em>She also referred to Lemon's more questionable comments as \"dumb things.\"</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cJoy Behar comes to Lemon's aid: \"He's been on the air a long time fighting bigotry, whereas Tucker has been fomenting bigotry.\"\\nShe calls his agist, sexist, and racist comments simply \"dumb things.\"\\u201d</div> \u2014 Nicholas Fondacaro (@Nicholas Fondacaro)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NickFondacaro/status/1650887613572694017\">1682437061</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sara Haines blamed Lemon's firing on the new management. Under Chris Licht's leadership, the network has publicly announced its desire to become less partisan. Whoopi then chimed in with a real zinger, asking why, if CNN thought Don was a misogynist, did they put him on a morning show with two women?</p><p><em>\"If you're concerned that somebody is a misogynist, why would you put them with two women to do a show? If you feel that way, if you feel that concern- so for me, it seemed odd when they gave him that show, and I thought, this seems a little strange.\"</em></p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cWhoopi Goldberg bashes CNN: \"If you're concerned that somebody is a misogynist, why would you put them with two women...?\"\\nTouts her friendship with him.\\u201d</div> \u2014 Nicholas Fondacaro (@Nicholas Fondacaro)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NickFondacaro/status/1650889044551778304\">1682437061</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now, if Tucker Carlson had said women are \"past their prime\" after age 50, do you think the ladies would have the same reaction?Even if he underwent \"formal training\"? </p><p>That being said, I personally don't think Don Lemon is a misogynist.

No matter the \"reason\". </p><p>A 2016 medical article documented the death of an 18-year-old male participant in a Dutch study on <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/biden-sinful-team-desantis\" target=\"_blank\">gender transition surgeries</a>. According to The Post Millennial, the article indicates that the teen died due to puberty suppression. In reality, the teen died due to the experimental surgery he underwent. The complications that arose were due to the surgical method rendered necessary by his early pubertal suppression. So, in a roundabout way, this isn't <em>technically</em> a lie. But in a much more straightforward way, it's a lie. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cTrans teen died from vaginoplasty complications during landmark Dutch study used to justify child sex changes\\n\\nhttps://t.co/uixST6S2rA\\u201d</div> \u2014 The Post Millennial (@The Post Millennial)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TPostMillennial/status/1650867961656115206\">1682432568</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You see, the teen patient did not have enough penile tissue to construct a fake vagina, so the researchers took some from his colon. (The same thing happened to <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jazz-jennings-themselves\" target=\"_blank\">Jazz Jennings</a>, by the way, and Jazz suffered from severe complications.) This resulted in major complications just 24 hours following surgery, and eventually a diagnosis of fatal necrotizing fasciitis. The patient went into multiple organ failure and died. </p><p>The investigation into the death revealed that the deadly strain of E-coli likely came from the patient's own intestines. But despite all of this horror, the study still proclaims the greatness of these \"gender-affirming surgeries\": </p><p><em>\"Transgender women with early-onset gender dysphoria, treated with puberty suppressing hormones, report fewer behavioral and emotional problems and an improvement of general functioning.\" </em></p><p>It also assures the reader that \"vaginal reconstruction\" has a \"positive influence\" on the quality of life of \u201cnon-transgender and transgender women.\" To its credit, it cautions doctors and patients against complications that may arise. Like death. </p><p>I am honestly at a loss for words. This story is so appalling, it seems like it came right out of a horror movie. But no, it's what the left claims is the \"compassionate\" approach to treating gender dysphoria. It has got to stop. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Lily is a Zoomer college dropout who somehow landed a writing gig here at LwC.com.

Let\u2019s finish the job.\"</em></p><p>Ah yes, nothing says \"democracy,\"  like the attempted imprisonment of your <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/trump-indictment-too-much-taxes\" target=\"_blank\">political opposition</a>. And nothing says \"fundamental freedoms\" like the <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nyc-teachers-fbi\" target=\"_blank\">forced injection</a> of a novel, experimental technology. </p><p><em>\"Freedom,\" </em>Biden says in the video, after a montage of videos from January 6th, and a woman holding a sign that says \"Abortion is healthcare.\" </p><p><em>\"Personal freedom is fundamental to who we are as Americans. There's nothing more important. Nothing more sacred. That's been the work of my first term. To fight for our democracy. This shouldn't be a red or blue issue.\"</em></p><p><em>\"To protect our rights. To make sure that everyone in this country is treated equally, and everyone is given a fair shot at making it.\"</em></p><p>It then cuts back to January 6th. The darkest day in the history of our \"democracy\".</p><p><em>\"But you know, around the country, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/north-dakota-man-bail\" target=\"_blank\">MAGA extremists</a> are lining up to take on those bedrock freedoms. Cutting Social Security, that you've paid for your entire life, while cutting taxes for the very wealthy. Dictating what healthcare decisions women can make. Banning books and telling people who they can love. All while making it more difficult for you to be able to vote.\" </em></p><p>I wouldn't consider myself an \"extremist\". But last I checked, Social Security is not a \"fundamental freedom.\" Nor is being taxed out of existence. And murder isn't a healthcare decision, children's books shouldn't contain pornography, marriage is between a man and a woman, and a person should have to identify themselves in order to vote.
