We don\u2019t. The Seven Last Words are a harmonisation that unites quotes from the different accounts of the crucifixion in the four gospels to create a single narrative in the shape of these seven sentences. Together, the words provide the complete spiritual architecture of Christian existence. No wonder they have inspired composers for centuries. <br /><br />The tradition of setting them to music evolved out of medieval Passion settings. An extraordinary early example is <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/4JK1rhgtq4eg1IDSoMqSCa?si=R-GvEorDTxWazt-PbRWU5g\">Maria Plena Virtute</a>, written circa 1510, by Robert Fayrfax, one of Tudor England\u2019s most significant composers. The Latin text contains six of the seven last words (and paraphrases the seventh) in an intimate meditation on the Passion story that moves between narrative and personal contemplation. <br /><br />Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/2raKAYAQTMIGju73TxAvgu?si=mBjquJq3S6i2Zj84XUoZLQ\">Heinrich Sch\u00fctz\u2019s setting</a> from 1645, widely considered to be the first complete musical setting of the Seven Last Words, creates immediacy through characterisation. We have moved from Renaissance polyphony to baroque oratorio. Jesus is sung by a solo tenor. A choral prelude and postlude offer commentary; narrative is delivered in recitative-like passages. For me, something of the text\u2019s secret power is lost in this formalised dramatic structure, but the laser-sharp clarity of how Sch\u00fctz sets the German vernacular text, (compiled from the Luther Bible) is an inspiration. <br /><br />When it came to setting the Welsh, I used a simple, unadorned approach, similar to plainchant \u2013 the unaccompanied early Christian musical tradition of chanting the liturgy in unison, which is also a feature of <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/1JL45GYpZvXMlG7kJgjxqt?si=MOr90i1ZS1qbb797lDq6IQ&amp;nd=1\">James MacMillan\u2019s mesmerising setting from 1994</a>. My aim was for a clear and direct, yet solemn, presentation of the powerful text, which is taken from the first complete translation of the Bible into Welsh by William Morgan, published in 1588.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/07/seven-last-words-of-christ-welsh-bangor-cathedral-alex-mills\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/07/seven-last-words-of-christ-welsh-bangor-cathedral-alex-mills", "date_published": "2023-04-07 07:00:47+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Royals made almost \u00a32m from sale of horses received as gifts from prominent figures", "description": "<p>Palace insists horses given to late queen, including 34 from emir of Dubai, were \u2018personal gifts\u2019</p><p>King Charles III and his late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, appear to have made almost \u00a32m from the sale of horses that were gifts from prominent figures.</p><p>The Guardian has identified more than 40 horses that were apparently given to the queen by a Dubai sheikh, a Muslim religious leader and a Saudi royal.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/07/royals-made-almost-2m-from-sale-of-horses-received-as-gifts-from-prominent-figures\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/07/royals-made-almost-2m-from-sale-of-horses-received-as-gifts-from-prominent-figures", "date_published": "2023-04-07 07:00:46+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Stopping breastfeeding my baby offers a bittersweet relief |  Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett", "description": "<p>My journey through mixed feeding has been painful and beautiful in equal measure</p><p>It\u2019s more than a year since I had my baby and I\u2019m still breastfeeding.
