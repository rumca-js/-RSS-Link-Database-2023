<p>Featuring a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tabletop-news-aims-to-be-the-go-to-spot-for-ttrpg-fans-recruits-powerful-cast-of-hosts/1100-6511821/">powerful cast of hosts</a>, Tabletop News is aiming to bring a consolidated weekly news show to the tabletop gaming space. Though not a wholly original concept--websites like Dicebreakers and podcasts like The Dice Tower cover press releases and announcements within the tabletop gaming space--Tabletop News is looking to differentiate itself by solely focusing on news stories and delivering them in concise 12-minute long episodes.</p><p dir="ltr">To get a better understanding of what Two Kings Entertainment is hoping to accomplish with Tabletop News and what the team behind the show wants to achieve within the industry, I sat down to talk with Two Kings Entertainment executive producer Adam Rady and Tabletop News producer and host Michelle Nguyen Bradley. The two answered my questions about why the tabletop community needs a show like this, why they're opting to launch through a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/watchtabletop/tabletopnews">Kickstarter campaign</a>, and how Tabletop News is designed to be approachable for--as Rady puts it--the "curious gamer."</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr"><strong>I don't know how much of this you can speak to, but why did y'all feel like now is the time?

## Take Notes, Sony And Microsoft: Nintendo Has Made Buying Switch Gift Cards Less Miserable

<p dir="ltr">I never would have expected Nintendo to outdo the competition when it comes to something connected with its online services. But it turns out that's very much the case with gift cards.</p><p dir="ltr">I am a digital game enthusiast. I recognize the downsides of digital "ownership," be it the potential for companies to cut off your access on a whim, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/04/arts/dahl-christie-stine-kindle-edited.html">change the text of your books</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/3ds-and-wii-u-eshops-are-shutting-down-today/1100-6512734/">outright refuse your money</a>, or otherwise demonstrate the ephemeral, you're-actually-only-licensing it nature of the medium. But when it comes to playing games, I am lazy and impulsive: I oftentimes want to switch between a bunch of different games in rapid succession, and, well, my back hurts, and I don't want to get up each and every time and switch a new disc in, as much as my cat loves to see those get sucked into or pop out of a console. And I especially don't want to be in a different <em>room </em>from my game collection if I'm carrying my Switch around my house. The very thought gives me chills.</p><p dir="ltr">As such, I've switched almost exclusively to buying digital games. Digital storefronts on consoles, and especially the Switch eShop, are far less likely to offer the same quality of deals as you find on physical games, so I'm forced to make my own deals. That primarily involves buying gift cards when they go on sale--the best offers usually knock the price down by 20%, which means getting 20% off of whatever I ultimately buy (and that stacks on top of any sales these digital stores might offer). It's the best way to save money without sacrificing that digital convenience I so desperately crave.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-notes-sony-and-microsoft-nintendo-has-made-buying-switch-gift-cards-less-miserable/1100-6513092/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Fortnite Lantern Fest Slippery Slide And All Parkour Challenge Locations

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> is keeping the Lantern Fest Event rolling with some new quests, including one that asks you to complete three parkour challenges on Lantern Fest Tour Island. These will test your platforming capabilities and reflexes quite a bit, but we'll tell you where to find them, including the Slippery Slide, and give you a general idea of what you're up against fo your 40,000 XP.</p><h2>All parkour challenge locations and how to beat them</h2><p>You can find the Parkour Paradise tent housing the three parkour challenges on the west side of the island just past the Slurp Juice shop. It should be noted, however, that <strong>completing the Slippery Slide course at the very back end (north) of the island will also reward you with progress toward your three parkour challenges</strong>.</p><figure style="width: 3840px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4123298-fortnite_20230407160551.jpg"><img alt="Parkour Paradise" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4123298-fortnite_20230407160551.jpg" /></a><figcaption>Parkour Paradise</figcaption></figure><h3>Jungle Trip</h3><p>You'll first have to jump over some logs here, which the game seems almost determined to make impossible due to the fact that Fortnite isn't exactly designed for platforming. If you can manage to jump just right and hold the button to mantle, you may be able to sort of make your way through it with janky mantling, but good luck.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-lantern-fest-slippery-slide-and-all-parkour-challenge-locations/1100-6513090/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Third-Person Call Of Duty-Meets-Uncharted Vietnam Game Never Got Very Far In Development

<p>Years ago, Sledgehammer Games was working on a third-person Call of Duty game set during the Vietnam War. But it never came to be. A developer who worked on the game, Bret Robbins, shared some new details on the project in an interview with MinnMax and also confirmed that Sledgehammer did, indeed, start working on Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare 2 before shifting gears.</p><p>Robbins said the unannounced third-person Call of Duty game was "almost like an Uncharted-meets-Call of Duty idea." The game never materialized, though, because Sledgehammer got pulled in to help Infinity Ward finish Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III after the major shakeup at Infinity Ward that saw its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/top-infinity-ward-devs-fired-for-insubordination-lawsuits-expected/1100-6252657/">top bosses get fired for alleged insubordination. </a></p><div>          </div><p>"We did a prototype for it and we made a demo. It was cool. It was fun. I think someone should go make that game someday," Robbins said.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/third-person-call-of-duty-meets-uncharted-vietnam-game-never-got-very-far-in-development/1100-6513089/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Costco Membership Comes With Free $30 Gift Card Right Now

<p>If you’re lucky enough to live near a Costco, you have an easy way to save on not just groceries, but also video games, electronics, and other household products. The bulk retailer frequently holds members-only discounts--and back when PS5 and Xbox Series X consoles were scarce, Costco was one of the best places to look. You need to be a member to shop most of the sales, but an ongoing promotion is giving away <b>$30 gift cards</b> when signing up for a <span class="norewrite">           <a href="https://deals.gamespot.com/sales/costco-1-year-gold-star-membership-30-costco-card?utm_source=gamespot.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=costco-1-year-gold-star-membership-30-costco-card_020923&amp;utm_term=scsf-565326&amp;utm_content=a0x1P0000058JsWQAU&amp;scsonar=1">Gold Membership,</a> </span> making this a great time to join.</p><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://deals.gamespot.com/sales/costco-1-year-gold-star-membership-30-costco-card?utm_source=gamespot.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=costco-1-year-gold-star-membership-30-costco-card_020923&amp;utm_term=scsf-565326&amp;utm_content=a0x1P0000058JsWQAU&amp;scsonar=1">Sign Up For Costco Gold</a> </div><p> </p><p>This Costco promotion comes with a few caveats. You’ll want to read the lengthy fine print, but the main takeaway is that <strong>only new members</strong> are eligible for the free gift card. But if you’ve never been part of the Costco family, you’d be hard-pressed to find a better time to join. An annual Gold Membership typically costs $60, but with a free $30 digital gift card, this essentially cuts that to just $30.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/costco-membership-comes-with-free-30-gift-card-right-now/1100-6511477/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Jack Black Wants Pedro Pascal To Play Wario In The Next Mario Movie

<p>If there is a single character who can be considered the main antagonist of the Super Mario Bros. video game franchise, it's Bowser. And, after one movie, he's also the main antagonist of the brand-new Super Mario Bros. Movie franchise, too. But that doesn't mean he'll for sure be the main baddie in the next movie. Or at least that's what Jack Black, who plays Bowser in The Super Mario Bros. Movie, wants you to think. And he's got a specific person in mind who could make quite a villainous splash in the next one: Pedro Pascal.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's not a given that Bowser will return. You know, I did a few Kung Fu Panda movies, and it was a different villain every movie. They may do the same thing," Black said.</p><p dir="ltr">In response, I suggested that Mario could pull a Fast &amp; Furious #family maneuver on Bowser and turn him into a good guy. Black seemed to like that idea enough to run with it.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jack-black-wants-pedro-pascal-to-play-wario-in-the-next-mario-movie/1100-6513087/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy has clarified the situation surrounding Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige's rumored Star Wars movie. Speaking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qz6s7kvuwMc">IGN</a>, Kennedy said Feige is a big Star Wars fan but there was never a real discussion about making a movie.</p><p>"Kevin Feige's project was something that was announced in the press... but nothing ever got developed. We never discussed an idea," Kennedy said. "As everyone knows, Kevin is a huge Star Wars fan. If he did come up with something, I would be all ears. But that's never really happened. It's not an abandoned project--it just didn't happen."</p><p>According to press reports, Feige was going to produce a Star Wars movie, but no official announcement was ever made about this. In March this year, a report said Feige's rumored Star Wars movie had been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-movies-from-kevin-feige-patty-jenkins-shelved-report/1100-6512130/">shelved</a>.

<p>There are a lot of fish to catch in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/disney-dreamlight-valley/">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a>, and some are more elusive than others. However, the Pride of the Valley update added a fish that may be giving you even more trouble than some of the game's other rare catches. As a matter of fact, the new Here and There Fish won't be able to be caught at all until you've met certain criteria. Here's how to reel one in.</p><h2>How to catch a Here and Now Fish in Disney Dreamlight Valley</h2><p>You may have seen the Here and Now Fish in your collections tab and noticed it says it can be caught everywhere--and that's partially true. However, before you can begin reeling this funny-looking fish in, you'll first need to recruit Nala to your valley by opening the Lion King realm and going through her questline.</p><p>Once you have Nala as a resident in your valley, you'll have to get her to friendship level 10 and begin the quest "Here and There and Back Again." This quest will ask you to speak with Ursula, who gives you three Enchanted Hearts and then tells you to craft some lioness statues. Here's what you'll need:</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-how-to-catch-a-here-and-there-fish/1100-6513047/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Actor Andy Serkis has shared his thoughts on the fate of his Andor character, Kino Loy. The character played a significant role in Andor, and fans are wondering if we'll see him again in Season 2. In a new interview, Serkis shared his own personal thoughts about what's to come.</p><p><strong>This story contains spoilers about Andor Season 1.</strong></p><div>          </div><p>In a pivotal plot line from Andor Season 1, Kino Loy helps Cassian (Diego Luna) break out of a jail in the middle of the ocean. Cassian and other inmates breathe fresh air and leap into the water below in an attempt to swim to freedom. But Kino cannot swim and is left behind. We never see what happens to Kino, and by the rules of Hollywood, if a character is not shown to be explicitly dead, they may not be. So is Kino still alive? Serkis believes he is.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/andor-actor-andy-serkis-discusses-kino-loys-fate-as-fans-hope-for-answers-in-season-2/1100-6513081/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Destiny 2 is always evolving, but if there's one reassuring constant in its design, it's a visit from Xur every Friday.

For his weapon, Xur is offering <strong>Sunshot</strong>. Hunters can pick up <strong>The Dragon's Shadow </strong>chest armor; Titans can grab the <strong>Helm of Saint-14 </strong>helmet; and for Warlocks, Xur has <strong>Transversive Steps </strong>leg armor.</p><h2>Xur Location</h2><figure style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4123190-xurnessus.jpg"><img alt="Xur's location on Nessus." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4123190-xurnessus.jpg" /></a><figcaption>Xur's location on Nessus.</figcaption></figure><p>Head to Nessus and use the Watcher's Grave transmat zone to find Xur this week.

<p>Fans of the long-running, high-octane Fast &amp; Furious franchise were given a sneak peek into the upcoming Fast X, as a new making-of promotional video was released on Friday. The video aims to shed some light on how the series will begin to wrap up the saga with this next movie.</p><p dir="ltr">"I've never seen a movie like this," says Vin Diesel. Michelle Rodrgiuez adds, "We're revving to give you everything we got," emphasizing the dedication of the cast and crew to making this movie a success--and one of countless vehicular puns pretty much everyone throws down in the new clip. Check it out below.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">Jason Momoa takes on the role of the new antagonist, Dante. Momoa, who is known for his roles in Game of Thrones and Aquaman, shares that in going up against Dominic Toretto and his family, Dante needed to possess a dangerous level of deviant behavior. Momoa explains, "To face off against Dom and his family, you had to be a certain psychotic. He's coming for you with everything… [he's] one angry guy, but really well-dressed."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-fast-x-video-showcases-some-of-the-big-stunts-and-action-set-pieces/1100-6513080/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor releases on April 28, and with the game's release coming up soon, we've learned a lot about what to expect from the Star Wars title--but not everything. A very important piece of news has been confirmed for Jedi: Survivor, and that is whether or not players can pet the Bogling. Thankfully for fans, the Bogling can, indeed, be pet in Respawn's new Star Wars title.</p><p>The PlayStation UK Twitter account confirmed this extremely important piece of information and shared a video of said petting in action. As you can see, main character Cal Kestis crouches down and scruffs the creature's fur, eliciting a playful and happy sound from the little critter.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">Yes, you can pet the... *checks notes* Bogling 🐾<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StarWarsJediSurvivor?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc^tfw">#StarWarsJediSurvivor</a> <a href="https://t.co/9uv0z5oe6y">pic.twitter.com/9uv0z5oe6y</a></p>  — PlayStation UK (@PlayStationUK) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStationUK/status/1644339446937001984?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">April 7, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p>A Bogling is a tunneling creature native to the planet Bogano.

<p dir="ltr">By all accounts, Resident Evil 4 is not only set to be one of the best games of 2023, but also one of the best remakes of all time. The recent update that added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-4-free-mercenaries-dlc-is-available-now/1100-6513064/">The Mercenaries mode</a> to RE4 also added another unexpected feature: microtransactions.</p><p dir="ltr">This optional paid DLC comes in the form of Upgrade Tickets, which allow the player to upgrade any weapon of their choosing for free, including the all-important exclusive upgrade. Each ticket costs $3, with optional multi-packs allowing players to buy three or five at a discount.</p><p dir="ltr">It should go without saying that the original Resident Evil 4 did not feature microtransactions when it was released in 2005, as the feature had not yet become a part of console gaming and the GameCube wasn't an online console. Capcom did not indicate that this remake would add microtransactions to the game, but since they're an optional single-player feature, at least you don't have to mess about with them if you don't want to.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-4s-remake-now-lets-you-pay-real-money-to-upgrade-weapons/1100-6513067/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Is Bo-Katan Shaping Up To Be The Mandalorian's New Protagonist?

<p>The Mandalorian Season 3 feels different than its first two seasons. Previously, we were aware of what the end goal was for protagonist Din Djarin, but this time around the running narrative seems to be shrouded in mystery as it continues to focus on multiple points of view. There's been criticism that there's "no plot" this season with no clear end in sight, but if we look at the big picture, one thing is certain: Season 3 has made a point of making Bo-Katan Kryze a more key figure than ever before.</p><p dir="ltr">From aiding Mando in redeeming himself in the Living Waters in the mines of Mandalore, to inadvertently joining the Children of the Watch, to heading a rescue for a kidnapped foundling, to even leading a strike on Nevarro, and most recently becoming the bearer of the Darksaber, it's clear that Bo-Katan's path is potentially leading to something bigger than we've previously realized.</p><p dir="ltr">Din completed his quest in bringing Grogu to the Jedi during the Season 2 finale, during which he won the Darksaber from Moff Gideon--technically declaring himself the rightful ruler of Mandalore. When this was brought to Bo's attention, her reaction made it clear that she felt that she'd failed once again in her mission to unite her people. When we meet Bo again in Chapter 17, she has chosen to live in solitude in Kryze Castle. She's alone, with no goals and no idea what her next move should be.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-bo-katan-shaping-up-to-be-the-mandalorians-new-protagonist/1100-6513053/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Disney Speedstorm Is A Great Kart Racer Mired In Confusing Progression Hooks

<p dir="ltr">Gameloft is a mobile-first studio with loads of experience making snappy, responsive racing games through its Asphalt series. Disney Speedstorm represents its second venture into PC and console gaming using the popular Disney license, after the friendly life sim Disney Dreamlight Valley. And while Gameloft's expertise in crafting well-made racing games is on full display--complete with plenty of fun callbacks for Disney fans--it also feels like it has imported some of the confusing microtransaction baggage familiar from the mobile market.</p><p dir="ltr">As a racer, Disney Speedstorm carries itself with an earned level of confidence, nailing the feeling of a veteran kart racer right from the start. The cars here are sized similarly to actual small automobiles--at least, as far as I can tell from the proportions of human characters--which is more reminiscent of the Sonic Racing series than the tiny, zippy go-karts from Mario Kart. The vehicles grip the road well and take sharp corners with well-calibrated drifting mechanics. If you've played a kart racer or even just any arcade racing game in the last few years, you'll feel immediately at home stepping behind this wheel.</p><p dir="ltr">Where it starts to differentiate itself is with its variety of characters, each with their own classes and special abilities. These include the differences that you'd expect to stats like handling or top speed, but the classes also make a much bigger impact by changing mechanics like how you gather boost. Your boost meter is a major part of the racing strategy in Speedstorm, and each class is built to gain its boost function differently. Brawlers, for example, get boost when they successfully stun an opponent, which means they excel when they're in the middle of the action, while Defenders gain boost from drifting off their opponents' slipstreams.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-speedstorm-is-a-great-kart-racer-mired-in-confusing-progression-hooks/1100-6513043/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## DC/Marvel Movie Crossover Is More Likely Under James Gunn, Who Says DC Has Discussed It

<p>James Gunn, the co-head of DC Studios, has said there have been "very light" discussions about a potential DC/Marvel crossover. Gunn wrote and directed the Guardians of the Galaxy film series for Marvel before switching teams to DC to become its new co-CEO alongside Peter Safran. Given his history, Gunn would appear to be well-suited to at least help the conversation about a crossover take place, but whether or not it ever comes to fruition is another matter.</p><p>Gunn told <a href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/james-gunn-talks-potential-marvel-dc-crossover-exclusive/">Empire</a> that he is "certain" the chances of a DC/Marvel crossover are greater now that he is a leader at DC Studios and would presumably be one of the key people involved in those discussions. However, any potential crossover wouldn't happen anytime soon.</p><p>"That's many years away, though," he said. "I think we have to establish what we're doing [at DC] first. I would be lying to say that we haven't discussed it. But all discussions have been very, very light and fun."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dc-marvel-movie-crossover-is-more-likely-under-james-gunn-who-says-dc-has-discussed-it/1100-6513065/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>With Star Wars Celebration taking place in London right now, one of the big opening day reveals was for the Star Wars TV series The Acolyte. Described as "Frozen meets Kill Bill," The Acolyte goes hundreds of years into the past of Star Wars and is set during the final days of the High Republic era.</p><p>No exact date was given for when the series will arrive on Disney+, but creator Leslye Headland did appear on stage to talk about the show. Joined by cast members Amandla Stenberg, Lee Jung-jae, Manny Jacinto, Dafne Keen, Charlie Barnett, Rebecca Henderson, Jodie Turner-Smith, and Joonas Suotamo, Headland explained how The Acolyte is set in a galaxy where the bad guys find themselves massively outnumbered.</p><p>The High Republic era is notable for being the age when the Jedi Order was at its most powerful, and Headland explained that she was excited to tell a story from the perspective of the bad guys. At this time in the Star Wars timeline, the Jedi Order is at its peak and fans will see "lots of Jedi" Headland said. Chewbacca actor Joonas Suotamo will play a Wookie Jedi, which Headland added has always been a dream story for her to tell.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-star-wars-the-acolyte-details-pitch-the-show-as-frozen-meets-kill-bill/1100-6513063/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
