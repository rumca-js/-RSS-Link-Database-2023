When the Ministry of Housing and Construction announced that there were nearly 600 million residential buildings in the country, it shocked the public. Please note that this is 600 million buildings, not 600 million homes. One building contains multiple homes. One home usually accommodates 3-4 people or more.
The bundling of local finance with the real estate sector is a major headache for the Chinese government and one that is difficult to solve. So far the CCP has been unable to solve it, and the real estate market could deteriorate further, hitting the Chinese economy hard.
