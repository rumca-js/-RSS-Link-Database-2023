## Jimi Hendrix Live in Lviv by Andrey Kurkov review – ode to a lost city

<p>First published in 2012 and now translated into English, a whimsical love letter to Ukraine’s cultural capital from the author of Death and the Penguin</p><p>It was a sad day in 2019 when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/dec/12/hendrix-hepburn-study-busts-myths-about-origins-of-uks-parakeets" title="">scientists finally scotched the urban myth</a> that London’s many wild parakeets are descended from a pair of pet birds released by Jimi Hendrix in his Carnaby Street days. Luckily, in his newly translated novel, the Ukrainian writer Andrey Kurkov rides to the rescue with some Hendrix lore of his own invention. According to the book, which has been longlisted for the International Booker prize, the guitar hero’s right hand was smuggled into the USSR with the connivance of the KGB and buried in a corner of Lychakiv cemetery in Lviv, western Ukraine. As a consequence, every year, on 18 September, the anniversary of Hendrix’s death, ageing fans from across the former Soviet Union gather at the cemetery to pay tribute.</p><p>This conceit gives Kurkov an excuse to remind us about the existence of an almost forgotten aspect of Soviet subculture: its hippies. Sticking it to the man was a much more perilous activity in Brezhnev’s USSR than it was in Haight-Ashbury.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/08/jimi-hendrix-live-in-lviv-by-andrey-kurkov-review-ode-to-a-lost-city">Continue reading...</a>

<p>My friend Ken Cook, who has died aged 78 after a fall, was a foundryman. There are not many such artists in England today, and few in the world, to equal his skill. He made <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2009/nov/09/art-lost-wax-sculpture">lost-wax casting</a> better than most, and famous sculptors would attend his outstanding workshops.</p><p>Ken described himself a plagiarist – he would work collaboratively, taking another sculptor’s work and altering the surface. He would listen keenly to his sculptor clients, looking for concise and insightful finishing, chiselling, hammering, moulding, welding and polishing skills. Ken’s unusual patinas were in contrast to the majority of bronzes produced elsewhere, and his craftsmanship is reflected in the reputation of the artists Ken worked with: <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-dame-elisabeth-frink-1456195.html">Elisabeth Frink</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Christopher">Ann Christopher</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/may/09/ralph-brown">Ralph Brown</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jul/04/leonard-mccomb-obituary">Leonard McComb</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/mar/30/robert-clatworthy">Robert Clatworthy</a>, to name a few.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/07/ken-cook-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<ul><li>American three shots clear after second round 67</li><li>Northern Irishman set to exit after hitting 77</li></ul><p>Seventeen shots separated Brooks Koepka and Rory McIlroy by the time the Northern Irishman reached Augusta National’s scoring hut at the end of round two. Perhaps confirmation of a missed cut, not yet forthcoming because of weather interruptions in Augusta, would spare McIlroy the hassle of playing 36 holes of a major he knew he could no longer win.</p><p>McIlroy’s 77 was his highest round here since day three of the 2016 Masters. Added to Thursday’s 72, this served as his latest wounding experience in this corner of Georgia. McIlroy needs ‘only’ the Masters to become the sixth golfer in history to claim a clean sweep of major titles; the lingering sense is that the weight of history sits too heavily on his shoulders. His wait for a fifth major title, a gnawing wait stretching back to August 2014, goes on. No wonder the 33-year-old, shoulders slumped, looked a dejected soul.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/apr/07/brooks-koepka-forges-masters-lead-while-rory-mcilroy-faces-missing-cut">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The former Manchester City player’s smart recruitment and attacking mindset have revitalised the club after the Dyche era</p><p>It looked like a marriage of convenience when Vincent Kompany returned to the north-west of England to take up the role of Burnley manager last summer. The former Belgium defender had spent an illustrious 11 years down the road in Manchester, where he had met his Mancunian wife and brought up children whom he was bringing home. But following Friday’s 2-1 victory at Middlesbrough, now he can add promotion to the Premier League to his romantic regional ties.</p><p>The Clarets had spent a decade <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/19/sean-dyche-burnley-manager-premier-league">under the rule of Sean Dyche,</a> which petered out with his sacking and the club’s relegation last May.

<p>Every contender to have conquered Anfield between February and May has gone on to win the league. Are the Gunners next?</p><p>These days, for reasons of practicality as much as anything else, you very rarely see a team deciding to switch ends after the pre-match coin toss. But in 2018, in a Champions League quarter-final against Liverpool at Anfield, Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City did. In one of English football’s first recorded instances of a Pep overthink, City decided to switch ends to prevent Liverpool from being able to attack their favoured Kop end during the second half. Genius. Instead, Liverpool <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/04/liverpool-manchester-city-champions-league-quarter-final-first-leg-match-report">banged in three goals in the first 30 minutes</a>, and went on to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/10/manchester-city-liverpool-champions-league-match-report">win 5-1 on aggregate</a>.</p><p>Sitting on the City bench that night was assistant coach, Mikel Arteta, who had already endured his own harrowing Anfield experience a few years earlier. In 2014, Arsenal were still chasing that elusive league title when they visited Anfield for a Saturday 12.45pm kick-off. By 1.05pm they were 4-0 down, their gameplan in ruins, a sensory overload of red shirts and white noise having temporarily interrupted the function of their limbs. Arteta was Arsenal’s captain that day and would testify after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/08/liverpool-arsenal-premier-league">the 5-1 defeat</a> that he had never seen Arsène Wenger so angry.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/07/arsenal-take-on-history-and-liverpool-voodoo-with-elusive-title-in-sight">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With growing concerns inside as well as outside industry, it is clear that counting on developers to police themselves is not sufficient</p><p>The horse has not merely bolted; it is halfway down the road and picking up speed – and no one is sure where it’s heading. The potential benefits of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/24/ai-artificial-intelligence-chatbots-to-deepfakes" title="">artificial intelligence</a> – such as developing lifesaving drugs – are undeniable.

The shock is not only <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/15/what-is-gpt-4-and-how-does-it-differ-from-chatgpt" title="">how greatly the technology has progressed</a>, but how fast it has done so.

A day later <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-65139406" title="">Italy</a> became the first western country to temporarily ban ChatGPT. Full-scale legislation will take time.

## The Guardian view on House of Lords reform: an irresistible case | Ediitorial

<p>Britain’s upper house is too big, unworthily appointed, and does not work. Reform has become inevitable, whether the political parties like it or not</p><p>Having only been an MP since 2019, Scott Benton has probably not yet set his sights on a peerage. These days, though, who can be sure? Mr Benton has been suspended as a Conservative MP this week after offering to lobby ministers for a <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/tory-mp-scott-benton-lobbying-investigation-ckhzrfqg0" title="">fake gambling company</a>. His Commons career hangs in the balance. But he need not give up all hope. Judging by today’s contemptible Lords appointment system, and by the system’s resistance to change, even Mr Benton is still in with a shot of eventual ermine.</p><p>House of Lords reform is often regarded in political circles as a niche subject, of great fascination to constitutional anoraks but of no serious interest to ordinary voters. That could be about to alter. There are three main reasons. The current appointments system makes things worse. The system is being increasingly abused to reward unworthy donors, cronies and time servers. And any new Labour government will have to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/dec/29/donors-cronies-lackeys-case-abolish-lords-reform-labour-boris-johnson" title="">make changes </a>in order to govern effectively, even if it does not see the issue as a priority.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/07/the-guardian-view-on-house-of-lords-reform-an-irresistible-case">Continue reading...</a>

Their songs were peppy, sugary and loaded with gleeful generalities about reaching for the stars and forgetting about your cares. For the majority of their lineup, and for most of the pop stars at the time, landing a place in a pop act was the fulfilment of a childhood dream, or the perfect chance to escape a mundane job. S Club member Bradley McIntosh, for example, was working in a Pizza Hut when he got the call. For Paul Cattermole, the band’s most enigmatic member, who died on 6 April aged 46, there was no clamouring for an audition. He was scouted at his musical theatre school – at a time when his first rock band were playing small shows – and thrust into the world of pop.</p><p>Even in the group’s official book, 7 Heaven, released in 2001 after the band had scored seven Top 3 singles in a row and starred in three hugely successful CBBC TV shows, Cattermole’s description of being picked for the band is matter-of-fact: “I was asked to audition for the band and I got in – it’s as simple as that!”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/07/paul-cattermole-s-club-7-wild-card">Continue reading...</a>

Plus letters from <strong>Fiona Morgan</strong>, <strong>Julie Box</strong> and <strong>Alix Dearing</strong></p><p>I read with interest your editorial on the failures in obesity management in the UK (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/04/the-guardian-view-on-obesity-prevention-is-as-important-as-cure" title="">4 April</a>). I would suggest that the problem is wider than the scope addressed. Obesity is not simply correlated with poverty. In children, it is almost exclusively a disease of poverty. We simply do not see affluent children suffering in this way. Given that the rates in children are already higher than in adults and climbing, this must be addressed to prevent a social and economic tragedy in the future.</p><p>The magic bullet problem is not restricted to jabs and pills. Obesity surgery – taking away the patient’s free will to compel them to eat a severely calorie restricted diet via surgical ablation of parts of the gastrointestinal tract – is an objectively monstrous intervention and yet has slipped under the ethical radar and is widely accepted because, to some degree, it can work (with many, many caveats).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/apr/07/obesity-is-a-symptom-of-a-society-that-doesnt-care">Continue reading...</a>

Fashion journalist and illustrator who helped transform Tatler magazine into a leading glossy<p>The preferred medium of the fashion journalist Michael Roberts was Canson art paper, which he scissored freehand into crisp-cut collages, or snipped into minute dots to reassemble into mosaics, for magazine covers or book illustrations. His art, bit by bit putting it together, reflected his life in fashion. He wrote about it, commissioned unexpected others to do so, photographed for media and ads, and charmed cranky legendary lensmen into snapping for him. He could source the clothes, choose the crazy locale, stage the shoot’s story, and write a witty critique of the enterprise. He was also always the most elegant person involved, effortlessly cool.</p><p>Roberts, who has died aged 75, never bothered with a résumé, since every new role or venture seemed to just develop, but they totted up to a serious career. He was a writer on the Sunday Times in the 1970s, when new couture catwalk drama and heightened designer celebrity demanded a fashion voice that was both theatre critic and gossip columnist. Then from 1979 he was art and style director of Tatler magazine, when the editor, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/14/the-vanity-fair-diaries-1983-92-by-tina-brown-review" title="">Tina Brown</a>, transformed it from a country house title into the shiniest glossy – he and she both believed that fashion in print was a money-based transaction, here today and gone tomorrow, where style was an attitude, a behaviour, yet permanent. They were mickey-takers, out for mischief. Roberts could persuade even an institution like Eton college to cooperate in its own mockery, though his best joke, for a cover, was to dress, style and photograph – complete to a flash of doubt in her eyes – <a href="https://www.dazeddigital.com/fashion/article/33363/1/vivienne-westwood-on-that-time-she-dressed-up-as-thatcher" title="">Vivienne Westwood impersonating Margaret Thatcher</a> in 1989, towards the end of her reign. An inspired caricaturist, he could similarly make over the designer Rifat Ozbek into the dragon empress editor Diana Vreeland, and a drag queen into Dusty Springfield. The fake could transmute to the real through style.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/apr/07/michael-roberts-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>The Weston Gallery, Yorkshire Sculpture Park<br /></strong>This show, inspired by the soap’s notorious murder plotline, looks like it was a lot of fun to put together – but sadly there’s little here for the viewer</p><p>Anyone who has seen Lindsey Mendick’s glistening, obscene ceramics knows she has talent to burn. Unfortunately, in her most ambitious show to date, she does just that and takes a torch to her abilities, wasting them in a misguided installation that makes no sense, has no point and leaves you standing frustrated and numb on the outside of what looks to have been a very enjoyable creative process.</p><p>Although surrounded by sheep and statues amid Yorkshire Sculpture Park’s rolling dales, this is an indoor exhibition in a squarish, windowless gallery, which Mendick has filled with a big hollow frame of beams, planks and joists that suggests a half-finished suburban housing estate. It is meant to suggest the Merseyside close where the Channel 4 soap Brookside was set, running from 1982 until its cancellation in 2003. Mendick peppers her deconstructed “Brookside Close” with memories of this old show’s golden moments, including a sofa fabric printed with Anna Friel snogging Nicola Stephenson.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/07/lindsey-mendick-review-the-weston-gallery-yorkshire-sculpture-park-brookside">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Comedian and presenter Joe Lycett has birthed what feels like an instant classic – knowingly modern, goofy and refreshingly hectic</p><p>If there was going to be someone to reinvigorate the chatshow, of <em>course</em> it would be Joe Lycett. Right from its hectically surreal opening titles, his new Friday-night Channel 4 show Late Night Lycett harks back to the zany charm of grassroots, Boosh-era television. Surprised-looking pigeons and grainy rainbow emojis whorl across a psychedelic graphic, culminating with retina-shattering neon letters grandly displaying the phrase “LIVE FROM BIRMINGHAM” – an instant chuckle, and a perfect elevator pitch for Lycett’s knowing, ironic sense of humour. “Hello, you bastards!” he yells, from amid a crowd of drag queens.</p><p>With a commanding presence, Lycett makes it immediately clear that he<em> </em>is the star. He’s the driver of this runaway train, sparkling cogs and wheels pinging off in unpredictable directions. His audience is all seated or stood on one level in a twinkling, labyrinthine space at historic Birmingham venue The Bond, which gives more of a 2am Edinburgh fringe showcase vibe than network chatshow. It makes the whole thing feel all the more ad-hoc, fresh and dangerous – no bad thing in a world where Jimmy Fallon is currently grinning his way waxily to the 2,000th<em> </em>episode<em> </em>of The Tonight Show.</p><p>Late Night Lycett airs on Friday nights at 10pm on Channel 4 and is also available on All 4.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2023/apr/07/late-night-lycett-joe-lycett-reinvigorates-the-british-chatshow">Continue reading...</a>

Rewatch the footage and even Tom Wyatt, Exeter’s elusive young full-back, could be seen gleefully thumping the turf three times with his right fist last Sunday, in celebration of the thrilling 56th-minute try that helped Exeter <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/apr/02/exeter-montpellier-champions-cup-rugby-union-match-report" title="">secure a home Champions Cup quarter-final</a> against the Stormers this Saturday.</p><p>Or we can retrace our steps and reflect on the improbable Cinderella-style journey that has taken him from there to here. In the hills and narrow lanes of west Somerset they love their sporting pursuits but the road to national prominence can be more isolated and winding than it is in metropolitan areas. The 23‑year‑old Wyatt, a farmer’s son from just outside Wiveliscombe – or “Wivey” as it is known to the locals – has had to go the long way round even to come this far.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/apr/07/tom-wyatt-exeter-stormers-champions-cup-rugby-union">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘A city like a book’: how Lviv’s hippy spirit is surviving Russia’s invasion

<p>The Ukrainian city became a refuge for the long-haired rebels under the Soviets. That tradition remains very much alive, says novelist Andrei Kurkov </p><p>Two dozen cats live and work in the cafe at 1A General Grigorenko Street, in Lviv. They “work” as psychotherapists, bringing relief to customers stressed out by the war. People go there to drink coffee, eat cake and pet the cats. The cafe stays open even when a missile attack has caused power cuts throughout the city. Alik Olisevich sometimes goes along to make sure that the cats themselves are keeping calm.</p><p>Olisevich is Lviv’s best-known – and possibly oldest – hippy, and the keeper of the city’s hippy movement archive. He can most often be found in the Virmenka cafe in the Armenian quarter of the old town, an institution that has been operating since the 1970s central to Lviv’s hippy history. Local students occasionally pop in to see the old-timers – hippies, and writers who seem to have been sitting there since the place opened more than 40 years ago.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/07/lviv-defiant-hippy-spirit-is-defying-the-war-andrei-kurkov-ukraine">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘We get inside their shame, their ego, their destruction’: Jack Thorne brings Burton and Gielgud back to the stage

<p>The Motive and the Cue depicts John Gielgud’s struggle to direct Richard Burton in Hamlet on Broadway. Its writer describes the task of putting his words into such celebrated mouths</p><p>I have spent most of my life avoiding writing about real people. In fact, as a screenwriter, I’ve made half a career out of avoiding it. I wrote pieces that were <em>almost</em> about real people, but not quite. With my Channel 4 dramas <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/20/national-treasure-review-robbie-coltrane" title="">National Treasure</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/10/kiri-review-beautifully-observed-drama-and-not-as-grim-as-expected" title="">Kiri</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/sep/16/help-review-jodie-comer-and-stephen-graham-will-leave-you-breathless-with-rage" title="">Help</a>, out of necessity I wrote towards the truth but didn’t embrace it utterly. With National Treasure I wrote about historic sex crimes and referenced famous sex offenders, but didn’t write <em>of</em> them because to do so was very legally and ethically complicated and might involve upsetting or worsening the damage already done to victims. With Kiri we risked disrupting ongoing legal cases. With Help I wanted to write about care homes during the pandemic without exposing any one of them to unwelcome scrutiny.</p><p>As a dramatist this puts you in a difficult position: how do you make something feel true, but not be true? But it also gives you latitude to find a way into the story from an angle of your choosing. You talk to people, you uncover things, you try to represent stories as best you can.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/apr/07/jack-thorne-richard-burton-john-gielgud-motive-cue">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Seeing friends move on to motherhood without me is made all the more painful by a chronic failure of empathy on both sides</p><p>Standing in a circle of women waiting for an exercise class to start the other day, I found myself laughing and commiserating with them about the bugs their children kept catching at nursery, wondering when I was going to be caught out. I knew the question was coming, “Do you have children?”, followed by the usual uncomfortable silence when I said: “No.”<br /><br />I have always dreamed of being a mother. I am in my late 30s – past the scary age of 35 when a woman’s fertility is meant to fall off a cliff. I’m also single. Every day I struggle to suppress the bubbling panic that I might never have children.</p><p>It has been mentally exhausting and often lonely, hovering between potential motherhood and ending up permanently childless. The experience has been made all the more fraught by what feels like a growing chasm between childless women and mothers.

<p>Pearls, hourglass dresses, pirate boots … the designer died last Christmas but this year her trademark looks are everywhere </p><p>A it turns out, the fashion designer who is defining 2023 bowed out just before the year started. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/dec/30/dame-vivienne-westwood-obituary" title="">Vivienne Westwood</a>, who died on 29 December, was the buzziest name at the shows this season.

Everywhere I look I see Westwood. I don’t mean literally, not ghosts, not Fragonard corsets in Tesco. But the remembering of Westwood has reminded me – reminded all of us – that she isn’t just fashion history. She is fashion.

## Wines for a spring barbecue | Fiona Beckett on drink

<p>Don’t assume you’ll be matching with meat, and look for easy-to-serve, characterful bottles that will be a hit outdoors</p><p>There was a time when you’d only ever write about what to drink with a barbecue in the summer, as if we Brits never had barbecues in any other season. But now that many appliances are more like outdoor ovens, we need to justify the cost by using them year-round, even when it’s chucking it down outside (which, of course, is perfectly likely on a bank holiday weekend).</p><p>It also calls for a bit of a rethink about what kind of wine to serve with them. Barbecue no longer necessarily means burgers, wings and sweet-sticky ribs. Anything that’s cooked over coals now qualifies. Think fresh sardines on a beach picnic. Or some smoky aubergines as part of a Middle Eastern feast. Or spicy, yoghurt-marinated kebabs and a couple of salads. And they’re all as likely to prompt a white, rosé or orange wine as a red one.</p><p>For more by Fiona Beckett, go to <a href="https://fionabeckett.substack.com/">fionabeckett.substack.com</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/apr/07/wines-for-a-spring-barbecue-fiona-beckett">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When schools fail to explain the Troubles, division and sectarianism spread. Our history must be on the curriculum</p><p>In 1998, there were children as young as 11 reading the full text of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1998/apr/12/immigrationpolicy">Good Friday agreement</a> in class, such was the unbridled excitement about the opportunity it represented to shape a better future. One might have expected that the globally revered peace agreement responsible for ending Northern Ireland’s 30-year conflict would become a permanent fixture in the curriculum, especially given the living document’s direct and tangible impact on the lives of young people today. At only <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1034123/The_Belfast_Agreement_An_Agreement_Reached_at_the_Multi-Party_Talks_on_Northern_Ireland.pdf">36 pages</a>, it is tantalisingly accessible – although “not like a novel”, as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/06/dominic-raab-government-brexit-foreign-office">Dominic Raab</a> pointed out, when the Northern Ireland affairs committee <a href="https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/brexit/raab-says-good-friday-agreement-not-like-cracking-novel-but-he-used-it-as-reference-tool-during-brexit-talks/37764912.html">asked</a> if he had read it in its entirety. However, despite its inverse proportionality of brevity and significance, the Good Friday agreement forms no part of the core programme of study in schools in today’s Northern Ireland, and nor do the decades of conflict that preceded it.</p><p>In Northern Ireland, the generations born after the historic agreement made on 10 April 1998 are known as “peace babies”, and expected to be the baton-bearers of a true and lasting accord. But, rather than guide and teach them about the impact of the Troubles and the Good Friday agreement, our largely segregated education system delivers them into a hostile political wilderness that seems designed to harden their ignorance into apathy at best, or hostility at worst.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/07/good-friday-agreement-northern-ireland-young-people-schools-troubles-sectarianism">Continue reading...</a>

This isn’t exactly straightforward, as Cyril has five children with four mothers who, until now, have never met, on account of “Cyril [seeing] himself as more of a people person than a father. Sadly, for his children, this sociability didn’t extend to the five of them in a way that was mutually beneficial.”</p><p>Nonetheless, by the end of their day out, Cyril has accomplished his aim: for the siblings, who are aged between nine and 19, to know one another in order that they don’t “fall in love or have sex or any of dem tings”. Before saying goodbye, the eldest, Nikisha, tells the younger ones: “If anything happens, you call me, OK?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/07/people-person-by-candice-carty-williams-audiobook-review-sibling-bonds-and-absent-fathers">Continue reading...</a>

Always the toughest, smartest fighter in her class, she risks everything to go after him.

## What was that dreadful thud? The sound of Keir Starmer falling off his high horse | Marina Hyde

<p>‘Civility in politics’? Starmer may have to stable that faithful nag after Labour’s awful ‘paedo protector’ attack ad on Rishi Sunak</p><p>Encouraging news for anyone who fears the next election might be some fight for the moral high ground, as Labour releases <a href="https://twitter.com/UKLabour/status/1643973886311297028">a new attack ad</a>. Have you seen this one? If not, do try to catch it before they take it down and tacitly blame someone nameless. It depicts a smiling Rishi Sunak next to the inquiry: “Do you think adults convicted of sexually assaulting children should go to prison? Rishi Sunak doesn’t.” Oh dear. In case that grim message was too opaque for you, Sunak’s famous signature is added, above the explainer: “Under the Tories, 4,500 adults convicted of assaulting children under 16 served no prison time. Labour will lock up dangerous child abusers.”</p><p>Righto. Attempts to cast this ad as a “dog whistle” seem misplaced, affording its stunning crassness a kind of subtlety that it simply can’t carry off. I think that when everyone can hear the dog whistle, it’s just a whistle? If you can’t discern the shrill sound of something telling you Rishi Sunak doesn’t want nonces to go to prison, do consider booking a hearing test at your very earliest convenience.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/07/keir-starmer-high-horse-politics-labour-rishi-sunak">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Marylebone theatre, London<br /></strong>The capacity to arrest our own destruction is central in Eugene O’Hare’s stark look at a woman struggling to cope after the death of her teenage daughter</p><p>As The Dry House begins, a woman is asleep on the sofa in a cluttered living room. Her dressing gown, like the wall behind her, is a pale, defeated pink. This is Chrissy (Mairead McKinley), who started hitting the booze long ago. Rock bottom quickly followed. It was at the funeral of her teenage daughter, Heather (Carla Langley), that she realised she could start drinking properly at last and no one would possibly blame her.</p><p>The capacity to arrest our own destruction is central here. “We’re all destroyed the same, so we are,” reflects Chrissy. Claire (Kathy Kiera Clarke) has her own fraught relationship with alcohol, though she is focused mainly on preparing her sister for a spell in a “dry house.” Empties strewn around her like the remnants of a shooting range, Chrissy asks: “Can we talk about it when I get to the end of this can?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/apr/07/the-dry-house-review-marylebone-theatre-london">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Are you sitting comfortably? Well, get up! Stay healthy and supple by adding these basic movements to your daily routine</p><p>Things have changed a lot since the days when humans chased animals for food and had to walk long distances for water. But our bodies haven’t: we are still built to move in all the ways our ancestors needed to. Add in today’s personal transport, mechanical conveniences and screens that glue us to our chairs, and what do you get? Achy hips and backs, stiff necks, sore knees, and a significant downgrading of many markers of good health.</p><p>Generally, it is better to think about pain and discomfort in the body not as tissue damage or trauma but as a request for change. We have spent two decades coaching everyone from athletes to ordinary people who just want to feel better. We’ve found that motion can counteract the effects of modern living, enhance your capacity for easy movement and improve all the body’s systems (digestive, circulatory, immune, lymphatic). The following moves are basic body maintenance, and suitable for everyone. They are the key to being able to do all the things you love well into old age.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/07/life-changing-daily-moves-that-will-keep-your-body-happy">Continue reading...</a>

It quoted from a book by Brown, a professor who specializes on topics of intimacy, to define vulnerability as “the willingness to show up and be seen when we have no control over the outcome”. Being vulnerable could mean “we are able to form deeper, more meaningful bonds with those around us”, the chat bot wrote.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/07/chatgpt-artificial-intelligence-religion-faith-leaders">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Late Argentina great’s personal trainer recounts in this book extract a visit he made to the player’s room before Mexico 86</p><p>Diego Maradona arrived in Mexico like a well-tuned violin. He had managed to stabilise his weight at 76kg long before the World Cup. His physical condition was optimal from the feet to the neck, and little by little he managed to acclimatise to the Aztec high habitat. The place chosen as the training camp was ideal for footballers – although they baptised it as ‘Alcatraz’, the famous American penitentiary located on a small island in the San Francisco Bay. They could perform the necessary exercises to adapt to the altitude, enjoy many hours of rest and sleep, a good diet and a relaxed, calm atmosphere.</p><p>The coach Carlos Bilardo, who had rehearsed acclimatisation to the altitude with a group of players – although without Diego – in Tilcara, a town in the province of Jujuy located about 3,000m above sea level, also organised several training sessions at the time set for games, so the boys would also get used to the torrid heat of the Mexican summer. Diego trained with the team on the field, where Bilardo ordered his tactics and strategies.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/07/diego-maradona-win-world-cup-on-his-own-mexico-86">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Superpang Records)<br /></strong>Norwegian trumpeter Arve Henriksen finally meets his match with Alex Roth’s superb band, who push the limitations of their instruments and shift between many registers</p><p>Arve Henriksen has made his name by being a trumpeter who doesn’t really sound like a trumpeter. On his albums for ECM and Rune Grammofon, on collaborations with the likes of David Sylvian and Iain Ballamy, or when playing as part of the band Supersilent, he can sound as if he’s playing a shakuhachi flute, a whistle or a conch shell. He creates haunting timbres by attaching a saxophone mouthpiece to his trumpet, or not using a mouthpiece at all; he makes odd harmonics by using half-valve techniques or exploiting deliberate “leaks” in the trumpet.</p><p>On this project the Norwegian finally meets a band who can match him. The MultiTraction Orchestra were formed in 2020, when the Detroit-born, London-raised, Kraków-based guitarist Alex Roth assembled 27 musicians from all over the world for an epic track entitled <a href="https://alexrothmusic.bandcamp.com/track/emerge-entangled">Emerge Entangled</a>, recorded remotely under lockdown. This belated follow-up revisits the free spirit of that 2020 session, but with a much smaller and more focused cast. Like Henriksen, all six of his bandmates use extended techniques to push the limitations of their instruments and shift between many registers: from the medieval minimalism of Part IV (where Kate Ellis’s creaking, multitracked cello sounds like a hurdy gurdy) to the distorted, rhythmically unsettling post-rock of Part II (where saxophonist James Allsopp freaks out over Ruth Goller’s rumbling bass lines).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/07/multitraction-orchestra-reactor-one-review-spectral-alien-improv">Continue reading...</a>

Rather than distract or soothe, the veteran laptop composer’s latest reflects our jaundiced reality – full of aural pollution, oil splatter and other nasty stuff. Like the most wholesome ambient works, No Highs is immersive and oceanic. Unlike them, it is not somewhere you would want to bathe.</p><p>The record opens with a warning – an arrhythmic pulse bent by tremors and ill-omened sirens. But the promised threat never arrives, just lurks like something repressed. On his last few records, Hecker used piano or ancient woodwind to sweeten and lift his drone washes. No Highs is darker, dingier, yet oddly inviting. On songs called Monotony and Monotony II – yes, he has jokes – his fuzzy morse code tones become a strange source of comfort, like an alarm integrated into a dream.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/07/tim-hecker-no-highs-review">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘They have inspired composers for centuries’: a first for the seven last words of Christ

<p>Five centuries after the Passion was first set to music, Jesus’s final words are to be sung in Welsh for the first time.  From Haydn to MacMillan and Muhly, composer Alexander Mills assesses a rich musical  heritage – and how his own fits in</p><p>I felt hugely honoured when I was asked to compose a new setting of Christ’s Seven Last Words for Easter this year. I also felt the weight of 500 years of tradition on my shoulders. <br /><br />The canon of works that transport us to the foot of the cross to witness Jesus’s final words includes delicate Renaissance polyphony, grand oratorios, masterful contemporary works, and even musical theatre (thanks, Andrew Lloyd Webber). What could another new version possibly bring to the table?<br /><br />Welsh, for a start. When it’s premiered on Good Friday at Saint Deiniol’s Cathedral in Bangor, my composition Saith Air y Groes will be the first ever Seven Last Words to be sung in Welsh.</p><p>For those of you trying to remember what Christ’s Seven Last Words were, they’re not actually individual words at all. They’re seven distinct statements, beginning with the familiar, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do”, before cycling through different emotional states, such as “I thirst” and “It is finished”, and ending with the epic, “Father, into your hands I commend my spirit.”<br /><br />How do we know he said all this? We don’t. The Seven Last Words are a harmonisation that unites quotes from the different accounts of the crucifixion in the four gospels to create a single narrative in the shape of these seven sentences. Together, the words provide the complete spiritual architecture of Christian existence. No wonder they have inspired composers for centuries. <br /><br />The tradition of setting them to music evolved out of medieval Passion settings. An extraordinary early example is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4JK1rhgtq4eg1IDSoMqSCa?si=R-GvEorDTxWazt-PbRWU5g">Maria Plena Virtute</a>, written circa 1510, by Robert Fayrfax, one of Tudor England’s most significant composers. The Latin text contains six of the seven last words (and paraphrases the seventh) in an intimate meditation on the Passion story that moves between narrative and personal contemplation. <br /><br />Meanwhile, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2raKAYAQTMIGju73TxAvgu?si=mBjquJq3S6i2Zj84XUoZLQ">Heinrich Schütz’s setting</a> from 1645, widely considered to be the first complete musical setting of the Seven Last Words, creates immediacy through characterisation. We have moved from Renaissance polyphony to baroque oratorio. Jesus is sung by a solo tenor. A choral prelude and postlude offer commentary; narrative is delivered in recitative-like passages. For me, something of the text’s secret power is lost in this formalised dramatic structure, but the laser-sharp clarity of how Schütz sets the German vernacular text, (compiled from the Luther Bible) is an inspiration. <br /><br />When it came to setting the Welsh, I used a simple, unadorned approach, similar to plainchant – the unaccompanied early Christian musical tradition of chanting the liturgy in unison, which is also a feature of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1JL45GYpZvXMlG7kJgjxqt?si=MOr90i1ZS1qbb797lDq6IQ&amp;nd=1">James MacMillan’s mesmerising setting from 1994</a>. My aim was for a clear and direct, yet solemn, presentation of the powerful text, which is taken from the first complete translation of the Bible into Welsh by William Morgan, published in 1588.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/07/seven-last-words-of-christ-welsh-bangor-cathedral-alex-mills">Continue reading...</a>

We both cried for weeks. Sometimes I screamed in pain. The guilt I felt for using formula – despite my hungry pre-term baby’s need for it – was matched only by the fury I felt at the professionals who treat exclusive breastfeeding as worth the sacrifice of a mother’s mental health.</p><p>My mind boggles at some of the advice I was given: how I was instructed to pump after every feed, but no one thought to tell me that I needn’t continue this indefinitely, compounding my distress and exhaustion; the lactation-promoting drug – which I did not take because one of the side-effects was depression – I was prescribed despite my milk coming in as normal on day three; the NCT breastfeeding “expert” who said that the pain was because we were doing it wrong; my tiny baby who had not been in the womb long enough to fully develop his feeding reflex, with his tied tongue and his minuscule mouth opening and closing like a baby bird’s as he struggled to latch, and I, his mother, bruised and bleeding. I finally had to steel myself to firmly tell the health visitor that exclusive breastfeeding was no longer realistic or desirable for either of us.</p><p>Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist and author</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/07/stopping-breastfeeding-baby-mixed-feeding">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It’s time to modernise shareholder relations and make AGMs interesting again</p><p>An unruly annual shareholder meeting is a fine thing. Small investors, who rarely have a voice during the rest of the year, get a chance to look the directors in the eye and deliver an unfiltered blast from the outside world.</p><p>The board of Barclays, during one of the bank’s many mega-bonus disgraces, endured <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/24/barclays-agm-protests-shareholders-pay-bonuses">two hours of fury</a> at a packed Royal Festival Hall in 2014 in a classic of the genre.

<p>Got something you’d like to ask the flugelhorn-tooting forensic scientist and all-round star of stage and screen? Send it our way and we’ll put it to her</p><p>You might think of her as forensic scientist Eve Lockhart from BBC series Waking the Dead, or as Queen Selyse Baratheon in Game of Thrones, but Tara Fitzgerald is a long-termer when it comes to film. Her first big role was in Peter Chelsom’s 1991 nightclub comedy Hear My Song, after which she went on to a couple of roles opposite Hugh Grant: Sirens in 1994 and The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain in 1995. In between the two she was in A Man of No Importance with Albert Finney. Then came the flugelhorn-tooting Brassed Off, and the Czech war film Dark Blue World. More recently she played Miriam in Ridley Scott’s biblical epic Exodus: Gods and Kings. There’s been theatre, too: opposite Peter O’Toole in Our Song, as Ophelia opposite Ralph Fiennes’ Hamlet, and as Lady Macbeth in 2016.</p><p>Now she stars in new British coming-of-age drama Kindling, which follows a group of young men who return to their home town to turn their terminally ill friend’s final summer into a celebration of life, love and friendship. So what would you like to ask her? What does she remember of her great-aunt (and celebrated actor herself) Geraldine Fitzgerald? Does she regret never moving to Hollywood? Can she still play the flugelhorn? Post your questions below by 6pm on Easter Monday 10 April, and we’ll ask.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/07/post-your-questions-for-tara-fitzgerald">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The generation born after the Good Friday agreement, which brought peace to Northern Ireland, are continuing to reckon with their inheritance. Mother and daughter Anne and Kerrie Patterson explain what it means to them</p><p>On 10 April 1998, <strong>Kerrie Patterson</strong> was born in a hospital in Northern Ireland. Her arrival came just minutes after the historic Good Friday agreement was signed in Belfast. The agreement paved the way for peace after decades of conflict between nationalists and unionists, and provided a structure for them to share power in a revived national assembly. Patterson tells <strong>Michael Safi </strong>about her unique status as a “peace baby” and how her generation has inherited a society that can move beyond the old divisions of Catholic v Protestant and nationalist v unionist.</p><p>Peace did not come overnight and sectarian violence still haunts Northern Ireland, but the change from the 30-year Troubles is marked. For <strong>Anne Patterson, </strong>Kerrie’s mother, peace is a process, not an event. She describes her own childhood, which was marked by proximity to violence, and how it made her determined to give her daughter a life free from the old divisions.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/audio/2023/apr/07/peace-babies-and-the-birth-of-the-good-friday-agreement-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
