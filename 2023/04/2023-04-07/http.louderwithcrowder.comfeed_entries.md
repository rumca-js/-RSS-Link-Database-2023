I mean, the guy <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chris-pratt-swoon-he-only-eats-what-he-kills/" target="_blank">only eats what he kills</a>, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chris-pratt-memorial-day-instagram" target="_blank">loves the military</a>, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chris-pratt-pledge-allegiance/" target="_blank">loves his country</a>, and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chris-pratt-nine-rules-mtv" target="_blank">loves his fans</a> more than most everyone else in Hollywood combined. When Chris Pratt walks by... well... I just get very comfortable.</p><p>Then came how he celebrated Easter. These photos were posted to his Instagram account in 2016, but I figure the world could use a reminder.</p><p>First, pick the spot:</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="instagram-media"><div style="padding: 16px;"> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BDejFxajHD5/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" style="line-height: 0;

He did it all quietly. He didn't have his publicist put out a statement that he was doing this. He didn't leak it to TMZ that this was happening. He just put up a giant cross with his buddies and shared the photos with his fans on Instagram, to remind everyone of the true meaning of Easter. Also, I'm still confused about the egg and the bunny thing. I get the egg (birth, newness, freshness) but the bunny is still a question mark. I'll just chalk it up to some Satanic fertility ritual. Tell everybody.<br /></p><p> It's Prattness with spring petals. Come on.</p><p>Chris Pratt can do no wrong with us. But if next year he could release a video in which he theorizes about the Easter Bunny and how it relates to Jesus dying on the cross for the forgiveness of sins, it would be much appreciated. On second thought, just nail an Easter bunny to the cross. Synergy.</p><p>So, while we hear stories about actors cheating on their wives, or <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dear-leonardo-dicaprio-self-righteous-hypocritical-energy-guzzling-jackass/">when Leo DiCaprio sees fit to lecture the rest of us about global warming, whilst living in one of his six mansions,</a> we still have some in Hollywood who show us not all is lost for Tinseltown. There is some sanity and some faith left in that place. What does it look like? It looks like Chris Pratt, y'all.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

She was forced to barricade herself inside a room at the San Francisco State University until it was safe for her to come out.

She was a collegiate swimmer who competed against transgender Lia Thomas during the controversial NCAA finals in March 2022. Riley and the other competitors, according to science, were all women. Lia, according to the AP Styleguide, was also a woman. Albeit, a woman who was born male, went through puberty as a male, <a href="https://meaww.com/lia-thomas-women-uncomfortable-changing-in-locker-room-with-trans-u-penn-swimmer" target="_blank">still has male genitalia, and still dates women</a> just like those who were born male and went through puberty as males with male genitalia have been traditionally known to do. </p><p>There are critics who believe transgender athletes like Lia being born a male gives them unfair genetic advantages over the biologically female collegiate swimmers. Even though, as the AP Styleguide says, Lia is a woman.</p><p>Raines is one of those critics and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lia-thomas-riley-gaines-tied" target="_blank">experienced the political agenda of the left</a> when it comes to <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lia-thomas-riley-gaines" target="_blank">men pretending to be women in sports</a> firsthand. She has been speaking out on behalf of women ever since. This stands in contrast to the White House, which has ranked men who claim to be women over women on a whole host of issues.</p><p>You may have noticed the "***" at the top. That's a note to any "independent" "fact" checkers who may stumble across this. No, the White House did not say "go attack Riley Gaines" verbatim. They only said how proud they are of trans kids fighting back. It's a mere coinkydink that trans kids violently fought back later that day.  I can only imagine these same  "independent" "fact" checkers would differentiate between the two had it been Trump encouraging people to fight back.</p><p>Wait a tick. I don't have to imagine. Because Donald Trump did recently encourage his supporters to protest at his arraignment. And HE was accused of encouraging violence by the same media who will sweep this under the rug. Or blame the victim (Riley) as they have been doing.</p><p>There was no violence among Trump supporters. There was among trans activists. A woman attempted to speak her mind. A man in a dress went to beat the crap out of her for it surrounded by other angry, violent activists.</p><p>I wonder if the White House is proud of them too?</p><p><br /></p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

If they REALLY don't want you to notice, they drop a story on the last day before a holiday weekend. Joe Biden's White House did that yesterday when they dropped the post-mortem on Biden's disastrous and deadly Afghanistan withdrawal. Doocy was less than amused.</p><p>John Kirby handled the briefing. As is customary, the WH gets a man to do the job when they don't think Karine Jean-Pierre is up to the task. Kirby told Doocy no one is getting fired because accountability is not what this White House is about.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">DOOCY: "Who's going to get fired over this?!"<br /><br />KIRBY: "The purpose of it is not accountability." <a href="https://t.co/uPl6O9LrVN">pic.twitter.com/uPl6O9LrVN</a><br />— Townhall.com (@townhallcom) <a href="https://twitter.com/townhallcom/status/1644039782668857361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 6, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Kirby even said the White House was proud of the withdrawal that saw children being killed and people hanging off of planes. Also, a terrorist attack that saw thirteen servicemembers killed.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">DOOCY: "There were children being killed...there were people hanging off of Air Force jets that were leaving. And you're saying you guys are PROUD of the way that this mission was conducted?"<br /><br />KIRBY: "You bet." <a href="https://t.co/3tZETaMKdA">pic.twitter.com/3tZETaMKdA</a><br />— Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) <a href="https://twitter.com/DailyCaller/status/1644041632809906181?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 6, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Let's take a quick back in time to the summer of 2021, and just HOW much of a disaster Biden's Afghanistan withdrawal was. Because if you believe the media this week, the worst thing a president has ever done is fill out the wrong paperwork to allegedly bribe the porn star he banged while his third wife was pregnant.</p><p>Biden's withdrawal from Afghanistan was so bad, it <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/biden-afghanistan-matt-zeller-msnbc" target="_blank">was panned by veterans across the ideological spectrum</a>. The White House found themselves <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/doocy-hammers-psaki-on-admin-leaving-americans-in-afghanistan-is-there-a-better-word-for-stranded" target="_blank">arguing over the definition of the word "stranded"</a> to describe the fate of the Americans they left behind. And the terror attack that killed thirteen service members in Kabul? <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/vargas-andrews-testimony-breaks-down" target="_blank">The one that could have been prevented?</a> The gold star parents who lost their sons and daughter that day have blamed Biden's incompetence <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-marine-mother-unloads" target="_blank">over</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-gold-star-mother" target="_blank">over</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-gold-star-parent" target="_blank">over</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/gold-star-mother-biden" target="_blank">over</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/gold-star-father-biden-leno" target="_blank">over</a> again.</p><p>The White House is holding NO ONE accountable for it. And they would prefer you not even noticing their report where they don't hold anyone accountable. Happy Easter.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Watch: Tim Pool compares Dylan Mulvaney to Elsa eating feces and he makes a good point

<img src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=33429650&amp;width=1200&amp;height=800&amp;coordinates=200%2C0%2C0%2C0" /><br /><br /><p>Dylan Mulvaney, known for performing in titface and being Joe Biden's favorite TikToker, has become quite the lightning rod for controversy. Though Tim Pool views Dylan as nothing more than a walking algorithm. The living embodiment of Elsa eating feces before going on a crime spree with Spider-Man.</p><p>You know, it's best to just let Tim explain.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rumble">

</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsagate" target="_blank">ElsaGate took place in 2016</a>. Computers were used to game YouTube's algorithm and target your children, by having children's characters do not-appropriate for children things. So that if you let your kid watch an Elsa video on YouTube while you went in the kitchen to make them lunch, the kid would start clicking around when they see the other videoes YouTube was recommending. Eventually, Elsa singing "Let It Go" would lead to a video of an adult dressed like Elsa and eating feces. Or other childhood characters doing worse.</p><p>Pool says Dylan is a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dylan-mulvaney-bud-light" target="_blank">grifter who learned how to game to algorithm</a>. Namely, since the algorithms favor progressive politics and woke virtue signaling,  that's what he's providing.</p><blockquote>Dylan Mulvaney prancing around the woods wearing high heels is not something a trans individual does or a woman does. It is a caricature, and it is a real-life version of "Elsagate." The algorithm mashed these things together, and Dylan Mulvaney said if I do this, I will get clicks. To any sane adult, seeing an adult human male taking hormones and getting surgery, putting on high heels, and running through the woods, you'd be like "hold on, this is really weird." But all of these different things combined make the algorithm promote it. This individual gets views and then promotes more of it.<br /></blockquote><p>Just look at Dylan on Day 7665ish of being a boy.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">NEW: Footage has surfaced of Dylan Mulvaney—pre-transition—on ‘The Price Is Right’ <a href="https://t.co/svxv0HMQMo">pic.twitter.com/svxv0HMQMo</a><br />— Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) <a href="https://twitter.com/DailyCaller/status/1636464466228289539?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 16, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>As I've said, and I know I'm not the only one, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dylan-mulvaney-ulta-biden" target="_self">pre-White House visit</a> I legit thought Dylan Mulvaney was a parody. If I were a guy who wanted to pretend to be trans for social media clout, I'd talk about how awesome it is to shop and wear makeup and how that defines me as a "girl." Dylan acts like how people who don't like women act when they impersonate vapid basic bitches.</p><p>Instead of being a parody, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tampons-confused" target="_blank">he is now inspiring copycats</a> who see how easy it is.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Biological male who went viral this year for attempting to join a sorority is now learning from Dylan Mulvaney and creating tiktoks making a mockery of women. <a href="https://t.co/CFUCgzg5Xb">pic.twitter.com/CFUCgzg5Xb</a><br />— Libs of TikTok (@libsoftiktok) <a href="https://twitter.com/libsoftiktok/status/1597799390613499904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>I'll be honest. If this is just a giant grift? I say game respect game. It's not Dylan's fault that brands and the President of the United States favor men who pretend to be women more than they do women. Dylan didn't invent the rainy day. He's just got the biggest umbrella. And a desperate need to be famous.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
