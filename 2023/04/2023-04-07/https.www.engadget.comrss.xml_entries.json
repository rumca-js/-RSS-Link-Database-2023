This beast is big and expensive, but it also makes some damn good pizza.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><h2>Design</h2><figure><img alt=\"Ooni Volt 12 review\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/8f0d4500-d568-11ed-a5bc-14a346119dc1\" style=\"height: 1333px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>The Volt 12 looks like what I\u2019d expect an electric pizza oven from Ooni to look like. It bears the most resemblance to the Karu 16, one of the largest models the company offers. The gray and black color scheme is on every current Ooni model, except for the all-silver multi-fuel Karu 12. Rather than a rectangle, the Volt 12 has angled corners, making it more of a flat octagon than a boring box. Ooni says the exterior is powder-coated and weather resistant so you can take it outdoors \u2013 not that you would want it to get too wet. Since this model is more of a countertop appliance than its open-flame predecessors, the Volt 12 has short, stubby legs rather than the longer, folding ones on the wood- and gas- burning units.</p><p>Only three Ooni models have glass doors that allow you to watch the entire cooking process. As an electric, indoor oven, the Volt 12 is one of those. Unlike the Karu 16 and Karu 12G, this panel is gloss black instead of metal. The door has a robust black handle that remains cool to the touch, even at 850 degrees, and a row of three control dials sit beneath the glass window. The only other button is an on/off switch on the left side of the front. This turns off the power completely. When this is switched on, the oven sits in standby mode until you hit the power button on the front that actually gets the Volt 12 ready to use.</p><p>On the left is the time dial with the power button above it. The center control is for temperature, which ranges from 350 to 850 degrees Fahrenheit. Lastly, the far right dial is for \u201cbalance,\u201d allowing you to shift how much power is given to the top and bottom heating elements. In other words, you can put more emphasis on the stone for a crisper crust or more on the top for a bit more browning/char. The balance control also activates a boost feature that can be used to get the stone to return to target temp quickly between pizzas (it takes about 45 seconds). All three controls are flanked by white lights for precise level indications. During pre-heating, for example, the temperature dial starts at 350 and slowly moves around to your target, blinking along the way at the current status.</p><p>The bottom heating element sits underneath the stone \u2013 a 13-inch square cooking surface that can accommodate a variety of pans in addition to 12-inch pizza. There\u2019s also an interior light that stays on the whole time, making it very easy to see how things are progressing without having to open the door.</p><h2>Setup and use</h2><figure><img alt=\"Ooni Volt 12 review\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/b08848b0-d568-11ed-bffe-351b2850b840\" style=\"height: 1333px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Before the first use, you\u2019ll need to season Volt 12. This requires you to run the oven at full blast (850) for 20 minutes and then allow it to cool before preheating to launch your first pizza. The cooldown takes quite a bit longer than the preheating or 20-minute burnoff, so you\u2019ll want to do thing well before you need to actually cook. The cool down time on the Volt 12 takes a while. While the exterior will be back to room temp sooner, it takes a while for the inside to do the same since the Volt 12 is so well-insulated. This means you\u2019ll have to wait at least an hour to safely store it or put the cover on.</p><p>Ooni says the 1,600-watt Volt 12 can hit 850 degrees in 20 minutes where it can cook a pizza in 90 seconds. This makes it slightly slower to achieve max temperature than its wood- or gas-burning counterparts. The Karu 16, for example, can reach 950 degrees Fahrenheit in 15 minutes. Still, 20 minutes is remarkably quick, and in my experience, the Volt 12 actually hit 850 faster than that.</p><p>The key advantage the Volt 12 has over its wood-burning siblings is convenience. Those models make great pizza with the subtle flavor of wood fire, but the flames require supervision whereas the Volt 12 is very much set it and forget it. You don\u2019t have to worry about maintaining the fire in between stretching dough, topping pizzas and launching them into the oven. The Volt 12 also sets the balance dial based on your cooking temperature, but you can adjust it if you need to. Most outdoor Ooni ovens have an optional gas burner (propane and natural gas models), which would also remedy some of the headaches with temperature regulation.</p><h2>Making the pizza</h2><figure><img alt=\"Ooni Volt 12 review\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/cb372fa0-d568-11ed-9f62-6d3f4615f865\" style=\"height: 1333px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>All of this sounds great on paper, but it would be for naught if the thing didn\u2019t make good pizza. Thankfully, Ooni has translated its formula for excellent outdoor cooking to its electric oven. The Volt 12 produces comparable results to any of the company\u2019s other models, right down to the char and leoparding on Neapolitan pies. Since the temperature dial gives you more precise control, it\u2019s easier to achieve the desired cook on everything from New York style to thin-and-crispy. With the extra space inside, you can also make Detroit pan pizza, as well as roast and bake other items with ease. The Volt 12 did well with any type of crust I threw at it, churning out tasty pies consistently in just a few minutes.</p><p>Running wide open at 850 degrees, the Volt 12 makes excellent Neapolitan-style pizza. You\u2019ll need to make sure you have a proper dough recipe (Scott Deley\u2019s <em>The Ooni Pizza Project </em>is a great guide), but assuming you're starting with a good base, the oven will do its thing well. I found that the Volt 12 is a little more forgiving with rotating the pies than the open-flame outdoor models, so you don\u2019t need to babysit it quite as much. These pizzas were light and airy with a slight crispness to the bottom and the requisite leoparding. New York-style pizzas baked at 650 were also great, with crisp edges and bottom, with a pleasant chewiness to the crust.</p><figure><img alt=\"Ooni Volt 12 review\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/e6368080-d568-11ed-bfdf-85fc1e3b22ff\" style=\"height: 1333px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>There are some downsides to the Volt 12, the big one being the price. It\u2019s $999, and I\u2019ll be the first to tell you that excellent pizza is achievable with your main oven and a baking stone or steel that costs a fraction as much. The second thing is it\u2019s huge. The Volt 12 takes up the entire depth of the counter and is 20 inches wide. It also weighs just under 40 pounds. That\u2019s not too heavy, relatively speaking, and the Volt 12 can easily be chucked in the backseat for a nearby party. Ooni did design it with built-in handles on the sides though, which makes the task of moving it slightly easier.</p><h2>The competition</h2><p>In the US, Ooni\u2019s main competition for the Volt 12 is the Breville Pizzaiolo. This oven has been on the market for a few years at this point, with a design that looks more like one of the company\u2019s toaster ovens. It\u2019s an all-stainless steel aesthetic, with a glass door for viewing and easy-to-use controls up front. Out of the box, the Pizzaiolo runs on a variety of presets for different styles, but Breville also equipped it with a manual mode to give you full control over the top and bottom heating elements.</p><p>The three strikes against this alternative are cost, a confining cooking surface and the lack of interior lighting. The Pizzaiolo is $999.95, so unless you find one on sale, you won\u2019t save any money over the Volt 12. The stone on the Pizzaiolo is circular instead of square, so you\u2019ll only be able to use 12-inch round pans in addition to your pizza. And lastly, there\u2019s no light inside, so it can be a challenge to keep tabs on the cooking process. You\u2019ll almost certainly have to open the door at some point for a closer inspection.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>With the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=0de15002-ec35-49d8-b24c-3d060213cd2b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Ooni+Pizza+Ovens&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIwZGUxNTAwMi1lYzM1LTQ5ZDgtYjI0Yy0zZDA2MDIxM2NkMmIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9vb25pLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0cy9vb25pLXZvbHQiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjM0ODExZWU1LTA4ZmItNDg3Yy1iOGQ5LTEyYzQwMzZkNGNkZCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAcxhsVPxK8Lq14OIoiiFKLfcxjD0RkBc_RTmI8VmxbgH&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fooni.com%2Fproducts%2Fooni-volt\">Volt 12</a>, Ooni enters new territory by bringing its formula for stone-baked pizza indoors. While the results are consistently great across a range of styles, this is the company\u2019s most expensive product to date, and I can see that being prohibitive for some \u2013 no matter how good the pizza is. A Karu 16 with the additional purchase of a gas burner is $920 or $950 (propane vs. natural gas), which would give you the convenience of a control dial with option of cooking with wood. Still not cheap, but that oven is big enough to do more than just pizza, so it\u2019s also quite versatile. What it really comes down to is where you\u2019ll be cooking most often \u2013 inside or out \u2013 or if you\u2019re just fine upgrading your pizza game with accessories for your kitchen oven. And there\u2019s absolutely no shame in doing that.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ooni-volt-12-review-180019262.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/ooni-volt-12-review-180019262.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-07 18:00:19+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Nest Secure and Dropcam products will stop working in April 2024", "description": "<p>Google <a href=\"https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Blog/An-update-for-our-Nest-Secure-Dropcam-and-Works-with-Nest-Users-and/ba-p/391449\">announced</a> end-of-life dates today for products relying on the Nest app that won\u2019t carry over to the new Google Home.

This is a significant improvement to existing technologies, as current measurements are conducted within areas of 100 square miles. TEMPO should be able to take accurate measurements from neighborhood to neighborhood, giving a comprehensive view of pollution from both the macro and micro levels.</p><p>This also gives us some unique opportunities to pick up new kinds of data, such as changing pollution levels throughout rush hour, the effects of lightning on the ozone layer, the movement of pollution related to forest fires and the long-term effects of fertilizers on the atmosphere, among other data points. More information is never bad.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt=\"NASA TEMPO, GEMS and Sentinel-4 satellites.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/67fa9170-d55e-11ed-bdbf-8dd71208083e\" style=\"height: 554px; width: 985px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">NASA</div></figure><p>TEMPO is the middle child in a group of high-powered instruments tracking pollution.

Other tracking satellites will eventually join TEMPO up there in the great black, including the forthcoming <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nasa-india-nisar-radar-satellite-215200448.html\">NASA instrument to measure the planet's crust.  </a></p><p>You may notice that TEMPO flew into space on a SpaceX rocket and not a NASA rocket.

Just note that you may have to invest in a separate stand to keep your laptop at a more comfortable eye level.&nbsp;</p><h2>Apple Watch SE</h2><p></p><p>The <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMEJESjFNVkJWP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXJ5LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzNjEwMGM4Yy1kYTJkLTQ1N2QtYjBmMS03MjJmNGI5ODYxOWUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAefDlef3KgKiZxsubUWWYqjjYZn21jQSiApX4Od6be3R&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BDJ1MVBV\">Apple Watch SE</a> has dropped to $219, which is within $10 of the lowest price we've seen. This isn't the first time we've seen the smartwatch hit this price, but it's still $30 below Apple's MSRP. We gave the latest SE a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-se-2022-review-battery-life-workout-health-tracking-144551799.html\">review score of 89</a> last September, and we currently recommend it for first-time and budget-conscious wearable buyers in our guide to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-smartwatches-153013118.html\">the best smartwatches</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Compared to the pricier Apple Watch Series 8, the top pick in our guide, the SE lacks an always-on display mode, fast charging and premium features like a skin temperature sensor, ECG monitor and blood oxygen sensor. Its display is a smidge smaller, too. That said, it still provides most of the core Apple Watch feature set for way less money, with support for notifications, heart-rate monitoring and crash detection. It also uses the same processor as the Series 8, so it doesn't feel slow in everyday use.&nbsp;</p><h2>Samsung 980 Pro SSD with Heatsink</h2><p></p><p>The 1TB model of <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOUpITDMzWDc_dGg9MSZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1yeS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzYxMDBjOGMtZGEyZC00NTdkLWIwZjEtNzIyZjRiOTg2MTllIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAZBielMoOqHDUPdMjFs-dyYrf_b_naKIL-7eW662_cfG&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB09JHL33X7%3Fth%3D1\">Samsung's 980 Pro</a> SSD with an integrated heatsink is on sale for $87, which is a new all-time low.

The Yeti Nano is a compact USB microphone <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/blue-yeti-nano-microphone-irl-143058272.html\">we've recommended</a> in the past. There are certainly <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/advanced-podcast-buyers-guide-part-1-143053492.html\">clearer-sounding options</a> for those looking to get into more professional recordings, but if you just want a mic upgrade for your work calls that's easy to set up and won't take up a ton of room on your desk, the Yeti Nano is a decent value when it's discounted to this extent.

The 4K media player has regularly bounced between this deal price and its MSRP of $55 in recent months, but for less than $40 it's a good value for those who want to add more streaming services to their TV.

What problems might generative AI pose for the privacy of the average internet user? The answer, according to experts, is largely a matter of how these bots are trained and how much we plan to interact with them</p><p>In order to replicate human-like interactions, AI chatbots are trained on mass amounts of data, a significant portion of which is derived from repositories like <a href=\"https://commoncrawl.org/\">Common Crawl</a>. As the name suggests, Common Crawl has amassed years and petabytes worth of data simply from crawling and scraping the open web. \u201cThese models are training on large data sets of publicly available data on the internet,\u201d Megha Srivastava, PhD student at Stanford's computer science department and former AI resident with Microsoft Research, said. Even though ChatGPT and Bard use what they call a \"<a href=\"https://medium.com/@dlaytonj2/chatgpt-show-me-the-data-sources-11e9433d57e8\">filtered</a>\" portion of Common Crawl's data, the sheer size of the model makes it \"impossible for anyone to kind of look through the data and sanitize it,\u201d according to Srivastava.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Either through your own carelessness or the poor security practices by a third-party could be in some far-flung corner of the internet right now. Even though it might be difficult to access for the average user, it's possible that information was scraped into a training set, and could be regurgitated by that chatbot down the line. And a bot spitting out someone's actual contact information is in no way a theoretical concern. <em>Bloomberg </em>columnist Dave Lee posted on Twitter that, when someone asked ChatGPT to chat on encrypted messaging platform Signal, it provided his exact phone number. This sort of interaction is likely an edge case, but the information these learning models have access to is still worth considering. \"It\u2019s unlikely that OpenAI would want to collect specific information like healthcare data and attribute it to individuals in order to train its models,\" David Hoelzer, a fellow at security organization the SANS Institute, told Engadget. \u201cBut could it inadvertently be in there? Absolutely.\u201d</p><p>Open AI, the company behind ChatGPT, did not respond when we asked what measures it takes to protect data privacy, or how it handles personally identifiable information that may be scraped into its training sets. So we did the next best thing and asked ChatGPT itself. It told us that it is \"programmed to follow ethical and legal standards that protect users\u2019 privacy and personal information\" and that it doesn't \"have access to personal information unless it is provided to me.\" Google for its part told Engadget it programmed similar guardrails into Bard to prevent the sharing of personally identifiable information during conversations.</p><p>Helpfully, ChatGPT brought up the second major vector by which generative AI might pose a privacy risk: usage of the software itself \u2014 either via information shared directly in chatlogs or device and user information captured by the service during use. OpenAI\u2019s <a href=\"https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy\">privacy policy</a> cites several categories of standard information it collects on users, which could be identifiable, and upon starting it up, ChatGPT does caution that conversations may be reviewed by its AI trainers to improve systems.&nbsp;</p><p>Google's Bard, meanwhile, does not have a standalone privacy policy, instead uses the <a href=\"https://policies.google.com/\">blanket privacy document</a> shared by other Google products (and which happens to be tremendously broad.) Conversations with Bard don't have to be saved to the user's Google account, and <a href=\"http://www.myactivity.google.com/product/bard\">users can delete the conversations via Google</a>, the company told Engadget. \u201cIn order to build and sustain user trust, they're going to have to be very transparent around privacy policies and data protection procedures at the front end,\u201d Rishi Jaitly, professor and distinguished humanities fellow at Virginia Tech, told Engadget.</p><p>Despite having a \"clear conversations\" action, pressing that does not actually delete your data, according to the service\u2019s <a href=\"https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6783457-chatgpt-general-faq\">FAQ page</a>, nor is OpenAI is able to delete specific prompts. While the company discourages users from sharing anything sensitive, seemingly the only way to remove personally identifying information provided to ChatGPT is to <a href=\"https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6378407-how-can-i-delete-my-account\">delete your account, </a>which the company says will permanently remove all associated data.</p><p>Hoelzer told Engadget he\u2019s not worried that ChatGPT is ingesting individual conversations in order to learn. But that conversation data is being stored somewhere, and so its security becomes a reasonable concern. Incidentally, ChatGPT was taken offline briefly in March because a programming error <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/chatgpt-briefly-went-offline-after-a-bug-revealed-user-chat-histories-115632504.html\">revealed information about users\u2019 chat histories</a>. It's unclear this early in their broad deployment if chat logs from these sorts of AI will become valuable targets for malicious actors.</p><p>For the foreseeable future, it's best to treat these sorts of chatbots with the same suspicion users should be treating any other tech product. \u201cA user playing with these models should enter with expectation that any interaction they're having with the model,\" Srivastava told Engadget, \"it's fair game for Open AI or any of these other companies to use for their benefit.\u201d</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/what-do-ai-chatbots-know-about-us-and-who-are-they-sharing-it-with-140013949.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/what-do-ai-chatbots-know-about-us-and-who-are-they-sharing-it-with-140013949.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-07 14:00:13+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "\u2018Super Mario Bros. Movie' review: A fun but safe Mushroom Kingdom romp", "description": "<p><em>Super Mario Bros. </em>is an almost perfect kids film. It's stunningly animated, it has enough momentum to keep youngins from being bored, and almost every character is unique and likable (even Bowser himself, thanks to the comedic stylings of Jack Black). It's clear that Nintendo didn't want to repeat the mistakes of that <em>other</em> Mario movie, the live-action 1993 film that's ironically beloved by some '90s kids (it's all we had!), but ultimately failed to capture the magic of the games. This film, meanwhile, is chock full of everything you'd remember from NIntendo's ouvre. It's a nostalgic romp for adults, and it's simply a fun time for children.</p><p>But boy is it safe. Maybe I'm a bit spoiled by the excellent non-Pixar animated films we've seen over the last decade, especially the ones that Phil Lord and Chris Miller have touched (<em>The Lego Movie! Into the Spider-Verse!)</em>. But it's glaringly obvious Nintendo didn't want to take any major creative risks with this adaptation. The script from Matthew Fogel is filled with enough humor and references to keep us from feeling bored, and directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic deliver some inspired sequences. But it's almost like the film is trapped in a nostalgia castle thanks to the whims of an aging corporate dinosaur. (Bear with me.)</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img alt=\"Toad and Princess Peach in The Super Mario Bros.

It's in line with the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-18-sonic-the-hedgehog-live-action-movie-review.html\">recent live-action Sonic the Hedgehog movie</a> \u2014 <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> is \"fine.\" There's no attempt to achieve anything deeper than the basics: Mario (voiced by Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day) are two floundering Brooklyn plumbers who are inexplicably transported to the Mushroom Kingdom. Luigi, ever the scaredy-cat, is almost instantly captured by Bowser's minions, and it's up to Mario and Princess Peach (an effervescent Anya Taylor-Joy) to save him. Big bad Bowser, meanwhile, has plans to either marry Peach or, barring that, take over the kingdom.</p><p>The film bombards you with an endless series of references from the start \u2013 just look at all those <em>Punch-Out! </em>characters on the wall! \u2013 something that will either delight longtime Nintendo fans or make your eyes roll. Personally, though, I mostly enjoyed seeing how all of the nostalgia fodder was deployed (the <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/1248705/lumalee-best-character-super-mario-bros-movie/\">adorably fatalistic Lumalee</a> from <em>Mario Galaxy </em>practically steals the film). The filmmakers also show off plenty of visual flair, like an early scene in Brooklyn that rotates into a 2D chase sequence. If only some of the musical choices were more creative. (A <em>Kill Bill</em> reference? Bonnie Tyler's \"Holding Out for a Hero\" during Mario's training montage? <em>Come on</em>.)</p><div id=\"274b1402b5b74ceb84b9829de1ffae01\"></div><p>It's always nice to see kids movies reach far beyond our expectations \u2014 <em>The Lego Movie</em> wrestled with the prison of capitalism, the importance of pushing against restrictive social expectations and how fandom can ruin the thing you actually love, all <em>in addition</em> to being a fun adventure for kids <em>and</em> injecting a dose of smart humor for adults. In <em>Super Marios Bros., </em>Mario learns to eat mushrooms because they literally make him big and strong. What subtext!</p><p>At the same time, I can still respect a movie that simply accomplishes its goal of entertaining children. Over the years, I've been subjected to <em>plenty</em> of truly awful kid's films with ugly animation and production design, lazy writing, and zero creative vision. I wish I could reclaim the time I spent watching <em>Space Jam: A New Legacy </em>or the 2011 <em>Smurfs</em> movie. <em>The Super Mario Bros. </em>may be a bit basic and safe, but it's not a waste of time.</p><section><img alt=\"Bowser and Luigi in The Super Mario Bros. Movie\" class=\"e2ehero-url\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/346f6d40-d549-11ed-bbff-59b7b98791cc\" style=\"height: 887px; width: 2148px;\" /></section><p>For one, we've never seen Mario and the Mushroom Kingdom look this good. Illumination may not have the stellar track record of Pixar, but this movie is filled with gorgeously detailed characters, vibrant worlds jam-packed with detail and some of the most fluid animation I've seen in years. It's a visual feast, and it makes me long for the day when a Mario game can look so lush (as much as I <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-26-super-mario-odyssey-nintendo-switch-review.html\">loved Super Mario Odyssey</a><em>, </em>it's visuals are held back by the Switch's aging hardware).</p><p>And for the most part, the voice acting kept me invested. Jack Black is inspired as Bowser, a hopeless romantic who can only express his feelings through song and world domination. Charlie Day basically plays his usual harried persona, but it fits Luigi, a character who mainly exists to support his little bigger brother. And Anya Taylor-Joy makes for a perfect Princess Peach, a leader who has to feign bravery to protect her adorable Mushroom Kingdom people.</p><figure><img alt=\"Mario gearing up for action in The Super Mario Bros. Movie\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/346f6d41-d549-11ed-b7fb-893897a0d2dd\" style=\"height: 898px; width: 2148px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Nintendo/Illumination</div></figure><p>For all of Chris Pratt's hype about his Mario voice, though, it's merely serviceable. The movie jokes about Charles Martinet's original problematic accent (Martinet also voices two characters in the film), but Pratt's spin on it just feels like someone pretending to be a schlubby Brooklynite. That's particularly surprising since Pratt injected so much life into his <em>Lego Movie</em> lead.</p><p>What's most disappointing about <em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie </em>is that it's so close to being genuinely great. If the film had more time to build up its characters, or if it made room for Jack Black unleash his full Tenacious D talents as Bowser, it would easily be stronger. Why not go a bit harder on that Mario Kart sequence? (Even Moana managed to fit in a <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> reference!) Why not spend a bit more time on the rivalry/budding bromance between Donkey Kong (Seth Rogen) and Mario?</p><p>With a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ScottMendelson/status/1644019781128048640\">projected opening weekend of $150 million</a> or more, it's clear that Nintendo has a hit on its hands. A sequel is inevitable. I just hope that the company loosens up the next time around.

It expects to earn just 600 billion won ($455 million) for the first quarter of 2023, a drop of 96 percent from the same period last year. It blamed falling demand for memory chips, a situation that could be a bad sign for the tech industry as a whole.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;We\u2019re adjusting to lower memory production to a meaningful level... in addition to optimizing line operations that are already underway,\u201d Samsung said in a statement. It added that it would continue to invest in clean room infrastructure and expand R&amp;D spending, as it sees improved memory chip demand in the mid- to long-term.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Although it trails Taiwan's TSMC in other areas, Samsung is the global leader in DRAM and NAND flash memory chip production with 40.7 and 31.4 percent shares respectively. Such chips are used in consumer devices of all kinds, ranging from smartwatches to mobile phones and laptops. The oversupply of memory chips is therefore a sign that demand for such products has fallen significantly due to an ongoing global economic slowdown.&nbsp;</p><p>The slowdown comes just a short time after one of the biggest tech industry booms of all time, powered by the COVID-19 pandemic. Since late in 2021, however, memory prices have dropped through the floor, with DRAM and NAND prices down by 20 and 15 percent in just the last quarter alone. One bright spot for Samsung has been sales of its new Galaxy S23 smartphone, which helped bolster profits, the company said. It will reveal more details in its earnings report set to drop at the end of April.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/samsung-warns-of-lower-profits-amid-falling-demand-for-memory-chips-113551159.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/samsung-warns-of-lower-profits-amid-falling-demand-for-memory-chips-113551159.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-07 11:35:51+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Apple's Mac Mini M2 models fall to new all-time lows", "description": "<p>Apple's Mac Mini M2 computers are the cheapest way to get the company's latest processors, and now Amazon is offering them at the lowest prices we've ever seen.

It's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mac-mini-review-m2-pro-2023-140052205.html\">tiny but mighty</a>, with the M2 processor easily powerful enough for productivity chores and multitasking. The chip combines computing operations, like CPU, GPU, input/output interfaces and certain memory processes into one \"system on a chip,\" allowing for faster processing speeds.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>On top of that, you get killer connectivity, with two Thunderbolt 4 USB-C connections, HDMI 2.0 (with 4K 240Hz and 8K 60Hz output), two USB-A ports, a headphone jack and gigabit Ethernet (upgradeable to 10 gigabit). The M2 Pro model adds two additional USB-C ports, making it even more useful for creatives with a ton of accessories.</p><p>The Mac Mini M2 won't replace your gaming machine, but it can handle nearly everything else you throw at it. We wouldn't recommend the overpriced storage or RAM upgrades either, as the M2 is much more efficient with RAM than typical PCs. Still, if you're looking for a cheap but powerful Mac, this is the way to go.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter and </em><a href=\"https://subscription.yahoo.net/Newsletter/Preference/sub?b=engadgetdeals&amp;src\"><em>subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter</em></a><em> for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apples-mac-mini-m2-models-fall-to-new-all-time-lows-100512675.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/apples-mac-mini-m2-models-fall-to-new-all-time-lows-100512675.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-07 10:05:12+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Google's WebGPU is coming to Chrome to boost online gaming and graphics", "description": "<p>Google will soon start rolling out WebGPU, a new feature that will allow Chrome browsers to use your graphics card to accelerate games, graphics and AI, the company <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/blog/webgpu-release/\">announced</a>.

The API has been in development for over six years, and should be available to Firefox and Safari down the road (Edge often gets features at the same time as Chrome), and expand to more operating systems like Android. You can try the feature for yourself if you're on the Chrome Beta track using a demo called <a href=\"https://babylonjs.com/\">Babylon.js</a>, which already offers full WebGPU support.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/googles-webgpu-is-coming-to-chrome-to-boost-online-gaming-and-graphics-085305456.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/googles-webgpu-is-coming-to-chrome-to-boost-online-gaming-and-graphics-085305456.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-07 08:53:05+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
