Oh, and we get a Thrawn glimpse in there for good measure.\n\nIf you\u2019re not caught up with Star Wars Rebels, The Clone Wars, and The Bad Batch, though, you may not know who\u2019s who in this new trailer! Here\u2019s a quick trailer breakdown to get you ready for next year\u2019s Ahsoka.\n\nYou\u2019ve already met Ahsoka Tano, but the incredible Sabine Wren, Hera Syndulla and Ezra Bridger will be joining the fray to help the Jedi stop the nefarious Grand Admiral Thrawn. Most of these characters have interacted together in one way or another in the past, but this is the first time that we\u2019ll get Ahsoka with this crew in live-action. (With Ahsoka herself making her live-action debut in The Mandalorian Season 2.)\n\nWhat new Star Wars lore will we see cooked up in Ahsoka on Disney Plus?

Fast X, the tenth film in the Fast & Furious saga, stars Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris \u201cLudacris\u201d Bridges, Jason Momoa, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jordana Brewster, John Cena, Jason Statham, Sung Kang, Alan Ritchson, Daniela Melchior, Scott Eastwood, with Helen Mirren, Charlize Theron, Brie Larson, and Rita Moreno.\n\nOver many missions and against impossible odds, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his family have outsmarted, out-nerved and outdriven every foe in their path. Now, they confront the most lethal opponent they\u2019ve ever faced: A terrifying threat emerging from the shadows of the past who\u2019s fueled by blood revenge, and who is determined to shatter this family and destroy everything\u2014and everyone\u2014that Dom loves, forever. \n\nIn 2011\u2019s Fast Five, Dom and his crew took out nefarious Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes and decapitated his empire on a bridge in Rio De Janeiro. What they didn\u2019t know was that Reyes\u2019 son, Dante (Aquaman\u2019s Jason Momoa), witnessed it all and has spent the last 12 years masterminding a plan to make Dom pay the ultimate price. \n\nDante\u2019s plot will scatter Dom\u2019s family from Los Angeles to the catacombs of Rome, from Brazil to London and from Portugal to Antarctica. New allies will be forged and old enemies will resurface. But everything changes when Dom discovers that his own 8-year-old son (Leo Abelo Perry, Black-ish) is the ultimate target of Dante\u2019s vengeance. \n\nFast X is produced by Neal H. Moritz, Vin Diesel, Justin Lin, Jeff Kirschenbaum and Samantha Vincent. The executive producers are Joseph M. Caracciolo, Jr., David Cain, Chris Morgan, Amanda Lewis and Mark Bomback.\n\nFast X, directed by Louis Leterrier, opens in theaters on May 19, 2023.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLkDfczU1UM", "date_published": "2023-04-07 20:00:06+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Will Nintendo Movies Become Bigger Than Marvel's?", "description": "With The Super Mario Bros.
