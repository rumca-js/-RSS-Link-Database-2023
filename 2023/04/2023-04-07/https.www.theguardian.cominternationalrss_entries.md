<p>New law – condemned as ‘illegitimate giveaway to the oil and gas industry’ – requires state parks to be leased to interested parties</p><p>Environmental groups have launched a last-minute effort to halt an extraordinary new law in Ohio that requires government agencies to lease state parks and other public state lands to the oil and gas industry.</p><p><a href="https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/complaint_hb507-final-6apr2023.pdf">A temporary injunction filed</a> on Thursday seeks to put the brakes on legislation that requires state parks to be leased for fracking and which redefines the potent greenhouse gas methane as “green energy”.

## The Power of Language by Viorica Marian review – the virtues of multilingualism

<p>An eloquent but relentless attempt to prove the superiority of polyglots fails to convince</p><p>Disclosure: this reviewer is pi-lingual, a word coined by <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/01/the-shallowness-of-google-translate/551570/">Douglas Hofstadter</a> to describe people who speak three languages and can also have a cringingly inept conversation with a taxi driver in a couple more. Any book like this one, which purports to prove scientifically that polyglots are superior, has my vote. All the more since no great diligence was required of me to achieve this, aside from tagging along with my parents and a couple of patient English girlfriends met at an impressionable age. I therefore picked up this account of the virtues of multilingualism in smug mode, channelling my son who, at age 7, was fond of starting conversations with strangers with “I speak three languages, how many do you speak?”, which unsurprisingly won him few friends.</p><p>I was not prepared for the number of scientific reasons this (overlong) book provides for additional smugness and fewer friends. Viorica Marian, who was born in Moldova, speaking Russian and Romanian, immigrated to the US and is now a professor at Northwestern University, has clearly made a living out of making monolingual colleagues – which in her neck of the woods must be a majority – feel inadequate. The first half of The Power of Language is a relentless, and eloquently written, studies-have-shown gallop through her work and that of her peers. All of which supposedly demonstrates, ad nauseam, that polyglots are measurably better than monoglots at almost everything: smarter, more inventive, more adaptable.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/07/the-power-of-language-by-viorica-marian-review-the-virtues-of-multilingualism">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ex-CEO Charlie Javice, 31, is just the latest from the magazine’s list to see criminal charges</p><p>Just a few years ago, Charlie Javice was riding high. In 2019 the tech CEO landed a spot on Forbes’s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/charlie-javice/?sh=406986de9619">30 Under 30 list</a> for her work on a startup called Frank, which she described as “<a href="https://www.popsugar.com/news/Frank-FAFSA-Founder-CEO-Charlie-Javice-Interview-44518650">Amazon for higher education</a>”. What does that catchy but completely empty phrase mean? It means Frank helped students navigate the financial aid process. It was apparently so successfully at doing this that JPMorgan Chase acquired the company for $175m in 2021 and Javice was made a managing partner at the bank. The entrepreneur shared the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/frank-now-part-jp-morgan-chase-family-charlie-javice/?src=aff-ref&amp;trk=aff-ir_progid.8005_partid.10078_sid._adid.449670&amp;clickid=XpsxERTPZxyNUtZSSOxx53ToUkATgM0VRUDn2s0&amp;mcid=6851962469594763264&amp;irgwc=1">news on LinkedIn</a>, boasting that in just four years Frank had grown to serve “over 5 million students at over 6,000 colleges”.</p><p>Turns out those numbers might have been just a teeny bit exaggerated. On Tuesday Javice, 31, was <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/former-start-ceo-charged-175-million-fraud">charged by the justice department</a> with “falsely and dramatically inflating the number of customers of her company” in order to get JPMorgan Chase to buy it. According to the lawsuit, Frank only had about 300,000 clients and fabricated data to show a larger customer base. She enlisted a data scientist to make up a few million customers, basically, and JPMorgan, which has about 240,000 employees and pays its CEO $34.5m for his expertise, didn’t seem to spot this in its due diligence.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/apr/06/forbes-30-under-30-tech-finance-prison">Continue reading...</a>

<p>He’s gone from dealing drugs to having No 1 hits and vying with Harry Styles for Brit awards.

The London rapper’s first two mixtapes – Wild West, from 2021, and 23, from 2022 – debuted at No 2 and No 1 in the UK, and he was nominated for British artist of the year at this year’s Brits alongside Harry Styles and Stormzy. Cee specialises in expressive streams of consciousness that contain a matrix of paradoxes – romantic and realist, hard and unguarded, nostalgic and present – and, crucially, he’s boyband-pretty. But while he has been a UK sensation for some time, this is his first concert in the US.</p><p>Help is on hand from the biggest rapper in the world, Drake, who sent his own tour technician to make sure Cee has a smooth stint on the road. “Drake said: ‘Take care of him,’” the roadie says before the show, acknowledging the difficulties Cee faces. “In America, getting into UK hip-hop is tough, unless you’re really into it.” But the 24-year-old has made short work of any obstacles thus far; Cee refers to his music as “ignorantly conscious”, and that clashing dichotomy is what has made it so infectious.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/07/central-cee-interview">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This fictionalised version of Cheryl Strayed’s agony aunt columns is an unashamed tearjerker. You’ll need to get used to oversharing – unless you want to be consumed with rage</p><p>The renaissance of Kathryn Hahn has been one of the few bright spots in the bleakness of the last few years. It officially began (though she had been ramping up her work via the likes of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/26/transparent-review-the-best-thing-on-tv-at-the-moment">Transparent</a> and the wonderful <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/11/mrs-fletcher-review-kathryn-hahn-tom-perrotta">Mrs Fletcher</a> before that) with her turn as nosy neighbour-cum-witch Agatha Harkness in Disney’s 2021 hit <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/jan/15/wandavision-review-elizabeth-olsen-paul-bettany-marvel-disney">WandaVision</a>, and she is now the central figure of the streaming platform’s new series Tiny Beautiful Things.</p><p>The drama is based on Cheryl Strayed’s 2012 collection of essays of the same name, which were themselves based on the responses she used to write for the Dear Sugar problem page of online literary magazine the Rumpus. Into it, she channelled her many and varied life experiences – good and extraordinarily bad, all of which would become familiar to millions when her memoir, Wild, went on to be an Oprah-anointed global phenomenon. She delivered compassionate and brilliantly written replies to those seeking solace from the anonymous agony aunt. If, to the average UK sensibility, they often veered towards the emetic and set off oversharing alarm bells – well, that’s probably our problem and not hers. But it does mean that you might want to approach the latest iteration of her work with either caution or a determinedly open, uncynical mindset, however unnatural it feels. I think it’s the best way to get through it.</p><p>Tiny Beautiful Things is on Disney+</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/07/tiny-beautiful-things-review-kathryn-hahn-cheryl-strayed-disney">Continue reading...</a>
