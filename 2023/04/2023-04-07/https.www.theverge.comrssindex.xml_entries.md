  <p id="nAfR2m">Rivian unlocked a new Dual-Motor Performance AWD option for its R1T electric pickup truck and R1S SUV on Thursday, and the automaker is now allowing eligible order holders with configurator access to select the new drivetrain. The news comes after Rivian announced last month that “thousands” of R1T reservation holders <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/10/23634166/rivian-r1t-reservations-configure-order-delivery">will be receiving invitations</a> to configure their trucks for delivery in the next one to four months after order confirmation.</p>

## Substack writers say Twitter’s newsletter ban is bad for business — and worse for Twitter

  <p id="VpLfem">This week, Twitter began restricting the promotion of links to Substack newsletters, a move that seems to fly in the face of owner Elon Musk’s vocal support of free speech on the platform. The change is a huge problem for Substack writers, who have found Twitter to be one of the best places to attract new subscribers to their newsletters.</p>
<p id="QEqori">“It appears that Musk is making decisions based on his own financial interests and petty grievances — even if it makes Twitter objectively worse for users,” Judd Legum, author of <a href="https://popular.info/"><em>Popular Information</em></a>, a politics-focused newsletter with more than 240,000 subscribers, says in an email to <em>The Verge</em>. “If this continues, it’s hard to justify continuing to invest my time creating content on Twitter.”</p>

  <p id="zTP24y">Artificial intelligence has... let’s say, a <em>fraught</em> relationship with the arts community, and transformative fandom is no exception. Many fans have embraced some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23627402/character-ai-fandom-chat-bots-fanfiction-role-playing">tools like Character.ai bots</a>, but plenty have also bristled at the prospect of text generators getting trained on their fanfiction; in my fandom circles, I’ve seen a few people say the prospect of an AI-created content flood discourages them from writing. And in the past week, the backlash has created an odd second-order complication: someone is rampantly accusing <em>non</em>-AI fan writers of being “AI-using cheaters,” and as far as I can tell, nobody quite knows why.</p>

  <p id="HRm6dJ">The Foxconn land in Wisconsin may finally be used for a meaningful technology project — but not by Foxconn.</p>
<p id="IgThAy">Last week, the village board of Mount Pleasant voted to allow Microsoft to build a data center on land previously cleared for the Foxconn LCD fab that never arrived. Microsoft will buy the land for $50 million, some of which will be used to reimburse Foxconn for releasing its rights to the land. It does not appear that Foxconn will play any part in operating the data center itself. </p>
<p id="n2si54">The announcement came days before an election in which the board incumbents narrowly defeated challengers critical of the Foxconn deal.</p>
<p id="AQGSev">Foxconn spokesperson Rusty Schultz declined to comment on the record, instead pointing to an unattributed statement <a href="https://biztimes.com/microsoft-plans-to-create-a-1-billion-data-center-campus-on-foxconn-land/">p...</a></p>

  <p id="lRMRIx">Substack’s founders have responded to Twitter’s new restrictions on promoting tweets with links from the publishing platform, telling <em>The Verge</em> that writers’ livelihoods “should not be tied to platforms where they don’t own their relationship with their audience, and where the rules can change on a whim.”</p>
<p id="oGWarC">On Thursday night, Twitter users <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/6/23673043/twitter-substack-embeds-bots-tools-api">noticed that</a> they couldn’t like, reply to, or retweet some tweets that had Substack links in them. Twitter hasn’t said why it made the change — or if the change was even intentional — but the timing is certainly suspect, given that it happened about a day after Substack announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/5/23670452/substack-notes-tweets-posts-twitter">its own Twitter-like “Notes” product</a>. </p>

One reason: Microsoft could sabotage future <em>Call of Duty</em> games by making performance even <em>slightly</em> worse on PlayStation — because gamers are apparently so perceptive that it might make them move to Xbox.</p>

Lucasfilm confirmed today that the next live-action spinoff to hit Disney Plus will be <em>Ahsoka</em>, which will start streaming on Disney Plus in August 2023. The announcement was made during a panel at <em>Star Wars</em> Celebration 2023. We also got a first look at the show via a teaser trailer.</p>
<p id="i66TeK">Ahsoka the character made her first live-action appearance in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/20/21188465/rosario-dawson-ahsoka-tano-the-mandalorian-season-2-live-action">season 2 of <em>The Mandolorian</em></a><em>, </em>after originally being introduced in the animated shows. She’s played by Rosario Dawson who will be reprising her role for the new series.
