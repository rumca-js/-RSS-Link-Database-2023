Trina temporarily fought back tears as she recited \"Mama,\" a dedication to her late mother who died of cancer in 2019. The crew made the breakup anthem \"Here We Go\" feel even more aching. The energy in the space made a seismic shift when the band took on the bass-bumpin' classic \"Da Baddest Bitch,\" infusing the live arrangement with nimble guitar, charismatic drums and background vocalists so entertaining, their delivery felt like epic narration from the chorus of an ancient Greek play or, just as epically, a group homegirls hyping up their friend at the function. In the middle of it all was the 305 Queen herself, killing her verses with breath control, authority and bougie hair flips.\n\n\"I believe in who I am. The game didn't make me; I made the game. I made it,\" the Diamond Princess declared in her Louder Than A Riot interview before recording this Tiny Desk concert. \"I already came in with a motive and an initiative to know who I am from. That's why I breed a whole universe of bad bitches.\" To hear Trina's full interview, subscribe to NPR Music's Louder Than A Riot podcast.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Mama\"\n\"Da Baddest Bitch\"\n\"Single Again\"\n\"Here We Go\" \n\"Nann N****\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nTrina: vocals\nBigg D: guitar\nAlton Coley: bass\nJon Anderson: drums\nCory Irvin: keys\nAsher Makeba Williams: vocals\nNia McClain: vocals\nShannon McClain: vocals\nCorey \"C.O.\" Evans: vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducers: Bobby Carter, Sidney Madden\nDirector: Maia Stern\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin \nEditor: Joshua Bryant\nCreative Director: Bob Boilen \nVideographers: Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Sofia Seidel\nAudio Assistant: Neil Tevault \nProduction Assistants: Jill Britton, Alant\u00e9 Serene\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Maia Stern, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Ashley Pointer, Pilar Galv\u00e1n\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#NPRMusic #TinyDesk #Trina", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvsPwwphxrg", "date_published": "2023-04-07 09:00:11+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
