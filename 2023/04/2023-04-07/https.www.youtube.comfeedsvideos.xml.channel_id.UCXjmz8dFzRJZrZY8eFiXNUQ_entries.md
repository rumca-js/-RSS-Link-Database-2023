Will Smith's I Am Legend is the rare movie that could have been saved by it's alternate ending.  Theatrically I Am Legend ended with a bang, literally, but the ending left audiences with a bad taste in their mouth.  The original, true to the source material ending, would have been a more fitting end to the emotional arc of I Am Legend.  And it seems the studio agrees, after I Am Legend 2 was confirmed to be working off the original ending rather than the theatrical one.
