I asked a BUNCH of folks - players, painters, vendors, content creators - what they thought was the future of tabletop wargaming and hobby... but they only had 60 seconds or less.

Vince Venturella and I made another game! Check out Space Station Zero at http://www.spacestationzerogame.com

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
