The long-awaited Ahsoka trailer finally dropped at this year’s Star Wars Celebration, giving us a good look at our main protagonist as well as Natasha Liu Bordizzo’s Sabine Wren and Mary Elizabeth Winstead’s Hera Syndulla. Oh, and we get a Thrawn glimpse in there for good measure.

If you’re not caught up with Star Wars Rebels, The Clone Wars, and The Bad Batch, though, you may not know who’s who in this new trailer! Here’s a quick trailer breakdown to get you ready for next year’s Ahsoka.

You’ve already met Ahsoka Tano, but the incredible Sabine Wren, Hera Syndulla and Ezra Bridger will be joining the fray to help the Jedi stop the nefarious Grand Admiral Thrawn. Most of these characters have interacted together in one way or another in the past, but this is the first time that we’ll get Ahsoka with this crew in live-action. (With Ahsoka herself making her live-action debut in The Mandalorian Season 2.)

What new Star Wars lore will we see cooked up in Ahsoka on Disney Plus? The upcoming Ahsoka series promises lots of new adventures for the Rebels crew, as well as endless potential for new Star Wars theories and the continuation of many beloved stories.

## Fast X - Official 'A Look Inside' Behind the Scenes Clip (2023) Vin Diesel, Jason Momoa

Join members of the cast and crew for a behind-the-scenes look at the upcoming movie Fast X, as well as a discussion about the villain played by Jason Momoa and more. Fast X, the tenth film in the Fast & Furious saga, stars Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges, Jason Momoa, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jordana Brewster, John Cena, Jason Statham, Sung Kang, Alan Ritchson, Daniela Melchior, Scott Eastwood, with Helen Mirren, Charlize Theron, Brie Larson, and Rita Moreno.

Over many missions and against impossible odds, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his family have outsmarted, out-nerved and outdriven every foe in their path. Now, they confront the most lethal opponent they’ve ever faced: A terrifying threat emerging from the shadows of the past who’s fueled by blood revenge, and who is determined to shatter this family and destroy everything—and everyone—that Dom loves, forever. 

In 2011’s Fast Five, Dom and his crew took out nefarious Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes and decapitated his empire on a bridge in Rio De Janeiro. What they didn’t know was that Reyes’ son, Dante (Aquaman’s Jason Momoa), witnessed it all and has spent the last 12 years masterminding a plan to make Dom pay the ultimate price. 

Dante’s plot will scatter Dom’s family from Los Angeles to the catacombs of Rome, from Brazil to London and from Portugal to Antarctica. New allies will be forged and old enemies will resurface. But everything changes when Dom discovers that his own 8-year-old son (Leo Abelo Perry, Black-ish) is the ultimate target of Dante’s vengeance. 

Fast X is produced by Neal H. Moritz, Vin Diesel, Justin Lin, Jeff Kirschenbaum and Samantha Vincent. The executive producers are Joseph M. Caracciolo, Jr., David Cain, Chris Morgan, Amanda Lewis and Mark Bomback.

Fast X, directed by Louis Leterrier, opens in theaters on May 19, 2023.
