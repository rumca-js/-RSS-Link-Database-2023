  <p id="vc3N4k">Tesla will have a delivery event for its long-delayed Cybertruck in the third quarter of 2023, Elon Musk said during an earnings call with investors Wednesday. </p>
<p id="j0Al4U">After more than three years since its initial announcement, Cybertruck production is expected to start this summer — though Musk has said that volume production won’t begin until next year.</p>
<p id="aLgNL7">“It takes time to get the manufacturing line going, and this is really a very radical product,” Musk said Wednesday. “It’s not made in the way that other cars are made.”</p>

  <p id="xhsa1S">Elon Musk is threatening to take legal action against Microsoft over claims that the company “trained illegally using Twitter data.” The billionaire’s statement <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1648784955655192577?s=20">came in response</a> to a tweet noting that Microsoft’s advertising platform announced it would stop supporting Twitter, reportedly due to Twitter’s changes requiring payment to access its API.</p>
<p id="wiaubz">Musk’s threat is vague but appears to be over OpenAI using Twitter data to train the large language model behind products like ChatGPT. OpenAI, obviously, is not Microsoft, but it did recently receive <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/23/23567448/microsoft-openai-partnership-extension-ai">a significant investment from the company</a>, which is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/7/23587454/microsoft-bing-edge-chatgpt-ai">building AI into tools like Bing</a>, Edge, and Microsoft 365.</p>

  <p id="xICVT1">Twitter reiterated today that it’s going to remove legacy <a href="https://twitter.com/verified/status/1648764138452299778">verified checkmarks tomorrow, April 20th</a>. Yes, that does mean Elon Musk’s Twitter intends to remove the last vestiges of what he once deemed the <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1587498907336118274">“lords &amp; peasants system”</a> on 4/20, ha ha.</p>
<p id="pT5tHH">The thing is, I won’t believe Twitter until it actually happens. The company originally said that it would “begin” removing checkmarks <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/23/23654206/twitter-legacy-blue-verified-checkmarks-april-fools-day">on April 1st</a>, but as far as I know, that hasn’t taken place. (Well, outside of Twitter removing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/3/23667751/twitter-legacy-blue-checkmark-wind-down-chaos"><em>The New York Times’</em> verified checkmark</a> after the publication said it <a href="https://twitter.com/oliverdarcy/status/1641460482480504832">wouldn’t pay</a> the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/4/23585612/twitter-gold-checkmark-business-subscription">reportedly high fees</a> for organizational accounts, but it seems like <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1642383150230773760">Musk made sure that happened</a>.)</p>

  <p id="bUksXf">Stability AI, the company behind the AI-powered Stable Diffusion image generator, has released a suite of open-source large language models (LLMs) collectively called StableLM. In <a href="https://stability.ai/blog/stability-ai-launches-the-first-of-its-stablelm-suite-of-language-models">a post shared on Wednesday</a>, the company announced that its models are now available for developers to use and adapt <a href="https://github.com/stability-AI/stableLM/">on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p id="8AzquI">Like its ChatGPT rival, StableLM is designed to efficiently generate text and code. It’s trained on a larger version of the open-source dataset known as <a href="https://pile.eleuther.ai/">the Pile</a>, which encompasses information from a range of sources, including Wikipedia, Stack Exchange, and PubMed. Stability AI says StableLM models are currently available between 3 billion and 7 billion parameters, with 15 to 65 billion parameter models arriving later.</p>

  <p id="Qh9PM6">Volkswagen’s flagship electric vehicle, the ID.4 crossover SUV, is eligible for the full $7,500 federal EV tax credit, the automaker announced Wednesday. The federal government’s list of eligible vehicles has since been updated to include all trim levels of the ID.4. </p>

  <p id="og4K03">Google Fi is getting a new name and some new features. The service is now going by the name Google Fi Wireless, adding some much-needed clarity as to the nature of Google’s relatively unknown wireless carrier, and it’s adding new perks for subscribers as it rolls out the updated branding.</p>

The service is also expanding smartwatch support to its Simply Unlimited plan, where previously it was only available on Google Fi’s Unlimited Plus and Flexible plans. All three plans support smartwatch connections at no additional cost, allowing the devices to stay connected without a phone. The device options here...</p>
