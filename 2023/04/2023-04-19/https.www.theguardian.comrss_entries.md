<p>If ministers pretend the journey to equality is complete, the role of racism in health inequalities will go undiagnosed</p><p>In recent years, Conservative ministers have sought to debunk institutional racism, with the government-ordered Sewell report concluding that its existence in Britain is “not borne out by the evidence”. Yet the evidence is incontrovertible, particularly in health. A recent example comes from a <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5803/cmselect/cmwomeq/94/report.html" title="">report</a> published by the women and equalities committee, which finds that black women are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/apr/18/mps-condemn-failure-to-tackle-glaring-racial-inequalities-in-uk-maternal-health" title="">almost four times more likely</a> to die as a result of childbirth than white women. MPs behind the report have rightly denounced the government’s failure to address this gulf.</p><p>The statistic is not news. Racial inequalities in maternal healthcare have been documented for at least two decades. Serena Williams recently drew attention to this phenomenon in the US when <a href="https://www.elle.com/life-love/a39586444/how-serena-williams-saved-her-own-life/" title="">writing</a> about the birth of her daughter. The tennis player, who was at risk of blood clots, was told when requesting a scan that medicine was making her “talk crazy”. Once the scan was granted, it revealed what Ms Williams had suspected. The clots had returned. The resistance she faced is not uncommon. Research from the US shows how racist assumptions that black patients can endure more pain have resulted in doctors being <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4843483/" title="">less likely</a> to grant them adequate treatment. In Britain, black women report being <a href="https://www.birthrights.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Birthrights-inquiry-systemic-racism_exec-summary_May-22-web.pdf" title="">denied pain relief</a>, feeling <a href="https://www.fivexmore.com/blackmereport" title="">unsafe</a> and seeing their concerns ignored by midwives and doctors.</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

<p>The actor looks back over a four-decade career balancing ‘serious’ drama and improv comedy, describes the making of her wholly improvised new film, and explains why we don’t see her on TV so much any more</p><p>“I hope they don’t want me to look wacky,” frets Josie Lawrence on the way to the photoshoot for this interview, because she’s here to talk about a serious film. On the other hand, she’d love a plug for her regular Sunday night slot at <a href="https://www.chortle.co.uk/shows/misc_live_shows/c/18807/the_comedy_store_players">London’s Comedy Store</a>, where she has been improvising on and off for 38 years. The contradiction is a fact of life for a performer whose gift of the gab on Friday night TV bagged her a permanent place in the heart of the nation, eclipsing the parallel career in which she was excelling as a classical actor of Shakespeare and Stoppard.<br /><br />The interview is over lunch, at Lawrence’s request, though she looks momentarily horrified when a plate of long, chewy pasta arrives, dripping with the sort of sauce you really don’t want down your front for a photoshoot. She has arrived early, as she always does, and killed some time in a vintage shop close by, where she has bought herself an elegant coat dress. She jumps enthusiastically from her seat to show it off, exclaiming, at head-turning volume, “I’m terrible at buying clothes – my wardrobe is full of old things that I like to wear. But it’s funny how things turn up when you’re not looking.” Far from deliberately drawing attention to herself, she seems oblivious that other diners might recognise her.</p><p>Her new film neatly marries the two sides of her career. It is the story of a pair of middle-aged sisters who return to their childhood home after the death of their charismatic but difficult mother, and decide to make their clear-out into an art installation. Directed by Jon Sanders and titled A Clever Woman, the film was shot over 10 days in an old curiosity shop of a house on the Isle of Wight, and is an entirely improvised exploration of bereavement, memory and the bonds of sisterhood.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/19/josie-lawrence-as-soon-as-i-could-speak-i-was-putting-on-shows">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Backstabbing families fight turf wars in an astonishingly dramatic nature series from the director of My Octopus Teacher. It may put you in mind of Logan Roy and clan</p><p>For those who are not tired of the machinations and manoeuvrings at the heart of Waystar Royco, the Ngogo rainforest and its Chimp Empire have plenty to offer in the way of power struggles and inter-familial conflict. Moonlight’s Mahershala Ali narrates this saga of two rival chimp troops in Uganda, known as the Centrallers and the Westerners. Over four beautifully filmed and dramatically charged episodes, we follow the two troops’ never-ending battle for territory, as well as exploring the complex personal relationships within the groups themselves.</p><p>It is directed by James Reed, who won an Oscar for the underwater weepie <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/apr/26/my-octopus-teacher-wins-best-documentary-oscar">My Octopus Friend</a>. Reed has spent time with the Ngogo chimps before, for the 2017 film <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9035618/">Rise of the Warrior Apes</a>, but that was before they split off into two rival groups. Now, the dangers are more grave, and the lower-stakes storylines heaving with portent. The Central group, the largest ever recorded, has the ageing Jackson as its alpha, though there are younger, hungrier chimps biding their time, waiting for any weaknesses to make themselves apparent.</p><p>Chimp Empire is on Netflix.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/19/chimp-empire-review-this-epic-tale-of-betrayal-is-like-succession-but-with-apes">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Terry Farrell, the distinguished creator of dazzling buildings worldwide, has set up a £4.6m centre in Newcastle aiming to demystify the overblown language of architecture. So why does it contain a compostable woolly bio-cave?</p><p>Architects are notoriously bad communicators. They have a tendency, while attempting to stride the multiple disciplines of construction, philosophy, sociology and art, to speak an opaque private language that is legible to none. Countless are the exhibitions where <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/may/21/venice-architecture-biennale-2021-review-how-will-we-live-together">visitors are confronted with indigestible word salads</a> of materialities, typologies, morphologies and phenomenologies, garnished with a good sprinkling of liminal palimpsests. It makes you want to run for the nearest the permeable threshold.</p><p>Planners can be just as bad. They casually throw around meaningless subjective terms like “in-keeping” and “overbearing”. What should be a transparent process of giving people a say over how their neighbourhoods are shaped has become a labyrinthine system of impenetrable complexity that would make Kafka jealous. In the tangled muddle of local plans, neighbourhood plans, masterplans and planning applications, it is almost impossible to find out what’s going on – and how your voice can be heard.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/19/woollen-home-newcastle-terry-farrell-centre">Continue reading...</a>

Not long after that League One playoff final defeat at the hands of Rotherham, longtime owner Barry Hearn sold his stake in the club to Italian businessman Francesco Bechetti, a transaction the snooker loopy promoter and lifelong Orient fan would later describe as “an absolute disaster”. Despite initially hosing plenty of money at the club, Bechetti’s reign <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/feb/10/leyton-orient-spiteful-owner-frnacesco-becchetti">went quickly downhill</a>, ending three seasons, 11 managers and two relegations later when the O’s dropped out of the Football League after a 112-year stay, with the club in all manner of Bechetti-induced financial chaos.</p><p>I’m a Rochdale fan and have no skin in the game (as we will be exiting the Football League shortly). However, I like Leeds and dislike Everton. To which version of God should I pray? Or would this be an ecumenical matter?” – Nick Livesey.</p><p>It’s interesting to see that Didier Drogba says Chelsea <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/18/didier-drogba-chelsea-now-lacks-class-i-dont-recognise-the-club">now lack class</a> and that they should go back to the principles and values they had when he was there.

To be fair though, it’s got to be a better tactic than having all your chances fall to Kai Havertz and N’Golo Kanté” – Noble Francis.</p><p>Good luck to Stranraer and their new manager (yesterday’s News, Bits and Bobs, full email edition). I hope appointing someone who beat them 8-0 works as well for them as it did for Norwich City, after they were shellacked 7-1 at home by Colchester on the opening day of their first season in League One.

## What did I learn from Thomas Hardy? Great characters don’t need a back story | Adrian Chiles

<p>In the 21st century, we are used to picking through the psychological pain and peril of all our fictional heroes. Perhaps we should stop</p><p>You never know art better than that which you’re forced to study as a teenager. For my (failed) O-level in music I had no choice but to listen in some detail to Malcolm Arnold’s Four Scottish Dances, Beethoven’s Pathétique piano sonata and Fauré’s Requiem. For a lad obsessed with the likes of Led Zeppelin, at the time this represented a traumatic listening experience. But it taught me a valuable lesson: if you’re exposed to any piece of art long enough, eventually it will move you. No pain, no gain, possibly. I’ve loved all three pieces ever since. OK, I failed the O-level, but I can hardly see it as a failure given it opened up a whole genre of music I might have missed. The Requiem has been particularly important to me. I listen to it driving home from the football whenever my team have lost. I listen to it often.</p><p>As far as literature is concerned, Thomas Hardy’s The Mayor of Casterbridge was a different kettle of fish. I loved it from page one. The first three paragraphs alone still make me want to applaud with my hands above my head, like I do when my team take to the field. Exactly 40 years since my O-level English literature exam (passed, with a grade A, since you ask), I decided to re-read it. Some passages feel as familiar as my name and address, while others – concerning the plot, mainly – ring no bells at all. Weird.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/19/what-did-i-learn-from-thomas-hardy-great-characters-dont-need-a-back-story">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘The Casualties Union act out injuries for hospitals, emergency services – and police preparing for suicide attacks. Their work requires precision performance’</p><p>This was my first project after my 20-year collaboration with Adam Broomberg came to a close in 2021. I had never really worked as an artist or a photographer on my own, but I think we both needed to see what it felt like. Our photos had been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/feb/05/digital-death-mask-photography-broomberg-and-chanarin-spirit-is-a-bone">highly conceptual</a>, and I wanted to return to why I first became a photographer: going out into the world with a feeling of wonder, watching and having experiences with strangers. So that’s what I spent 2022 doing: meeting pensioner groups, carnival troupes, gender activists and, as this image shows, attending a meeting of the Casualties Union, who were perfecting wound makeup.</p><p>The Casualties Union, a group of volunteers that has been operational since the second world war, is used by hospitals, the emergency services and even corporate clients, to test out catastrophe scenarios. If the police were staging a hypothetical suicide attack in London, they would need casualties that not only looked like the real thing but acted like the real thing. There’s a lot of performance required, and real precision about the way the volunteers act out injuries.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/19/knife-back-oliver-frank-chanarins-best-photograph-casualties-union">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A macho ex-cop falls for a mysterious stranger in this romance that doubles as a subtle state-of-the-nation drama</p><p>Apparently, the new arthouse flex is dropping your opening credits half an hour or more into the film, as in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jul/14/drive-my-car-review-hamaguchi-murakami">Drive My Car</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/20/long-days-journey-into-night-review-3d">Long Day’s Journey Into Night</a> – and now Aly Muritiba’s desolate and sophisticated Brazilian romantic quest Private Desert. Here, it’s all the better to accentuate the barren terrain from which it emerges. Brawny police instructor Daniel (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/15/bacurau-review-brazil-outback-western-cannes">Bacurau</a>’s Antonio Saboia) is suspended for attacking a recruit and forced to take on punishing night shifts as a security guard. At home he battles to convince his sister to do her fair share of caring for their dementia-stricken father, also a former policeman. Daniel’s only succour is the WhatsApp-based relationship he has with Sara, a woman somewhere in Brazil’s north. Then she starts ghosting him.</p><p>Prologue done, Daniel snaps and hits the road in search of his Awol paramour. He flyposts the area near the inland city of Petrolina with shots of Sara. But when they finally cross paths under nightclub lights, she turns out not to be who she says. There is a change of styles from the intro’s sepulchral tableaus to something more loose and fluid, and Muritiba excels at infusing his drama with subtle state-of-the-nation resonance. There seem to be two Brazils, circling but constantly misunderstanding one another. Daniel – making jokes as his father puts his “pistol” away as he washes him – is in hock to sclerotic macho ideals. But are things any less unhappy elsewhere? The people around Sara – like Fernando (Thomas Aquino), the protective friend who screens Daniel – spin out exploitative fantasies but remain dependent on and defined by those whom they feed off.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/19/private-desert-review-elegant-love-story-blooms-in-brazils-uneasy-backwaters">Continue reading...</a>

<p>McAdams nixed the likes of Mission Impossible, Casino Royale and The Devil Wears Prada – but there’d be no Game Night if things had gone differently</p><p>Hollywood etiquette dictates that when a Hollywood star passes on a role, they don’t talk about it. To do so wouldn’t be fair on the actor who eventually took the role, since this would doom them to an indefinite future of potentially invidious comparisons.</p><p>There are exceptions, of course. Matt Damon tells a nice story about how he didn’t want to star in Avatar, largely out of faux bitterness at the payday he missed out on. Brad Pitt, too, will admit that he turned down the role of Neo in The Matrix, but this is famously the only instance he’ll name. The other exception, of course, is Rachel McAdams. This is because Rachel McAdams will happily tell everyone all about the weird two years in her life where she basically turned down every great role going.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/19/rachel-mcadams-turned-down-a-string-of-huge-movies-and-we-should-all-be-thankful">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Medical practitioners are not the only experts in the field of disease and injury, as these personal stories of trauma and recovery show</p><p>The story of medicine is commonly framed as a steady accumulation of life-prolonging discoveries, inventions and practices. But seen through another lens, it is a story of competition for the title of “expert” in matters of healing – a tug-of-war over whose knowledge is valuable, who should make decisions, who achieves better results, who deserves resources. Was it the <em>āšipu</em> (“sorcerer”) or <em>asu</em> (“physician”) in ancient Mesopotamia? The mother, the midwife or the physician during modern childbirth?</p><p>Neurologist Oliver Sacks was often credited with creating the template for the modern medical memoir in the 1970s. More recently it has been enriched by the likes of Atul Gawande, Gavin Francis, and Gabriel Weston, gifted physicians and writers who use patient case studies as a springboard to explore illness, the science behind it, and the existential dilemmas it gives rise to. The science in these books is not incidental; it thrusts pathology into the pages as a central character, variously demanding the physician’s and patient’s understanding, negotiation, appeasement and reconciliation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/19/top-10-medical-memoirs-by-patients">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Deep Silver; PC, PS4/5, Xbox Series X/S<br /></strong>Hacking at the undead in post-apocalyptic LA <em>is </em>a lot of fun, but the game’s delayed release has made it sluggish and limited</p><p>Once in a while, the story behind a game’s development is more epic than anything being shown on screen. This is one of those occasions. Work on a sequel to 2011 survival adventure Dead Island began in 2012, but the project has since been through at least three development studios on its tortured route to release. German studio Yager had three years on the project before publisher Deep Silver passed it on to Sumo Digital for another three years until it washed up with Dambusters, Deep Silver’s own in-house studio. It’s a credit to everyone involved that it actually functions as a finished product, albeit one that shows the scars of its troubled gestation.</p><p>The sequel shifts the action to a post-apocalyptic version of Los Angeles, where the narrative stumbles between sprawling Beverly Hills mansions, Hollywood movie sets and sunny beaches. At the start you choose one of six characters, all with differing stats and special abilities, and while attempting to escape the city you must solve the mystery of how the contagion came about and whether or not there’s a cure. In between crushing the skulls of a thousand undead monsters, you also meet a variety of survivors – mostly stoners, preppers and superstar influencers – who all have a part to play in the emerging story.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/apr/19/dead-island-2-review-rolicking-zombie-hack-n-slasher-has-missed-its-moment">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It’s hard to imagine someone being shot for knocking on a stranger’s door in Finland, Spain, or Canada</p><p>In the past week, two people have been shot, in separate incidents, for making an innocent mistake. In Kansas City, Missouri, Ralph Yarl, 16, was shot in the head and critically wounded by 84-year-old Andrew Lester, whose door Yarl knocked on, in error. Yarl had come to pick up his younger brothers, who turned out to have been with friends at another house with a similar address. In rural upstate New York, 20-year-old Kaylin Gillis was shot and killed when she and her friends, having lost their way, drove up Kevin Monahan’s driveway. The car was turning around to leave when Monahan, 65, fired two bullets through the car window.</p><p>I live in the country. It’s easy to lose your way. Mailbox numbers flake off. Satellite signals vanish. Our packages have been delivered to the raccoons in the empty house down the road. I can’t count the times we’ve gotten lost en route to a friend’s, taken the wrong turns, stayed on the wrong dirt road until we could turn around. What would have happened if one of those driveways had belonged to Kevin Monahan, who, according to neighbors, had a “short fuse” and was enraged about trespassers?</p><p>Francine Prose is a former president of PEN American Center and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/19/why-are-americans-being-shot-for-knocking-on-the-wrong-door">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Anthony Comstock’s crusade against women gained him the moniker of ‘moral eunuch’. Today’s anti-choice zealots are following in his footsteps</p><p>Anthony Comstock thought that his fellow soldiers in the civil war talked about sex too much. When he signed up to serve for the Union in 1863, he saw soldiers behaving the way soldiers tend to do: they drank, and cursed, and made dirty jokes. This spectacle so scandalized Comstock’s Christian morality that he devoted the rest of his life – both in public crusades and in his position as inspector of the US Postal Service – to performing what he called “weeding in God’s garden”.</p><p>He rallied against women’s suffrage, secured the arrest and prosecution of his political enemies, and toured colleges and churches, giving speeches meant to whip his audience into a censorial frenzy. One of his targets, a New York abortion provider called Madame Restell, committed suicide after being entrapped and arrested by Comstock, who had posed as a husband seeking birth control pills. He sent others to jail for selling sex toys, or marketing abortion medications, or preaching free love. In short, Comstock became an anti-“obscenity” advocate: one of the most ideological and extreme enforcers of public morality in the nation’s history.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/19/comstock-act-censorship-anti-abortion-obscenity">Continue reading...</a>

## Free Money review – the great experiment of Universal Basic Income

<p>Documentary follows the ambiguous impact of an American non-profit’s grand largesse to a Kenyan village</p><p>From each, nothing according to ability; to each, a pretty decent amount regardless of need. This is the experiment in radical giving being carried out by the US non-profit organisation GiveDirectly and its perma-smiley co-founder Michael Faye. The group donates free money directly as universal basic income to villages and needy communities all over the world, without the costly admin of means testing. East Africa is the main focus, and this documentary tracks the group’s association with the Kenyan village of Kogutu, making monthly cash transfers beginning in 2017 to properly constituted adult residents there over a projected period of 12 years.</p><p>It sounds like the premise of a quirky British comedy like Local Hero or Whisky Galore!, only with money instead of whisky. The lucky lottery winners of Kogutu are delighted, of course, and no one in this film appears to be frittering the money away on booze or drugs, many are using it for home improvements and to help their families. Universal Basic Income is an idea whose time has, arguably, come. Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang in the US argues for it; in the UK and elsewhere, the Covid lockdown effectively showed that governments could do this, or something like it, in the form of furlough payments. And after all, state provision of facilities such as roads and bridges, used by rich and poor alike, shows that the principle is already there.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/19/free-money-review-the-great-experiment-of-universal-basic-income">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A day in the life of a mother and her newborn baby unfurls an investigation into how we find structure and meaning in the world – and in the novel </p><p>It’s useful for a critic to be met, every so often, with a novel that gently, determinedly, requests a purity of care from the person holding it. Kate Briggs’s debut work of fiction is one such novel.</p><p>It concerns many things: centrally, a spring day in the lives of Helen and her newborn baby, Rose, after a sleepless night. Their lack of rest affords two modes of attention within the book. Working solely on adrenaline to push through the next 12 hours of childcare, Helen becomes an ontological conduit for the reader, a means of sizing up why the ordinary proceedings of her life (making a cup of tea, taking a walk, reading a novel, putting Rose down on a play mat) should occur; why they have meaning.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/19/the-long-form-by-kate-briggs-review-motherhood-and-meaning">Continue reading...</a>

<p>She was a standout singer – but crumbled after a brutal marriage and backstreet abortion. Ahead of a new reissue, her peers recall what happened to this singular talent</p><p>The late British jazz singer George Melly used to ask his audiences: “Who is the greatest blues vocalist Britain has ever produced?” He’d tease them, asking, “Mick Jagger? No! Steve Winwood? No! Van Morrison? No!”, before suggesting the greatest of all time was Ottilie Patterson. Who?</p><p>County Down-born Patterson surely is the finest blues vocalist hailing from these damp isles. She was also an excellent jazz and folk singer, and her mellifluous voice can even be heard singing Shakespeare sonnets and baroque late-60s psychedelia. She blazed a trail that everyone from Dusty Springfield to Amy Winehouse has since followed; the Rolling Stones, Patterson said, “didn’t come out of a vacuum – we paved the way”. Her best recordings are exquisite: moody blues with swagger. Yet Patterson has been almost entirely forgotten, an unheralded pioneer. Thankfully, 2023 looks to be the year that she finally receives her due, with a new BBC documentary, My Name Is Ottilie, and a Record Store Day reissue of her 1969 album 3000 Years With Ottilie leading the way.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/19/ottilie-patterson-the-forgotten-first-lady-of-british-blues">Continue reading...</a>

Wheelchairs get lost and broken, people get left on planes for hours waiting for help to disembark, basic human dignities are disregarded. “What’s happening here is not a bunch of disgruntled holidaymakers whose luggage is lost,” she says. “It feels like an assault.” It doesn’t mean she didn’t wrestle with it as an issue: “Part of me thought, really, why are we campaigning for flights, when flying’s so bad anyway, in a climate crisis? When we’re in a cost of living crisis where disabled people are struggling to access anything, let alone holidays? But it does feel, when you’re us, like no one’s listening.” I get a flash of Morgan’s Loose Women persona – funny, knowing, redoubtable.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/19/the-trials-and-triumphs-of-sophie-morgan-at-18-i-had-my-hot-girl-summer-that-august-i-was-paralysed">Continue reading...</a>

<p>New research shows how species boost the amount of carbon stored in their ecosystems – and why protecting them is vital</p><p>What do elephants, otters and whales have in common? They all increase the amount of carbon that can be stored in their ecosystems. Elephants disperse seeds and trample low vegetation, enabling taller trees to grow. Sea otters eat sea urchins, allowing kelp to flourish. Whales feed at depth and release nutrients as they breathe and rest at the surface, stimulating phytoplankton production.</p><p>It isn’t just these three. We are beginning to learn that many species have complex effects on their environments that change the amount of carbon stored by their surrounding ecosystems – ultimately affecting climate change. When the population of wildebeest in the Serengeti plummeted due to disease, they no longer grazed as much, and the uneaten grass caused more frequent and more intense fires. Bringing back the numbers of wildebeest through disease management has meant fewer and smaller fires.

<p>A journalist’s account of the Arkansas town she left behind, and the friend whose fate she avoided</p><p>In 2015, Monica Potts reconnected with an old friend named Darci on Facebook. The two of them had grown up in Clinton, a small rural town on the edge of the Ozarks in Arkansas, and had been best friends in high school. In their teens, both vowed they would leave and build a life away from the dysfunction and deprivation of their home town, but for Darci it didn’t pan out like that. While Potts, who is now in her 40s, gained a scholarship to a college in Philadelphia, and became an award-winning political journalist (she has written for the New York Times and the Atlantic, and is now <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/monica-potts/" title="">senior politics reporter for FiveThirtyEight</a>), Darci failed to graduate high school and, like many in their social circle, never left Clinton. Over the years, Potts heard on the grapevine that Darci was struggling. When she finally visited her friend on Christmas Eve, 2015, she found her in crisis: separated from her two children, battling addiction, living in a trailer with a man she barely knew and stuck in a repetitive loop of jail time, release, decline and rearrest.</p><p>At the time, Potts was already investigating a disturbing trend: in 2012, a team of population health experts at the University of Illinois Chicago had found that white women who failed to graduate high school were dying five years earlier than the generation before them. Subsequent studies revealed a sustained fall in life expectancy among the least educated white American women, and an increase in so-called “deaths of despair”: drug overdoses, suicide and complications from alcoholism. Further research in 2018 by economists at Dartmouth College also revealed rising numbers of deaths from cancer, heart disease and respiratory illness among women below the poverty line. One of the researchers, Charlie Rafkin, told Potts that women suffered from a range of disadvantages, making it hard to pinpoint a single cause for the mortality increase. Instead he attributed it to a “general malaise”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/19/the-forgotten-girls-by-monica-potts-review-broken-heartlands">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Selectors have stuck with David Warner and their first-choice bowling attack but the question of reserves is where it gets interesting</p><p>Choosing Test cricket teams can be a fraught business. Competing claims and agendas create the conflict that makes selection a staple of reporting on the sport.

Aside from some tweaks for Asian tours, in the last couple of years the team sheet has been pro forma.</p><p>It is the same again for the upcoming World Test Championship final and Ashes campaign, according to the squad that covers the first three of those six Test matches in England across June and July. From those 17 names the first-choice XI is an easy pick. David Warner may be running out of road, but he and Steve Smith are still the batting mainstays, first-choice picks for a decade. Usman Khawaja’s late-career revival has made him indispensable as an opener.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/apr/19/australia-opt-against-rolling-the-dice-with-stability-key-to-ashes-squad-selection">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A comedy sketch writer’s crush on a pop star sparks this witty take on the Hollywood romcom</p><p>Have we reached a point where the novel should aspire to be like the best Hollywood romcoms? That’s the intriguing question that animates Curtis Sittenfeld’s Romantic Comedy. Sittenfeld is best known for her complex portrayals of first ladies in books that are more like tragedies in their probing of regret – 2020’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/24/rodham-by-curtis-sittenfeld-review-hill-minus-bill" title="">Rodham</a>, 2008’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/oct/12/fiction" title="">American Wife</a>. Here, she throws all the ingredients of 1930s Hollywood into modern America.</p><p>The book opens in New York in 2018. Sally is a confident, witty writer on the fictional equivalent of Saturday Night Live. She’s confronted by Noah, a hot pop star who’s guest-starring that week and wants her to help him refine the sketch he’s written. Huddled over her computer together, she’s surprised by how kind and thoughtful he is, and finds herself developing “a consuming, imbalance-inducing crush”. He’s so delighted by their collaborative sparring session that his concert that afternoon turns into a way of serenading her.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/19/romantic-comedy-by-curtis-sittenfeld-review-when-noah-met-sally">Continue reading...</a>

## Judy Blume Forever review – inspiring portrait of a fearless author

<p>As the author’s teen novels continue to aggravate the far right, this illuminating documentary spotlights her incredible career</p><p>What’s most astonishing about Judy Blume isn’t that her books keep selling 50 years after they burst onto the kids lit scene, but that they are no less potent than they were back then. With candid depictions of topics like menstruation, bullying and teen sex that is pleasurable rather than the fulcrum of a morality tale, Blume’s books still dominate summer camp cabins and school libraries daring enough not to ban them.</p><p>Deenie, a stunning 1973 novel about a girl whose scoliosis impinges on her mother’s dreams for her daughter’s modeling career, is the current favorite among the under-12 residents of this reviewer’s household. The same title, which also addresses masturbation with striking candor, aroused members of the far right. In a fabulous scene in Judy Blume Forever, Davina Pardo and Leah Wolchok’s documentary about the iconic writer, Blume is seen on the television show Crossfire sparring with conservative commentator Pat Buchanan in the early 1980s. The petite mother of two doesn’t lose her composure in the face of her critic’s prurient hang-ups. “Did you read the whole book or just the highlighted parts?” she asks in the warm tone of a cocktail party host offering hors d’oeuvres.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/18/judy-blume-forever-amazon-prime-review">Continue reading...</a>

For my 70th birthday, a friend held a secret fundraiser for a “trip of a lifetime” to a French music festival that I’d always wanted to attend.

The only flights available from Manchester are with Ryanair and its website said there were only four tickets left for the provisional festival dates in September. I therefore decided to book return flights for £120 and paid an extra £146 for the Flexi Plus service, which would allow me to amend the booking if the festival dates changed.

Lounging was certainly at the top of this townie’s list, until I was informed that guests on the 62-acre site in East Sussex are asked to contribute towards the maintenance and understanding of the woodland by joining a woodworking, woodblock printing or carving session, a tree walk or an outdoor qigong lesson.</p><p>I had George, my slightly reluctant 14-year-old son, in tow, so the idea of six hours patiently carving a spoon was never going to, erm, cut it. How about chopping logs into firewood with a bloody great axe? That sounded more like it, so we signed up for a 30-minute taster session. Two hours and buckets of sweat later, we had run out of logs. It was brilliant fun – the silent fall of the axe before the satisfying thwack as it meets the wood is at once exhilarating and meditative. (George loved it so much he’d reduced the pile of firewood logs in our cabin to kindling by the end of the weekend.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/apr/19/forest-cabin-in-east-sussex-where-visitors-contribute-to-their-stay">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In rousing new historical drama Chevalier, the story of Joseph Bologne, often crudely referred to as ‘Black Mozart’, is finally given the spotlight it deserves</p><p>It is the moment that Amadeus finally knows how Salieri felt. Strutting with arrogance, Mozart is challenged to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LtCIImfSCk">a violin duel</a> and upstaged by a precocious rival. His name? Joseph Bologne, AKA the Chevalier de Saint-Georges, AKA young, gifted and Black.</p><p>Whether this showdown ever took place is doubtful but it makes for a playful opening to <a href="https://www.chevalierfilm.com/">Chevalier</a>, a new film based on the life of the long-overlooked classical composer who was also a champion fencer, as devastating with the foil as the fiddlestick.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/19/chevalier-film-joseph-bologne-true-story">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A three-masted vessel adorns the city’s buildings and both teams’ crests. But is it an emblem of a crime against humanity?</p><p>I got my first Manchester City football badge when I was a little boy. It was gorgeous – a golden ship in full sail on the top half of the crest, the red rose of Lancashire on the bottom half, all framed in sky blue. The ship made a huge impression. It reminded me of the Blue Peter badge and pirates. Pirates were exciting. They did as they wanted, plundered what they fancied and ruled the waves. Everybody wanted a parrot on their shoulder and a patch on their eye.</p><p>With time, the badge became soaked in nostalgia. Golden ship – first match, Colin Bell, the smell of Bovril, cigarette smoke, frozen breath, Wembley 1976, <a href="https://www.mancity.com/news/club/man-city-dna-72-dennis-tueart-wembley-overhead-kick-63720476" title="">Dennis Tueart’s overhead</a>, the romance of winning the League Cup, even if it happened only once. The badge represented the City of my childhood. Over the decades, it changed. In the 1990s, <a href="https://1000logos.net/manchester-city-logo/" title="">a monstrous golden eagle</a> was introduced. It towered over the poor ship and had an unfortunate whiff of nazism about it. Thankfully, in 2016, the eagle was eradicated and the City badge returned to the reassuring certainties of the old days. The golden ship regained its prominence and the red rose returned.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/19/abandon-ship-does-this-symbol-of-slavery-shame-manchester-and-its-football-clubs">Continue reading...</a>

The various administrations since then have between them produced “at least 14 strategies, 689 policies and 10 targets, and at least 14 key institutions and agencies variously created and abolished”, according to a new report by the Institute for Government thinktank.</p><p>Despite all that, obesity has grown relentlessly as a problem for individuals, the NHS and the UK.</p><p>Health of the Nation white paper in 1992 was the first to set out a comprehensive role for government in preventing health problems, not just treating them.</p><p>Set a target to reduce the obese proportion of the population to 6% of men and 8% of women by 2005 – the first of many such targets that ministers have set since.</p><p>Created a 12-strong cabinet committee on public health. Argued for a new “national contract for health between the state, individuals and communities”. Set up the Health Development Agency, public health observatories and the Food Standards Agency. The latter issued advice about nutrition and tasked food producers with making their products healthier.</p><p>In 2004 agreed a target to halt the year-on-year rise in obesity in under-11s by 2010.</p><p>Banned advertising of unhealthy products on children’s TV, brought in the Healthy Start scheme and free fruit and vegetables for children aged between four and six. Set up the School Food Trust to advise on making school meals healthier.</p><p>Set a target of reducing the percentage of overweight and obese children to 2000 levels by 2020. Said that keeping to a healthy weight remained “the responsibility of individuals first”. Introduced the £75m Change4Life healthy eating campaign aimed at parents. Put £1.3bn into improving school food and school sport.</p><p>Launched a public health strategy. But austerity led to major cuts to the public health grant received by local councils and also to school sport and healthy eating programmes.</p><p>Through its responsibility deal, the coalition urged food manufacturers to do more to ensure their products contained less fat, salt and sugar.</p><p>Set up Public Health England to oversee improvement in public health, including obesity.</p><p>Announced in April 2016 the creation of the soft drinks industry levy – the “sugar tax” – as a way of prompting manufacturers to cut the amount of sugar in their products. Tax was introduced by Theresa May in 2018.</p><p>Published three childhood obesity strategies in three years. Set a “national ambition” to halve childhood obesity but did not specify a date. Michael Gove, May’s environment secretary, commissioned the Leon co-founder Henry Dimbleby to undertake a review of food policy, though few recommendations were acted on.</p><p>Prompted by a spell in intensive care with Covid-19 and his recognition of the links between obesity and the disease, Johnson in 2020 promised to introduce a raft of policies. They included restricting advertising of foods high in fat, salt or sugar (HFSS) on television before the 9pm watershed; limiting use of buy-one-get-one-free styled price promotions; and controlling where HFSS foods could be displayed in stores. However, only the last of those three policies has been implemented.

<p>Some species that grow where insects are scarce encourage animals to poo in their pitchers</p><p><br />Nepenthes carnivorous plants look like toilets, trapping insects and other small creatures in a bowl-shaped pitcher with an overhanging lid. But some species of nepenthes growing on mountains in Borneo have given up carnivory and instead encourage animals to poo in their pitchers.</p><p>This toilet habit was discovered when mountain tree shrews were found sitting on the enormous pitchers of nepenthes lowii, and as the shrews licked fatty food oozing from the lid of the pitcher they plopped their droppings inside. It was later found that rats, bats and a bird <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2009.0311">also made use of the plant toilets</a>.<br /><br />Other nepenthes species were also found collecting animal droppings, such as <em>Nepenthes hemsleyana</em><em>,</em> which even advertises itself to a particular species of bat using the shape of its pitchers to reflect the animal’s ultrasound calls. The pitchers <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982215006570">provide a special ridge for the bat to cling on to</a> while it relieves itself.<br /><br />All these plants grow on mountain peaks where insects are scarce, making carnivory very difficult. But the poo habit was found to be so nutritious it <a href="https://academic.oup.com/aob/article/130/7/927/6779531?login=false">gave these pitcher plants more than twice the nitrogen</a> of prey caught by carnivorous nepenthes plants.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/apr/19/nepenthes-lowii-carnivorous-plant-evolved-toilet-poo-animals-borneo">Continue reading...</a>
