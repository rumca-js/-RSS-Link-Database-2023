This hearing marked Fetterman's return from Walter Reed Medical Center where he underwent treatment for clinical depression the past two months. </p><p>His opening statement was quite painful to listen to. On account of his inability to speak. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>A staffer was seen holding up Fetterman's iPad as he talked to people after the hearing ended. As a result of the stroke he suffered in 2022, Fetterman has auditory processing issues - he can't hear voices clearly. According to the New York Times, the voices Fetterman hears <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/02/10/sen-john-fetterman-struggled-hearing-voices-after-stroke/" target="_blank">sound</a> similar to Charlie Brown's teacher in The Peanuts. The iPad has closed captioning abilities so he can read what is being said to him. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>The point here isn't to mock Fetterman for being a stroke victim or make fun of his disabilities. It's that this is painful to watch. It seems borderline abusive and very similar to the Jill/Joe Biden dynamic, where Jill leads Joe around on a leash while he clearly just wants to eat some ice cream at his beach house. During his hospitalization, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/gisele-fetterman-swimming-pool" target="_blank">Fetterman's wife Gisele</a> actually left the country with their children, reportedly to avoid intense media attention.  </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cNEW: Gisele Fetterman revealed on Friday that after her husband admitted himself into the hospital for severe depression, she took a road trip to Canada.\n\n"I did the first thing I could think of," she said.\n\nVia @ChuckRossDC \nhttps://t.co/CYgSDOAWNs\u201d</div> — Washington Free Beacon (@Washington Free Beacon)

</blockquote>

<p>You can't help but wonder if Fetterman would be better off taking some time to focus on his health and family before trying to lead the state of Pennsylvania as a Senator. Gisele actually spoke on this point in an August <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVZ54a0K3a0" target="_blank">interview</a>, explaining she's never considered asking her husband to quit for health purposes, since doctors told them he'll make a full recovery.  She also said she saved his life and will "never let him forget that". Which is...nice...I guess? </p><p>Whether a "full recovery" is on the horizon remains to be seen. But it's really tough to watch as his deteriorating health is on full display. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Watch as woman unloads an entire shopping cart worth of stolen meat and only one person tries to stop her

## WATCH: Crowder Exposes Long History Of Sexual Abuse And Exploitation In The United Nations

They aren't even trying to hide it any more. </p><p>Crowder set the stage by playing a clip from Monday of the UN Secretary General lecturing the assemble on indigenous rights. Crowder then contrasted this with the organization's March report that publicly supports pedophilia, and emphasized that this should, perhaps, be a bigger priority than indigenous rights. </p><p>Crowder read the proposal that states, "sexual conduct involving persons below the domestically prescribed minimum age of consent to sex may be consensual in fact, if not in law. In this context, the enforcement of criminal law should reflect the rights and capacity of persons under 18 years of age to make decisions of engaging in consensual sexual conduct."</p><p>Gerald highlighted how they didn't even put a "floor" in the proposal - meaning, there's no minimum age of consent. Crowder explained how this cannot be an accident, but shouldn't come as a surprise, given that the UN has a decades-long history of sexual assault and human trafficking. Crowder played a clip of Jane Holl Lute, the former Obama Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security and current UN envoy on the Cyprus dispute, as she explained the deep-seated problem of sexual exploitation and abuse in the UN, and how it particularly plagues humanitarian operations. Crowder then brought up Nikki Haley's comments on the matter as recently as 2017, and explained that the UN doesn't know the exact number of sexual abuse cases. </p><p>Crowder and crew continued to go through the detailed  timeline of sexual abuse in the UN. They also explained Fox News' settlement with Dominion, and rampant crime in New York City - so be sure to tune in for the full show exclusively on Rumble. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rumble">

## 'They Said They're Gonna Kill Us': Chicago Couple Details Completely Random Mob Attack, No Help From Police

A young couple who got <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/04/19/mob-randomly-attacks-couple-walking-in-chicago-they-said-they-were-going-to-kill-us/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=nypost" target="_blank">caught up in the mob</a> detailed their terrifying experience during the unprovoked attack. Twenty-year-old Ashley Knutson and 22-year-old Devontae Garrisson-Johnson were outside of a Macy's when they were suddenly overrun by the mob of teens. One of them shoved Ashley, and Devontae told them not to do that. Then the mob threatened to kill them. </p><p>Ashley was pushed to the ground as the entire mob descended on her boyfriend. In the video of the attack, Ashley can be heard pleading for help until a bystander intervenes to deescalate the situation. That bystander, Lenora Dennis, told <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/everything-went-crazy-couple-assaulted-in-chicago-loop-saturday-tells-harrowing-story/3122157/" target="_blank">NBC Chicago</a> she felt she needed to step in since Devontae was bleeding out of his mouth, head, and eyes and couldn't make eye contact. So I'd say she made a fair assessment. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>But Ashley said cops driving by acted like they didn't see anything. Even as her boyfriend was bleeding out of his eyes. Dennis also found no help from the Chicago PD: "I literally went out in the street and held my hands up to a police car and asked them to stop and motioned them over to what was going on, and they just cut a path around me and just kept going."</p><p>Dennis actually drove the couple to a police station to file a report, and the desk sergeant told her things like this were going to keep happening because of the new Mayor, Brandon Johnson. Yesterday, Johnson urged the public not to "demonize" the violent mobs of teens, while former Mayor <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lori-lightfoot-chicago-reelection" target="_blank">Lori Lightfoot </a>blamed the rampage on the nice weather. And no arrests have been made in connection with this attack. </p><p>Pray for Chicago. They definitely need it. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

</p><p>This is where Lil' Timmy got involved. Upon seeing his mother eating fists, he was inspired by his Batman shirt and lept into action. Hitting the other mommy with what appears to be a bottle of conditioner. Of course, had Batman done something to save his mommy he wouldn't be Batman. But this junior crimefighter wasn't going to leave his mother to fend for herself. He better have been taken to the bike aisle after this as a reward.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

Without having all the details and context available, I'm going to call this a gross overreaction to a baby crying on an airplane.</p><p>A gross HILARIOUS overreaction to a baby.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">The crying baby (which sounds more like a toddler than a baby-baby) magically stops crying halfway through this man’s rant which leads me to believe the people they were traveling with could’ve done more to meet whatever need they were expressing. <br /><br />40-45 minutes is excessive. <a href="https://t.co/af2xsIDF3g">pic.twitter.com/af2xsIDF3g</a><br />— I ❤️ Jews, Please dont close my accounts.

<p>There are worst thing to happen on a plane than a crying baby for (allegedly) forty-five minutes. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/break-up-mid-flight" target="_blank">People have been dumped on a plane</a>. A dude <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/man-masturbates-repeatedly-southwest-flight" target="_blank">masturbated FOUR TIMES on a short flight</a>. That's three times more than one and four times more than appropriate. Just sayin', the flight could have been more problematic.</p><p>I don't know who I feel worse for. The dude's wife who had her Florida vacation ruined? Or everyone else from the moment the dude deboarded to the Uber driver on the way home. There is not a single person this man walked past who did not hear about that goddamned motherf*cker crying on the airplane.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

Really, all Anheuser-Busch products. A -- *ahem* -- <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-staffer-under-bus" target="_blank">"low-level staffer's" political agenda</a> has cost the company billions and billions in market cap. Patriots and real Americans sick of watching companies pander to wokeness have drawn a line in the sand and decided to make an example out of Bud Light. It brings a tear to your eye.</p><p>But while boycotts are cool (buycotts of other beer is better) don't be the guy smashing cases of Busch Light in the aisle of a Walmart.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Topeka, Kansas <a href="https://t.co/VU3EnpmSPH">pic.twitter.com/VU3EnpmSPH</a><br />— Clown World ™ 🤡 (@ClownWorld_) <a href="https://twitter.com/ClownWorld_/status/1648523414490198017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 19, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Did someone say "Topeka?"</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>To recap how we got here, Bud Light, looking for an ESG boost, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/james-okeefe-dylan-mulvaney" target="_self">announced a brand ambassadorship with titface performer Dylan Mulvaney</a>. There were boycotts. AB <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/anheuser-busch-ceo-statement" target="_self">attempted an apology at the end of the day on Friday</a> when they didn't think anyone would notice. THEN they thought <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/budweiser-conservative-ad" target="_blank">a NEW ad with the American Flag and horses</a> would shut up their now former flyover country fanbase. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-brantley-gilbert" target="_blank">It did not</a>.</p><p>Here's the thing. Boycotts are good. Peaceful protesting is good. When your actions start to resemble vegans crying over spilled milk in the dairy aisle, you wanna dial it back a bit.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Radical environmentalists in Scotland empty bottles of milk in "peaceful protest" against dairy industry. <a href="https://t.co/HWjerXS6RK">pic.twitter.com/HWjerXS6RK</a><br />— The Post Millennial (@TPostMillennial) <a href="https://twitter.com/TPostMillennial/status/1581306384544829445?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>There are better ways to express your disapproval of the product in public without committing a misdemeanor. Ways that allow you to get your point across in both an informative and hilarious way. Four words:</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">“For rectal use only” <a href="https://t.co/2qax8FTA2H">pic.twitter.com/2qax8FTA2H</a><br />— Old Row (@OldRowOfficial) <a href="https://twitter.com/OldRowOfficial/status/1647794634079473669?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 17, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>There are effective ways to boycott Anheuser Busch and there are ineffective ways. It pains me to say this dude falls into the later category.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
