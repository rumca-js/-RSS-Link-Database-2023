[{"source": "https://www.jefftk.com/news.rss", "title": "GWWC Reporting Attrition Visualization", "description": "<p><span>\n\nA few weeks ago </span>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\">Giving What\nWe Can</a> published their \n\n<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EipE75vsDuD7bdJar/\">impact\nevaluation</a>.  As an organization that supports people in making\nlong term altruistic commitments, the question of how much people\nstick to those commitments is pretty important.  We don't know what\npeople are actually doing, but whether they're reporting donations to\nGWWC is a decent proxy, and the evaluation includes a table of how\nmany members were still reporting donations:\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/proportion-of-gwwc-pledgers-reporting-any-donations-table-big.png\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"406\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/proportion-of-gwwc-pledgers-reporting-any-donations-table.png\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThis is interesting data, but I found it a bit hard to think about.  I\ntried a few ways of visualizing it, and made a pair of charts:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/gwwc-recording-by-cohort-big.png\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"413\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/gwwc-recording-by-cohort.png\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/gwwc-recording-decay-by-cohort-big.png\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"413\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/gwwc-recording-decay-by-cohort.png\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<i><a href=\"https://github.com/jeffkaufman/gwwc-recording-decay\">code</a></i>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nI colored each line with an intensity proportional to the number of\npeople in the cohort, since that represents how much information it\nrepresents.  The weighted average line fades out over time as it\nrepresents progressively fewer members.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nSome thoughts, looking at the charts:\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p>Later cohorts, starting around 2015, fall off faster than\nearlier cohorts.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>Reporting attrition is quite sharp at first, and then slows\ndown, but it doesn't go to zero.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>After the initial attrition it seems to end up around 2-6%\nannually, though this depends a lot on where you see \"initial\nattrition\" ending.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>There's probably some sort of effect of the calendar year (\"how\nhard did GWWC push people to report donations\") and I haven't looked\nat this.\n\n\n</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n<i>Disclosure: <a href=\"https://juliawise.net/\">my wife</a> used to be\nPresident of GWWC.
