A few weeks ago </span>

<a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/">Giving What
We Can</a> published their 

<a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EipE75vsDuD7bdJar/">impact
evaluation</a>.  As an organization that supports people in making
long term altruistic commitments, the question of how much people
stick to those commitments is pretty important.  We don't know what
people are actually doing, but whether they're reporting donations to
GWWC is a decent proxy, and the evaluation includes a table of how
many members were still reporting donations:

This is interesting data, but I found it a bit hard to think about.  I
tried a few ways of visualizing it, and made a pair of charts:

</p>

I colored each line with an intensity proportional to the number of
people in the cohort, since that represents how much information it
represents.  The weighted average line fades out over time as it
represents progressively fewer members.

</p>

<p>

Some thoughts, looking at the charts:

</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Later cohorts, starting around 2015, fall off faster than
earlier cohorts.

</p></li>
<li><p>Reporting attrition is quite sharp at first, and then slows
down, but it doesn't go to zero.

</p></li>
<li><p>After the initial attrition it seems to end up around 2-6%
annually, though this depends a lot on where you see "initial
attrition" ending.

</p></li>
<li><p>There's probably some sort of effect of the calendar year ("how
hard did GWWC push people to report donations") and I haven't looked
at this.


</p></li>
</ul>
