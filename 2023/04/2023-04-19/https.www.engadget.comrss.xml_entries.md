## Comixology’s Marvel Comics app is shutting down in June

<p>Marvel <a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/marvel-comics-app-purchases-moving-to-marvel-unlimited">announced</a> today that its Comixology-operated Marvel Comics app is shutting down this June. Fortunately, comic fans who bought issues in the app can access them in the company’s self-operated <a href="https://www.engadget.com/marvel-unlimited-comics-app-redesign-140052400.html">Marvel Unlimited app</a>. The shutdown comes several months after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-air-drone-delivery-lay-offs-192841878.html">layoffs at Amazon</a> (Comixology’s owner <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-04-10-amazon-buys-comixology.html">since 2014</a>) reportedly hit the comic storefront especially hard.</p><p>The Marvel Comics app will shut down on June 2nd. Exactly one month before that — May 2nd — is the cutoff date for new purchases in the old app. Any purchases made up to that date will transfer to Marvel Unlimited.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Android users who bought digital comics through the Comixology Marvel Comics app have an effortless transition: do nothing, and your comics should appear in Marvel Unlimited. (That’s because the Android app already required a Marvel account.) But iOS users have a few extra steps. First, you’ll need to open the Comixology Marvel Comics app on your iPhone or iPad. Then, <a href="https://help.marvel.com/hc/en-us/articles/14679582837019-I-don-t-have-a-Marvel-accou[&#x002026;]can-I-create-one-and-link-my-digital-comic-purchases-redeems-">follow Marvel’s instructions</a> to link a Marvel account to the old app. After that, your old purchases should appear in Marvel Unlimited.</p><p>You won’t need a Marvel Unlimited subscription to access your purchases from the old app. But to entice you to buy into its service, Marvel is offering a discounted price of $5 per month for the first year with coupon code UNLIMITED. (It’s usually $10 / month or $70 if you pay for an entire year.) Marvel Unlimited is like Netflix for Marvel comics, offering access to over 30,000 issues from the Marvel universe. Like the Comixology-run app, there’s usually a delay of around three months between an issue’s initial release and its availability on the subscription platform.</p><p>Although Marvel has apparently gone out of its way to make this transition relatively smooth, it still illustrates the potential for chaos when digital content shifts platforms. We don’t own any of this stuff, so when parent companies <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-announces-comixology-fixes-195615846.html">mismanage apps</a>, lay off workers and shuffle priorities, we’re left to hope mega-corporations want to do right by their customers — a trust factor worth bearing in mind any time you buy a comic, game or any other digital media.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/comixologys-marvel-comics-app-is-shutting-down-in-june-185006909.html?src=rss

## Copyright in spotlight after streaming platforms pull AI-generated Drake song

<p>If you spent almost any time on the internet this week, you probably saw a lot of chatter about “Heart on My Sleeve.” The song went viral for featuring AI-generated voices that do a pretty good job of mimicking Drake and The Weeknd singing about a recent breakup.</p><div id="14bef30b69a041d38e5f44d0c3dd4c58"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Listen to this AI generated song featuring Drake &amp; The Weeknd.<br /><br />It goes so damn hard.<br /><br />It's by &quot;Ghostwriter977&quot; on TikTok and it's blowing up on socials + streaming platforms.<br /><br />UMG, which controls around 1/3 of the global music market, has already asked streaming platforms to ban… <a href="https://t.co/roz2EfI48M">pic.twitter.com/roz2EfI48M</a></p>— Roberto Nickson (@rpnickson) <a href="https://twitter.com/rpnickson/status/1647548141384736770?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 16, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>On Monday, Apple Music and Spotify pulled the track following a complaint from Universal Music Group, the label that represents the real-life versions of the two Toronto-born artists. A day later, YouTube, Amazon, SoundCloud, Tidal, Deezer and TikTok did the same.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At least, they tried to comply with the complaint, but as is always the case with the internet, you can still find the song on websites like YouTube. Before it was removed from Spotify, “Heart on My Sleeve” was a bonafide hit. People streamed the track more than 600,000 times. On TikTok, where the creator of the song, the aptly named Ghostwriter977, first uploaded it, users listened to “Heart on My Sleeve” more than 15 million times.</p><p>In a statement Universal Music Group shared with publications like <a href="https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/universal-music-group-responds-to-fake-drake-ai-track-streaming-platforms-have-a-fundamental-responsibility/"><em>Music Business Worldwide</em></a>, the label argued the training of a generative AI using the voices of Drake and The Weeknd was “a breach of our agreements and a violation of copyright law.&quot; The company added that streaming platforms had a &quot;legal and ethical responsibility to prevent the use of their services in ways that harm artists.&quot;</p><p>It’s fair to say the music industry, much like the rest of society, now finds itself at an inflection point over the use of AI. While there are obvious ethical issues related to the creation of “Heart on My Sleeve,” it’s unclear if it’s a violation of traditional copyright law. In March, the US Copyright Office <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ai-generated-images-from-text-cant-be-copyrighted-us-government-rules-174243933.html">said</a> art, including music, cannot be copyrighted if it was produced by providing a text prompt to a generative AI model. However, the office left the door open to granting copyright protections to works with AI-generated elements.</p><p>“The answer will depend on the circumstances, particularly how the AI tool operates and how it was used to create the final work,&quot; <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2023-03-16/pdf/2023-05321.pdf">it said</a>. &quot;This is necessarily a case-by-case inquiry. If a work’s traditional elements of authorship were produced by a machine, the work lacks human authorship and the Office will not register it.&quot; In the case of “Heart on My Sleeve,” complicating matters is that the song was written by a human being. It’s impossible to say how a court challenge would play out. What is clear is that we’re only the start of a very long discussion about the role of AI in music.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/copyright-in-spotlight-after-streaming-platforms-pull-ai-generated-drake-song-183513972.html?src=rss

## ‘Star Trek: Strange New Worlds’ first season 2 trailer promises Klingons and Kirk

<p><em>Star Trek: Picard</em> heads out to pasture when the series finale airs this week. We live in an age of shared universes, however, so another Trek is coming quicker than you can say raktajino (Klingon coffee). The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-110-a-quality-of-mercy-review-130037849.html">second season of the well-reviewed</a><em>Star Trek: Strange New Worlds</em> premieres on June 15th, and Paramount+ has <a href="https://www.paramountpressexpress.com/paramount-plus/shows/star-trek-strange-new-worlds/releases/?view=105074-paramount-reveals-teaser-trailer-for-star-trek-strange-new-worlds-season-two">finally dropped a real trailer.</a></p><p>We’ve known the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-season-2-premieres-june-15th-210101079.html">premiere date for a while</a>, but there was no trailer until now, which is an odd choice considering the show starts in less than two months. Still, the footage gives a fairly in-depth look at what the Enterprise will be up to in June, and there is a lot for fans to get excited about. Eagle-eyed viewers will notice the return of regular-looking Klingons, so it looks like the vaguely off-putting redesign featured in <em>Star Trek: Discovery</em> is over and done with.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="ee4fdffe62b6468c91c719cba00ae50a"></div><p>There is also plenty of Captain Kirk, as played by newcomer Paul Wesley. Kirk appeared twice during the first season and was heavily involved in the season finale. Remember, <em>Strange New Worlds</em> is a prequel that chronicles the adventures of the Enterprise before Captain Kirk, so this is a younger version of the character.</p><p>The show also features younger versions of other legacy characters like Spock and Uhura, along with minor characters from the original 1960s <em>Star Trek</em>, such as Nurse Chapel and Dr. M’benga. <em>Strange New Worlds</em> strives to captures the feel of older Trek shows, with a return to the episodic formula that made the franchise such a hit in the first place.</p><p>This has been a big couple of weeks for Trek-related announcements. Yesterday saw the official announcement of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/paramount-greenlights-star-trek-film-starring-michelle-yeoh-164630152.html">Michelle Yeoh-led movie</a> and last month Paramount+ <a href="https://www.engadget.com/paramount-orders-new-star-trek-series-set-at-starfleet-academy-183059826.html">revealed a forthcoming show</a> set at Starfleet Academy. <em>Strange New Worlds</em> has also already been renewed for a third season. In other words, the franchise is, uh, prospering.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-first-season-2-trailer-promises-klingons-and-kirk-181406000.html?src=rss

## Snapchat is expanding ChatGPT-powered ‘My AI’ service to all users

<p>Snapchat’s ChatGPT-powered AI personality <a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/sps-2023-whats-next-for-my-ai">is expanding </a>to all the app’s users. An upgraded version of “My AI,” the in-app chatbot that was previously <a href="https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-adds-openai-powered-chatbot-and-proactively-apologizes-for-what-it-might-say-180507261.html">limited to</a> Snapchat+ subscribers, is now launching globally, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel announced at the company’s Partner Summit event.</p><p>With the expansion, My AI has a number of new Snapchat-specific features. It can provide Snapchat users with recommendations for restaurants and other activities based on what’s popular in the Snap Map, and can suggest augmented reality lenses. Users can also add the AI to group chats, and set a custom name and avatar (via Bitmoji) for the AI persona. My AI is also now able to respond to photo and video snaps. For now, it can only respond with text messages, but Snap says that “soon” it will be able to respond to snaps with its own AI-generated art. (That feature will, however, be exclusive to Snapchat+.)</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While My AI’s rollout has been limited until now, the company says that My AI has already been a hit with users, who exchange 2 million messages a day with the bot. Snap’s implementation of OpenAI’s technology has also been criticized, though. <em>The Washington Post </em>reported that the bot engaged in inappropriate conversations and gave <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/03/14/snapchat-myai/">questionable advice</a> to researchers posing as teens.</p><p>Now, Snap says that My AI uses “additional moderation technology” so that users’ can be temporarily restricted from the feature if they “misuse the service.” The company also says the AI has been trained to consider the age of the user it’s messaging with to help prevent chats from veering into unsafe territory. Additionally, parents will eventually be able to use the app’s parental control feature, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-family-center-040146796.html">Family Center</a>, to track how much time their teens are spending chatting with their new AI friend.</p><p>Even so, Snap seems to be well-aware of the limitations of My AI, which it has previously described as “prone to hallucination.” Even Spiegel, who has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/27/23614959/snapchat-my-ai-chatbot-chatgpt-openai-plus-subscription">suggested</a> that interacting with AI like ChatGPT will soon be an everyday activity, was somewhat cautious in his endorsement “My AI certainly makes plenty of mistakes, so you can’t rely on it for advice, but it’s definitely entertaining,” he said.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-is-expanding-chatgpt-powered-my-ai-service-to-all-users-180017142.html?src=rss

## Drones may better navigate unfamiliar surroundings with the help of liquid neural networks

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/drones/">Drones</a> have a wide range of applications, but sending them into unfamiliar environments can be a challenge. Whether <a href="https://www.engadget.com/alphabets-wing-drone-delivery-service-comes-to-texas-on-april-7th-120059178.html">delivering a package</a>, monitoring wildlife or conducting search and rescue missions, knowing how to navigate previously unseen surroundings (or ones that have changed significantly) is critical for a drone to effectively complete tasks. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) believe they've found a more effective way of helping drones fly through unknown spaces, thanks to liquid neural networks.</p><p>MIT <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mit-century-old-differential-equation-liquid-ai-computational-bottleneck-160035555.html">created its liquid neural networks</a> — which are inspired by the adaptability of organic brains — in 2021. The artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms are able to learn and adapt to new data in the real world, not only while they're being trained. They can think on the fly, in other words.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>They're able to understand information that's critical to a drone's task while dismissing irrelevant features of an environment, the researchers note. The liquid neural nets can also &quot;dynamically capture the true cause-and-effect of their given task,&quot; according to a paper published in <em>Science Robotics. </em>This is &quot;the key to liquid networks’ robust performance under distribution shifts.&quot;</p><div id="43c05141a5d04238b60cdf996db50f52"></div><p>The liquid neural nets outperformed other approaches to navigation tasks, the researchers noted in the paper. The algorithms &quot;showed prowess in making reliable decisions in unknown domains like forests, urban landscapes and environments with added noise, rotation and occlusion,&quot; the university said in a press release.</p><p>MIT points out that deep learning systems can flounder when it comes to understanding causality and can't always adapt to different environments or conditions. That poses a problem for drones, which have to be able to react quickly to obstacles.</p><p>&quot;Our experiments demonstrate that we can effectively teach a drone to locate an object in a forest during summer, and then deploy the model in winter, with vastly different surroundings, or even in urban settings with varied tasks such as seeking and following,” Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) director, MIT professor and paper co-author Daniela Rus said in a statement. “This adaptability is made possible by the causal underpinnings of our solutions. These flexible algorithms could one day aid in decision-making based on data streams that change over time, such as medical diagnosis and autonomous driving applications.&quot;</p><p>The researchers trained their system on data captured by a human pilot. This enabled them to account for the pilot's ability to use their navigation skills in new environments that have undergone significant changes in conditions and scenery. In testing the liquid neural nets, the researchers found that drones were able to track moving targets, for instance. They suggest that marrying limited data from expert sources with an improved ability to understand new environments could make drone operations more reliable and efficient.</p><p>“Robust learning and performance in out-of-distribution tasks and scenarios are some of the key problems that machine learning and autonomous robotic systems have to conquer to make further inroads in society critical applications,” says Alessio Lomuscio, PhD, professor of AI Safety (in the Department of Computing) at Imperial College London. “In this context the performance of liquid neural networks, a novel brain-inspired paradigm developed by the authors at MIT, reported in this study is remarkable.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/drones-may-better-navigate-unfamiliar-surroundings-with-the-help-of-liquid-neural-networks-180015474.html?src=rss

## Google Fi adds a one-week eSIM trial and 'Wireless' to its name

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google-fi/"><ins>Google Fi</ins></a> has announced a series of updates, including a change to its name. From now on, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-26-best-mvnos.html"><ins>mobile virtual network operator</ins></a> will be known as Google Fi Wireless. While that's not quite as snappy, it should be clearer to consumers what the service actually is.</p><p>If you have an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-fi-iphone-esim-support-224937093.html"><ins>eSIM-compatible device</ins></a>, you'll be able to test out Google Fi Wireless at no cost. That's because there's <a href="https://fi.google.com/about/free-trial">a seven-day free trial</a>. Google started <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-fi-esim-7-day-free-trial/"><ins>testing the trial</ins></a> last month and it's now available more broadly. If you don't cancel the Google Fi Wireless trial within a week, you'll join the Simply Unlimited plan (which you'll still be able to quit at any time).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Other providers already offer eSIM trials, including Verizon (which has a 30-day trial) and T-Mobile, which offers potential customers the chance to try its network for three months at no cost. T-Mobile's network powers Google Fi Wireless, but the latter will hope that its bells and whistles will lure folks to that service.</p><p>The Simply Unlimited plan costs as little as $20 per user per month, depending on how many people are included. It offers unlimited data (throttled after 35GB), calls and texts in the US, Canada and Mexico, along with spam call blocking, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-fi-iphone-now-available-212215291.html"><ins>a VPN</ins></a> and 5GB of tethered data. Google Fi Wireless is sweetening the deal further, as the plan now includes cellular connectivity for certain smartwatches at no extra cost.&nbsp;</p><p>The service already included Pixel Watch connectivity on the Flexible and Unlimited Plus plans. That device is now supported on the Simply Unlimited plan as well. Moreover, Google Fi Wireless has also started offering Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 and Watch 5 Pro connectivity on all three plans.&nbsp;</p><p>Elsewhere, Google is offering a phone at no cost for every new line that's added to any plan, as long as you make a 24-month commitment. You can snag a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6a-review-battery-life-camera-samples-170025138.html">Google Pixel 6a</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-a53-announced-specs-availability-pricing-ces-2023-150011687.html">Samsung A14</a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2022-motorola-moto-g-power-140010550.html">Moto G Power</a> through this offer, which is based on bill credits.</p><p>As part of Google Fi Wireless' mission to recenter the service around families, it's rolling out a redesign of the namesake app starting today. It'll be easier for parents and guardians to manage safety settings, Google says. Among the options are to only allow trusted numbers to call or text a child's device. The app will also offer the ability to manage your Google Fi Wireless plan and add new members.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-fi-adds-a-one-week-esim-trial-and-wireless-to-its-name-173024702.html?src=rss

## Snapchat is expanding its revenue sharing program to entice creators

<p>Snap, once happy to let creators take a backseat to users’ friends and family, is making a <a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/sps-2023-new-programs-and-features-for-creators">new push</a> to bring more creators onto its platform. The app is expanding its revenue sharing program and adding new public-facing features to help creators get started and get discovered in the app.</p><p>Snapchat first introduced mid-roll ads as a way for some of its Snap Stars to earn money from their Stories <a href="https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-tests-mid-roll-ads-220025784.html">last year</a>. Now, the company says that creators with at least 50,000 followers, 25 million monthly views and at least 10 Stories posts a month “may be eligible” to participate in the revenue-sharing arrangement. Presumably, the company is still reserving the right to greenlight individual users into the program, but the metrics at least give budding creators a target to shoot for.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The program isn’t the only way creators can earn money from Snap, but sharing in ad revenue has long been top creators’ <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-stars-creator-fund-payouts-222006327.html">preferred</a> way to get paid as it tends to be the most reliable. The company also has a music-focused <a href="https://snap.com/en-US/terms/sounds-creator-fund-terms">creator fund</a> and pays users for popular <a href="https://creators.snap.com/learn-reap-rewards-how-to-get-rewarded-on-spotlight">Spotlight</a> content.</p><figure><img alt="Snapchat's new Public Profiles." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/f8287a70-de6c-11ed-bedf-b569c0ed0025" style="height: 540px; width: 960px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Snap</div></figure><p>For those who aren’t yet getting views in the millions, Snap is also adding new public-facing profiles and Stories, which will be available to any user over the age of 18. The changes allow users to share both private “friend” content and publicly viewable Stories from the same account, along with analytics and other metrics. As Snap notes, this gives users a pathway to becoming a more prolific creator even if they aren't yet eligible to become a <a href="https://help.snapchat.com/hc/en-us/articles/7012407611412-How-do-I-become-a-Snap-Star-">Snap Star</a>. Users can also save Stories posts and specific snaps to their public profile, the first time the app has enabled non-ephemeral snaps and Stories.</p><p>The features are also one of the most notable ways that Snap has blurred the lines between public content and friend content. The company has long <a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/celebrating-our-real-friends">bragged</a> about its origins as a messaging app for <a href="http://html/">“real friends”</a> and said that disappearing messages reduce the kinds of social pressure often associated with its rivals. But those constraints aren’t necessarily conducive to successful — or well paid — creators. Now Snap is trying to find a ways to make both possible.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-is-expanding-its-revenue-sharing-program-to-entice-creators-173023251.html?src=rss

## Snapchat+ already has 3 million subscribers

<p>Snapchat's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-is-a-new-subscription-service-for-power-users-125633027.html">subscription service</a> may be more popular than you think. Snap has revealed that Snapchat+ has topped 3 million subscribers. That suggests growth is once again accelerating. While growth slowed after the 1 million mark in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-plus-summer-drop-priority-replies-151002513.html">first month</a>, it reached 2 million users <a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/snapchatplus-twomillion">in January</a> — there's clearly an audience willing to pay $4 per month for early features and VIP benefits like priority comments.</p><p>The social network is also adding a few new features for everyone. A new &quot;After Dark&quot; shared Story lets friends add to a summary of late-night escapades. A Communities feature for sharing views with classmates, meanwhile, is expanding to more schools over the course of the month.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Snap Map will be more useful as well. You'll see 3D landmarks that could help you find content around hotspots, while location sharing helps you keep track of pals. Places can also have tags to help you find trending venues.</p><p>The Snapchat+ expansion and new features come at a crucial moment. Snapchat has continued to grow, reaching <a href="https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-now-has-more-than-750-million-monthly-active-users-210037334.html">750 million monthly active users</a> (and 375 million daily users) as of February despite competition from the likes of Instagram and TikTok. It also follows after a rough 2022 that included <a href="https://www.engadget.com/snap-layoffs-confirmed-hardware-games-mini-apps-182149943.html">layoffs of 1,300 workers</a> and the early <a href="https://www.engadget.com/snap-pixy-selfie-drone-development-end-172809304.html">death of its Pixy selfie drone</a>. Sustained growth could not only help Snap bounce back, but help reduce its dependence on ad money.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-already-has-3-million-subscribers-172021014.html?src=rss

<p>Following years of litigation over the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mark-zuckerberg-misled-congress-sec-docs-183809371.html"><ins>Cambridge Analytica scandal</ins></a>, a federal judge recently gave initial approval to a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.327471/gov.uscourts.cand.327471.1130.0_1.pdf"><ins>$725 million settlement</ins></a> between Meta and Facebook users alleging the company shared their personal data without proper consent. If you used Facebook between May 2007 and December 2022 and lived in the US during that time, you’re eligible to get cash from the settlement. While it will be a few more months before that money starts making its way to people, you don’t need to wait to submit a claim.</p><p>You can start the process by visiting the <a href="https://facebookuserprivacysettlement.com/">settlement website</a> and clicking or tapping the “<a href="https://facebookuserprivacysettlement.com/#submit-claim"><ins>Submit Claim</ins></a>” button at the top of the page. There’s a full set of instructions on the page, but the short version of what you need to do is provide your contact information and the email, phone number or username associated with your Facebook account. If you have more than one account, file for the one you’ve had the longest.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You also need to complete an eligibility check, which involves stating whether you lived in the US between May 24th, 2007 and December 22nd, 2022, and if you were a Facebook user over that same time period. Lastly, you need to sign the form and indicate how you would like to be paid. Venmo and PayPal are options if you don’t want to share your bank information.</p><p>The deadline to submit an online claim is August 25th, 2023 at 11:59PM PT. You can also submit a claim by mail, provided it’s postmarked by August 25th, 2023. After completing the form, make sure all the information is accurate. Note that you can only submit one claim.</p><p>If you have questions about the process, you can contact the settlement administration by emailing info@facebookuserprivacysettlement.com or calling 1-855-566-2233. One last thing, the claim form recommends adding “confirmation@facebookuserprivacysettlement.com” to your contact list to ensure any important correspondence doesn’t end up in your spam folder.</p><p>How much you can expect to receive from the settlement will depend on how many people submit valid claims, and how long you were a Facebook user during the eligibility period. If every person who can apply does, you’re looking at a payout of at most a few dollars. The final approval hearing is scheduled for September 7th. Payments should be mailed out after the court grants final approval and any appeals are sorted out.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/heres-how-to-claim-your-cut-of-metas-725-million-cambridge-analytica-class-action-settlement-163255438.html?src=rss

<p>Lego has already gone to the Sonic the Hedgehog well for a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lego-sonic-the-hedgehog-release-date-price-193034341.html"><ins>nifty recreation of the original game’s</ins></a> iconic Green Hill Zone, but now the toy brick company is preparing even more Sonic-inspired play sets. Even cooler for true-blue fans? One set is built around speed, a concept the zippy hedgehog is intimately familiar with.</p><p>Sonic’s Speed Sphere Challenge ships with <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=70bceed8-b1ae-4af0-9fde-faa9258e1bc8&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=LEGO&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI3MGJjZWVkOC1iMWFlLTRhZjAtOWZkZS1mYWE5MjU4ZTFiYzgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGVnby5jb20vZW4tdXMvYWJvdXR1cy9uZXdzLzIwMjMvYXByaWwvbGVnby1zb25pYy10aGUtaGVkZ2Vob2ciLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjVkYmI1MDU1LTQ2MzYtNDM0My05OTZmLTkxMmE5OTAyZTZmMCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAR4t2DY1-ZWFgbY-VKfVUX-j-QWv2rcsh2TXQEcjsCWp&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Faboutus%2Fnews%2F2023%2Fapril%2Flego-sonic-the-hedgehog"><ins>something called the speed sphere launcher</ins></a> and it's exactly what it sounds like. You pop Sonic, or any other character, into the plastic sphere and use the velocity mechanism to send it careening through the course, loops and all. In other words, this playset seeks to recreate the actual feel of playing through an old-school 2D Sonic level. The set ships with nearly 300 pieces to rearrange how you like.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="3941ec90a4ec4aada75cb0af19a2fb02"></div><p>Other sets include Tail’s Worksop and Tornado Plane, which ships with nearly 400 pieces, and Amy’s Animal Rescue Island. Like all Lego sets, they are designed for mix-and-match scenarios in the hopes that you buy them all to create a glorious Franken-stage that takes up your entire house. To that end, you can use the speed sphere launcher with any of these sets, so long as there's enough room for the Blue Blur to do his thing.</p><p>Lego’s new Sonic-inspired play sets begin shipping on August 1st and range in price from $35 to $50. The dashing hedgehog with the extreme 1990s attitude is not the only Lego star pulled from a video game. The company has made <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lego-super-mario-starter-course-expansion-sets-review-090021993.html"><ins>playsets based on Mario</ins></a>, <em>Overwatch, Minecraft</em> and more.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/legos-new-sonic-the-hedgehog-sets-are-all-about-speed-160914948.html?src=rss

<p>Google may be close to launching its long-rumored <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-foldable-pixel-2022-report-android-12l-141906863.html">foldable Pixel phone</a>. <em>CNBC</em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/18/google-pixel-fold-release-date.html">claims</a> to have seen internal communications revealing that the Pixel Fold will be announced at the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-io-2023-takes-place-on-may-10th-in-front-of-a-limited-in-person-audience-232154501.html">I/O conference</a> on May 10th,  and ship in June. The device will reportedly cost around $1,700, or close to the $1,800 Samsung asks for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review-specs-price-a-flagship-foldable-refined-131543810.html">Galaxy Z Fold 4</a>.</p><p>The company may tout a few advantages over its rival. The Pixel Fold will have a book-like design with a 5.8-inch external screen and 7.6-inch folding display, but will supposedly have the &quot;most durable hinge&quot; of any foldable, according to Google. It should also be water-resistant and pack a larger battery that lasts up to 24 hours in normal use, and 72 hours with Extreme Battery Saver.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Don't expect performance gains. The Pixel Fold will apparently use the same Tensor G2 chip as in the<a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-7-and-pixel-7-pro-review-still-the-best-bargain-in-flagship-phones-170031940.html"> Pixel 7 series</a>, and previous leaks suggest it might have cameras that predate the Pixel 6. As with other Pixels, the draw may be the 'pure' Android experience — this will be the first opportunity to see Google's own approach to foldable devices.</p><p>The price is still steep compared to regular Pixel phones, which top out at $899 for the Pixel 7 Pro. Google may sweeten the deal by encouraging trade-ins, however. The company may even offer a free <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-watch-review-battery-life-fitbit-heart-rate-sensing-015412121.html">Pixel Watch</a> to Fold buyers.</p><p>If the details are accurate, the foldable Pixel may not be an easy sell. Google is expected to debut the Pixel 8 this fall, and that's likely to include upgrades like a third-generation Tensor chip. With that in mind, North Americans have had few options for foldable phones beyond the Galaxy Z Fold series and previous-gen Moto Razr models. The Pixel Fold may stand out simply by providing real competition in a small category.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-will-reportedly-announce-a-foldable-pixel-phone-at-io-next-month-155136945.html?src=rss

That's $10 more than the earbuds' all-time low but still about $30 below their average street price in recent months. For reference, they originally launched at $150. The deal applies to each color finish.</p><p></p><p>We gave the Studio Buds a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-studio-buds-review-150014566.html">review score of 84</a> when they launched in mid-2021. The best thing they have going for them is their design: They're small, lightweight and more than comfortable enough to wear for hours at a time. The shape is cleverly angled so that inserting and removing the earbuds feels natural. They're not as stable for jogging as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-fit-pro-review-140004462.html">Beats' Fit Pro</a>, but their <a href="https://www.enclosurecompany.com/ip-ratings-explained.php">IPX4-rated</a> water resistance means they can survive workouts all the same. Their case isn't oversized, either, and it charges over USB-C.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Studio Buds have a mellow and fairly well-balanced sound profile with bass that's punchy but not overbearing. They underemphasize the treble range a bit, so things like vocals can sound less detailed, but in general it's a pleasant listen with most types of music. There are active noise cancellation and transparency modes as well; neither is as effective as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html">higher-end models</a> like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/airpods-pro-review-second-generation-130048218.html">Apple's AirPods Pro</a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wf-1000xm4-review-160006474.html">Sony's WF-1000XM4</a>, but they're passable. (If you want superior ANC for less than $100, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwQjFMVkM1Vlo_dGg9MSZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby10bC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiY2Y0NDgyZjctZGVhYi00NGRjLWEyMjQtNzljZWY0NmJjZTIxIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAfQq_m0XLZRLV3h0kBSm-dRBYgpD1KWSZr1evBoYWx2H&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0B1LVC5VZ%3Fth%3D1">Anker's Soundcore Space A40</a> is a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-black-friday-headphone-and-earbud-deals-for-2022-130053886.html/#ankersoundcorespacea40">better buy</a>.) Like other Beats earbuds, the Studio Buds pair quickly with iPhones and support Apple-friendly perks like Find My device tracking and hands-free Siri access. But they also play well on Android, with similar fast-pairing and device-finding features.</p><p>There are some caveats, though. The Studio Buds' battery life is just OK, lasting around eight hours with ANC off and around five hours with it on. Call quality is similarly middling, and while the design is comfortable, it lacks features like wireless charging, automatic pausing when you remove an earbud and multipoint connectivity. Though the earbuds are easier to use with iPhones than most, they don't use one of Apple's proprietary wireless chips — ignore the Amazon listing that says otherwise — so they lack some features that you'd get with the Fit Pro or AirPods Pro, such as audio sharing and automatic switching between Apple devices. On the plus side, Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/25/beats-studio-buds-instant-pairing-update/">added support</a> for onboard volume controls and instant iCloud pairing since the Studio Buds launched.</p><p>The other possible hang-up is that Apple seems likely to launch a revised model of the Studio Buds in the near future. Reports<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/03/21/beats-studio-buds-headphones-coming-same-chip-airpods/"> from <em>9to5Mac</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/21/23650567/beats-studio-buds-plus-anc-transparency"><em>The Verge</em></a> say that these will be called the Studio Buds+ and feature improved ANC and transparency modes in a largely identical design. Exactly how much these will cost and whether they'll replace the current pair is unclear, but we may know soon, as FCC filings for the device <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/18/apple-beats-studio-buds-plus-fcc/">were spotted</a> just this week. Nevertheless, if you want a stylish pair of lightweight earbuds, the existing Studio Buds remain a solid value when they're discounted to this extent.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter and </em><a href="https://subscription.yahoo.net/Newsletter/Preference/sub?b=engadgetdeals&amp;src"><em>subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter</em></a><em> for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/beats-studio-buds-are-back-down-to-100-151601887.html?src=rss

## Meta begins its latest round of layoffs

<p>Meta has started the layoffs it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/zuckerberg-touts-year-of-efficiency-as-meta-lays-off-an-additional-10000-workers-131957819.html">announced in March</a>. The company has confirmed that it's letting go of the first wave of the roughly 10,000 affected employees. <em>CNBC</em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/19/meta-started-latest-round-of-layoffs-focusing-on-technical-employees.html">notes</a> that this initial round of job cuts focuses on technical roles, such as software engineer, AR/VR gameplay programmers and user experience designers. Business positions (such as finance and legal) will be cut in May. Other tech workers may be affected next month.</p><p>Company chief Mark Zuckerberg outlined the schedule for the cuts upon revealing them last month. This comes after Meta <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-mass-layoffs-facebook-111406126.html">laid off 11,000 people</a> last fall. The two rounds of cuts represent Meta's first mass layoffs, and Zuckerberg has characterized 2023 as a &quot;year of efficiency&quot; where the company narrows its focus and is theoretically more productive.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Meta is dealing with a rough economy like other <a href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech-layoffs-183005386.html">big tech firms laying off staff</a>, but is also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-meta-flunked-its-first-year-as-a-metaverse-company-150049067.html">struggling to pivot to the metaverse</a>. The social media pioneer has continued to pour billions of dollars into the Reality Labs unit responsible for its VR headsets and virtual platforms like Horizon Worlds, but these have yet to translate to major revenue growth. Ad revenue for Meta's main social platforms fell in 2022.</p><p>The company's outlook for its just-ended quarter suggests the worst of the downturns may be at an end. Results will be announced next week. Reality Labs isn't expected to turn a profit, though, and it may be some time before Meta's social businesses return to meaningful growth.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/meta-begins-its-latest-round-of-layoffs-145019127.html?src=rss

## ‘Paranormasight: The Seven Mysteries of Honjo’ is a delightfully subversive visual novel

<p><em>The Seven Mysteries of Honjo</em> is a visual novel that ties together nine (don’t ask) Japanese folktales, spirits, curses and, well, ukiyoe block prints. You’ll hop between several protagonists, trying to figure out who’s holding magical killer trinkets and who’s trying to collect them all from reviving the dead.</p><p>It’s the usual visual novel style of play: you talk to people, click on interesting things in the background, try to choose the right dialogue options, fail and try again. <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=21fc7c82-c5eb-49a9-b5d3-fc32a78290de&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Nintendo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyMWZjN2M4Mi1jNWViLTQ5YTktYjVkMy1mYzMyYTc4MjkwZGUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmludGVuZG8uY29tL3N0b3JlL3Byb2R1Y3RzL3BhcmFub3JtYXNpZ2h0LXRoZS1zZXZlbi1teXN0ZXJpZXMtb2YtaG9uam8tc3dpdGNoLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMjM3NGJjODktMDExOC00YjBlLWFmYmMtNTVhNmUzNzM2OTk5In0&amp;signature=AQAAAQV_BsugqdCsryWCJj2-hXqid5DEXFuki7ebBhW8QYDi&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fparanormasight-the-seven-mysteries-of-honjo-switch%2F"><em>Paranormasight</em></a> uses 360-degree environments to keep things <em>relatively</em> immersive. Each character illustration has frayed red, blue and green outlines that imitate old TVs – this was a time before OLED.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Paranormasight" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/36838a50-dd17-11ed-96b1-46ed2f707818" style="height: 720px; width: 1280px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nintendo</div></figure><p>What makes <em>Paranormasight</em> so much fun to play through is a rich vein of subversion — which I am not going to spoil. When you first begin the game, there’s a host of sorts, with a mysterious mask, who explains the game you’re about to play, how the menus work and other administrative fun.</p><p>When you (inevitably) meet your end due to poor decisions (or someone attacking you with cursed stones), it’ll cut back to the host, who will often hint at something that you’d have never guessed before – there are several ‘game overs’ that are inevitable for the early beats of the game to make sense. Fortunately, the game ‘logic’ settles in pretty quickly. You’ll hop between each character’s quests, with narrative paths unlocking further as the story unfolds and characters, curses and misunderstandings get messy.</p><p>In the first few chapters, you must confront others who may or may not be curse holders, unaware of how their curse “works”. This turns into an anime-style stand-off, like a fight in <em>JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure </em>or<em> Naruto</em>, as you either try to sneak your way out of danger or get other curse-bearers to fall into your trap, so you can claim their cursed stone and inch closer to the Rite of Resurrection.</p><p>It gets surprisingly tense at times. One confrontation occurs between a woman that wields a pyromaniac curse, while another character with a bludgeoning curse that can tell when you lie. This stand-off all happens in an innocuous living room, with a private investigator, dressed like a villain from the ‘70s looking on, baffled and powerless.</p><p>The player can jump between the overlapping timelines, even redoing very early decisions to see if they can change how the story progresses. I did find at one point that I was a little ahead of the story, but couldn’t continue with what I thought was the logical way forward until I’d clicked/tapped absolutely everything on a particular 360-degree scene.</p><figure><img alt="Paranormasight" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/36ababc0-dd17-11ed-bedc-3ece1d8b1f4c" style="height: 720px; width: 1280px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nintendo</div></figure><p>Everyone is seemingly hunting the Rite of Resurrection, which can supposedly bring anyone back from the dead – one character isn’t even looking to resurrect a friend or loved one, but Katsushika Hokusai, arguably the most famous Japanese artist of all time – the ‘tsunami’ guy. The characters have plenty of delightful quirks, which reminds me of Capcom’s Phoenix Wright series, but <em>Paranormasight</em> feels a little smarter.  Some of the twists and solutions break the fourth wall <em>brazenly</em> and I loved it. My only criticism is that <em>The Seven Mysteries of Honjo </em>is a little short – I finished it in 16 hours. Hopefully, more games will expand on this formula.</p><p>My spoiler-free advice is: listen to the masked host, keep an eye on your notes database as you learn more about the legends and don’t be afraid just to <em>guess</em> what might work. Often it does.</p><p><em>The game is available on Nintendo Switch, iOS, Android and Steam.</em></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/paranormasight-the-seven-mysteries-of-honjo-is-a-delightfully-subversive-visual-novel-140054226.html?src=rss

## The best cheap kitchen gadgets in 2023

<p>The best kitchen gadgets make certain cooking tasks easier without taking over your drawers. What’s more, some of the most useful ones won’t break the bank. All the recommendations on this list are either products I use currently, or more affordable versions of something I decided to splurge on after years of cooking. Not every item is essential, but they’re all things I’ve come to appreciate when I need to get dinner on the table quickly.</p><h2>Victorinox Honing Steel</h2><p></p><p>There are few things worse than cooking with a dull chef’s knife. It’s unsafe and a waste of time. You need a way to maintain your blades, and a good place to start is with a honing steel. Contrary to popular belief, a honing steel won’t sharpen your knives; what it will do is realign the blade. With consistent use of one, you can get away with actually sharpening your blades once every six months to a year. Almost any model will do the job, but for an affordable option, consider the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDA1TFJZVjAyP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXRoLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhNWVkNjI5ZS1mNTEzLTRjNGUtYWY2ZS02MDE4NmZhNjZkNjgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZoSkkIx-Ga_Qxrf7KRi0XuhUvRfpDJuql5aCcx9rSQS&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB005LRYV02%3F">10-inch Swiss Classic Honing Steel</a> from Victorinox. It comes with a comfortable handle that makes mastering the motion of honing a knife easy. Best of all, it costs less than $30.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Lavatools Javelin</h2><p></p><p>If you cook meat, you need to get yourself an instant-read thermometer. It will take all the guesswork out of braising, searing and roasting animal protein, making those dishes safer to eat and more delicious.</p><p>There are plenty of affordable instant-read thermometers out there, but I like the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDBHUkZIWFZRP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXRoLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhNWVkNjI5ZS1mNTEzLTRjNGUtYWY2ZS02MDE4NmZhNjZkNjgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAATI8nvI8na59ue-_sVeOA6QWki_vdr_p6qAn7570611m&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB00GRFHXVQ%3F">$27 Lavatools Javelin</a>. It’s not the fastest thermometer on the market – taking about four to five seconds to deliver a temperature reading – but it’s accurate to within a single degree Fahrenheit. The Javelin is also magnetic, so you can stick it on your fridge or knife holder for easy storage. Best of all, the casing is IP65-certified against water and features an antimicrobial coating Lavatools claims will inhibit 99.9 percent of pathogen growth. Oh, and you can buy the Javelin in nine different colors, including a cheerful “Wasabi” green hue.</p><h2>OXO Good Grips Food Scale</h2><p></p><p>After an instant-read thermometer, one of the few items I think everyone should have in their kitchen is a food scale. I know what you’re thinking: aren’t food scales only useful for baking? The answer is no. They will streamline every aspect of your cooking by allowing you to do away with measuring cups, while also giving you more accurate measurements overall. A scale is also essential if you’re calorie counting or tracking your macros.</p><p>After trying a few different scales, I like this <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDc5RDlCODJXP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXRoLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhNWVkNjI5ZS1mNTEzLTRjNGUtYWY2ZS02MDE4NmZhNjZkNjgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAT7tP9JEEG4ELCXl7-H_SK1bsgfNjxZ3Y8LQyqz0At8r&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB079D9B82W%3F">OXO Good Grips stainless steel model</a>. At under $60, the OXO model is a bit pricier than other food scales but it comes with a few features that set it apart. The first is a handy pull-out display that makes it easy to read the scale even when you have a large bowl on top. Plus, it also comes with an imperial/metric toggle. It’s handsome, too, with a design that’s easy to clean.</p><h2>Prepworks by Progressive Magnetic Measuring Spoons</h2><p></p><p>I’ll admit, sometimes it’s not practical to use a food scale to sort out ingredients, and you need to turn to a measuring spoon. After owning a few different models over the years, I’ve come to swear by magnetic ones. They’re easier to separate and subsequently easier to clean. <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDAxR0FRS0tXP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXRoLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhNWVkNjI5ZS1mNTEzLTRjNGUtYWY2ZS02MDE4NmZhNjZkNjgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAeV7QnvCDCMj0EKb-TuFc-mJexoz9ieN0Gc2rFoCJjS-&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB001GAQKKW%3F">Prepworks by Progressive</a> makes a thoughtfully designed set where each spoon features both a round and narrow end. The latter is perfect for measuring spices since it can fit in most jars.</p><h2>Microplane Professional Series Grater</h2><p></p><p>If you’re like me, you probably bought a box grater at the start of your cooking journey only to find out it’s terrible. I’m here to tell you there’s a better way to grate cheese and zest limes, and it’s called a Microplane. There are a few different variants, but they all offer the same advantages over a box grater. Being smaller, a Microplane is easier to maneuver over bowls and other dishes. As for what model to buy, I like the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDAwMDlXRTNaP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXRoLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhNWVkNjI5ZS1mNTEzLTRjNGUtYWY2ZS02MDE4NmZhNjZkNjgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAW2wlsLpgi5YeUpuxyOLloThGqWYZlriD7cb5zIYKR7Y&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB00009WE3Z">Professional Series line</a> for its wide blade and clean design. For zesting, you want to go for the “Fine” model. The “<a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDAwMDlXRTNYP3RoPTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tdGgtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImE1ZWQ2MjllLWY1MTMtNGM0ZS1hZjZlLTYwMTg2ZmE2NmQ2OCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAfDs4TO7rKqntigRg4LreY9hN-qSu-ZfVAtjPw4BrXiJ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB00009WE3X%3Fth%3D1">Ribbon</a>” variant is also great if you want to shave chocolate and cheese.</p><h2>Zwilling Handheld Vacuum Sealer Machine</h2><p></p><p>In the last few years, vacuum sealers have become affordable enough that most home cooks can add one to their kitchen. They’re a great way to reduce waste since meat and produce stored in airless bags will last longer. The right one can also help you reduce plastic waste.

The only thing to complain about the Zwilling vacuum sealer is that it charges over micro-USB(!).</p><h2>Zulay Silicone Utensil Rest</h2><p></p><p>Before moving to Portugal, my neighbor gifted my partner and I a silicone utensil rest. Since then, this simple tool has been an indispensable part of my kitchen arsenal. Once you start cooking at the stove, it helps to have all your tools right in front of you. A utensil rest helps with that while reducing the amount of cleanup you have to do afterward. Once you’re done, you can just toss it into the dishwasher. Best of all, you can buy one for about <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDdQVkJTODYzP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXRoLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhNWVkNjI5ZS1mNTEzLTRjNGUtYWY2ZS02MDE4NmZhNjZkNjgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAersgkz_VgQrVjnRbMCquwRa67zFnP0fodTn34Pr3IYS&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07PVBS863%3F">$10</a>.</p><h2>Cuisinart Electric Kettle</h2><p></p><p>While an electric kettle is nether essential for cooking or preparing tea and coffee, it can make both those tasks faster, safer and easier.

## Google could allow developers in the UK to use third-party payment providers

<p>Android users in the UK may get the choice to pay for apps and services on the platform through a billing system other than Google's. Ten months after the United Kingdom's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched an investigation into the tech giant's payment system for in-app purchases, Google offered to give developers in the region the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/app-developers-on-google-play-store-offered-payment-choices-following-cma-probe">choice to use alternative options</a>. The probe came following a separate investigation in which the CMA found Apple and Google held an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uk-regulator-probe-google-apple-mobile-duopoly-130013629.html">&quot;effective duopoly&quot; on mobile ecosystems</a>, and that Google's Play Store in particular could potentially lead &quot;to higher prices and reduced choice for Android users.&quot;</p><p>At the moment, the CMA is asking for feedback on Google's proposals and will continue accepting them until May 19th. If the organization decides to make the proposals legally binding based on people's feedback, then developers will be able to offer a payment system of their own choosing, known as &quot;Developer-only Billing&quot; or DOB, in the UK. They could also offer an alternative payment system next to Google's in a scheme known as &quot;User Choice Billing&quot; (UCB).&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That said, Google will still collect service fees from developers, which typically cost them between 15 to 30 percent of their earnings — it will just be a bit lower than usual. When developers don't offer Google Play billing at all, their service fee will be reduced by 3 percent. If they choose to offer an alternative payment method alongside Google's, and a customer chooses that, their service fee will be lowered by 4 percent.</p><p>The tech giant explained <a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/an-update-on-google-play-billing-in-the-uk/">in a post about its proposals</a>: &quot;The service fees for distributing apps via Android and Google Play will continue to be based on digital sales via our platform. The service fee is how we support our ongoing investments in Android and Google Play, reflects the value provided by Android and Google Play, and is how we earn money as a business.&quot;</p><p>Last year, Google allowed Android app developers to use third-party payments in several European Union states. The company also collects service fees in the EU no matter the billing system a user chooses, though the rates are also reduced if they pay using the alternative billing method.</p><p>Google says its commitments will be implemented in phases if the CMA decides to adopt them. The ability to add non-Google billing will initially be available to developers of non-gaming apps. Gaming app developers will be able to add alternative billing systems no later than October 2023.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-could-allow-developers-in-the-uk-to-use-third-party-payment-providers-121347912.html?src=rss

<p>Since February, Netflix has offered paid account sharing in Canada, New Zealand, Portugal and Spain. The add-on allows primary account holders to pay an additional fee every month to share their Netflix service with up to two people outside of their household. Now, it’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-is-about-to-crack-down-on-account-sharing-in-the-us-205918694.html">coming for US subscribers</a> – or non-subscribers. The company wrote in its Q1 letter to shareholders: “In Q1, we launched paid sharing in four countries and are pleased with the results.” It added: “We are planning on a broad rollout, including in the US, in Q2.” Netflix has estimated more than 100 million non-paying households have access to its service – and it wants them to pay <em>something</em>.</p><p>Netflix will also close its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-will-shut-down-its-dvd-rental-business-in-september-195213827.html">DVD rental business</a> in September.

## Tesla's latest price cut brings Model 3 pricing below $40,000

<p>Tesla has <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/04/18/tesla-slashes-price-again/">slashed its electric vehicles' prices</a> for the sixth time this year, on the eve of its next earnings report. It has quietly lowered the price for the Model 3, so that the the rear-wheel drive variant now starts at $39,990 or $2,000 less than what buyers would pay for it as recently as earlier this month. If you'll recall, the automaker already cut $1,000 off its price and started selling it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-cuts-ev-prices-for-the-fifth-time-this-year-161008384.html">for $41,990 the last time</a> it implemented price cuts just a couple of weeks ago. And earlier this year, Tesla <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-implements-huge-us-price-cuts-across-its-lineup-083211088.html">cut its prices quite drastically</a> across its lineup, with some models getting a price drop of as much as 20 percent.</p><p>As Tesla notes on its website, though, the rear-wheel drive model now only qualifies for $3,750 in tax credits after the government's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/starting-tomorrow-only-six-evs-will-still-qualify-for-a-7500-federal-tax-credit-185304414.html">change in guidelines</a> took effect on April 18th. The new rules are related to the US cutting off China as an approved trading partner, which would lead to EVs using China-made batteries losing tax credits as a result. To note, Tesla's other cars are still eligible for the full $7,500 tax credits, including the Model Y vehicles that also got a price cut.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The base, the Long Range and the Performance Model Y vehicles now cost $3,000 less than before. The base Model Y will now set buyers back $46,990, while the Long Range and Performance vehicles now cost $49,990 and $53,990, respectively. When Tesla reported its earnings for 2022 in January this year, Elon Musk said the company was seeing orders &quot;almost twice the rate of production.&quot; According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-19/tesla-drops-model-3-model-y-prices-on-eve-of-quarterly-earnings?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, though, Tesla was unable to sustain that rate of demand and has made the lowest number of deliveries in the first quarter of this year since 2021. Since the company reportedly produced thousands of vehicles more than it handed over to customers, these price cuts were likely implemented to sell existing inventory and to drum up demand going forward.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/teslas-latest-price-cut-brings-model-3-pricing-below-40000-071124983.html?src=rss
