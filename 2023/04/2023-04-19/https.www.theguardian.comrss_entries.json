over a four-decade career balancing \u2018serious\u2019 drama and improv comedy, describes the making of her wholly improvised new film, and explains why we don\u2019t see her on TV so much any more</p><p>\u201cI hope they don\u2019t want me to look wacky,\u201d frets Josie Lawrence on the way to the photoshoot for this interview, because she\u2019s here to talk about a serious film. On the other hand, she\u2019d love a plug for her regular Sunday night slot at <a href=\"https://www.chortle.co.uk/shows/misc_live_shows/c/18807/the_comedy_store_players\">London\u2019s Comedy Store</a>, where she has been improvising on and off for 38 years. The contradiction is a fact of life for a performer whose gift of the gab on Friday night TV bagged her a permanent place in the heart of the nation, eclipsing the parallel career in which she was excelling as a classical actor of Shakespeare and Stoppard.<br /><br />The interview is over lunch, at Lawrence\u2019s request, though she looks momentarily horrified when a plate of long, chewy pasta arrives, dripping with the sort of sauce you really don\u2019t want down your front for a photoshoot. She has arrived early, as she always does, and killed some time in a vintage shop close by, where she has bought herself an elegant coat dress. She jumps enthusiastically from her seat to show it off, exclaiming, at head-turning volume, \u201cI\u2019m terrible at buying clothes \u2013 my wardrobe is full of old things that I like to wear. But it\u2019s funny how things turn up when you\u2019re not looking.\u201d Far from deliberately drawing attention to herself, she seems oblivious that other diners might recognise her.</p><p>Her new film neatly marries the two sides of her career. It is the story of a pair of middle-aged sisters who return to their childhood home after the death of their charismatic but difficult mother, and decide to make their clear-out into an art installation. Directed by Jon Sanders and titled A Clever Woman, the film was shot over 10 days in an old curiosity shop of a house on the Isle of Wight, and is an entirely improvised exploration of bereavement, memory and the bonds of sisterhood.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/19/josie-lawrence-as-soon-as-i-could-speak-i-was-putting-on-shows\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/19/josie-lawrence-as-soon-as-i-could-speak-i-was-putting-on-shows", "date_published": "2023-04-19 15:16:45+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Netflix hit hardest in Britons\u2019 post-Christmas \u2018subscription cull\u2019", "description": "<p>Exclusive: households cancelled almost 170,000 streaming service subscriptions in first quarter of 2023</p><p>British households stopped paying for almost 170,000 streaming services in three months of the year, as increasingly budget-conscious consumers embarked on a post-Christmas <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/jan/30/uk-homes-cancelled-2m-streaming-services-cost-of-living-netflix\">\u201csubscription cull\u201d</a> that hit market-leader Netflix the hardest.</p><p>While TV fans flocked to hit shows The Last of Us, Clarkson\u2019s Farm and You \u2013 the three most popular shows on subscription video-on-demand services in the first three months \u2013 7% of British households cancelled at least one service in a new year spending cut.</p><p>The Last of Us (Sky Now)</p><p>Clarkson\u2019s Farm (Amazon Prime Video)</p><p>You (Netflix)</p><p>Wednesday (Netflix)</p><p>The Rig (Prime Video)</p><p>The Mandalorian (Disney+)</p><p>Star Trek: Picard (Paramount+)</p><p>Ginny &amp;

The science in these books is not incidental; it thrusts pathology into the pages as a central character, variously demanding the physician\u2019s and patient\u2019s understanding, negotiation, appeasement and reconciliation.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/19/top-10-medical-memoirs-by-patients\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/19/top-10-medical-memoirs-by-patients", "date_published": "2023-04-19 11:00:15+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Who makes our combined XI from the Women\u2019s Champions League final four?", "description": "<p>In this week\u2019s newsletter we pick a team from Chelsea, Barcelona, Wolfsburg and Arsenal before the semi-finals</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/22/sign-up-for-our-new-womens-football-newsletter-moving-the-goalposts\">Moving the Goalposts: sign up for our weekly newsletter</a></li></ul><p>With the first legs of the Women\u2019s Champions League semi-finals (Chelsea v Barcelona, and Wolfsburg v Arsenal) taking place this weekend we pick a combined XI from the four teams.</p><p><em><strong>Goalkeeper: Merle Frohms (Wolfsburg)</strong></em></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/19/moving-the-goalposts-combined-xi-from-the-womens-champions-league-final-four\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/19/moving-the-goalposts-combined-xi-from-the-womens-champions-league-final-four", "date_published": "2023-04-19 11:00:14+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Tell us: do you use a cassette player or Walkman?", "description": "<p>Amid a small cassette revival, we would like to hear from people who prefer them to more modern music players</p><p>As sales of cassettes and Walkmans reach their <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/04/19/cassette-sales-high-arctic-monkeys-retro-renaissance/\">highest level in years</a>, we would like to hear from people who prefer them to more modern music players.</p><p>Why do you favour cassettes?

The two of them had grown up in Clinton, a small rural town on the edge of the Ozarks in Arkansas, and had been best friends in high school. In their teens, both vowed they would leave and build a life away from the dysfunction and deprivation of their home town, but for Darci it didn\u2019t pan out like that. While Potts, who is now in her 40s, gained a scholarship to a college in Philadelphia, and became an award-winning political journalist (she has written for the New York Times and the Atlantic, and is now <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/monica-potts/\" title=\"\">senior politics reporter for FiveThirtyEight</a>), Darci failed to graduate high school and, like many in their social circle, never left Clinton. Over the years, Potts heard on the grapevine that Darci was struggling.

Subsequent studies revealed a sustained fall in life expectancy among the least educated white American women, and an increase in so-called \u201cdeaths of despair\u201d: drug overdoses, suicide and complications from alcoholism. Further research in 2018 by economists at Dartmouth College also revealed rising numbers of deaths from cancer, heart disease and respiratory illness among women below the poverty line. One of the researchers, Charlie Rafkin, told Potts that women suffered from a range of disadvantages, making it hard to pinpoint a single cause for the mortality increase. Instead he attributed it to a \u201cgeneral malaise\u201d.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/19/the-forgotten-girls-by-monica-potts-review-broken-heartlands\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/19/the-forgotten-girls-by-monica-potts-review-broken-heartlands", "date_published": "2023-04-19 08:00:33+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "UK inflation: which goods and services have risen most in price?", "description": "<p>From sugar to bread, electricity to pet products, how costs have soared</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/apr/19/uk-inflation-falls-consumer-prices-index\">UK inflation falls by less than expected</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2023/apr/19/uk-inflation-report-march-cost-of-living-crisis-business-live\">Business live \u2013 latest updates</a></li></ul><p>The UK\u2019s annual inflation rate fell in March, but not by as much as forecast, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/apr/19/uk-inflation-falls-consumer-prices-index\">remaining in double digits at 10.1%</a>, with the price of many of the items used to calculate the figure continuing to rise at a much faster rate.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/office-for-national-statistics\">Office for National Statistics</a> compiled the overall number using the consumer prices index but also logs prices for individual goods and services.
