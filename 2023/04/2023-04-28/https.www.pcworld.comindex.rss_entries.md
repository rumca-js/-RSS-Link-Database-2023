<p>What&rsquo;s in there? A better question might be, what <em>isn&rsquo;t </em>in there? The <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.ifixit.com/products/repair-business-toolkit&amp;xcust=2-1-1803685-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">$300 collection</a> includes the Pro Tech Toolkit, which itself has a driver with dozens of bits and an extender in a magnetic case, various tweezers, spudgers, and a suction cup gripper, plus an anti-static wristband, all organized into a tool roll.

## Microsoft PC peripherals are now collector’s items

<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s peripherals are dead. Long live Microsoft (Surface) peripherals.</p>



<p>After decades of shipping Microsoft-branded peripherals like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407281/microsoft-modern-keyboard-review-the-sleek-design-and-fingerprint-scanner-will-cost-you.html">Microsoft Modern Keyboard</a>, Microsoft is calling it quits. Instead, Microsoft will shift its emphasis to Surface-branded peripherals&mdash;which include some similar peripherals, sold under the Surface brand. But not all.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Going forward, we are focusing on our Windows PC accessories portfolio under the Surface brand,&rdquo; says Dan Laycock, senior communications manager at Microsoft, in a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/27/23700998/microsoft-keyboard-mouse-webcam-discontinued-surface-brand&amp;xcust=2-1-1803581-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">statement</a> given to&nbsp;<em>The Verge</em>. &ldquo;We will continue to offer a range of Surface branded PC accessories&mdash;including mice, keyboards, pens, docks, adaptive accessories, and more. Existing Microsoft-branded PC accessories like mice, keyboards, and webcams will continue to be sold in existing markets at existing sell-in prices while supplies last.&rdquo;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s not clear, however, how closely Microsoft&rsquo;s Surface peripherals lineup will overlap with its existing peripherals, raising the question of whether Microsoft is actually partially withdrawing from the market, or if the logo will simply change on the box. Microsoft&rsquo;s <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/surface-ergonomic-keyboard/90pnc9ljwpx9?activetab=pivot:overviewtab&amp;xcust=2-1-1803581-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Surface Ergonomic Keyboard</a> (sold out, incidentally) looks virtually identical to the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-LXM-00001-Ergonomic-Keyboard/dp/B07Y414QXJ&amp;xcust=2-1-1803581-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard</a>, though one is covered in Alcantara fabric and the other is plastic. The <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/surface-arc-mouse/8MRMSZC6VXKC/DBH4&amp;xcust=2-1-1803581-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Surface Arc Mouse</a> looks pretty much the same as the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Arc-Mouse-ELG-00001-Black/dp/B072FG8LBV&amp;xcust=2-1-1803581-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Microsoft Arc Mouse</a>, too, though in different colors. But others, like the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/microsoft-designer-compact-keyboard/8zhrtr7zcswq?activetab=pivot:overviewtab&amp;xcust=2-1-1803581-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Microsoft Designer Keyboard</a>, don&rsquo;t have any Surface equivalents.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s an ironic twist given Microsoft&rsquo;s news that its <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1798427/surface-sales-plunge-and-you-should-be-celebrating.html">Surface business has suffered a 30 percent drop in sales</a>, and that inventories in reseller channels remain high. That usually suggests sales are in the offing. </p>



<p>The problem is that Surface is a premium brand, and Microsoft charges accordingly. At Amazon, the Microsoft Arc Mouse is $48.58, while Microsoft prices the Surface Arc Mouse at $66.99. Microsoft also doesn&rsquo;t make Surface equivalents for everything in its product line&mdash;Microsoft&rsquo;s Lifecam webcam, for example. (We asked Microsoft for additional comment, and we&rsquo;ll update this post accordingly.)</p>



<p>Interestingly, neither &ldquo;Microsoft&rdquo; nor &ldquo;Surface&rdquo; keyboards make the cut in our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/414972/best-wireless-keyboards.html">best wireless keyboards</a>, and Microsoft products don&rsquo;t appear in our list of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393756/1080p-webcam-buying-guide.html">the best webcams</a>, either. But the Microsoft Arc Mouse and Microsoft Bluetooth Mouse make the cut as some of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393679/best-wireless-mouse.html">the best computer mice</a> on the market&mdash;for now, anyway.</p>



<p>Microsoft launched the Microsoft Natural Keyboard in 1994, meaning that we&rsquo;ve had several decades of Microsoft products. But all good things must come to an end, apparently.</p>

## Why does the Steam Deck run Linux? Blame Windows

<p>Valve&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/617378/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-the-steam-deck.html">Steam Deck handheld PC</a> has caused quite a stir among PC gaming geeks, but the biggest shakeup might not be <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3625578/valve-steam-deck-vs-nintendo-switch-which-gaming-handheld-should-you-buy.html">its Nintendo Switch-like form factor</a>. The software running inside of it is the real surprise. Why does the Steam Deck run Linux? Blame Windows.</p>



<p>The Steam Deck and the software inside of it are the culmination of a nearly decade-long &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/259893/video_game_publishing_ceo_trash_talks_windows_8.html">hedging strategy</a>&rdquo; embarked upon by Valve chief Gabe Newell and company many moons ago, when Microsoft tried exerting more control over developers with Windows 8.</p>



<p>But it&rsquo;s also the next phase of Valve&rsquo;s escape plan.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Editor&rsquo;s note: </strong>With the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1796614/hands-on-the-rog-ally-is-the-steam-deck-for-gamers-who-want-more-power-and-options.html">Asus ROG Ally appearing as a potential true Steam Deck competitor</a> and leaks of a &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1785380/of-course-microsoft-is-working-on-windows-handheld-mode-for-steam-deck-rivals.html">Windows handheld mode</a>&rdquo; making the rounds, we wanted to re-run this analysis of how Valve laid the long-term groundwork for the Steam Deck. The original story continues below; it published on August 6, 2021, before the Steam Deck&rsquo;s launch, so statistics and commentary on Proton&rsquo;s specific rough edges may no longer be applicable. (SteamOS now <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3137321254689909033&amp;xcust=2-1-394953-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">supports Easy Anti-Cheat and BattlEye software</a>, for example.)</p></blockquote>



<h2 id="a-catastrophe">&ldquo;A catastrophe&rdquo;</h2>



<p>Windows 10 <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2948353/a-tribute-to-windows-8-if-it-hadnt-been-so-bad-windows-10-wouldnt-be-so-good.html">smoothed over Windows 8&rsquo;s worst sins</a>, so you may not remember how different&mdash;or &ldquo;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/7/25/3186615/valve-gabe-newell-gaming-interface-windows-8-interview&amp;xcust=2-1-394953-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">a catastrophe</a>,&rdquo; to use Newell&rsquo;s words&mdash;that operating system was when it launched in 2012.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/08/windows-8-100897790-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="windows 8" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/08/windows-8-100897790-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption>
<p>Windows 8&rsquo;s radical new &lsquo;Start Screen&rsquo; was&hellip;divisive, to say the least. (Spot the desktop &ldquo;app&rdquo;?)</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p>Windows 8 bent over backwards to make mobile UI a priority, relegating the desktop to &ldquo;just another app&rdquo; status in a screen full of colorful tiles. More ominously, the Windows Store launched alongside the operating system, with strict requirements about the sorts of software allowed and a steep gatekeeper fee similar to what Apple and Google charge for inclusion in their app stores. Developers feared Microsoft would become increasingly draconian in its rules. Their concerns were escalated by the simultaneous launch of Windows RT, an Arm-based version of Windows that restricted users to using&nbsp;<em>only</em>&nbsp;software sanctioned by the Windows Store. (RT quickly fizzled.)</p>



<p>Devoted PC game developers felt especially anxious. Newell called it &ldquo;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.kotaku.com.au/2013/01/gabe-newell-windows-8-was-a-giant-sadness/&amp;xcust=2-1-394953-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">a giant sadness</a>.&rdquo; Blizzard executive VP Rob Pardo tweeted that Windows 8 is &ldquo;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2012-07-27-blizzard-gives-thumbs-up-to-newells-windows-8-catastrophe-comment&amp;xcust=2-1-394953-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">not awesome for Blizzard either</a>&rdquo; in the wake of Newell&rsquo;s &lsquo;catastrophe&rsquo; comment.&nbsp;<em>Minecraft </em>creator Markus &ldquo;Notch&rdquo; Persson told Microsoft to &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2010832/minecraft-creator-tells-microsoft-to-stop-trying-to-ruin-the-pc.html">stop trying to ruin the PC as an open platform</a>&rdquo; when it asked him to certify the game for Windows 8.</p>



<p>While Notch ironically <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2683173/microsoft-buys-minecraft-maker-mojang-for-25-billion.html">sold <em>Minecraft </em>to Microsoft for $2.5 billion</a> just a couple of years later, Newell and Valve reacted to the &ldquo;catastrophe&rdquo; the way most sane folks would: Disaster prep, so they wouldn&rsquo;t be caught flat-footed if Microsoft decided to clench its fist around the open PC ecosystem.</p>



<h2 id="the-steamos-escape-hatch">The SteamOS escape hatch</h2>



<p>Windows 8 launched on August 1, 2012. In December, 2013, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2080926/steamos-beta-impressions-well-valve-did-warn-you-to-wait.html">Valve introduced SteamOS to the masses</a>.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/08/steamos-100897788-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="steamos" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/08/steamos-100897788-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a></figure></div>




<p>Well, not really. The beta version of the Steam-centric operating system required arcane technical knowledge to install, and Valve itself warned that &ldquo;unless you&rsquo;re an intrepid Linux hacker already, we&rsquo;re going to recommend that you wait until later in 2014 to try it out.&rdquo; The operating system certainly had plenty of rough edges out of the gate&mdash;it worked <em>only</em> with Nvidia GPUs, for example&mdash;but Valve worked diligently on polishing them. By October 2015, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2992487/steam-machines-unleashed-impressions-from-one-week-in-a-steam-powered-living-room.html">Valve&rsquo;s Steam Machines launched</a>.</p>



<p>And failed. Hard.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2237500/why-the-biggest-problem-with-steam-machines-are-the-steam-machines-themselves.html">Steam Machine endeavor was doomed from the start</a>, and I laid out the case for why&nbsp;they would even before they launched. There were several reasons: delays, poor communication from Valve, an <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2992126/valve-steam-controller-hands-on-opening-a-new-world-of-pc-gaming-possibilities.html">unorthodox new Steam Controller</a> needed to use the PCs, the simultaneous launch of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2992645/hands-on-valves-50-steam-link-is-the-game-streaming-solution-you-wantmost-of-the-time.html">more-versatile Steam Link</a>, and a &ldquo;good, better, best&rdquo; branding strategy for Steam Machine makers that sowed further confusion. But in retrospect the biggest problem was SteamOS itself.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/08/origin-pc-chronos-steam-machine-100897787-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="origin pc chronos steam machine" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/08/origin-pc-chronos-steam-machine-100897787-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption>

<p>SteamOS could only run Linux games, you see. And gaming on Linux was dismal in 2015. I used to maintain <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2363780/linux-gaming-rising-7-big-name-pc-games-that-now-call-linux-home.html">a list of the best Linux games</a> because so few developers bothered to create Linux ports. Coaxing games into running often required exotic workarounds and third-party tools, and even then, games that ran <em>at all</em> often ran jankily. Again: It&rsquo;s no surprise Steam Machines failed.</p>



<p>Valve learned its lesson. You don&rsquo;t stop planning for a catastrophe just because you run into some road bumps. After Steam Machines died, something much more momentous&mdash;and the key to the Steam Deck&rsquo;s existence&mdash;rose from their ashes.</p>



<h2 id="proton-linux-lessons-learned">Proton: Linux lessons learned</h2>



<p>If developers wouldn&rsquo;t make games for Linux, Valve decided it would invest in making <em>Windows </em>games run on Linux instead. In 2018, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3299641/steam-adds-proton-making-windows-games-playable-on-linux.html">Valve introduced Proton</a>, a fork of the popular WINE compatibility layer that lets Linux PCs play Windows games. (If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with WINE, count yourself lucky.)</p>



<p>&ldquo;There was always kind of this classic chicken and egg problem with the Steam Machine,&rdquo; Valve designer Scott Dalton told <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-deck-valve-explains-how-it-learned-from-past-mistakes&amp;xcust=2-1-394953-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">IGN</a>. &ldquo;That led us down this path of Proton, where now there&rsquo;s all these games that actually run.&rdquo;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/07/protondb-most-popular-100895892-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="protondb most popular" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/07/protondb-most-popular-100895892-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption>
<p>The ProtonDB homepage on July 16, 2021.</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p>Proton was truly a game-changer. If Linux gaming was a near-barren desert before, Proton was the water it so desperately needed. Thousands upon thousands of Windows games could <em>just be played</em> on Linux PCs now&mdash;some tinkering required at times, natch. Over the last few years, Valve (with help from the WINE experts at CodeWeavers) has worked hard to fix the most glaring issues. In 2018, our curated list of the best Linux games topped out at 35 titles. Right now, the community-run <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.protondb.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-394953-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">ProtonDB website</a> is tracking almost 19,000 Proton-compatible games, and over 15,000 of them run just fine on Linux.</p>



<p>The technology still isn&rsquo;t <em>quite </em>perfect, as our look at <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3625673/what-is-proton-the-steam-decks-live-or-die-software-explained.html">how Proton will make or break the Steam Deck</a> details in more depth. The most popular multiplayer shooters don&rsquo;t work on Linux because BattlEye and Easy Anti-Cheat aren&rsquo;t compatible with Proton. Valve says it&rsquo;s working with those studios to get support for the technology ahead of the Steam Deck&rsquo;s launch. If the past is any indication, Valve will get it right eventually. (<strong>Update</strong>: <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3137321254689909033&amp;xcust=2-1-394953-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">It did</a>.)</p>



<h2 id="the-steam-deck-is-a-trojan-horse">The Steam Deck is a Trojan Horse</h2>



<p>Valve isn&rsquo;t just pushing a handheld gaming PC. Gabe Newell and company are still preparing for potential catastrophe. While you could look at the Steam Deck as the culmination of nearly a decade of work for Valve, you can also look at it in the other direction. If the Steam Deck is successful, it will force developers to devote more attention to Linux&mdash;or at least to consider Proton compatibility while coding. With each game that runs just fine on the Steam Deck, Valve&rsquo;s escape hatch opens a few inches wider.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/07/steam-deck-off-100895893-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="steam deck off" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/07/steam-deck-off-100895893-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a></figure></div>




<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re trying to make sure that Linux thrives,&rdquo; Newell told <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://venturebeat.com/2012/07/25/valves-gabe-newell-talks/&amp;xcust=2-1-394953-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Venture Beat</a> just ahead of Windows 8&rsquo;s launch in 2012. &ldquo;&hellip;We&rsquo;re going to continue working with the Linux distribution guys, shipping Steam, shipping our games, and making it as easy as possible for anybody who&rsquo;s engaged with us&mdash;putting their games on Steam and getting those running on Linux, as well.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The Steam Deck&mdash;and Proton before that, and Steam Machines before that, and SteamOS before <em>that</em>&mdash;drives home that Valve still has its eyes on the prize&hellip;and the potential for disaster. Without Windows 8, the Steam Deck as we know it would never exist, and Linux gaming wouldn&rsquo;t be anywhere near as vibrant as it is today.</p>

<p>After years of inflated pandemic-induced pricing, it&rsquo;s downright ludicrous how affordable gaming laptops are getting these days. Case in point: <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1528128/nab-this-rtx-powered-dell-gaming-laptop-for-a-ludicrously-cheap-650.html">Just last month</a>, we were psyched to find a Dell laptop with an RTX 3050 inside for $650, because finding good gaming laptops under $1,000 is <em>hard</em>. But today&rsquo;s deal goes even further. Both <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flenovo-ideapad-gaming-3-15-6-fhd-laptop-ryzen-5-5600h-8gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-3050-ti-256gb-ssd-shadow-black%2F6513216.p%3FskuId%3D6513216&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed" rel="nofollow">Best Buy</a> and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/ideapad/ideapad-gaming-laptops/gaming-3-gen-6-(15-amd)/82k201xcus&amp;xcust=2-1-1803499-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Lenovo itself</a> are selling a Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3 notebook with a more powerful RTX 3050 Ti inside for just $600, a steep discount from its usual $900 price tag and an absurd value for a gaming laptop.</p>



<p>Nvidia&rsquo;s GeForce RTX 3050 Ti should be able to handle virtually every game you throw at it, though you&rsquo;ll likely need to bump graphics settings down to High or Medium depending on newer, more intensive titles. That said, over 290 games support Nvidia&rsquo;s awesome, performance-boosting DLSS feature. By the way, this GPU plays nice with those for even faster frame rates.</p>



<p>Speaking of, esports enthusiasts will appreciate that the 1080p display runs at a speedy 120Hz. Lenovo rounded out the package with a 6-core Ryzen 5600H processor, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of SSD storage. The RAM and SSD capacities may be modest, but should hold up just fine at the graphics settings the RTX 3050 Ti can handle. You can&rsquo;t get it all when you&rsquo;re getting an RTX-powered gaming laptop for just $600.</p>



<p>And, really, that&rsquo;s the essence of this deal: Finding a capable gaming laptop <em>this</em> cheap is an absolute steal. There&rsquo;s no indication when this deal will end, so hop on it now to make sure you don&rsquo;t miss out.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing worse than gaming for hours on end with a poorly constructed headset. If you&rsquo;re on the hunt for a lightweight gaming headset, the Razer Kraken is definitely worth considering. Amazon&rsquo;s currently selling the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Kraken-Gaming-Headset-2019/dp/B07N85FY1G&amp;xcust=2-1-1803293-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">accessory for just $44.99</a>, which is 44 percent off of the original $79.99 price. Not only does this headset boasts cooling gel-infused ear cushions, which sounds like a dream come true, but it also weighs well under a pound. Let&rsquo;s dive into the other features.</p>



<p>The Kraken features large <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.razer.com/technology/razer-triforce-drivers&amp;xcust=2-1-1803293-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">50 mm drivers</a>, which are essential for producing crystal clear sound. According to Razer, the &ldquo;titanium-coated diaphragms&rdquo; inside the drivers provides &ldquo;clarity to any vocals you hear.&rdquo; It also has a detachable microphone and Chroma RGB lighting. One Amazon reviewer claims that she can wear the headset with glasses for hours. This is promising feedback. If you wear glasses (hi), you&rsquo;re probably well aware of how frustrating it can be to wear them with a headset. </p>



<p>This is a killer deal. You best scoop it up now before it&rsquo;s gone.</p>

<p>Monoprice has a well-deserved reputation for no-nonsense budget hardware and components, but the Monoprice 2K USB Webcam may be an exception: a budget webcam that&rsquo;s a little too cheaply made to be worth your time. The price, though, is tough to beat.</p>



<p>Full disclosure: While we tested this webcam thoroughly, we can&rsquo;t show you any representative pictures that it captured. Why not? After toting it around to test its performance in various lighting conditions, and putting it back on top of an external display, it fell off, landing on the desk&mdash;and stopped working. </p>



<p>(Though Monoprice and Amazon use the &ldquo;2K USB Webcam&rdquo; as a product name, the device is formally named the Workstream by Monoprice 2K USB Webcam with LED Light Ring and Lens Cover.)</p>



<p>On paper, this Monoprice webcam seems pretty solid: The 2592&times;1944 resolution offers more detail than now-standard 1080p webcams, albeit at 30Hz. Though neither Monoprice nor Amazon advertises it as such, this webcam autofocuses on your face, and is suitably responsive when you lean forward or back. One additional feature is that it has a ring light, with three levels of lighting that can be adjusted via a front-mounted button.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Further reading:</strong> See our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393756/1080p-webcam-buying-guide.html">best webcams</a> to learn about competing products.</p></blockquote>



<p>The Monoprice 2K USB Webcam&rsquo;s frame has minimal amounts of padding to cushion your monitor, with the standard overhanging &ldquo;jaw&rdquo; that allows it to clip over the top of a monitor or laptop display. That sometimes can give users pause, though the webcam seems light enough that it won&rsquo;t push into your display. If that does worry you, however, the &ldquo;jaws&rdquo; fold flat, creating a flat stand, and there&rsquo;s a screw hole to attach a tripod (not included). There&rsquo;s an extremely stiff gimbal that allows the webcam to tilt forward and rotate side to side, though it allows just a few degrees of movement. A USB-A cable measuring about 52 inches connects it all together.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Monoprice 2K USB Webcam primary" class="wp-image-1791961" height="844" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Monoprice-webcam-hero.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The Monoprice 2K USB Webcam, with an integrated ring light and DIY privacy shutter.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Our external display has a thicker bezel than most, but was nonetheless accommodated by the 2K USB Webcam&rsquo;s design. The lack of padding or grip made it easy to slide back and forth, which can be a positive. But as it turned out, the weight of the cord and some possible user-carelessness caused it to plunge to its doom.</p>



<p>The real, puzzling issue with this webcam is that it&rsquo;s designed with a ring light to allow you to be well lit in Zoom and Teams calls. However, the camera, by apparent design, can overexpose your face under certain lighting scenarios. Monoprice&rsquo;s 2K Webcam works best when clipped over the top of a laptop screen, or as a standalone camera. There, your face will look natural, with good lighting and color balance. The additional resolution will help your face look great, too. You&rsquo;ll notice the same results in a dimly lit room&mdash;again, with the webcam clipped over a laptop.</p>



<p>(Some users complained that the camera zooms in too much. First, we&rsquo;d disagree. But there aren&rsquo;t any zoom controls, manual or otherwise, to adjust this. Most budget webcams don&rsquo;t have this option either.)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Monoprice includes a little flipcover plastic shutter inside the 2K USB Webcam&rsquo;s box, that you must stick on. Yes, you must peel off a bit of sticky backing and affix it yourself&mdash;don&rsquo;t mess it up!</p></blockquote></figure>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Monoprice 2K USB Webcam" class="wp-image-1791962" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Monoprice-webcam-open.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The Monoprice 2K USB Webcam has a fairly standard clamp, though it didn&rsquo;t save our review unit from falling backwards. That&rsquo;s partially our fault, to be fair.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Clipping the webcam over an external display, though, introduces problems. For whatever reason, Monoprice&rsquo;s webcam simply can&rsquo;t account for the light generated by the display, especially in light mode. The result is that the Monoprice webcam will probably overexpose your face, making you look pale and ghostly. Adding the ring light on top of it just makes the problem worse.</p>



<p>There are two other quirks that this webcam offers, neither a positive. For one, Monoprice doesn&rsquo;t offer a built-in privacy shutter. Instead, Monoprice includes a little flipcover plastic shutter inside the 2K USB Webcam&rsquo;s box, that you must stick on. Yes, you must peel off a bit of sticky backing and affix it yourself&mdash;don&rsquo;t mess it up! Secondly, the webcam&rsquo;s mics are lousy. They&rsquo;re functional, but you may want to switch the audio within Zoom or Teams to a laptop or external mic of some sort.</p>



<p>Honestly, the price of the Monoprice 2K USB Webcam makes it hard to <em>not</em> recommend: again, on paper, there&rsquo;s a lot going for it. In practice, however, you might want to consider one of our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393756/1080p-webcam-buying-guide.html">recommended webcams</a> instead.</p>

## Steam’s in-game overlay gets a ton of helpful new tools

<p>There&rsquo;s a note in my Google Keep account that&rsquo;s years and years old, documenting my ideal <em>Skyrim</em> armor setup, complete with dozens of doubled-up and stacked enchantments, many of which are only possible because of extensive modding. The latest Steam beta update might be made specifically for me, because the addition of a cloud-based note system to the in-game overlay is the perfect spot for this most nerdy of lists. </p>



<p>The new Notes app lets you save more or less any text-based messages for yourself, sync them across your Steam installations, and pin them to the screen while you&rsquo;re playing. You can even edit them outside the game, if you&rsquo;re deep into a wiki dive on how to optimize your <em>Baldur&rsquo;s Gate </em>build. But <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/3686801719529689368&amp;xcust=2-1-1803279-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">that&rsquo;s only the start of the new additions</a> to Steam&rsquo;s in-game interface. The toolbar and game overview screens have been redesigned, including chats, guides, and a full browser you can open without closing your game. Any of these can be pinned to your screen while playing your game for easy access without switching windows. </p>



<p>Steam says that the notification system has also been overhauled, limiting the tray view to new notifications with a more extensive &ldquo;view all&rdquo; page elsewhere, and the Screenshot Manager is now faster with options for large or small thumbnails. Under the hood, Steam&rsquo;s desktop client, Big Picture Mode, and Steam Deck implementations have been given some upgrades that should mean faster iterations of changes across all three interfaces. </p>



<p>The beta is available to download now (<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/276C-85A0-C531-AFA3#:~:text=With%20Steam%20running%2C%20click%20on,down%20list%20and%20click%20%22OK%22&amp;xcust=2-1-1803279-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here&rsquo;s how to try it</a> if you&rsquo;re new), and most or all of these features should make it to the standard build within the next few months. </p>

## Microsoft Edge’s frenetic quest to dethrone Chrome keeps hitting snags

<p>This week, news broke that Microsoft Edge is seemingly leaking all the URLs we visit to Bing&mdash;that is, directly to Microsoft itself. Discovered by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.reddit.com/r/browsers/comments/12u9y5g/what_is_causing_edge_to_leak_all_visited_urls/&amp;xcust=2-1-1801888-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Reddit</a> and reported by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/25/23697532/microsoft-edge-browser-url-leak-bing-privacy&amp;xcust=2-1-1801888-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">The Verge</a>, the bug appears to be tied to a new feature in Edge that allows users to follow their favorite creators. But instead of notifying Bing of select web addresses, like YouTube and Reddit, it&rsquo;s beaming everything back home to the mothership. This isn&rsquo;t the first problem tied to Edge&rsquo;s torrid pace of new feature releases, either.</p>



<p>Microsoft is aware of the issue, telling The Verge in a statement that it&rsquo;s investigating the reports and &ldquo;will take appropriate action to address any issues.&rdquo; (Don&rsquo;t worry, The Verge subtly reassured everyone that visits to adult websites remain a secret, thanks to a master filter blocking certain URLs from being sent. Apparently Microsoft doesn&rsquo;t want to know that info, either.) In the meanwhile, however, you can nip this problem in the bud by turning off the feature:</p>



<ol><li>Type <strong>edge://settings/privacy</strong> into your address bar, or click on the three-dot menu and choose <em>Settings &gt; Privacy, search, and services</em>.</li><li>Scroll down to the <em>Services </em>section.</li><li>Flip the toggle for <em>Show suggestions to follow creators in Microsoft Edge</em> to off. This will turn off the feature for follow suggestions and notifications for new content.</li></ol>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1801932" height="817" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-16.png" width="813" /><figcaption>If you haven&rsquo;t dug deep into Edge, you may be surprised what settings are on by default.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>While you&rsquo;re in that part of settings, you may notice (as I did) another feature with privacy concerns&mdash;the Shopping tool. Set on by default, it collects browsing history and page content for use in further product development. This part of the settings is a bit of a microcosm for the overall Edge experience&mdash;features with good intentions but possible issues, and not always easily found or clearly explained. This approach is a pity, too, since some of Edge&rsquo;s many features over time have been groundbreaking and/or innovative.</p>



<p>Take <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406111/tested-microsoft-edge-is-the-only-browser-to-run-netflix-in-4k.html">4K support in Netflix</a> back in 2017. At that time, other browsers were stuck at 720p, but not Edge. Heck, most people didn&rsquo;t even have a 4K monitor yet either, due to availability and cost&mdash;it was extremely forward-thinking on Microsoft&rsquo;s part. (That&rsquo;s not the case today, as you can see by glancing at <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/811315/best-monitors-2.html">our roundup of the best monitors</a>.) Edge also offers tight integration with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/397667/get-3-years-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-tip.html">Xbox Game Pass</a>, allowing you to jump straight into cloud-gaming titles when signed into your account. And more recently, Microsoft&rsquo;s AI chatbot, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1520736/microsoft-is-bringing-bing-chat-to-mobile-edge-bing-and-skype.html">Bing Chat</a>, was made available through Edge (including mobile platforms), as was the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1780581/microsoft-edge-now-puts-an-ai-image-generator-at-your-fingertips.html">integration of an AI-art generator</a>.</p>



<p>On the flipside, Edge has gone in questionable directions as well. This issue with URL leakage isn&rsquo;t the only stain on its record. Back in 2021, Microsoft experimented with a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/556734/edge-browsers-new-buy-now-pay-later-tool-has-users-fuming.html">tool that recommended a loan service while shopping</a>. (Ick.) More recently, rumors of a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/21/23649834/microsoft-edge-cryptocurrency-wallet-feature&amp;xcust=2-1-1801888-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">cryptocurrency wallet for Edge surfaced</a>&mdash;a controversial feature, given the uncertainty about crypto in some circles. (GPU pricing during the pandemic, ahem.)</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Microsoft Zip Edge Buy Now Pay Later" class="wp-image-555869" height="684" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Microsoft-Buy-Now-Pay-Later-Zip.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>This inclusion was a decision on Microsoft&rsquo;s part.</figcaption></figure><a class="imageCredit" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/introducing-buy-now-pay-later-in-microsoft-edge/m-p/2967030#M6024&amp;xcust=2-1-1801888-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Microsoft</a></div>



<p>And let&rsquo;s not forget the dubious sources of &ldquo;news&rdquo; that Edge uses to populate its feed when you open a new tab. I myself have complained about this on <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/morphingball/status/1620903773634977793?s=20&amp;xcust=2-1-1801888-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">one particularly terrible day</a> full of sensationalist headlines. (That one about the baby still really upsets me.)</p>



<p>Obviously, the Edge teams are working hard to distinguish their browser from Chrome and other Chromium-based offerings. And some features are genuinely helpful. (I still dig <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/785315/edges-vertical-tabs-are-weird-but-i-cant-give-them-up.html">vertical tabs</a>.) But these days, what I look for (as many others do, I think) is simplicity and trustworthiness in software. I want a clean, easy-to-understand interface paired with strong protections for my privacy and security. Edge remains a secondary browser for me because it&rsquo;s a little disorganized in how it presents features, much less one&rsquo;s ability to stay on top of managing them all. It also often forces new ones on you as default.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hopefully, this sighting on Twitter of an ability to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.techradar.com/news/microsoft-edge-looks-set-to-solve-chromes-biggest-problem-bloat&amp;xcust=2-1-1801888-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">pick and choose</a> which of Edge&rsquo;s features get installed will become a thing. Let me choose a streamlined, bare-bones version of Edge, please. Leave the other features in a running list within the settings. I&rsquo;ll get to them at my leisure.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a millennial, chances are you remember AIM&rsquo;s <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/jpgpey/a-history-of-smarterchild&amp;xcust=2-2-1787189-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">SmarterChild</a>, an &ldquo;intelligent&rdquo; chatbot that simulated human conversation. Sound familiar? Nowadays, ChatGPT&rsquo;s AI-infused chatbot is all the rage, providing smarter and more eloquent answers to just about any question you may have. As someone who bothered the heck out of SmarterChild as a kid, I was nostalgic for a similar experience, so I gave ChatGPT a try. </p>



<p>So, did ChatGPT win over this skeptical contrarian? It sure did. It felt like I was having a conversation with an actual human being, which SmarterChild just simply couldn&rsquo;t emulate during its heyday. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Want to try out ChatGPT? Here&rsquo;s how to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1507212/how-to-run-chatgpt-or-bing-as-a-windows-app.html">run it as a Windows app</a>.</p></blockquote>



<h2 id="i-was-wary-of-chatgpt-at-first">I was wary of ChatGPT at first</h2>



<p>Initially, I didn&rsquo;t love the idea of ChatGPT&hellip; or anything artificial intelligence-related for that matter. SmarterChild couldn&rsquo;t compose articles and essays like ChatGPT does&mdash;a feature I considered an affront to classic journalism. Maybe it was an overreaction, but I saw it as a threat to my career. I resisted the alluring pull of ChatGPT for months. I wouldn&rsquo;t even use those <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1672975/the-best-ai-art-generators-for-you-midjourney-bing-and-more.html">AI image generators</a> due to copyright issues. That said, curiosity eventually won out. Also, as a journalist in the tech field, I figured I should educate myself on it, as it&rsquo;s important to stay abreast of the latest tech trends. </p>



<p>SmarterChild gave basic information like the weather report and movie time listings, but ChatGPT will explain complex topics and write customized resumes and cover letters. ChatGPT proved to be a useful tool for those with inquiring minds. Heck, it&rsquo;ll even dole out relationship advice if you so desire. It&rsquo;s definitely more advanced and nuanced than SmarterChild. What surprised me was the fact that I kept going back to it with a new round of questions. I guess I&rsquo;m a convert now.</p>



<h2 id="instant-answers-instant-gratification">Instant answers, instant gratification</h2>



<p>The best thing about SmarterChild were the instantaneous answers. I was a lonely kid that spent a great deal of time on the family computer, so I liked having a chatbot to both talk to and infuriate. However, the answers weren&rsquo;t always very articulate or nuanced. In fact, SmarterChild was downright dismissive at times, as you can see in the below video. These somewhat indifferent responses were likely due to the limitations of AI technology at the time. As far as tech goes, we&rsquo;ve come a long way since the early 2000s. </p>



<p>The instant answers were nice, but actual conversations with SmarterChild were often cyclical in nature, especially when you asked complex questions. It was kind of like talking to an NPC (non-playable character) in a video game where they rotate through the same bit of dialogue over and over. It was fun to provoke an angry response out of the chatbot, but you&rsquo;d have to spend a good chunk of time spamming the heck out of it. ChatGPT is far more nuanced in how it engages with you.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>ChatGPT is also more respectful in tone and the answers are much more satisfactory. My questions were answered with certain level of finesse that the AIM chatbot couldn&rsquo;t hold a candle to. When I asked ChatGPT to tell me more about the greyhound breed (I own a former racer), I was surprised by the information it pulled from the web. Not only did it give me a brief history of the breed, but also information on the temperament and physicality. I&rsquo;m a bit of a history buff, so I really enjoyed learning about how they were kept as royal pets in ancient Egypt. </p>

<h2 id="chatgpt-had-me-feeling-my-oats">ChatGPT had me feeling my oats</h2>



<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be a genuine ChatGPT experience if you didn&rsquo;t ask it about yourself, which is exactly what I did. The AI chatbot did a good job summarizing my career as a tech journalist, but I didn&rsquo;t expect the complimentary tone that was peppered throughout the paragraphs. In the screenshot below, ChatGPT says I&rsquo;m &ldquo;considered to be a respected voice in the technology journalism field.&rdquo; Not that I need the confidence boost, but it&rsquo;s certainly nice! It&rsquo;s definitely more human-sounding, which is a welcome departure from SmarterChild&rsquo;s dismissive ways. I almost felt a real connection to it.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="ChatGPT answering questions" class="wp-image-1788686" height="641" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-17-115039.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="935" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Ashley Biancuzzo</p></div>



<h2 id="its-impossible-to-piss-chatgpt-off">It&rsquo;s impossible to piss ChatGPT off</h2>



<p>Millennials loved to anger SmarterChild and I was no different. Whenever I needed to burn off some teenage rage, I&rsquo;d cuss out the AIM chatbot. If you harassed it enough, it would start responding with snarky one word answers. SmarterChild definitely had a distinct personality and you just don&rsquo;t see that anymore. Was it fun? You bet. Was it inappropriate? Absolutely.</p>



<p>ChatGPT has the patience of a holy saint. In fact, when I intentionally insulted the bot, it apologized for <strong>offending me</strong>. What?! Although ChatGPT offers more nuanced answers to questions, you can&rsquo;t really piss it off like you could with SmarterChild, as it&rsquo;s programmed to not engage in inappropriate or offensive conversation. Oh well. You win some, you lose some. </p>



<p>Nowadays, I&rsquo;m less interested in insulting chatbots. I&rsquo;d much rather ask legitimate questions and receive complex answers, which ChatGPT does successfully&mdash;though you can&rsquo;t <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1721988/ai-chatbots-arent-search-engines-theyre-cryptobros.html">fully trust AI chatbots to tell the truth</a>, no matter how confident they sound. The excerpt above says I&rsquo;ve contributed to PCWorld&rsquo;s video content, for example, even though I never have. You need to double-check their facts.</p>



<p>That said, I&rsquo;ll always remember SmarterChild fondly, but ChatGPT is a much better tool overall. It breaks down mathematical equations and lines of code, and it&rsquo;ll even generate song lyrics. If you want to ask it philosophical questions like&hellip; Do we have free will? ChatGPT will provide a thoughtful answer. What can I say? SmarterChild walked so ChatGPT could run.</p>

<p>The SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7X is the Xbox variant in SteelSeries Nova 7 gaming headset lineup. Despite not being designed specifically for PC, the 7X is a top-notch option for PC gamers thanks to its excellent cross-platform compatibility, dual 2.4GHz wireless and simultaneous Bluetooth functionality. It also has a stylish, metal-clad build that feels so tough it could potentially survive a meteor shower.</p>



<p>Although it&rsquo;s more modestly priced than its premium sibling the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/705178/steelseries-arctis-nova-pro-wireless-headphones-review.html">Arctis Nova Pro Wireless</a>, the 7X is arguably a lot easier to use. It sports a good smattering of on-ear controls, which are nicely split between earcups and easy to remember so that you never need find yourself pressing mute in the throes of victory ever again.</p>



<h3 id="steelseries-arctis-nova-7x-wireless-design-and-build">SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7X Wireless design and build</h3>



<p>In recent years SteelSeries has done a commendable job convincing us its headsets are some of the finest&mdash;and toughest&mdash;you can get. The Arctis Nova Pro Wireless, for instance, jumped straight to a top spot in our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/820791/best-wireless-gaming-headsets.html">best wireless gaming headsets</a>, so impressed were we with its build quality, design, and sound.</p>

<p>By comparison, the Arctis Nova 7X is a less pretentious beast. It skimps on some of the Nova Pro&rsquo;s more premium features&mdash;like the base station&mdash;that, to be honest, we can live without. Instead, it shares more practical features like its flexible metal frame, metal cups, and magnetic earcup covers that you can slide off for a discrete headphone-like look.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7X Wireless" class="wp-image-1787680" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/20230413_124544.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The 7X&rsquo;s earcups are solid metal and feature removable outer caps.&nbsp;</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>That means it&rsquo;s both stylish and as solid as a tank; drop resistant, and better at avoiding scratches than all-plastic headsets. And, just like the Nova Pro, it&rsquo;s made to move naturally with your head&rsquo;s natural movements, thanks to earcups that swivel and tilt.</p>



<p>Comparing my 7X review unit against the Nova Pro for comfort, I have to say the 7X wins hands-down. Many midrange headsets do in fact, and it&rsquo;s one of the biggest things I&rsquo;d really like people to know when deciding between budget and premium gaming headsets.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>I had a field day savoring midrange sounds that usually fall by the wayside.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>If I got your attention with that last point, I&rsquo;m glad, because the 7X really got mine with its snug-fitting stretchy fabric headband and squishy AirWeave cushioning that felt lighter and more breathable than the Nova Pro&rsquo;s leatherette ones. The whole headset is also quite compact and reasonably light&mdash;it weighs just 323 grams (11.4 ounces).</p>



<p>The clamp force is much softer than the Nova Pro&rsquo;s, which I discovered was both good and bad. It&rsquo;s good in that there&rsquo;s an absence of any kind of tension or pressure. However, there is less passive noise isolation on offer, so you will occasionally cop an earful of lawn mower, but not often enough to be annoying.</p>



<p>For styling, the Arctis Nova 7X is a muted black color with matching SteelSeries logos on each can. My review unit also came with a splash of green in the headband to signify its Xbox compatibility. It looked perfectly at home next to my gaming rig. Although, at times I did wish I had some RGB to play with.</p>



<p>As for the controls, they&rsquo;re everything I was hoping for&mdash;simple, assessable, and plentiful. On the left you get a mute mic button and volume wheel, while over on the right there&rsquo;s a ChatMix Dial, on/off button, and Bluetooth button. These are all easy to locate&mdash;just a hand&rsquo;s reach away.</p>



<h3 id="steelseries-arctis-nova-7x-connectivity-and-battery">SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7X connectivity and battery</h3>



<p>As the 7X&rsquo;s green headband indicates, you get cross compatibility with Xbox One, Xbox X/S, and PC via a 2.4GHz low-latency Wi-Fi connection. However, the 7X is even more versatile than that, connecting to just about anything with a USB-C port&mdash;Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, Quest 2, and smartphone included. Plus, there&rsquo;s Bluetooth (more on that soon), and in the box you get a 3.55mm cable, so there are connectivity options galore.</p>

<p>Switching between USB and Xbox is as simple as flicking a switch on the USB-C dongle, so you can be up and running at the drop of a hat. The dongle is shaped like a mushroom instead of a stick, so if you&rsquo;re using it on a laptop, you&rsquo;ll want to attach it to the adapter supplied, otherwise some of your other ports may become blocked.</p>



<p>A gem in the Arctis Nova 7X&rsquo;s crown is the simultaneous Bluetooth functionality that lets you stream audio from your phone while also hearing every squeak of your gaming audio. I can&rsquo;t speak highly enough of this feature, which I prefer over less practical features like RGB lighting.</p>



<p>There must be a handful of reasons I used it when testing the 7X &ndash; taking work calls or calls from my spouse asking me to pick up milk etc etc&hellip; on my way home from the office being just two good ones. But by far the most fun was streaming my favorite blues album while playing a few rounds of Insurgency, which was a real hoot.</p>



<p>The 7X&rsquo;s battery life is also very decent. SteelSeries claims you get up to 38 hours of audio playback using the 2.4GHz wireless connection, or a respectable 26 hours of audio using simultaneous Bluetooth. When you do go flat, the cans can be juiced back up very quickly; 15 minutes fast charging with the USB-C to USB-A cable is all you need for an extra six hours audio.</p>



<h3><strong>SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7X audio performance</strong></h3>



<p>In a nutshell, the Arctis Nova 7X sounded great for gaming and listening to music on PC, where it conjured a rich and varied audio profile. I never noticed any distortion either &ndash; in fact, the 40 mm drivers were so consistently clear I found myself choosing it over a ton of other devices.</p>



<p>I tested the PC games <em>Metro Exodus</em>, <em>Insurgency</em> and <em>Gloria Victis</em>, and, after sinking a few hours into these titles the headset&rsquo;s strongest asset is definitely its mid-range tonal coverage, which sounds precise, full and vibrant. The bass and treble by comparison won&rsquo;t have you calling home to mama but won&rsquo;t disappoint either &ndash; they nicely accentuate the mids without dominating them.</p>



<p>Granted all that, I had a field day savoring mid-range sounds that usually fall by the wayside. In <em>Metro Exodus</em> the slithering of worms in the tunnels was even more of an ominous warning for what&rsquo;s up ahead than usual, while the clunking and grinding of the mechanisms were a satisfying reminder that I was heading in the right direction.</p>



<p>In <em>Metro Exodus</em> I also got a taste of the headset&rsquo;s 360 Degree Spatial Audio, which is fully compatible with Microsoft spatial audio. It worked a dream, wringing in sounds through all the directions of a compass wheel. I also enjoyed using the Parametric EQ tool in Sonar, part of the SteelSeries GG software app to highlight specific sounds. Accentuating the EQ parameters for voices allowed me to better eavesdrop on enemy conversations, which in turn helped me find my objectives more easily.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7X Wireless" class="wp-image-1787685" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/20230413_124423.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Soft AirWeave fabric on the cups and a flexible strechy headband up top &nbsp;provide a high level of comfort.&nbsp;</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>The clap of gunfire and the thud of explosions sounded precise and unmuffled in <em>Insurgency</em>. I could hear individual explosions as distinct &lsquo;&rsquo;kabooms&rsquo;&rsquo; and this really drew me further into the action. On the whole, the sound hitting my cups had a cinematic quality to it that made for a really immersive FPS experience. Reassuringly too, I never experienced any sudden amplitude drops or jumps.</p>



<p>Switching to <em>Gloria Victis</em> and I was very impressed by the clear, emotive strings in the orchestral launch music which had me rearing to get going on some raiding. Similarly, the 7X worked a charm playing smooth and melodious music like rock ballads, as judging by the warm acoustic guitar and soothing vocals in a few tracks by Aussie singer Pete Murray.</p>



<h3><strong>How does the SteelSereis Arctis Nova 7X compare to rivals</strong></h3>



<p>The Artcis Nova 7X sits in a similar category for functionality as wireless gaming headsets like the Nacon Rig Pro HX and the Logitech G733 Lightspeed. These are both great headsets in their own right, with decent sound and cross-compatibility. But put simply, the 7X is the more complete package, squirreling a few enticing bonuses away like its robust metal band and earcups and lengthy retractable noise cancelling microphone.</p>

<p>But the real sweetener is the simultaneous Bluetooth which neither of these two rivals can claim to have and which is an attribute I really go for in gaming headsets these days. The Arctis 7X has a retail price of $199.99 on the SteelSeries website, which admittedly is a little dearer than both of these rivals that each cost approximately $150 USD, but it&rsquo;s worth every dime for the extra functionality in my opinion.</p>



<h3><strong>Should I buy the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7X?</strong></h3>



<p>The leap between the Arctis Nova 7X and its big sibling, the Arctis Nova Pro, is a whopping $180&mdash;a gulf that made me wonder for a minute what I&rsquo;m getting and/or missing out on. My conclusion? I&rsquo;m not really missing much with the Nova 7X.</p>



<p>No, I won&rsquo;t get plush leatherette cups or a fancy base station, but I&rsquo;m still getting excellent sound, a tough and sturdy frame, gaming-friendly controls, respectable cross-compatibility and simultaneous Wi-Fi and Bluetooth functionality&mdash;all features that I want and will use. What&rsquo;s more, the Nova 7X is the more comfortable option in my opinion, which at the end of the day makes it a much more practical buy. </p>
