## Fast X - Official 'Who is Dante?' Behind the Scenes Clip (2023) Jason Momoa, Vin Diesel

Join members of the cast and crew of Fast X as they introduce you to the film's villain Dante (played by Jason Momoa). Fast X, the tenth film in the Fast & Furious saga, stars Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges, Jason Momoa, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jordana Brewster, John Cena, Jason Statham, Sung Kang, Alan Ritchson, Daniela Melchior, Scott Eastwood, with Helen Mirren, Charlize Theron, Brie Larson, and Rita Moreno.

Over many missions and against impossible odds, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his family have outsmarted, out-nerved and outdriven every foe in their path. Now, they confront the most lethal opponent they’ve ever faced: A terrifying threat emerging from the shadows of the past who’s fueled by blood revenge, and who is determined to shatter this family and destroy everything—and everyone—that Dom loves, forever. 

In 2011’s Fast Five, Dom and his crew took out nefarious Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes and decapitated his empire on a bridge in Rio De Janeiro. What they didn’t know was that Reyes’ son, Dante (Aquaman’s Jason Momoa), witnessed it all and has spent the last 12 years masterminding a plan to make Dom pay the ultimate price. 

Dante’s plot will scatter Dom’s family from Los Angeles to the catacombs of Rome, from Brazil to London and from Portugal to Antarctica. New allies will be forged and old enemies will resurface. But everything changes when Dom discovers that his own 8-year-old son (Leo Abelo Perry, Black-ish) is the ultimate target of Dante’s vengeance. 

Fast X is produced by Neal H. Moritz, Vin Diesel, Justin Lin, Jeff Kirschenbaum, and Samantha Vincent. The executive producers are Joseph M. Caracciolo, Jr., David Cain, Chris Morgan, Amanda Lewis, and Mark Bomback.

Fast X, directed by Louis Leterrier, opens in theaters on May 19, 2023.

## How Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 Became James Gunn’s Final MCU Film | The Story So Far

The Guardians of the Galaxy are gearing up one last time for Guardians of the Galaxy 3, a movie that will also serve as the MCU's farewell to director James Gunn. Guardians was the vehicle that thrust Gunn into big budget superhero movies, and now he's getting ready to re-launch DC's new slate of comic book movies after an up-and-down ride with Marvel and Disney. So how did Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 become James Gunn's final MCU film? Join us as we run down the whole saga. 

While not everything is known, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 will be a goodbye to one of the best Marvel teams. Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 will see the team: Groot (Vin Diesel), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Chris Pratt as Star-Lord, and more, with Zoe Saldana playing a different version of the character we got used to in the first 2 movies. 

While the Guardians of the Galaxy Soundtrack is usually pretty incredible, there aren’t many surefires beyond that for what will happen beyond that in Guardians of the Galaxy Vo. 3. The GotG story has been an interesting part of the MCU, and Director James Gunn’s story has been equally interesting all the while. We’re following his journey along with the Guardians as we prepare to face the GotG villain, what’s next for Drax, what’s next for Marvel Studios and Marvel Phase 5, and how we got here (hint: Baby Groot was a big part of it).

Before High Evolutionary time, let’s see who this band of misfits was before they face all the new antagonists including The High Evolutionary himself, Adam Warlock, and more. What’s it been like for Rocket Racoon all the way and how could his story conclude? Before we explore GotG vol 3 and who is High Evolutionary, we have to get the root of it all: who are the Guardians and what do they mean to the fans, Marvel, and their visionary director, James Gunn?

## How Dead Island 2 Was Brought Back From the Dead | IGN Inside Stories

Dead Island 2’s development cycle is infamous at this point. Initially revealed in 2014, its journey has been almost as treacherous as a runner trying to make it along Venice Beach in the midst of a zombie outbreak. Two studios tried to put a sequel together but were met with little more than a gory disaster. But while those projects died, hope did not. And so, the reins were handed to the team at Dambuster Studios.

Over the course of nine years and three developers, the long-awaited zombie-killing sequel has kept running (or walking) on. And now, it is finally at the finish line. This is the Inside Story of how Dead Island 2 was brought back from the dead.

See what else is on the way this season, including a look at a Nier Automata and Final Fantasy 7 in our IGN Inside Stories trailer: https://youtu.be/5PghgYKS3dE
