For many weeks she barely moved. Finally, when she was well enough to sit up, her doctors started the slow process of her rehabilitation by using a football. Maryna learned to balance on her prosthetic leg while using her good foot to kick the ball.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/28/andriy-shevchenko-ukraine-share-with-the-world-what-people-are-feeling">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Their new works may be their last, but the contribution these maestros are still making is invaluable to our world view</p><p>Two pronouncements this week from the world of culture might appear to strike a melancholy note: the film director Ken Loach <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/24/ken-loach-says-new-film-may-be-his-last-feature" title="">has declared</a> that The Old Oak, which is due to premiere at next month’s Cannes film festival, may be his last film, while the artist Frank Auerbach, who currently has two shows in the UK, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/25/frank-auerbach-artist-self-portraits-last-paintings" title="">has said</a> that he is in the process of making what may be his final paintings.</p><p>But turn those statements on their heads – with due consideration to the conditional “may” – and the picture changes to something worthy of celebration.

<p>Chris Pratt has fully grown into a hunky action-lead, but Dave Bautista’s beefy Drax is the scene stealer as he flexes his comedy chops</p><p>Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy franchise has now been going for almost a decade, long enough for its star Chris Pratt to have fully grown into his hunky action-lead image and leave behind the puppyish comedy turn from TV’s Parks and Recreation that got him hired in the first place. With Pratt’s lovable hero Quill addicted to 70s/80s hits on his vintage Walkman, the franchise has also gone on long enough to reportedly trigger a massive global sales upturn in audio cassettes, although it’s an iPod we see in this film. And it’s been with us long enough for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/15/james-gunn-guardians-of-the-galaxy-3">writer-director James Gunn to experience a complete cancelling-uncancelling cycle</a>, fired and then forgiven for offensive tweets.</p><p>Now Guardians of the Galaxy has reached the threequel stage: overlong, yes, and finally reaching for an importance and emotional closure (perhaps inspired by Gunn’s own emotional corporate redemption) that it doesn’t quite encompass, while leaving the GOTG brand open for a next-gen reboot. But it’s still spectacular, spirited and often funny. We find the Guardians in a state of emotional disarray, with Quill pining for Gamora (Zoe Saldana), who was killed in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/24/avengers-infinity-war-review-supremely-entertaining-showdown-in-the-grand-marvel-tradition">Avengers: Infinity War</a> but now exists as a time-travelled alt-self split from Quill and the group; she has no memory of their previous relationship and is now working with the Ravagers, led by Stakar Ogord (Sylvester Stallone).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/28/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3-review-james-gunns-fun-and-energetic-threequel">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The 1599 author on the difference between historians and novelists, looking at Shakespeare differently and hitchhiking to the Edinburgh festival to immerse himself in the bard’s work</p><p>• <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/27/james-shapiro-wins-baillie-gifford-anniversary-prize-with-extraordinary-shakespeare-biography-1599">James Shapiro wins Baillie Gifford anniversary prize with ‘extraordinary’ Shakespeare biography 1599</a></p><p>Serendipity dictated that the American writer and academic James Shapiro received the Baillie Gifford prize for nonfiction’s Winner of Winners award, given to celebrate its 25th year, at a ceremony in Edinburgh. In his teens and early 20s, Shapiro tells me as we talk over Zoom the morning after his victory, he would often hitchhike from London to the Edinburgh festival as part of his immersion in the plays of Shakespeare. This period in his life sowed the ground for his acclaimed book, 1599: A Year in the Life of William Shakespeare, first published in 2006. He was, he explains, recovering from the “awful experience” of studying the playwright in middle school; every summer for several years, he would save up enough money to come to the UK on a Freddie Laker plane, “where you could fly from New York to London for $100 round trip and sleep in church basements and for 50p see spectacular productions”.</p><p>In London, Stratford and Edinburgh, he’d see 25 plays in as many days, “and they’re all tattooed inside my skull to this day. The greatest one I saw was Richard Eyre’s Hamlet at the Royal Court in 1980 or so. Richard wrote me a note this morning, and it was so moving to me because that’s where it came from, seeing productions like his.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/28/baillie-gifford-winner-of-winners-james-shapiro-i-draw-a-very-sharp-line-between-fiction-and-nonfiction">Continue reading...</a>

<p>New rail strike dates underline anger felt at lowball offers and the widening gulf between workers and ministers</p><p>Of all the low moments in the long-running rail dispute, few have possibly been as dispiriting as the last 24 hours. After Network Rail and the RMT union reached agreement on a two-year deal in March, long-suffering passengers and workers might have assumed the truce was also leading to a wider settlement between train firms and their staff.</p><p>The subsequent calm, with no further strikes on the horizon, abruptly ended on Thursday when first the train drivers union Aslef and then the RMT <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/apr/27/rail-strikes-train-drivers-union-names-three-more-dates-may-june">announced fresh action</a>. Aslef’s move to three days of strikes and a week-long overtime ban is the union’s toughest single action yet, underlining the anger felt by drivers at a lowball offer with strings attached.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/apr/28/why-the-uk-rail-strike-truce-failed-to-foster-a-lasting-peace">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As the synthpop duo return for a new album and tour, they will answer your questions about their career</p><p>With their wayward yet wildly catchy synthpop, Soft Cell crafted one of the most thrilling sounds of the 80s. Hits like Tainted Love and Say Hello, Wave Goodbye have stood the test of time, but the band faded from the spotlight after their initial success. Now, as they prepare to release their fifth studio album, and the first in two decades, Marc Almond and Dave Ball will answer your questions – post them in the comments below.</p><p>After growing up in separate northern seaside towns, the pair first met as students at Leeds Polytechnic in 1977, when Almond asked Ball to soundtrack his provocative performance art. After a string of experimental covers and local shows, the duo put together their debut EP Mutant Moments at the turn of the decade, using a simple two-track recorder. But it was the release of their sleazy revamp of Gloria Jones’s Tainted Love in 1981 that propelled Soft Cell from underground misfits to mainstream success. The track became the biggest single of the year in the UK and its 43 consecutive weeks on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart set a new record.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/28/post-your-questions-for-soft-cell">Continue reading...</a>

But is it really so complicated to classify Carlson’s political ideology?</p><p>In late February 2022, then Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson, in the face of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, began a <a href="https://twitter.com/Acyn/status/1496290844797992960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1496290844797992960%7Ctwgr%5E5d2be7eb0cd217bb85030710de9922aedf43af79%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fmedia%2F2022%2F02%2F23%2Ftucker-carlson-putin-russia-ukraine%2F">pro-Russia monologue</a> urging his audience to ask themselves the question: “Why do I hate Putin so much?” The gist of Carlson’s comments about Russia’s leader is that Putin should not be regarded as an enemy. Instead, the <em>real </em>enemies of America are those who call white Americans racist, those who teach so-called critical race theory in schools, business elites who ship jobs abroad, and those who imposed Covid lockdowns on the United States.</p><p>… It is time to turn from our quarrels and to build our White ramparts again. This alliance with foreign races means nothing but death to us. It is our turn to guard our heritage from Mongol and Persian and Moor, before we become engulfed in a limitless foreign sea. Our civilization depends on a united strength among ourselves; on strength too great for foreign enemies to challenge; on a Western Wall of race and arms which can hold back either a Genghis Khan or the infiltration of inferior blood; on an English fleet, a German air force, a French army, an American nation, standing together as guardians of our common heritage, sharing strength, dividing influence.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/28/tucker-carlson-politics-fascism">Continue reading...</a>

On Thursday, former vice-president <strong>Mike Pence</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/27/mike-pence-testifies-donald-trump-january-6">appeared before the grand jury</a> empaneled by special counsel <strong>Jack Smith </strong>to consider charges against <strong>Donald Trump</strong> over the January 6 insurrection. The possibility that Trump could face a federal indictment over the attack, as well as his involvement in plots to stop <strong>Joe Biden</strong> from taking office and the classified materials found at Mar-a-Lago, is a major unknown in the presidential race, particularly since polls show Trump as the most popular Republican candidate. There’s no saying when Smith could make his charging recommendation, but Pence’s testimony is a reminder that the investigation remains a real threat to the former president.</p><p>Here’s what’s going on today:</p><p><strong>House Democratic leadership </strong>will hold their weekly press conference at 10.30am eastern time. Expect plenty of railing against <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/26/us-house-debt-ceiling-bill-passed-kevin-mccarthy">the debt limit proposal</a> Republicans passed earlier this week.</p><p><strong>Joe Biden </strong>is keeping it low key, presenting the Commander-in-Chief’s trophy to the Air Force Falcons, champions of last year’s Armed Forces Bowl, at 2.30pm, then heading to a Democratic fundraiser in the evening.</p><p><strong>Joe Manchin</strong>, the conservative Democrat representing deep-red West Virginia, yesterday afternoon again called on Biden to negotiate with Republican House speaker <strong>Kevin McCarthy</strong> on an agreement to raise the debt limit.

<p>My baby is a pub regular, but sometimes I just want to be around adults – the parent v child-free divide is starker online than off</p><p>This morning I did something that I rarely do, for fear of inducing a full-body cringe the likes of which I have not experienced since, aged 10, I jumped on my dad’s back in the local swimming pool only to discover that it wasn’t him: I read one of my <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/24/child-free-pubs-cafes">old columns</a>. Written nearly a decade ago under the headline “I’ll drink to child-free pubs and cafes”, my twentysomething self grumbles about the presence of kids in adult spaces.</p><p>Fast forward and I have a one-year-old who regards my local pub as an extension of his living room. I have sung him to sleep in the beer garden and breastfed him, rosé in hand, while sharing birth stories. Sometimes, I have looked up and seen an exclusion zone of empty tables around where we are sitting. Time makes hypocrites of us all.</p><p>Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/28/child-free-spaces-mother-baby-adults-parent">Continue reading...</a>

In recent weeks we’ve had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/11/ai-generated-news-presenter-debuts-in-kuwait-media">AI newsreaders</a> on Kuwaiti TV, an AI-generated photograph <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/17/photographer-admits-prize-winning-image-was-ai-generated">winning a major prize</a>, an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/apr/20/schumacher-family-planning-legal-action-over-ai-interview-with-f1-great">AI-generated interview with Michael Schumacher</a> that got an editor sacked and, of course, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/03895dc4-a3b7-481e-95cc-336a524f2ac2">numerous warnings</a> that this all might spell the end of humanity itself.</p><p>It’s natural to feel apprehensive about these society-shaking developments.

Even so, the reaction to a recent interview in which Joe Russo <a href="https://collider.com/joe-russo-donald-mustard-gaming-storytelling-fortnight-interview/">speculated on the future of AI-generated film</a> seemed particularly intense. Russo – one half of Marvel-affiliated director duo the Russo brothers – was musing on how generative AI could invent a film catered to the whims of the viewer. Here’s his pitch:</p><p>You could walk into your house and say to the AI on your streaming platform, “Hey, I want a movie starring my photoreal avatar and Marilyn Monroe’s photoreal avatar. I want it to be a rom-com because I’ve had a rough day,” and it renders a very competent story with dialogue that mimics your voice … suddenly now you have a rom-com starring you that’s 90 minutes long.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/apr/28/the-guide-ai-film-joe-russo">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The kind of food you pause halfway through eating so you can text friends about it</p><p><a href="https://khaikhai.co.uk/">Khai Khai</a> in Newcastle, with its smoke-enhanced Indian small plates menu, has remained persistently on my list of places to go for more than 18 months, simply because people keep telling me about it. Strong word of mouth is really as good as it gets when choosing where to eat out these days.</p><p>There’s so much to quibble about right now: brief opening hours, wild prices, staffing issues, as well as a host of London openings so soulless and unwelcoming that their investors, possibly registered in the Cayman Islands for tax purposes, must be rather alarmed. So, when somewhere such as Khai Khai turns up, featuring a large scoop of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/sep/07/four-classic-indian-recipes-dishoom-chaat-dal-salad-jackfruit-biyani-chicken-makhani-curry">Dishoom</a>-style, broad-based likability, it’s genuinely exciting. There’s a large chunk of the familiar on offer here – lamb bhuna, biryani, vindaloo, rotis, kheema naan and so on – but there’s also a lot that will seem mysterious to some diners: <em>kheema pav</em>, say (minted spiced lamb mince and peas in bread), or beetroot <em>shikampuri</em>, which come stuffed with hung yoghurt. The breakfast menu, served from 9-11.30am, features masala mash with pooris (deep-fried bread with potato curry) and <em>akuri</em> toast (onion, tomato and ginger scrambled eggs). “It’s not food, it’s heritage,” it says on the menu.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/apr/28/khai-khai-newcastle-restaurant-review-grace-dent">Continue reading...</a>

## Nixed nuptials, Fox in trouble and 'erratic' behaviour … Is Rupert Murdoch OK? | Marina Hyde

<p>In the grand tradition of his newspapers lasering in on public figures at their lowest moments, we really deserve to know</p><p>On Page 3 of the Sun, I once saw the central i of the word “tit” asterisked out, not four inches away from a topless pair of the genuine article. So there’s always been a ludicrous coyness to Rupert Murdoch and his many works. But surely we are not really to believe that the media mogul this week ditched his highest-rating news anchor, Tucker Carlson, for referring to a woman as a “cunt” in an email? This is the take of the Wall Street Journal – proprietor: Mr R Murdoch – which explains: “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tucker-carlsons-vulgar-offensive-messages-about-colleagues-helped-seal-his-fate-at-fox-news-e52b3cc5">Tucker Carlson’s Vulgar, Offensive Messages About Colleagues Helped Seal His Fate At Fox News</a>”.</p><p>Righto. It’s fair to say the Wall Street Journal is not alone in the quest to make sense of Murdoch’s recent behaviour. The week after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/19/dominion-lawsuit-rupert-murdoch-testify">he paid $787.5m</a> to settle the lawsuit brought against Fox News by Dominion Voting Systems – Dominion’s lawyers were going to force him to take the stand – Murdoch sacked Carlson via his son Lachlan. Media outlets have been scrambling to find logical explanations for actions that arguably, to deploy a euphemism, defy logic. After all, this is a 92-year-old who only weeks ago was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/24/lies-fox-news-rupert-murdoch-married-election">delighting us</a> with news of his impending fifth marriage – a whirlwind engagement to a former dental nurse turned prison chaplain, which was hastily called off a mere fortnight later. Apparently, Murdoch had become “increasingly uncomfortable” with his fiancee’s “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/apr/08/rupert-murdoch-engagement-succession">outspoken evangelical views</a>”.

They were a Championship side and he thought they were a stepping-stone club. He soon realised he was wrong. On Wednesday night Brentford <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/26/chelsea-brentford-premier-league-match-report">went to Chelsea and won</a> 2-0. They are ninth in the Premier League before hosting Nottingham Forest on Saturday and have a chance of qualifying for Europe.</p><p>Brentford know how to maximise their resources. They did not panic when Smith went to Villa in 2018. Thomas Frank was an inspired appointment. The Dane led Brentford into the top flight in 2021 and has built a young, hungry side. Brentford flourished after winning promotion and have kept standards high this season. “They say the second season’s the hardest,” Henry says. “But we’ve stayed together. The gaffer said: ‘Don’t take your foot off the pedal.’</p><p>What we have instead here is planned, targeted, brilliantly enacted success. Pep Guardiola is the best manager in the world. Therefore we will buy not just Pep Guardiola, but the conditions that make Pep Guardiola work, an entire Pep Guardiola habitat. We will buy the strongest squad. There will be no variables here, just billionaire-backed certainties, aided by the stunning good fortune that this vision is shared by such far-sighted companies as Etisalat, Etihad Airways, Abu Dhabi Bank and others.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2023/apr/28/premier-league-relegation-fears-grow-before-six-pointers-football-news-live">Continue reading...</a>

## Brentford’s Rico Henry: ‘Teams said I was too timid, not big enough. It gave me more fire’

<p>The left-back talks childhood rejections, the hurt at not getting an England call-up and why more dark arts would benefit the Bees</p><p>“It’s heartbreaking,” Rico Henry says as he thinks back to his childhood and remembers trials ending with clubs telling him he was too short to become a footballer. “Especially when you’re young. You can’t do anything about it. But I sort of knew it would work out. I had a lot of pace. I looked up to left-backs like Jordi Alba, who’s short. Marcelo and Ashley Cole weren’t the tallest. I always believed in myself. I knew there were other players in the same position who were a similar height to me.”</p><p>Brentford’s 5ft 7in left-back laughs and says being rejected by Aston Villa, Birmingham and West Brom spurred him on. “I was 11, 12 years old but teams were saying I was too timid and not big enough,” Henry says. “It gave me more fire. You’ve got to learn from it. You can’t get too down. You’ve got to keep going. I think maybe the way I played, going into tackles, I was probably not as aggressive as I could have been. I learned as I got older to be more aggressive in certain situations. It was hard but I got through it.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/28/brentford-rico-henry-too-timid-not-big-enough-more-fire-interview">Continue reading...</a>

<p>At 88, I often get ignored when I first walk into comedy clubs. People assume I’m in the wrong place and are shocked to find out I’m on the bill</p><p>I was 68 when I first stepped on stage as a standup comedian in 2003. I’d never set foot in a comedy club before. I’ve always been a performer – I’ve worked as a singer, actor and musician – but all that came to an end after 9/11. I live in New York, and we watched the twin towers fall from my apartment building. For a year afterwards, nobody wanted to go out or be entertained.</p><p>It was then that I started to think about comedy. I realised people needed to laugh, to enjoy themselves again, and thought that with a little training I could do it. I took a few classes, tried to work out a routine, and finally plucked up the courage to get up on stage. That first time was terrifying. I had no idea what the audience would make of me.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/28/experience-at-88-im-the-worlds-oldest-female-standup-comedian">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The novelist on South Korean tales, discovering Dostoevsky, and the comfort of nature books</p><p><strong>My earliest reading memory</strong><br />When I was a child, my father, a young and poor novelist, kept our unfurnished house packed with books. A deluge spilled out from the shelves, covering the floor in disorderly towers like a secondhand bookstore where the organising had been put off for ever. To me, books were half-living beings that constantly multiplied and expanded their boundaries. Despite the frequent moves, I could feel at ease thanks to all those books protecting me. Before I made friends in a strange neighbourhood, I had my books with me every afternoon.</p><p><strong>My favourite book growing up</strong><br />What I read in my early childhood were children’s books by Korean writers such as Kang So-cheon or Ma Hae-song. I remember being mesmerised by the story of a photo studio that printed pictures of people’s dreams. And the image of a child feeling sorry for the trees sleeping standing up at night and singing: “Oh tree, oh tree, lie down and sleep.” A particularly unforgettable translated children’s book is The Brothers Lionheart by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/03/astrid-lindgren-woman-behind-pippi-longstocking-jens-andersen-review" title="">Astrid Lindgren</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/28/han-kang-one-year-i-couldnt-bear-fiction-and-read-astrophysics-instead">Continue reading...</a>

## Susanne Sundfør: Blómi review – timelessly classic songwriting

<p><strong>(Bella Union)</strong><br />Ignore the baffling spoken word bookends and focus on the spectacular songwriting, as the Norwegian star harks back to the likes of Laura Nyro and Carole King</p><p>The romance and life force of 1970s singer-songwriters such as Joni Mitchell, Laura Nyro and Carole King – as well as their burned-fingers wisdom – are embodied here by Susanne Sundfør, one of Norway’s most successful singers who continues to evolve her craft upwards from her earlier synthwave and pop-folk.</p><p>There’s also a touch of Disney or musical theatre to the way ballads such as Ashera’s Song and Rūnā search out their next cadences; the latter has the same tentative-then-certain feeling as Leonard Cohen’s Hallelujah but done with a Julie Andrews-ish positivity. You may need to re-notch your threshold for corniness.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/28/susanne-sundfor-blomi-review">Continue reading...</a>

## Peter Pan & Wendy review – Jude Law has fun in a so-so reinvention

<p>The actor’s full-throated performance as Captain Hook is the most distinctive thing in a passable but unnecessary Disney live-action remake</p><p>The increasingly rotten trend of turning classic Disney animations into wretched live-action, or photorealistic, remakes looks set to reach its nadir with next month’s release of The Little Mermaid, already <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/mjs538/little-mermaid-character-reveals">a viral nightmare</a> for its horrifying confirmation that adding lips to both a crab and a fish is indeed a crime against humanity. Its looming ugliness does at least help to make this month’s far more hushed release of the inoffensively fine Peter Pan &amp; Wendy seem dreamy in comparison.</p><p>It almost seems foolish at this stage to question the necessity of such a thing, given the crushing commercial inevitability of it, but it’s impossible to watch yet another take on JM Barrie’s impish hero without wondering why we’re here once again. Unlike so many of Disney’s other remakes, the story of Peter Pan has also been told elsewhere on an apparent loop since the studio’s 1953 animated adventure. Within the last 20 years alone, PJ Hogan had a go with 2003’s Peter Pan (a major, almost $100m-losing flop), Joe Wright tried again in 2015 with the more radical Pan (another massive failure, this time rumoured to have cost the studio almost $150m), Benh Zeitlin went even more radical with the underwhelming Wendy in 2020 and, with far less fanfare, we’ve also seen 2011’s Syfy series Neverland, a much-ridiculed 2014 live retelling on NBC, 2020’s semi-homage Come Away with Angelina Jolie and 2022’s little-seen The Lost Girls. It’s been a bombardment especially given how so many of them have been, ahem, panned.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/28/peter-pan-wendy-review-disney-plus-jude-law">Continue reading...</a>

There were not many personnel changes in January; teenage striker Jhon Durán was signed from Chicago Fire, Bertrand Traoré was recalled from loan at Istanbul Basaksehir and, most importantly, Alex Moreno joined from Real Betis. Lucas Digne has been deposed from the defence and Villa have only lost twice in Moreno’s 15 appearances, with the Spaniard quickly becoming integral to the system. He is popular off the pitch too, ingratiating himself with fans with a recent interview in English, smiling throughout despite not yet having a full mastery of the language. Moreno will enjoy the prospect of facing Antony, which will be a key battle with the Villa man keen to test the Brazilian’s defence as well as attack. <strong>Will Unwin</strong></p><p><em>Manchester United v Aston Villa, Sunday 2pm (all times BST)</em></p><p><em>Leicester v Everton, Monday 8pm</em></p><p><em>Bournemouth v Leeds, Sunday 2pm</em></p><p><em>Newcastle v Southampton, Sunday 2pm</em></p><p><em>Brentford v Nottingham Forest, Saturday 3pm</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/apr/28/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend">Continue reading...</a>

It helps if they had scandalous personal lives (Rimbaud and Verlaine in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114702/">Total Eclipse</a>, Dylan Thomas in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3300874/">Last Call</a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0819714/">The Edge of Love</a>).

But he regarded himself first and foremost as a poet, memorably declaring that “prose books are the show dogs I breed and sell to support my cat” – a line that William Nunez, writer-director of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1677615/">The Laureate</a>, reluctantly had to excise from his script because none of the show dogs had yet been born in the years he chose to cover.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/28/menage-a-quatre-why-most-poetic-biopics-are-romantic-fiction">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>29 April 1895</strong>: Constantly drinking can cause uncomfortable heat while riding, plus tips on hill climbing and using a hairpin for small repairs</p><p>Many cyclists, especially beginners, are troubled by a tendency to get exceedingly hot when riding. This is, of course, usually a sign of want of condition, and will disappear when the rider gets into form. Sometimes, however, it remains, and this generally means that the cyclist has got into the bad habit of constantly drinking, than which nothing is more calculated to cause uncomfortable heat. It is in the beginning that this tendency should be overcome. The novice should resist the temptation to take liquids while riding, and, if possible, the annoying general thirst that will probably afflict him during the first weeks of his cycling, moving him to get up in the night and empty half his water-jug.</p><p>There is no necessity to go to extremes, however. I knew a beginner who was so determined to get into form quickly that he gave up nearly every sort of liquid, and inflicted unnecessary tortures on himself by reducing all drink to three-quarters of a pint in the 24 hours in summer, and at a time when he was cycling constantly. The limitation had no ill-effects – on the contrary, that cyclist is to-day absolutely impervious to thirst, – but a reasonable amount of restraint would suit most riders better. It is certain that no one who gives way to this habit of cultivating a seven-and-sixpenny thirst every time he goes out for a ride will ever become a really proficient cyclist.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/28/cycling-resist-the-temptation-to-take-liquids-1895">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A sea anemone found off Japan does not just live on a species of crab, but actually grows its host’s shell like a home extension</p><p>Deep in the Kumano Sea off the south-eastern coast of Japan, hermit crabs crawl around sporting what look like pearly pink flowers on their shells. But these are not floral arrangements – they are members of a newly discovered species of sea anemone, <em>Stylobates calcifer</em>, which live on the hermit crabs’ shells.</p><p>This kind of sea anemone and hermit crab cohabitation is not unique: dozens of anemone species live exclusively with hermit crabs.

<p>Ari Aster’s divisive psychodrama Beau Is Afraid is a minute shy of three hours, the latest in a string of extended cinema sits</p><p>It might be tempting to call Ari Aster’s new movie Beau Is Afraid a therapy session. It clearly addresses the writer-director’s parental anxieties, allowing him to vent and visualize a series of dreams-turned-nightmares related to guilt, repression and inherited trauma. (It is an A24 sort-of horror movie, after all.) But ultimately, describing Beau as therapy would be inaccurate, or at least incomplete: therapy sessions are rarely this long.</p><p>Including its end credits (which technically run over the lingering final scene of the film), Aster’s movie lasts for two hours and 59 minutes, a runtime that seems like the result of a contractual obligation, or possibly a bet. Someone must have told Aster his movie couldn’t go over three hours. For better or worse, Beau Is Afraid feels like the type of movie that, lacking that kind of specific limitation, could easily last forever.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/28/beau-is-afraid-runtime-long-movies">Continue reading...</a>
