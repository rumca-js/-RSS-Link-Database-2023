  <p id="luqb62"><em>Vampire Survivors</em>, one of the breakout games of 2022, is being turned into an animated television show. The show seems to be very early in production (it doesn’t yet have a writer and will be shopped around, <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/04/vampire-survivors-video-game-animated-television-series-story-kitchen-luca-galante-poncle-trailer-1235340337/"><em>Deadline</em> reports</a>), but I’m intrigued to see how the game will be adapted into a TV series.</p>
<p id="OaJEtG">There’s no real plot in <em>Vampire Survivors.</em> The point of the game is to live for as long as you can against increasingly large waves of monsters while leveling up various weapons and items until you become so outrageously powerful that you can walk away from the game and still survive. (Maybe that’s just how I play it.) Also, there are lots of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/19/22941145/vampire-survivors-early-access-steam-pc-mac-luca-galante">pretty lights and colors</a>.</p>
<p id="E9bqZg">There is an official setting for the web version of the game on <a href="https://poncle.itch.io/vampire-survivors">its Itch.io...</a></p>

## How to transfer your Google Authenticator 2FA to a new phone

  <p id="fpM5Ry">Two-factor authentication (2FA) is one of the best and easiest ways to keep your online accounts secure. It works by issuing an authentication code on your phone when somebody tries to access the account; if that person doesn’t have the code, they (or you) don’t get in. By using a 2FA app, such as Google Authenticator or Authy, you can prevent somebody from accessing your data by getting your password. (You can have a code texted to you, but that is considered far less secure <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/11/18564381/community-hacking-sim-hijacking-cryptocurrency">due to the rise of so-called SIM hacking</a>.)</p>
<p id="ag7DRC">Google Authenticator lets you establish 2FA by using your phone to scan a QR code generated by the app on a separate device or by entering a key code. It’s a relatively easy process.</p>

  <p id="yVxBz4">The current AI boom, from Bing and Midjourney, relies on free access to training data, much of it scraped from the web and often protected by copyright. The use of this data has led to both criticism and lawsuits, particularly in the art world, with rights owners arguing that their work is being exploited without their permission.</p>
<p id="Dlc3gx">Some of the AI world’s biggest players, like OpenAI, have avoided scrutiny by simply refusing to detail the data used to create their software. But legislation proposed in the EU to regulate AI (the long-building and far-reaching AI Act) could force companies to disclose this information, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/eu-lawmakers-committee-reaches-deal-artificial-intelligence-act-2023-04-27">reports from <em>Reuters</em></a> <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/artificial-intelligence/news/ai-act-meps-close-in-on-rules-for-general-purpose-ai-foundation-models/">and <em>Euractiv</em></a>.</p>

As pointed out by developer and Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/vitor_dlucca/status/1651692930464362496">Vitor de Lucca</a>, a new developer version of Edge will now display a new Bing ad next to the Google Bard URL.</p>
<p id="iKjLkM">When pointing Edge to <a href="http://bard.google.com">bard.google.com</a>, a new animated “compare answers with the AI-powered new Bing” slide appears in the upper-right side of Edge’s address bar. Then, the text slides back to the right and leaves behind a Bing icon that seems pretty redundant considering a similar icon is off to the right by default.</p>

It inserts adorable animal characters into an increasingly harrowing world, where the skin of civilization is being pulled back by the nails of abnormality. This is a world unmade by a respiratory disease, while simultaneously reeling from the sudden births of hybrid children: half-human, half-animal. Amid this chaos, we meet the titular sweet tooth, Gus (Christian Convery), a half-deer boy. Raised in isolation in Yellowstone National Park, Gus found himself alone and hunted. With the help of a reluctant protector, Tommy Jepperd (Nonso Anozie), a mountain of a man carrying an equal amount of weight on his shoulders, and a terrifying teen named Bear (Stefania LaVie Owen), Gus journeys...</p>

<p id="foOCZ2">The vulnerability revolves around mail keys, which are meant to allow users to log into AT&amp;T email accounts via clients like Outlook or Thunderbird.

  <p id="WBQWaK">Valve has <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/3686801719529689368">just shipped</a> a huge UI overhaul to Steam’s In-Game Overlay in the Steam Beta, among other fresh coats of paint. It also comes with one particularly awesome idea: a traveling notepad.  </p>
<p id="z7wfbs">Yes, you’ve probably already got a notepad app on your PC, but does yours automatically pop up the correct file that corresponds to each game you play? Can you overlay it on top of your game so it’s visible while you play? Does it automatically sync from PC to PC via the cloud? Valve says its new Notes app does all of that, and works offline too. </p>
