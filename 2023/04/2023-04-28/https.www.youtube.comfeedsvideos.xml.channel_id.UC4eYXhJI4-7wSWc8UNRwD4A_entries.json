Opening with gentle vocals and simple chords on \u201cPendant,\u201d Cuco brought corazon from an earlier era to his concert. Closing out the emo moment with a sweet guitar solo, he moved on to the tranquil percussion of \u201cHydrocodone,\u201d delivering heartbroken melody and transporting the audience back to the bedroom where his songwriting career first began. \n\nComplementing the rumbling bass with some light synth, he showcases that same soulful energy on \u201cFeelings,\u201d and closes out the set with the bumpy, bilingual new track \u201cUnder the Sun,\u201d shifting to cumbia rhythms as he swaps languages. The guitar-heavy, percussive-laden show invites the audience to share in a Cuco we\u2019ve never seen before, all parts heartbroken, hopeful, and evolving.\n\nSET LIST\n\u201cPendant\u201d\n\u201cHydrocodone\u201d\n\u201cFeelings\u201d\n\u201cUnder the Sun\u201d \n\nMUSICIANS\nCuco: vocals, guitar, keys\nEsai: bass, vocals\nFern: guitar, vocals\nAllan Olivares: guitar, percussion, vocals \nJulian Farias: drums\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducers: Bobby Carter, Felix Contreras\nDirector/Editor: Kara Frame\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nCreative Director: Bob Boilen\nVideographers:  Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Sofia Seidel\nAudio Assistant: Neil Tevault \nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Maia Stern, Marissa Lorusso, Hazel Cills, Ashley Pointer, Pilar Galv\u00e1n, Jill Britton\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #nprmusic #cuco", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy-4I58Dru0", "date_published": "2023-04-28 09:00:35+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
