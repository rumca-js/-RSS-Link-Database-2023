Even with this asterisk - and I can't stress enough how significant it is - Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is a must-play experience for fans of the first game. It doesn't rewrite the rules so much as massively build upon, improve and expand on the formula in numerous ways. It offers a human story about home, family and moving on while presenting a likeable cast and memorable locations.

Where the series goes from here is anyone's guess. I'm not just excited for what's next, but keen to return and immerse myself in Jedi: Survivor's worlds even further.
