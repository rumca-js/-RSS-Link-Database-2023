<p>More media outlets are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cnet-corrected-41-of-its-77-ai-written-articles-201519489.html">using AI to write articles</a>, if not as aggressively as others. <em>VentureBeat</em> editorial director Michale Nu√±ez <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-04-28/ai-in-news-reporting-a-test-is-coming-for-journalism-ethics?sref=10lNAhZ9">tells</a><em>Bloomberg</em> his publication is using Microsoft's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-new-bing-edge-ai-copilot-hands-on-demo-test-chatgpt-openai-213332455.html">Bing Chat</a> to help edit and write stories. Reporters are encouraged to slip AI-written &quot;sentences and fragments&quot; into articles so long as they're accurate and independently verifiable.</p><p>The OpenAI-powered tech is akin to having &quot;another person on the team,&quot; Nu√±ez says. It theoretically summarizes content in seconds instead of hours. <em>VentureBeat</em> doesn't disclose the use of AI content provided it's limited and authentic, but also doesn't intend to create whole articles using the technology.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Word surfaced in January that <em>CNET</em> had been using AI to produce entire financial explainer articles since November. Although characterized as a trial, over half of the articles required at least minor corrections. Some effectively plagiarized their sources. It also wasn't clear that algorithms had produced the pieces.</p><p>Generative AI like Bing Chat, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chatgpt-is-suddenly-everywhere-are-we-ready-180031821.html">ChatGPT</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-bard-ai-hands-on-a-work-in-progress-with-plenty-of-caveats-170956025.html">Google Bard</a> has become increasingly popular as a creative tool, for search results and even for entertainment. However, there are ethical concerns that include plagiarism, basic accuracy and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chatgpt-openai-new-york-city-public-schools-ban-192608080.html">cheating</a>. There are also questions of trust ‚Äî should creators disclose uses of AI, even if it's minor and undetectable? While the broader news industry isn't expected to completely replace human writers, there are worries AI might be used to reduce the need for real people.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/venturebeat-is-the-latest-publication-to-use-ai-in-its-articles-202514471.html?src=rss

## ChatGPT is once again available in Italy after a temporary ban

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/openai/"><ins>OpenAI</ins></a> says <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/chatgpt/"><ins>ChatGPT</ins></a> is once again available in Italy after it addressed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-italian-data-protection-agency-gives-openai-a-chance-to-avoid-being-banned-185638918.html"><ins>a series of conditions set out by regulators</ins></a>. The Garante data protection authority wanted OpenAI to resolve several issues by the end of this month in order to lift a temporary ban on the chatbot.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúChatGPT is available again to our users in Italy,‚Äù OpenAI told the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/chatgpt-openai-data-privacy-italy-b9ab3d12f2b2cfe493237fd2b9675e21"><em><ins>Associated Press</ins></em></a> in a statement. ‚ÄúWe are excited to welcome them back, and we remain dedicated to protecting their privacy.‚Äù</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="81c6f4bdae0f4b81bc77ce0ed6233f0b"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">we‚Äôre excited chatgpt is available in üáÆüáπ again!</p>‚Äî Sam Altman (@sama) <a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1652006977734836224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 28, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>Italian regulators <a href="https://www.engadget.com/italy-to-block-chatgpt-over-data-protection-issues-134922771.html"><ins>blocked ChatGPT in March</ins></a> over concerns that the AI's training methods and chatbot violated the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Officials ordered OpenAI to stop processing the personal information of users in the country while they looked into a potential data breach.</p><p>Earlier this month, the Garante told OpenAI to make sure there was a privacy disclosure on the website that details how data is collected and used to train ChatGPT's algorithms. The watchdog also directed the company to offer a form through which EU users could object to having their data used for training purposes and to add an age verification system.</p><p>OpenAI <a href="https://www.engadget.com/openai-improves-chatgpt-privacy-with-new-data-controls-174851274.html">added privacy controls to ChatGPT</a> this week. Among other things, the settings allow users to switch off their chat histories, which stops OpenAI from using that data <a href="https://www.engadget.com/three-samsung-employees-reportedly-leaked-sensitive-data-to-chatgpt-190221114.html"><ins>for training purposes</ins></a>. According to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/28/chatgpt-resumes-in-italy/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a><em>, </em>users in Italy are now seeing a pop-up that asks them to confirm they are aged at least 18 or, if they're between 13 and 17, that they have a parent's or guardian's consent to use ChatGPT.</p><p>Italy's data protection authority <a href="https://www.gpdp.it/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9881490#english"><ins>said in a statement</ins></a> that it &quot;welcomes the measures OpenAI implemented,&quot; though it urged the company to follow through on other demands that the Garante has made. &quot;This applies in particular to implementing an age verification system and planning and conducting an information campaign to inform Italians of what happened as well as of their right to opt-out from the processing of their personal data for training algorithms.&quot;</p><p>The watchdog added that it hopes OpenAI will keep up efforts to comply with the GDPR and suggested it will be keeping an eye on ChatGPT. &quot;The Italian [supervisory authority] will carry on its fact-finding activities regarding OpenAI also under the umbrella of the ad-hoc task force that was set up by the European Data Protection Board,&quot; the statement concluded.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/chatgpt-is-once-again-available-in-italy-after-a-temporary-ban-195716663.html?src=rss

## Venmo now lets you send crypto to other users for some reason

<p>Paypal-owned money transfer service Venmo dipped its toes into cryptocurrencies in 2021 after opening up an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/venmo-crypto-trading-app-100001103.html"><ins>in-app trading platform.</ins></a> That was just for individuals to buy or sell crypto. Now, the company is going further into the once-heralded digital currency space by allowing users to <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2023-04-28-Introducing-Crypto-Transfers-for-Venmo-Customers"><ins>send crypto directly</ins></a> to other Venmo customers.</p><p>This looks to be Venmo‚Äôs attempt to simplify the often-confusing task of sending crypto to other people. To that end, the company says this feat is easily accomplished in a ‚Äúfew simple steps.‚Äù Just head to the Crypto tab, tap the transfer arrow and follow the prompts. Venmo‚Äôs new platform also lets you send currency to Paypal handles and any external crypto wallet. You can also tap Receive to display a QR code that‚Äôs embedded with your unique crypto address.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This does seem much easier than rival platforms, but this is crypto, so there is a major caveat. These transfers are not protected in any way, shape or form. They cannot be canceled or reversed, so triple-check the Venmo handle or wallet address before slapping that send button. Once it‚Äôs gone, it‚Äôs gone.</p><p>More details on the <a href="https://help.venmo.com/hc/en-us/articles/16145303480595"><ins>actual transfer process are found here</ins></a> and Venmo says the update will begin rolling out to users in the next week, but this is a tiered update, so it could be until the end of May before everyone has access to the feature. This tool will not be available in Hawaii and New York and it only pertains to cryptocurrencies available for purchase on Venmo, like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash.</p><p>Despite the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-morning-after-the-world-of-cryptocurrency-continues-to-wobble-111526550.html">public‚Äôs love affair with crypto starting to cool down</a>, Venmo says that its trading platform has seen steady growth.

## US lawmakers introduce bill to prevent AI-controlled nuclear launches

<p>Bipartisan US lawmakers from both chambers of Congress <a href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/markey-lieu-beyer-and-buck-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-prevent-ai-from-launching-a-nuclear-weapon">introduced legislation</a> this week that would formally prohibit AI from launching nuclear weapons. Although Department of Defense policy already <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2022/Oct/27/2003103845/-1/-1/1/2022-NATIONAL-DEFENSE-STRATEGY-NPR-MDR.PDF">states</a> that a human must be ‚Äúin the loop‚Äù for such critical decisions, the new bill ‚Äî the Block Nuclear Launch by Autonomous Artificial Intelligence Act ‚Äî would codify that policy, preventing the use of federal funds for an automated nuclear launch without ‚Äúmeaningful human control.‚Äù</p><p>Aiming to protect ‚Äúfuture generations from potentially devastating consequences,‚Äù the bill was introduced by Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) and Representatives Ted Lieu (D-MA), Don Beyer (D-VA) and Ken Buck (R-CO). Senate co-sponsors include Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). ‚ÄúAs we live in an increasingly digital age, we need to ensure that humans hold the power alone to command, control, and launch nuclear weapons ‚Äì not robots,‚Äù said Markey. ‚ÄúThat is why I am proud to introduce the Block Nuclear Launch by Autonomous Artificial Intelligence Act. We need to keep humans in the loop on making life or death decisions to use deadly force, especially for our most dangerous weapons.‚Äù</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Artificial intelligence chatbots (like the ever-popular <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chatgpt-is-suddenly-everywhere-are-we-ready-180031821.html">ChatGPT</a>, the more advanced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/openai-just-released-gpt-4-a-multi-modal-generative-ai-172326765.html">GPT-4</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-bard-ai-hands-on-a-work-in-progress-with-plenty-of-caveats-170956025.html">Google Bard</a>), <a href="https://www.engadget.com/open-a-is-dall-e-2-produces-fantastical-images-of-most-anything-you-can-imagine-170056814.html">image generators</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ai-voice-tool-deepfake-celebrity-audio-clips-094648743.html">voice cloners</a> have taken the world by storm in recent months. (Republicans are already using <a href="https://www.engadget.com/republicans-attack-biden-with-a-fully-ai-generated-ad-184055192.html">AI-generated images in political attack ads</a>.) Various experts have voiced concerns that, if left unregulated, humanity could face grave consequences. ‚ÄúLawmakers are often too slow to adapt to the rapidly changing technological environment,‚Äù Cason Schmit, Assistant Professor of Public Health at Texas A&amp;M University, <a href="https://theconversation.com/regulating-ai-3-experts-explain-why-its-difficult-to-do-and-important-to-get-right-198868">told</a><em>The Conversation</em> earlier this month. Although the federal government hasn‚Äôt passed any AI-based legislation since the proliferation of AI chatbots, a group of tech leaders and AI experts <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tech-leaders-and-ai-experts-demand-a-six-month-pause-on-out-of-control-ai-experiments-114553864.html">signed a letter</a> in March requesting an ‚Äúimmediate‚Äù six-month pause on developing AI systems beyond GPT-4. Additionally, the Biden administration recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-administration-wants-your-input-on-rules-for-ai-models-like-chatgpt-193527890.html">opened comments</a> seeking public feedback about possible AI regulations.</p><p>‚ÄúWhile we all try to grapple with the pace at which AI is accelerating, the future of AI and its role in society remains unclear,‚Äù said Rep. Lieu. ‚ÄúIt is our job as Members of Congress to have responsible foresight when it comes to protecting future generations from potentially devastating consequences. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm pleased to introduce the bipartisan, bicameral Block Nuclear Launch by Autonomous AI Act, which will ensure that no matter what happens in the future, a human being has control over the employment of a nuclear weapon ‚Äì not a robot. AI can never be a substitute for human judgment when it comes to launching nuclear weapons.‚Äù</p><p>Given the current political climate in Washington, passing even the most common-sense of bills isn‚Äôt guaranteed. Nevertheless, perhaps a proposal as fundamental as ‚Äúdon‚Äôt let computers decide to obliterate humanity‚Äù will serve as a litmus test for how prepared the US government is to deal with this quickly evolving technology.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/us-lawmakers-introduce-bill-to-prevent-ai-controlled-nuclear-launches-184727260.html?src=rss

## Peacock drops first trailer for high-octane ‚ÄòTwisted Metal‚Äô adaptation

<p>After decades of middling results, video game adaptations are finally the hottest thing in entertainment, especially after those <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-super-mario-bros-movie-sets-box-office-records-as-the-highest-grossing-video-game-movie-100838234.html"><em><ins>Super Mario Bros. Movie</ins></em><ins> box office numbers</ins></a>. Streamer Peacock is joining the video game adaptation wars with a live action comedy based on the PS1-era vehicular warfare simulator <em>Twisted Metal</em> and it just dropped the first trailer.</p><p>For the uninitiated (anyone under 30), <em>Twisted Metal</em> was a hugely popular franchise that is sort of a riff on the Battle Mode from the Mario Kart series, with a heavy emphasis on comical violence and absolute destruction. Think <em>Rocket League</em> with guns. The show seems to be scrapping the arena-based nature of the games with a journey across a post-apocalyptic wasteland.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p></p><div id="553aa404854942748c2384b64ed072c3"></div><p>The series stars the newly-appointed Captain America, Anthony Mackie and <em>Brooklyn 99 </em>standout Stephanie Beatriz. You can‚Äôt tell much from the apocalypse-soaked trailer, but the show‚Äôs description describes Mackie as a ‚Äúmotor-mouthed outsider offered a chance at a better life‚Äù and Beatriz as a ‚Äúbadass axe-wielding car thief.‚Äù It also wouldn‚Äôt be <em>Twisted Metal</em> without the iconic killer clown Sweet Tooth, described here as a ‚Äúderanged clown who drives an all too familiar ice cream truck.‚Äù</p><p>The franchise arguably reached its pinnacle in 1996 with <em>Twisted Metal 2</em>, and there hasn‚Äôt been a new release in over a decade, so who exactly is this show for? Who knows! But it has evil clowns and explosive car chases, so who cares? The first season premieres July 27th and consists of ten episodes.</p><p>This is just another step in Sony‚Äôs plans to bring its big gaming franchises into other media, which has so far included the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uncharted-movie-review-tom-holland-mark-wahlberg-190043901.html"><ins>plodding </ins><em><ins>Uncharted</ins></em><ins> movie</ins></a> and the mega-popular <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-last-of-us-season-one-hbo-review-080135969.html"><em><ins>The Last of Us</ins></em><ins> series</ins></a> on HBO. Prepare for an onslaught of PlayStation adaptations in the near future, including <em>Horizon Zero Dawn, Gran Turismo</em> and <em>God of War.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/peacock-drops-first-trailer-for-high-octane-twisted-metal-adaptation-181201055.html?src=rss

A $10-per-month Premium subscription is also required (after the six-month trial) for guided programs, personalized fitness feedback and sleep insights.

## ‚ÄòVampire Survivors‚Äô is getting an animated television series

<p><em>Vampire Survivors</em>, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vampire-survivors-xbox-game-pass-return-to-monkey-island-football-manager-pentiment-somerville-143045534-143045394.html">addictively casual indie game</a>, is getting an animated television series. Known for its rich and cinematic backstory to the same degree as narrative-driven classics <em>Space Invaders</em>, <em>BurgerTime</em> and <em>Dig Dug</em>, <em>Vampire Survivors</em> is a pick-up-and-play casual game with simple 2D character sprites. Media company Story Kitchen will partner with the game‚Äôs creator, Luca Galante (founder of developer poncle), to make the series.</p><p>Galante said in a (hopefully) cheeky tone, ‚ÄúThe most important thing in <em>Vampire Survivors</em> is the story, so it‚Äôs a dream come true to see what started as a little indie game I made on my weekends come to life as an animated TV show! It‚Äôs also great to be partnering up with such experienced and talented people to make the show. I do wonder if they‚Äôve realized that there isn‚Äôt a single vampire in <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, though.‚Äù If the announcement sets the stage for the series, we may be in store for a show brimming with self-aware and tongue-in-cheek humor.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The game‚Äôs <a href="https://poncle.itch.io/vampire-survivors">backstory</a> is no more complex than the blurb, ‚ÄúThe year 2021, Rural Italy, there lived an evil person named Bisconte Dracul√≥, whose many evil magics created a bad world filled with famine and suffering. It‚Äôs now up to the members of the Belpaese family to end his reign of terror and return good food to the table.‚Äù <em>Vampire Survivor</em>‚Äôs gameplay revolves around controlling an auto-firing character‚Äôs movement and loadout as they blast away increasingly daunting hordes of enemies. It borrows elements from roguelike games and tower defense (with Castlevania-esque characters). Once you settle into the action, it can almost become a meditative experience.

## Walmart's suppliers would rather negotiate with AI than a human

<p>Never mind using AI to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chatgpt-is-suddenly-everywhere-are-we-ready-180031821.html">write stories</a> ‚Äî Walmart is finding it helpful for landing a good bargain. The retailer <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-26/walmart-uses-pactum-ai-tools-to-handle-vendor-negotiations?sref=10lNAhZ9">tells</a><em>Bloomberg</em> that it's using a chatbot from Pactum AI to automatically negotiate some supplier deals. The technology is not only <a href="https://hbr.org/2022/11/how-walmart-automated-supplier-negotiations">saving</a> an average of three percent on contracts, but preferable to the vendors. Three out of four suppliers prefer haggling with the AI over a human, Walmart says.</p><p>Pactum's system just asks Walmart to set its budget and requirements, such as discounts and payment terms. It compares a supplier's demands with trends, commodity values and competitors' costs. After that, the AI can strike a deal within a matter of days, rather than the weeks or months of conventional talks. Walmart first piloted the tool in Canada, but has since expanded its use to the US, Chile and South Africa.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The AI is currently negotiating only for shopping carts and other store essentials, rather than the products you find on the shelves. It's also not completely replacing humans. At present, Pactum's tech is mainly being used for savings in contracts that aren't necessarily worth much time. The bot still has to negotiate with a real person, so completely automated discussions aren't any option in the near future. This is more to lighten the load of busy procurement teams than to avoid hiring.</p><p>That might not reassure people worried about their jobs. The reliance on AI comes right as many companies are conducting <a href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech-layoffs-183005386.html">mass layoffs</a> to endure a rough economy. Chatbots like this can help Walmart and others minimize the effects of job cuts and hiring freezes. Moreover, Walmart has spent years <a href="https://www.engadget.com/walmart-automated-fulfillment-centers-132500980.html">experimenting with robots</a> that could reduce the need for staff. Humans aren't going away any time soon, but the company isn't depending on them as much as in the past.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/walmarts-suppliers-would-rather-negotiate-with-ai-than-a-human-162131831.html?src=rss

## Sony WH-CH720N review: Budget-friendly headphones with premium sound

<p>Sony has a great track record when it comes to budget headphones. The company‚Äôs <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-04-01-sony-wh-ch710n-headphones-announced-price-specs-availability.html"><ins>WH-CH710N</ins></a> were excellent, but overpriced initially. Sony made them an incredible value at $150 after it cut the price shortly after their debut in 2020. Great sound quality, capable ANC, good battery life and a comfy fit made the WH-CH710N a compelling, affordable alternative to the premium <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-18-sony-1000xm3-review.html"><ins>WH-1000XM3</ins></a>, which was the company‚Äôs flagship model at the time. Earlier this year, the company debuted <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonys-new-midrange-headphones-borrow-the-premium-wh-1000xm5s-v1-chip-173338347.html"><ins>the follow-up</ins></a> to that three-year-old set: the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Tb255LVdILUNINzIwTi1DYW5jZWxpbmctSGVhZHBob25lcy1NaWNyb3Bob25lL2RwL0IwQlMxUUNGSFgvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXYwLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1MmYzNWY5OC1jN2FjLTQ4MTctYTVmYS03NWQzYzNhZjliN2QifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUP0ioUlPwdnkQyTavC6vmJpmXsPPls5tUiwAIrGUODa&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSony-WH-CH720N-Canceling-Headphones-Microphone%2Fdp%2FB0BS1QCFHX%2F"><ins>WH-CH720N</ins></a>.</p><p>On paper, the 2023 edition should keep Sony‚Äôs reputation for solid mid-range and budget headphones as alternatives to the pricey <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wh-1000xm5-review-160045478.html"><ins>WH-1000XM5</ins></a>. The WH-CH720N houses the same V1 chip from the M5, which powers both active noise cancellation (ANC) and overall sound quality. There‚Äôs also an updated design and a lower price following another early cut ($130), but battery life remains the same at 35 hours. So, is the WH-CH720N another mid-range hit for Sony?</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p></p><p>Let‚Äôs start with the design. The WH-CH720N takes cues from Sony‚Äôs more recent 1000X headphones and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wh-xb910n-anc-headphones-best-price-134525061.html"><ins>WH-XB910N</ins></a>, primarily the headband and ear cup hinges. The outside of the ear cups are flatter and they‚Äôre just hard plastic ‚Äì no soft-touch material here. Like previous mid-range Sony models, the WH-CH720N has physical controls with a power/pairing button on the left beside the USB-C charging port and 3.5mm jack. On the right side, there‚Äôs a dedicated noise canceling button that cycles between ANC and transparency mode. There‚Äôs also the typical three-button array with volume controls flanking the multi-function track and call button. That center control also summons your preferred voice assistant. While the buttons work reliably, the raised dash on the middle button is low, so it‚Äôs difficult to place your thumb quickly.</p><p>Like the WH-CH710N, this new model is supremely lightweight and comfy. I can easily wear these for hours at a time. There‚Äôs also ample cushioning in the ear pads and the headband hinge isn‚Äôt wound so tight it pinches my head. I liked a lot of what the 710N had to offer, but overall comfort was near the top of the list, so it‚Äôs great to see that Sony didn‚Äôt overlook this aspect when designing the follow-up version. The only real issue is that it uses <em>a lot</em> of plastic. While this helps keep the weight down, it also ensures the 720N look decidedly cheap.</p><p>The suite of features for the WH-CH720N inside the Sony Headphones app is where you‚Äôll notice key differences from the WH-1000XM5. Most notably, the 720N doesn‚Äôt have Speak-to-Chat, a feature that automatically pauses audio when it detects you‚Äôre talking. Related, this new model also doesn‚Äôt have automatic pausing when you take them off your head.</p><figure><img alt="Sony has been king of the headphone heap for a while with its 1000X line, but the company is staking its claim on the mid-range too. With the WH-CH720N, the company continues its track record of great sound quality and a comfy fit in a set of more affordable headphones. You‚Äôll have to forgo some premium features, but there‚Äôs still plenty to like here. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/1ee40cc1-e55b-11ed-b5ff-f790b59d3fb2" style="height: 1333px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Despite a few omissions, there are still some handy tools available. First, Adaptive Sound Control allows the app to automatically adjust settings based on your location or activity. This allows you to turn on ANC when you arrive at the office or activate transparency mode when you start a run, for example. Here, and in the general sound settings, you can specify a level of ambient sound and choose to pipe in voices while this mode is active.</p><p>Additionally, Sony offers an EQ slider for manual adjustments as well as a separate bass adjustment. There‚Äôs also a collection of audio presets if you‚Äôre in a hurry. 360 Reality Audio is available on the WH-CH720N (with a compatible streaming subscription) and the app gives you the option of DSEE upscaling to improve compressed content. The app also allows you to activate multipoint Bluetooth for two devices and a Safe Listening feature is there to help preserve your hearing.</p><p>Perhaps the most surprising thing about the WH-CH710N was the overall sound quality. I was amazed at what Sony managed in a set of headphones that cost half as much as its flagship model. There was ample bass with an open soundstage and great clarity in the details. Thankfully, the WH-CH720N is more of the same. These headphones allow the subtleties of boygenius‚Äô <em>the record </em>to shine, from the somber guitar effects to the quieter keyboard/organ parts of songs like ‚ÄúTrue Blue.‚Äù There are lots of more subdued parts on the record that you can easily pick up on. The fingerpicked acoustic guitar and banjo on ‚ÄúCool About It‚Äù are also quite dynamic and textural.</p><p>Heavier, more chaotic genres fare just as well. Better Lovers‚Äô gritty, thrashy metal track ‚Äú30 Under 13‚Äù is quite a ride. Even the fastest, grindiest riffs are captured with surprising clarity. All the instruments stand on their own, and at no point do they become a smashed together mess. The dynamics of tracks like O‚ÄôBrother‚Äôs ‚ÄúHalogen Eye'' also come through well. There‚Äôs plenty of grainy, thick distortion on the verses and these headphones get every bit of that texture, in addition to reverb and other effects that create the band‚Äôs atmospheric, moody soundscape.</p><p>Lastly, on Nickel Creek‚Äôs <em>Celebrants </em>‚Äì a modern bluegrass record ‚Äì the WH-CH720N allows you to feel like you‚Äôre in the room with the band. Helped in part by the positioning of the guitar, mandolin, fiddle and bass in the mix, the headphones keep the sensation of sitting in on a private performance rather than simply listening to a recorded track.</p><figure><img alt="Sony has been king of the headphone heap for a while with its 1000X line, but the company is staking its claim on the mid-range too. With the WH-CH720N, the company continues its track record of great sound quality and a comfy fit in a set of more affordable headphones.

The ANC will do just fine for you in most cases, especially with constant noise. However, these headphones really struggle with human voices, which doesn‚Äôt make them the best option if your primary aim is to block out a nearby phone call or chatty colleagues. Transparency mode offers a great natural sound that comes in especially handy when you‚Äôre taking video and voice calls. Speaking of calls, the 720N does a decent job blocking background noise and the overall audio quality makes you sound better than speakerphone and most earbuds. It‚Äôs not pristine, but it‚Äôs a cut above the status quo.</p><p>When it comes to battery life, Sony promises up to 35 hours with ANC on. During what I consider normal use ‚Äì a mix of noise canceling and transparency mode for music and calls, plus powering off a few times overnight ‚Äì the app showed 40 percent remaining after 28 hours. The Bluetooth menu in macOS backed this up. The company says you can expect up to 50 hours with ANC off, so my mixed-use trials were on par with that. Battery life estimates have never been a problem on Sony headphones and that‚Äôs not the case here either. Plus, 35 hours is on par with most flagship models these days, even if it‚Äôs the same figure as the previous model.</p><p>The <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Tb255LVdILUNINzIwTi1DYW5jZWxpbmctSGVhZHBob25lcy1NaWNyb3Bob25lL2RwL0IwQlMxUUNGSFgvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXYwLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1MmYzNWY5OC1jN2FjLTQ4MTctYTVmYS03NWQzYzNhZjliN2QifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUP0ioUlPwdnkQyTavC6vmJpmXsPPls5tUiwAIrGUODa&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSony-WH-CH720N-Canceling-Headphones-Microphone%2Fdp%2FB0BS1QCFHX%2F"><ins>WH-CH720N</ins></a> is a strong contender to replace the current budget pick in our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-headphones-150030794.html"><ins>best headphones</ins></a> guide, but if you need a solid alternative look to Audio-Technica.

## Razer Blade 16 review: A miraculous display in a laptop you can probably skip

<p>The Razer Blade 16 is one of the most unique laptops we‚Äôve ever seen ‚Äì I just wish I could recommend it as easily as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-blade-15-2022-review-a-real-treat-if-youve-got-the-cash-160032467.html">the Blade 15</a>. It can handle 4K gaming just as well as high-speed 1080p gameplay, thanks to a dual-mode screen. And it‚Äôs one of the fastest notebooks around, featuring Intel‚Äôs latest CPUs and NVIDIA‚Äôs newest GPUs. And notably, it can be configured with an RTX 4090.</p><p>But all of that comes at a cost. It‚Äôs noticeably heavier than the Blade 15, and you‚Äôll have to pay at least $3,300 to own one with the dual-mode display. It‚Äôs like Razer put another Razer tax on top of its already high prices.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p></p><div id="1fcb4f73772545538aeb85e6c2eb5506"></div><p>For some, though, the cost will be worth it. The Blade 16‚Äôs MiniLED display can natively handle 4K+ 120Hz (meaning it can show up to 120fps gameplay), and 1080p+ 240Hz. You could always configure a 4K panel to scale down to 1080p or lower resolutions, but that usually leads to a muddy mess, and 4K screens are typically limited to 120Hz at best. What‚Äôs special about the Blade 16 is that it delivers those resolutions as sharply as standalone monitors.</p><p>According to Razer, the Blade 16‚Äôs dual-mode MiniLED technology was developed together with the display maker AUO. The screen is natively a 4K+ 240Hz panel that can sync pixels together to accurately scale down to 1080p, something that looks far better than typical downscaling. Razer says there‚Äôs no mobile GPU or data pipeline that can effectively deliver 4K at 240Hz, so that refresh rate is only possible in 1080p. (It‚Äôs still <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-ces-monitors-8k-57-inch-ultra-wide-odyssey-150046205.html">rare to find 4K 240Hz on desktop monitors</a>, and even a 4090 would have trouble hitting 240fps at that resolution.)</p><p>Previously, you'd have to choose between a 4K screen with a much lower refresh rate, or a faster 1080p or 1,440p display. The Blade 16 lets you have your gaming cake and eat it too. The only downside is that switching between those two modes requires a complete reboot. Given how miraculous technology seems, though, I don't think that's a huge problem. If you care more about resolution, stick with the 4K 120Hz mode until you need to dive into some fast-paced competitive gaming.</p><p>Maybe instead of thinking of the Blade 16 as a slight upgrade from the 15-inch model, it's better to think of it as a shrunken down Blade 17. That's another massive and expensive computer, but potential buyers are likely aware of its downsides. More importantly, the Blade 17 was the fastest Razer laptop for years ‚Äî now that title belongs to the Blade 16 and the new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-blade-18-review-specs-price-overpowered-and-oversized-133044127.html">Blade 18</a>.</p><figure><img alt="Razer Blade 16 dual mode monitor option" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/db3fb2f0-e468-11ed-b7fd-6ec031fb2875" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Both of these laptops feature Intel's 13th-gen mobile CPUs, as well as NVIDIA's more powerful RTX 4080 and 4090 GPUs. This is the first time we've seen NVIDIA's 90-series hardware on any notebook, so that alone is sure to be a hook for power hungry gamers. Strangely, though, Razer's dual-mode display is only available on the Blade 16 ‚Äî the tech likely isn't there yet to make it happen on the bigger computer.</p><p>In practice, the Blade 16 excelled at both 4K and 1080p gaming. <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>and <em>Halo Infinite</em> looked absolutely crisp in 4K with their graphics and ray tracing settings maxed out. Both games also looked far brighter than I've ever seen on a laptop thanks to the MiniLED panel. That's particularly useful for bright HDR highlights, something most notebooks and monitors handle poorly.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p>None</p></td><td><p>PCMark 10</p></td><td><p>3DMark (TimeSpy Extreme)</p></td><td><p>Geekbench 5</p></td><td><p>Cinebench R23</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Razer Blade 16 (Intel i9-13950HX, NVIDIA RTX 4090)</p></td><td><p>7,364</p></td><td><p>8,667</p></td><td><p>1,943/18,227</p></td><td><p>2,024/15,620</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Razer Blade 18 (Intel i9-13950HX, NVIDIA RTX 4060)</p></td><td><p>7,326</p></td><td><p>5,009</p></td><td><p>1,980/13,658</p></td><td><p>1,900/15,442</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Razer Blade 15 (2022, Intel i7-12800H, NVIDIA RTX 3080 Ti)</p></td><td><p>7,085</p></td><td><p>4,798</p></td><td><p>1,795/9,529</p></td><td><p>1,661/10,464</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>ASUS Zephyrus G14 (2022, AMD Ryzen 9 6900HS, Radeon RX 6800S)</p></td><td><p>7,170</p></td><td><p>3,821</p></td><td><p>1,543/9,839</p></td><td><p>1,521/12,212</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Given the sheer power of the RTX 4090 in our review unit, the Blade 16 was also able to play games in 4K well beyond 60fps. Depending on your graphics settings, you may even be able to reach 120fps to fully max out its screen. <em>Halo Infinite</em> hit a very playable 80fps with ultra graphics settings, while <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>hit 70fps with Ultra ray tracing settings thanks to DLSS 3.</p><p>Not surprisingly, the Blade 16 had no issue getting above 200fps in <em>Halo Infinite </em>and <em>Overwatch 2</em> when I flipped over to 1080p mode. Personally, I've never really seen the point of gaming screens beyond 120Hz ‚Äî I just can‚Äôt really perceive much of a difference by bumping up to 144 or 240Hz. But after switching between the Blade 16's various modes, I noticed that I played better as I approached 200fps ‚Äî I hit headshots more regularly, and I was faster to react whenever enemies popped up. Maybe it was just luck, or me feeling more comfortable over time ‚Äî or maybe those extra frames actually helped.</p><p>As much as I enjoyed the Blade 16's gorgeous display and incredible performance, I didn't love lugging it around my house or hauling it in a bookbag. It weighs 5.4 pounds, a full pound heavier than the Blade 15. Now that might not seem like much, but it makes a huge difference for portability. Living with the Blade 15 was no different than most other 15-inch notebooks, but the Blade 16 feels noticeably bulkier.</p><section><img alt="Razer Blade 16 overhead view of the keyboard" class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/db3f8be0-e468-11ed-ba7d-ee9bc734532c" /></section><p>But again, maybe I should be judging it against the Blade 17 instead, which weighed a little over 6 pounds. When compared to that, the Blade 16 seems like a remarkable engineering feat. That's not the way most people think of 16-inch notebooks though: The MacBook Pro 16 replaced the 15-inch model, and many other laptop makers are following suit with their larger notebooks.</p><p>On the non-gaming front, the Blade 16 also excelled at everything I threw at it. Scrolling through websites and documents was a dream, thanks to that high refresh rate screen. And while it doesn‚Äôt include a mechanical keyboard like Alienware and other competitors, the Blade 16‚Äôs typing experience was solid. The trackpad is also far larger than the Blade 15‚Äôs, but it‚Äôs just as smooth and responsive. And you can actually expect to do a decent amount of work before recharging: In PCMark 10‚Äôs battery benchmark, it lasted 5 hours and 15 minutes, two hours more than the Blade 18. It also has every port you‚Äôd want: three USB 3.0 Type A connections (two on the left side, one on the right), HDMI, two USB-C ports (one of which supports Thunderbolt 4) and a microSD card slot.</p><figure><img alt="Razer Blade 16 USB ports and SD card slot" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/db3f64d0-e468-11ed-9fdf-f362ce53c1c5" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>As I spent time with the Blade 16, I couldn‚Äôt help but ask myself: Is it <em>really </em>worth spending more for a dual-mode screen, when fast 1,440p laptops are becoming increasingly affordable? Personally, I think that resolution sits at a sweet spot between delivering more pixels than 1080p, but also achieving faster refresh rates than any 4K panel. For most people, a 1,440p laptop (like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-zephyrus-g14-review-amd-ryzen-radeon-173016459.html">Zephyrus G14</a>) simply makes more sense ‚Äì especially when you can find them for $1,000 (or more) less than the Blade 16.</p><p>Given its added heft, as well as its higher $2,700 starting price (with an RTX 4060), I can't recommend the Blade 16 to most buyers ‚Äì not when the Blade 15 is still around and starts at $2,000 with a 3070 Ti. If you want the 4060, be prepared to shell out another $500. And if you‚Äôre mainly intrigued by the dual-mode display on the Blade 16, that costs $3,300 with an RTX 4070. Honestly, that‚Äôs a ridiculously high price for a laptop with that GPU. Our review unit cost a whopping $4,300 with the Core i9-13950HX, RTX 4090, 32GB of RAM and a 2TB SSD.</p><p>But, just like much of Apple‚Äôs hardware, the Razer tax may be something we have to pay for innovation. The Blade 16‚Äôs dual-mode screen is one of the most remarkable things I‚Äôve seen in a gaming laptop lately ‚Äì but for most shoppers, the Blade 15 will be far more practical.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/razer-blade-16-review-4k-1080p-miniled-screen-151100229.html?src=rss

## OnePlus Pad review: Solid hardware that's let down by Android

<p>I really thought we were done with Android tablets. Google itself hasn‚Äôt released one in years, though that‚Äôll change soon with the forthcoming Pixel Tablet. Samsung has hit on a high-end formula that works pretty well, Amazon‚Äôs cheap Fire tablets <em>technically</em> run Android‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs basically it. Plenty of manufacturers have tried, but for various reasons Android tablets have never caught on.</p><p>Despite that market reality, OnePlus is taking its first shot at this market with the $479 OnePlus Pad. As the price hints, OnePlus isn‚Äôt going right after high-end tablets like Samsung‚Äôs Galaxy S8 lineup or Apple‚Äôs iPad Air or Pro. Instead, this tablet reminds me more of Apple‚Äôs 10th-generation iPad, in style, substance and price. And the fact that OnePlus is also making a keyboard folio and a stylus shows they‚Äôre serious about making a tablet built for more than just watching movies or browsing the web. But while OnePlus made a lovely piece of hardware, Android‚Äôs large-screen limitations continue to hamper the overall experience.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p></p><h2>Hardware</h2><p>The OnePlus Pad makes a great first impression. That starts with its striking metallic green color and subtle rounded brushing of the metal that surrounds the centered camera bump on the tablet‚Äôs back. I‚Äôm a little surprised that OnePlus isn‚Äôt offering the Pad in a more generic color like black or silver, but the green makes it stand out a bit without being something most people will object to.</p><p>Despite having a relatively large, 11.6-inch display, it‚Äôs light and easy to hold with one hand. That‚Äôs due in part to the tiny 6.7mm bezel surrounding the display. That‚Äôs slightly thinner than the one on my 11-inch iPad Pro and noticeably thinner than the one on the current Air or 10th-generation iPad. OnePlus used a rather unusual screen ratio here, 7:5, but I definitely prefer that over the 16:9 ratio so common on other devices. Movies and shows will have more noticeable black bars, but everything else benefits from more vertical screen real estate.</p><figure><img alt="Photos of the OnePlus Pad tablet and its keyboard folio and Stylo pen accessories." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/074b48a1-e51d-11ed-abfe-6e0b373abc9f" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>Besides the screen, there‚Äôs nothing else of note on the front of the Pad aside from the landscape-oriented 8-megapixel camera for video chat. On the sides, you‚Äôll notice the power button and two volume buttons, a USB-C port and four speakers. As with most successful tablet designs, it‚Äôs a screen-first device that is light and easy to hold, which is probably the most important thing.</p><p>There‚Äôs a lot to like about the OnePlus Tab‚Äôs screen besides just the size. OnePlus says it‚Äôs a Dolby Vision panel with HDR, and its 2,800 x 2,000 resolution works out to 296 pixels per inch. Even though it‚Äôs an LCD, lacking the extreme contrast ratios you‚Äôll find on OLED or mini-LED panels, it‚Äôs still an extremely bright and vibrant display, whether you‚Äôre looking through photos, watching a movie or playing games. It also has a 144Hz refresh rate, though most apps max out at 120Hz. Still, that‚Äôs better than any iPad in this price range.</p><p>The four-speaker system is also much better than I expected, given the Tab‚Äôs svelte profile. It can get surprisingly loud, pumping out enough volume for watching movies on your own or with a friend. But more importantly than just the level, the sound is clear and balanced. You‚Äôll still likely want to opt for headphones during any more serious listening session, but these speakers definitely do the job in a pinch.</p><p>On the inside is MediaTek‚Äôs Dimensity 9000, a Cortex-X2 processor which runs at 3.05 GHz; that‚Äôs paired with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.</p><p></p><h2>Accessories</h2><p>Unsurprisingly, OnePlus made a keyboard folio and stylus to go along with the Tab.Also unsurprisingly, the tablet isn‚Äôt bundled with either, so you‚Äôll need to shell out extra cash to complete your rig. The $149 keyboard includes a trackpad and connects directly to the Pad via pogo pins, so it doesn‚Äôt need its own power or a Bluetooth connection. It‚Äôs thin and attaches easily to the Pad without adding any significant weight or bulk, which is a nice change of pace from the comfortable but heavy Magic Keyboard that goes along with my iPad Pro.</p><p>The keyboard is a bit of a mixed bag, though. On the plus side, it‚Äôs just big enough to be comfortable to type on for extended periods of time. Like the keyboard on the similarly-sized iPad Air or Pro, there‚Äôs a little learning curve, but the keys are a good size and have decent travel. The space key was a lot less reliable than I hoped, though (apologies to my editor who had to fix the numerous missing spaces in this draft). The trackpad, on the other hand, was a bit more problematic. It wasn‚Äôt great at rejecting input from the edge of my hands, so it often moved the cursor randomly around as I was typing this review. It was incredibly frustrating and almost made me give up on it entirely. I eventually managed to hold my hands to minimize the mistaken input, but it still happened often enough to be maddening.</p><figure><img alt="Photos of the OnePlus Pad tablet and its keyboard folio and Stylo pen accessories." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/075581d0-e51d-11ed-bbff-bec30e780d69" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>The trackpad itself was generally fine for moving through the OnePlus Pad‚Äôs interface, but it felt just a little slow to respond to everything I was doing, whether scrolling, swiping or clicking on things. This is a recurring theme with the whole OnePlus Pad experience, unfortunately. The trackpad itself is small, but I‚Äôm plenty comfortable with a similar-sized one on my iPad.</p><p>The last nit I‚Äôll pick about the keyboard folio is that you can‚Äôt adjust the angle of the screen at all. The folio holds it in a fixed position, so hopefully that works for you. This isn‚Äôt dissimilar to some other keyboard folios for other tablets in this price range, so I will only complain so much, but it would still be nice if it was adjustable.</p><p>There‚Äôs also a stylus available for the Pad, the $99 OnePlus Stylo. Like the second-generation Apple Pencil, the Stylo magnetically attaches to the top of the Pad for power and convenient storage. I love this trick on the iPad, and I love it here as well. The Stylo itself is a round (aside from the flat charging edge), fairly nondescript piece of hardware that serves its purpose well.</p><p>I have zero visual arts skills, so I can‚Äôt say exactly how it compares to using an iPad and Apple Pencil for serious creative work. But, OnePlus says it has 4,096 levels of pressure and 60 degrees of tilt, which should make it a versatile instrument. And in a little testing taking notes and scribbling around in the OnePlus Notes app, I was immediately impressed at the total lack of lag. If you can find the right drawing software, the OnePlus Pad and the Stylo could make a reasonably affordable and powerful drawing kit.</p><figure><img alt="Photos of the OnePlus Pad tablet and its keyboard folio and Stylo pen accessories." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/074b48a0-e51d-11ed-8bf7-c5c2d00946f7" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><h2>Software experience</h2><p>As with basically every Android tablet I‚Äôve ever used, the thing that is holding the OnePlus Pad back isn‚Äôt its hardware, but the software. The Pad runs Android 13.1 with OnePlus‚Äô Oxygen OS on top of it. For the most part, Oxygen OS represents a minor re-skinning of the Android UI, along with a couple custom OnePlus apps as well as some handy tricks if you also use a OnePlus phone. Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt have access to a OnePlus phone for this review, but these features are worth noting.</p><p>For starters, OnePlus has a cellular data sharing feature that lets the Pad jump onto the 5G signal from a OnePlus smartphone. It‚Äôs automatically enabled when the phone is near the Pad. Obviously, tethering another device to a smartphone signal isn‚Äôt new technology, but OnePlus is definitely trying to make it more seamless. Furthermore, OnePlus built in an ‚ÄúAuto Connect‚Äù feature between the Pad and a compatible phone, which means you can receive notifications, share clipboard data for instant copy and pasting, and see text messages and phone calls on the Pad. If you‚Äôre in the OnePlus ecosystem already, this is a solid reason to consider the Pad over another competing tablet.</p><p>OnePlus also did a decent job of including some apps that take advantage of the Pad‚Äôs screen ‚Äì the Notes app uses multiple panes to show your list of notes as well as whatever you‚Äôre working on, or you can go into a full-screen focus mode. It also has a to-do app built in and works well with the Stylo if you want to draw or take handwritten notes. The Weather app, meanwhile, feels like a clone of what you might find on the iPad, but it‚Äôs still useful and takes advantage of a bigger screen, rather than feeling like a blown-up phone app.</p><figure><img alt="Photos of the OnePlus Pad tablet and its keyboard folio and Stylo pen accessories." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/07564520-e51d-11ed-bfbf-74aff1268082" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>Naturally, Google has done a great job of making its apps work on a larger screen, as well. Chrome, Gmail, Photos, Drive, Docs, Meet and basically anything else I tried from Google felt native, which goes a long way towards making the OnePlus Pad feel useful.</p><p>The experience isn‚Äôt so great once you start using third-party apps, though. If you‚Äôve ever read a review of an Android tablet, you‚Äôve heard this complaint before. There just aren‚Äôt enough Android apps designed to take advantage of a bigger screen. Comparing things like Slack and Twitter to their iPad counterparts shows that the developers haven‚Äôt taken larger-screen Android devices into account. On the iPad, both apps have multiple panes which makes it much easier to get things done. On the Pad, Slack just shows any conversation you‚Äôre in at full width. Similarly, tweets stretch across the entire screen and images or video aren‚Äôt scaled down at all. Todoist, another app I use constantly, has a sidebar, but it automatically hides whenever I tap on an item, so I have to keep resummoning it.</p><p>There are also numerous apps, like Reddit and Instagram, that simply don‚Äôt run in landscape orientation at all. Even worse, some apps throw you from landscape into portrait mode. For example, HBO Max seems to work fine in landscape mode, but when I exit a movie, the screen jumps to portrait mode. There are also plenty of strange bugs throughout the system. More than once, I tried playing a video in HBO Max or the Google TV app only to have it refuse to load. This happened in both apps back-to-back and was only cleared up after rebooting the tablet. Another fun one is the notification I get <em>every single time</em> I open up the keyboard folio that tells me to ‚Äúconfigure physical keyboard,‚Äù which brings up a menu with basically nothing you can actually configure.</p><p>Probably the most frustrating thing for me was simply trying to work across multiple apps. Pressing alt-tab brings up a view of recently-used apps, but the implementation is poor. If you tap alt-tab once and don‚Äôt hold anything, all it does is zoom out of the app you‚Äôre in and then drop you back. On basically every other computer I can think of, this key command brings you straight to the last app you were using. If you keep holding alt and press tab again, you‚Äôll start cycling through your recent apps ‚Äì but there‚Äôs absolutely no visual indicator to show which you have selected, so it‚Äôs useless. Swiping up on the trackpad with three fingers and holding for a second also drops you into this view, and you can then swipe around with the trackpad and click on the app you want. That‚Äôs marginally better, but not having a reliable keyboard shortcut for moving between apps is infuriating.</p><p>Just as you can on an iPad, you can split an app view and run two apps side-by-side. This generally works fine ‚Äì but if you exit out to the home screen, the only way to get that dual view back is by going into the aforementioned app switching view. Tapping the app‚Äôs icon on the home screen will bring that app back up in full screen, forgetting the configuration you had before</p><p>Despite all this, the OnePlus Pad is fairly responsive, at least. Websites and apps loaded quickly, but scrolling through sites or my long list of emails felt a little bit choppy. That‚Äôs despite the screen‚Äôs high refresh rate. Similarly, games I tried (including <em>Genshin Impact</em>, <em>Asphalt 9 </em>and my go-to <em>Alto‚Äôs Odyssey</em>) mostly worked fine, but had occasional moments where it felt the hardware was struggling slightly. For a tablet priced under $500, the OnePlus Pad more or less met my expectations ‚Äì but it‚Äôs not as smooth as even the most basic iPad.</p><p>One area where the OnePlus Pad is definitively great is on battery life. I can get about 10 hours doing my normal work routine on the device, jumping between multiple apps, playing occasional games, watching some videos and streaming music. More extensive gaming sessions will always run the battery down quicker, as will jacking up the screen brightness, but I don‚Äôt think anyone who tries this tablet will need to worry about reaching for the charger too often.</p><figure><img alt="Photos of the OnePlus Pad tablet and its keyboard folio and Stylo pen accessories." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/07564521-e51d-11ed-9efe-f4224ae28d86" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>After using the OnePlus Pad for a few weeks, I‚Äôm left struggling with who this device is for.

## OnePlus Tab review: Solid hardware that's let down by Android

<p>I really thought we were done with Android tablets. Google itself hasn‚Äôt released one in years, though that‚Äôll change soon with the forthcoming Pixel Tablet. Samsung has hit on a high-end formula that works pretty well, Amazon‚Äôs cheap Fire tablets <em>technically</em> run Android‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs basically it. Plenty of manufacturers have tried, but for various reasons Android tablets have never caught on.</p><p>Despite that market reality, OnePlus is taking its first shot at this market with the $479 OnePlus Pad. As the price hints, OnePlus isn‚Äôt going right after high-end tablets like Samsung‚Äôs Galaxy S8 lineup or Apple‚Äôs iPad Air or Pro. Instead, this tablet reminds me more of Apple‚Äôs 10th-generation iPad, in style, substance and price. And the fact that OnePlus is also making a keyboard folio and a stylus shows they‚Äôre serious about making a tablet built for more than just watching movies or browsing the web. But while OnePlus made a lovely piece of hardware, Android‚Äôs large-screen limitations continue to hamper the overall experience.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Hardware</h2><p>The OnePlus Tab makes a great first impression. That starts with its striking metallic green color and subtle rounded brushing of the metal that surrounds the centered camera bump on the tablet‚Äôs back. I‚Äôm a little surprised that OnePlus isn‚Äôt offering the Tab in a more generic color like black or silver, but the green makes it stand out a bit without being something most people will object to.</p><p>Despite having a relatively large, 11.6-inch display, it‚Äôs light and easy to hold with one hand. That‚Äôs due in part to the tiny 6.7mm bezel surrounding the display. That‚Äôs slightly thinner than the one on my 11-inch iPad Pro and noticeably thinner than the one on the current Air or 10th-generation iPad. OnePlus used a rather unusual screen ratio here, 7:5, but I definitely prefer that over the 16:9 ratio so common on other devices. Movies and shows will have more noticeable black bars, but everything else benefits from more vertical screen real estate.</p><figure><img alt="Photos of the OnePlus Pad tablet and its keyboard folio and Stylo pen accessories." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/074b48a1-e51d-11ed-abfe-6e0b373abc9f" style="height: 1333px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>Besides the screen, there‚Äôs nothing else of note on the front of the Pad aside from the landscape-oriented 8-megapixel camera for video chat. On the sides, you‚Äôll notice the power button and two volume buttons, a USB-C port and four speakers. As with most successful tablet designs, it‚Äôs a screen-first device that is light and easy to hold, which is probably the most important thing.</p><p>There‚Äôs a lot to like about the OnePlus Tab‚Äôs screen besides just the size. OnePlus says it‚Äôs a Dolby Vision panel with HDR, and its 2,800 x 2,000 resolution works out to 296 pixels per inch. Even though it‚Äôs an LCD, lacking the extreme contrast ratios you‚Äôll find on OLED or mini-LED panels, it‚Äôs still an extremely bright and vibrant display, whether you‚Äôre looking through photos, watching a movie or playing games. It also has a 144Hz refresh rate, though most apps max out at 120Hz. Still, that‚Äôs better than any iPad in this price range.</p><p>The four-speaker system is also much better than I expected, given the Tab‚Äôs svelte profile. It can get surprisingly loud, pumping out enough volume for watching movies on your own or with a friend. But more importantly than just the level, the sound is clear and balanced. You‚Äôll still likely want to opt for headphones during any more serious listening session, but these speakers definitely do the job in a pinch.</p><p>On the inside is MediaTek‚Äôs Dimensity 9000, a Cortex-X2 processor which runs at 3.05 GHz; that‚Äôs paired with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.</p><p></p><h2>Accessories</h2><p>Unsurprisingly, OnePlus made a keyboard folio and stylus to go along with the Tab.Also unsurprisingly, the tablet isn‚Äôt bundled with either, so you‚Äôll need to shell out extra cash to complete your rig. The $149 keyboard includes a trackpad and connects directly to the Tab via pogo pins, so it doesn‚Äôt need its own power or a Bluetooth connection. It‚Äôs thin and attaches easily to the Tab without adding any significant weight or bulk, which is a nice change of pace from the comfortable but heavy Magic Keyboard that goes along with my iPad Pro.</p><p>The keyboard is a bit of a mixed bag, though. On the plus side, it‚Äôs just big enough to be comfortable to type on for extended periods of time. Like the keyboard on the similarly-sized iPad Air or Pro, there‚Äôs a little learning curve, but the keys are a good size and have decent travel. The space key was a lot less reliable than I hoped, though (apologies to my editor who had to fix the numerous missing spaces in this draft). The trackpad, on the other hand, was a bit more problematic. It wasn‚Äôt great at rejecting input from the edge of my hands, so it often moved the cursor randomly around as I was typing this review. It was incredibly frustrating and almost made me give up on it entirely. I eventually managed to hold my hands to minimize the mistaken input, but it still happened often enough to be maddening.</p><figure><img alt="Photos of the OnePlus Pad tablet and its keyboard folio and Stylo pen accessories." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/075581d0-e51d-11ed-bbff-bec30e780d69" style="height: 1333px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>The trackpad itself was generally fine for moving through the OnePlus Pad‚Äôs interface, but it felt just a little slow to respond to everything I was doing, whether scrolling, swiping or clicking on things. This is a recurring theme with the whole OnePlus Pad experience, unfortunately. The trackpad itself is small, but I‚Äôm plenty comfortable with a similar-sized one on my iPad.</p><p>The last nit I‚Äôll pick about the keyboard folio is that you can‚Äôt adjust the angle of the screen at all. The folio holds it in a fixed position, so hopefully that works for you. This isn‚Äôt dissimilar to some other keyboard folios for other tablets in this price range, so I will only complain so much, but it would still be nice if it was adjustable.</p><p>There‚Äôs also a stylus available for the Pad, the $99 OnePlus Stylo. Like the second-generation Apple Pencil, the Stylo magnetically attaches to the top of the Pad for power and convenient storage. I love this trick on the iPad, and I love it here as well. The Stylo itself is a round (aside from the flat charging edge), fairly nondescript piece of hardware that serves its purpose well.</p><p>I have zero visual arts skills, so I can‚Äôt say exactly how it compares to using an iPad and Apple Pencil for serious creative work. But, OnePlus says it has 4,096 levels of pressure and 60 degrees of tilt, which should make it a versatile instrument. And in a little testing taking notes and scribbling around in the OnePlus Notes app, I was immediately impressed at the total lack of lag. If you can find the right drawing software, the OnePlus Pad and the Stylo could make a reasonably affordable and powerful drawing kit.</p><figure><img alt="Photos of the OnePlus Pad tablet and its keyboard folio and Stylo pen accessories." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/074b48a0-e51d-11ed-8bf7-c5c2d00946f7" style="height: 1333px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><h2>Software experience</h2><p>As with basically every Android tablet I‚Äôve ever used, the thing that is holding the OnePlus Pad back isn‚Äôt its hardware, but the software. The Pad runs Android 13.1 with OnePlus‚Äô Oxygen OS on top of it. For the most part, Oxygen OS represents a minor re-skinning of the Android UI, along with a couple custom OnePlus apps as well as some handy tricks if you also use a OnePlus phone. Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt have access to a OnePlus phone for this review, but these features are worth noting.</p><p>For starters, OnePlus has a cellular data sharing feature that lets the Pad jump onto the 5G signal from a OnePlus smartphone. It‚Äôs automatically enabled when the phone is near the Pad. Obviously, tethering another device to a smartphone signal isn‚Äôt new technology, but OnePlus is definitely trying to make it more seamless. Furthermore, OnePlus built in an ‚ÄúAuto Connect‚Äù feature between the Pad and a compatible phone, which means you can receive notifications, share clipboard data for instant copy and pasting, and see text messages and phone calls on the Pad. If you‚Äôre in the OnePlus ecosystem already, this is a solid reason to consider the Pad over another competing tablet.</p><p>OnePlus also did a decent job of including some apps that take advantage of the Pad‚Äôs screen ‚Äì the Notes app uses multiple panes to show your list of notes as well as whatever you‚Äôre working on, or you can go into a full-screen focus mode. It also has a to-do app built in and works well with the Stylo if you want to draw or take handwritten notes. The Weather app, meanwhile, feels like a clone of what you might find on the iPad, but it‚Äôs still useful and takes advantage of a bigger screen, rather than feeling like a blown-up phone app.</p><figure><img alt="Photos of the OnePlus Pad tablet and its keyboard folio and Stylo pen accessories." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/07564520-e51d-11ed-bfbf-74aff1268082" style="height: 1333px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>Naturally, Google has done a great job of making its apps work on a larger screen, as well. Chrome, Gmail, Photos, Drive, Docs, Meet and basically anything else I tried from Google felt native, which goes a long way towards making the OnePlus Pad feel useful.</p><p>The experience isn‚Äôt so great once you start using third-party apps, though. If you‚Äôve ever read a review of an Android tablet, you‚Äôve heard this complaint before. There just aren‚Äôt enough Android apps designed to take advantage of a bigger screen. Comparing things like Slack and Twitter to their iPad counterparts shows that the developers haven‚Äôt taken larger-screen Android devices into account. On the iPad, both apps have multiple panes which makes it much easier to get things done. On the Pad, Slack just shows any conversation you‚Äôre in at full width. Similarly, tweets stretch across the entire screen and images or video aren‚Äôt scaled down at all. Todoist, another app I use constantly, has a sidebar, but it automatically hides whenever I tap on an item, so I have to keep resummoning it.</p><p>There are also numerous apps, like Reddit and Instagram, that simply don‚Äôt run in landscape orientation at all. Even worse, some apps throw you from landscape into portrait mode. For example, HBO Max seems to work fine in landscape mode, but when I exit a movie, the screen jumps to portrait mode. There are also plenty of strange bugs throughout the system. More than once, I tried playing a video in HBO Max or the Google TV app only to have it refuse to load. This happened in both apps back-to-back and was only cleared up after rebooting the tablet. Another fun one is the notification I get <em>every single time</em> I open up the keyboard folio that tells me to ‚Äúconfigure physical keyboard,‚Äù which brings up a menu with basically nothing you can actually configure.</p><p>Probably the most frustrating thing for me was simply trying to work across multiple apps. Pressing alt-tab brings up a view of recently-used apps, but the implementation is poor.

## Russia will continue supporting the International Space Station until 2028

<p>Russia has <a href="https://spacenews.com/russia-commits-to-iss-extension-to-2028/">formally agreed</a> to remain aboard the International Space Station (ISS) until 2028, NASA has <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/2023/04/27/partners-extend-international-space-station-for-benefit-of-humanity/">announced</a>. Yuri Borisov, the Director General of Roscosmos, previously said that the country was pulling out of the ISS after 2024 so it can focus on building its own space station. &quot;After 2024&quot; is pretty vague, though, and even Roscosmos official Sergei Krikalev said it could mean 2025, 2028 or 2030. Now, we have a more solid idea of until when Russia intends to remain a partner. To note, the United States, Japan, Canada and the participating countries of the ESA (European Space Agency) have previously agreed to keep the ISS running until 2030.&nbsp;</p><p>After the United States and other countries imposed sanctions on Russia following the invasion of Ukraine, former Roscosmos director Dmitry Rogozin <a href="https://www.engadget.com/russia-suspends-iss-cooperation-153506829.html">spoke up</a> and threatened to stop working with his agency's western counterparts. &quot;I believe that the restoration of normal relations between the partners at the International Space Station and other projects is possible only with full and unconditional removal of illegal sanctions,&quot; Rogozin said at the time.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While Roscosmos has now agreed to continue cooperating with its fellow ISS partners, the increasing tension between Russia and the US even before the invasion of Ukraine began prompted NASA to prepare for the possibility of the former leaving the space station.

It's unclear if the remaining ISS partners will use any of those contingencies after 2028 and if a private space corp will step in to keep the space station running.

<p>Reddit has announced a new feature for subreddits: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/1310lr5/changelog_chat_channels_subreddit_header_redesign/">chat channels</a>. The launch comes with a disclaimer from the company that previous Chat launches were not done &quot;in the best ways&quot; and that this approach focuses on small communities and mod tools to, ideally, be better.&nbsp;</p><p>Chat channels do differ in a few ways from the Live Chat feature, for example, existing as a permanent space in the subreddit, rather than a fleeting post. They're also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/12xps3e/making_reddit_an_even_better_place_for/">operated by the mods</a>, who can choose to block responses, pin messages and to chat in a private channel. Mods also control who's allowed in the channel, ranging from open participation all the way to only trusted members.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Mod controls for channel participation on Reddit.

The company specifically calls out features like automod rules, slow mode and the ability to build custom channel roles as potential developments.&nbsp;</p><p>The chat channels announcement came alongside two other small Reddit updates. The company has rolled out an new subreddit header that shrinks the space between the header and posts, makes the search bar into one button and shows tabs like &quot;menu&quot; and &quot;about&quot; by clicking anywhere across the header. Reddit claims these updates increased community subscriptions and actions in tests. It also announced May 9th as an official <a href="https://www.engadget.com/reddit-predictions-150040687.html">shutdown date for its Predictions</a> polling game. Users will no longer be able to create or join an active tournament and old tournaments will become inaccessible.&nbsp;</p><p>For now, chat channels are still at the pilot program stage with only 25 subreddits testing them out at the moment ‚Äî totalling less than 100,000 users. Mods interested in trying it out can add their subreddit to a participation <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/12xps3e/making_reddit_an_even_better_place_for/">waiting list</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/reddit-trials-permanent-chat-channels-in-subreddits-114548682.html?src=rss

<p>Since smartphones obliterated the casual photography market, camera manufacturers are focusing on building models designed for very specific uses. Mirrorless cameras continue to improve in autofocus, video and more, while lens ranges expand year on year. Action cams provide sharp, fluid video, compact cameras target both tourists and vloggers and DSLRs are available at some of the best prices we‚Äôve seen. We walk you through 2023‚Äôs highlights so far, including full-frame marvels, like Sony's ZV-E1, the Canon EOS R6 II and the Panasonic S5 II.

<p>Everyone loves a good to-do list, and now they're spreading into PC games. Along with a slew of other new features, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/3686801719529689368">Steam's latest update includes an integrated Notes app</a> as part of a re-vamped in-game overlay tool. It lets you write thoughts and tasks down about the game you're playing then runs on top of the game while you play, which you can access across any PC you log into and when playing offline.</p><figure><img alt="A pop up note shows things to do in a specific Steam game.

Guides, discussions and whatever is on your browser (even the show you're watching) can also be clipped to the game.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Steam's other updates to the in-game overlay include a revamped toolbar and overview. The new toolbar has everything from chat to guides, customizable depending on fields you want to see and in either icon or list mode. The game overview will fill you in on information like accomplishment progress, friends' game play and news about that title.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Notifications have also cleaned up a bit with less interruptions of things unrelated to you. The tray will only display newest notifications, but you can still view all if you want. The last in-game <a href="https://www.engadget.com/steam-will-drop-support-for-windows-7-and-windows-8-on-january-1st-2024-152437694.html">Steam update</a> is for screenshots, allowing you to choose between large and small thumbnails, while also sorting screenshots by most recent, instead of per game.&nbsp;</p><p>These features are only available through the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-21-steam-remote-play-together-beta.html">Steam Client Beta</a> at the moment, but if you‚Äôve never opted into the Beta version before, it‚Äôs pretty simple. All you need to do is go to settings (it will be called preferences if you're on a Mac), click the change button where it says Beta Participation in the Accounts tab and choose Steam Beta Update. Once you restart Steam, the Beta features will become visible.</p><p>Valve asserts that a lot of its recent work has gone towards improving code sharing between Steam Desktop Client, Deck and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-12-03-steams-big-picture-mode-makes-playing-mac-games-on-tv-more-cons.html">Big Picture mode</a>.

<p>The USS Enterprise has gone through several iterations across TV shows and movies, and now Star Trek fans can explore them as much as they want to online.

<p>Now that it's solved its supply shortages, Sony is seeing a lot of pent-up demand for PlayStation 5 consoles. The company just <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=15919d69-aefa-41ae-a977-fdcae58a803c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sony&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIxNTkxOWQ2OS1hZWZhLTQxYWUtYTk3Ny1mZGNhZTU4YTgwM2MiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc29ueS5jb20vZW4vU29ueUluZm8vSVIvbGlicmFyeS9wcmVzZW4vZXIvYXJjaGl2ZS5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiMjZhNTUwZC1kZDBlLTQyNjktOGNiOS0yYWFhYzExMzUyY2MifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAaDvj-o06cSCt5q2TWZHr34uP512HgvxkCoe8V4tifLG&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sony.com%2Fen%2FSonyInfo%2FIR%2Flibrary%2Fpresen%2Fer%2Farchive.html">announced</a> its second consecutive blockbuster quarter, selling 6.3 million PS5s ‚Äî an impressive figure in a non-holiday period ‚Äî compared to 2 million last year.

The company has now sold 38.4 million PS5s since the console was released in late 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>The news wasn't quite as good on the software side. Game sales were down to 68 million from 70.5 million a year ago, and lower for the fiscal year (264.2 million compared to 303.2 million in fiscal 2021). PlayStation Network users dropped to 108 million from 112 million the quarter before, though PS Plus subs were up very slightly.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>All of that added up to a fairly large boost in revenue in the Gaming &amp; Network Services division, up to 1.073 trillion yen ($7.9 billion) compared to 665 billion yen ($4.9 billion) the year before. Operating profit was down, though, due to a hit in foreign exchange rates. For the year, Sony hit 3.9 trillion yen in sales ($29 billion), up from 2.7 trillion yen ($19.9 billion) the year prior.&nbsp;</p><p>The company is confident that trajectory will continue into next year, forecasting a 7 percent boost in revenue for fiscal 2023.

Overall, Sony set a new fiscal year sales record with 11.5 trillion yen in sales ($84.8 billion) and 1.21 trillion yen ($8.9 billion) in profits.&nbsp;</p><p>Sony, of course, just scored a major win over its biggest rival as well.

## Canada's controversal streaming bill just became law

<p>Canada has passed its controversial streaming bill that requires Netflix, Spotify and other companies to pay to support Canadian series, music and other content, the <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/c11-online-streaming-1.6824314"><em>CBC</em></a> has reported. After clearing a final hurdle in the Senate on Thursday, Bill C-11 imposes the same content laws on streamers as it does on traditional broadcasters. The government has promised that the bill only applies to companies and not individual content creators on YouTube or other platforms.</p><p>The new rules give the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) regulator broad powers over streaming companies, which could face fines or other penalties if they don't comply with the new laws. &quot;Online streaming has changed how we create, discover, and consume our culture, and it's time we updated our system to reflect that,&quot; a Canadian government <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/news/2022/02/government-of-canada-introduces-legislation-to-support-the-next-generation-of-canadian-artists-and-creators.html">press release</a> states.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Critics have said that the bill could cause over-regulation online. &quot;Under this archaic system of censorship, government gatekeepers will now have the power to control which videos, posts and other content Canadians can see online,&quot; Canada's Conservative opposition wrote on a <a href="https://www.conservative.ca/cpc/stop-online-censorship/">web page</a> dedicated to C-11. Streaming companies like YouTube and TikTok opposed the bill as well.&nbsp;</p><p>The law has also been criticized for being overly broad, with a lack of clarity on how it will apply in some cases. &quot;The bill sets out a revised broadcasting policy for Canada, which includes an expanded list of things the Canadian broadcasting system 'should' do,&quot; a <a href="https://www.conservative.ca/cpc/stop-online-censorship/">Senate page</a> states. &quot;But precisely what this would mean in concrete terms for broadcasters is not yet known.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Canada is far from the first country to enact local content rules for streaming companies, though.

<p>NYC commuters will no longer see service alerts and other informative posts from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) on Twitter. The agency runs several accounts that provide passengers with useful real-time updates, such as whether a particular route or train has been suspended. But now it has posted a farewell message on the website, explaining that Twitter &quot;is no longer reliable for providing the consistent updates riders expect.&quot; While it didn't elaborate on why it's leaving the social network, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-27/new-york-mta-ends-twitter-service-alerts-after-musk-raises-price?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> says it was because the company was asking the MTA to fork over $50,000 a month for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-announces-new-api-pricing-including-a-limited-free-tier-for-bots-005251253.html">access to its API</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Twitter <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-shutting-off-free-api-prepare-174340770.html">shut down its old API</a>, which was completely free, earlier this year. It then launched paid access to the new version of its API, with a $100-per-month tier for hobbyists and a much higher tier for enterprise customers. The company kept pricing for enterprise vague, but <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-data-api-prices-out-nearly-everyone/"><em>Wired</em></a> had previously reported that API access could run as much as $42,000 a month. Companies and organizations other than the MTA left Twitter as a result, with Microsoft being one of the biggest names. The tech giant recently announced that it was going to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-removes-twitter-from-its-social-media-tool-for-advertisers-051717547.html">remove Twitter</a> from its free social media management tool for advertisers. Microsoft also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/you-cant-share-xbox-clips-directly-to-twitter-anymore-142026214.html">disabled the option</a> to upload screenshots directly to Twitter from Xbox consoles and from Game Bar on Windows.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Shanifah Rieara, MTA's acting chief customer officer, told <em>Bloomberg</em> that they don't think paying Twitter $50,000 a month &quot;would be the best use of resources.&quot; Especially since the MTA has other &quot;internal and homegrown&quot; avenues people could use to check for the latest updates. &quot;We want to communicate with our customers through all platforms, but we need a platform that is reliant and consistent and up to date,&quot; Rieara added.</p><p>The official MTA account is now <a href="https://twitter.com/MTA/status/1651711106862182401">encouraging</a> customers to bookmark the agency's <a href="https://new.mta.info/">official website</a>, to download its MYmta and TrainTime apps, to monitor its <a href="http://mta.info/whatsapp">WhatsApp channel</a> for subway and bus information, as well as to <a href="https://t.co/NLrVIpqa4U">sign up for email and SMS alerts</a>.&nbsp;</p><div id="0be38f3f14b149429cb56437b77db5b3"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">For the MTA, Twitter is no longer reliable for providing the consistent updates riders expect.<br /><br />So as of today, we‚Äôre saying goodbye to it for service alerts and information.<br /><br />But we're not saying goodbye to you, our customers!
