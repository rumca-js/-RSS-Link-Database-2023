Television host whose long-running talkshow focused on ordinary people and their scandals<p>For the better part of three decades, The Jerry Springer Show took the talkshow format into increasingly outlandish areas. Springer, who has died aged 79 of pancreatic cancer, presided over what amounted to a three-ring circus, as guests revealed a steady stream of betrayal in relationships they seemed to model on tawdry pulp novels and porn films.</p><p>This led to a cycle of what the writer David Sedaris described as “championship wrestling in street clothes … Curse, fight, disentangle. Curse, fight, disentangle … repeated with tedious precision”. Meanwhile, the studio audience would be pumping fists in the air, chanting “Jer-ee! Jer-ee!” while, just outside the fray, stood Springer, at once bemused by the antics and aghast at the way his guests treated each other.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/apr/28/jerry-springer-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

But the latest <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/oct/16/time-for-your-medicine-unlocking-the-power-of-our-body-clocks" title="">science of chrono-exercise</a> (sometimes called chrono-activity) suggests that what really counts isn’t what we do, or even how we do it, but when we do it.</p><p>Of course, moving at any time of the day is good. But we now know that our bodies and brains change over the course of 24 hours, with chemicals, proteins and hormones ebbing and flowing almost hour by hour. So perhaps it’s hardly surprisingly that a string of new studies suggests that timing our exercise to optimally match our body’s circadian rhythms could reap additional rewards. And that means faster results – and less time in the gym.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/28/the-secret-to-getting-more-out-of-exercise-its-not-what-you-do-its-when-you-do-it">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A lager-and-lime slushie (with orange and lemon) that’s very popular in south-east Asia</p><p>Jelly beer is a popular Thai alcoholic slushie that’s made in a <em>bia wun</em> (oscillating) machine that’s filled with ice, salt, water and beer bottles and that rocks constantly as it cools the beer – usually <a href="https://www.singha.com/">Singha</a> or <a href="https://www.changbeer.com/?lang=en">Chang</a> – down to -3C. The pressure inside the bottle prevents the beer from freezing, so in effect turns it into a bottled slushie. A citrus juice and syrup is usually then added.

<p>For those who don’t believe in the sporting concept of mental scarring, 2022-23 has been a smugness-inducing season. Arsenal, who missed out on Big Cup qualification last year after a shattering collapse, were supposed to start this season with a hangover. Instead they Tiggered their way to the top of the Premier League, staying there for almost the entire season, and ultimately what has happened in the last three weeks has got nothing to do with the narrative we’re peddling! An even more impressive – and sustained – display of bouncebackability, mind, has occurred in League One. A year ago this weekend, a wobbling Plymouth Argyle played their last league game at home to MK Dons, knowing a win would almost certainly ensure a playoff place. They lost 5-0.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/28/football-daily-email-plymouth-argyle-ipswich-town-league-one">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Pale is not always interesting when it comes to rosé wine, especially if you’re drinking it with food</p><p>Those of a certain age will remember, and possibly even recall snogging to, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJxpKlTID2Q">Procol Harum’s A Whiter Shade of Pale</a>, a song that sold 10m copies and became one of the bestselling singles of all time. Maybe it still lurks in our subconscious when we think about rosé, because there seems no other rational explanation for the unaccountable attachment we now have to its palest iteration, which more closely resembles a white wine than a pink one. There’s even a rosé called The Pale (<a href="https://www.ocado.com/products/the-pale-rose-by-sacha-lichine-by-whispering-angel-577838011">currently on offer at £10 from Ocado</a>), from the ingenious Sacha Lichine, who also created <a href="https://www.esclans.com/product/whispering-angel/">Whispering Angel</a>, one of the wines that kickstarted the whole paler-than-pale rosé trend.</p><p>Looking back, it seems counterintuitive. If rosé was at one time regarded as girlie, which it was, you’d think that prejudice would be overcome by darker rosés, rather than pale ones, but a combination of smart bottling, clever branding and the inherent glamour of Provence have made the style one that every wine producer now seems to want to emulate, not least for the price it can fetch. (Whispering Angel, which I can recall being <a href="https://wine-pages.com/tasting-articles/20022017-chateau-desclans-whispering-angel-rose-2016/">about £16-£17 in relatively recent memory</a>, now sells for <a href="https://www.majestic.co.uk/wines/whispering-angel-rose-08001">£23.99 at Majestic</a>, unless you take advantage of that store’s mix-six deal, and even then it will still cost you a relatively hefty £19.99.)</p><p>For more by Fiona Beckett, go to <a href="https://fionabeckett.substack.com/">fionabeckett.substack.com</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/apr/28/beyond-the-pale-discover-a-darker-rose">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Celtic’s superiority over their Glasgow rivals is obvious but Rangers need to stop the rot sooner rather than later</p><p>A Rangers season which began with typically lofty expectations could effectively end before May Day. Defeat by Celtic in Sunday’s Scottish Cup semi-final would extinguish the one lingering hope of silverware from a campaign during which Rangers have continued to wrestle with the frustration of being second best in a two-horse race.</p><p>Knockout football is such a fickle beast that some would rail at any assertion the winners of this Old Firm clash will lift the cup. Unfortunately the gulf between Celtic, Rangers and the rest of the top flight is stark enough without contemplating the prospects of second-tier Inverness and League One Falkirk, who meet in Saturday’s semi-final. Odds of at least 20-1 for either to win the trophy almost seem to underplay the situation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/28/scottish-cup-offers-rangers-chance-to-defy-expectations-against-celtic">Continue reading...</a>

Then we decided to start a family …</p><p>‘What if the baby comes in the night?” my wife, Allys, asked, looking at the stretch of the South China Sea that separated us from the nearest hospital. “Helicopter,” said a local resident. I looked around me, taking in the thick jungle of trees and roots, crisscrossed with tiny paths, impenetrable to vehicles. “Where’s it going to land?” The man cleared his throat and shrugged. “Better if the baby does not come in the night.”</p><p>Three years earlier, in 2015, we had moved to Hong Kong as a pair of young teachers, excited about escaping the grey skies and terrible pay of the UK. Frankly, we were a little bored, and were certain that we wanted to travel across the globe and perhaps never return to the UK, at least not to live.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/28/giant-spiders-snakes-storms-having-a-baby-on-remote-jungle-island">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The actor’s sensitive reading brings Forster’s long-unpublished novel to life</p><p>Maurice opens with the eponymous schoolboy taking a walk with his prep school teacher, Mr Ducie. Maurice has grown up without a father, so Mr Ducie takes it upon himself to explain the “mystery of sex” and how the boy will one day settle down and marry. Maurice listens intently since “he knew the subject was serious and related to his own body. But he could not himself relate it; it fell to pieces as soon as Mr Ducie put it together, like an impossible sum.”</p><p>The book subsequently follows Maurice through public school and into adulthood, during which he struggles to come to terms with his sexuality. At Cambridge, he befriends Clive Durham, a Greek scholar with whom he has an affair. After Clive leaves him to marry a woman, Maurice visits a hypnotist hoping to be cured of his “congenital homosexuality”. Later, as a guest of Clive and his wife, Anne, in their country pile, he meets and begins an affair with the Durhams’ gamekeeper, Alec.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/28/maurice-by-em-forster-audiobook-review-ben-whishaw-narrates-a-groundbreaking-gay-novel">Continue reading...</a>

It also shortens the amount of time the groups have to turn in any voter registration applications they collect from 14 days to 10. The bill makes it illegal for non-citizens and people convicted of certain felonies to “collect or handle” voter registration applications on behalf of third-party groups. Groups would also have to give each voter they register a receipt and be required to register themselves with the state ahead of each general election cycle.

<p><strong>(Platoon)</strong><br />The singer-songwriter elevates his reimagining of Xhosa folk music with synth-pop hooks and his melismatic voice</p><p>Over the past decade, South African singer-songwriter Bongeziwe Mabandla has been reimagining Xhosa folk music. His 2012 debut album, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6OYXsbDBHJeiurDkHCuSXs?si=KTkS3EXzTLOD_oydWWvcZA">Umlilo</a>, was a largely acoustic effort, combining the genre’s yearning choral harmonies with finger-strumming guitar and an underlying sense of jazz swing; five years later, on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1fXiO7h7dDB3RBG13jLh8A?si=-cMi1i7_RaqTjdIIsr6ksA">Mangaliso</a>, he introduced electronic rhythms, which pulsated beneath his lyrics on love and loss and propelled the dancefloor stomp of his most popular song to date, <a href="https://youtu.be/vk31Zpi72e0">Ndokulandela</a>. Following the heartbreak-fuelled introspection of 2020’s <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/08SJ9H5uec4YtEm2izy1XN?si=YdQzPQDxRIOaM-T7wOBrSg">Iimini</a>, amaXesha (or The Times) vaults to the other end of the scale as his most expansive and wide-ranging record to date. Across its 14 tracks, Mabandla fuses Xhosa lyrics with electronic ambience, hook-laden synth melody and acoustic simplicity.</p><p>Opening on the plaintive guitar melody of Sisahleleleni (i), Mabandla’s delicate vocal builds to an anthemic chorus, which undulates through synth processing. The blend of acoustic and electronic continues on standout Ukuthanda Wena, where his strumming weaves through an arpeggiated synth, developing the feel of Ndokulandela to gesture towards the melodic electronica of producers such as Bonobo.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/28/bongeziwe-mabandla-amaxesha-review">Continue reading...</a>

The role of increased profits in the cost of living crisis remains a relatively neglected topic: sporadically raised by leftwing activists, business analysts and economists, occasionally the reason for protests, but largely avoided by the main parties, and seemingly not a consistently important issue for the wider public.

<p>In public she oozed glamour, but in private the disco star battled depression, self-loathing and suicidal thoughts. Her daughter speaks about the film she made to understand Summer’s silent struggle</p><p>In a New York hotel room in 1976, Donna Summer stepped towards the window ledge. She had become instantly famous the previous year for her pseudo-orgasmic vocals on her single Love to Love You Baby, which had reached No 2 in the US and Top 10 across most of Europe. But, unknown to her fans, she was horribly conflicted over the sexualised performance, and also in the grip of a violently abusive relationship. She began climbing up.</p><p>“Another 10 seconds and I would have been gone,” she later said – but her foot became entangled in a curtain and at that moment a maid entered. “I felt God could never forgive me because I had failed him,” she explained. “I was decadent, I was stupid, I was a fool.
