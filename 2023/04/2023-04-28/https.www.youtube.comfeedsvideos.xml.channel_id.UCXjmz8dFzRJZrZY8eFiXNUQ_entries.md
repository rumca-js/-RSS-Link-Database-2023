The James Bond franchise has had it's share of ups and downs throughout it's 60 year run.  Each time a new 007 is brought in the tone of the franchise seems to shift.  None bigger though when Pierce Brosnan took up the mantle as James Bond in Goldeneye.   Seemingly saving the franchise and breathing life into Bond, it would only take a few more installments for Brosnan to almost destroy the James Bond legacy.
