It works by issuing an authentication code on your phone when somebody tries to access the account; if that person doesn\u2019t have the code, they (or you) don\u2019t get in. By using a 2FA app, such as Google Authenticator or Authy, you can prevent somebody from accessing your data by getting your password. (You can have a code texted to you, but that is considered far less secure <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/11/18564381/community-hacking-sim-hijacking-cryptocurrency\">due to the rise of so-called SIM hacking</a>.)</p>\n<p id=\"ag7DRC\">Google Authenticator lets you establish 2FA by using your phone to scan a QR code generated by the app on a separate device or by entering a key code.
