The company has <a href=\"https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-dvd-the-final-season\">revealed</a> that it will &quot;wind down&quot; DVD rentals (that is. DVD.com), with its last movie discs mailing on September 29th. Simply put, the shrinking demand for physical rentals is making it &quot;increasingly difficult&quot; to offer the quality of service the company wants.</p><p>Netflix shipped its first disc (<em>Beetlejuice</em>, if you're curious) in 1998. It has since mailed over 5.2 billion movies in its signature envelopes (nearly all of them <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-26-netflix-has-shipped-5-billion-discs.html\">before 2019</a>) to more than 40 million customers. You likely know the story after that. The company began streaming on-demand video in 2007, and that business grew quickly enough that it became Netflix's most popular offering by 2009. After a premature attempt to spin off the mailed rentals <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2011-10-10-netflix-backtracks-on-qwikster-will-keep-dvds-and-streaming-und.html\">as Qwikster in 2011,</a> Netflix moved them to DVD.com in 2016. By that point, the company was well into producing original streaming shows and had <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2014-07-14-netflix-stops-mailing-dvds-on-saturdays.html\">stopped mailing DVDs on Saturdays</a>.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>There's also a financial incentive to drop disc rentals. While Netflix <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/netflix-reed-hastings-steps-down-ceo-211808104.html\">is recovering</a> from a bleak 2022, its profits in the first quarter <a href=\"https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2023/q1/Final-Q1-23-Shareholder-Letter.pdf\">were still worse</a> than they were a year ago. Subscriber growth was relatively modest, too, at 1.7 million new users. A decision to axe the DVD-by-mail unit could help Netflix trim costs, even if the savings are relatively small. The disc market has been on a sharp and steady decline for years, <a href=\"https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1658828396\">according</a> to VideoScan/MediaPlayNews data \u2014 sales alone dropped 19 percent from 2021 to 2022.</p><p>It's nonetheless a sad moment for home video fans. Netflix played a major role in shaking up the movie rental business. Where retailers <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-07-last-blockbuster-in-australia-closing.html\">like Blockbuster</a> dominated in the 1990s and early 2000s, Netflix helped people stay at home. Blockbuster and other rivals hopped into the market years later but fought to gain traction. While retail rentals are still available through <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/redbox-new-owner-chicken-soup-for-the-soul-201409302.html\">Redbox</a> kiosks and similar options, it's safe to say Netflix changed expectations for good.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/netflix-will-shut-down-its-dvd-rental-business-in-september-195213827.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/netflix-will-shut-down-its-dvd-rental-business-in-september-195213827.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-18 19:52:13+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Meta's Horizon Worlds is opening to young teens in the US and Canada", "description": "<p>Months <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/meta-open-horizon-worlds-younger-teens-march-131930554.html\">later than rumored</a>, Meta's Horizon Worlds is <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2023/04/horizon-worlds-teen-expansion-us-canada/\">opening</a> its doors to younger teens.

They can also allow or block apps, track usage and see who's following who.

The company appears to be moving forward with <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-mixed-reality-headset-wwdc-2023-announcement-221042779.html\">plans to announce</a> its first VR / AR headset at its Worldwide Developers\u2019 Conference in June.</p><p>The Apple mixed reality headset (rumored to be named <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-appears-to-have-registered-reality-trademarks-for-its-upcoming-ar-headset-093742126.html\">\u201cReality One\u201d or \u201cReality Pro\u201d</a>) can allegedly switch between virtual and augmented reality. It will focus heavily on gaming, fitness, sports and collaboration tools. Customers who buy the device can use \u201cmillions\u201d of existing apps in the headset\u2019s 3D interface \u201cwith slight modifications\u201d from developers. Additionally, Apple has reportedly been working with \u201ca small number of developers\u201d for months to optimize apps for the new product. Announcing the device months before its launch should also give other developers time to create new apps or adapt existing ones for its futuristic interface.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Although many of the product\u2019s details have leaked before, a new morsel in this report is its ability to run <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-fitness-plus-review-two-weeks-test-watch-music-workout-160058155.html\">Apple Fitness+</a> workouts in VR. (Imagine a virtual workout where you feel like you\u2019re in the same space as the instructor.) In addition, it will allegedly support immersive sports viewing, leveraging the company\u2019s streaming rights for Major League Soccer and Major League Baseball, as well as its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-buys-nextvr-192608476.html\">2020 purchase</a> of VR sports startup NextVR. Likewise, the Apple TV app will let you watch videos in virtual environments like a desert or the sky.</p><p>The report says the headset will have a productivity focus, similar to the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/meta-quest-pro-review-a-next-gen-headset-for-the-vr-faithful-specs-price-130045313.html\">Meta Quest Pro</a>. \u201cThe platform will support its Pages word processing, Numbers spreadsheet and Keynote slide deck apps, as well as iMovie and GarageBand for video and music production,\u201d writes Gurman. It would also prioritize communication and remote collaboration, letting users see <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-mixed-reality-headset-headset-full-body-renders-facetime-202004300.html\">full-body 3D avatars</a> of people they're talking with in FaceTime calls. Gaming will also be a primary focus. However, that wasn't always the case, as today's report says that Apple previously wasn't putting as much attention into that space.</p><p>Gurman also reiterates earlier reporting about the headset, including a Digital Crown like the one on the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-ultra-review-battery-life-compass-gps-hike-130055477.html\">Apple Watch</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/airpods-max-review-143019326.html\">AirPods Max</a> headphones that lets you switch between VR (fully immersive, no real-world view) and AR (using cameras to combine your real environment and virtual elements). It would support running multiple apps simultaneously, \u201cfloating within the mixed-reality interface.\u201d It could also remember where you were in your physical environment, leaving virtual elements in the same spot you left them. (We saw that feature as far back as the first <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2016-02-29-microsoft-hololens-developer-preorders.html\">HoloLens developer kit</a> in 2016.)</p><p>The headset would also let you control it with eye gestures that determine where you\u2019re looking and hand gestures like finger pinches to select items and navigate menus. In addition, it will have an in-air virtual keyboard and support physical keyboards for a more tactile typing experience. Its home screen could appear similar to the iPad\u2019s with Apple\u2019s familiar Control Center for toggling things like WiFi, Bluetooth and volume. Finally, it will support Siri voice control and use eye scans for security, acting as the device\u2019s equivalent to Face ID and Touch ID.</p><p>Although the product will supply a robust feature set that will elicit curiosity, other companies have tried similar things but have yet to succeed. For example, although the cheaper Meta Quest VR headsets have done reasonably well as gaming devices, the more expensive Meta Quest Pro \u2014 with a similar mixed reality focus and productivity apps \u2014 has been a tougher sell to consumers. And Apple\u2019s version will reportedly cost around three times as much \u2014 a staggering $3,000. On the other hand, Apple\u2019s history requires us to keep a somewhat open mind: There were MP3 players before the iPod, smartphones before the iPhone and smartwatches before the Apple Watch. Those competing devices all had similar features but failed to capture the public\u2019s imagination in the same way as Apple\u2019s stylish and user-friendly variants.</p><p>Even if the product targets a niche audience, it could serve a purpose as a consumer-facing transition product pointing toward an eventual pair of AR glasses that passes for a regular pair of prescription frames. Seen by many in the industry as the holy grail of mixed reality, such a device could be worn all day out in the world, while the upcoming mixed reality headset expected in June would not.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/latest-apple-headset-rumors-say-itll-include-vr-workouts-and-sports-192316389.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/latest-apple-headset-rumors-say-itll-include-vr-workouts-and-sports-192316389.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-18 19:23:16+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Designing for a better future: Framlab\u2019s vision for urban architecture", "description": "<p>When it comes to sustainability, cities represent both the problem and the solution.

I stumbled upon Breville\u2019s dedicated pizza oven a while ago at the suggestion of a colleague, but it was a bit outside of our coverage area to review. Now that we have an annual week of kitchen-focused reviews, buyer\u2019s guides and how-tos, it was time to finally put a Pizzaiolo through its paces for this website.</p><p>Breville\u2019s Pizzaiolo may look a bit like its toaster ovens, but the larger unit is designed for one thing: pizza. From handy presets to a full manual mode for advanced users, this oven offers just about anything you\u2019d want \u2013 so long as your pizzas are round and 12-inches or smaller. But even with all of its cooking chops, is the Pizzaiolo worth the nearly $1,000 price tag? Or perhaps the better question is: Do you really need a dedicated pizza oven <em>inside </em>your house?</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p></p><h2>Design</h2><figure><img alt=\"Breville\u2019s dedicated pizza oven can cook some great pizza and it looks more like something you\u2019d want to keep in your kitchen.

While the awkward cleaning and confined baking area are frustrating, the price will be the dealbreaker for most people. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/e0c09720-dd7a-11ed-bb5b-f6f3288db646\" style=\"height: 1333px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>The Pizzaiolo looks like many other Breville countertop appliances. Available in stainless steel and black finishes, the pizza oven has a design akin to the company\u2019s multi-function toaster ovens and air fryers \u2013 namely <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c0ca87c7-692e-4b52-8410-9ea74ef1a5a6&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Breville&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjMGNhODdjNy02OTJlLTRiNTItODQxMC05ZWE3NGVmMWE1YTYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnJldmlsbGUuY29tL3VzL2VuL3Byb2R1Y3RzL292ZW5zLmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjMwOGEwYmY1LTczYmMtNGVmMC05M2MwLThlNWQzNDJiMDg0MSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQ7EBG0Nt-62GUxQvnaj8CSzRJcg0DdW5Wr16cuFTFpb&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.breville.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fproducts%2Fovens.html\">the Smart Oven line</a>. At 18.1 x 18.5 inches though, the Pizzaiolo is much bigger than all of those compact kitchen accessories. Like Breville\u2019s Smart Oven lineup, this pizza-focused model has a silver door handle up top, though the one here is more robust than what\u2019s on the smaller ovens. There\u2019s also a wide viewing window that allows you to observe the cooking area from edge to edge.</p><p>All of the controls are on the front, situated at the bottom right. Two large main dials control the timer and style presets while a tiny third selector lets you adjust the \u201cDarkness\u201d or power of the top heating element. There are also two lights: one to indicate you\u2019re in manual mode and one that glows when the oven has reached your desired temperature and blinks slowly while it\u2019s  preheating. Manual mode lets you control the temperature of both the top and bottom heating elements independently, rather than relying on Breville\u2019s style presets. The company includes a magnet that lays over the time numbers and preset labels so you know what temps you\u2019ve chosen for manual mode.</p><p>Inside, the 12-inch cooking area is a round stone that doesn\u2019t quite go all the way to the sides of the cooking area. The Pizzaiolo has reflectors around the baking stone that send heat from the top heating element to the crust. This means you can only use the oven for pizza or things baked in smaller round pans since there isn\u2019t any extra room to work with. There also isn\u2019t an interior light to help you see how things are progressing. However, Breville says the radiant heat is controlled by the oven so you don\u2019t need to worry about rotating pizzas for even cooking. Lastly, the deck that holds the stone is connected to the door, so when you open it, the cooking surface moves closer to you. This makes launching and removing pizzas slightly easier.</p><h2>Setup and use</h2><figure><img alt=\"Breville\u2019s dedicated pizza oven can cook some great pizza and it looks more like something you\u2019d want to keep in your kitchen. Presets for popular styles are great for beginners or when you want a no-fuss pizza party, but the manual mode provides an endless playground for tinkering. While the awkward cleaning and confined baking area are frustrating, the price will be the dealbreaker for most people. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/e0cec7f0-dd7a-11ed-9dbe-177fe63c0f40\" style=\"height: 1333px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Before you use the Pizzaiolo for the first time, you\u2019ll need to wipe down the inside and the top of the stone with a damp cloth or sponge. Once everything is dry, you have to run the oven wide open at 750 degrees Fahrenheit for 20 minutes to season it. When the time is up, the Pizzaiolo is ready to cook your first pie. By default, the style selector picks all of the oven settings for you, so you make the choice there first and the recommended time will show on the other dial automatically. Of course, you can adjust this as needed.</p><p>Depending on the style and temperature, Breville says the preheating process can take up to 20 minutes. I only timed this on the hottest possible option \u2013 750 degrees \u2013 since it would take the longest. The Pizzaiolo took 17 minutes to reach that number. When you turn the oven off, the fan will run for another 15 minutes to cool the \u201csensitive electronics.\u201d</p><p>One thing that\u2019s nice about the Pizzaiolo is that the outside stays relatively cool during the cooking process. Breville says this is due to the double-pane front window and \u201cmulti-material insulation\u201d that keeps as much of the heat inside as possible. Indeed, the top stays cool to the touch when in use, but the bottom of the sides where the vents are located and the door (not the handle) get hot.</p><p>The only issue I had was a small fire from excess semolina on the bottom of one pie. It wasn\u2019t a big deal as it went out quickly and wasn\u2019t all that big, but it left a mess on the stone I didn\u2019t want to put another pizza on top of. With outdoor ovens from Ooni, for example, this would just burn off and you\u2019d use a brush to push the extra burned bits to the side or rake them to the front.</p><p>On the Pizzaiolo, there\u2019s nowhere to brush any debris as the opening around the stone goes underneath it where the heating element resides. The fact that the cooking deck is attached to the door also makes sweeping out any bits difficult. Even when the oven is off the inside is awkward to clean since the interior isn\u2019t very tall. In a few spots, it\u2019s hard to see the grime you might\u2019ve missed.</p><h2>Making the pizza</h2><figure><img alt=\"Breville Pizzaiolo\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/6e4f7390-dd7b-11ed-b5df-98829e622222\" style=\"height: 1333px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption>Ooni's classic pizza dough recipe cooked on the \"Wood Fired\" preset.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Breville\u2019s presets come in handy when you just want to make good pizza and not worry about the exact numbers for time and temp. As promised, the full-heat and \u201cWood Fired\u201d options produce the leoparding that\u2019s desired for Neapolitan-style pizza. The former option also adjusts the top heating element so that just the outer crust is getting direct heat during baking (pictured in the gallery below). I was also impressed by the even cooking on the New York setting, where the crust and toppings were evenly cooked but there was still a pleasant chewiness to the bite.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest surprise was the Frozen option, which puts the stone at 425-475 degrees and the top at 350-400 with even heat for the Darkness. In full disclosure, I splurged on Newman\u2019s Own stone-fired pizzas which are supposedly imported from Italy, but the results were seriously impressive. The Pizzaiolo also did well on thin cauliflower crust pies from Milton\u2019s \u2013 a Steele family favorite.</p><h2>The competition</h2><p>An alternative to the Pizzaiolo is <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ooni-volt-12-review-180019262.html\">the Ooni Volt 12</a>. It\u2019s much larger than the Breville pizza oven, but it does have a square stone that gives you a bit more versatility. There\u2019s also an interior light that stays on the whole time so you can see clearly what\u2019s happening inside. The Volt 12 looks a lot like Ooni\u2019s recent outdoor ovens with completely manual controls that give you the ability to select an exact temperature and manage the balance between the top and bottom heating elements. What\u2019s more, Ooni includes a boost feature that can get the stone back to your desired temp in about 45 seconds. Like the Pizzaiolo, though, the big downside is cost as the Volt 12 is $999.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>You don\u2019t need a dedicated pizza oven to make great pizza at home. With some affordable accessories like a baking stone or steel, you can cook excellent pies inside the main oven in your kitchen. There are also tons of more affordable wood- and gas-burning outdoor options. <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c0ca87c7-692e-4b52-8410-9ea74ef1a5a6&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Breville&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjMGNhODdjNy02OTJlLTRiNTItODQxMC05ZWE3NGVmMWE1YTYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnJldmlsbGUuY29tL3VzL2VuL3Byb2R1Y3RzL292ZW5zL2JwejgyMC5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzMDhhMGJmNS03M2JjLTRlZjAtOTNjMC04ZTVkMzQyYjA4NDEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVncuo65M0ypFOsAYkxZ6iOvViRSxVntVJyUu4KhDrWu&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.breville.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fproducts%2Fovens%2Fbpz820.html\">Breville\u2019s Pizzaiolo</a> does offer a lot of tools for cooking pizza, from the convenient presets to the full manual mode for endlessly adjusting the variables. That Frozen setting alone is no joke. Since it\u2019s slightly smaller than Ooni\u2019s Volt 12, and looks more like a kitchen appliance, I could see the Pizzaiolo permanently sitting on someone\u2019s counter. You\u2019d have to really love making pizza at home though, and even then, the price will be prohibitive for most.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/breville-pizzaiolo-review-150020198.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/breville-pizzaiolo-review-150020198.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-18 15:00:20+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "'Mrs. Davis' review: Damon Lindelof's nun vs. AI show is a campy blast", "description": "<p><em>Mrs. Davis</em> is a deeply silly show deeply committed its silliness. And that's precisely what makes it so much fun. The new Peacock series from Tara Hernandez (<em>The Big Bang Theory)</em> and Damon Lindelof (<em>Lost, The Leftovers</em>), pits a nun with a mysterious past against an all-powerful, seemingly omniscient artificial intelligence. Her mission: to find the Holy Grail. You know, another one of <em>those</em> stories. Along the way, there are a slew of messy beheadings, a cheesy '90s-era car chase and a group of villainous German henchman spiritually descended from <em>The Big Lebowski's </em>trio of Nihilists.</p><p>If you were looking for another complex genre exercise like Lindelof's excellent <em>Watchmen</em> series or <em>The Leftovers, Mrs. Davis </em>ain't it. But from the first scene of the show, you can tell that he probably had a lot more fun making this. Initially based on a spec script by Hernandez, who also served as showrunner, <em>Mrs. Davis</em> is practically a live-action cartoon, filled with colorful set-pieces and a never-ending slew of zany characters, all set in a world where humans willingly subject themselves to the demands of an AI via wireless earbuds.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"cc2a0b847ad74116a616eb96cb463e24\"></div><p>None of <em>Mrs. Davis</em> would work without Betty Gilpin (<em>GLOW, The Hunt</em>) as its heart and soul. As Simone, the nun being targeted by Mrs. Davis, she effectively juggles a hard-edged cynicism with an openness to pure devotion. It's hard enough to be a believable action lead, it's even tougher to make that same character seem believably devout. By the time we see Simone racing through city streets on a motorcycle, while also wearing her nun habit, we fully buy Gilpin in the role. It's like seeing Kill Bill's The Bride with a samurai sword \u2014 it's sure to be an indelible pop cultural image. (And of course, it hearkens back to Abel Ferrara's cult revenge classic, <em>Ms. 45.)</em></p><p>As a piece of cultural commentary, <em>Mrs. Davis</em> is practically <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=89f68c82-f255-44fa-8db9-03fec996b93a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YouTube&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4OWY2OGM4Mi1mMjU1LTQ0ZmEtOGRiOS0wM2ZlYzk5NmI5M2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1XVnBhUEZUV3VTMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNjc1Mjk1ZmUtYjFmMC00YzdmLWJkYmYtODJjMjM2MWU5NDZmIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAZcEBAWqYuWJo16Udu1G-OnLH5YqrYTogd2OjWjv982d&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DWVpaPFTWuS0\">allergic to subtext</a>. It's a nun versus AI, what else do you need? It's easy to draw parallels between religious devotion and the way we live with technology today. That's particularly true when it comes to the explosive rise of generative AI. Is there really a huge difference between plugging in a string into ChatGPT or Midjourney and hoping for an interesting result, compared to putting your hands together and praying for divine help? And if AI ultimately ends up fulfilling our needs more effectively, wouldn't people treat it with a certain amount of religious reverence?</p><p>These questions danced around my head as I watched <em>Mrs. Davis</em>, but the series itself is far more interested in goofy shenanigans and soapy plot twists than attempting any serious philosophical exploration. But I suppose even Damon Lindelof needs a vacation sometimes. Your enjoyment of the show will depend on well you sync up with its farcical wavelength. Why is there a group of well-funded, anti-AI militia bros, led by a shirtless buffoon?

During that time of sheer uncertainty \u2014 back when we were still wiping down groceries \u2014 Hernandez wished for an app that could just tell her what to do. \"What if there was something that we trusted?\" Lindelof said. He was also intrigued by the role of algorithms in our lives, something he noticed while going down YouTube and Tiktok rabbit holes with his teenage son.</p><p><em>Mrs. Davis</em> was written and produced long before ChatGPT and other generative AI tools reached the public, but its release couldn't be better timed. Despite just making a show about an all-powerful algorithm, Lindelof is intrigued by the new AI tools. \"Artificial intelligence is basically coded to give us what we want,\" he said. \"And so, never before in the history of of technology have we had more of an opportunity to get clarity on what it is we want.... What is human existence? What is the meaning of life?\"</p><figure><img alt=\"Mrs. Davis on Peacock\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/5b111ef0-ddf8-11ed-9bfe-a3a25b352c70\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Peacock</div></figure><p>If <em>Mrs. Davis</em> more effectively wrestled with those questions, it would have been another prestigious series for Lindelof.

While this isn't the lowest price we've seen, it's within $5, and it represents a roughly $10 drop from the 2-quart air fryer's typical street price. Just note the deal only applies to the aqua blue model.</p><p></p><p>As a refresher, an air fryer works like a smaller, pod-shaped convection oven. It can cook smaller foods better than a microwave, and it's typically faster and more energy-efficient than a traditional oven. The Vortex Mini is among the most compact models we've tested, so it can't cook a ton of food at once, but we've found it to perform well for single servings and side dishes like french fries, tofu, pizza slices or roasted veggies. It has four preprogrammed buttons \u2014 air fry, bake, roast and reheat \u2014 and we generally found it simple to operate. Because it's only about a foot tall and nine inches wide, it doesn't take up much countertop space, nor is it a hassle to clean. All of this makes the Vortex Mini a decent accessory for those living in smaller spaces who mainly cook for themselves.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>This deal comes as part of a <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAARzerV3YVRgxDUxWsGOvfsP8XZ29UExGZUp6BLn17FL6&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdeal%2F63e50f82%3FshowVariations%3Dtrue%26pf_rd_r%3DWVGS53YZVN0HWEDZNR1T%26pf_rd_t%3DEvents%26pf_rd_i%3Ddeals%26pf_rd_p%3D20e1df82-4248-432f-be98-72ac552676e3%26pf_rd_s%3Dslot-15%26ref%3Ddlx_deals_gd_dcl_img_1_63e50f82_dt_sl15_e3\">couple</a> of <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAARWzvfzh6lVQ6OwpVY9_SDdQYw2rFCJ1fr47wA2peGlG&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdeal%2F7363450e%3FshowVariations%3Dtrue%26pf_rd_r%3D59ATBN1HR2RR30CV9JRP%26pf_rd_t%3DEvents%26pf_rd_i%3Ddeals%26pf_rd_p%3D20e1df82-4248-432f-be98-72ac552676e3%26pf_rd_s%3Dslot-15%26ref%3Ddlx_deals_gd_dcl_img_5_7363450e_dt_sl15_e3\">wider sales</a> on Instant kitchen accessories at Amazon.

It was a daily part of life for five years when I lived off-grid. Granted, we were composting <a href=\"https://humanurehandbook.com/\">more</a> than just food, but I got to know carbon/nitrogen ratios, ideal moisture levels, proper aeration and everything else that distinguishes a healthy compost pile from an unpleasant mass of rot. Now as a city dweller, I still believe in composting and continue to do it \u2013 but no longer in my backyard.</p><p>Each person in the US throws away about <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/food-material-specific-data#FoodOverview\">200 pounds</a> of food per year on average. Once it hits a landfill, food waste does bad stuff, like releasing methane and contributing to <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/food-waste-is-contributing-to-climate-change-whats-being-done-about-it\">climate change</a>, instead of good stuff, like <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sustainable-management-food/reducing-impact-wasted-food-feeding-soil-and-composting#:~:text=Compost%20improves%20soil%20structure%20and,the%20need%20for%20chemical%20fertilizers.\">improving the soil</a> and acting as a <a href=\"https://calrecycle.ca.gov/organics/compostmulch/toolbox/carbonsequest/\">carbon sink</a>. Composting solves those problems, and many cities are starting to realize it helps them with waste management, too. Nine of the 20 largest metro areas in the US now have <a href=\"https://calrecycle.ca.gov/organics/slcp/collection/\">some form</a> of <a href=\"https://www.boston.gov/departments/public-works/curbside-food-waste-collection\">residential</a><a href=\"https://www.seattle.gov/utilities/your-services/collection-and-disposal/food-and-yard/compost-right\">compost</a><a href=\"https://www.minneapolismn.gov/resident-services/garbage-recycling-cleanup/organics-recycling/\">service</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nyc.gov/assets/dsny/site/services/food-scraps-and-yard-waste-page/composting-residents-organics\">or will in the next year</a> or so. But if you live elsewhere and want to stop putting your food scraps in the trash, it\u2019s up to you. You have three main options: compost in your backyard, buy a machine or pay someone to do it for you.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><h2>How to compost at home</h2><p>It\u2019s tempting to think of composting as building a holder, throwing in food and coming back a few weeks later to something you can toss in your garden, but the reality requires much more time, space and effort. For me, the toughest part of composting was the consistency it required. At least a few times per week, any active compost pile needs tending, including adding to it, turning it, watering it in dry climates or shielding it from excess rain. In addition to time, home composting requires the space and materials to build the bins. You\u2019ll also need a regular source of \u201cbrown\u201d or carbon-rich materials like dried leaves, untreated paper, cardboard, sawdust or wood chips.</p><p>Plenty of people (with more knowledge than I) have put together how-tos on the subject.

Of course, if the process appeals to you (and it <em>is</em> pretty fascinating) that\u2019s not a drawback. Gardeners in particular, who are out in the yard anyway, make excellent candidates for keeping up healthy piles \u2014 not to mention, they also have the most use for the finished product. People without yards, however, are out of luck (unless they\u2019re comfortable hosting <a href=\"https://www.mass.gov/doc/massdep-fact-sheet-vermicomposting-indoor-composting-with-worms/download\">an indoor worm farm</a>).</p><figure><img alt=\"A bowl of food scraps sits on a blue and white countertop next to a ceramic canister. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/1e106ef0-d58a-11ed-bfee-55e5d12e9854\" style=\"height: 1200px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Amy Skorheim / Engadget</div></figure><h2>Kitchen composting machines</h2><p>Calling them \u201ccomposters\u201d is a misnomer, since these devices don\u2019t actually create compost \u2013 that requires microbial processes that take weeks. Instead, these appliances chop and dehydrate food, creating an odor-free material that\u2019s substantially smaller in volume than what went in. You can even include meat and dairy \u2013 an advantage over home compost piles in which animal products are generally not recommended. As for what comes out, it can be added to your backyard pile, spread in your garden, added to houseplants or thrown in the green bin or trash \u2013 where it will take up less room and won\u2019t stink anything up.</p><p>I haven't tested any of these devices, but after researching from the perspective of a fairly informed composter, here\u2019s what I see as the pros and cons of a few of the more popular devices on the market.</p><h3><a href=\"https://mill.com/\"><strong>Mill</strong></a><strong> ($33 - $45 per month)</strong></h3><p>I like that Mill offers a solution for the substance it produces and that it\u2019s large enough to hold the scraps an average family might generate over the course of a few weeks. Instead of buying the machine outright, you sign up for a subscription, which includes the Mill bin and UPS pickup for the \u201cgrounds\u201d it creates. Add food throughout the day and the dehydration, chopping and mixing cycles run automatically each night. Once it's full, you empty the contents into a prepaid box and ship it to Mill who will then turn the grounds into food for chickens.</p><p>Mill is in the pre-order phase, and according to the <a href=\"https://mill.com/faq/membership\">FAQs</a>, the company hasn't yet worked through the \u201cscientific and regulatory processes\u201d for producing chicken feed. The service also costs $45 per month, unless you pay annually, then it works out to $33 monthly.</p><h3><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2xvbWkuY29tL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2xvbWktY29tcG9zdGVyLTM0OS1vZmZlciIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYWNiNmJjNDItOTEzMC00NmJjLWFiNTctYWNlYjBjNDg0YjUyIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAe4R8qTWfRjoVe8EhUNA5RhTBp2y8ZWWU8bLHOzYK7rx&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Flomi.com%2Fproducts%2Flomi-composter-349-offer\"><strong>Lomi</strong></a><strong> ($369 - $749)</strong></h3><p>Lomi also chops and dehydrates your scraps. The unit is smaller than the Mill, so you\u2019ll likely have to empty it every few days. It offers three modes, one of which, Grow Mode, uses small capsules of probiotics called Lomi Pods to create \u201cplant food\u201d in about 20 hours. Lomi suggests mixing the results with regular soil at a ratio of one to ten.</p><p>If you have a yard, it\u2019s easy enough to add a little here and there to maintain the ratio, and if you\u2019re an apartment dweller with houseplants you can mix small amounts into the soil. But the end product should only be used sparingly, like a fertilizer, so you\u2019ll probably need to do something else with the excess. Lomi suggests giving the excess away or dropping it into your green bin if your city provides curbside compost pickup.</p><h3><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4052d411-fe73-431e-851f-5cfdc282e4c1&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Vitamix&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0MDUyZDQxMS1mZTczLTQzMWUtODUxZi01Y2ZkYzI4MmU0YzEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudml0YW1peC5jb20vdXMvZW5fdXMvc2hvcC9mb29kY3ljbGVyLWZjLTUwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhY2I2YmM0Mi05MTMwLTQ2YmMtYWI1Ny1hY2ViMGM0ODRiNTIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZ0AjGouTtoANgjLAhv2Sde0VTvF2wrhxUpwTw-WZzHF&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vitamix.com%2Fus%2Fen_us%2Fshop%2Ffoodcycler-fc-50\"><strong>Vitamix FoodCycler</strong></a><strong> ($400)</strong></h3><p>All of these devices are basically blenders with a heating element, so it makes sense that Vitamix has a unit on the market. The FoodCycler is smaller than the Lomi, so it\u2019s probably best for households with one or two people. The results can be mixed sparingly into plants, added to your green bins or thrown out. Whichever way, the processed scraps will stink less, take up less space and won\u2019t add more methane rot to a landfill.</p><h3><a href=\"https://reencle.co/\"><strong>Reencle</strong></a><strong> ($700)</strong></h3><p>Reencle is larger like the Mill bin, and involves microorganisms in the process like Lomi. You can buy it outright or rent it for $30 per month, but that doesn\u2019t include pickup for the results. I like that Reencle is, in essence, a living pile of fermentation, using low heat, grinders and a regenerating bacterial population to break down your food scraps.</p><p>Adding scraps daily \u201cfeeds\u201d the pile, and when it\u2019s full, you\u2019re only supposed to remove about half of what\u2019s in there, leaving the rest to breed more Bacilli. Again, the material works as a plant food or fertilizer, not like standard compost. Reencle recommends a byproduct-to-soil ratio of one part to four, and that you let the mixture sit for five days before adding to your monsteras and gardens.</p><figure><img alt=\"A green, square compost bucket sits on wooden steps.

Countertop machines are expensive and, from what users say, noisy and often unreliable. Both methods leave you to figure out what to do with the byproduct, whether it\u2019s the finished compost from your bins or the dehydrated proto-compost from the appliances.</p><p>If you\u2019re a gardener, you\u2019re golden \u2013 compost makes plants happy. But I\u2019ve tried farming and now I\u2019d rather ride my bike to the burrito stand than grow my own food. Since I don\u2019t live in a city that offers municipal curbside organics pickup, I pay for a <a href=\"https://littlegreenbucket.com/\">local service</a> and I recommend it.</p><p>Most subscription-based compost pick-up services work the same way: for a monthly fee, they provide you with a bucket and lid. You fill the bucket with leftovers and set it on your front porch/steps/stoop on pickup day. They collect your bucket, leaving you a fresh one on a weekly, bi-weekly or monthly basis. Scraps are then composted on a large scale and the results are sold to local farms or people in the community.</p><p>Each service has different rules about what you can add, but most let you throw all food and food-related items in the bucket (including meat, bones, dairy and fruit pits). You can also usually include coffee filters, pizza boxes, houseplants, BPI-certified compostable plastics and paper towels (without cleaning products on them). All services ask that you remove produce stickers and pull the staples from your teabags.</p><p>I have our pickup scheduled for every other Tuesday. Does two weeks\u2019 worth of food in a bucket stink? It does. To help with that, we keep our bucket outside with the lid firmly on.

I also keep old food in the fridge until right before collection day.</p><p>Of course, these services aren\u2019t available everywhere, and they cost $20 to $40 per month, so it\u2019s not a universal solution. I pay $22 for a twice monthly pickup and I look at the cost in terms of time: I would spend more than two hours a month maintaining a compost pile, so if I value my labor at $12 per hour, which is my state\u2019s minimum wage, the cost is worth it.</p><p>I like the little perks too, like getting a \u201cfree\u201d bag of compost twice per year and having a place to drop off our yearly batch of jack-o-lanterns once the faces start caving in. I also know that some of what I put in eventually goes to the <a href=\"https://lospoblanos.com/\">lavender farm</a> up the road from me. That\u2019s a much better end game for my avocado pit than being sealed up for eternity in a landfill.</p><h2>A sampling of composting services in the largest US markets</h2><p>Modern tech is making it easier for these services to pop up in more cities.

My driver told me they use the <a href=\"https://stopcheckr.com/management-suite/\">Stop Suite</a> app to optimize their pickup routes, send out text reminders and handle other customer service functions. Composting may be old as dirt, but the way we\u2019re creating it is brand new.</p><p>Of the 20 largest metro areas in the US, nine have or will have municipally-run compost collection programs.

These all use the new 50-megapixel 1/2.51-inch IMX858 sensor, which claims to offer the same noise reduction, all-pixel focus and DOL-HDR performance as its 1-inch cousin. If true, this would ensure a more consistent image quality across all four cameras, which had been a big challenge for smartphone makers previously. On the other side of the phone, the punch-hole selfie camera remains at 32 megapixels.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/40aa1ca0-dddb-11ed-8fdf-c0faeeb7965c\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>As with recent flagship phones, it comes as no surprise that the Xiaomi 13 Ultra is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor, with up to 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM and up to 1TB of UFS 4.0 storage. The device also supports USB 3.2 with up to 5Gbps of transfer speed \u2014 10x faster than the 12S Ultra \u2014 and up to 4K 60Hz of DisplayPort video output. The slightly larger 5,000mAh battery is complemented by a 90W charger, which reaches 100-percent charge in 35 minutes. You can also use it with Xiaomi's 50W wireless charger, when you're not in a rush. But if you do run out of juice, the new \"Hibernation mode\" can apparently stretch the final 1-percent battery into 60-minute standby or a 12-minute call, thanks to Xiaomi's very own P2 and G1 co-processors.</p><p>While the AMOLED display still comes in at 6.73 inches wide with the same 3,200 x 1,440 resolution, this time it's a new LTPO panel supplied by CSOT (a TCL subsidiary). This supposedly benefits from a new C7 luminous material with a more precise 12-bit color depth, along with a peak brightness of 2,600 nits (or up to 1,300 nits in high brightness mode), better viewing angles and lower power consumption. You get Dolby Vision support as well.</p><figure><img alt=\"Xiaomi 13 Ultra's \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/5ffb79d0-ddec-11ed-bfe7-61d77b5e468d\" style=\"height: 1000px; width: 1600px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Xiaomi</div></figure><p>As with its predecessor, the Xiaomi 13 Ultra features IP68 rating for dust- and water-resistance. In addition to its metallic unibody, the device also consists of a second-generation nano-tech material with anti-bacterial properties and UV resistance. Internally, it touts a new loop-shaped vapor cooling chamber, which uses multiple liquid channels to supposedly dissipate heat three times faster than a conventional design. This is mainly to keep the phone cool while shooting 4K videos.&nbsp;</p><p>The company also implemented a dual-wing cellular antenna module, which apparently offers a 58-percent boost in signal reception across all bands. As a bonus, the symmetrical antenna layout should reduce interference from hands, and there's also a new dedicated 5G antenna which apparently boosts the n78 band's signal by 100 percent.</p><figure><img alt=\"Xiaomi 13 Ultra professional photography kit\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/58bdd360-dde8-11ed-bede-7eca4f63ffb9\" style=\"height: 675px; width: 1080px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Xiaomi</div></figure><p>The Xiaomi 13 Ultra is already available for pre-order in China, starting from 5,999 yuan (around $870) for the 12GB RAM with 256GB storage model, all the way to 7,299 yuan (around $1,060) for the 16GB RAM with 1TB storage option.

I\u2019ve had dozens of notebooks over the years that served as repositories for to-do lists, story ideas, messages jotted down during meetings and everything in between. But at a certain point in my adult life, I turned away from physical notebooks because it became easier to save all of those things digitally in various apps that were always available to me on my phone. I sacrificed tactile satisfaction for digital convenience, and a small part of me mourns for all of the half-filled notebooks I left in my wake.</p><p>For some like me, an E ink tablet may be the solution to those dueling impulses. They can combine the feeling of writing in a regular notebook with many of the conveniences of digitized documents. E ink tablets allow you to take all of your notes with you on one device, while also letting you scribble with a stylus just like you would with pen-and-paper. Unlike regular tablets and styli, though, E ink tablets are nowhere near ubiquitous \u2014 but there are just enough players in the game to make deciding which one to buy more complicated than you might think. We tested out a bunch of the most popular E ink tablets available now to see how well they work, how convenient they really are and which are the best available today.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><h2>Are E ink tablets worth it?</h2><p>An E ink tablet will be a worthwhile purchase to a very select group of people. If you prefer the look and feel of an E ink display to LCD panels found on traditional tablets, it makes a lot of sense. They\u2019re also good options for those who want a more paper-like writing experience (although you can get that on a regular tablet with the right screen protector) or a more distraction-free device overall.</p><p>The final note is key here. Most E ink tablets don\u2019t have the same functionality as regular tablets, so you\u2019re automatically going to be limited in what you can do. And even with those that do allow you to download traditional apps like Chrome, Instagram and Facebook, E ink tablets are not designed to give you the best casual-browsing experience. This is mostly due to the nature of E ink displays, which have noticeable refreshes, a lack of color and lower quality than the panels you\u2019ll find on even the cheapest iPad.</p><p>Arguably the biggest reason why you <em>wouldn\u2019t</em> want to go with an iPad (all models of which support stylus input, a plethora of reading apps, etc) is because it\u2019s much easier to get distracted by email, social media and other Internet-related temptations. An e-reader is also worth considering if this is the case for you, but just know that most standard e-readers do not accept stylus input. If you like to make notes in the margins of books, underline and mark up PDFs and the like, an e-reader won\u2019t cut it.</p><h2>What to look for in an E ink tablet</h2><p>I discovered four main things that can really make or break your experience with an E ink tablet during my testing; first is the writing experience. How good it is will depend a lot on the display\u2019s refresh rate (does it refresh after every time you put pen to \u201cpaper,\u201d so to speak?) and the stylus\u2019 latency. Most had little to no latency, but there were some that were worse than others. Finally, you should double check before buying that your preferred E ink tablet comes with a stylus. Believe it or not, many of them require you to purchase the pen separately.</p><p>The second thing to consider is the reading experience. How much will you be reading books, documents and other things on this tablet? While you can find E ink tablets in all different sizes, most of them tend to be larger than your standard e-reader because it makes writing much easier. Having a larger display isn\u2019t a bad thing, but it might make holding it for long periods slightly more uncomfortable. (Most e-readers are roughly the size of a paperback book, giving you a similar feeling to analog reading).</p><p>The supported file types will also make a big difference. It\u2019s hard to make a blanket statement here because this varies so much among E Ink tablets. The TL;DR is that you\u2019ll have a much better reading experience if you go with one made by a company that already has a history in e-book sales (i.e. Amazon or Kobo). All of the titles you bought via the Kindle or Kobo store should automatically be available to you on your Kindle or Kobo E ink tablet. And with Kindle titles, specifically, since they are protected by DRM, it\u2019s not necessarily the best idea to try to <a href=\"https://www.ebook-converter.com/104-how-to-read-kindle-ebook-kobo.htm\">bring those titles over to a third-party device</a>. Unless the tablet supports reading apps like Amazon\u2019s Kindle or the Kobo app, you\u2019ll be limited to supported file types, like ePUB, PDF, MOBI, JPEG, PNG and others.</p><p>Third, most E ink tablets have some search features, but they can vary widely between models. You\u2019ll want to consider how important it is to you to be able to search through all your handwritten notes and markups. I noticed that Amazon\u2019s and Kobo\u2019s E ink tablets made it easy to refer back to notes made in books and files because they automatically save on which pages you took notes, made highlights and more. Searching is less standardized on E ink tablets that have different supported file types, but their features can be quite powerful in their own right. For example, a few devices I tested supported text search in handwritten notes along with handwriting recognition, the latter of which allows you to translate your scribbles into typed text.</p><p>The final factor to consider is sharing and connectivity. Yes, we established that E ink tablets can be great distraction-free devices, but most manufacturers understand that your notes and doodles aren\u2019t created in a vacuum. You\u2019ll likely want to access them elsewhere, and that requires some form of connectivity. All of the E ink tablets I tried were WiFi devices, and some supported cloud syncing, companion mobile apps and the ability to export notes via email so you can access them elsewhere. None of them, however, integrate directly with a digital note taking system like Evernote or OneNote, so these devices will always be somewhat supplementary if you use apps like that, too. Ultimately, you should think about what you will want to do with the documents you\u2019ll interact with on your E ink tablet <em>after</em> the tablet portion is done.</p><h2>Best for most: reMarkable 2</h2><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2\">latest reMarkable tablet</a> isn\u2019t topping our list because it\u2019s the most full-featured or even most interesting E ink tablet we tested. Rather, it provides the best mix of features people will find useful in a device like this. We\u2019ll get into them all, but first, it\u2019s worth mentioning build quality. The reMarkable 2 weighs less than one pound and is one of the sleekest E ink tablets we tried. It has a 10.3-inch monochrome digital paper display that\u2019s surrounded by beige-colored bezels, with the chunkiest portion at the bottom edge where you\u2019d naturally grip it. There\u2019s a slim silver bezel on the left side, which attaches to accessories like the folio case and the new <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/remarkable-2-type-folio-keyboard-hands-on-130057978.html\">Type Folio keyboard</a>. Hats off to reMarkable for making an E ink tablet that feels right at home with all of your other fancy gadgets.</p><p>Let\u2019s start with the writing and reading experiences on the reMarkable 2, both of which are great. From the get go, scribbling, doodling and writing was a breeze. We tested out the Marker Plus, which has a built-in eraser, but both it and the standard Marker are tilt- and pressure sensitive pens, and require no batteries or charging. I observed basically no lag between my pressing down onto the reMarkable 2\u2019s screen and lines showing up. The latency was so low that it felt the closest to actual pen-and-paper. But I will say that this is not unique among our top picks in this guide \u2013 almost all of the E ink tablets we tested got this very crucial feature right.</p><p>When it comes to reading, the reMarkable 2 supports PDFs and ePUBs, and you can add files to the device by logging into your reMarkable account on desktop or via the companion mobile app on your phone. You can also pair your Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive or Dropbox account with your reMarkable account and access files that way as well. That should be good enough for anyone who, say, reads a lot of academic papers or reviews many documents for work. It\u2019ll be harder for people who purchase their ebooks from online marketplaces like the Kindle or Kobo stores, but there are other options for those.</p><p>Another fun way to get documents onto the reMarkable 2 is via the <a href=\"https://support.remarkable.com/s/article/Read-on-reMarkable-Google-Chrome-Extension\">Read with reMarkable extension</a> for Google Chrome. After installing it and pairing your reMarkable account, you\u2019ll be able to send articles you find online directly to your reMarkable 2 so you can check them out later. You can even customize these files to be sent as text only, which will let you change their format directly on your reMarkable, or as a PDF. Regardless of which you choose, you\u2019ll be able to mark up these articles as you would any other file on the E ink tablet. I used this extension a lot and I did enjoy reading longform articles on the reMarkable 2 more than on my iPhone. Being able to underline, highlight and otherwise mark up those stories was more of a bonus than a necessity for me, but for others who glean sources from online materials will be better off for it.</p><p>Overall, it\u2019s pretty easy to get files onto the reMarkable 2 and it is possible to access them<br />elsewhere when you may not be able to whip out the E ink tablet. Those with a reMarkable Connect subscription will have the best experience, and it\u2019s a nice perk that you get a one-year membership when you buy one. The $3-per-month subscription provides the ability to edit existing notes and take new ones from anywhere using the desktop and mobile apps, plus unlimited cloud storage and syncing. On that last front, if you don\u2019t pay for Connect, only \u201cnotes and documents synced online in the last 50 days\u201d will be available in reMarkable\u2019s companion apps. I suspect 50 days worth of document syncing will be enough for some, but not power-users. Putting the ability to take notes anywhere behind a paywall is a bit of a bummer no matter what and makes it much harder for anyone to use the reMarkable ecosystem as their main note-taking space.</p><p>That said, I kept most of my testing to the reMarkable 2 itself and was impressed by its ability to be a digital notebook without a steep learning curve. You can create different notebooks and \u201cquick sheets\u201d to organize your handwritten notes, and folders to make sense of imported files. You\u2019ll find eight different brush types with which to mark up documents and take notes, along with various line thicknesses and \u201ccolors\u201d (which just show up as shades on the tablet itself). You can even type wherever you want in a doc, and the reMarkable 2 can translate handwritten notes into machine-readable text with surprising accuracy.</p><p>It was no shock that the reMarkable 2 ended up having the best mix of features, along with a relatively low learning curve. The company was one of the first on the scene with a truly viable E ink tablet back in 2017, and they\u2019ve been refining the experience ever since. But that comes at a cost \u2013 the reMarkable 2 isn\u2019t the most expensive E ink tablet we tested, but it\u2019s not cheap either.

The Scribe edged out the Elipsa 2E purely because of its low-latency pen-and-screen combination. The Elipsa has its merits, which we\u2019ll get into in a bit, but it just couldn\u2019t compete with the Scribe when it came to a seamless and smooth handwriting experience.</p><p>We already gave the Kindle Scribe the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazon-kindle-scribe-review-e-ink-reader-tablet-pen-drawing-price-battery-life-140019784.html\">full review treatment</a>, and in general, I enjoyed it while testing it out for this guide, too. As mentioned, there\u2019s little to no latency when writing on the Scribe with its companion pen. Thanks to the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/kindle-scribe-update-adds-new-brushes-and-better-organization-210011764.html\">latest software update</a>, you also have more brush types to choose from now, including fountain pen, marker and pencil, which add to the charm. Like other E ink tablets, the Scribe makes it easy to create multiple notebooks, and you can add pages to them and change up their templates if you wish.</p><p>As an e-reader, the Scribe shines not only thanks to its 10.2-inch display with auto-adjusting front lights, but also because you have Amazon\u2019s entire ebook store at your fingertips. If you get most of your reading material from Amazon or subscribe to <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9raW5kbGUtZGJzL2h6L3N1YnNjcmliZS9rdT9zaG9wcGluZ1BvcnRhbEVuYWJsZWQ9dHJ1ZSZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1zei0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTdmNDE0MTMtZWVjMi00ZDkwLTljMjUtMjZkMTQ0YjczN2I4In0&amp;signature=AQAAARj6eFOV3M9G1Z8l-1D34ToGloYCJ9BXtTXTUuTYEf76&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fkindle-dbs%2Fhz%2Fsubscribe%2Fku%3FshoppingPortalEnabled%3Dtrue\">Kindle Unlimited</a>, you\u2019ll be able to jump right into all of your titles instantly on the Scribe. It\u2019s also easy to get ebooks from your local library and read them on a Kindle. This will be crucial not only for voracious readers, but especially for students who buy or rent digital textbooks and those who consume books regularly for research purposes.</p><p>I thought about students a lot when using the Scribe. I started college in 2009, two years after the first Kindle was released and one year before the first iPad came out. Getting textbooks digitally really wasn\u2019t an option for me \u2013 but I can understand the appeal a device like the Kindle Scribe would have for students. It\u2019s arguably even better than a standard Kindle because its screen is bigger, which will make it less tiring to stare at for long periods of time. Adding the ability to take handwritten notes while you\u2019re studying is icing on the cake.</p><p>However, Amazon\u2019s execution of book notes is not my favorite. You actually cannot take notes in the margins of Kindle ebooks. Instead you press and hold the pen\u2019s tip on the screen to highlight text or add a note to a particular word or phrase. If you do the latter, a window pops up on the bottom half of the screen where you can either take a handwritten note or type a text note using the Scribe\u2019s mildly frustrating and sluggish on-screen keyboard.</p><p>This is where I give a nod to the <a href=\"https://us.kobobooks.com/collections/ereaders/products/kobo-elipsa-2e\">Kobo Elipsa 2E</a>, where you <em>can</em> write notes in the margins, underline, circle and otherwise mark up your reading material. It\u2019s a more natural (and fun) experience since it mimics what you\u2019d do if you were reading a physical book. It\u2019s a shame that the latency on the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/kobo-takes-on-the-kindle-scribe-with-improved-elipsa-2e-e-ink-tablet-040148388.html\">Elipsa</a> was just a hair more noticeable than that of the Scribe. If it weren\u2019t for that, it might have beaten Amazon\u2019s device here.</p><p>What that extra bit of latency translates to in practice is handwriting that can come out just a bit messier, and that increases precipitously the faster you write. But that also means that you\u2019ll notice this the most when taking notes longhand on the Elipsa; if you\u2019re primarily using an E ink tablet to mark up documents, it won\u2019t affect you as much. Despite that, I did like the way Kobo executed notebooks on the Elipsa. You can have a standard notebook where you can write and scribble away, or an \u201cadvanced\u201d notebook that supports handwriting-to-text conversion and inserting things like diagrams and formulas. Text conversion is actually pretty accurate, too, even when dealing with some of my ugliest handwriting.</p><p>Kobo also has a pretty sizable ebook marketplace, so it\u2019s certainly a decent option if you want to stay clear of the Amazon ecosystem. But Amazon has the upper hand when it comes to price. The Kobo Elipsa 2E pack that includes its stylus is $399, while the 16GB Kindle Scribe with the premium pen (which includes dedicated eraser and shortcut buttons) comes in at $369. Even if you max out the Scribe with 64GB of storage, you\u2019d only spend $20 more than you would on the Kobo Elipsa. That, combined with the Scribe\u2019s strong overall performance and the ubiquity of Amazon\u2019s ebook offerings will make it the better choice for most readers.</p><h2>Best as a notebook: Supernote X</h2><p></p><p>I spent a while testing all of these E ink tablets, and the <a href=\"https://supernote.com/collections/devices/products/supernote\">Supernote X</a> is the one I was consistently most excited to use. As a notebook nerd, I find this thing so cool. Available in 10.3-inch (what I tested) and 7.8-inch sizes, the Supernote X has a \u201cFeelWrite\u201d screen protector that has a different feel than a standard E ink screen. When writing on it with Heart of Metal Pen 2, which is weighty and looks like a fountain pen, you get a gel pen-like feel rather than the subtly scratchy vibe that other E ink tablets have. In fact, the Supernote X has one of the best writing experiences out of any tablet I tested.</p><p>The Supernote X supports a range of file types, including PDF, ePUB, Word (.doc), PNG and JPG, which really opens up the content you can put onto the thing. I wanted to see if I could treat it almost like a digital bullet journal, and that wasn\u2019t hard to do. There are built-in page templates, but I was able to download daily, weekly and monthly planner templates online, resize them and move them onto the Supernote X using <a href=\"https://www.android.com/filetransfer/\">Android File Transfer</a>. The device has a dedicated \u201cMyStyle\u201d folder where you can save files you want to use as templates. The most difficult part was making sure I had the dimensions right while resizing the documents. Once saved in the right folder, I could make an entire notebook out of the templates I had gotten from the internet for free.</p><p>Supernote does have its own \u201capp store,\u201d but there\u2019s not much in there, and its Play Store offerings are limited to only the Kindle app. This device doesn\u2019t have a backlight, so it won\u2019t be easy to see in dark environments. But you can download Amazon\u2019s ebook app and read just like you would on a standard tablet (no, you can\u2019t mark up books here either).</p><p>Honestly, the last thing I wanted to do with the Supernote X was read, though. The device really shines as an E ink notebook and the company clearly put a lot of thought into \u201cbuilding a better mousetrap,\u201d so to speak. You can translate handwritten words into typed text, but you don\u2019t have to do that in order for the software to recognize your handwriting. There\u2019s a keywords feature that lets you basically bookmark important phrases for quick access later. All you need to do is lasso the word, press the keyword button and the tablet\u2019s software will translate your writing into typed text. Then you can add it as a keyword and quickly jump back to it from the left-side tablet of contents menu. Similarly, you can bookmark titles and add stars to pages that are important, all of which help you jump between important bits.</p><p>That said, the Supernote X sometimes felt a little inconsistent. The writing experience was top-notch, but there were other things that felt a little less polished. For example, you can swipe down on the right bezel to bring up a menu that lets you quickly navigate between favorited notes and recent documents \u2013 that\u2019s quite thoughtful. But then the Files page just has a couple of starkly named folders like Export, Screenshot and Inbox that I didn\u2019t touch once, and the pen sidebar has more options than most people will know what to do with (and none of them have text labels).</p><p>These are small nit-picks, but they go to show that the Supernote X might not be the best device for tech novices. There is a learning curve here, but notebook nerds like myself will be thrilled with all that the Supernote X has to offer. Unsurprisingly, all those advanced features come at a steep price: the A5-sized tablet with a folio and pen will set you back at least $532, making it the most expensive set on our list.</p><h2>Honorable mention: Boox Note Air 2 Plus</h2><p></p><p>If you removed some of the notebook-specific features from the Supernote X and added in a more complete version of Android 11, you\u2019d get the <a href=\"https://shop.boox.com/products/noteair2\">Boox Note Air 2 Plus</a>. Boox makes a number of interesting E ink tablets and the Note Air 2 Plus is the one that best compares to the others on our list thanks to its 10.3-inch display. This is an Android tablet with an E ink screen, so that means you can actually download Android apps like Kindle, Kobo and others. There\u2019s even a web browser, and yes, you can watch videos on this thing, too.</p><p>Of course, just because you can do all of that doesn\u2019t mean you should. E ink screens are truly best for reading and writing, so I didn\u2019t spend much time binge watching YouTube on the Note Air 2 Plus \u2013 but I was happy that I had the freedom to do so. Really, the utility of Android comes in with the app store and I expect that most people will use it to download all of their favorite reading and writing apps. Much like a standard tablet, the Note Air 2 Plus will be a great option for anyone that gets their reading material from a bunch of different places \u2014 and since you can manually transfer documents from your computer to the device, too, it\u2019s far-and-away the most versatile option on our list.</p><p>I experienced little to no latency when writing on the Note Air 2 Plus and I was happy with the number of brush options it has. Like the Supernote X, it comes with a bunch of page templates you can use, or you can bring in your own PDFs and other documents to use as templates. There\u2019s an \u201cAI recognition\u201d feature that translates a whole page\u2019s handwriting into typed text, and it\u2019s actually pretty accurate. (Though, it did consistently confuse my \u201c&amp;\u201d for a capital A). I also appreciated that you can add other kinds of material to your notes, including web pages and voice recordings, and share notes as PDFs or PNGs via email, Google Drive and other services. Features like those ensure that, with this partially analog device, you don\u2019t miss out on some of the conveniences that a true digital notebook system would have.</p><p>Instead of going into all of the features the Note Air 2 Plus offers, I think it\u2019s most useful to talk about the value of this device. A bundle with the tablet, a standard pen and a folio case comes in at $500, putting it on the higher end of the price spectrum among the devices we tested. But considering it\u2019s a full Android tablet, that doesn\u2019t seem absurd. Those who want to avoid distractions most of the time while still having access to email and a web browser might gravitate towards a device like this. Also, most of Boox\u2019s devices operate in the same way, so you do have more affordable options if you like this blueprint. For example, the <a href=\"https://shop.boox.com/products/novaair2\">Boox Nova Air 2</a> is a 7.8-inch version of the Note Air 2 Plus, with slightly different RAM and storage specs to match, and its bundle comes in at $370.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-18 13:00:37+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Apple's previous-gen AirPods Pro drop to $159", "description": "<p>AirPods are known for two things: playing good audio and going on sale.

It will feature simplified combat comparable to <em>Pok\u00e9mon Go's</em> and will have players swiping and tapping on their phone screens. Players can fight battles one-handed in portrait mode, but they can also battle monsters in landscape mode if they want to replicate the <em>Monster Hunter </em>experience they're used to on PCs and consoles.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>While the franchise is known for challenging players with battles that could last for more than five minutes, though, the maximum battle time for the mobile game will only be 75 seconds. Sakae Osumi, a Niantic senior producer at its Tokyo studio where the game is being developed, said the company wants to encapsulate<em> Monster Hunter's</em> fun battles within a shorter window of time. Long, drawn-out battles aren't ideal for mobile games where you're supposed to walk around anyway. That said, <em>Monster Hunter Now</em> will come with a feature that will allow players to tag monsters they encounter with a paintball so that they could battle them at home, either on their own or with friends. Their Palico companions could automatically tag monsters, as well, even if the app isn't open.&nbsp;</p><p>Niantic is now <a href=\"https://monsterhunternow.com/\">accepting sign-ups</a> for the game's closed beta testing, which will begin on April 25th. If all goes well, and testing is a success, <em>Monster Hunter Now</em> will officially launch sometime in September this year.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/niantic-is-developing-an-augmented-reality-monster-hunter-action-rpg-091557321.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/niantic-is-developing-an-augmented-reality-monster-hunter-action-rpg-091557321.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-18 09:15:57+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Apple's Mac Mini M2 falls back to a low of $500", "description": "<p>Apple's Mac Mini M2 gives you more speed and connectivity than you'd guess in such a small package, and for surprisingly little money, too.

The lack of a rear window is an odd decision, as it's bound to make the interior feel a bit... stuffy. However, there is a standard full-length glass roof with optional electrochromic functionality that allows for opaque or transparent usage. To bring in a bit more light, it stretches down below the rear occupants' heads as well.&nbsp;</p><p>A high-definition screen up front displays the view from the rear camera. Polestar says it allows for &quot;a far wider field of view than what can be experienced in most other cars.&quot; Hopefully the company has a backup system of some kind, because if the screen or camera go down, drivers will have a massive blind spot behind them.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt=\"The Polestar 4 electric SUV arrives with 544 HP and no rear window\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/17956b70-ddb9-11ed-afbf-d1985b109e39\" style=\"height: 1985px; width: 3530px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Polestar</div></figure><p>The Polestar 4 is built on parent Geely's open-source Sustainable Experience Architecture.

The interior and materials drew inspiration from the fashion and sportswear industries, Polestar wrote.</p><p>For an SUV, it'll go fast. The 544 horsepower model will allow you to go from zero to 62MPH in 3.8 seconds, to start with. Polestar will also offer a 272HP, long-range single-motor version. The optional 102kWh battery has a targeted range of 560 km (348 miles) on the WLTP cycle, or around 300 miles in EPA terms. And charging should be quick, with up to 200kW fast charging that should allow about 800 miles of charge per hour.</p><figure><img alt=\"The Polestar 4 electric SUV arrives with 544 HP and no rear window\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/2bc19ab0-ddb9-11ed-bfe5-ce20118d2ffc\" style=\"height: 1125px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Polestar</div></figure><p>Like the Polestar 3, the 4's driver-assist (ADAS) system will run NVIDIA's Drive computing platform, using 12 cameras, one radar and 12 ultrasonic sensors.

This sends an electrical signal through the body to measure the resistance and reactions of body tissues to the currents. &quot;The more frequencies used, the more complete and accurate the picture of body health can be created,&quot; Withings says.</p><p>Along with the other advanced metrics, Withings claims that, for the first time, Body Smart will be able to measure your basal metabolic rate (BMR), which monitors how many calories one burns while resting. This can provide helpful information about your metabolic health and the scale will use it to determine your metabolic age, Withings says. The company will add these features in May.</p><p>Meanwhile, Withings has upgraded the mid-tier, $200 Body Comp scale with a color LCD screen.

Its new project, a collaboration with marine biologist Steve Simpson and marine ecologist Mary Shodipo, wants your help training AI to recognize aquatic wildlife sounds in hopes of replenishing them and raising awareness of the ocean\u2019s troubled habitats.</p><p>The Earth\u2019s coral reefs have been declining at a concerning pace thanks to climate change, overfishing and pollution. Higher water temperatures from our rapidly changing atmosphere can cause coral to release symbiotic algae that make the coral more prone to disease and death. Additionally, rising CO2 levels in the atmosphere can acidify the ocean, further <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-07-climate-change-could-bleach-most-coral-reefs.html\">damaging the reefs</a>.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The new Google Arts &amp; Culture experiment has a simple ask: Take a few minutes to discern between the high-pitched snaps, crackles and pops of feeding shrimp and the lower-pitched gurgles, groans and croaks of fish, and then use your newfound knowledge to contribute to an AI model that will help conservation efforts. You\u2019ll open a browser window, listen (preferably using headphones) to underwater recordings made with an underwater mic and tap an onscreen button when you believe you hear fish. If enough people contribute, the data should help automate the process.</p><p>\u201cCoral reefs are surprisingly noisy places, but where they are damaged or overfished, they become quieter due to the lack of marine life,\u201d said Simpson. \u201cIn some locations, our research involves placing sound recorders inside marine protected areas (where there is no fishing) and in nearby fished areas for comparison, to listen in on the benefits of protection. In other locations, we are comparing sites that have declined due to overfishing and poor water quality with those where we are actively restoring coral reefs by replanting corals and rebuilding habitats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are too many recordings for one person to sit down and listen to \u2014 and that\u2019s where you come in,\u201d explained Simpson. \u201cWe need your help, and the help of others like you, to form a listening collective. Your data will then be used to train computers to listen for fish sounds automatically.\u201d The team\u2019s recordings were made at 10 reefs from countries including Australia, Indonesia, the Philippines, the US, Panama and Sweden.</p><figure><img alt=\"Underwater view of a coral reef with a hydrophone (underwater microphone) protruding upwards.

In other words, playing back the sounds of healthy reefs could attract new fish and other underwater species to conserved reefs or those that have fallen on hard times thanks to the ravaging ecological effects of human industry.</p><p>Contributing only takes a few minutes. Although I wouldn\u2019t describe it as peak entertainment, it\u2019s at least as enjoyable as time-wasting browser games that don\u2019t contribute to real-world endeavors. The project\u2019s creators stress that even sitting down for one three-minute session will help their efforts. And the more time you spend (or tell others about the project), the more you pitch into a good cause.</p><p>Although I find it surprising they can\u2019t train the AI models on sound waves alone without the crowdsourcing part, inviting the general public to contribute should help raise awareness of a crucial \u2014 often ignored \u2014 aspect of the changing planet. As much as Google has transformed from its leaner early years, projects like this still remind me of the company\u2019s more idealistic roots from the \u201cDon\u2019t Be Evil\u201d era.</p><p>You can get started by watching the video below and visiting the <a href=\"http://goo.gle/callingcorals\">project website</a>.</p><div id=\"917ca0c853f2474f8c553b9b231ab499\"></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-wants-you-to-lend-your-ears-to-help-save-coral-reefs-000008834.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/google-wants-you-to-lend-your-ears-to-help-save-coral-reefs-000008834.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-18 00:00:08+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
