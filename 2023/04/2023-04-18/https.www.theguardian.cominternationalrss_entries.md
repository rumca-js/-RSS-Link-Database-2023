## Dubravka Ugrešić obituary

Writer in Serbo-Croatian whose mix of stringency and wit, although ignored in her own country, led to her being talked of as a possible Nobel laureate<p>The writer Dubravka Ugrešić, who has died aged 73, disliked borders, and came to think of herself as transnational or even postnational. While in her native Yugoslavia, as it then was, at the age of 22 she published her first work, a characteristically experimental and effervescent children’s book called Little Flame (1971). Fording the Stream of Consciousness (1988) dramatises an international literary conference in which characters from books and their authors turn up to confront scholars who are, in their view, horribly misrepresenting them. Light-footed yet learned, it displays Dubravka’s masterly literary range, expertise, and her love of parody and gift of ventriloquism. The witty, playful, absurdist fictions that followed as her life became more complex won esteem and many prizes.</p><p>In the trouble-free days before the former Yugoslavia was consumed in the civil wars of the 90s, she dwelt in opposing worlds, as a strikingly imaginative writer of fiction and an academic at the University of Zagreb, a city that before Yugoslavia’s formation in 1918 had been part of the Austro-Hungarian empire. She specialised in the Russian avant garde, reading and editing works by writers several of whom had been imprisoned or executed, their works censured and forgotten.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/18/dubravka-ugresic-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A record-breakingly diverse and multi-lingual set of acts helped give this year’s desert festival a more contemporary feel</p><p>Months from now, after the sense of fizzy overwhelm has lifted and the better-than-expected dust has settled, there will be two moments that recall for me the fire hose of Coachella, beyond the performances and surprises long since blasted across social media and dissected in Reddit threads. The first was a woman in a swimsuit and crocheted cover-up rousing a line of strangers on Friday afternoon with “who’s ready to see Bad Bunny?!” And the second was a snippet heard while dodging people either posing or on their phones in between the giant ferris wheel and trippy, holographic art installations – “how do you take <em>such</em> good pictures?”</p><p>Such was the non-music vibe of the music festival: questionably workable and confidently worn outfits, waiting in line, hype for the headliners, the warmth of desert sun and buzzed strangers. This was my first time at Coachella, but I’ve been on the internet long enough to know certain truths about the festival: it can be chaotic but is slickly run and ever expanding; the headliners could be once-in-a-lifetime or patchy but rarely forgettable. The weekend is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/apr/16/festival-fashion-is-back-as-coachella-marks-the-return-of-the-great-outdoor-music-party">as much about the photos and the fashion as the music</a>.

<p>This elegantly produced tour of the Rijksmuseum’s blockbuster exhibition allows you to enjoy leisurely closeups without having to fight through the crowds</p><p>The Exhibition on Screen series fully comes into its own with this guided tour of the <a href="https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/whats-on/exhibitions/vermeer">Vermeer show currently taking place at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam</a>; all the physical tickets for its four-month run are sold out, and so this film represents the only realistic chance for most people to take a turn around the gallery. While being in the presence of the real thing would clearly be a transcendent experience, there’s something to be said for this elegantly produced walking-tour in a needs-must situation.</p><p>The resulting film plays to the series’ strengths – glowing, leisurely closeups of the art, accompanied by a continual stream of learned comment from curators and critics. (In some ways, heretically, a film like this might actually be an improvement on the in-person experience: no fighting through crowds, or craning to see over a coach-party’s heads.) What we get is a brisk run-through of Vermeer’s back story, such as it is known; various Rijksmuseum eminences talk thematically through their exhibition, along with the likes of super-voluble former Times art critic Rachel Campbell-Johnston – though, perhaps forgivably, everybody mentions the actual show a bit too much to not remind the audience they’ll never actually get to see it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/18/vermeer-the-greatest-exhibition-review-best-seats-in-the-house-for-sold-out-show">Continue reading...</a>

<p>PSG edged closer to the Ligue 1 title with a 3-1 win over Lens, but there is still a disconnect between their players and fans</p><p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/rafajuc">Raphaël Jucobin</a> for <a href="http://www.getfootballnewsfrance.com/">Get French Football News</a></p><p>Lens goalkeeper Jean-Louis Leca and former captain Yannick Cahuzac introduced the dressing room to the victory chant that has become their trademark: “<em>On les a chicotés </em>(We’ve rattled them).”</p><p>The Corsican pair joined the club in the 2018-19 season, when they were still in Ligue 2. They led the team’s post-match celebrations during the pandemic-shortened campaign, when the club won promotion to the top flight. The chant caught on around the Stade Bollaert once fans were back in the stands and it is now sung in unison between players and fans after every home win – an increasingly regular occurrence as the team has climbed up the Ligue 1 standings.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/18/psg-win-points-title-lens-best-tunes-ligue-1-players-fans">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Chinese government used the pandemic to accumulate ever more power. The result was a totalitarian, anti-scientific humanitarian catastrophe</p><p>In one week last December, five members of Guan Yao’s family in Beijing died, including his father, his father-in-law and his grandmother. In an interview with a journalist, Guan, who lives in California, appeared powerless and dejected. Yet – for reasons that anyone from China understands – he chose his words carefully. Avoiding directly mentioning the Chinese government, he referred only to an ambiguous “them”. “It is difficult to understand,” Guan <a href="https://www.voachinese.com/a/6912850.html">said</a>, “why <em>they</em> abruptly lifted all restrictions.”</p><p>If you choose to believe official Chinese government documents, the deaths of Guan’s five relatives had nothing to do with Covid. They may have been infected with Covid, but government rules – rules that can’t be made public and can’t be questioned – required that doctors who issue death certificates come up with other causes of death. Guan’s uncle died of Parkinson’s, his grandmother of kidney failure.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/18/china-zero-covid-policy-xi-jinping">Continue reading...</a>
