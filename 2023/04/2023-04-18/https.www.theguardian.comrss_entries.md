Development economist who championed poor rural people, their approaches to agriculture and their health around the world<p>The development economist Michael Lipton, who has died aged 86, credited an important part of his education to the people of the village of Kavathe in Maharashtra state, India. His research there in 1965-66 anchored a lifetime devoted to understanding, explaining and advocating for poor rural people around the world.</p><p>Rather than being backward and conservative as some supposed, such communities acted rationally and managed resources efficiently. In his paper The Theory of the Optimising Peasant (1968), Michael explained that poor, small farmers were often reluctant to adopt new varieties of wheat and rice such as those rolled out in the green revolution of the mid-20th century, despite the average yield being higher than that of traditional varieties. This was because when the new varieties failed, because of drought or disease, they did so more spectacularly than traditional varieties, and thus increased the risk of hunger and destitution. When later generations of the green revolution crops reduced the risk, poor farmers adopted them with enthusiasm.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/apr/18/michael-lipton-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>More than 180 people have already died as two power-hungry men battle for control. But the desire for democracy endures</p><p>First they turned upon Omar al-Bashir, the strongman they had served, when the Sudanese people <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/11/omar-al-bashir-sudan-ousted-regime-president" title="">rose up against </a>the president. Then, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/25/sudan-coup-fears-amid-claims-military-have-arrested-senior-government-officials" title="">in a coup</a>, they turned upon the civilian politicians who had risen to power subsequently. Now they have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/18/first-edition-sudan" title="">turned upon each other</a>. Many feared that Sudan’s General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the de facto leader and army chief, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/17/mohamed-hamdan-dagalo-the-feared-ex-warlord-taking-on-sudan-army-hemedti" title="">Lt Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo</a>, the vice-president who controls the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces and is known as Hemedti, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/06/world/africa/sudan-generals-coup-civilian-rule.html" title="">would soon clash</a>.

The current conflict between them was triggered by plans to integrate <a href="https://theconversation.com/sudan-conflict-hemedti-the-warlord-who-built-a-paramilitary-force-more-powerful-than-the-state-203949" title="">Hemedti’s</a> RSF – fostered by Mr Bashir as a counterweight to the army – into the regular military, under controversial plans supposed to bring about <a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/africa/horn-africa/sudan/critical-window-bolster-sudans-next-government" title="">the country’s return to civilian rule</a> following 2021’s coup. The two men appear to regard their fight <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b9b9c797-1648-4595-a486-ad701e6c6876" title="">as a matter of survival</a>.

Allegedly in connection with £600,000 of donations that may or may not have been used for day-to-day party expenses.

She jolts as the cold paint hits her, hands smearing it on to her torso and down her back,finger-painting it over her face.</p><p>I thought the dancer was about to have her wet body pressed on to the canvas she was crouching on, just like one of Yves Klein’s living female stencils in his highly theatrical <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/yves-klein-1418/yves-klein-anthropometries">Anthropometries</a> live painting-performances made over 60 years ago. Instead, Florence Peake’s performer has a microphone shoved in her face and she begins reading the first of several hand-transcribed fragments of art historical commentary, going on about solipsistic pleasures and the abstract surface, grim parodies of sexual union and something about Cézanne’s 1877 painting <a href="https://www.getty.edu/art/collection/object/103RJ9">The Eternal Feminine</a>. It is all a jumble of windy wordage culled from the art books and catalogues whose open pages are strewn about on the floor nearby.

<p>The German artist caused uproar this week when he revealed the shot that won a prestigious award wasn’t what it seemed.

Sony have issued a statement, saying: “We no longer feel we are able to engage in a meaningful and constructive dialogue with him.” His <a href="https://www.eldagsen.com/">website</a> reads: “Sony: Stop saying nonsense!”</p><p>“I don’t know why they behaved like this,” he says, speaking to me from Berlin on the morning after the controversy broke. But I have a fair idea: plainly, they feel like they were conned, and had their aesthetic discernment called into question. If you can’t tell the difference between a photograph and an AI-generated image, then you may as well go home. But maybe both parties are being both too hard and too easy on themselves. Maybe, when done well enough, AI images can’t be distinguished from photography by anybody. And yet, as Eldagsen says, “I love photography, I love generating images with AI, but I’ve realised, they’re not the same. One is writing with light, one is writing with prompts. They are connected, the visual language was learned from photography, but now AI has a life of its own. If people want to be silent and not talk about that, that’s wrong.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/18/ai-threat-boris-eldagsen-fake-photo-duped-sony-judges-hits-back">Continue reading...</a>

Sign up now!</a></p><p>Football Daily has spent the last few days enjoying a right good laugh at the expense of Chelsea co-owner Todd D’oh!ly. Yes, he’s sitting on $5.3bn, which is about £500, and we’re wrestling with the big questions of 2023 (bread<em> or</em> spread?). But just look at the state of this philanthropic multi-billionaire! As Chelsea prepare for a season-defining Big Cup match against Real Madrid, most of the talk is not of the players, or Frank Lampard’s win percentage in his second spell as manager, or even his draw percentage. It’s D’oh!ly, whose dressing-room pep talk after the defeat by Brighton on Saturday <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/17/todd-boehly-tells-chelsea-season-embarrassing-dressing-room-brighton-real-madrid">has leaked faster</a> than b@nterous first-leg predictions from his overenthusiastic mouth. D’oh!ly reportedly called Chelsea’s season “embarrassing”, after which, according to the National Grid, there was a surge in pot/kettle analogies, and singled out one player – bought for big money in the last 12 months, and yes this stuff does write itself – for criticism. In the bowels of Stamford Bridge, it seems, there isn’t much looking glass. D’oh!ly’s combination of enthusiasm, power and ignorance are in danger of setting USA! USA!! USA!!!-UK football relations back 20 years, and they weren’t exactly thriving before he invited Jesse Marsch to hold his watery beer.</p><p>So, Todd Boehly chats to the players after every game. Perhaps he could spare a minute to chat to us Chelsea fans – we’d love to hear the thinking behind buying an unmanageably large squad, but no one to score a goal, and having more managers in a season than Roman Abramovich could have dreamed of” – Mike Davis.</p><p>After the weekend’s usual video-based officiating shenanigans, my son and I have decided to tentatively punt a better alternative. Rather than referring to a bunch of people in a shed, we humbly suggest referring to an ordinary football-watching person on a sofa with their Tin – arguably a better-versed authority – for a decision following several replays. It, of course would be known as BAR” – Peter Logan.</p><p><em><strong>This is an extract from our daily football email … Football Daily.

<p>Authenticity, not net worth, is the issue when a millionaire prime minister tries too hard to be normal</p><p>People don’t generally go into British politics for the money, although the money isn’t bad. The basic annual MPs’ salary of £84,144 is more than double the UK average. Ministers earn even more. But there are quicker ways to get rich.</p><p>There are careers where greed can go naked. In politics it has to skulk in itchy robes of public service. Bankers and hedge fund managers don’t need to explain what principle called them to global finance. When Rishi Sunak did those jobs, I doubt he was ever asked why. By the time he switched to politics, he had earned heaps of cash and married Akshata Murthy, the daughter of a billionaire. Cupidity was not the reason he sought office.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/18/sunak-wealth-problem-voters-authenticity-normal">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The jury’s still out on whether vapes are better for us than smoking. So why is the UK government handing them out?</p><p>I am vaping right now. It’s a watermelon one, which I bought from Sainsbury’s rather than from the vape shop that, unfortunately, is the nearest shop of any kind to where I live. The ones I normally buy are Triple Mango. “Oh, is one mango not enough?” people reliably joke when I tell them what flavour it is. No amount of mango could apparently be enough. If they brought out Quadruple Mango I’d be there banging my debit card on the counter. Earlier this week, the man who runs the vape shop took me through the new flavours he’d just got in, like I am a connoisseur of fine whisky. I’m not that. I am a silly little girl who likes her dummy.</p><p>I have had my brain well and truly fried over the past nine months or so by vapes. Not the old-style vapes: unflavoured, nerdy-looking objects that were for a long time the reserve of morose ex-smokers. The dumb fruity ones you’ve seen everywhere, littering the pavements, clutched in the mitts of pub-goers and people waiting for the bus, called things like Blappleberry Blast or Dr Maniac’s Pinacoloco.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/18/vaping-addiction-impossible-to-quit-uk-government">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Our sex life has waned since having a child, but now when my wife initiates intercourse it is always after alcohol. Should I give up trying?</p><p><strong>My wife and I are </strong><strong>in our </strong><strong>40s and have a teenage son. Before we had our son we </strong><strong>had a very active sex life and each of us would initiate almost daily: we would </strong><strong>share fantasies all the time. After childbirth it waned, understandably,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>but in recent years it has dwindled to </strong><strong>almost nothing. We both work from home and she often asks me to massage her body at night, but this virtually never leads to sex.</strong><strong> I find it hard to initiate </strong><strong>now, as when I do</strong><strong> she rejects me. She has initiated </strong><strong>a few times in the last six months, always after alcohol. When we have sex it is still good, but it feels </strong><strong>as if she only wants it after drinking. When I have raised this she has been defensive and suggested</strong><strong> we have a normal sex life for our age</strong><strong>. Should I</strong><strong> give up on the idea of </strong><strong>regular sex and accept that satisfying myself</strong><strong> in the bathroom is</strong><strong> now the norm?</strong></p><p>Paradoxically, being very close to someone can lower the erotic charge. Many couples who spend all day and all night together experience lowered sexual interest. Find ways to spend time apart, perhaps pursuing separate interests such as a class or sport or hobby. Enjoying solo time with friends can also help. Experiencing oneself as an extension of another person can feel safe and cosy, but it is unlikely to inspire passion in either of you. It is only when each partner can view the other as a separate entity – as things were at the beginning of the relationship – that attraction and libido can be revived. And don’t worry about the alcohol use – unless it’s excessive. There’s no need to take it personally – your wife is just trying to relax and get herself “in the mood”.</p><p>Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</p><p>If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to <a href="mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com">private.lives@theguardian.com</a> (please don’t send attachments).

The Chelsea Football Club director Eugene Tenenbaum was celebrating his 50th birthday, in “disco attire”. On the flyer emailed to guests, an old photo showed a small boy standing barefoot, in front of what appears to be a pile of hay. The caption underneath read: “You’ve come a long way baby!”</p><p>Tenenbaum had plenty to celebrate – as a close associate of Roman Abramovich, he helped manage an empire that ranged from the oilfields of Siberia to the Premier League in England – and he wanted to thank those who had helped along that journey.

## Beyond basic vinaigrette: alternative salad dressings | Kitchen aide

<p>There are nearly as many types of dressing as there are salads, and our panel of cooks say you just have to be willing to experiment  </p><p><strong>I always make a classic vinaigrette, but what other dressings should I have in my arsenal? <br /></strong><em><strong>Sarah, York</strong></em><br />This sounds like a job for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/emilyreesnunn/?hl=en">Emily Nunn</a>, the American food writer behind cult newsletter <a href="https://emilyrnunn.substack.com/">The Department of Salad</a>: “I’m going to sound as if I work for the International Salad Federation,” she says, “but the advice I would give Sarah is not to fence herself in. There are a million different kinds of salads, and just as many vinaigrette out there.” That’s to say, don’t dismiss vinaigrette out of hand just because you’ve mastered the classic. “A light lemon vinaigrette is perfect for spring, but if you want something stronger, chop up shallots, add them to the jar, shake and leave to sit in the fridge overnight.” The simplest adjustments will keep things interesting – Nunn’s suggestions include anchovies, capers, sherry vinegar.</p><p>“I would then get Sarah thinking about green goddess dressing,” adds Nunn, who first makes it as a dip (for sugar snap peas, say) by blending tarragon, mint, chives, parsley, red onion, garlic, lemon juice and anchovy, then mayo, soured cream and maybe salt. To turn that into a salad dressing, she loosens the mix with buttermilk, a little more mayo and extra seasoning and/or lemon juice if needed.</p><p>Got a culinary dilemma?

<p>The Liebfraumilch years are long gone. From seriously good riesling to juicy pinot noir, Germany now has plenty to offer</p><p>I’m not quite sure when it happened. There was no moment of Damascene conversion, no single palate-altering bottle or preconception-shredding cellar tour but some time over the past couple of years, the weight of evidence (measured in the strictly scientific unit of empty bottles per week) began to point to an unexpected conclusion: the single most improved, exciting, and all-round high-performing wine country in the world right now might be Germany.</p><p>For drinkers of my generation (X) and older this is quite the volte face. We came to wine-drinking during Germany’s nadir as a quality producer – the second half of the 20th century when a kind of crazed, number-chasing ethos took over the country’s increasingly chemical-soaked vineyards. These were devoted to monstrous yields from lesser grape varieties grown in unsuitable places, the emblematic product being the bafflingly successful sugary acid-water sold as Liebfraumilch.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/apr/18/whats-the-most-exciting-country-for-wine-in-the-world-right-now-germany">Continue reading...</a>

## Succession isn't bad - but it is overrated | Arwa Mahdawi

<p>From the profanity to the shaky cinematography, I have finally had my fill of the hit drama. I’ll say this for the makers though, they do know when to stop</p><p>Every now and then I generously offer my opinion on why everyone’s favourite <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/14/i-dont-watch-game-of-thrones-which-makes-me-a-lot-more-interesting-than-you">TV show</a> or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/13/why-even-lesbianism-and-bunnies-couldnt-make-me-love-the-favourite">movie</a> is actually pretty stupid and it doesn’t tend to go down very well. My thoughts on Game of Thrones caused an absolute bloodbath in my online mentions. This time I’m prepared for the backlash: I’ve locked my Twitter account and started planning my “I’ve been cruelly silenced by the masses” speaking tour. Do your worst, everyone, I’m ready to be cancelled!</p><p>Here we go then: I’m sorry to say this, but Succession, the award-winning HBO show, is overrated. Season one, I’ll gladly admit, was incredible. Season two was just as good. But after that, it started getting meh. It is the same old story over and over again: rich people backstabbing rich people and swearing a lot as they wallow in opulent misery. I’m a big fan of swearing, but it gets a bit much when every other word is an expletive. There were apparently 2,071 “fucks” in the first three series of Succession and no episode had fewer than 40 uses. The <a href="https://www.theringer.com/succession/2023/3/24/23653923/succession-f-word-stats-by-the-numbers">finale of season three </a>had 119.

It’s as if the writers have mistaken profanity for profundity.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/18/succession-is-overrated">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘We got bored waiting for Oasis to re-form’: AIsis, the band fronted by an AI Liam Gallagher

<p>A new album – full of Oasis-esque anthems – imagines what might have been if the band’s classic lineup had continued making music. So, we ask its human co-creators, what’s the story?</p><p>Before you do anything else with your day, you need to listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whB21dr2Hlc">this</a>. A new “lost” Oasis album has been released, from the period between their third album, 1997’s Be Here Now, and their fourth, 2000’s Standing on the Shoulder of Giants. Except, of course, it’s fake. It was created by AI – or at least, it’s an AI Liam Gallagher doing its best “hellooooos” and “sun-shiiiines” over a real band. But the eight songs, including Out of My Mind, Coming of Age and Forever, are practically indistinguishable from the real thing, with some seriously catchy melodies that give every post-What’s the Story album – not to mention the whole of Liam <em>and</em> Noel’s solo catalogues – a run for their money. So who made it? How do you get a computer to sing like Liam? And why would you want to?</p><p>“We just got bored waiting for Oasis to re-form,” says Bobby Geraghty, a 32-year-old singer, songwriter and producer. “All we have now is Liam and his brother trying to outdo each other. But that isn’t Oasis. So we got an AI-modelled Liam to step in on some tunes that were originally written for a short-lived but much-loved band called Breezer.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/18/oasis-aisis-band-fronted-by-an-ai-liam-gallagher">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Nothing says ‘monumental’ like commemorative mugs, a tarragon quiche and 4,000 articles about two California residents</p><p>In the week before Harry and Meghan’s wedding I watched a woman in the Kensington Palace shop buy a mug that featured the entwined initials of the couple and retailed at £39. “I love how down to earth they are,” she said. I wonder where that mug is now (the cup, not the woman). There will always be new mugs, of course, and the Royal Collection is currently <a href="https://www.royalcollectionshop.co.uk/chinaware/collection/the-coronation-of-king-charles-iii.html">selling a coronation tankard</a> for £50, as well as such essentials as a £40 bone-china coronation pillbox finished in 22-carat gold, possibly in keeping with King Charles’s oft-stated mission to modernise the monarchy. If you are one of the lucky Brits selected by lottery to receive a GP appointment before the big day, do consider purchasing it and popping your medication in it.</p><p>In the meantime you have to ask: how confidence-inspiring, really, is any event that has thus far been defined by about 4,000 articles (and counting) about the attendance or non-attendance of a couple of guests? Nothing says “we’re bigger than that and have moved on” like obsessing over the social plans of two California residents. This event is so inspiring and generational and monumental that the sole thing people can get truly worked up about is how their worst person in the world isn’t coming to it. Surely the one interesting thing about King Charles isn’t his fractured relationship with his younger son? And yet, the tale of the column inches seems to suggest it might be. For a couple we keep hearing are no longer important, the Sussexes do still seem to be the only subject in town.</p><p>Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/18/britain-coronation-sussexes-mugs-quiche-articles-california">Continue reading...</a>

If the mystery is a doozy, a personality-free investigator isn’t always a dealbreaker. If you’re enjoying spending time with the sleuths, whodunnit doesn’t necessarily matter. Will Trent, a breezy escape of a cop show, is in the second category.</p><p>We’re in Atlanta, Georgia, where sunshine streams dustily through windows, old soul music is always playing somewhere within your earshot and people talk to each other with a terse, fuss-averse wit. While the regular Atlanta police department do their best to solve major crimes, their vibe is constantly ruined by the fancy know-it-alls from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, swanning in to hoover up all the good cases.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/18/will-trent-review-disney-plus-karin-slaughter">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Shattered, out in 2024, will expand on the material the Buddha of Suburbia author has been sharing on social media from his hospital bed since a fall in Rome last year</p><p>The novelist and screenwriter Hanif Kureishi will publish a memoir in 2024 about the accident that left him paralysed last year. Shattered will expand on the material The Buddha of Suburbia’s author has been sharing on social media and Substack, which he continues to dictate from an Italian hospital.</p><p>On Boxing Day 2022, the author was rushed to intensive care after a fall in Rome. He later tweeted (via dictation to family) that he may <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/06/hanif-kureishi-fall-rome-spinal-surgery-novelist-screenwriter">never be able to walk or use a pen again</a>. Since then his blogposts <a href="https://hanifkureishi.substack.com/">The Kureishi Chronicles</a>, published via Substack, and his tweets have shared insights on everything from his health to his recreational drug use. A recent post told of a visit from Kureishi’s schoolfriend David, whom the author revealed he had fancied in his youth. David had pushed the writer around the hospital’s small garden and the pair had enjoyed discussing “anything that came into [their] minds”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/18/hanif-kureishi-to-publish-memoir-about-accident-that-left-him-paralysed-shattered">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Historic English clubs cling on to their heritage as many worry that the RFU does not care about preserving them at all</p><p>Plenty of arguments are raging in rugby union and the next big battle is for the soul of the English game. There is recognition on all sides that something has to change. As Bristol’s director of rugby, Pat Lam, said last week, it has become a source of global curiosity. “Everyone around the world knows England have the most rugby players and the most resources,” he said. “They’re envious. So how are we struggling? You have to ask the question.”</p><p>What suits Lam and his club’s wealthy owner, Steve Lansdown, however, does not necessarily suit a Premiership rival like Newcastle, whose playing budget for next season is understood to have shrunk appreciably. Where in all this are the most fundamental of questions? What is best for the health of the whole game, not just the high-profile apex of the pyramid? And what, exactly, is ultimately the aim of the entire exercise?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/apr/18/rugby-union-structure-leaves-championship-future-up-in-air-the-breakdown">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Author Curtis Sittenfeld on falling hopelessly in love with a brave, beautiful and occasionally malodorous chihuahua named Weenie</p><p>It’s hard to pick my favorite thing about my family’s pandemic rescue chihuahua, Weenie, but if I had to, I think it’s when she’s been napping under a blanket, as in when she’s covered by the blanket completely, and a human she loves approaches and she can hear or smell us and her tail visibly wags beneath the blanket’s fleece. Or perhaps it’s her enthusiasm for car rides, and how when she notices that we’ve put on our shoes and are approaching the back door, she becomes frantic to go along, barking and running in circles, and then in the hall by the garage, in the middle of her franticness, she makes eye contact with us and flips onto her back for an impromptu belly rub because, really, is it ever a bad time? Or maybe it’s when I’m sitting on the couch reading and she jumps up and wedges herself as close as she can beside me and sets her perfect little whiskered chin on my thigh, as if my thigh was designed to be a chihuahua chin platform, which, although I didn’t know it for most of my life, maybe it was.</p><p>Is this the moment to reveal that I’m not really a dog person? But it turns out I’m a Weenie person. (About her name: have you read the 1950s Eloise book about the spoiled yet neglected little girl who lives in the Plaza Hotel in New York and has a pet dog named Weenie and a pet turtle named Skipperdee? Weenie is named after Eloise’s dog. Yes, the name has raised a few eyebrows, but no more than being a woman named Curtis has for me.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/apr/18/pandemic-puppy-pet-animal-rescue">Continue reading...</a>

## Hilma af Klint and Piet Mondrian review – Swedish mystic is no match for the great modernist

<p><strong>Tate Modern, London<br /></strong>Connecting the two through their shared religious interests misunderstands the Dutch artist – and does Af Klint no favours</p><p>Abstract art does not just mean painting freely and wildly, putting it out there with abandon. If it did, any old doodle or curtain fabric would be abstract art. But modernist abstract painting in the 20th century found meaning in the colours, logic in the lines, discipline in freedom. The greatest abstract paintings convince you they are inevitable, because they have such inner coherence. The paragon of this art is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/piet-mondrian">Piet Mondrian</a>. A model of his apartment in New York, where he spent the last few years of his life, in Tate Modern’s show is a glimpse into a world of intercrossed grids and pulses of colour, floating in space with musical harmony and tranquil conviction: a utopian vision just under the surface of every day life.</p><p>To reach this vision, Mondrian had to go through a series of inner and outer changes, stimulated by encounters with the revolutionary art movements of his time. Yet his closest allies, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2017/mar/01/de-stijl-turns-100">De Stijl movement</a>, who shared his love of primary colours and black lines, don’t get a look-in here. Instead, Mondrian’s art is hammered into his mystical religious interests, because this is all he shared with the Swedish medium and artist Hilma af Klint. She gets equal billing with Mondrian for her paintings that illustrate the ideas of the spiritualist movement and her own transcendental experiences. She would look better in another context – she <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/oct/06/hilma-af-klint-abstract-art-beyond-the-visible-film-documentary">has been rediscovered</a> partly because she resembles 21st-century artists – but putting her next to one of the very greatest modernists does her no favours.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/18/hilma-af-klint-and-piet-mondrian-review-tate-modern-london">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Her military painting was such a sensation that it was bought by Queen Victoria.

## ‘It made me wish I had made more records’: Natalie Merchant on returning to music after losing her voice

<p>Emergency surgery on her spine led to months of enforced silence for the former 10,000 Maniacs singer-songwriter. But rather than take it easy, she’s been raising her teenage daughter, campaigning against fracking and has a new album out</p><p>It was late 2018 and Natalie Merchant was in London visiting the V&amp;A museum when she felt her arm start to tingle and then go numb. Next came intense pain. She flew home immediately and within days was in hospital having an MRI. The results were not good: she had a degenerative spinal disease. “My spinal column was collapsing into my spinal cord,” Merchant says. “I needed to have emergency surgery.” The six-hour operation involved making an incision below her throat and shunting her vocal cords to the side while surgeons removed three bones from her spine. When she regained consciousness after surgery Merchant discovered she could no longer sing. “It took me to a place of panic,” she says. “It made me wish I had made more records.”</p><p>Merchant had been a much-cherished singer-songwriter for more than four decades: she joined the alternative rock band 10,000 Maniacs at the age of 16 in 1981; 12 year later, she left to pursue a solo career. Now, an enforced silence stretched from weeks into months, and Merchant started imagining a post-music career sewing, creating artworks and gardening.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/18/natalie-merchant-on-returning-to-music-after-losing-her-voice-10000-maniacs">Continue reading...</a>

## The Locksmith review – Ryan Philippe holds the key to straight-ahead noir thriller

<p>Philippe’s newly released con faces heavy pressure not to go straight as his family grows ever more estranged and the film runs low on fresh ideas</p><p>The plot manoeuvres in this léger noir are so boilerplate and predictable that viewers are likely to find themselves expecting much bigger twists than are actually delivered. Surely that nice guy will turn out to be a double-crosser, you assume? Or you might imagine one of the vampy women will turn out to be a triple-crossing femme fatale. But no, it’s all pretty much on the level, which makes the snippets of classic Hollywood crime thrillers such as Touch of Evil, just glimpsed on a TV set, feel seriously undermining, gesturing as they do towards much more sophisticated works of cinema than we have here.</p><p>Ryan Phillippe stars as Miller, the titular locksmith, who in the opening scene has been forced into doing a heist that goes very wrong and ends up sending him to prison for 10 years. When he gets out, his now-ex-wife Beth (Kate Bosworth) is a rising police officer and his daughter Lindsay (Madeleine Guilbot) barely knows him. At least old friend Frank (Ving Rhames) offers him a job, but it’s only a matter of time before the past comes round again with Miller under pressure to atone for past crimes by committing entirely new ones. Gabriela Quezada is on hand as a battered sex worker, the surviving sister of a man whom Miller got killed years back. There are good cops and dirty cops, and shootouts at motels that puncture the eerie quiet of what looks like a barely populated desert town.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/18/the-locksmith-review-ryan-philippe-holds-the-key-to-straight-ahead-noir-thriller">Continue reading...</a>

## Good Girls: A Story and Study of Anorexia by Hadley Freeman – review

<p>This searing memoir from a recovered anorexic, which explores the warped thinking around the illness, should be required reading</p><p>There is a sense in which Hadley Freeman’s <em>Good Girls</em> has been written by two authors: the anorexic teenager she once was and the recovered 44-year-old journalist with three children she now is (she was, until recently, a staff writer on the <em>Guardian</em> and, for almost a decade, its fashion correspondent). Anorexics tend to be unreliable witnesses when in the grip of the illness and, at times, there is an oddity about this book, a curious sense of separation between the suffering younger self and the aloof older self, but Freeman is a brave, illuminating and meticulous reporter and uses her experience wisely. According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists, <a href="https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/news-and-features/latest-news/detail/2022/05/18/hospital-admissions-for-eating-disorders-increased-by-84-in-the-last-five-years">hospital admissions for eating disorders have increased by 84%</a> over the past five years, a fact that in itself should make this revelatory book required reading.</p><p>Freeman explores the anorexic’s warped thinking and brings us as close as is possible to understanding the incomprehensible – the consuming obsession with not consuming. It was a casual comment that ignited her illness. It often is, apparently. A skinny girl said to her: “I wish I was normal like you.” “Normal” triggered what would become her abnormal struggle (a “trigger”, she points out, is not the same as a “cause”). She grew up in a Jewish-American family – loving, comfortably off – and came to England from New York, aged 11. At home, she believes she absorbed the subtext that “food was the medium through which women express unhappiness”. She debunks the oversimplification that anorexia is caused by the fashion industry’s insistence on skeletal models, but emphasises that “the association between female self-denial and perfect femininity is entrenched in our culture. This doesn’t cause anorexia, but it gives it a fertile ground in which to breed.” She investigates new theories about the illness, including its possible connections with autism, OCD and metabolic rate. The book is garnished with expert opinion from doctors, psychiatrists and co-anorexics encountered in hospital, with whom she has been back in touch. Her tendency is to challenge reflex opinion and never to make the mistake of claiming to know more than is known. For whatever you thought you knew, the truth about anorexia is always more complicated. One of her most unnerving assertions is that anorexia is “not a desire to be thin – it is a desire to look ill”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/18/good-girls-a-story-and-study-of-anorexia-by-hadley-freeman-review">Continue reading...</a>

## Pity the coronation chefs – theirs is a thankless and debasing task

<p>Creating a commemorative recipe is tricky. Coronation chicken is delicious, but its specific mix of ingredients and colonialism wouldn’t be appropriate in 2023</p><p>I thought the most thankless and debasing task in the country, where royal events were concerned, was poet laureate. You have to be medium thoughtful to be a reputable poet – sensitive, at least occasionally profound, interested in the big stuff – and then someone makes you write a poem about a baby. It’s like the world’s worst copywriting gig: trying to distinguish your product, this baby, from all other products, different babies, which are just as good. Investitures and coronations, even worse: they are already metaphors, and then some poor schmuck has to spin a load of meta-metaphors about them.</p><p>That was before Prue Leith, Tom Kerridge and Rick Stein unveiled their coronation recipes. The pressure’s not the same, because these weren’t solicited by the palace, but by a newspaper, and obviously (no offence) in a rush. There is nothing inherently wrong with any of the dishes, which all look fine – a kedgeree from Stein, a carrot hummus from Leith, a cheesecake from Kerridge – if a little underwhelming.</p><p>Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/18/pity-the-coronation-chefs-theirs-is-a-thankless-and-debasing-task">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A village treasure hunt digs up trouble, a game of dares goes too far and a Mary Higgins Clark classic is revisited in this month’s highlights</p><p>Anna Bradshaw remembers nothing when she wakes in a London hospital after an accident. Her husband, Stephen, feels like a total stranger to her; the details of her life are a mystery. “It is as though there is an impenetrable black box in my head, like the flight recorder of a crashed plane, but it is locked and tightly sealed and there is no way for me to access it.” Meanwhile, in Bristol, Livvy Nicholson has a six-month-old son, a loving new husband, Dominic, and a yearning to get back to work that is being inadvertently thwarted by Dominic’s plans for his own career. There are shades of <em>Before I Go to Sleep</em>, SJ Watson’s debut novel about a woman with amnesia, in Hannah Beckerman’s <strong><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-forgetting-9781542030380">The Forgetting</a></strong><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-forgetting-9781542030380"> </a>(Lake Union), but that’s no bad thing: Beckerman gives the amnesia trope her own twist to create a compelling, claustrophobic story. In the best possible way, this is a hugely stressful read, as we watch both women slowly come to realise the truth about their situations, urging them on from the sidelines. I finished it in one huge gulp, excusing myself unilaterally from any family responsibilities I was so desperate to finish it.</p><p><strong><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/death-under-a-little-sky-9780008517014">Death Under a Little Sky</a></strong> (HarperCollins) is journalist Stig Abell’s first novel and a joyful dive into the detective genre. Jake Jackson is a washed-upcop, disillusioned with his career and his marriage. So when his uncle dies, leaving him a property in the middle of nowhere, he gives it all up to begin a new life off-grid: long runs, morning swims in his private lake, minimal interaction with the world at large and time to read through his uncle’s vast library of detective novels. He is sucked back in, though, both by beautiful neighbour Livia Bennet and by the discovery, during a treasure hunt around the nearby village of Caelum Parvum, or Little Sky, of a young woman’s bones. What really happened to her and who can Jake really trust out here? Abell’s enjoyment of the genre shines through, as Jake ponders what the likes of Jack Reacher might do in a messy situation, and as he and Livia team up to investigate, becoming “Jackson and Bennet, the crime-fighters of Little Sky”, another of crime fiction’s detective duos. I was charmed and engrossed – by Jake’s self-reinvention, by Abell’s eccentric cast of characters (“It’s the middle of the day in a picturesque English church.

<p>Some organisms truck along slowly for aeons before suddenly surging into dominance – and something similar often happens with human inventions, too. But why?</p><p>What are the most successful organisms on the planet? Some people might think of apex predators like lions and great white sharks. For others, insects or bacteria might come to mind. But few would mention a family of plants that we see around us every day: grasses.</p><p>Grasses meet at least two criteria for spectacular success. The first is abundance. Grasses cover the North American prairies, the African savannahs and the Eurasian steppes, which span 5,000 miles from the Caucasus to the Pacific Ocean. A second criterion is the number and diversity of species. Since the time grasses originated, they have evolved into more than 10,000 species with an astonishing variety of forms, from centimetre-high tufts of hair grass adapted to the freezing cold of Antarctica to the towering grasses of northern India that can hide entire elephant herds, and to Asian bamboo forests, with “trees” that grow up to 30 metres tall.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/apr/18/evolution-biology-sleeping-beauties-innovations-that-wait-millions-of-years-to-come-good">Continue reading...</a>

Admittedly, there were a few issues. The steam didn’t help, plus I wrapped it in too much tinfoil, so the heat couldn’t penetrate. The main problem, though, was that holding an iron meant I automatically started ironing the package, pressing hard and going to and fro industriously. The result is flat, very flat. “We have a sandwich toaster,” my husband points out, holding the crepe-thin delicacy between finger and thumb. He should be thrilled: this is the closest I’ve come to cooking for him in months. He tries it, reluctantly. “It’s very soft.
