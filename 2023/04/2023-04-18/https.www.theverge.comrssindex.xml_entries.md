  <p id="BQ0JYL">Reddit announced <a href="https://www.redditinc.com/blog/2023apiupdates">new API changes today</a> that will eventually pinch its content pipeline from being used to train artificial intelligence tools, including the models that power OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Bard, and Microsoft’s Bing AI. AI chatbots’ abilities to provide powerful answers have data resources like Reddit to thank — and now Reddit is planning to put that robot food behind a paywall. </p>
<p id="O6icv0">Social media resources, including Reddit, are some of the sources used to train large language models (LLM) that can provide cogent responses to human prompts. Some of this data can be scraped in an unstructured manner, but Reddit’s API has helped companies make it easy to directly find and package useful data.</p>

  <p id="aD4O6o">Apple’s long-rumored VR / AR headset might run adapted versions of iPad apps, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-18/apple-vr-ar-headset-apps-sports-tv-fitness-gaming-wellness-ipad-features?leadSource=uverify%20wall">a new report from <em>Bloomberg</em></a><em>. </em>The mixed reality device’s new interface will also apparently let users access “millions” of already-available apps on the App Store.</p>
<p id="dFZaZH">This, in my opinion, is very good news: a bunch of great apps could go a long way in making a compelling case for what’s expected to be a very expensive gadget in a device category that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/5/23671673/apple-vr-ar-mixed-reality-headset-worst-possible-time">isn’t doing great right now</a>. </p>
<p id="jQB16k">Here are some of the apps you can expect, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>:</p>

  <p id="0TeIvf">Starting today, Apple HomePod smart speakers can alert you if a smoke or CO detector goes off in your home. The Sound Recognition feature, first announced when the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23578606/apple-homepod-2-second-gen-2023-siri-smart-speaker-review">second-gen HomePod</a> was launched earlier this year, listens for the alarm sound and sends a notification to your phone. Apple says the capability is now rolling out on the second-gen HomePod and HomePod Mini, though we haven’t yet seen it in our apps.</p>
<p id="cB9UM6">For this to work, you’d need to have smoke and CO alarms installed in your home; the speakers cannot detect actual smoke or carbon monoxide. But they don’t need to be smart smoke alarms or have any internet connection, which is good news. Currently, the only smart smoke alarms compatible with Apple Home in the US are <a href="https://www.firstalertstore.com/store/products/onelink-generation-3-smart-smoke-and-co-alarm-hardwired-1042135.htm">First Alert’s...</a></p>

  <p id="dIWdMQ">General Motors recently made a decision that, depending on how you look at it, may come back to bite them in the ass. </p>
<p id="cAfGd2">The company announced that for its future lineup of electric vehicles, it would no longer offer access to Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. That means future owners of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/19/23269768/chevrolet-blazer-ev-announcement-launch-ss-1lt-crossover-price">Chevy Blazer EV</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/20/23412119/gmc-sierra-ev-denali-electric-truck-specs-price-range">GMC Sierra EV Denali</a> won’t be able to project their phone’s operating systems onto the infotainment screen of their vehicles. </p>
<p id="dJYDFR">The backlash was swift. Car shoppers <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2023/04/14/gm-apple-carplay-android-auto-ford/70100598007/">told the <em>Detroit Free Press</em></a> that the move was “a dealbreaker” and a “huge blunder.” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/4/23669523/gm-apple-carplay-android-auto-ev-restrict-access">Auto analysts were left scratching their heads</a>, noting that demand for CarPlay and Android Auto was “massive” and that GM was taking a huge risk by cutting off access. </p>

  <p id="P4BP1I"><em>Galaxy Quest</em> is the best <em>Star Trek</em> movie. I’m not trying to start fights here. This isn’t a Picard versus Kirk situation. This is just the facts. There have been a lot of <em>Star Trek</em> movies, and none have managed to blend the whimsy and curiosity of the franchise with the action and grand scale of film as well as <em>Galaxy Quest</em>.</p>
<p id="mtgNRI">But <em>Galaxy Quest</em>, the 1999 film starring Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, and Alan Rickman, also technically isn’t <em>Star Trek</em>; it's a film about the cast of a <em>Star Trek</em>-like series who find themselves stopping actual evil aliens from committing genocide.</p>
<p id="HEAReJ">But now Paramount Plus, the home of all things <em>Star Trek</em>, is looking to adapt the film into a TV series... so I can understand if you’re confused about its relationship...</p>

<p id="IbnCLQ">You can add links by editing your profile in the mobile app, where you can give them titles and reorder how they’ll appear. However, if you’ve added more than one link, anyone visiting your profile will still have to click through a “[Your first link] and 1 other” message to see that list of links. That means that, if you have more than one link you have to feature on either your Instagram profile or already use a “Link in bio” service like Linktree, people are going to have to do an extra click to see your links no matter what.</p>

  <p id="66cJ2O">YouTube will remove additional videos related to eating disorders, including content that shows or discusses “imitable behavior,” the company <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-updated-approach-to-eating-disorder-related-content/">announced</a> today.</p>
<p id="a6qYWt">Videos promoting or glorifying eating disorders are already banned on YouTube, but this policy update expands the rules to include content that shows or describes eating disorder behaviors that audiences could imitate.

  <p id="9qhOT1">It’s a complaint we’ve all heard by now and maybe one you’ve vented about firsthand: voices and conversations <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYJtb2YXae8">are often too difficult to understand</a> when watching TV. I know many people who routinely enable closed captioning — even if they’re not hard of hearing — to be sure they don’t miss anything. Many soundbars and some TVs have added various speech enhancement modes to overcome this, but if you’re stuck with shoddy built-in TV speakers, unintelligible conversation can become very aggravating.</p>
<p id="OPgpB4">With Prime Video, Amazon has decided to do something about this dilemma at the software level. Today, the company is <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/prime-video-dialogue-boost">introducing a new Dialogue Boost mode</a> that can be toggled on from any device that offers the streaming service. “Dialogue Boost...</p>

Software as a service (SaaS), to be more specific. </p>

  <p id="VImvli">Xiaomi has just announced a new Ultra variant of the Xiaomi 13 that features not one but four 50-megapixel cameras in its substantial rear camera bump. The Xiaomi 13 Ultra will be available in China this month but will eventually release in international markets, <a href="https://twitter.com/leijun/status/1643891766482067456">according to Lei Jun, the company’s founder and CEO</a>.</p>
<p id="kqzNfH">Like the Xiaomi 13 Pro before it, the Xiaomi 13 Ultra utilizes a massive one-inch type sensor for its main camera. But new for this version is that the <a href="https://twitter.com/leijun/status/1646770264536154113">aperture of the Ultra’s main camera is variable</a> and supports an aperture of either f/1.9 or f/4.0. That should give photographers more control in their photography, particularly when it comes to how much depth of field their shots have. </p>

  <p id="5jxUhS">Even if your goal is to lose weight, the number on the scale <a href="https://www.verywellfit.com/reasons-to-ditch-the-scale-1231549">isn’t always the best measure of progress</a>. In that vein, Withings’ new Body Smart scale is adding an “eyes closed” mode. Instead of displaying your weight, the scale will instead show encouraging messages or metrics like step count, air quality, and the weather. </p>
<p id="gSRsVv">It might seem odd to exclude weight on a scale, but it’s a helpful feature for folks who want to track their health but may have a history of disordered eating, are easily discouraged, or want to focus on other measures of progress like muscle gain. Or you could merely want to keep your weight private and viewable only within the app. This isn’t the first time we’ve seen this kind of feature.

And it will go on sale first in China starting in late 2023, followed by North America in 2024. </p>
