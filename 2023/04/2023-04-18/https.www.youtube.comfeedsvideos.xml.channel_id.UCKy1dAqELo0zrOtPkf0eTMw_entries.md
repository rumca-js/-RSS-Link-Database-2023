Artificial Intelligence going rogue and bringing about the demise of humanity is a classic sci-fi story concept, so we're assembling a list of the most iconic evil AI to ever gain malicious sentience. We're talking Skynet from the Terminator franchise, the machines and Agents from the Matrix, and Ultron from Avengers: Age of Ultron.

## Dead Island 2 Review

Dead Island 2 reviewed by Travis Northup on PlayStation 5 and PC. Also available on Xbox.
Dead Island 2 is a hysterical Los Angeles-infused satire that does most things well enough, but feels like a stroll down the Walk of Fame of celebrated zombie games I’ve already played without adding many new ideas of its own. In fact, aside from the stellar comedy bits, I can think of very few things that Dead Island 2 does better than last year’s Dying Light 2. Still, if you’ve ever wanted to put your Wolverine claws straight through a zombie’s face or knock someone’s head off with a golf club, Dead Island 2’s got you. Its bloodsoaked melee combat and memorable characters are a lot of fun, especially when accompanied by friends in co-op multiplayer. The somewhat generic crafting weapons and upgrading your skills as you lay waste to armies of spray-tanned undead is entertaining enough on its own, but the strong writing and completely irreverent tone are the true stars of the show.
