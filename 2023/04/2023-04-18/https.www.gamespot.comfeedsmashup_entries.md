Deadline reports that a search for a new lead is underway, though notes that Willem Dafoe is still attached. Majors was also reportedly considering the lead role in an Otis Redding biopic called Otis and Zelma, but has been dropped from consideration.</p><p>Additionally, Majors was set to appear in an ad campaign for the Texas Rangers baseball team, with the first spot to air this Friday--but it was pulled at the last minute following the allegations.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jonathan-majors-dropped-from-movies-ad-campaign-amid-domestic-assault-allegations/1100-6513365/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p> The John Wick franchise started with just a single, self-contained action movie starring Keanu Reeves in the now-iconic role. John Wick Chapter 4 director wants to give Wick himself a rest, but he has a list of other actors he'd love to work with, he revealed in a new interview with <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/john-wick-5-sequel-actors-exclusive">The Direct</a>.</p><p>"The first thing that came to mindset [sic] was Cillian Murphy," Stahelski said. "I'm a big Peaky Blinders fan, so you know, I just think Cillian would fit right on. Colin Farrell is fantastic. Charlize Theron when she did Atomic Blonde, I saw that, went 'Oh my god, I gotta work with this woman. She's awesome. I worked with Michelle Yeoh way back on a commercial, and I've been dying to work with her ever since."</p><p>Other actors Stahelski called out include Birds of Prey actor Jurnee Smollett, Robert Downey Jr, Peter Dinklage, and Sean Bean.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/john-wick-director-wants-to-work-with-charlize-theron-robert-downey-jr-and-more/1100-6513364/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Netflix has announced its intention to implement a "broad rollout" of its paid-sharing plan in the second quarter of 2023, including in the United States, as part of its efforts to crack down on password sharing outside of households. The announcement was made in the <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2023/q1/Final-Q1-23-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">company's first quarter 2023 earnings report</a>, where Netflix revealed its satisfaction with the results of the plan's initial launch in four countries.</p><p dir="ltr">The four markets where Netflix has already introduced the paid-sharing option are Canada, New Zealand, Portugal, and Spain. In February, Netflix introduced the "buy an extra member" feature in these countries, allowing primary account holders to pay an additional monthly fee for a sub-account that can be used by 1-2 people who do not live with them.</p><p dir="ltr">Netflix has been explicit in its guidelines that an account is intended to be shared within one household, which is defined as people who live in the same location as the account owner. The company has stated on its customer-help section of the website that individuals who are not part of the account owner's household should sign up for their own account in order to access Netflix content. However, Netflix members are still allowed to access the service while traveling using their personal devices or by logging in to new TVs, such as those in hotels or vacation rentals.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-plans-broad-rollout-of-password-sharing-crackdown-in-q2-2023/1100-6513362/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Not counting that movie, Disney's Frozen II tops the charts with $1.45 billion, followed by Frozen ($1.28 billion), Incredibles 2 ($1.24 billion), and Minions ($1.16 billion).</p><p>The Super Mario Bros.

## Minecraft Legends - What To Do First

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft-legends/">Minecraft Legends</a>, the third-person RTS game set in the Minecraft universe, has finally arrived. Meant as an introduction to strategy games, Minecraft Legends offers a simpler version of the game genre, similar to how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft-dungeons/">Minecraft Dungeons</a> led players gently into Diablo-like action-RPGs. However, once you make it a few hours into the main campaign, you get let loose into the open world with the overall objective of defeating the Piglins. Here's what you should focus on first in Minecraft Legends.</p><h2 dir="ltr">After destroying the Night Beacon base</h2><p dir="ltr">After destroying the Night Beacon base, you will enter the regular day/night cycle of Minecraft Legends, where the Piglins either attack a village or upgrade a base every night. During the day you are free to explore, upgrade villages, and attack Piglin bases. A top priority should be placing defensives at each village, primarily building a wall and setting up arrow towers. Luckily, <strong>you are told each day which village the Piglins are targeting</strong> so you don't need to worry about getting surprised.</p><p dir="ltr">After setting up proper defenses, you will want to begin building permanent upgrade buildings at the center of the map. In order to build these upgrades you will need materials, including <strong>Prismarine</strong>, which is obtained primarily from destroying enemy bases. As for which upgrades you should get first, the Redstone upgrade, increased inventory space, and increased army size upgrades are all great picks to start with. Redstone in particular allows you to build the Redstone cannon, which makes breaching enemy walls much easier. <strong>The Netherrack removal upgrade is also great, because it lets you set up your forces close to the enemy base by clearing the area for building.</strong></p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-legends-what-to-do-first/1100-6513358/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghostwire-tokyo/">GhostWire: Tokyo</a> recently landed on Xbox consoles after a year of PlayStation 5 exclusivity, but a technical breakdown shows that many of the game's performance issues are still present a year later. Even worse, the title seems to generally perform worse on Xbox Series X.</p><p dir="ltr">A new analysis by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNEjdIq-jTk">Digital Foundry</a> shows that many of the same issues that plagued the PS5 version have carried over to Xbox. Those issues include a dizzying array of graphical options (most of which Digital Foundry does not recommend due to their effect on performance) rather than the choice between optimized performance or quality modes, as well as noticeable input lag and regular framer ate dips, even when playing on performance modes.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">All of those issues were present in the PS5 version of GhostWire: Tokyo, but more disappointing is that the game simply performs worse on Xbox Series X.

The PS5, in particular, can suffer from storage woes rather quickly, as it only has 667GB of usable space.

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dead-island-2/">Dead Island 2</a> players on base PS4 and Xbox One systems are unable to host online co-op games at launch.</p><p>Developer Dambuster Studios confirmed this in a <a href="https://deadisland.com/news/co-op?s=31">blog post</a>, stating that "Base Generation 8 consoles (PlayStation 4/Xbox One|S) will not be able to host the game at launch, but they will be able to join it." Players must be on either PS5, Xbox Series X|S, or PC to host a game. The developer did note that PS4 Pro and Xbox One X players will also be able to host co-op games, and explains that it's "working on giving the option to host on all consoles in the future."</p><p>In the same blog post, Dambuster also mentioned that Dead Island 2 will support cross-gen play, meaning PS4 and PS5 players can play together, while Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S players can do the same. Players must reach the "Call the Cavalry" mission in order to begin cooperative play online, which is around 30 minutes into the game.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-island-2-players-cant-host-co-op-games-if-theyre-on-a-base-model-last-gen-console/1100-6513349/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## The Sims 4's Latest Kits Are All About Greenhouses And Basements

<p dir="ltr">EA and Maxis have announced a couple of new kits for The Sims 4, one all about greenhouses, the other about basement trinkets.</p><p dir="ltr">The Greenhouse Haven Kit offers up an opportunity for you to craft greenhouse spaces, being described as a kit that "has something for every Sim with or without a green thumb in this new, dedicated gardening space." You'll be able to design greenhouses with "beautiful pane windows and doors that fit together seamlessly," and can make it a calm relaxing space, or a cluttered plant-filled area with a number of new gardening objects like stacks of pots, a planting table, hanging flower basket, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">For those that want to recreate their messy basement that's full of stuff you promise you'll organise eventually and things that make you say "Oh, hey, I remember this," like milk crates filled with vinyl records, old trophies and family photos, worn trunks, and more. Eagled-eyed Sims fans might notice a particular bed that's resting up against a wall image, notably known as the heart-shaped bed from the original Sims, the first bed you could get that would let Sims engage in "play." Love isn't dead; it's just in the basement.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-4s-latest-kits-are-all-about-greenhouses-and-basements/1100-6513347/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Star Wars Battlefront 3 Was Canceled "2 Yards From The Finish Line," Dev Says

<p>A developer who worked on Star Wars Battlefront III has claimed the game was "two yards from the finish line" before it was canceled many years ago. Developer Michael Barclay, who now works at Naughty Dog, made these comments in response to a Twitter thread where developers discussed the projects they worked on that amounted to "the one that got away."</p><p>To be clear, Barclay is talking about a Battlefront game in development at Free Radical Design in the mid-2000s, not the newer series from DICE. That's an important point because <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-rejected-star-wars-battlefront-3-pitch-report/1100-6498250/">EA is said to have rejected DICE's pitch for a third Star Wars Battlefront game.</a></p><p>Barclay said the cancellation of Free Radical's Battlefront III was an "absolute crime." Barclay added, "Gamers don't know what they were robbed of." <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mabarclay/">Barclay's LinkedIn page</a> said they worked on Battlefront III from 2007-2009 at Free Radical, contributing to the game's single-player and multiplayer elements.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-battlefront-3-was-canceled-2-yards-from-the-finish-line-dev-says/1100-6513342/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

To see her finally get her moment is a dream come true in a year that's shown me the incredible power of never giving up on your dreams."</p><p dir="ltr">Executive producer Alex Kurtzman shared that Yeoh had the idea for a spin-off for her character even before the first season of Star Trek: Discovery aired in 2017. "Everyone on Team Trek couldn't be more thrilled to have our legendary friend return home to us as we expand our storytelling into new and uncharted corners of the Trekverse," Kurtzman said.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/michelle-yeoh-to-reprise-role-as-emperor-georgiou-in-star-trek-section-31-movie/1100-6513344/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Nintendo has released new firmware for the Switch. And while Version <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22525/session/">16.0.2</a> is light on specific changes, dataminers have uncovered a few unlisted changes that are worth noting. As usual, Nintendo's patch notes are lacking in specifics, citing only "general system stability improvements to enhance the user experience."</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">[Nintendo Switch Firmware Update]<br /><br />Version 16.0.2 is now out.<br /><br />The bad words list and the SSL module (handles establishing secure connections to servers) was updated.<br /><br />The word “adhd” was added to the Japanese bad words list.

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/disney-speedstorm/">Disney Speedstorm</a> is the (soon-to-be) free-to-play Disney kart racer that seems inevitable in retrospect. Combining a laundry list of Disney and Pixar characters and locations with the kart racing genre makes so much sense, though in Disney Speedstorm, your roster may look quite a bit different from others due to the way characters are unlocked. If you're wondering who is in the game and how you might buckle their seatbelts and take them for a spin, here's the complete Disney Speedstorm character list and how to unlock all of them.</p><h2>Disney Speedstorm characters</h2><p>You can break down the list of available racers into two (or more, if you're particular) categories: those who are unlocked right away, and those who you must unlock in other, less obvious ways. The following characters are available for play right away in the game's local and online private matches, as well as online public matches once multiplayer is unlocked via the main campaign:</p><ul><li>Mickey Mouse</li><li>Donald Duck</li><li>Mulan</li><li>Captain Jack Sparrow</li><li>Hercules</li></ul><p>Several more characters can be seen in-game, though their unlock requirements vary in some instances. Players with the Ultimate Founder's Pack can select <strong>one</strong> additional character from the following list to have them instantly unlocked:</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-speedstorm-character-list-how-to-unlock-all-characters/1100-6512973/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Review Roundup For Dead Island 2

<div> </div><p dir="ltr">Dead Island 2 was announced almost a decade ago, but it's finally out this week, with reviews coming in giving us an idea of what the game is like. The verdict? Depends on who you ask.</p><p dir="ltr">Gameplay-wise, it seems that across the board the opinion is that the game isn't doing anything unique or even necessarily better than other, similar games, though it has a bit more to offer as you progress through it. Story-wise opinions are split, with some outlets highlighting the writing, while others finding it a bit lacking, and occasionally finding the character irritating. Another issue is that when it comes to crossplay, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-island-2-crossplay-and-co-op-explained/1100-6513005/">you won't be able to play with someone on a different platform than you</a>, so make sure you plan to pick the game up on the appropriate console.</p><p dir="ltr">"Exploration, combat, and upgrades all shine, which is helpful when the story is so forgettable," wrote Mark Delayney in GameSpot's Dead Island 2 review. "Though the sequel is written by a different team than the original, Dead Island 2's writing suffers from problems that tie them together like a familiar bouquet of unexplained motivations, grating dialogue, and a bad final act that races past a would-be charming level of campiness and crashes into groan-inducing territory.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/review-roundup-for-dead-island-2/1100-6513340/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><h2>Big deals.</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4126926-screenshot2023-04-18at10.25.53am.png" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Many mature industries trend toward consolidation as time goes on, and the video game business is no different. Big companies are bought and sold for massive sums of money. This was made evident yet again recently when Sega splashed out $776 million to acquire Angry Birds developer Rovio, which was the second high-profile deal in 2023, following Savvy Games Group paying $4.9 billion to acquire mobile and social game developer Scopely. But what are the biggest of the big buyouts? Here in this post, we're rounding up the top 10 most expensive video game acquisitions of all time, a list that's topped by Microsoft's pending $68.7 billion bid to buy Activision Blizzard in what is far and away the biggest gaming deal in history. It's also one of the biggest acquisitions–across all markets from oil and energy to technology.</p><p dir="ltr">Microsoft actually makes the list three times, the most of any single company, spending around $79.3 billion on video game buyouts since 2014 (a sum that includes the proposed deal for Activision Blizzard). Another trend is many of the biggest deals are focused on mobile titles. Companies like Take-Two, EA, and Tencent snapped up established mobile game studios to help give them a bigger piece of the pie as it relates to potential earning possibilities, and Microsoft has cited mobile as a big motivating factor behind its attempted Activision Blizzard acquisition.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>10: EA - Glu Mobile – $2.4 billion (2021)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4126927-kimk.png" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">The 10th biggest acquisition in the history of video games came in 2021 when Electronic Arts splashed out $2.4 billion to acquire Glu Mobile, the developer of many mobile titles. One of its marquee games is Kim Kardashian's mobile game, but the company's roster includes a range of others, such as Disney Sorcerer's Arena, Diner Dash Adventures, and Deer Hunter. Similar to why Activision Blizzard bought King and why Take-Two bought Zynga, EA purchased Glu to help advance and accelerate its position in the mobile game market. EA bought Glu to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/to-make-more-microtransaction-money-ea-buys-prolific-mobile-game-studio-glu-for-21-billion/1100-6487276/">make more money from microtransactions and live services</a>, and because mobile is, simply put, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-bought-the-kim-kardashian-game-company-because-mobile-is-bigger-than-console-and-pc/1100-6487362/">gigantic market and big-time revenue-driver</a>.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>9: Microsoft - Mojang – $2.5 billion (2014)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4126928-screenshot2023-04-18at10.29.30am.png" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>Before Microsoft bought ZeniMax or announced plans to pick up Activision Blizzard, the company made a gigantic purchase in 2014 for Mojang and the Minecraft series. Microsoft paid $2.5 billion for the studio and the franchise, and has since released new entries in the series, including Minecraft Legends most recently. Since Microsoft bought Mojang, it's continued to release Minecraft games on PlayStation and Nintendo platforms, rather than making them exclusive to Xbox. The company has said it would do the same for Call of Duty if allowed to purchase Activision Blizzard.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>8: Sony - Bungie – $3.6 billion (2022)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1593/15930215/3611175-s9_screenshots_3.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Microsoft may be in the process of acquiring the Call of Duty series, but Sony's deal to buy another prominent FPS studio, Bungie, is already done and dusted. In 2022, Sony announced it would pay $3.6 billion to acquire Bungie and the Destiny series. Destiny is a beloved juggernaut, but Sony is obviously looking beyond that game as well and hoping <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-developer-bungie-has-a-number-of-unannounced-games-in-the-works/1100-6510329/">Bungie will strike gold again with its future games. </a>Not only that, but Sony has said it's keen to lean on Bungie's experience in the live-service department to help with PlayStation's overall live-service push (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-sales-surpass-17-million-10-live-service-games-coming-by-2026/1100-6500204/">Sony plans to have 10 live-service games in the market by 2026</a>).</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7: ByteDance - Mononton – $4 billion (2021)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4126932-screenshot2023-04-18at10.32.50am.png" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>In March 2021, TikTok owner ByteDance announced its games division, Nuverse, would pay $4 billion to buy the Shanghai-based game developer Moonton Technology. This is part of ByteDance's push into the video game business and makes it more of a competitor with another Chinese company, Tencent. Moonton is best known for its MOBA Mobile Legends. It was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bytedance-videogames-mooton/bytedance-acquires-gaming-studio-moonton-at-around-4-billion-valuation-sources-idUSKBN2BE0ES">reported by Reuters</a> that Tencent made an offer for Moonton before ByteDance beat it.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6: Savvy Games Group - Scopely – $4.9 billion (2023)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4126933-savvy.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">In April 2023, the Saudi Arabia-owned Savvy Games Group purchased mobile and social game developer Scopely for $4.9 billion. You might not know Scopely by name, but the company has worked on games in juggernaut franchises like Star Trek, The Walking Dead, and Marvel. It's also behind the game Stumble Guys, a colorful battle royale game that is seemingly inspired by Mediatonic's Fall Guys.</p><p>Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund has been making major investments in the gaming space through Savvy for some time already. In addition to buying Scopely outright, Savvy holds minority ownership positions in Capcom, Nexon, EA, and Take-Two. Savvy also owns 40 million shares of Activision Blizzard and is in line for a huge payday if Microsoft's deal to buy Activision Blizzard goes through. What's more, Saudi Arabia owns more than 8% of Nintendo and is the Mario company's largest outside investor. Savvy Games Group has <em>major </em>plans to continue to expand and create its own game development ecosystem, so watch this space for more.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5: Activision Blizzard - King – $5.9 billion (2015)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4126934-screenshot2023-04-18at10.35.05am.png" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">In 2015, Activision Blizzard announced it would buy Candy Crush developer King for $5.9 billion to help expand its footprint in the mobile games space. Candy Crush remains a juggernaut on mobile, and those revenues have been flowing to Activision Blizzard for years now. Should Microsoft get approval to purchase Activision Blizzard, the Xbox company will take ownership of Candy Crush and the numerous other mobile games Activision Blizzard is developing. In fact, Activision Blizzard has said it will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-will-bring-all-of-its-franchises-to-mobile/1100-6484031/">make a mobile game for every one of its franchises. </a></p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4: Microsoft - ZeniMax – $8.1 billion (2020)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1576/15769789/3246670-fallout_4_vr_vats_watermark_1497052481.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>Microsoft's second-biggest purchase in the gaming space was the $8.1 billion it paid to acquire ZeniMax in 2020. ZeniMax is the parent company of Bethesda Game Studios, the makers of The Elder Scrolls and Fallout, among others. Microsoft acquired all of ZeniMax's teams and series, meaning Starfield, The Elder Scrolls 6, Fallout 5, the next Wolfenstein game, and more will be Microsoft games going forward. The transition wasn't totally smooth, however, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-10000-people-cuts-reportedly-include-xbox-and-bethesda/1100-6510650/">Microsoft recently laid off staff on its games teams, including Bethesda.</a> The deal has also generated some debate and discussion about Microsoft taking formerly multiplatform franchises and making them exclusive to Xbox.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3: Tencent - Supercell – $8.6 billion (2016)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4126936-screenshot2023-04-18at10.36.07am.png" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>Chinese internet giant Tencent has made a number of investments and acquisitions of studios around the world, and Clash of Clans developer Supercell is its biggest buyout of the bunch. In 2016, Tencent announced plans to acquire a majority stake in Supercell for about $8.6 billion. To put this number into perspective and as an example of the growing size of M&amp;A activity in the video game sector, Tencent paid about $400 million to buy League of Legends developer Riot back in 2011.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2: Take-Two - Zynga – $12.7 billion (2022)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1179/11799911/4126938-screenshot2023-04-18at10.37.32am.png" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Grand Theft Auto and NBA 2K parent company Take-Two Interactive announced in January 2022 that it would purchase FarmVille giant Zynga for $12.7 billion. At the time, it was far and away the biggest acquisition in the history of video games, only to be outdone by Microsoft a few weeks later.

The technology giant has spent the past year taking various steps to convince regulatory bodies to approve the deal, and while Microsoft has indeed made good headway, several key hurdles remain. In the US, the FTC has sued Microsoft to try to block the deal, a move that harkens back to the United States vs. Microsoft lawsuit levied against the company over monopolization concerns in the PC market. In the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority raised anti-competitive concerns, too. Microsoft agreed to pay $95 per share to get it done, a significant premium over the share price when the deal was announced.

## Fortnite Lock-On Pistol: Where To Get One And How It Works

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> fans know that Epic will always supply them with an ever-growing selection of unique and fun weapons to use in battle royale, but few may have expected the game's newest addition. The Lock-On Pistol does precisely what it sounds like, providing players with the ability to shoot foes with homing bullets at close range--much like Titanfall's Smart Pistol--somewhat reducing the effort of aiming (though not entirely). Here's where to get a Lock-On Pistol and how it works.</p><h2>Where to get a Lock-On Pistol in Fortnite and how it works</h2><p>The Lock-On Pistol can be found on the ground, in chests, or from supply drops, meaning that finding one shouldn't be a significantly difficult task. However, don't pick one up assuming that it's going to do all of the work for you, as you'll still need to put a bit of work in upfront to get the Lock-On Pistol to do its thing. You'll need to aim it at your target for a bit and wait for the angled lines of the crosshairs to fully turn pink. You can then fire the gun and watch as the bullet tracks and hits your enemy.</p><p>Body shots with the Lock-On Pistol won't hit as hard as some other options, so it's not necessarily an overpowered option to add to your arsenal in a match, but it can be especially useful at landing a few shots on unsuspecting enemies--if you're sneaky enough. But regardless of whether you want to keep one of these new pistols on you at all times or not, a Season 2 Week 6 challenges asks you to dish out 200 damage with one, so it's worth finding and using if you're wanting to score all of the battle pass cosmetics this season.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-lock-on-pistol-where-to-get-one-and-how-it-works/1100-6513330/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Nintendo hacker Gary Bowser, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bowser-sentenced-to-more-than-three-years-in-prison/1100-6500590/">who was sentenced to 40 months in jail</a> for piracy and received a hefty fine of close to $15 million for his involvement in the hacking group Team Xecutor, has now been released from prison. Having served several months of his sentence, Bowser has been released early in part due to good behavior and time already served, but he is still legally obligated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bowser-owes-nintendo-even-more-money/1100-6498689/">to pay Nintendo $10 million</a> for his role in allowing Switch owners to hack their systems so that pirated games could be played on them.</p><p>As part of the consent judgment that Bowser agreed to, Nintendo will be allowed to take "25-30%" of his gross monthly income. Of the $10 million that Bowser owes Nintendo, he has only been able to pay $175 so far from his earnings while he was in prison. "I've been making payments of $25 per month, which they've been taking from my income because I had a job in federal prison.

"This is a very significant moment for us. It's the purchase of video games that sustains Nintendo and the Nintendo ecosystem, and it is the games that make the people smile. It's for that reason that we do all we can to prevent games on Nintendo systems from being stolen," Singh said to Axios last year.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-hacker-gary-bowser-released-from-prison-but-he-still-owes-a-lot-of-money/1100-6513332/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>It has come to light that Marvel Studios reportedly filmed a lengthy scene for 2018's Avengers: Infinity War that didn't make the final cut. It would have seemingly shown a notable event that happens off-screen. The scene in question involves Thanos (Josh Brolin) and how he came to obtain the first Infinity Stone.</p><p>The film doesn't explain how Thanos already has the first stone when the movie kicks off, but this scene would have dug into that lore. Thanos creator Jim Starlin told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ial9-5gZq0">Near Mint Condition</a> that Marvel Studios filmed a 45-minute scene that depicted Thanos laying waste to Xandar to obtain the Power Stone.</p><div>          </div><p>The scene was ultimately left on the cutting room floor, and viewers were left to understand that Thanos obtained the stone off-screen. 2014's Guardians of the Galaxy saw the superhero team obtain the stone and <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Stone">give it to Nova Corps for safe-keeping</a>, but that didn't go to plan.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avengers-infinity-war-originally-had-an-epic-45-minute-deleted-scene-that-explained-a-key-detail/1100-6513328/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>It has come to light that Marvel Studios reportedly filmed a lengthy scene for 2018's Avengers: Infinity War that didn't make the final cut. It would have seemingly shown a notable event that happens off-screen. The scene in question involves Thanos (Josh Brolin) and how he came to obtain the first Infinity Stone.</p><p>The film doesn't explain how Thanos already has the first stone when the movie kicks off, but this scene would have dug into that lore. Thanos creator Jim Starlin told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ial9-5gZq0">Near Mint Condition</a> that Marvel Studios filmed a 45-minute scene that depicted Thanos laying waste to Xandar to obtain the Power Stone.</p><div>          </div><p>The scene was ultimately left on the cutting room floor, and viewers were left to understand that Thanos obtained the stone off-screen. 2014's Guardians of the Galaxy saw the superhero team obtain the stone and <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Stone">give it to Nova Corps for safe-keeping</a>, but that didn't go to plan.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avengers-infinity-war-originally-had-an-epic-45-minute-scene-that-explained-a-key-detail/1100-6513328/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

But they just directed us in what kind of street clothes to wear, like what colors and stuff. We didn't actually get in a superhero costume," she said,<a href="https://comicbook.com/movies/news/the-white-lotus-star-haley-lu-richardson-failed-marvel-audition/"> as reported by ComicBook</a>.

<p dir="ltr">Pokemon Go developer Niantic has announced its next major mobile game: Monster Hunter Now. The collaboration with Capcom will bring Rathalos to your neighborhood via augmented reality in September 2023.</p><p dir="ltr">Monster Hunter Now will let players hunt monsters in the real world, with regions around the world assigned specific ecological areas that spawn specific monsters. Fighting monsters will use tap and swipe controls depending on the equipped weapon, and weapons and armor can be forged and upgraded using materials earned from defeated monsters. Notably, each fight against an encountered monster will only last a maximum of 75 seconds, which is a major shift from the usual 10-20 minute battles found throughout the franchise.</p><figure style="width: 1080px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4126534-03_multi-play_02_horizontal.jpg"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4126534-03_multi-play_02_horizontal.jpg" /></a></figure><figure><div class="image-gallery__label">Gallery</div>   <div class="image-gallery__list hide-scrollbar">       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4126535-01_map_01.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 1" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4126535-01_map_01.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4126536-01_map_02_mining.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 2" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4126536-01_map_02_mining.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4126537-01_map_03_mining.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 3" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4126537-01_map_03_mining.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4126538-01_map_04_rathalos.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 4" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4126538-01_map_04_rathalos.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4126539-01_map_05_greatjagras.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 5" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4126539-01_map_05_greatjagras.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4126540-02_hunt_01_rathalos_sword_shield.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 6" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4126540-02_hunt_01_rathalos_sword_shield.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4126541-02_hunt_02_greatjagras_sword_shield.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 7" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4126541-02_hunt_02_greatjagras_sword_shield.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4126542-02_hunt_05_pukei-pukei_longsword.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 8" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4126542-02_hunt_05_pukei-pukei_longsword.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4126543-03_multi-play_01_vertical.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 9" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4126543-03_multi-play_01_vertical.jpg" />     </a>   </div>  </figure><p dir="ltr">Players can also team up against larger monsters, as the game's multiplayer features will automatically link players together who are pursuing a certain monster on the map.
