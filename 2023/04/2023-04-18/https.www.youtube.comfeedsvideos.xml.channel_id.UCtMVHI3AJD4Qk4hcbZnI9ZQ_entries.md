Hello guys and gals, it's me Mutahar again! This time we take a look at what appears to be a lost mod for GTA: Vice City on the original Xbox. Someone modded a version of Silent Hill into this console port that the community who hunted myths thought to be missing. One day a user buys a secondhand console only to discover this game sitting on the hard drive, thankfully modders came by and helped extract so we all can finally play it. Thanks for watching!
