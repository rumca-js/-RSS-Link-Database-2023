But just look at the state of this philanthropic multi-billionaire! As Chelsea prepare for a season-defining Big Cup match against Real Madrid, most of the talk is not of the players, or Frank Lampard\u2019s win percentage in his second spell as manager, or even his draw percentage. It\u2019s D\u2019oh!ly, whose dressing-room pep talk after the defeat by Brighton on Saturday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/17/todd-boehly-tells-chelsea-season-embarrassing-dressing-room-brighton-real-madrid\">has leaked faster</a> than b@nterous first-leg predictions from his overenthusiastic mouth. D\u2019oh!ly reportedly called Chelsea\u2019s season \u201cembarrassing\u201d, after which, according to the National Grid, there was a surge in pot/kettle analogies, and singled out one player \u2013 bought for big money in the last 12 months, and yes this stuff does write itself \u2013 for criticism. In the bowels of Stamford Bridge, it seems, there isn\u2019t much looking glass. D\u2019oh!ly\u2019s combination of enthusiasm, power and ignorance are in danger of setting USA! USA!! USA!!!-UK football relations back 20 years, and they weren\u2019t exactly thriving before he invited Jesse Marsch to hold his watery beer.</p><p>So, Todd Boehly chats to the players after every game. Perhaps he could spare a minute to chat to us Chelsea fans \u2013 we\u2019d love to hear the thinking behind buying an unmanageably large squad, but no one to score a goal, and having more managers in a season than Roman Abramovich could have dreamed of\u201d \u2013 Mike Davis.</p><p>After the weekend\u2019s usual video-based officiating shenanigans, my son and I have decided to tentatively punt a better alternative. Rather than referring to a bunch of people in a shed, we humbly suggest referring to an ordinary football-watching person on a sofa with their Tin \u2013 arguably a better-versed authority \u2013 for a decision following several replays. It, of course would be known as BAR\u201d \u2013 Peter Logan.</p><p><em><strong>This is an extract from our daily football email \u2026 Football Daily.

It was a casual comment that ignited her illness. It often is, apparently. A skinny girl said to her: \u201cI wish I was normal like you.\u201d \u201cNormal\u201d triggered what would become her abnormal struggle (a \u201ctrigger\u201d, she points out, is not the same as a \u201ccause\u201d). She grew up in a Jewish-American family \u2013 loving, comfortably off \u2013 and came to England from New York, aged 11. At home, she believes she absorbed the subtext that \u201cfood was the medium through which women express unhappiness\u201d. She debunks the oversimplification that anorexia is caused by the fashion industry\u2019s insistence on skeletal models, but emphasises that \u201cthe association between female self-denial and perfect femininity is entrenched in our culture. This doesn\u2019t cause anorexia, but it gives it a fertile ground in which to breed.\u201d She investigates new theories about the illness, including its possible connections with autism, OCD and metabolic rate. The book is garnished with expert opinion from doctors, psychiatrists and co-anorexics encountered in hospital, with whom she has been back in touch. Her tendency is to challenge reflex opinion and never to make the mistake of claiming to know more than is known. For whatever you thought you knew, the truth about anorexia is always more complicated. One of her most unnerving assertions is that anorexia is \u201cnot a desire to be thin \u2013 it is a desire to look ill\u201d.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/18/good-girls-a-story-and-study-of-anorexia-by-hadley-freeman-review\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/18/good-girls-a-story-and-study-of-anorexia-by-hadley-freeman-review", "date_published": "2023-04-18 06:00:38+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Pity the coronation chefs \u2013 theirs is a thankless and debasing task", "description": "<p>Creating a commemorative recipe is tricky.

Grasses cover the North American prairies, the African savannahs and the Eurasian steppes, which span 5,000 miles from the Caucasus to the Pacific Ocean. A second criterion is the number and diversity of species. Since the time grasses originated, they have evolved into more than 10,000 species with an astonishing variety of forms, from centimetre-high tufts of hair grass adapted to the freezing cold of Antarctica to the towering grasses of northern India that can hide entire elephant herds, and to Asian bamboo forests, with \u201ctrees\u201d that grow up to 30 metres tall.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/apr/18/evolution-biology-sleeping-beauties-innovations-that-wait-millions-of-years-to-come-good\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/apr/18/evolution-biology-sleeping-beauties-innovations-that-wait-millions-of-years-to-come-good", "date_published": "2023-04-18 05:00:36+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Thousands fled to Mastodon after Musk bought Twitter.
