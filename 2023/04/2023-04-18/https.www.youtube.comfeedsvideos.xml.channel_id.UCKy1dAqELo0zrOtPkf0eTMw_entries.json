Also available on Xbox.\nDead Island 2 is a hysterical Los Angeles-infused satire that does most things well enough, but feels like a stroll down the Walk of Fame of celebrated zombie games I\u2019ve already played without adding many new ideas of its own. In fact, aside from the stellar comedy bits, I can think of very few things that Dead Island 2 does better than last year\u2019s Dying Light 2. Still, if you\u2019ve ever wanted to put your Wolverine claws straight through a zombie\u2019s face or knock someone\u2019s head off with a golf club, Dead Island 2\u2019s got you. Its bloodsoaked melee combat and memorable characters are a lot of fun, especially when accompanied by friends in co-op multiplayer. The somewhat generic crafting weapons and upgrading your skills as you lay waste to armies of spray-tanned undead is entertaining enough on its own, but the strong writing and completely irreverent tone are the true stars of the show.\n\n#IGN #DeadIsland #Gaming", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw0CjiEs7sE", "date_published": "2023-04-18 14:00:42+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania - Exclusive Official Deleted Scene (2023) - David Dastmalchian", "description": "Veb (David Dastmalchian) expresses great excitement when he discovers he finally has holes in this unfinished scene from Marvel Studios\u2019 Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania.
