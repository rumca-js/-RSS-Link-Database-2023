The resolution cited "more than 5,500,000 illegal aliens crossing the United States southern border during Secretary Mayorkas’ term in office, including 20 consecutive months with more than 150,000 illegal border crossings and a 180 percent increase in encounters at the southern border compared to the previous administration."

<p>Senator Josh Hawley also grilled Mayorkas over his disastrous border policies, specifically those that have forced migrant children into indentured servitude. Hawley asked Mayorkas about a New York Times report that claims the Biden administration ignored signs of a recent explosion in forced child labor. According to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/17/us/politics/migrant-child-labor-biden.html" target="_blank">report</a>, more than 250,000 unaccompanied migrant children have entered the country in the past two years, though Hawley cited a larger figure of 345,000. Many have been forced into indentured servitude to pay back smugglers. Hawley attributed this explosion to the Biden administration's decision not to apply <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/illegal-immigration-doocy-psaki" target="_blank">Title 42</a> expulsions to unaccompanied migrant children. </p><p>Mayorkas responded by criticizing the Trump administration. In 2023. After over two years since Trump has been in office. </p><p>Hawley did <em>not</em> like that. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p><em>"A moment ago you were crowing about the fact that you treated children so well, and yet we find tens of thousands of children who are forced to work as slaves because of your policies and you turn around and blame a prior administration." </em></p><p>This whole debacle serves as a good reminder that having a chaotic open border is <em>not</em> actually the kind response to a huge influx of refugees. It creates massive issues of human trafficking, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kiessling-fentanyl-testimony" target="_blank">drug trafficking</a>, and more. But our politicians have been hemming and hawing about our "broken immigration system" for years now, so I wouldn't expect an overnight fix. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## WATCH: Makers Of Guinness Released Bizarre Ad Featuring A Grandpa Who Teaches Grandson How To Do Makeup

It looks like it's not just <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-staffer-under-bus" target="_blank">Bud Light</a> that has gone off the woke deep end. Guinness has entered the chat. </p><p>Diageo, the makers of Guinness, recently released this ad for their J&amp;B whisky. The ad features a Spanish grandpa who is a tad obsessed with wearing makeup. The grandpa buys makeup in secret and puts it on in the dead of night so his family doesn't know. At the end, he shows his (apparently) <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/canada-powerlifting-trolling" target="_blank">transgender</a> grandchild how to use makeup, too. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>

<p>The ad originally aired last holiday season. Diageo said the ad, which is titled, "She," is intended to show that "the love that unites them is so great it can overcome any prejudice or barrier." Úrsula Mejía-Melgar, Diageo’s marketing director for Southern Europe, gave a statement to <a href="https://www.fox9.com/news/jb-whisky-christmas-commercial-grandfather-wears-makeup-transgender-acceptance" target="_blank">Fox9</a> explaining, "At J&amp;B we want everyone to feel free to celebrate at Christmas, to give visibility to a reality that thousands of people in the LGBTQ+ community face in seeking a safe space to be their true selves during the holiday season. ‘She’ is a story that invites everyone to celebrate Christmas freely.”</p><p><span></span>This whole ad just weirded me out, mostly because it has absolutely nothing to do with any sort of alcoholic beverages. Also because the grandpa woke up in the middle of the night to put on makeup. That's gotta be horribly disruptive to his circadian rhythm.  </p><p>Really though, why do commercials nowadays have zero relation to the products being advertised? In a few months, people will probably still remember this bizarre ad. But most people almost certainly will not remember what the ad was for - due to the fact that the product doesn't appear until the very end, and even then, only for a few seconds. I'm no marketing whiz, but that seems like a bad strategy. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## WATCH: Crowder Explains Latest Development In DeSantis's War On Disney's Woke BS

Down to the last gay detail. </p><p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/desantis-florida-blueprint" target="_blank">DeSantis</a> threatened a bunch of expansion projects in Disney's special district. Specifically, a state prison. But he noted the possibilities are endless. Crowder then highlighted one of DeSantis's latest pieces of legislation against <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/peter-pan-tinkerbell-disney" target="_blank">Disney</a>, aimed at limiting their self-governing power. The bill will be put out in the legislature, according to DeSantis, and would ensure all agreements Disney purports to enter into are revoked, and the "people's will is established and upheld". </p><p>Crowder pointed out how this entire war between Disney and DeSantis started over Disney's public opposition to the "Parental Rights in Education Bill," AKA the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nikki-haley-florida-parental-choice" target="_blank">"Don't Say Gay" </a>Bill. Which actually doesn't ban you from saying gay, by the way. Crowder highlighted how Disney's opposition to this bill is essentially the same as saying it's a requirement that the state hyper-sexualize children starting in kindergarten. DeSantis, as the leader of the state's government, rightfully moved to protect his citizens against this threat.  </p><p>Another interesting point, Crowder noted, is DeSantis's refusal to compromise with big corporations like Disney and Bud Light. DeSantis spoke out against Bud Light yesterday and said he won't drink the beer anymore, and that pushback is in order to prevent corporations from trying to change America. Crowder had been concerned DeSantis may be more willing to compromise with corporations to pull in donors, but that hasn't been the case. </p><p>So this was definitely a jam-packed segment. Plus, Crowder covered the latest shooting in Kansas City and how the media is refusing to tell the whole story behind it. There were also some riots in Chicago that the media doesn't want to talk about.

## LOL: Nancy Pelosi's Campaign Had To Pay A Dude $7.5K For Sending Him Too Many Fundraising Texts

She just couldn't leave this dude alone. Last October, Jorge Rojas filed a 13-page lawsuit against Pelosi's campaign and the Democratic fundraising platform ActBlue for violating the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, a law against robocalling. He initially sought damages of $1500 per text, totaling to $31,500. After receiving a $7,500 payout, however, he moved to dismiss the suit. </p><p>Rojas received a whopping 21 texts soliciting money between November 2021 and July 2022 even after he placed himself on the Do Not Call registry. The lawsuit includes the full text of some of the fundraising texts and reveals several of the appeals were sent *immediately* after the overturn of Roe vs. Wade. </p><p><em>"It's Nancy Pelosi - my heart is racing. The Supreme Court has officially voted to overturn Roe v. Wade. I need a historic response to meet this earth-shattering moment - 25,000 Democratic gifts in the next 24 hours - to replace every last anti-choice Republican who made this happen."</em>  Wonder how that went for her. </p><p>The lawsuit noted several texts contained images of Pelosi, and this Insider reporter kindly shared a screenshot from his own phone of what such a text looks like. It seems like it would definitely warrant a $30k lawsuit. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cNEW \u2014 have you ever received a Pelosi fundraising text like this?\n\nAn Illinois man who received 21 of them sued Pelosi for $31,500, accusing her of violating anti-robocalling laws. \n\nHer campaign paid him a $7,500 settlement, according to new FEC filings.\n\nhttps://t.co/8I0Jgvesw8\u201d</div> — bryan metzger (@bryan metzger)
        <a href="https://twitter.com/metzgov/status/1647991226619121664">1681746701</a>
</blockquote>

<p>Another doozy of a text was hilariously long and detailed Pelosi's threatened speakership role: </p><p><em>"It's Nancy Pelosi. I don't usually send you texts this long, but this is dire. Three reports just revealed Dems' Majority is in critical danger. I need you to read my entire message, then rush $13 before tonight's End of Month Deadline to keep Republicans from EVER holding power again. I can’t overstate the urgency. Trump threatened to run for President if Rs FLIP my Majority -And they just outraised us by nearly $10M to do it. Unless we outraise Republicans & close my budget gap, we’ll have no chance to protect our Majority. Can you help? I’m speechless. -Rs just added FIVE seats to their list of expected wins. And they only need to flip FIVE seats to take our Majority. I need MASSIVE backlash -- 1K gifts before midnight -- to PROTECT our Democratic Majority. Will you rush $13?"</em></p><p>And the text actually kept going even longer, but out of sympathy for my readers, I decided to cut it short. So you're welcome. It seems Nance was a little panicked, no? </p><p>At least this issue is something most Americans can *probably* get behind. The opening line of the lawsuit reads, "As the Supreme Court has explained, Americans passionately disagree about many things. But they are largely united in their disdain for robocalls." And I don't know <em>anyone</em> who wouldn't want $7,500 in damages for such a bombardment of texts. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

She just couldn't leave this dude alone. Last October, Jorge Rojas filed a 13-page lawsuit against Pelosi's campaign and the Democratic fundraising platform ActBlue for violating the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, a law against robocalling. He initially sought damages of $1500 per text, totaling to $31,500. After receiving a $7,500 payout, however, he moved to dismiss the suit. </p><p>Rojas received a whopping 21 texts soliciting money between November 2021 and July 2022 even after he placed himself on the Do Not Call registry. The lawsuit includes the full text of some of the fundraising texts and reveals several of the appeals were sent *immediately* after the overturn of Roe vs. Wade. </p><p><em>"It's Nancy Pelosi - my heart is racing. The Supreme Court has officially voted to overturn Roe v. Wade. I need a historic response to meet this earth-shattering moment - 25,000 Democratic gifts in the next 24 hours - to replace every last anti-choice Republican who made this happen."</em>  Wonder how that went for her. </p><p>The lawsuit noted several texts contained images of Pelosi, and this Insider reporter kindly shared a screenshot from his own phone of what such a text looks like. It seems like it would definitely warrant a $30k lawsuit. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cNEW \u2014 have you ever received a Pelosi fundraising text like this?\n\nAn Illinois man who received 21 of them sued Pelosi for $31,500, accusing her of violating anti-robocalling laws. \n\nHer campaign paid him a $7,500 settlement, according to new FEC filings.\n\nhttps://t.co/8I0Jgvesw8\u201d</div> — bryan metzger (@bryan metzger)

<p>Another doozy of a text was hilariously long and detailed Pelosi's threatened speakership role: </p><p><em>"It's Nancy Pelosi. I don't usually send you texts this long, but this is dire. Three reports just revealed Dems' Majority is in critical danger. I need you to read my entire message, then rush $13 before tonight's End of Month Deadline to keep Republicans from EVER holding power again. I can’t overstate the urgency. Trump threatened to run for President if Rs FLIP my Majority -And they just outraised us by nearly $10M to do it. Unless we outraise Republicans & close my budget gap, we’ll have no chance to protect our Majority. Can you help? I’m speechless. -Rs just added FIVE seats to their list of expected wins. And they only need to flip FIVE seats to take our Majority. I need MASSIVE backlash -- 1K gifts before midnight -- to PROTECT our Democratic Majority. Will you rush $13?"</em></p><p>And the text actually kept going even longer, but out of sympathy for my readers, I decided to cut it short. So you're welcome. It seems Nance was a little panicked, no? </p><p>At least this issue is something most Americans can *probably* get behind. The opening line of the lawsuit reads, "As the Supreme Court has explained, Americans passionately disagree about many things. But they are largely united in their disdain for robocalls." And I don't know <em>anyone</em> who wouldn't want $7,500 in damages for such a bombardment of texts. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

But they did cover the minimal <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/donald-trump-sues-hillary" target="_blank">Russian</a> interference in the 2016 election, and made it seem less-than-minimal. </p><p>One claims,<em> "</em><em>Russia had clearly manipulated the cacophonous social media environment to exploit and amplify political divisions in order to disrupt the American electoral process.

<p>One of the books actually goes all the way through to Biden and has some doozies in it. It claims COVID likely started in a wet market and that a policeman died on January 6th.

## Tr​udeau whines after Musk slaps CBC with 'government-funded' label, so Elon trolls them with sexual innuendo

First, he changed the way <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/npr-twitter-label" target="_blank">NPR </a>is classified on Twitter to accurately reflect its alliance with the U.S. government. Then he <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-bbc-reporter" target="_blank">completely dismantled a BBC reporter's</a> claims about hate speech. Now, he's going after CANADIAN state media after complaints from the network and Justin Trudeau. The man cannot be stopped.</p><p>Trudeau was upset because Musk changed the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's [CBC] classification to reflect its reliance on government funding - much like he did with NPR. Trudeau whined that CBC is *only* 70 percent government funded, and that 30 percent of their funding comes from other revenue sources. The network receives about $1.2B in taxpayer dollars every year, mind you. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p><em>"I think it says a lot about the Conservative Party of Canada. They’re choosing to constantly attack independent media organizations, journalists who are working hard to keep Canadians informed and support our democracy." </em></p><p>I don't understand how in the world a corporation with 70% of its funding coming from the government to be considered "independent". Or how hunting down and freezing the bank accounts of the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/justin-trudeau-martial-law" target="_blank">Freedom Convoy</a> protestors can occur in a "democracy". But I digress. </p><p>CBC was quite angry as well, even refusing to use Twitter over the label. So Musk asked if CBC would be okay with a label of "70% government funded". Then he applied the label and said "their concern has been addressed". </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>But the story doesn't end there. Oh no. A Twitter user told Musk it might be better to label the network 69% government funded - just to give them the benefit of the doubt, y'know. Why not add a 1% cushion. Musk thought this was a great idea, since "generosity is always the right move".  And thus the CBC account now says, "69% government funded".</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>Just some more top-tier trolling from Musk. It's refreshing to see someone in charge who doesn't take everything so seriously. There's been no response yet, but I highly doubt CBC and Trudeau find this *quite* as amusing. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

<p>As is customary, fights started by girls need to be finished by men. Eventually, the dudes started throwing punches as well.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>The fight ended when security...security? SECURITY?!</p><p>One of the security guards must have been the one filming the video. I'm sure that was the reason no one showed up to break up a two-minute-long fight in the stands.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

Unless you came directly to the site or clicked the link in this morning's email blast, it most likely WILL NOT find you on your Facebook timeline. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-bbc-reporter" target="_blank">Elon Musk</a> sh*t on <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mark-zuckerberg-awesome-wonderful-man" target="_blank">Mark Zuckerberg</a> and Facebook.</p><p>Specifically, Facebook being fair and even-handed when it comes to allowing users to voice political opinions and NOT favor one ideology over the other. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tucker-carlson-ufos-full-send" target="_blank">Tucker Carlson</a> asked why Facebook can't be more like Twitter in that regard. Elon laughed in his face.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rumble">

<blockquote>"My understanding is that Zuckerberg spent 400 million dollars in the last election in a "get out the vote" campaign, but really in support of democrats. Is that accurate or not accurate? Does that sound unbiased to you?</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>It's all about Zuckerface's algorithm. Something as people who hustle political content for a living we know firsthand. You see the difference in traffic from, say, email blasts where we know you're seeing the content. Versus on Facebook where I don't even see our content on my own timeline.</p><p>The issue was more pronounced compared to Parler (RIP) at its peak. You would share articles either critical of Biden or positive about various GOP officials, and the traffic we would get from Parler would rival that of Facebook, with only a sixth of the potential audience. </p><p>As long as Facebook keeps its thumb on the scale and/or uses partisan non-profits they have deemed "independent" "fact" checkers as an excuse to throttle content they don't like, there IS NO fair or even-handed coverage of political content. It's the way Zuckerberg wants it.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

After translager Bud Light made the unfortunate decision to prioritize a temporary ESG boost over their customers, there have been calls for boycotts. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-brantley-gilbert" target="_blank">Cans are being spiked like footballs</a>. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kid-rock-bud-light" target="_blank">Twelve packs are getting Swiss cheese'd up</a>. Coors is making sure <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-staffer-under-bus" target="_blank">they monitor their low-level marketing staffers</a> to prevent this from happening to them. It's chaos out on these streets.</p><p>For their contribution to the culture war, Team DeSantis has offered up a parody of a classic Bud Light commercial saluting the real men of genius...who have rigged the system in women's sports.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">In Florida, girls play girls’ sports and boys play boys’ sports. <br /><br />That’s why we are replacing Bud Light with FREEDOM HEAVY 🍻🐊 … made 100% woke-free. <a href="https://t.co/UD39AQnAui">pic.twitter.com/UD39AQnAui</a><br />— DeSantis War Room 🐊 (@DeSantisWarRoom) <a href="https://twitter.com/DeSantisWarRoom/status/1648126878207680513?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 18, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>Today, we recognize the men who have hacked the system. Once mediocre in the men's division, now the cream of the crop in the women's. You couldn't cut it with the boys, so you pished women off the podium.  Because without you, sports would be fair. Without you, women's sports would be for...well, women.</blockquote><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>All of our favorites are there. Smasher of orbital bones <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/fallon-fox-brags-terf" target="_blank">Fallon Fox</a>. Laurel Hubbard, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/laurel-hubbard-weightlifter-winner-response" target="_blank">who shattered the glass ceiling becoming the first transwoman to choke in the Olympics</a>. NCAA swimming champion Lia Thomas who while now a woman <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lia-thomas-riley-gaines" target="_blank">was born male, went through puberty as a male, still has male genitalia, and still dates women</a> just like those who were born male and went through puberty as males with male genitalia have been traditionally known to do.</p><p>I can tell some of you youngbloods are confused right now. This is what Bud Light ads used to be:</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

</p>
<p>Of course, the GOP establishment is starting to cave on the boycott. Governor Ron DeSantis, instead, is doubling down and explaining why the boycott matters. </p><blockquote>The companies that do this, if they don't have any response, they're just going to keep doing it. ... We have the power as consumers to make our voices heard. And not on every company because sometimes conservative consumers aren't going to make a dent in some companies. [Bud Light] is one, if you don't have conservative beer drinkers, you're going to feel that.</blockquote><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">EXCLUSIVE: Gov. DeSantis On Bud Light Boycott:<br /><br />"Why would you want to drink Bud Light?<br /><br />If we don't push back they're gonna keep doing it.
