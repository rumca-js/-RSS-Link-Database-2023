Starting with both Dave Filoni and James Mangold set to direct two separate upcoming Star Wars films. Detailing what we can expect further from each director, Filoni\u2019s movie will apparently close out the New Republic, tying up the stories told within the Disney Plus shows, The Mandalorian, The Book of Boba Fett, and the upcoming Ahsoka series. For Filoni, this\u2019ll be a great way for the interconnected stories we\u2019ve seen play out on the Disney Plus live-action offerings with Mandalorian, Book of Boba Fett, and soon Ashoka, to tie up any loose ends left on the small screen, and potentially bring these characters together for a galactic battle fit for theaters. That\u2019s a tall order, but if anyone\u2019s up to the task, it\u2019s Dave Filoni, who was a proteg\u00e9 of George Lucas\u2019 prior to the Disney era of #StarWars.
