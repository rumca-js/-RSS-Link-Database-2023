There's yet another scam technique going around, and this time it's a new twist on the channel hijacking scam that has been targeting YouTubers. The victim will receive an email saying that they must accept some new monetization terms, but ends up linking to a virus download. But the tricky thing is that the email actually comes from the real YouTube.com domain. The scammer uses the private video sharing feature to spoof the subject line and make it look like an official announcement. Then the video they link to is an AI deepfake of the CEO of Google talking about the same scam. And of course, when they download the file, it steals their cookies and hijacks their channel.
