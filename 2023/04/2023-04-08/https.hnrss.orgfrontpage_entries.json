We just shipped a full-featured TUI (Text User Interface) for chatting with your Marvin bots, powered by GPT 4 or GPT-3.5. Like all of Marvin, it's fully open-source and we hope you find it useful. To launch it, upgrade and run `marvin chat`.<p>The TUI is built with Textual (<a href=\"https://github.com/textualize/textual/\">https://github.com/textualize/textual/</a>) and uses some of its newest features including background workers and modals. We've made base TUIs before but this is the first one that's a true \"app\" with many screens and coordinated global state. Happy to answer any questions about working with Textual - once it \"clicked\" it was surprisingly similar to building a traditional front end! Small note: Terminal.app on MacOS isn't great for TUIs, so while it'll work, we suggest an alternative terminal.<p>One of our goals with the TUI was to integrate Marvin's bots into the familiar chat UX. Bots can have distinct personalities, instructions, and use plugins, so each one is like a mini \"conversational application.\" You might know about Marvin because of AI Functions, but at its core Marvin is a library for building and deploying bots (in fact, AI functions are actually a bot!). We started building the TUI as a way to quickly explore and assess our bots' capabilities. It quickly became so useful that we decided to make it a first-class experience.<p>We've preloaded several bots, including one that can guide you through an RPG and another that is obsessed with explaining regex, and will add many more. You can even create your own bots just by asking the default bot (Marvin) to help you.<p>We hope the TUI is a fun way to quickly interact with your bots and it was a great way for us to learn Textual. Please check out the code and let us know what enhancements we can add!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35496558\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35496558</a></p>\n<p>Points: 30</p>\n<p># Comments: 3</p>", "link": "https://www.askmarvin.ai/guide/concepts/tui/", "date_published": "2023-04-08 19:10:11+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Dad says glitch in \u2018Find My iPhone\u2019 app directs angry strangers to his home", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2023/04/06/find-my-iphone-app-glitch-sends-strangers-to-mans-home/\">https://nypost.com/2023/04/06/find-my-iphone-app-glitch-sends-strangers-to-mans-home/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35496365\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35496365</a></p>\n<p>Points: 14</p>\n<p># Comments: 7</p>", "link": "https://nypost.com/2023/04/06/find-my-iphone-app-glitch-sends-strangers-to-mans-home/", "date_published": "2023-04-08 18:49:36+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Ask HN: Tell me about how you bombed a technical interview", "description": "<p>Context: I was just listening to the latest Soft Skills Engineering[1] (a podcast I highly recommend, by the way!) and they were consoling a junior eng who bombed an interview by saying everyone has a story about doing this at some point. I thought it'd be nice to crowd-source these stories in case others are feeling bad about their interview experiences :)<p>I can start: My first tech interview ever was the summer going into my Junior year of college. I was still very raw and had no idea what to expect, and got asked a pretty standard string manipulation question. I fumbled around for a while before frantically trying to Google the question in a manner that I now realize was likely very obvious. Needless to say, I didn't get the job. I did learn from the experience, though, and studied my butt off for the next summer, which paid off in much harder interviews :)<p>Looking forward to hearing yours, thanks!<p>[1]

to radically accelerate the pace of software development for every company in the world. We're starting with a tool to catch UI bugs in web applications with zero-effort from developers.<p>How it works: Insert a single line of JavaScript onto your site, and we record thousands of real user sessions. We then replay these sessions on head and base commits of PRs, take screenshots at key points, and diff those screenshots to catch visual regressions before they hit production. We employ novel techniques to eliminate flakes. You can watch a 60-second demo at [meticulous.ai](<a href=\"http://meticulous.ai/\">http://meticulous.ai/</a>).<p>We are a London-based YC company. Our engineering team previously worked at Dropbox, Opendoor, Palantir and Google, and have previously led 100+ engineer organizations at these companies. We raised $4m and are backed by some of the best founders and technical leaders in Silicon Valley, including Guillermo Rauch (founder Vercel, author next.js), Jason Warner (CTO GitHub), Scott Belsky (CPO Adobe), Calvin French-Owen (founder Segment), Jared Friedman (YC partner and former CTO of Scribd) and a bunch of other incredible folks.<p>Catching visual regressions is just the start. There is an entire category of products to build on top of replay. This ranges from catching exceptions to revealing the performance impact of frontend code.<p>We want to change the way the world develops software, and influence software approaches for decades to come.<p>We are seeding a London office and hiring an onsite founding engineer to join our team of four. We sponsor visas.<p>You will have autonomy in building out this technology, but here are a few problems you might work on:<p>- Build a distributed system to concurrently replay thousands of sessions, such that a developer gets a result in seconds.<p>- Speed up the replay of sessions in a way that retains determinism.<p>- Derive algorithms to detect sessions that cover differing code paths and edge cases, and ignore sessions that are too similar.<p>- Help build out a team of world-class, highly collaborative, software engineers.<p>As founding engineer, you get to shape the company, and build the culture and technology from the ground up.<p>What we look for:<p>In a sentence: Technically brilliant, delightful to work with, combined with a self-awareness and strong desire to improve. We also want to make sure everyone is highly supportive of each other; we win as a team.<p>We're currently only looking to bring on folks with senior level skill sets and 5+ years of industry experience. You should have strong web fundamentals and a deep love for software engineering. Maybe you enjoy programming books like Clean Code, Designing Data Intensive Applications, Pragmatic Programmer etc. or enjoy hacking on interesting side projects. You value transparency and candid feedback, and are motivated by a strong desire to become the best engineer you can be.<p>You can read about our values here <a href=\"https://ruby-wish-a8f.notion.site/Mission-Values-979c32ec58e74856af02da2e59c9f64d\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://ruby-wish-a8f.notion.site/Mission-Values-979c32ec58e...</a><p>You will be given the space and time to up-level yourself as an engineer in terms of conferences, reading, or whatever you think will be most valuable. We will also set you up with mentorship, if you desire it, from top engineering leaders (folks running 100-engineer organizations at the world's leading tech companies).<p>You\u2019ll get to work alongside some of the best engineers there are, break new ground solving truly novel CS problems and deliver something that transforms how software is built.<p>If this sounds interesting, please reach out to me at gabe [at] meticulous [dot] ai with \u201cHN\u201d in the subject line and 2-3 sentences about what you find interesting about Meticulous and your resume/LinkedIn/GitHub.</p>\n<hr
