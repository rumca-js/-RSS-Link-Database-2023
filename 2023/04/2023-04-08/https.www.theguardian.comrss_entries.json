The real challenge for our memory (and intelligence) is to correlate things that aren\u2019t ordinarily thought of together. For example: my dog, Leah, is a Schipperke, which is a hard word to remember. Solution? Imagine a tiny boat (representing a tiny dog) with a huge portly captain \u2013 the skipper \u2013 standing in it while holding a key, skipper key.

All mention of the massacre was taboo in the Soviet Union. Compelled by conscience, Shostakovich wanted to break that silence and address the issue of antisemitism. He set controversial texts by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/02/yevgeny-yevtushenko-obituary\">Yevgeny Yevtushenko</a>: Babi Yar, and four other poems on aspects of daily Soviet life.
