## Dave Filoni Star Wars Movie Announced, New Sequel Movie Confirmed - IGN The Fix: Entertainment

Weâ€™ve got a ton of Star Wars news to break down, with new details emerging on new entries into the franchise thatâ€™s not too far, far away. Starting with both Dave Filoni and James Mangold set to direct two separate upcoming Star Wars films. Detailing what we can expect further from each director, Filoniâ€™s movie will apparently close out the New Republic, tying up the stories told within the Disney Plus shows, The Mandalorian, The Book of Boba Fett, and the upcoming Ahsoka series. For Filoni, thisâ€™ll be a great way for the interconnected stories weâ€™ve seen play out on the Disney Plus live-action offerings with Mandalorian, Book of Boba Fett, and soon Ashoka, to tie up any loose ends left on the small screen, and potentially bring these characters together for a galactic battle fit for theaters. Thatâ€™s a tall order, but if anyoneâ€™s up to the task, itâ€™s Dave Filoni, who was a protegÃ© of George Lucasâ€™ prior to the Disney era of #StarWars. And finally, John Leguzamo has no plans to see the Super Mario Bros. movie.
