Patan patola saris range from $1,500 to $8,500. Instead of designs being embroidered onto the textile, Patan patola requires them to be dyed onto the silk threads themselves. Both horizontal and vertical threads are dyed, then cross-woven to reveal the design. The most complex designs can take one and a half years of manual work to complete.
