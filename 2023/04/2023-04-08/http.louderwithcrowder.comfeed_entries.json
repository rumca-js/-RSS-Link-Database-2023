Riley and the other competitors, according to science, were all women. Lia, according to the AP Styleguide, was also a woman. Albeit, a woman who was born male, went through puberty as a male, <a href=\"https://meaww.com/lia-thomas-women-uncomfortable-changing-in-locker-room-with-trans-u-penn-swimmer\" target=\"_blank\">still has male genitalia, and still dates women</a> just like those who were born male and went through puberty as males with male genitalia have been traditionally known to do.<br /></p><p>There are critics who believe transgender athletes like Lia being born a male gives them unfair genetic advantages over the biologically female collegiate swimmers.

Contestants from RuPaul's Drag Race are expected to be there. The tweet from the Los Angeles LGBT Center that announced the march cited \"over 400 pieces of anti-LGBTQ legislation on the books\". Which makes it sound like states are outlawing homosexuality. But they're actually banning adults from grooming children. Po-tay-to, po-tah-to. </p><p>The event is sponsored by over 40 pro-LGBTQ organizations, and several of them are faith-based , including the pro-LGBTQ church All Saints Los Angeles, and Founders Metropolitan Community Church, which is a self-described \"progressive community of faith.\" All Saints also has an upcoming <a href=\"https://www.allsaintsla.church/events-1/drag-me-to-church\" target=\"_blank\">\"Drag Me to Brunch\"</a> event scheduled, featuring a drag show, brunch, and bottomless mimosas. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cThis year alone, there are over 400 pieces of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation on the books. \\nOn Easter Sunday (April 9th), we\\u2019ll gather in our Sunday Best to show the world what we\\u2019re made of\\u2014and that we\\u2019re not going back. \\n\\nRSVP NOW https://t.co/6dc8e2vtl5\\u201d</div> \u2014 Los Angeles LGBT Center (@Los Angeles LGBT Center)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LALGBTCenter/status/1643631418717683712\">1680707242</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Joe Hollendonor, the CEO of the LA LGBT Center, said in a statement to Variety:<em> \"It is no mistake that today\u2019s \u2018Drag Bans\u2019 are accompanied by a sweeping movement to ban access to gender-affirming care; we are fighting for our right to privacy, bodily autonomy, self-determination, and freedom of expression.\" </em></p><p>I feel like one could have privacy, bodily autonomy, self-determination, and freedom of expression <em>without </em>mutilating children or subjecting them to age-inappropriate, sexually explicit \"entertainment\" shows.

It's quite a random appearance. And to my knowledge, she isn't an actress. So was her only qualification her love for Baby Yoda...?</p><p>One other reason for the show's abysmal reviews could be the lack of Gina Carano. Current season three is the first without her appearance as the beloved character Cara Dune. If you recall, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/show-notes-february-11\" target=\"_blank\">Disney fired Gina back in 2021</a> for the crime of COVID wrong-think.
