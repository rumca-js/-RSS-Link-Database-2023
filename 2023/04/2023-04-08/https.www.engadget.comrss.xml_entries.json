As of Saturday, the company now lists the public broadcaster as a \u201cgovernment funded\u201d organization. <em>NPR </em>tech reporter Bobby Allyn was the first to report on the change. He said Elon Musk told him Twitter would apply the \u201cgovernment funded\u201d designation to other institutions in the coming days. \u201cTesla, which has received billions of dollars in government subsidies over the years, does not appear to have the label,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BobbyAllyn/status/1644779914053435392?s=20\"><ins>Allyn added</ins></a>.</p><div id=\"afb3214c0d114560ae015eda07481399\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">NEW: Label on NPR\u2019s main account changed to \u201cgovernment funded,\u201d and Elon tells me Twitter is \u201capplying it to a larger number of institutions.\u201d</p>\u2014 Bobby Allyn (@BobbyAllyn) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BobbyAllyn/status/1644778760334610432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 8, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>The main NPR account has not tweeted since Twitter first applied the state-affiliated label on Wednesday. After NPR CEO John Lansing issued a statement pointing out that the \u201cstate-affiliate\u201d did not apply to the public broadcaster under Twitter\u2019s own guidelines, the company <a href=\"https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/state-affiliated\">changed those guidelines</a>. &quot;State-financed media organizations with editorial independence, like the BBC in the UK or NPR in the US for example, are not defined as state-affiliated media,&quot; the page said before Tuesday. By Wednesday, the company had removed the section of text that had referenced NPR. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/about-npr/178660742/public-radio-finances\"><ins>According to NPR</ins></a>, less than one percent of its annual operating budget comes from government grants.
