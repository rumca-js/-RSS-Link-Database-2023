## A historic appointment of a woman as CEO may be just what the AFL needs | Megan Maurice

<p>Sport is no longer the domain of traditional masculinity and leaders who fail to recognise this are likely to find their sport floundering</p><p>Perusing the list of former chief executive officers of the AFL does not make for a particularly diverse reading experience. Only 13 people have held the role since its inception – when it was called VFL president – in 1897. All 13 have been white men – with an average age of 49 years on beginning the role. Many have been privately educated and played football at a high level. The list is a living embodiment of the oft-uttered phrase in long-established organisations: “That’s the way we’ve always done things.”</p><p>Few would be surprised that it is such a homogenous list. The role of the AFL CEO is one of the most important in Australian sport, and it appears heavily guarded from those who do not fit the traditional view of what a sporting CEO might look like. The role’s salary is no longer publicly disclosed, but was last declared at $1.74m in 2017. It is one of the most highly sought after jobs in the country.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/apr/16/a-historic-appointment-of-a-woman-as-ceo-may-be-just-what-the-afl-needs">Continue reading...</a>

Brentford have no such worries but their European hopes continue to fade after a damaging defeat. They remain ninth but are four points behind Brighton having played two games more.

<p>The NBA postseason (proper) tips off Saturday with the field of 16 fixed. Here’s what to watch for if you’re only just tuning in</p><p>Much has been made of the toll that 82 games can take on the human body over the course of an NBA season, as it pertains to the players in those games and their ability to stay healthy enough to participate in most (let alone <em>all</em>) of them. But even for fans of the sport, 82 can be a lot of games to keep up with. As we find ourselves, once again, at the best time of the year – the NBA playoffs – it’s understandable to feel a little scrambled about what it is we’re looking at. So, here’s a primer of sorts. A CliffsNotes, if you will, for all of the first-round matchups: what to expect, what to be excited about, and what to look out for.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/apr/15/nba-playoff-preview-first-round-analysis">Continue reading...</a>

## Dan James caps Fulham stroll as danger looms large for tawdry Everton

<p>Everton had stirred under Sean Dyche, raising the prospect of a second successive escape from relegation, but Goodison Park was shaken by the grim realisation the Championship may be beckoning after all. Fulham prospered from a shambolic home display to leave Everton hovering precariously above the drop zone with three home games to play.</p><p>Without the suspended Aleksandar Mitrovic and with banned manager Marco Silva watching from the directors’ box, Fulham ended a run of five consecutive defeats in all competitions in clinical, comprehensive style. Harrison Reed, Harry Wilson and Dan James made light of the Serb centre-forward’s absence to score with ease against a frequently exposed Jordan Pickford. Everton, manager and players alike, were clueless as to how to stem the flow of white shirts slicing them to pieces. With Newcastle and Manchester City among the final three visitors to Goodison, and still no sign of Dominic Calvert-Lewin despite his return to first-team training, this was a must-win fixture for Dyche’s team. They blew up spectacularly.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/15/everton-fulham-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘THE WITCH IS DEAD’: disgraced Daniel Snyder finally exits the stage

<p>Dan Snyder’s record $6.05bn sale of the Washington Commanders will mark the end of a 24-year tenure defined by scandal, dysfunction and ineptitude</p><p>The long national nightmare could soon be over. NFL fans in and around the nation’s capital haven’t stopped buzzing since word spread this week that Washington Commanders owner Daniel Snyder <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/apr/13/washington-commanders-sale-daniel-snyder-josh-harris-group">had agreed to sell</a> the storied NFL franchise. With that hurdle cleared, it’s now down to the league’s 31 other team owners to rubber stamp the record $6.05bn deal. The rumored purchase price would exceed the guestimate Forbes came up with earlier this year for the Dallas Cowboys, ostensibly the world’s most valuable sports franchise, as well as the record $4.65bn cost of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jun/08/denver-broncos-record-sale-walmart-family">recently sold</a> Denver Broncos.</p><p>Never mind that the 58-year-old Snyder, one of the great sports villains of the last quarter-century, makes off like a bandit in the exchange. The news of his imminent departure has landed like Dorothy’s farmhouse in the Land of Oz. “DING DONG THE WITCH IS DEAD,” <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/DickyCharleston/status/1646561608464728080?cxt=HHwWoICw1ePD4dktAAAA">tweeted</a> one Commanders fan. Another, speaking to radio station <a href="https://wtop.com/washington-commanders/2023/04/fans-react-to-dan-snyders-pending-sale-of-the-commanders/">WTOP</a>, likened the breakup to a “bad marriage/relationship for 20-something years, then you finally get that divorce and find a hotter, young lady that comes and puts a smile on your face.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/apr/15/daniel-snyder-washington-commanders-sale">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Empire Polo Ground, Indio, California</strong></p><p>Despite some audio issues with special guest Post Malone, the Puerto Rican star put on a dazzling show as the festival’s first Spanish-language headliner</p><p>“I want to know something before I keep going with my show,” said Bad Bunny in English three songs into a swaggering, shape-shifting two-hour headliner set at Coachella late on Friday night. “What do you prefer: me talking in English or hablando español?” The biggest artist in the world – the most streamed for <a href="https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/with-18bn-streams-in-2022-bad-bunny-is-spotifys-most-streamed-artist-globally-for-the-third-year1/#:~:text=With%20more%20than%2018.5bn,straight%20year%20%2D%20Music%20Business%20Worldwide">three years running</a>, with the top album (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/06/bad-bunny-un-verano-sin-ti-album-review">Un Verano Sin Ti</a>) and highest grossing tour in 2022 – is not known for speaking English. His voraciously genre-absorbing music remains in rapid-fire Puerto Rican Spanish; his refusal to cater to English-only audiences in mainstream crossover is a longstanding political point. And so it was not a hard question for the sprawling crowd at Coachella, many of whom knew every one of lyrics: an emphatic “ESPAÑOL!”</p><p>The dazzling statement show Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, better known as the Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny, put on into early Saturday morning was, for his fans, a triumphant victory lap; for those who don’t speak Spanish or aren’t familiar with the ascendant world of Latin music, an education; for everyone, a bumping dance party from start to finish. The lane-switching, or braiding, was seamless, even when it wasn’t – fitting for an artist who sounds relaxed even when he’s tearing through a line or doing calisthenics on stage. In person, his baritone sounds even more vaguely underwater, magnetic and rich.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/15/bad-bunny-coachella-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Professional tips from a carpenter, a plumber, a stylist, a garden designer and more</p><p>White skirting shows marks and scuffs. Instead, paint walls and woodwork the same colour, even ceilings if you’re feeling bold. With enough light it gives the room a rich depth, with fewer lines and edges breaking up the space, making for a more streamlined look. This creates a cosy feel in smaller areas, and with no contrasts to distract the eye, it creates a connected look in larger spaces. It can also emphasise the architectural detailing of a room and allow furnishings, pictures and decorative items to sing. We paint the walls in an emulsion and woodwork in an eggshell or a satin finish.<br /><em>Painter </em><em>Sarah Cockings;</em><em> </em><em><a href="http://www.purebrilliantpainting.com/" title="">purebrilliantpainting.com</a></em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/15/buff-taps-rehang-doors-experts-diy-advice">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With new furniture losing its shine and more online marketplaces, there’s never been a better time to buy secondhand</p><p>There was a time when finding the perfect vintage chair was an insider’s art – something only for those with a keen eye and the time to scour flea markets and auction rooms. But today there’s a huge online market for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/16/the-secondhand-home-15-ways-to-find-the-vintage-furniture-of-your-dreams" title="">vintage furniture</a> and homeware, much of it sold by small independents who have access to a global audience via Instagram and social media. Buying secondhand is better for the planet; it’s easier and less stressful than shopping at Ikea; and it’s a more creative – and often more affordable – way to furnish our homes. We all know about the environmental impact of overproduction in the fashion industry, and the lessons are the same when it comes to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/homes" title="">furniture</a> and interiors, too.</p><p>While previous generations furnished their homes with tables and chairs made from quality wood that will outlive them – Victorian pine, 20s oak, 60s teak – we have become used to MDF chests of drawers that fall apart after a few years.

<p>The high street is full of perfumes well under the £100 mark that massively overdeliver </p><p>I’m not sure how and when so many perfumes sailed blithely past the £100-a-bottle threshold, but the rising cost of ingredients is, I believe, more excuse than explanation. Only last week, some fragrance-writer friends and I were moaning about a decidedly average perfume that had landed on our desks with a particularly audacious price tag of £230. Conversely, I’ve rarely had so many enthusiastic messages from Saturday readers as when I recently wrote a column on more affordable fragrances – and I’m told my recommendations sold out. So here we are again, this time with an eye on spring scents.</p><p>If you haven’t sniffed out <strong>Marks </strong><strong>&amp; Spencer</strong>’s own-brand fragrances, remedy this at once. Its current offering is way better than it could get away with. There’s been much fuss on TikTok about its (admittedly good) Discover collection of designer doppelganger fragrances, but to focus on the dupes (I’m unkeen on principle) is to miss out on its much more imaginative Provenance and Apothecary lines.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/apr/15/its-spring-and-im-on-the-scent-of-gorgeous-affordable-fragrances">Continue reading...</a>
