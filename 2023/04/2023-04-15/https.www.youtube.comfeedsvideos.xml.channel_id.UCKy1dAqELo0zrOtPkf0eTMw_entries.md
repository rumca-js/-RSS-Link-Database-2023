The Mandalorian Season 3 is navigating some interesting chapters of Star Wars. Grogu, The Mandalorian, Thrawn, and maybe some other familiar names may soon face off! Will the Mandalorian himself (Pedro Pascal) and Baby Yoda be able to walk away unscathed? Star Wars’ The Mandalorian on Disney Plus is spending a lot of time with Bo Katan leading many to believe in The Mandalorian S3, she is the titular “The Mandalorian.” Moff Gideon is laying down the stakes and Pedro Pascal’s The Mandalorian character is suddenly out of play and the future for The Mandalorian and Grogu can’t be predicted.

We’ve been following the story of the Mandalorian and “Baby Yoda,” and the Darksaber for quite a while now. Has the Darksaber found its rightful master finally? The Star Wars Darksaber has deep roots, and as IGN and Max Scoville can tell you in this episode of Canon Fodder, Moff Gideon has a big role to play. We know the circumstances of the Moff Gideon Escape, but we’re breaking down the NEW Moff Gideon Armor and why it’s so controversial. Plus, Imperial Supercommandos return?! We’ll see if Imperial Mandalorians are any match for the more traditional kind and that sneaky Mythosaur!

Amid all the announcements at Star Wars Celebration 2023, few were as surprising or welcome as the news that The Mandalorian’s Dave Filoni is directing a live-action Star Wars movie. Filoni is overseeing a film set after the events of Return of the Jedi, and one that ties together characters from Disney+ series like The Mandalorian, The Book of Boba Fett and Ahsoka. It’s the big team-up we’ve all been waiting for.

Lucasfilm hasn’t given a name or release date for this new movie, but we may be able to solve one of those mysteries. Could Filoni’s film be called Star Wars: Heir to the Empire? Is this blockbuster set to adapt one of the most iconic Expanded Universe stories of all time? Let’s take a deep dive into Heir to the Empire and why it’s probably going to have a lot of influence over the new movie.
