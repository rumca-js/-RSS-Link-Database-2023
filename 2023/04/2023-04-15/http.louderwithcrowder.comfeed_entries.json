Spoiler: they refused him services. Since dogs can't consent and all that. Plus, it's ridiculous. </p><p>The man brought his male French bulldog, donning a pink tutu, to a vet. He explains to the workers that while his dog is in fact a male, every time he puts a tutu in front of the dog, the dog immediately puts it on. And therefore, the dog is actually a female and requires a <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jazz-jennings-themselves\" target=\"_blank\">gender transition</a> operation. </p><p>\"We want to do a gender transition to make him female. But we don't want to neuter him.\"</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cViral video of man taking dog for \"gender transition\" proves how disgusting and wrong child sex changes are\\n\\nhttps://t.co/fnnqZ9dbEx\\u201d</div> \u2014 The Post Millennial (@The Post Millennial)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TPostMillennial/status/1646957794162102277\">1681500311</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The male worker says they don't offer sex change operations at the clinic, and told them to \"go somewhere with a specialist\". The female worker explains the vet is not a \"behavioral health clinic\". The man responds, \"I wouldn\u2019t call that behavioral. You\u2019re saying gender identity is behavioral?\u201d And the woman immediately backpedals. </p><p>The dog and owner are then asked to leave, and he says he will report the incident \"to the LGBTQ+ minus 2 Association of America.\" </p><p>While children are clearly not equal to dogs (no matter how much those \"dog moms\" with strollers insist), this is still a decent analogy. Children obviously have infinitely more reason than animals. But they cannot consent to things like permanent sex-change operations since their brains are not yet fully formed, and they don't have a clear understanding of the world. Because they're <em>children</em>. </p><p>Children believe in a jolly old man who comes down their chimney to leave presents and a giant bunny that leaves them eggs full of candy. They don't exactly have the logic stuff down pat yet, nor should they. But it's the responsibility of adults to help shape their view of the world, foster logic and reason, and protect them from lies - like those of the trans cult. As opposed to taking everything the child says as absolute truth. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Lily is a Zoomer college dropout who somehow landed a writing gig here at LwC.com.

Just like this British Gran who had some choice words for her granddaughter's new butterfly <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/pronouns-tattooed-eyes\" target=\"_blank\">tattoo</a>. Specifically, \"sh*t\". </p><p>The gal shows off her fresh ink in the video, a butterfly with one of its wings made up of flowers. If any of you ladies are Pinterest fiends like I am, you've likely seen this exact design somewhere on your feed.  The girl's older sister, who's filming the interaction, asks their <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/grandma-carjack-chemo\" target=\"_blank\">grandma</a> what she thinks of Izzy's tattoo. To which she replies, \"sh*t\" and calls it \"horrible\".</p><p>Izzy was not happy. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cShe did not hold back!\\ud83d\\ude2c\\nhttps://t.co/bS5wQRaRsm\\u201d</div> \u2014 Mirror Weird News (@Mirror Weird News)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MirrorWeirdNews/status/1646606934039207936\">1681416660</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Izzy asked, \"Do you know what else is horrible? I'm not going to say because I don't want to hurt your feelings like you just hurt mine.\" Grandma then tried to explain why she thought the new ink is the equivalent of feces, saying it's \"not finished off properly\" because \"it's only got two wings and a body.\" Izzy protested, but her Gran was referring to the flowers that replace the butterfly's other two wings: \"You could have them over that flower, it's stupid.\"</p><p>The sister then turned the camera to ask their mother what she thought, but Grandma was not finished yet, adding, \"It'll be an old moth soon anyway.\" </p><p>I can see how, if I were in the daughter's position, I may be a <em>tad</em> irritated and self-conscious of the new insect tattooed on my body. But you have to admit, this Grandma is pretty rad. The sister filming the interaction said her response was \"no surprise\" and \"she has no filter and says everything she thinks with no hesitation.\" Which I find quite refreshing. But Izzy clearly did not. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Lily is a Zoomer college dropout who somehow landed a writing gig here at LwC.com.

That, and clickbait articles cherry-picking a handful of \"conservatives\" criticizing James, complaining we are spending so much bandwidth on Dylan, and derpity derpy derp derp.</p><p>P.S.
