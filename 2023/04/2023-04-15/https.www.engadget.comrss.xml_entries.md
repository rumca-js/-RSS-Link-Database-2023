<p>Ahead of its April 19th release date, Sony and Guerrilla Games on Friday shared a new trailer for <em>Horizon Forbidden West: Burning Shores</em>. The DLC is set to tell the next chapter of Aloy’s story. The trailer offers a fresh look at the Burning Shores, a volcanic archipelago that was once home to Los Angeles. We also get a closer look at the Metal Devil boss fight that was teased at the end of the announcement trailer Sony and Guerrilla <a href="https://www.engadget.com/horizon-forbidden-west-dlc-burning-shores-ps-5-trailer-release-date-031454595.html"><ins>released last year</ins></a>.</p><div id="1653513d57a64dd48867b0823223f652"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>That battle is one of the reasons <em>Horizon Forbidden West:</em><em>Burning Shores </em>won’t be available on PlayStation 4, even though you can play the original game on Sony’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/horizon-forbidden-west-guerrilla-games-developer-interview-143036984.html"><ins>last generation console</ins></a>. “The cityscape ruins of LA and its surroundings are highly detailed and require a lot of processing power as well as fast streaming technology to run properly,” <a href="https://www.engadget.com/horizon-forbidden-west-review-water-robot-dinos-080126554.html"><em>Horizon Forbidden West</em></a> Game Director Mathijs de Jonge <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/03/14/ps5-creators-how-horizon-forbidden-west-burning-shores-will-harness-the-power-of-ps5/"><ins>told the PlayStation Blog last month</ins></a>.

<p>The Federal Aviation Administration has given SpaceX final regulatory approval to carry out Starship’s first orbital flight test. Per <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/04/green-light-go-spacex-receives-a-launch-license-from-the-faa-for-starship/"><em>Ars Technica</em></a>, the FAA on late Friday afternoon issued the company a license to launch its next-generation rocket from South Texas. “After a comprehensive license evaluation process, the FAA determined SpaceX met all safety, environmental, policy, payload, airspace integration and financial responsibility requirements,” the agency said in a statement. “The license is valid for five years.”</p><div id="90fff5de3e2d48cca9a3c6ee95dff66f"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Targeting as soon as Monday, April 17 for the first flight test of a fully integrated Starship and Super Heavy rocket from Starbase in Texas → <a href="https://t.co/bJFjLCiTbK">https://t.co/bJFjLCiTbK</a><a href="https://t.co/Ry25Uuvknh">pic.twitter.com/Ry25Uuvknh</a></p>— SpaceX (@SpaceX) <a href="https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/1646996041978507264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 14, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>As of Friday, SpaceX <a href="https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/1646996041978507264?s=20">said</a> it would attempt to carry out the long-awaited test on Monday morning, with the launch window opening at 7AM local time. <a href="https://twitter.com/SciGuySpace/status/1647075306094698499?s=20">Per <em>Ars Technica’s</em> Eric Berger</a>, the forecast for the Monday launch attempt looks ideal, with moderate winds and clear skies expected.

In addition to all the technical hurdles it has had to overcome, the FAA put the company’s Boca Chica facility through a comprehensive environmental assessment. Located near the Gulf of Mexico, the launch site is surrounded by wetlands that are home to <a href="https://whsrn.org/balancing-space-exploration-and-shorebird-conservation-in-boca-chica-texas/">hundreds of thousands of shorebirds</a>. Last June, the FAA gave SpaceX a list of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/scientists-have-successfully-engineered-bacteria-to-fight-cancer-in-mice-165141857.html">75 actions</a> it had to complete to protect the local wildlife around the facility. With those out of the way, now all the company needs to worry about are any remaining technical issues affecting Starship.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/faa-grants-spacex-approval-for-starship-orbital-flight-test-171345195.html?src=rss

<p>Apple’s forthcoming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-15-inch-macbook-air-12-inch-revival-170337389.html"><ins>15-inch MacBook Air</ins></a> will feature a processor “on par” with the company’s current M2 chip. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-14/apple-ramps-up-testing-of-new-macbooks-ahead-of-summer-launch?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a>, Apple recently began testing the laptop to ensure its compatibility with third-party App Store apps, something the company does in the lead-up to the release of a new device.</p><p>Developer logs shared with the outlet show the machine was configured with a chipset that featured an eight-core CPU and 10-core GPU, along with 8GB of RAM. Those specs suggest the 15-inch MacBook Air, referred to as “Mac 15,3” in the logs, will ship with an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-m2-chip-power-efficient-180201985.html">M2 chipset</a>, not Apple’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-and-apple-expected-to-debut-3-nm-processors-next-year-100632556.html">next-generation chip</a>, as some past reports had suggested. “Bigger changes to the Mac will come later with the release of an M3 chip,” <em>Bloomberg</em>’s Mark Gurman notes. The new machine was spotted running macOS 14, which Apple is expected to announce at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-wwdc-2023-begins-june-5th-171718339.html"><ins>WWDC 2023</ins></a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>About the most interesting detail revealed by the logs is that the 15-inch MacBook Air features a display resolution “equal” to that of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-review-2023-m2-pro-max-140048268.html">14-inch MacBook Pro</a>. That means the new MacBook Air features a less dense display. It’s unclear when Apple plans to release the new laptop. The company announced the M2 MacBook Air at WWDC 2022.

<p>Elon Musk, who’s been vocally critical about artificial intelligence lately, seems to be planning something AI related. According to <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2f007401-3eaa-4237-b69b-54ccbe125502&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Wall+Street+Journal&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyZjAwNzQwMS0zZWFhLTQyMzctYjY5Yi01NGNjYmUxMjU1MDIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9lbG9uLW11c2tzLW5ldy1hcnRpZmljaWFsLWludGVsbGlnZW5jZS1idXNpbmVzcy14LWFpLWluY29ycG9yYXRlcy1pbi1uZXZhZGEtOTYyYzdjMmYiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImVhMGUyNWRiLTJhMDctNGEzZS1hYTU1LTViZDU2YzkzY2FiMiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAdb_RF11f7LJhSHMrNLV4cLjYAgi9IBEh19TV1yuqJcM&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Felon-musks-new-artificial-intelligence-business-x-ai-incorporates-in-nevada-962c7c2f"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> and <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2a96995b-c799-4281-8b60-b235e84aefe4"><em>The Financial Times</em></a>, Musk has founded a new artificial intelligence company called X.AI Corp. Based on a state filing from last month that the sources have viewed, the new company is incorporated in Nevada and lists Musk as the sole director, as well as Jared Birchall, the director of his family’s offices, as the secretary. The multi-company executive is known to have a special affinity for the letter ”X” and has even recently renamed Twitter, Inc. as X Corp.</p><p>Musk is no stranger to AI projects. He co-founded OpenAI before leaving the company almost a decade ago. After ChatGPT’s meteoric rise in popularity, though, Musk advocated for the technology’s regulation and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/29/elon-musk-other-tech-leaders-pause-training-ai-beyond-gpt-4.html">signed an open letter</a> that urged tech leaders to put a six-month pause on its development. <em>The Journal</em> says Musk thought ChatGPT was politically biased — he once <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1603836383885332480?s=20">commented</a> on the “danger of training AI to be woke” — and that he’s looking create AI models that are “truth-seeking.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At this point, though, Musk’s plans for X.AI Corp and whether he’s looking to build a veritable ChatGPT rival remains unclear. While details are still scarce, previous reports provide clues on how Musk’s AI efforts are progressing. He reportedly hired two former DeepMind researchers in March, including scientist Igor Babuschkin, who’s believed to be helming the new project. Musk also reportedly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-reportedly-bought-thousands-of-gpus-for-a-twitter-ai-project-214535382.html">purchased 10,000 GPUs</a> for AI development at one of Twitter’s data centers. In addition, according to <em>The Times</em>, he’s already in talks with Tesla and SpaceX investors to put money into his new venture.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-has-created-his-own-artificial-intelligence-company-012103279.html?src=rss
