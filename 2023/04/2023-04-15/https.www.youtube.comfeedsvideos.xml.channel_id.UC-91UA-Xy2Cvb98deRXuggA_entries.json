The focus is on controlling what can be controlled - providing excellent customer service, treating coworkers with kindness and respect, and looking towards a bright future. The CEO encourages employees to focus on the company\u2019s financial goals instead of worrying about not receiving a bonus. The message is clear - lead by example, avoid self-pity, and get the job done.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kE_14tWdMI", "date_published": "2023-04-15 17:30:54+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
