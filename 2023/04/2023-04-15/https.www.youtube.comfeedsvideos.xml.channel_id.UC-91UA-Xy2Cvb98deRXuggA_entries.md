In this video, the CEO of MillerKnoll addresses the issue of motivation in the face of no bonuses due to COVID-19 and other unforeseen circumstances. The focus is on controlling what can be controlled - providing excellent customer service, treating coworkers with kindness and respect, and looking towards a bright future. The CEO encourages employees to focus on the company’s financial goals instead of worrying about not receiving a bonus. The message is clear - lead by example, avoid self-pity, and get the job done.
