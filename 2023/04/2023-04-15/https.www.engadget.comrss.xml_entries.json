In addition to all the technical hurdles it has had to overcome, the FAA put the company\u2019s Boca Chica facility through a comprehensive environmental assessment.

Based on a state filing from last month that the sources have viewed, the new company is incorporated in Nevada and lists Musk as the sole director, as well as Jared Birchall, the director of his family\u2019s offices, as the secretary. The multi-company executive is known to have a special affinity for the letter \u201dX\u201d and has even recently renamed Twitter, Inc. as X Corp.</p><p>Musk is no stranger to AI projects.

He reportedly hired two former DeepMind researchers in March, including scientist Igor Babuschkin, who\u2019s believed to be helming the new project. Musk also reportedly <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-reportedly-bought-thousands-of-gpus-for-a-twitter-ai-project-214535382.html\">purchased 10,000 GPUs</a> for AI development at one of Twitter\u2019s data centers.
