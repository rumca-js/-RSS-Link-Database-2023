  <p id="wNwDXC">Happy Saturday, friends! When it comes to workout-friendly earbuds that are aimed at the gym, we spend a lot of time propping up the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22753158/beats-fit-pro-earbuds-review-apple">Beats Fit Pro</a>. However, if you’re in need of something that’s easier on your wallet, <strong>Anker’s Soundcore Sport X10 </strong>are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Soundcore-Bluetooth-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof/dp/B09WMJCQRM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">on sale in black at Amazon for $55.99</a> ($24 off), nearly matching their best price to date.</p>
<p id="7eMey3">The X10 pack a lot of value into their sub-$60 package. Their flexible, wraparound hooks ensure a secure fit regardless of your activity, and they offer bass-heavy sound that’s well-suited for the kind of beat-driven tracks that often define our gym playlist (err, or at least my gym playlist). They round out said feature set with up to eight hours of playback, a useful transparency mode, and an IPX7...</p>

  <p id="CFlkUr">Bluesky is really, really fun.</p>
<p id="0P8JO3">Yes, the platform is essentially just <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/28/23619270/decentralized-twitter-alternative-bluesky-ios-invite-only">Twitter but decentralized</a>. And yes, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/28/23619270/decentralized-twitter-alternative-bluesky-ios-invite-only">Jack Dorsey-backed Bluesky</a> is one of many services <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">emulating</a> <a href="https://post.news/">how</a> <a href="https://substack.com/notes">Twitter</a> <a href="https://t2.social/">looks</a> right now. But after spending a few hours in Bluesky since getting my beta invite this week, it’s so far the service where I feel the most joy.</p>
<p id="gdDZkg">Similar to Mastodon, Bluesky is a federated social network, which, at its most basic level, means that users can participate through different providers instead of a huge central one. The easiest comparison is email: if you have Gmail, you can send an email to somebody on Apple’s iCloud, and they can reply back to you.</p>
<p id="qzr6NA">Bluesky lets you pick from different hosting providers. When I joined the app on Tuesday, I...</p>

## Why I’m using a keyboard phone in 2023

  <p id="ArEdyD">For the past month, I’ve been using <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22441669/unihertz-titan-pocket-hands-on-blackberry-keyboard-android-phone">the Unihertz Titan Pocket</a>, a phone released in 2021 that rocks a 3.1-inch display above a full Qwerty keyboard. To be clear, it’s been by choice — my editors didn’t assign me to do this as a prank (in fact, some of them have clowned on me for using it), and it’s not like I don’t have other options. I’ve got a perfectly good iPhone 12 Mini that I actively gave up to switch to this phone.</p>
<p id="v1o6lF">So uh... why?</p>
<p id="Vw4mz2">The first reason is that it can just be kind of fun to try something new. Or, in this case, go back to something old; my first experiences with a smartphone were stealing my dad’s Navy-issued BlackBerry to email my significant other when I was in middle school. But for the past 10 years or so, the phones...</p>
