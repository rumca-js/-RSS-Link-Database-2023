Hello! Today we go on a secret adventure to check out some of the newest VR devices from HTC. From a mind blowing trippy mixed reality experience to one of the coolest updates in the world of full body tracking.. I think its time we look at how far VR has come!

We've come a long way since Quest 2, Index, and Cosmos.
