Its been an interesting week in entertainment with the revelation that only 1/3 of viewers actually watched Rings of Power to the end, The Mandalorian losing more than 20% of its audience over last season, and the new Super Mario Brothers movie heading for a massive opening weekend. Join me, MauLer, Disparu and Echo Chamberlain at the Open Bar as we talk about it all.
