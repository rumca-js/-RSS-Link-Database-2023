<p>The Super Mario Bros. Movie is in theaters now, but it's not actually Hollywood's first attempt at a Mario movie. In 1993, directors Annabel Jankel and Rocky Morton made the live-action Super Mario Bros., starring Bob Hoskins as Mario and John Leguizamo as Luigi. It was panned by critics.</p><p>A key difference between 1993's Super Mario Bros. and The Super Mario Bros. Movie is that Nintendo is directly involved with the new animated movie, and Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto himself is an executive producer.</p><p>Morton told <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/1993-super-mario-bros-movie-directors-what-went-wrong-1235574696/">Variety</a> that he had a "polite" meeting with Miyamoto before production on the first Mario film began, but the two never spoke again. Nintendo basically licensed the movie to Hollywood, and the rest is history. Despite the cold reception to the movie, Morton claims Miyamoto actually enjoyed Super Mario Bros.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/miyamoto-would-have-vetoed-ideas-for-the-1993-super-mario-bros-movie-director-says/1100-6513045/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Three weeks after its mid-March theatrical release, Shazam! Fury of the Gods is set to hit digital platforms on April 7. This comes after the sequel to 2019's Shazam had a disappointing box office performance, so far reportedly bringing in roughly $120 million worldwide--or barely breaking even, per <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt10151854/?ref_=bo_rl_ti">Box Office Mojo</a> data.</p><p dir="ltr">The new film sees Asher Angel's Billy Batson transform into Zachary Levi's superhero alter ego, Shazam, to take on the daughters of Atlas, played by Lucy Liu, Helen Mirren, and Rachel Zegler. The digital release will include both rental and purchase options, with a rental costing $20 for a 48-hour viewing window and a purchase costing $25 for premium digital ownership. The physical copy release date is expected to be on May 23.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">Say the magic word — bring SHAZAM!

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a>'s Grandmaster Nightfalls will begin on April 11, bringing with it two new Adept weapons to earn in this challenging PvE activity. Players will be able to get their hands on The Buzzard, a Kinetic adaptive sidearm that includes perks like Kinetic Tremors, and The Swarm, an Arc machine gun that has the popular Target Lock perk in its roll.</p><p>For players looking to gild their Conqueror seal, six featured Nightfalls will be available to them and can be completed as quickly as they would like to, <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/this-week-at-bungie-04-06-23">according to Bungie</a>.

Players will be capped 25 levels below enemies, who will be at 1840. That means players' effective power will be no higher than 1815.

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/">World of Warcraft</a>: Dragonflight <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-dragonflight-return-to-the-forbidden-reach-update-lands-on-march-21/1100-6512141/">patch 10.0.7</a> brought with it a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-will-rework-one-of-wow-dragonflight-worst-dps-specializations/1100-6510987/">much-needed rework to Retribution Paladins</a> in order to improve their performance. However, Blizzard may have gone too far in the other direction, as what was once one of the MMORPG's lesser-played DPS specs has now skyrocketed to the top of the PvP and PvE charts, much to the frustration of non-Paladin players.</p><p dir="ltr">In many ways, a rework for a specialization in the middle of a content season is almost unheard of, and is something typically reserved for major milestone patches or new expansion launches. In an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-dragonflight-embers-of-neltharion-update-will-take-players-deep-underground-to-discover-deathwings-secrets/1100-6512139/">interview with GameSpot</a>, game director Ion Hazzikostas said the Retribution rework that came with patch 10.0.7 was an "exceptional" circumstance and not something that players should expect to see happen with other specs over the course of Dragonflight.</p><p dir="ltr">The fact still remains, however, that the Retribution rework has brought a major shakeup to both PvE and PvP in the middle of season. The spec is now among the most played in the game in terms of its appearance in endgame content. A look at <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/dragonflight-season-1-dps-rankings-week-16-mythic-vault-of-the-incarnates-332292">Mythic raid statistics</a> from the week of March 28 shows Retribution Paladins at the top of high-level Mythic raid play when it comes to overall damage done, and is the third most-played spec for the week behind Beast Mastery Hunters and Havoc Demon Hunters. On the Mythic+ dungeon front, <a href="https://www.icy-veins.com/forums/topic/72084-the-most-popular-specializations-for-mythic-in-dragonflight-season-1-week-16/">statistics</a> reveal Retribution Paladins were found in nearly 14% of all Mythic+ dungeon runs for the week of March 28, an impressive number considering it is just one of 25 damage specializations currently in the game. For context, the <a href="https://www.icy-veins.com/forums/topic/71818-the-most-popular-specializations-for-mythic-in-dragonflight-season-1-week-14/">week before patch 10.0.7 arrived</a>, Ret Paladins were only found in 1.68% of Mythic+ dungeon runs.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-wow-dragonflight-specialization-is-now-dominating-in-both-pvp-and-pve-and-players-arent-happy/1100-6513041/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Overwatch 2 Season 4 is shaping up to be quite the showstopper, and it's not <em>solely </em>due to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-overwatch-2-hero-lifeweaver-has-been-revealed/1100-6512929/">new support hero Lifeweaver's charm and captivatingly-good looks</a>, either. A new blog post has revealed that the upcoming season will see the game's heroes take on intergalactic identities in an epic space opera, in which former friends will be pitted against each other as they are forced to side with either the Watchers or the Infinite Empire.</p><p>Starwatch: Galactic Rescue is the name of the limited-time event that gives players the chance to play space hero--or villain. The mode takes place on a reworked Horizon Lunar Colony, where Watchers will be sent to attack the defending Infinite Empire. As for which heroes are on which sides, a glimpse at the upcoming battle pass reveals Space Prince Lucio and Extraterrestrial Winston swear their allegiance to the Watchers, whereas Infinite Ace D.Va and Seer Mercy hail from the Infinite Empire. The event will run from May 9 through May 22.</p><p>Fortunately, you won't have to wait quite that long for some of Season 4's other exciting events. The first event of Season 4, which celebrates Lifeweaver's Thai origins as well as Thai New Year, starts now, and will run through April 25. The event features an all-new Arcade mode, B.O.B. and Weave, where heroes will face off in a 3v3 deathmatch. In the mode, all players will get the chance to try out Lifeweaver as they band together and utilize the hero's Life Grip ability to pull their team's B.O.B. around the map.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-season-4-sends-heroes-to-a-galaxy-far-far-away-with-an-epic-space-opera-theme/1100-6513039/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau portrayed Jaime Lannister in HBO's Game of Thrones fantasy series, but he hasn't seen the spin-off show, House of the Dragon, just yet. Speaking to <a href="https://ew.com/tv/nikolaj-coster-waldau-hasnt-watched-house-of-the-dragon-yet/">Entertainment Weekly</a>, Coster-Waldau said he plans to wait for "a couple of seasons" and then dive in.</p><p>"I'll wait. I'll give it a couple of seasons, then I can binge watch it and then there's the whole thing," he said. "But I know that so many people love that show, and I'm really happy for them."</p><p>Coster-Waldau did, however, come across the opening sequence for House of the Dragon. He said it was "a little strange" because it uses the same music as the original Game of Thrones.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-of-thrones-star-explains-why-he-hasnt-watched-house-of-the-dragon-yet/1100-6513033/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>For more than four years now, the Epic Games Store has regularly given away free games. Every Thursday at 8 AM PT / 11 AM ET, Epic offers at least one free PC game (sometimes two or three, though!). All you need to do to claim the free games is <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/id/register">create a free Epic account</a> and enable two-factor authentication to start snagging freebies. You have a week to add the freebies to your library before the new one(s) take their place. At this point, Epic has given away hundreds of free games, and there's no sign that the program will stop any time soon. We keep this article up to date weekly to highlight both the current free games and next week's offerings.</p><h2>Current free game at Epic</h2><figure style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4122493-dyinglight.jpeg"><img alt="Dying Light" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1595/15950357/4122493-dyinglight.jpeg" /></a><figcaption>Dying Light</figcaption></figure><p> </p><p>From now until <strong>April 13 at 8 AM PT / 11 AM ET</strong>, you can claim Dying Light: Enhanced Edition and Shapez. Epic had originally announced that the pirate-themed battle royale game Blazing Sails would be free, but a switch was made. Shapez is a relaxing sim that tasks you with building factories that create shapes. It couldn't be more different than Dying Light, which is a tense and demanding open-world survival game.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/snag-2-free-games-at-epic-including-dying-light/1100-6476419/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Celeste Classic Demakes The Original Game For Playdate

<p>One of the most beloved indie games of recent memory, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/celeste/">Celeste</a>, is making a leap to a new platform. Billed as an "unofficial" port from developer Pico-8, <a href="https://hteumeuleu.itch.io/celeste">Celeste Classic on Playdate</a> features a simpler visual design in comparison to the more colorful source material. This is <em>technically </em>a free game, but if you want to support the hard-working developers behind this port, you can pay what you feel is fair for the game.</p><p>The most obvious change is the monochromatic color palette, but Pico-8 says that a lot of visual elements have an outline to make them more readable. In terms of resolution, this version of Celeste is actually an upgrade as it has been increased from the original game's 128x128 resolution to 256x240. Four pixel lines are cropped at the top and bottom of the screen, and for purists, the game can be played at its original resolution by disabling the Fullscreen option.</p><p>Another change in Celeste Classic is a new and optional assist mode. When activated, it will allow you to skip a level, change the game speed to 0.5×, get infinite dashes, and enable invincibility. The catch here is that if you do use the assist mode during a run, a mention is added on each level in the lower right corner, as well as in the pause screen and the final score screen. Prepare for scorn from the more "hardcore" side of the Celeste community if you choose to go public with your runs.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/celeste-classic-demakes-the-original-game-for-playdate/1100-6513029/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>After three long decades, a new Super Mario Bros movie has arrived--and it's pretty great! The animated film was made with all sorts of love for the Mario IP, but much more importantly: It's crafted with skill and genuine cleverness. It's a good movie, full stop. But it's also a good <em>Mario movie</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">If you want a spoiler-free discussion to help you decide if you want to make a trip to the theater this week, you can and should check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-super-mario-bros-movie-review-actually-awesome/1900-6418051/">Super Mario Bros.

As such: <strong>there are major spoilers ahead for The Super Mario Bros Movie. </strong>You have been warned.</p><h2 dir="ltr">That Super Mario Bros. plumbing commercial</h2><p dir="ltr">The Super Mario Bros Movie starts with a cold open that shows Bowser's ongoing conquest of the universe that the Mushroom Kingdom is in--we saw a condensed version of this scene in the first trailer for the movie. It sets the epic stakes of the story and is full of faux-gritty seriousness. And then it cuts to a local plumbing commercial, starring Brooklyn's own Mario and Luigi, complete with a ditty inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkWYP95WbbY&amp;ab_channel=cheesymovienight">the Super Mario Bros Super Show theme song</a>.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-7-best-and-funniest-parts-of-the-super-mario-bros-movie/1100-6512971/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Fallout 4 Steam Update Fuels Rumors Of A New Vegas Sequel

<p dir="ltr">Rumors are swirling among fans of the Fallout franchise after a new branch titled "newvegas2" was added to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fallout-4/">Fallout 4</a>'s backend. The branch was made visible to players via <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/377160/history/">Steam DB</a>, after an update on April 4.</p><p dir="ltr">Although the reference to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fallout-new-vegas/">Fallout: New Vegas</a> was quickly deleted, speculation among players has only intensified. The branch was gone by April 5, but its existence points to a potential for new content, and the branch's name and swift removal suggest Bethesda may be trying to quiet down rumors. Naturally, this has had the opposite effect, with many players <a href="https://twitter.com/G27Status/status/1643684530178465816">excitedly tweeting their theories</a> on what this could mean for the franchise.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, the branch showed up in Fallout 4, meaning it's could be related to that game instead. The most likely option seems to be new Fallout 4 content referencing New Vegas, like a Creation Club Pack featuring designs and motifs from the beloved game. Since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-4-is-getting-free-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s-upgrades-in-2023/1100-6508551/">Fallout 4 is due for a next-gen update sometime this year</a>, the mysterious "newvegas2" branch could simply be related to upcoming in-game content meant mainly for nostalgic purposes--not a full-on sequel to New Vegas.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-4-steam-update-fuels-rumors-of-a-new-vegas-sequel/1100-6513030/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Diablo 3 has received nearly 30 seasons over its decade of life. Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end, and the game's developers have now said that Season 29 will be its last.</p><p dir="ltr">In a <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/diablo-iv-group-interview-unveils-new-information-future-of-diablo-iii-332278">Wowhead group interview</a> with Diablo 4 game director Joe Shely and franchise general manager Rod Fergusson, Fergusson stated that season 29 will be the last to feature new content for Diablo 3. Starting with Season 30, the game will mix and match cosmetics and features that made up previous seasons of the game, and that all future development efforts will go into Diablo 4.</p><p dir="ltr">It's the end of an era for the franchise's third entry, which overcame a rocky launch to become a well-received game in its own right. Its recent Season 28 added a meta progression system called that Altar of Rites that breathed new life into the game, which first released over a decade ago in 2012.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-3-will-begin-rotating-through-old-seasons-soon/1100-6513028/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>PlayStation 5 consoles are rarely discounted, but right now, you can grab not only the Sony console at a reduced rate but also an excellent game to play on it as well. Over on Amazon, the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-PS5-Console-Ragnar%C3%B6k-Bundle-5/dp/B0BHC395WW?tag=gamespot-promos-20">PS5 God of War: Ragnarok bundle</a></strong> is available for just <strong>$509 </strong>instead of its usual retail price of $560. You could view this as buying God of War: Ragnarok for a mere $9. This deal probably won't be available for long.</p><figure style="width: 1280px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4122463-ps5-gow.jpg"><img alt="PS5 God of War Ragnarok bundle" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4122463-ps5-gow.jpg" /></a><figcaption>PS5 God of War Ragnarok bundle</figcaption></figure><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-PS5-Console-Ragnarök-Bundle-5/dp/B0BHC395WW?tag=gamespot-promos-20">See at Amazon</a> </div></div><p> </p><p>This particular bundle includes the regular PS5 console that has a built-in disc drive, so you'll be able to play both physical and digital games on it. Stock was originally hard to come by when the PS5 first launched, but with those issues sorted, now is a great time to acquire Sony's current-gen console. Thanks to several major firmware updates, the console user interface is friendlier and more efficient than ever, while the library of PS5 exclusive games has also increased considerably.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-god-of-war-ragnarok-bundle-gets-a-nice-discount-at-amazon/1100-6513023/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>A new patent application suggests that Sony is looking to implement temperature feedback into its PlayStation controllers.</p><p>First spotted by <a href="https://exputer.com/news/industry/sony-elastic-improve-haptic-feedback/">Exputer</a>, Sony <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=US394370039&amp;_cid=P11-LFXU5H-40413-1">filed a patent application</a> for a material that can simulate temperature feedback to its PlayStation controllers in order to reflect what is going on during gameplay. The filing notes that typical gaming controllers usually use plastic materials that are hard to bend or deform.</p><p>The purpose of the technology is to bring that issue to light and create a way to provide a more enriching haptic experience. The filing reads, "An aspect of the present invention to solve the above problem of the conventional example is a controller that includes a sensor using an elastically deformable elastic member, and this sensor detects user's contact with or deforming action of the elastic member and outputs an electric signal based on the detected contact or deforming action in question."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-files-patent-application-for-temperature-changing-ps5-controller/1100-6513026/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The UK government's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has <a href="https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/microsoft-slash-activision-blizzard-merger-inquiry">published the responses</a> to its provisional finding that Microsoft's proposed deal to buy Activision <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/uk-paves-the-way-for-microsoft-to-buy-activision-blizzard-but-key-hurdles-remain/1100-6512673/">would not limit competition in the console space</a>.

SIE said the CMA did a "u-turn," calling the move "surprising, unprecedented, and irrational." SIE said there existed a "significant body" of evidence to support the suggestion that Microsoft could be incentivized to "withhold" Activision content from PlayStation platforms, thus lessening competition.</p><p>The CMA said in its updated response that Microsoft would have no financial incentive to make Call of Duty and other Activision content exclusive to Xbox. This is a point that Microsoft itself has been making, saying it makes no business sense to take Call of Duty off PlayStation.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-says-uks-u-turn-on-microsoft-activision-deal-is-surprising-unprecedented-and-irrational/1100-6513017/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Star Wars Jedi Survivor PC Specs Confirmed, 155GB Free Space Required

<p>EA has released the official PC requirements for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-jedi-survivor/">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a> ahead of its launch later this month, and for anyone running low on storage space, you're going to need to be like Obi-Wan Kenobi in a Tattooine bar and make some cuts. The hardware requirements aren't too heavy to get the game running, but EA and developer Respawn Interactive are advising that you keep a staggering 155 GB of space on your drive for the Fallen Order sequel.</p><p>While game sizes have grown substantially over the years. the Jedi: Survivor requirements place it in the upper ranks of storage capacity requirements. It's more demanding in this category than Final Fantasy XV (100GB), Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II (125GB), and Red Dead Redemption 2 (150GB), falling just a few gigabytes short of Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond, which clocks in at 180GB of required storage capacity.</p><p><a href="https://www.ea.com/games/starwars/jedi/jedi-survivor/pc-system-requirements">For the rest of the PC requirements</a>, the numbers are much easier on the eye. EA recommends a GPU with 8GB of VRAM such as the Nvidia RTX 2070 or AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT, although you should be fine with an Nvidia GTX 1070 or a Radeon RX 580 for the bare minimum needed to get the game running. If you were able to get Fallen Order working on your PC, you should be able to run Jedi: Survivor just fine.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-survivor-pc-specs-confirmed-155gb-free-space-required/1100-6513018/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
