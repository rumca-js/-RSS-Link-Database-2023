visual programming with AI", "description": "<p>Hi HN,<p>We\u2019re Retool (<a href=\"https://retool.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://retool.com</a>), a visual programming environment for building internal tools. Here\u2019s a 3 minute demo video: <a href=\"https://d3399nw8s4ngfo.cloudfront.net/videos/intro-to-retool.mp4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://d3399nw8s4ngfo.cloudfront.net/videos/intro-to-retool...</a>.<p>You can think of Retool as something like Visual Basic, but in the cloud. The idea is that there are lots of internal applications that businesses need, and today, build from scratch (probably via React). But while React is great for many things (our landing page is built in React, our product is built in React, etc.), it\u2019s possible that it might be overkill for building a simple form that POSTs data back to your API. (Who _wants_ to worry about debouncing the submit button, handling errors from the backend, and authenticating and authorizing the users?)<p>We launched on HN around five years ago (<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17725966\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17725966</a>). Since then, we\u2019ve launched three new products \u2013 a native mobile product (<a href=\"https://retool.com/products/mobile\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://retool.com/products/mobile</a>), an automation product for developers (<a href=\"https://retool.com/products/workflows/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://retool.com/products/workflows/</a>), and a database product (<a href=\"https://retool.com/products/database/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://retool.com/products/database/</a>).  We\u2019ve hired and grown the team to over 350, and are proud to have businesses like Doordash, NBC Universal, Mercedes Benz, and the NFL using Retool.<p>The network at Retool is also fairly strong \u2014 our lead investors in the Series B were Sequoia, along with Elad Gil, Nat Friedman, as well as John and Patrick Collison. Other investors include the founders of Github, Gusto, Segment, PagerDuty, Plaid, etc.<p>This year, while other companies are downsizing, we\u2019re doubling down. (Literally.) We\u2019re attempting to double our engineering, product, and design orgs this year. We think the opportunity to invent the future of programming is enormous, and we\u2019re looking for more hackers to join our team.<p>We think that AI is going to change the way people build software. We think that there is tremendous potential in building interfaces that help humans and AI collaborate together to build software. We want to build a world where humans can quickly assemble full applications by just providing high level directions to AI.<p>We believe we\u2019re set up especially well to do just that \u2013 we have all the building blocks for creating software (frontends, backend compute, data storage) as well as a live interactive builder environment. Why entangle yourself with messy things like Webpack, Docker, and Kubernetes when you can directly manipulate a live app, running right in front of you?<p>We also think that the world, as a whole, is under-utilizing AI. Businesses are broadly interested in generative AI and LLMs, but don\u2019t know how yet to leverage and use them. It should be simple for businesses to quickly set up flows to have AI automatically triage bug reports, summarize customer feedback, and enrich datasets.<p>We\u2019ve shared a sneak peak of what we think some of this could look like (<a href=\"https://retool.com/blog/gpt4-in-retool/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://retool.com/blog/gpt4-in-retool/</a>), and there\u2019s a bunch more coming up that we\u2019re really excited to talk about soon.<p>If you\u2019re interested in working with AIs and LLMs to change the way companies build software, we\u2019d love to hear from you. We've made multiple hires from HN in the past, so we\u2019re posting here. But if you know any friends who are interested, feel free to tell them to reach out as well.<p>Please email us at snir AT retool with \u201cHN\u201d in the subject line.<p>Thanks!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35471227\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35471227</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35471227", "date_published": "2023-04-06 17:01:35+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "ChatGPT: Mayor starts legal bid over false bribery claim", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-65202597\">https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-65202597</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35471211\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35471211</a></p>\n<p>Points: 23</p>\n<p># Comments: 14</p>", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-65202597", "date_published": "2023-04-06 17:00:41+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Show HN: ADHD-friendly pomodoro web app", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://brainpls.work/\">https://brainpls.work/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35471129\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35471129</a></p>\n<p>Points: 7</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>", "link": "https://brainpls.work/", "date_published": "2023-04-06 16:55:11+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Show HN: Machato \u2014 A native macOS client for ChatGPT", "description": "<p>Machato is a tiny ChatGPT client that supports all basic features, and more !<p>I was frustrated with other native implementations that focused on quick access but didn't give easy access to a history of what has been said.

We wanted to build a tool for JIT access that was <i>actually</i> designed for developers. We were wary of tools that tried to accommodate both devs and IT but ended up with usability compromises for both.<p>First, we figured no one wants another web app to log into so we let administrators define access workflows in Terraform and let developers request and gain access via Slack. That seemed to pay off: being code-based was a big plus for our early customers since it let them manage the logic in version control and test in CI/CD.<p>Second, we knew that updating permissions/roles/access was a major source of toil and risk in the world of cloud infrastructure. Have you ever tried to avoid annoying, persistent access requests by setting policies that are a bit more permissive than you\u2019d like? We felt that fully automated just-in-time access + approvals could really help here. But we also knew that a simple approval tool could end up leading to request fatigue - kind of defeating the purpose. So we built an SDK to let you define checks in code (e.g. pagerduty.on_call, okta.is_user_in_group,  github.get_repo_collaborators) in order to dynamically route requests or fast-track access when appropriate. This seems to be paying off: users are creating Slack-based approvals in front of different types of risky actions like production access, sensitive queries and triggering Lambdas.<p>We\u2019d love your feedback on our approach so far. Does this make sense to you? Is this a tool you'd use? What would you want to see out of it?<p>To learn more, check out the video that Nick (nmeans (Sym VPEng)) made [1]. You can also check out our docs [2] or set up your own flow [3].<p>thanks!<p>-adam<p>[1] <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/815222490/c717c18c42\"
