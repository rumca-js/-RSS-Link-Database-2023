<p>Twitter has finally shut off its free API and, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-shutting-off-free-api-prepare-174340770.html"><ins>predictably</ins></a>, it’s breaking a lot of apps and websites. The company had previously said it would cut off access in early February, but later <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-delays-api-changes-again-this-time-by-a-few-more-days-225636959.html"><ins>delayed </ins></a>the move without providing an updated timeline.</p><p>But, after announcing its new paid API tiers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-announces-new-api-pricing-including-a-limited-free-tier-for-bots-005251253.html"><ins>last week</ins></a>, the company seems to have started cutting off the thousands of developers relying on its free developer tools. Over the last couple days, a number of app makers and other services have reported that the Twitter API is no longer functioning. <em>Mashable </em><a href="https://mashable.com/article/twitter-cuts-off-api-access-apps"><ins>reported</ins></a> the shutoff seems to have started Tuesday morning, though many developers are still trying to understand what’s happening as Twitter doesn’t seem to have communicated with most developers about the changes.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The ending of Twitter’s free API comes after the company abruptly changed its rules <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-new-developer-terms-ban-third-party-clients-211247096.html"><ins>to ban </ins></a>third-party Twitter clients as part of a larger shakeup of its developer strategy. But, as we’ve previously <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-shutting-off-free-api-prepare-174340770.html"><ins>reported</ins></a>, third-party clients were only a small fraction of the developers, researchers, bot makers and others who relied on Twitter’s APIs.</p><p>For example, apps and websites that used Twitter’s API to enable sharing of content to and from Twitter are now seeing that functionality break. WordPress reported Tuesday that it was no longer able to access the API, rendering its websites unable to automatically share posts to Twitter. (The issue has since <a href="https://wordpress.com/blog/2023/04/04/twitter-functionality-is-restored/"><ins>been fixed</ins></a>, according to the company.)</p><div id="c3a2c578fb30491e80dc1e9dbb1e63bf"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Our access to the Twitter API is currently blocked. As a result, Jetpack Social is temporarily unable to automatically share your posts directly from <a href="https://t.co/eRvNKWaolr">https://t.co/eRvNKWaolr</a> to Twitter.  We have reached out to Twitter for more information on how to get unblocked.</p>— WordPress.com (@wordpressdotcom) <a href="https://twitter.com/wordpressdotcom/status/1643240046621802497?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 4, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>Likewise, Echobox, a service that allows publishers to share content on Twitter, said <a href="https://twitter.com/EchoboxHQ/status/1643551612026122241"><ins>on Wednesday</ins></a> it was also disconnected from the Twitter API “without warning.” The company said it found a workaround, but hadn’t heard from Twitter. News reading app Flipboard, which recently began shifting its focus <a href="https://www.engadget.com/flipboard-is-leaning-into-mastodon-and-away-from-twitter-160036103.html"><ins>to Mastodon</ins></a>, also warned that anyone who used Flipboard to view Twitter feeds would soon see the feature disabled.</p><div id="0f865b793f6c440392319083a808aeab"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Twitter, once a public square for ideas, is shutting off its API and closing its gates to other platforms, including Flipboard.

The maker of “Cheap Bots Done Quick,” which allows people to create bots for Twitter, reported receiving a notice that they were <a href="https://twitter.com/v21/status/1643932890105884673"><ins>cut off </ins></a>from the API. Twitter has said that its new “basic” tier is meant to provide a pathway to allow bots to continue, but many developers have said the monthly limit of 1,500 tweets is too constrained.</p><p>Newsletter platform Substack is also <a href="https://twitter.com/SubstackInc/status/1644059805315747844"><ins>having issues</ins></a> using <a href="https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1644038985654628353"><ins>embedded tweets</ins></a>, though it’s unclear if this is related to the API shutdown or the company recently announcing a potential <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/5/23670452/substack-notes-tweets-posts-twitter"><ins>Twitter competitor</ins></a>. (Embeds seem to be functioning normally on other websites, including this one.)</p><p>All of these issues are further complicated by the fact that Twitter seems to have communicated very little with any of its developers about these changes or what they mean. Most of the employees who worked in developer relations were cut during the company’s mass layoffs. And the company’s developer forums <a href="https://twittercommunity.com/"><ins>are filled</ins></a> with posts from confused developers looking for answers. The company no longer has a communications team, and its press email auto-responds with a poop emoji.</p><p>As <em>Mashable</em><a href="https://mashable.com/article/twitter-cuts-off-api-access-apps"><ins>points out</ins></a>, the shutoff has even affected developers who <em>are</em> willing to pay for Twitter’s API, even though pricing for higher-level enterprise tiers is still unclear. “When Twitter announced these new tiers last week, we immediately sought to sign up for the Enterprise tier,” Echobox wrote in a <a href="https://www.echobox.com/resources/blog/echobox-hit-by-twitter-turmoil-but-a-solution-is-on-the-horizon/"><ins>blog post</ins></a> on Wednesday. “ We still have had no response from Twitter’s enterprise sales team and our access to the API was cut off without notice yesterday.”</p><p>News app Tweet Shelf said its API access had also <a href="https://twitter.com/TweetShelfHQ/status/1643175108255571968"><ins>been suspended </ins></a>despite applying for Enterprise API access. So did <a href="https://twitter.com/TweetDeleter/status/1643591580828278785"><ins>TweetDeleter</ins></a>, a service for automatically deleting tweets, and <a href="https://twitter.com/tweetarchivist/status/1643644124158128130"><ins>Tweet Archivist</ins></a> an analytics tool.&nbsp;</p><p>But it’s still unclear how many developers will be able to continue using Twitter’s API in some form. The free and $100/month “basic” tier are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-announces-new-api-pricing-including-a-limited-free-tier-for-bots-005251253.html"><ins>extremely limited</ins></a> compared to what was previously offered for free. And, while Twitter hasn’t revealed exactly how much the “enterprise” level will cost, many are expecting it to be prohibitively expensive – rumors have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/29/twitter-announces-new-api-with-only-free-basic-and-enterprise-levels/"><ins>suggested</ins></a> it could cost $40,000 a month or more.</p><div id="4e8f95dfbfe943b69f244ce5ba923ed5"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">I am sad to announce that as of today, Social Bearing is no longer operational as our access to Twitter's free API has been revoked<br /><br />The new free and basic API plans are far too limiting, and at ~$40k/month, the enterprise tier is far too expensive to keep running <a href="https://t.co/wpGTTC8Lkp">pic.twitter.com/wpGTTC8Lkp</a></p>— Social Bearing (@socialbearing) <a href="https://twitter.com/socialbearing/status/1643335908668702720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 4, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>Some developers aren’t even waiting to find out the pricing details.

<p>Pop star Maggie Rogers isn’t going to let bots spoil her upcoming tour. The “Alaska” singer told fans in an email today that she’s getting a jump on automated scalpers by selling tickets the old-fashioned way: in-person sales.</p><p>Rogers says fans can physically walk up to box offices on Friday to get first dibs on pre-sale tickets for her US summer tour, running from July to August. “On Friday, for one day only, we’re running an in-person pre-sales, where you can go directly to your local box office to buy a ticket,” wrote the artist, who rose to fame after a video of Pharrell Williams <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=89f68c82-f255-44fa-8db9-03fec996b93a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YouTube&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4OWY2OGM4Mi1mMjU1LTQ0ZmEtOGRiOS0wM2ZlYzk5NmI5M2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1UeWltQ0dFa2lVYyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiODcwZmU3ZGUtMmYwYy00NmZkLWFmMTYtMzVmNzRjY2I1ODE1In0&amp;signature=AQAAAYr3kR9XW2v9YjuI73i1ccuPYcU5aFgZMkwYmXxNfczt&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DTyimCGEkiUc">reacting to her “Alaska” demo</a> went viral in 2016. “There’s a two-ticket-per-person limit, but you can choose any ticket you want — all of the prices and tiers will be available, along with exclusive merch and a special playlist I cooked up just for box office day.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Rogers says the in-person process will vary from city to city, and she advises fans to <a href="https://www.maggierogers.com">check her website</a> for specifics. For fans in the NYC area, she adds that she will visit the Music Hall of Williamsburg box office in Brooklyn on Friday, greeting fans buying tickets for her Forest Hills show scheduled for July 27th.</p><p>If you can't make it to the box office on Friday, Rogers says her website will open registrations for traditional artist pre-sales on April 11th. In addition, Spotify will have its own pre-sales on April 12th with local promoters joining on the 12th and 13th. General availability opens on April 14th.</p><figure><img alt="Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.

After 1.5 million presale codes went out to Taylor Swift fans in November, 14 million buyers (including “a staggering” amount of bots) tried to purchase tickets. The company said it was hit with 3.5 billion system requests, leading to the site crashing and fans left without access.</p><p>That caught the attention of the US Congress, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/aoc-ticketmaster-live-nation-monopoly-interview-1234634599/">called for</a> the breakup of Ticketmaster. Joe Berchtold, President and CFO of Ticketmaster’s parent company Live Nation, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in January, acknowledging the problem but <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ticketmaster-live-nation-senate-judiciary-hearing-195504179.html">punting a resolution</a> to (the largely dysfunctional) Congress. Despite a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/doj-ticketmaster-live-nation-antitrust-investigation-193601939.html">reported DOJ investigation</a>, Senate hearings and the usual political showboating, the government hasn’t yet produced any reforms.</p><p>A similar fiasco unfolded in December when thousands of Bad Bunny fans heading to see the reggaeton star in Mexico City’s Estadio Azteca were denied entry at the door, with staff telling them their Ticketmaster-purchased tickets were fake. That incident led to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ticketmaster-faces-antitrust-scrutiny-mexico-following-bad-bunny-ticket-sales-fiasco-013909231.html">Mexican antitrust scrutiny</a>, but Ticketmaster avoided paying announced fines after it refunded buyers who were denied entry and provided additional compensation.</p><p>Although Rogers deserves credit for an analog solution to a modern-day problem, the story says more about our high-tech, modern-day ticket-purchasing catastrophe as it does the artist’s crafty workaround.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/maggie-rogers-thwarts-ticket-bots-with-in-person-sales-204546294.html?src=rss

## Kia EV9 first look: One of the most important electric SUVs of 2023

<p>After entering a new generation of electrification with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/kia-ev6-gt-first-drive-video-050142389.html">the EV6</a>, this week at the New York Auto Show we got a chance to check out Kia’s upcoming flagship electric SUV in the Kia EV9. And while we weren’t allowed to drive it just yet, after seeing it up close, it low-key might be one of the most important electric vehicles of the year.</p><p>Like the EV6 and Hyudai’s recent EVs including the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundai-ioniq-first-drive-180018819.html">Ioniq 5</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundais-ioniq-6-is-a-value-packed-ev-sedan-141507979.html">Ioniq 6</a>, the EV9 is based on the E-GMP platform which supports an 800-volt architecture and up to 350 kW charging which Kia says can refill the battery from 10 to 80 percent in 25 minutes. As for range, the EV9 will be available in a few different configurations starting with the base model that features a single motor paired to a 76.1 kWh battery, while the long-range version will come with a larger 99.8 kWh power pack. And while Kia has yet to get official numbers from the EPA, it’s expecting the long-range model to deliver about 300 miles on a charge, with the standard-range spec coming in at a bit less (probably around 260 miles or so).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="c8e6d95dbb0d4637adc921b684a1fd05"></div><p>Unfortunately, both of those models won’t be especially quick, with an expected 0 to 60 time of around 8.2 seconds for the base model, which actually goes down to 9.4 seconds for the long-range model due to its bigger and heavier battery. Thankfully, if you want something a bit speedier, there's also the GT-line which gets the same long-range battery but with a more powerful AWD dual motor setup, which promises a 0 to 60 time of 5.3 seconds. Though if that's not enough, Kia president Ho-Sung Song said there will also be a full GT version of the EV9, though it won't be available until sometime in 2025.</p><p>Meanwhile, when it comes to design, while the EV9 features similar proportions to the Telluride, at 197 inches, it’s a touch longer than Kia’s gas-powered SUV. But the real difference is its styling, which is bold and modern, featuring a blocky silhouette softened by just enough curves and sweeping body lines so that it doesn’t look overly sci-fi, like Hyundai’s forthcoming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundai-ioniq-seven-concept-self-driving-ev-213020775.html">Ioniq 7</a>.</p><figure><img alt="At launch, the EV9 will be available in two trim levels: a base model with an optional long-range battery and the more premium GT-line model. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/1e5a43e0-d4b3-11ed-9eff-b9a043a79e67" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>In front, Kia offers what it calls its digital tiger nose grille, which features hidden lights that can even be customized with a selection of animations. On top of that, because the EV9 will be Kia’s first car to support over-the-air updates, you’ll be able to download new software including things like additional lighting patterns post-release. The car also features 15 exterior sensors including two LiDAR arrays in front which use object detection to help the driver spot potential obstacles.</p><p>You also get flush door handles for a sleeker look and improved aerodynamics. And while your taste may differ, I also want to call out the wheels on the EV9. The base model features funky triangular rims with a bit of aerodynamic streamlining, while the GT-line gets 21-inch alloys with a neat plus-shaped design that reminds me of a D-pad from a game controller and seems like a direct nod towards attracting younger buyers.</p><p>And in a way, that’s sort of a theme for the EV9 as a whole, because similar to late-model Teslas, Kia is hopping on the chrome delete trend by using very limited amount of shiny metal and completely eliminating the use of high-gloss finishes (like piano black) throughout the interior vehicle.</p><figure><img alt="Instead of a traditional front fascia, on the EV9 Kia has installed what it call its digital tiger nose grille which features customizable lighting. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/596e2aa0-d4b3-11ed-9fda-030550d43c7f" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Inside, the EV9's design is centered around the idea of &quot;reductionism&quot; and &quot;technology for life&quot; which you can see in things like hidden haptic switches on the dash that are only visible when the car is on and a clever dual-level center console that offers tons of storage for passengers in both the front and second-row seats. Kia even included little design touches like mesh headrests in front, which are meant to give parents an easier way to check in on children in back. The one bummer is that due to U.S. safety regulations, the EV9’s optional second-row swiveling seats will only be available in Korea.</p><p>However, the real star for families is that third row of seats. Even for me at six feet tall, I had no trouble getting in back. Sure, it’s a bit cramped, and if the second row of seats is pushed all the way back there isn’t much room for my legs. But if you don’t mind pushing the seats up a few inches, that third row has more than enough room to accommodate adults on short trips.</p><p>Finally, when it comes to tech, the EV9 should be rather well-equipped. The car will come with a digital car key that works with both NFC and UWB connectivity. There’s also a full-color head-up display for the driver built into the dash along with an optional rear-view camera system instead of a traditional mirror. I also appreciate the EV9’s rather minimalist infotainment system that splits its long, skinny display into two sections: one that extends behind the steering wheel for the driver, while the other half is reserved for general stuff like music, navigation and more. I also think Kia has hit a nice balance between on-screen touch controls and dedicated physical buttons for stuff like heat and AC. And like every good car nowadays, the EV9 has a built-in wireless charger and plenty of USB-C ports (two for every row of seats), plus a full household-style power outlet in the trunk.</p><p>So after taking a close look at the EV9, I think it looks great, it's surprisingly roomy for a midsize SUV, and its tech looks solid too. But more importantly, I think Kia may have succeeded in trying to make an affordable all-purpose three-row EV SUV. That's because while Kia is still waiting to announce official pricing, we're expecting the EV to cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $56,000, which sort of makes it a rarity in the current EV market.</p><figure><img alt="In back, the EV9 features a minimalist design highlighted by its three-branch LED taillights. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/a71eee10-d4b3-11ed-bf9a-506fd462c9d8" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>The EV9’s potential pricing presents a huge discount compared to almost every other three-row EV SUV on the market like the Tesla Model X, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volvo-officially-reveals-the-ex90-ev-suv-its-safest-car-ever-144414196.html">Volvo EX90</a> and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-eqe-suv-first-drive-big-luxury-in-a-smaller-suv-220134605.html">Mercedes EQS SUV</a> – the cheapest of which starts at around $80K. And when you look at the EV9 next similarly-priced rivals like the Model Y or the EQB, while those cars do have optional third rows, they're even more cramped and not suitable for anyone besides children or pets. And then there are others like the BMW iX, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cadillac-lyric-suv-ev-first-drive-video-130014787.html">Cadillac Lyriq</a> which the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/polestar-3-first-look-possibly-the-best-looking-ev-for-2023-133508992.html">Polestar 3</a> we saw last week which are either significantly more expensive or don't even have three-row seating (or both).</p><p>So while a lot will hinge on the EV9’s final price, for people looking for a big but still relatively affordable electric family car, the Kia new flagship EV SUV looks like a great candidate when it eventually comes out sometime later this year.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/kia-ev9-first-look-one-of-the-most-important-electric-suvs-of-2023-200227668.html?src=rss

## What did Twitter’s ‘open source’ algorithm actually reveal? Not a lot.

<p>When Elon Musk first proposed taking over Twitter, one the first changes he claimed he'd make would be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-twitter-ted-181607962.html"><ins>“open-sourcing”</ins></a> Twitter’s algorithm. Last week, Twitter finally followed through on that promise, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitters-recommendation-algorithm-is-now-on-github-200511112.html"><ins>publishing</ins></a> the underlying code for the site’s &quot;For You&quot; recommendations on GitHub.</p><p>Quickly, Twitter sleuths began sifting through the code to see what they could dig up. It didn’t take long for one eyebrow-raising finding: that Musk’s tweets have their <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitters-recommendation-algorithm-is-now-on-github-200511112.html"><ins>own category</ins></a> (along with Democrats, Republicans and “power users”). Twitter engineers hastily explained that this was for “stat tracking purposes,” which has since been confirmed by other <a href="https://github.com/igorbrigadir/awesome-twitter-algo"><ins>analyses</ins></a>. And though Twitter <a href="https://github.com/twitter/the-algorithm/commit/ec83d01dcaebf369444d75ed04b3625a0a645eb9"><ins>removed</ins></a> that section of code from GitHub within hours of its publishing, it’s still fueled speculation that Twitter’s engineers pay special <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-artificially-boost-elon-musk-tweets-053602807.html"><ins>attention</ins></a> to their boss’ engagement and have taken steps to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitters-secret-vip-list-is-the-reason-you-see-elon-musks-tweets-so-often-181735784.html"><ins>artificially</ins></a> boost his tweets.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But there have been few other major revelations about the contents of the code or how Twitter’s algorithm works since. And anyone hoping this public code would produce new insights into the inner workings of Twitter will likely be disappointed. That’s because the code Twitter released omitted important details about how “the algorithm” actually works, according to engineers who have studied it.</p><p>The code Twitter shared was a “highly redacted” version of Twitter’s algorithm, according to <a href="https://solomonmg.github.io/post/twitter-the-algorithm/"><ins>Sol Messing</ins></a>, associate professor at NYU’s Center for Social Media and Politics and former Twitter employee. For one, it  didn't include every system that plays a role in Twitter’s recommendations.</p><p>Twitter said it was withholding code dealing with ads, as well as trust and safety systems in an effort to prevent bad actors from gaming it. The company also opted to withhold the underlying models used to train its algorithm, explaining in a <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2023/a-new-era-of-transparency-for-twitter">blog post</a> last week that this was to “to ensure that user safety and privacy would be protected.”&nbsp;That decision is even more consequential, according to Messing. “The model that drives the most important part of the algorithm has not been open-sourced,” he tells me. “So the most important part of the algorithm is still inscrutable.”</p><p>Musk’s original motivation to make the algorithm open source seemed to stem from his belief that Twitter had used the algorithm to suppress free speech. “One of the things that I believe Twitter should do is open source the algorithm and make any changes to people's tweets — if they're emphasized or de-emphasized —that action should be made apparent,” Musk said last April in an appearance <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-twitter-ted-181607962.html"><ins>at TED</ins></a> shortly after he confirmed his takeover bid. “So anyone can see that action has been taken, so there's no sort of behind-the-scenes manipulation, either algorithmically or manually.”</p><p>But none of the code Twitter released tells us much about  potential bias or the kind of “behind-the-scenes manipulation” Musk said he wanted to reveal. “It has the flavor of transparency,” Messing says. “But it doesn’t really give insight into what the algorithm is doing. It doesn't really give insight into why someone's tweets may be down-ranked and why others might be up-ranked.”</p><p>Messing also points out that Twitter’s recent API changes have essentially <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2023/04/among-all-of-his-mistakes-dont-forget-elon-musk-is-singlehandedly-crushing-a-big-chunk-of-internet-research-for-no-good-reason/"><ins>cut off</ins></a> the vast majority of researchers from accessing a meaningful amount of Twitter data. Without proper API access, researchers are unable to conduct their own audits, which <em>would</em> be able to provide new details about how the algorithm works. “So at the same time Twitter is releasing this code, it’s made it incredibly difficult for research to <em>audit</em> this code,” he wrote in his own<a href="https://solomonmg.github.io/post/twitter-the-algorithm/"><ins> analysis</ins></a>.</p><p>Alex Hanna, director of research at the Distributed AI Research Institute (DAIR) also raised the importance of audits when we talked last year, shortly after Musk first discussed plans to “open source” Twitter’s algorithm. Like Messing, she was skeptical that simply releasing code on GitHub would meaningfully increase transparency into how Twitter works.</p><p>&quot;If you're actually interested in public oversight on something like a Twitter algorithm, then you would actually need multiple methods for oversight to happen” Hanna said.</p><p>There is one aspect of Twitter’s algorithm that the GitHub code does shed some new light on, though. Messing points to a file <a href="https://twitter.com/jeff4llen/status/1641901988047626241"><ins>unearthed</ins></a> by data scientist Jeff Allen, which reveals a kind of “formula” for how different types of engagement are given priority by the algorithm. “If we take that at face value, a fav (twitter like) is worth half a retweet,” Messing writes. “A reply is worth 27 retweets, and a reply with a response from a tweet’s author is worth a whopping 75 retweets.”</p><p>While that’s somewhat revealing, it’s, once again, an <a href="https://twitter.com/SolomonMg/status/1642154005588504577"><ins>incomplete</ins></a> picture of what’s actually happening. “It doesn't mean that much without the actual data,” Messing says. “And Musk just made data so insanely expensive for academics to get. If they want to actually study this now, you basically have to get a giant, massive grants — half a million dollars a year — to get a meaningful amount of data to study what's happening.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/what-did-twitters-open-source-algorithm-actually-reveal-not-a-lot-194652809.html?src=rss

<p>T-Mobile and Major League Baseball (MLB) are renewing their partnership. In addition to sponsoring various pro-baseball events, the carrier <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=450bac9f-8d9e-40ec-875c-2beb29a6147c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=T-Mobile&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0NTBiYWM5Zi04ZDllLTQwZWMtODc1Yy0yYmViMjlhNjE0N2MiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudC1tb2JpbGUuY29tL25ld3MvdW4tY2Fycmllci9tbGItcmVuZXdhbC0yMDIzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiMjAyYTZiNS0yZjQxLTRkMTYtYTkxNC0yZDEwMjMzOGU2Y2QifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQQRCGdnTcAP5N6zLUzmbpGkORuCLYzyHfLY5jRL5m2W&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fun-carrier%2Fmlb-renewal-2023">announced</a> today that its subscribers would continue receiving free MLB.TV subscriptions through 2028.</p><p>MLB and T-Mobile have offered the deal for the past eight years as part of its T-Mobile Tuesdays promotion, which gives subscribers access to weekly discounts and freebies. MLB.TV lets you stream home and away broadcast feeds around the league — live or on-demand. (However, it’s subject to dreaded regional blackouts, so you shouldn’t count on it to watch teams nearby.) In addition, for the first time this season, the service lets you stream minor-league games for your favorite major-league team’s affiliates in the MLB app.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Speaking of the minor leagues, the two corporations are partnering on an automated ball-strike (ABS) system, which lets Minor League Baseball (MiLB) players and officials “review, challenge and analyze calls.” This season, T-Mobile will power the system with a “5G Private Mobile Network” during some minor-league games. You may recall that MLB has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/major-league-baseball-targets-robot-umpires-for-balls-and-strikes-by-2024-091153970.html">experimenting</a> with robot umps in the independent <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-11-robot-umpire-balls-and-strikes-atlantic-league-game.html">Atlantic League since 2019</a>. Last year, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said the league aims to introduce the system to the big leagues by 2024. From a labor perspective, it’s hard not to see this as a first step toward automating umpires’ jobs, but at least fans can direct their vitriol over (perceived) bad calls to a machine instead of a human.&nbsp;</p><p>T-Mobile says its baseball partnership will also include a little-league sponsorship, part of which consists of the carrier donating millions of dollars toward equipment and grants for aspiring young sluggers. It’s also continuing to sponsor the All-Star Week <a href="https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-mlb-home-run-derby-5g-player-cameras-142640402.html">Home Run Derby</a> and batting practice broadcast. Finally, T-Mobile plans to expand its 5G coverage in baseball stadiums across North America, envisioning eventual “immersive 5G-connected experiences for fans” and better in-stadium speeds and reception for its subscribers.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-extends-free-mlbtv-deal-for-subscribers-through-2028-182807920.html?src=rss

## Researchers built sonar glasses that track facial movements for silent communication

<p>A Cornell University researcher has <a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2023/04/ai-equipped-eyeglasses-can-read-silent-speech">developed sonar glasses</a> that “hear” you without speaking. The eyeglass attachment uses tiny microphones and speakers to read the words you mouth as you silently command it to pause or skip a music track, enter a passcode without touching your phone or work on CAD models without a keyboard.</p><p>Cornell Ph.D. student Ruidong Zhang developed the system, which builds off a similar project the team created using a wireless earbud — and models before that which relied on cameras. The glasses form factor removes the need to face a camera or put something in your ear. “Most technology in silent-speech recognition is limited to a select set of predetermined commands and requires the user to face or wear a camera, which is neither practical nor feasible,” said Cheng Zhang, Cornell assistant professor of information science. “We’re moving sonar onto the body.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The researchers say the system only requires a few minutes of training data (for example, reading a series of numbers) to learn a user’s speech patterns. Then, once it’s ready to work, it sends and receives sound waves across your face, sensing mouth movements while using a deep learning algorithm to analyze echo profiles in real time “with about 95 percent accuracy.”</p><figure><img alt="A pair of black-plastic-framed eyeglasses sitting upside down on a white surface. The frames have small circuit boards with tiny speakers and microphones attached below the lenses." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/c4c0d510-d499-11ed-aec7-7364efa3423a" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Ruidong Zhang / Cornell University</div></figure><p>The system does this while offloading data processing (wirelessly) to your smartphone, allowing the accessory to remain small and unobtrusive. The current version offers around 10 hours of battery life for acoustic sensing. Additionally, no data leaves your phone, eliminating privacy concerns. “We’re very excited about this system because it really pushes the field forward on performance and privacy,” said Cheng Zhang. “It’s small, low-power and privacy-sensitive, which are all important features for deploying new, wearable technologies in the real world.”</p><p>Privacy also comes into play when looking at potential real-world uses. For example, Ruidong Zhang suggests using it to control music playback controls (hands- and eyes-free) in a quiet library or dictating a message at a loud concert where standard options would fail. Perhaps its most exciting prospect is people with some types of speech disabilities using it to silently feed dialogue into a voice synthesizer, which would then speak the words aloud.</p><p>If things go as planned, you can get your hands on one someday. The team at Cornell’s Smart Computer Interfaces for Future Interactions (SciFi) Lab is exploring commercializing the tech using a Cornell funding program. They’re also looking into smart-glasses applications to track facial, eye and upper body movements. “We think glass will be an important personal computing platform to understand human activities in everyday settings,” said Cheng Zhang.</p><div id="bcdcc0d3891046a68388098ca2bee69f"></div>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/researchers-built-sonar-glasses-that-track-facial-movements-for-silent-communication-171508573.html?src=rss

<p>Some <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/tesla/"><ins>Tesla</ins></a> workers shared sensitive photos and videos captured by the cameras on owners' cars between each other for several years, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/tesla-workers-shared-sensitive-images-recorded-by-customer-cars-2023-04-06/"><em><ins>Reuters</ins></em></a>. Former employees told the outlet that colleagues shared the images in group chats and one-on-one communications between 2019 and last year.</p><p>One such video showed a Tesla driving at high speed before hitting a child on a bike, <em>Reuters </em>reported. Other footage included things like a nude man walking toward a vehicle. &quot;We could see them doing laundry and really intimate things. We could see their kids,&quot; one of the former employees said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Workers are said to have sent each other videos taken inside Tesla owners' garages, too. One clip reportedly showed a submersible white Lotus Esprit sub that appeared in the 1977 James Bond movie <em>The Spy Who Loved Me. </em>As it happens, Tesla CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-03-02-tesla-model-s-lotus-esprit-easter-egg.html"><ins>bought that vehicle a decade ago</ins></a>, suggesting that his employees were circulating footage that a vehicle captured inside his garage.</p><p>The image-sharing practice “was a breach of privacy, to be honest,&quot; one of the former employees said. &quot;And I always joked that I would never buy a Tesla after seeing how they treated some of these people.”</p><p><a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/autopilot"><ins>On its website</ins></a>, Tesla says each new vehicle it builds is equipped with eight external cameras.

They also enable the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-sentry-mode-live-view-091026473.html"><ins>Sentry Mode</ins></a> surveillance system that captures footage of people approaching a parked Tesla and other seemingly suspicious activity.</p><p>The company states in its <a href="https://www.tesla.com/en_ca/legal/privacy"><ins>customer privacy notice</ins></a> that it designed the camera system to protect user privacy. It says that even if owners opt in to share camera recordings with Tesla for &quot;fleet learning&quot; purposes, &quot;camera recordings remain anonymous and are not linked to you or your vehicle&quot; unless it receives the footage due to a safety event, such as a crash or an airbag deployment. Even so, one employee said it was possible for Tesla data labelers to see the location of captured footage on Google Maps.</p><p>Tesla does not have a communications department that can be reached for comment.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/tesla-employees-reportedly-shared-videos-captured-by-cameras-on-customers-cars-165703126.html?src=rss

<p>The puck-shaped audio remixing tool Stem Player by Kano started its life as a collaboration with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/donda-stem-player-kanye-west-kano-hands-on-150038410.html"><ins>controversial musician Kanye West</ins></a>, but it has expanded and partnered with the estate of deceased hip-hop legend J Dilla. Users will be able to <a href="https://www.stemplayer.com/artist/j-dilla"><ins>remix and rearrange J Dilla beats</ins></a> via an exclusive catalog of content selected by the producer’s mother, Ma Dukes.</p><p>The 20 songs added to Stem Player have never been officially released, so your arrangement could end up being the de facto standard. Unfortunately, there aren't any tracks from iconic J Dilla albums like <em>Donuts</em> and <em>Champion Sound</em>. The many legendary tracks he produced for other artists, like De La Soul and A Tribe Called Quest, are also not available on this platform. Rights and all of that.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There are other musicians involved with this update. Stem Player has announced some Flea and Salaam Remi tracks are available for remixing, though J Dilla is the guest of honor. To that end, the collection even includes a discussion about his legacy led by his mother. The company also announced it is working on a documentary about the producer and <a href="https://www.stemplayer.com/artist/j-dilla/stemplayer-skin">has released a green skin</a> for the Stem Player as a tribute.</p><p>For the uninitiated, the Stem Player is a puck-shaped device with physical controls to remix and rearrange audio tracks. In this context, “stems” refer to the basic tracks of a song, so you can use the device to change various attributes of each stem, such as volume. This gadget handles the actual raw and unmixed tracks from the artist. It does not use AI to separate each track after they are mixed. The end result? Better stems and more accurate controls.</p><div id="dc66dd96ac2f4b1a86982770f62fd798"></div><p>Kano has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/stem-projector-player-release-220025695.html">severed ties with beleaguered rapper Kanye West</a>, but it has added Ghostface Killah to the roster, prior to the J Dilla announcement. It has also recently released a <ins>projector used to remix visuals</ins>. The company has started crowdfunding to guarantee the release of future products, including a DIY headphone-building kit. All J Dilla tracks are available now, but you need a $200 Stem Player.

<p>If you've been looking to scoop up a new gaming laptop but a solitary screen doesn't quite cut the mustard, you should perhaps consider the ASUS ROG Zephyrus Duo 16. It's our current pick for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-laptops-172033838.html"><ins>best gaming laptop</ins></a> with dual displays. Best of all, it's on sale right now.

It's powered by an AMD Ryzen 9 6900HX CPU and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti GPU. The 32GB of DDR5 RAM should help ensure you can play most games without too many hitches. You'll have a decent volume of storage space for your games too, as this ASUS ROG Zephyrus Duo 16 has a 1TB SSD.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The internal specs aren't what make this gaming laptop stand out, though. It's that second screen that sits between the keyboard and the main display. The 14-inch ScreenPad Plus could be handy for productivity, allowing you to keep an eye on certain apps while keeping most of your focus on more important tasks up top.&nbsp;</p><p>It might help you keep tabs on the news, social media or a show you're watching while getting some work done. Or you might use it to keep Discord open while you play games or pull up a walkthrough on YouTube if you get stuck. Alternatively, you could use it to monitor your viewership stats while you stream your gameplay.</p><p>We gave the ASUS ROG Zephyrus Duo 16 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-rog-zephyrus-duo-16-review-when-two-screens-are-better-than-one-specs-price-120018789.html"><ins>a score of 86 in our review</ins></a>, which is certainly respectable. The device isn't all sunshine and roses, unfortunately. We felt that it's fairly bulky with high-pitched fans and an underwhelming battery life. The touchpad, which ASUS scuttled off to the right side of the keyboard, is a bit awkward too.

If you keep tabs on them at Amazon, however, you can sometimes snag them for $200, making them a much better buy.

The 20 percent discount is within a dollar of the lowest price we've ever seen on Apple's latest generation premium buds.

## The dos and don’ts of location sharing

<p>It’s easy to say “yes” when an app or website asks for your location data just to get past the pop-up and back to scrolling, but it pays to be thoughtful about who you share it with and why. More often than not, it's more information than apps and websites really need to know about you.</p><p>Like other kinds of personal information, location data is presented by companies as a trade-off: consumers willingly expose where they are, usually for a more convenient user experience; the companies in turn gather crucial intel about customers and, more often than not, resell that data to third-parties for additional profit. Those third parties, according to Cooper Quintin, a security researcher at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, can include data brokers and advertisers, as well as law enforcement, bounty hunters, journalists and just about anyone else with the money to purchase this information. It's one of the reasons we feel like our devices “listen” to us — they probably don't hear you telling a friend that you’ve been really craving fast food, but they do know that there’s a McDonald’s nearby, and will serve up an advertisement for its french fries.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Because there aren’t federal laws or regulations currently in place to fully protect consumer information, it falls on individual users to navigate how they want that information to be spread. As you install new apps, don’t blindly agree to share location data, even if you think you have nothing to hide. “It's better just not to generate it in the first place,” Quintin said.</p><p>Is there ever a good reason to share this sensitive data with a company? A good rule of thumb is to avoid giving out location information unless the app requires it to function, according to Megan Iorio, senior counsel and amicus director at the Electronic Privacy Information Center. A maps app might need it to give you real-time directions; food delivery apps probably can get by with a simple address. Websites may ask for location permissions to enable convenience features, like a weather service, but will generate the same results from a zip code at a much lower risk. Even with the caveat that sharing location data is unavoidable in some instances, Iorio cautioned that providing apps or sites blanket access is never a good idea. “If you wind up needing location services, then you'll figure that out after using the app, but maybe the best strategy is to just tell everybody no until you actually realize that you need it,” Iorio said.</p><p>It's also best practice to revoke location permissions for any apps or sites you no longer use, or may have enabled thoughtlessly in the past. You can see what apps use your location data by going into the settings of your smartphone and navigating to the location sharing tab, usually in the privacy and security settings of most devices. That will list all of the apps with access to your location information, and give options to toggle it on or off. <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N1cHBvcnQuYXBwbGUuY29tL2d1aWRlL2lwaG9uZS9jb250cm9sLXRoZS1sb2NhdGlvbi1pbmZvcm1hdGlvbi15b3Utc2hhcmUtaXBoM2RkNWY5YmUvaW9zIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlYmFlZWMyMy0wYTVkLTQ3NDktYmFhMC0xNzJlZjJiNDgyODIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAASbT8Eci48gETXaEpOtJ3amEaj6wL94NSVqGVSSmQ9AU&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.apple.com%2Fguide%2Fiphone%2Fcontrol-the-location-information-you-share-iph3dd5f9be%2Fios">Apple</a>, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f85e63cd-e13c-4f9d-991c-9fbaadede3ac&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Samsung+Electronics&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmODVlNjNjZC1lMTNjLTRmOWQtOTkxYy05ZmJhYWRlZGUzYWMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2Ftc3VuZy5jb20vbGF0aW5fZW4vc3VwcG9ydC9tb2JpbGUtZGV2aWNlcy9ob3ctdG8tYWN0aXZhdGUtbXktbG9jYXRpb24tYW5kLWNoYW5nZS1zZXR0aW5ncy1mb3ItbG9jYXRpb24tcGVybWlzc2lvbnMvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlYmFlZWMyMy0wYTVkLTQ3NDktYmFhMC0xNzJlZjJiNDgyODIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAY25dMxM57KbxQDAGO5eiEjE-3lYWfp-x2wn1rJf-gjA&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Flatin_en%2Fsupport%2Fmobile-devices%2Fhow-to-activate-my-location-and-change-settings-for-location-permissions%2F">Samsung</a>, <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3467281?hl=en">Google</a> and others all provide specific instructions on their websites.

## The best music streaming services in 2023
 - [https://www.engadget.com/best-music-streaming-service-130046189.html?src=rss](https://www.engadget.com/best-music-streaming-service-130046189.html?src=rss)

<p>It’s difficult to pinpoint the best music streaming service for everyone. Most of the popular options available today hit on the essentials: a giant and diverse library of music that you can access à la carte, sort into playlists, download for offline listening and play across multiple devices. Most are available for around the same price, too. That said, there are subtle yet significant differences in features and philosophy among them that can determine which will fit into your life best. To assist those thinking about trying a new music app, we’ve spent the past few months using most popular music streaming services simultaneously, testing their limits and seeing how they adapt to our input.</p><h2>Most well-rounded: Apple Music</h2><p></p><p>No music streaming service is perfect, but for many, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0MTMwZTJmMC1hMTRmLTRjNWUtYmRhYi1jZDUyYWM3ZDhlNzkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL2FwcGxlLW11c2ljLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNWJmOWExNjYtMWI0Ni00MTU2LWFkYTMtMjhmYTQzZmZiMTUyIn0&amp;signature=AQAAARD3y1YgVtvRlerqlh4WYfgG-aNkPj9yVyouxPguAbcZ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-music%2F">Apple Music</a> should get the closest to covering all of the necessary bases. It has a library of more than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-100-million-songs-175703163.html">100 million songs</a>, all of which are available in lossless streaming quality for no extra cost. Its user interface doesn’t make it <em>too</em> hard to get to your music library and strikes a balance between useful algorithmic recommendations and smartly curated content from actual people. It’s one of the few music streaming services that lets you upload your own music files and naturally it’s tightly integrated with Apple devices.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Apple Music’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Lossless_Audio_Codec">ALAC</a> files have a minimum resolution of 16-bit/44.1kHz, which is the same quality you’d hear from a CD. A smaller but still significant selection can stream at higher resolutions up to 24-bit/192kHz. A significant number of albums are also available in Dolby Atmos surround sound mixes, or “spatial audio.”</p><p>Lossless streaming isn’t a game-changer for most casual listeners. You need a decent set of wired headphones and an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-best-dac-for-lossless-high-resolution-music-iphone-android-160056147.html">external DAC</a> (or a good speaker system) to take full advantage, and the upgrade isn’t so stark that non-enthusiasts will care. That said, even if the difference is subtle, a lossless file <em>does</em> sound better than a more compressed one, particularly in the way it draws out higher-frequency sounds from cymbals, strings and the like.</p><figure><img alt="A screenshot of the Apple Music app on web browsers." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/bce53770-d3c5-11ed-bbff-39ca47df1c4f" style="height: 1440px; width: 2560px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><p>Spatial audio, on the other hand, is more of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-era-300-review-a-big-bet-on-spatial-audio-130053487.html">fun gimmick</a>: technologically impressive, yes, and sometimes genuinely immersive, but just as likely to make a record sound less natural.</p><p>Relative to other music streaming services, Apple Music’s UI is perfectly serviceable. In general, it emphasizes human curation more than peers like Spotify or YouTube Music. It’s not as great an emphasis as it used to be, and the home “Listen Now” tab can be a smorgasbord of hit-and-miss suggestions based on your recent listening history. Still, the service is littered with clever, editor-picked playlists. The default search page holds several different genre tabs, each of which holds relevant playlists, music videos and a typically spot-on list of “essential albums.” Artist pages often spotlight a group’s most essential works alongside playlists of “deep cuts,” artists that likely inspired them, artists that were influenced by them and so on.</p><p>Streaming radio stations are one of Apple Music’s biggest differentiators. There’s a regular rotation of shows that feature artist interviews and have a sort of pre-internet feel. The main tabs often make room to highlight new buzzy releases, and you can find top charts for different countries and cities. All of this gives Apple Music an air of taste, something that can help you find music but prioritizes a personal touch.</p><figure><img alt="A collage of screenshots for the Apple Music app on iOS." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/23a6e940-d3c6-11ed-9ef5-2989d4b3686c" style="height: 2436px; width: 3375px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><p>Beyond that, getting a simple view of your saved artists, albums, songs and playlists is uncomplicated. You can reliably search for tracks by lyrics, and there’s a great lyrics view for impromptu karaoke sessions. Creating playlists and downloading albums for offline listening is straightforward, and you can start a radio station from any song. While your imported music won’t be available in lossless quality, being able to upload music at all is a great boon for those with big iTunes libraries. Just note that you’re capped at 100,000 tracks that aren’t already available in the app.</p><p>If you enjoy classical music, Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-classical-is-now-available-globally-082516950.html">recently launched</a> an Apple Music Classical app that’s dedicated to the genre and comes included with most Apple Music plans. Booting those works into a separate app is somewhat cumbersome, though.</p><p>There are still some drawbacks. While Apple Music has apps for Android, Windows and web browsers, the <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/apple-music-preview/9PFHDD62MXS1">Windows app</a> is only available in a buggy “preview” form as of this writing and there’s no lossless streaming in a browser. It’s best used with Apple devices. There’s (bafflingly) no way to see a list of your “loved” songs in the mobile app. There’s no free tier or annual family plan, either, and the individual plan is $1 more a month than some competitors.</p><p><strong>Free tier</strong>: No<br /><strong>Individual plan</strong>: $11/month or $109/year<br /><strong>Family plan</strong>: $17/month (up to 6 members)<br /><strong>Voice plan</strong>: $5/month (only usable with Siri)<br /><strong>Student plan</strong>: $6/month</p><h2>Best for music discovery: Spotify</h2><p></p><p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/">Spotify</a> leans much harder on algorithmic suggestions than Apple Music, but having a giant treasure trove of user listening data for so many years has allowed the service to fine-tune its music recommendation engine. This is the main reason to consider it: No service is more accurate at reading the music you like and serving up worthwhile suggestions for other songs you might enjoy (even if its UI is arguably getting worse with every update). As the most popular music streaming app, it’s also available on a wide array of devices.</p><p>Spotify is particularly impressive at creating playlists. “Discover Weekly” is famously adept at digging up unheard tracks and artists that align with your tastes. “Release Radar” is similarly impressive at spotlighting new tracks from artists you follow and those with complementary sounds. A selection of “Daily Mix” playlists blend past likes with deeper cuts from artists in your library and similar songs from ones who aren’t, then sorts them by mood as much as genre. Based on what you’ve been playing, you may wake up to one mix that’s mostly upbeat electro, another marked by soaring indie rock, and another with spacey hip-hop. While its selections can be more hit-or-miss, a new “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotifys-niche-mixes-let-you-generate-personalized-playlists-for-almost-anything-220006705.html">Niche Mixes” feature</a> lets you search for a mood or genre and have the app generate a relevant playlist. Simply following the algorithm down its rabbit holes makes it easy to find something<em>&nbsp;</em>you can enjoy in just a few taps.</p><figure><img alt="A screenshot of the Spotify app on web browsers." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/7fc2eda0-d3c6-11ed-bdf9-f4c6df37c929" style="height: 1440px; width: 2560px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><p>That said, there are still a ton of human-curated playlists to peruse as well. Regularly updated lists like “Rap Caviar,” “New Music Friday” and “Viva Latino” may not be tailored specifically for you, but they’re clearly programmed by knowledgeable people in-tune with current trends. A huge range of less frequently updated playlists based on genres, eras and vibes give the same impression. There’s a human touch here; it’s just not emphasized as much as it is in Apple Music, so which you’ll prefer depends on how willing you are to let an algorithm lead the way.</p><p>Spotify’s interface isn’t bad, but some recent changes have made it harder to use. The home tab has rows of suggestions based on your recent listening history. I went through a big <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacht_rock">yacht rock</a> phase while researching this guide, for example, so my homepage became peppered with playlists like “Soft Rock Classics,” “All Out 70s,” and “Totally Stress Free.” It wasn’t all stuff like that, but the point is that the service will sensibly morph and adapt as your listening habits change.</p><p>Sorting and searching through your own library is relatively clean, and a playlist with all your liked songs is featured prominently in the “Playlists” section. There’s a useful lyrics view for sing-alongs. Search usually works as it should, letting you look up music by title, lyric, artist or even context like “workout” or “studying.”</p><figure><img alt="A collage of screenshots of the Spotify app for iOS." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/a4c85090-d3c6-11ed-bfbe-d1d8283e3ba1" style="height: 2436px; width: 3375px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><p>Making and sharing a playlist is a breeze. Artist pages aren’t as comprehensive as Apple Music’s, but they do include a list of upcoming tour dates, with links to tickets from sites like Songkick, AXS and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ticketmaster-live-nation-senate-judiciary-hearing-195504179.html">Ticketmaster</a>. The search tab has dedicated pages for various genres and vibes, from “Jazz” and “R&amp;B” to “In the car” and “League of Legends.” You can start a radio station from any track, too, though this might repeat songs over time.</p><p>Spotify has made a huge push into podcasts and audiobooks in recent years, snapping up exclusive deals with several popular shows along the way (for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-joe-rogan-publisher-or-platform-184538877.html">better or worse</a>). Some may find this convenient, but it makes the UI feel cluttered. A row with “Your shows” is displayed right at the top of the home tab, which includes not only the shows you’ve subscribed to, but annoyingly, ones you’ve recently put on just once. Apple Music and many others completely omit podcasts, so they’ll be less aggravating if you’d prefer your music app to focus solely on music.</p><p>On the mobile app, you can filter the home screen by music, podcasts and audiobooks, but Spotify <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-debuts-its-tiktok-style-music-discovery-feed-183359654.html">recently revamped</a> these to look more like TikTok-style feeds with huge, autoplaying suggestion cards. This may look fresh, but scrolling through an endless feed, one or two suggestions at a time, is not an efficient way to find content. Similarly, the prominently featured <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotifys-new-ai-dj-will-talk-you-through-its-recommendations-140052560.html">AI-powered DJ tool</a> is technically impressive but also has a tendency to make jarring jumps from genre to genre. It speaks to an app that may be putting a little <em>too</em> much emphasis on its algorithmic prowess.</p><figure><img alt="A collage of screenshots depicting the Spotify mobile app on iOS." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/ba523b10-d3c6-11ed-b7f8-68b0032fb3d9" style="height: 2436px; width: 3375px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><p>Spotify doesn’t offer lossless streaming, instead topping out at a relatively low 320Kbps bitrate using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorbis">Ogg Vorbis</a> format.

You’ll have to deal with ads, an even lower 160 Kbps bitrate, and limits on track skips and on-demand playback, but you can still listen to several personalized playlists and enjoy much of the library. For casual background listening, it may be enough.</p><p>While it doesn’t have a practical effect on your listening experience, Spotify is particularly <a href="https://www.headphonesty.com/2021/11/how-much-does-spotify-pay-per-stream/">terrible</a> when it comes to artist payouts. Some music workers have even launched <a href="https://www.unionofmusicians.org/justice-at-spotify">advocacy campaigns</a> seeking fairer compensation and greater transparency.

For $12 a month or $120 a year, this also removes ads from YouTube, lets you download videos for offline viewing and enables background playback. Those features alone are massive benefits if you’re a frequent YouTube user, and you get a full music service on top.</p><p>Even without the perk of ad-free YouTube, YouTube Music benefits from a close integration with the video platform.

Naturally, this integration also makes YouTube Music the best choice for music videos, which you can swap to with a single tap.</p><p>Because it’s wrangling so much material, however, YouTube Music’s UI can feel scattershot and overwhelming. Scrolling down the home page reveals a hodgepodge of recent listens, liked music, curated and community-generated playlists, “similar to” suggestions, radio stations, music videos, algorithmically personalized mixes, new releases and top charts. Searching for an artist may display community playlists and covers underneath more traditional results; it also tends to blend singles with full albums, and it doesn’t display albums in chronological order. Content originally hosted on YouTube won’t integrate with your library as neatly as standard material, either.</p><figure><img alt="A collage of screenshots depicting the YouTube Music app on iOS." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/25614e00-d3c7-11ed-adcf-48e1c3359acc" style="height: 2436px; width: 3375px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><p>That said, the sheer mass of suggestions make YouTube Music good at surfacing new music you might like, and its “Discover Mix” works nearly as well as Spotify’s Discover Weekly. A few buttons at the top of the app can filter the home page’s suggestions to suit different moods: Relax, Workout, Energize, Commute or Focus. You can start a radio station from any song, though we also found this to regurgitate previously liked tracks more than we’d prefer. You <a href="https://support.google.com/youtubemusic/answer/9716522?hl=en">can upload</a> up to 100,000 of your own music files, too, which’ll be available even if you aren’t a paid subscriber (these won’t affect the service’s recommendations, however).</p><p>YouTube Music lacks lossless streaming and tops out at a relatively low 256 Kbps bitrate, so it’s not for audio enthusiasts. There’s no dedicated desktop app, and while there is an ad-supported tier, it stops playback whenever you exit the app on a phone and maxes at a rough 128 Kbps bitrate. All of your playlists are limited to a maximum of 5,000 songs. Podcast support is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/podcasts-are-coming-to-youtube-music-201928472.html">on the way</a>, though as of this writing it’s unclear how that’ll look. Google also has a long history of <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">killing its own products</a>, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-play-music-shutdown-end-of-2020-150006046.html">this service’s predecessor</a>; we’d understand if that makes you skittish long-term, though the company seems committed to improving YouTube Music today.</p><p><strong>Free tier</strong>: Yes<br /><strong>Individual plan</strong>: $10/month or $100/year; also available as part of YouTube Premium subscription for $12/month or $120/year<br /><strong>Family plan</strong>: $15/month (up to 6 members)<br /><strong>Student plan</strong>: $5/month</p><h2>Another good option: Amazon Music Unlimited</h2><p></p><p><a href="https://music.amazon.com/">Amazon Music Unlimited</a> is a strong alternative to Apple Music and Spotify if you want podcasts and lossless streaming within the same app. Like Apple Music, it offers 100+ million songs in CD quality at no extra cost, with a smaller but ever-growing selection of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAC">FLAC</a> files available in “Ultra HD” (24-bit/192kHz). Various tracks are mixed in <a href="https://music.amazon.com/playlists/B081KSLWPF">Dolby Atmos</a> or <a href="https://music.amazon.com/playlists/B08F9DTNNG">Sony’s 360 Reality Audio</a> as well. Like Spotify, its catalog encompasses a wide selection of non-music content. Most of the major podcast networks are represented, and several shows are presented ad-free.</p><p>If you already subscribe to Amazon Prime, you can get Music Unlimited for less than its rivals, with an individual plan available for $9 a month or $89 a year. It’s not a massive discount, but $10 or $20 less each year isn’t nothing when the broad differences between music streaming services are so marginal. Naturally, Music Unlimited works the smoothest on Amazon’s fleet of Alexa devices as well.</p><figure><img alt="A collage of screenshots depicting the Amazon Music Unlimited app on iOS." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/637443f0-d3c7-11ed-99fe-767431a99cc2" style="height: 2436px; width: 3375px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><p>Music Unlimited’s UI is similar to its peers but has some annoyances. Amazon is more aggressive than Spotify when it comes to pushing podcasts that don’t align with your listening history. Radio stations and algorithmic playlists don’t display what songs are in the queue. Search isn’t as precise as the options above, and you can’t directly search through the saved albums on your library page. Amazon is also less proactive about surfacing new music you might like than Apple or Spotify. Even still, Music Unlimited delivers an impressive catalog for a potentially cut-rate price.</p><p><strong>Free tier</strong>: Yes<br /><strong>Individual plan</strong>: $11/month; $9/month or $89/year with Amazon Prime<br /><strong>Family plan</strong>: $16/month or $159/year (up to 6 members)<br /><strong>Single device plan</strong>: $5/month (for one Echo or Fire TV only)<br /><strong>Student plan</strong>: $6/month</p><h2>Honorable mentions</h2><figure><img alt="A collage of screenshots depicting the iOS apps for the music streaming services Tidal, Qobuz and Deezer, respectively" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/c1446850-d3c4-11ed-be72-b6bfbdb01edc" style="height: 2436px; width: 3375px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><h3>Tidal</h3><p><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8ab29eef-5263-4732-98de-bdf5034566d5&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=TIDAL&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4YWIyOWVlZi01MjYzLTQ3MzItOThkZS1iZGY1MDM0NTY2ZDUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly90aWRhbC5jb20vIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1YmY5YTE2Ni0xYjQ2LTQxNTYtYWRhMy0yOGZhNDNmZmIxNTIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAcO_9Rw_-exFlRZwBID-hRi5lDd8R3SsH7jFMCU4XSYD&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Ftidal.com%2F">Tidal</a> offers the <a href="https://www.headphonesty.com/2021/11/how-much-does-spotify-pay-per-stream/">highest royalty rates</a> for artists, CD-quality streaming at no extra cost, a free tier, a library of more than 100 million songs and an experience rich with human curation and feature-style content. If you’re a music nerd and determined to not give another monthly fee to a tech industry behemoth, it’s a good choice. Its apps aren’t <em>quite </em>as smooth as those from Apple Music, though, and its highest-resolution tier costs $20 a month. Those high-res tracks are also encoded in MQA, a partly lossy format that still sounds sharp but isn’t open-source like FLAC.</p><h3>Qobuz</h3><p><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=33b112ec-7f97-4b84-a88d-238616aeb732&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=qobuz&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzM2IxMTJlYy03Zjk3LTRiODQtYTg4ZC0yMzg2MTZhZWI3MzIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucW9idXouY29tL3VzLWVuL2Rpc2NvdmVyIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1YmY5YTE2Ni0xYjQ2LTQxNTYtYWRhMy0yOGZhNDNmZmIxNTIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZadWPoFDmcciZkUb4EFWHWSZa9oeWU8RgWd7fHWQq1-&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.qobuz.com%2Fus-en%2Fdiscover">Qobuz</a> is a favorite in audiophile circles, particularly when it’s paired with the <a href="https://roonlabs.com/">Roon</a> music player. Like Tidal, it downplays algorithmic discovery for a more considered, editorial-heavy approach. It offers up to 24-bit/192kHz FLAC streams and includes a digital music store for purchasing high-res downloads of various albums. It’s particularly attentive to classical music. But unless you want to avoid Apple or Amazon, you can get similarly high-quality streaming for a lower price. Some may also find the UI leans too hard on personal curation and requires too much effort to discover new music.</p><h3>Deezer</h3><p><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=41ab16ce-d6ae-441d-8e82-5d67b557b903&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Deezer&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0MWFiMTZjZS1kNmFlLTQ0MWQtOGU4Mi01ZDY3YjU1N2I5MDMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGVlemVyLmNvbS91cy8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjViZjlhMTY2LTFiNDYtNDE1Ni1hZGEzLTI4ZmE0M2ZmYjE1MiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAZtky6J4fDfjRbqQdXXZJ2IZO9asdiruNZ_hNoCuHqQe&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.deezer.com%2Fus%2F">Deezer</a> has an attractive interface, a competitive library, CD-quality streaming and the ability to <a href="https://support.deezer.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115004221605-Upload-MP3s-To-Your-Deezer-Account">upload your own</a> MP3 files to the service from a desktop.

<p>The six-part TV drama based on the story of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-11-the-pirate-bay-baystream-torrent-streaming.html">The Pirate Bay</a>, which was first <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-story-will-be-turned-into-a-tv-series-211110/">reported</a> in 2021, is going into production this fall, according to <a href="https://variety.com/2023/global/global/dynamic-television-svt-b-reel-films-1235575411/"><em>Variety</em></a>. It's being produced by B-Reel Films, the same production company behind <em>Midsommar</em>, and LA-based indie distribution firm Dynamic Television has just acquired the worldwide rights for it. Presumably, that means it will be released to audiences around the world — legally, that is, so people don't have to use websites like The Pirate Bay to get a copy of the series.&nbsp;</p><p>Before streaming services became widely available, a lot of people took to the high seas to download shows that din't air in their home countries or movies they missed in the theaters. The Pirate Bay, a BitTorrent index that allowed users to contribute magnet links others can access, was perhaps the most common first stop for internet users looking for content back then.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Head writer Piotr Marciniak described the series as &quot;a classic rise and fall story, a tragedy about flying too close to the sun, but also a timeless story of a generational conflict.&quot; It will apparently tell a character-driven tale focused on co-founders Peter Sunde, Fredrik Neij, and Gottfrid Swartholm who established the website as anti-copyright activists. Eventually, they found themselves Hollywood's enemy number 1, chased by anti-piracy agents, lawyers and the Interpol until they were found guilty of assisting in copyright infringement and sentenced to prison.&nbsp;</p><p>As for what viewers can expect, director Jens Sjögren said:</p><p>&quot;We are thrown between the driving perspectives – quick cuts between the basement full of computers to the conference rooms of Hollywood, from the offices in Washington via the concern felt at government offices in Stockholm, to meetings with financiers at Lake Geneva and then finally we’re back in the safety of the basement. A full throttle journey infused with paranoia, humor and deadly serious technical, emotional and political challenges.&quot;</p><p>The show doesn't have a release date yet, but Dynamic will share more details about it at the MIPTV Media Market event in Cannes on April 17th to 19th.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-pirate-bay-tv-drama-goes-into-production-this-fall-120524996.html?src=rss

## Pichai: Google will add GPT-style conversational AI to search

<p>After getting beat to the punch by its primary rival, Google plans to add conversational AI to its flagship Search product, CEO Sundar Pichai told <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2f007401-3eaa-4237-b69b-54ccbe125502&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Wall+Street+Journal&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyZjAwNzQwMS0zZWFhLTQyMzctYjY5Yi01NGNjYmUxMjU1MDIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9nb29nbGUtY2VvLXN1bmRhci1waWNoYWktc2F5cy1zZWFyY2gtdG8tZmVhdHVyZS1jaGF0LWFpLTJmYTBmNTRjIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhZjFjZGVmZS1iNzc4LTRhMzctODNlOC05ZTljZDEwNmJmMDcifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAYxg7yD6le76BMm2enKFi9psK7deRGkhMLyIYSnTG0EF&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Fgoogle-ceo-sundar-pichai-says-search-to-feature-chat-ai-2fa0f54c"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> in an interview. "Will people be able to ask questions to Google and engage with LLMs [large language models] in the context of search? Absolutely," he said. Google has <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/try-bard/">already said</a> it would integrate LLMs into search, but this is the first time the company has announced plans for conversational features.</p><p>The move isn't unexpected, particularly after Microsoft released a version of its own Bing search engine that used OpenAI's ChatGPT AI engine. However, Google's implementation would potentially have more impact, considering its 93.4 percent worldwide share of the search market. Pichai added that he saw AI chat as a way to expand its search business, rather than a threat. "The opportunity space, if anything, is bigger than before," he told the <em>WSJ</em>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Pichai didn't reveal a timeline for chat AI search, but it's clear that Google lags behind Microsoft. OpenAI's release of ChatGPT prompted Google to declare a "<a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjODEzYWUzOS03ZDU4LTQxY2ItYWM2Ni1hZDgzMDYwNmNlZWYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi8yMS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L2FpLWNoYXRncHQtZ29vZ2xlLXNlYXJjaC5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhZjFjZGVmZS1iNzc4LTRhMzctODNlOC05ZTljZDEwNmJmMDcifQ&amp;signature=AQAAATNIKAlRlQYZrZNZULCtd4jiw89SXPzRez1cp-aN8YK0&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2022%2F12%2F21%2Ftechnology%2Fai-chatgpt-google-search.html">code red</a>" as it saw the AI as an existential threat to its core business. That proved to be warranted, as Microsoft (which owns a large chunk of OpenAI), soon released a version of Bing Search powered by OpenAI's latest GPT 4 model that gave it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-new-bing-edge-ai-copilot-hands-on-demo-test-chatgpt-openai-213332455.html">some uncanny abilities</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Google released its own conversational AI called Bard strictly as a chat product on a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-is-opening-up-access-to-its-bard-ai-chatbot-today-140047434.html">standalone site</a> and not in Search. However, it was clearly lagging behind ChatGPT, displaying <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-bard-chatbot-false-information-twitter-ad-165533095.html">incorrect answers</a> in a Twitter ad. Pichai <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-bard-is-switching-to-a-more-capable-language-model-ceo-confirms-133028933.html">recently said</a> Google would soon switch to a more "capable" language model in an effort to close the gap.&nbsp;</p><p>While Google is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-parent-alphabet-is-laying-off-12000-employees-105523115.html">cutting jobs</a> in an effort to achieve Pichai's goal of becoming 20 percent more productive, the company is accelerating work on new AI products. To be more efficient, it plans to allow more collaboration between divisions like Google Brain and DeepMind, its two primary AI units. "Expect a lot more, stronger collaboration, because some of these efforts will be more compute-intensive, so it makes sense to do it at a certain scale together," he said.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/pichai-google-will-add-gpt-style-conversational-ai-to-search-104200594.html?src=rss

## Google will soon restrict loan apps from accessing users' photos and contacts

<p>Google will implement a new rule for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/kenya-digital-lending-app-regulation-211709862.html">apps providing personal loans</a> starting on May 31st that could help protect users from abuse and harassment. The tech giant has <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/13161491">updated its policy</a> (via <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/05/google-personal-loan-apps-update/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a>) to prohibit cash lending applications from being able to access users' contacts list. They will no longer be able to access people's photos and videos, as well, whether they're saved on the phone itself or an external storage.&nbsp;</p><p>This is but one of the changes Google has implemented over the past year, following multiple reports of harassment from certain markets, such as India, Pakistan, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/kenya-digital-lending-app-regulation-211709862.html">Kenya</a> and the Philippines. It's common for loan apps to require access to users' phonebooks and media before they lend money. The fact that people can easily install these apps on their phones makes them look like a pretty convenient solution for sudden monetary issues. But since they typically charge exorbitant interest rates, a lot of borrowers end up having difficulties keeping up with payments. That's when the abuse begins.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Agents for these services would mass send profanity-laden texts to all the borrower's contacts, including random acquaintances and co-workers, in an attempt to humiliate them into paying. Some would even go as far as to threaten them and their family bodily harm. As <em>TechCrunch</em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/26/loan-apps-abuse-harassment-suicide-indian-users-google-apple-india/">previously reported</a>, the abuse got so bad for some people that it had driven them to suicide.&nbsp;</p><p>In an attempt to keep these loan sharks under control, Google implemented rules for India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Nigeria, Kenya, and Pakistan, requiring them to submit proof of approval and other documentation from the appropriate government agencies. In the US, Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-12-google-bans-payday-loan-apps-in-play-store.html">banned payday loan apps</a> with an annual percentage rate of 36 percent or higher way back in 2019. And in Pakistan, non-banking financial institutions will only be allowed to publish one lending app on the Play Store starting on May 31st.</p><p>The tech giant tightened its screening measures for lending apps <a href="https://www.rappler.com/business/google-tightens-screening-lending-apps-curb-loan-sharks/">a year ago</a> in the Philippines, where I live. I still see an enormous number of loan apps when I look at the Play Store, though, and still regularly hear stories about users being hounded by their agents. Clearly, the stricter screening rules weren't enough, but Google blocking these application from accessing people's phonebooks sounds like a step in the right direction.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-will-soon-restrict-loan-apps-from-accessing-users-photos-and-contacts-100906959.html?src=rss
