Nintendo's been pretty stingy with the details it's given out on The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, but it did, to be fair, reveal a pretty extensive demonstration of the highly anticipated sequel recently, showcasing over 10 minutes of new gameplay footage.

Road 96: Mile 0 doesn’t set out to expand the gameplay that made the original so unique. It instead seeks to flesh out the world through a smaller, more intimate story that tugs on your heartstrings.
