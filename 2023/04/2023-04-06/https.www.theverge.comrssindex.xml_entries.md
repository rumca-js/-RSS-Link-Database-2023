  <p id="oGCQFQ">Writers trying to embed tweets in their Substack stories are in for a rude surprise: after pasting a link to the site, a message pops up saying that “Twitter has unexpectedly restricted access to embedding tweets in Substack posts” and explaining that the company is working on a fix. The unfortunate situation comes on the heels of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/5/23670452/substack-notes-tweets-posts-twitter">Substack announcing Notes, a Twitter competitor</a>.</p>

<p id="5aPvI6">There’s been hype around Global Thermostat since it got started in 2010 as one of just three high-profile<strong> </strong>companies in the world developing this technology, called direct air capture (DAC).

With the soundboard, you’ll be able to play all sorts of sounds in voice channels to have some fun or troll a friend. The feature was previously <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/12612888127767-Soundboard-FAQ">an experiment</a> available to a limited amount of communities, but it will now be rolling out over “the coming weeks,” according to a Discord blog post.</p>
<p id="DQCWkc">There is a catch, though: you’ll only be able to actually make sounds with Discord’s soundboard on the desktop app. If you’re on mobile, you’ll hear the sounds but can’t use the board yourself, Kellyn Sloane, director of product communications, tells <em>The Verge</em>. That said, any official Discord soundboard is still an improvement, as you’ve previously had...</p>

## Motorola’s big-battery budget phone gets 5G and a price hike

  <p id="03jFJe">The 2023 version of Motorola’s all-about-battery-life Moto G Power trades some of that battery life for modern conveniences. In addition to 5G, a nicer screen and more powerful processor are on offer, so Moto’s battery claims aren’t as lofty this year, and the price is higher. While last year’s 128GB model sold for $249, this year’s edition starts at $299. Still, it might make for a budget phone that’s worth buying. </p>
<p id="KPidfd">Along with a huge 5,000mAh battery, the Motorola Moto G Power 5G (Lord help me; that is actually the full product name) includes a MediaTek Dimensity 930 processor with 4GB of RAM. By the looks of it, that should be a serious upgrade from the 4G-only Helio G37 chip in the 2022 Moto G Power, which, by <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/motorola-moto-g-power-2022-review-3070286/">several accounts</a>, <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/moto-g-power-2022">stank</a>....</p>

  <p class="p--has-dropcap" id="d7ftnD">In July 2022, the world watched with bated breath as Twitter sued Elon Musk. No one knew whether the deal was going to happen or whether it had all been an elaborate troll to begin with. (The two weren’t mutually exclusive, either.) Billions of dollars and the fate of a major worldwide social media network hung in the balance. The lawsuit was, in some ways, unprecedented. Legal experts found themselves besieged with all kinds of tricky questions. </p>

  <p id="gB1u2z"><em>Minecraft Legends</em> is a strategy spinoff of <em>Minecraft </em>— but it might also be the next competitive multiplayer craze. I had a chance to spend a few hours with the game last month <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23647882/gdc-2023-game-developer-conference-news-announcements-interviews">at GDC in San Francisco</a>, and while it seems like it has a solid campaign to dig into, I had <em>a lot</em> more fun with the team-based multiplayer. It’s kind of like <em>Minecraft</em> mashed with <em>League of Legends</em> and <em>StarCraft</em>, and in the one match I played, it involved a lot of yelling (in a good way).</p>
<p id="gRfLZk"><em>Legends</em> is built on the same “bedrock” engine as the main <em>Minecraft</em> game, and the two look pretty much identical. You control a blocky little character running through a similarly blocky world. The difference here is what you’re doing. To get acclimated, I first played around two...</p>

  <p id="aSpYU7">Microsoft is planning to add its new Microsoft 365 Copilot assistant to OneNote. The software giant <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/16/23642833/microsoft-365-ai-copilot-word-outlook-teams">originally announced Copilot</a> for apps like Teams, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint last month, and it’s now ready to demo how note taking will be impacted by an AI-powered assistant.</p>
<p id="yDrnvT">“As your notetaking partner, Copilot uses your prompts to draft plans, generate ideas, create lists, organize information, and more,” <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/onenote-your-digital-notebook-reimagined-with-copilot/ba-p/3788442">explains Greg Mace</a>, a product manager for OneNote.</p>

  <p id="zXSOht">Microsoft has added Bing Chat AI to its popular SwiftKey keyboard for Android. The integration started appearing on Wednesday and allows SwiftKey Beta users to quickly access Microsoft’s Bing chatbot at the tap of a button in any app.</p>
<p id="3G8XUu">The Bing Chat integration inside SwiftKey includes the usual chat mode that offers access to the chatbot, or a tone mode that will rewrite any text right within the keyboard. If you were only using the Bing mobile app to access the chatbot, this new integration makes that app rather redundant if, instead, you’re willing to install and use SwiftKey everywhere.</p>
<p id="oH2h3w">To access this new Bing Chat integration you’ll need to download the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.touchtype.swiftkey.beta&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US">beta version of SwiftKey on the Google Play Store</a>. Pedram Rezaei, Microsoft’s CTO...</p>

  <p id="KMnAhE">Sypra has made a name for itself by creating powerful, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22457616/spyra-two-water-gun-toy-pool-not-crowdfunded">electronic water guns,</a> the first of which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/8/10/17674496/spyra-one-water-gun-digital-ammo-counter-usb-c-kickstarter">launched on Kickstarter in 2018</a>.

<p id="MX1PbG">Before we get to those, let’s go over what makes the Spyra more than just your standard Super Soaker — and why it can command its eye-popping price tag of $179.00 <em>per gun</em>. Like the SpyraTwo (which you can <a href="https://spyra.com/products/spyratwo?variant=39538035687600">still buy for around $5 less</a>), the SpyraThree features an electronic firing system that can spray people from around 30 feet away, and can send water almost 50 feet when you charge up a...</p>
