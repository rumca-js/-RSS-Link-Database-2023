Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nA new branch titled \"newvegas2\" was added to Fallout 4's backend, and was made visible to players after an update on April 4. Think of software and game development like a tree. The trunk is the game itself, and developers can create branches from that trunk to work off of without tampering with the actual project, or stepping on the work of another developer.\n\nSince this \u201cnewvegas2\u201d branch is connected to the trunk of Fallout 4, the speculation is that the game\u2019s next gen update, that was announced last fall with an intended launch sometime this year, will feature new content around New Vegas. Specifically, content featured in Creators Club third party mods initially developed by fans.\n\nWhile the branch has since been either deleted or properly hidden from users, that hasn\u2019t stopped people online from speculating about a New Vegas sequel. Considering that Microsoft now owns the IP holder of Fallout, Bethesda, and the developers of the original New Vegas, Obsidian, the company has literally all the pieces to make a New Vegas 2. There\u2019s even interest from involved parties to do so, with head of Obsidian Feargus Urquhart telling Gamepressure in January, \"Of course, if we ever got the opportunity to make another Fallout game, we'd make it.\"\n\nUnfortunately for New Vegas fans, Urquhart confirmed in the same interview that Obsidian does not currently have a Fallout game in development, lending further credence to the theory that the mysterious \"newvegas2\" branch is strictly related to an upcoming Fallout 4 update, and likely unrelated to a remake or sequel of Obsidian's 2010 RPG. \n\nGoing back to yesterday\u2019s PlayStation handheld rumors, which made mention the device would include controls akin to a DualSense controller with haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, it seems the company might take things to a completely other level with a potential DualSense 2, with a new patent application that suggests Sony is looking to implement temperature feedback into its controllers.\n\nThe company has filed a patent application for a material that can simulate temperature feedback to its controllers in order to reflect what is going on during gameplay. The controller would feature a malleable membrane for its exterior rather than the hard plastic of traditional controllers. \n\nNot only could this membrane change shape based on what was occurring in the game, but an electrical current could pass through it in order for the user to feel a simulated change in temperature. This material would also allow for better, more precise haptic feedback than the current material of the DualSense.\n\nWhile this all sounds cool in practice, what I\u2019d rather simply have Sony invent is a DualSense controller with decent battery life.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djGycTXNxec", "date_published": "2023-04-06 21:00:23+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Trepang2 | Official Release Date Reveal Gameplay Trailer", "description": "Trepang2 features high-octane, first-person gun-fu gunplay and puts players in the shoes of a newly enhanced super soldier on a mission of death, destruction, and revenge.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyMTsmkgeTI", "date_published": "2023-04-06 14:14:59+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Dreamhack San Diego 2023 Main Stage with GameSpot, Giantbomb, and Fandom Day 3", "description": "Tune in for day 3 of Dreamhack San Diego with GameSpot, Giantbomb, and Fandom. \n\nSunday 10am - 3pm\n10AM PT - Giantbomb Voicemail Dump Truck Live Podcast - Dan/Ryckert maybe Emma/Bailey\n12PM PT Are you Smarter than a Games Journalist Trivia/Quiz - Emma Fyffe and Bailey Meyers hosting with Dan Ryckert and Jeff Grubb competing against audience\n1PM Mario Maker Madness - Hosts Emma Fyffe and Dave Klein the evil mastermind behind the Mario Maker levels that - Dan Ryckert, Jeff Grubb and Bailey Meyers have to play through\n2PM Fandom Presents the VA of God of War Panel - Hosts Bailey + Emma\n\n#dreamhack #gamespot #giantbomb #fandom", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOaewIO5BE0", "date_published": "2023-04-06 00:30:40+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Dreamhack San Diego 2023 Main Stage with GameSpot, Giantbomb, and Fandom Day 2", "description": "Tune in on Saturday April 8th, as GameSpot, Giantbomb, and Fandom host a Mario 64 Tennis Tournament and a Cozy Gaming session at Dreamhack San Diego 2023.
