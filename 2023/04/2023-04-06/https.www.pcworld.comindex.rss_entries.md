<p>Modern times call for modern apps. For Outlook, Microsoft started taking slow steps last year toward a full overhaul with the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/702533/you-can-officially-try-out-microsofts-new-outlook-client-right-now.html">preview release of new Outlook software</a>. Available to Microsoft 365 Insider preview members, the early versions restricted users to just one account&mdash;and it had to be one that fell under the Microsoft umbrella.</p>



<p>But <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://insider.office.com/en-us/blog/starting-to-support-third-party-accounts-in-new-outlook-for-windows-preview&amp;xcust=2-1-1751794-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">as announced in an Insider blog post</a>, the company has now begun rolling out third-party email support, starting with Gmail. Full calendar and contact support will be integrated at last, too. It&rsquo;s a major upgrade from the current Outlook experience, which can only connect to your Google email. Support for Yahoo and iCloud will soon follow.</p>



<p>Insiders who already have the new Outlook for Windows app installed can try adding a Gmail account to see if the feature is live for them. If not, Microsoft says to expect a call out when your turn arrives. Should you not already be an Insider and want to get in on the fun, you can sign up by following <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://insider.office.com/en-us/join/windows&amp;xcust=2-1-1751794-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Microsoft&rsquo;s instructions</a>.</p>



<p>Also launching alongside third-party email support are writing and management tools for the app, like polls, delayed sending, and pinned email. The app&rsquo;s calendar also gets multiple shared calendars, support for multiple time zones, and daily weather info. Expect more familiar features down the road too (like offline support) as yet more flesh and skin get layered onto the new Outlook&rsquo;s skeleton.</p>

## Seagate’s Lightsaber drives are elegant SSDs for a more civilized age

<p>Remember when Seagate made <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/793473/seagate-beskar-ingot-ssd-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">special edition storage drives made from &ldquo;Beskar steel,&rdquo;</a> that stuff Boba Fett and other Mandalorians wear to make them <s>incredibly marketable</s> impervious to plasma blasters? Well the company&rsquo;s back with its Star Wars-flavored PC hardware, and this time it&rsquo;s even shinier. The new <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.seagate.com/products/gaming-drives/special-editions/lightsaber-collection-nvme-ssd/&amp;xcust=2-3-1711467-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">&ldquo;Lightsaber Collection&rdquo; FireCuda M.2 SSDs</a> come with swappable faceplates that light up with Kyber-infused LEDs, igniting your weapon of choice and illuminating your PC case with the power of Disney merchandising. </p>



<p>The drives are PCIe 4.0 SSDs offering speeds of up to 7300 MB/s, which <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394957/seagate-firecuda-530-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">matches the blistering FireCuda 530 we reviewed back in 2021</a>. But of course, with something like this the specs are a secondary consideration. What you want is to see those laser swords fire up. The 1TB and 2TB drives come with removable faceplates, with the likeness of the signature weapons of Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, and Obi-Wan Kenobi in a 3D mold. Naturally, Luke and Obi-Wan&rsquo;s plates glow blue and Vader&rsquo;s glows red &mdash; sorry, Mace Windu fans, better luck next May. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Seagate Darth Vader SSD" class="wp-image-1713804" height="1200" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/71QGsZ-dWqL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Seagate</p></div>



<p>The 1TB Lightsaber Edition drive goes for $185, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BQTP6VP1&amp;xcust=2-3-1711467-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">while the 2TB model is a hefty $290</a>. That&rsquo;s about $75-85 above the street price of the regular FireCude 530 drives. But can you really put a price on the satisfaction you feel knowing that your PC&rsquo;s storage proclaims your love of Star Wars to the world, and is officially licensed by LucasArts? </p>



<p>Well yeah, obviously you can. The price is $75, as that&rsquo;s the premium these Star Wars-themed drives command over their more earthly FireCuda cousins. </p>

## Counter-Strike 2 will use Nvidia Reflex to assassinate latency
 - [https://www.pcworld.com/article/1708610/counter-strike-2-uses-nvidia-reflex-to-assassinate-latency.html](https://www.pcworld.com/article/1708610/counter-strike-2-uses-nvidia-reflex-to-assassinate-latency.html)

<p>In the world of online shooters, blaming latency for your death is only slightly less popular than blaming hackers when you get killed five times in a row by the same [censored] on the other side of the server. But in Valve&rsquo;s highly-anticipated <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, you&rsquo;ll have one less option when it comes time to apologize to your teammates&mdash;assuming you&rsquo;re using an Nvidia graphics card, anyway. The upcoming game will use Nvidia Reflex to apply graphics card power to reduce latency and increase responsiveness. </p>



<p>Reflex is a fascinating little bit of software. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393646/tested-how-nvidia-reflex-can-make-you-a-better-esports-gamer.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">It&rsquo;s an end-to-end SDK made with esports in mind</a>, which reduces the time between when a player&rsquo;s input on the mouse and keyboard goes from the CPU to the GPU, and then gets displayed on the monitor as a gameplay effect. With a shortened render queue, the CPU can sample mouse, keyboard, and controller inputs at the last possible millisecond, resulting in a dramatically reduced gap between the time when you make a click and when your in-game character fires. </p>



<p>This is a complex, end-to-end process, and it can&rsquo;t simply be added to any game. Game developers need to take advantage of the Reflex SDK in order for players to see the result, something that&rsquo;s already happened in manyof the most popular online multiplayer shooters, including <em>Fortnite </em>and <em>Valorant. Counter-Strike GO </em>does not support Reflex, which is why it&rsquo;s notable that <em>CS2</em> will do it right out of the gate, according to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393646/tested-how-nvidia-reflex-can-make-you-a-better-esports-gamer.html">a report </a><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/6/23672408/counter-strike-2-nvidia-reflex-feature&amp;xcust=2-1-1708610-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">by </a><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393646/tested-how-nvidia-reflex-can-make-you-a-better-esports-gamer.html">The Verge</a>. Nvidia claims that Reflex can reduce latency by as much as 35 percent, especially on older graphics cards. </p>



<p>The results will be felt most on setups with decent power and a high-speed monitor, 120Hz at the very least. You&rsquo;ll also need an Nvidia graphics card, but an expensive new GPU isn&rsquo;t necessary &mdash; Reflex will work on cards as old as the GeForce GTX 900 series from 2014. That&rsquo;s a big deal, as<em> Counter-Strike GO</em> remains a popular online game for players who don&rsquo;t have the most recent hardware. </p>

## Nab this vibrant everyday IPS monitor for just $77

<p>Sometimes all you need is a basic monitor to get the job done. No frills, just solid specs and a screen that&rsquo;s sharp enough for work or personal use. That&rsquo;s where we (mostly me) come swooping in with an epic deal in tow. Monoprice is selling its CrystalPro IPS business monitor for just <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=44029&amp;AID&amp;xcust=2-1-1703518-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">$76.49 with the promo code YAY15</a> at checkout. That&rsquo;s a savings of $73.50 and a flat-out fantastic price for a high-definition monitor&mdash;and it comes with free shipping, too. Even better, this budget stunner uses an IPS panel, rather than a washed-out TN screen like you find on many ultra-affordable displays. IPS panels provide the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/535837/monitor_buying_guide.html">most accurate colors and wide viewing angles</a>.</p>



<p>The 24-inch CrystalPro has a resolution of 1920&times;1080, a refresh rate of 75Hz, that juicy IPS panel, and a one year warranty. The warranty covers a replacement if the monitor develops any dead pixels. The display is also VESA compatible, which means you can attach the monitor to other monitor stands, desk mounts, and so on. That&rsquo;s helpful if you plan on buying two or three of these cheap, crisp panels and configuring them in a multi-monitor setup for enhanced productivity. There&rsquo;s also a high speed HDMI cable thrown in the box. </p>



<p>But really, all we had to say is &ldquo;IPS monitor for $77.&rdquo; This is a killer deal. You better get it now before it&rsquo;s gone forever.</p>

<p>OLED monitors are all the rage in 2023&mdash;but, to the disappointment of everyday shoppers, they remain expensive. Even portable OLED monitors are typically priced above $300. But while the Innocn 15K1F&rsquo;s MSRP rings in at $399.99, it can be found for significantly less on Amazon ($269.99 at the time of this writing), offering consumers a budget alternative that scores just a hair behind more expensive competitors.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Further reading:</strong> See our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/811315/best-monitors-2.html">best monitors</a> to learn about competing products.</p></blockquote>



<h2 id="what-are-the-innocn-15k1f-specs">What are the Innocn 15K1F specs?</h2>



<p>The Innocn 15K1F has a 1080p OLED panel with a 60Hz refresh rate. It also has a variety of connectivity options, including two USB-C and one Mini-HDMI, which makes for easy connections with most PC laptops and desktops.</p>



<ul><li>Display size: 15.6-inch widescreen</li><li>Native resolution: 1,920 x 1,080</li><li>Panel type: OLED</li><li>Refresh rate: 60Hz</li><li>Adaptive-Sync: None</li><li>HDR: HDR</li><li>Ports: 2x USB-C, 1x Mini-HDMI</li><li>Stand adjustment: Tilt</li><li>VESA mount: None</li><li>Speakers: 2x one-watt speakers</li><li>MSRP: $399.99</li></ul>



<p>OLED is the star of the show, of course, but it shares the spotlight with Innocn&rsquo;s retail pricing, which on Amazon is the lowest price of any 15.6-inch OLED portable monitor available right now.</p>



<h2 id="innocn-15k1f-design">Innocn 15K1F design&nbsp;</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Innocn 15K1F" class="wp-image-1676455" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/innocn-15k1f-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The Innocn 15K1F has an understated design made from brushed aluminum.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>The Innocn 15K1F&rsquo;s plain packaging doesn&rsquo;t make a great first impression, so I was surprised to find it housed a truly luxurious monitor. The 15K1F wedges its OLED panel between a layer of edge-to-edge glass and a brushed-aluminum chassis. It feels robust, rigid, and premium, traits that aren&rsquo;t common to most portable displays. It exceeds even the more expensive <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1500398/viewsonic-colorpro-vp16-oled-review.html">Viewsonic ColorPro VP16-OLED</a> which, though also rigid, takes a more workmanlike approach to design.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Innocn 15K1F" class="wp-image-1676456" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/innocn-15k1f-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The Innocn 15K1F&rsquo;s faux leather kickstand.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>I wish I could say the same for the stand. Innocn opts for a plastic and faux-leather kickstand case that snaps over and fully encases the display. It&rsquo;s stiff and difficult to attach out of the box. The case provides good protection against bumps and scrapes, but the material quality of both the plastic and fake leather leave a lot to be desired. Both feel inexpensive, thin, and unpleasant to the touch. This unfortunately undercuts the display&rsquo;s premium construction. The chassis is made of sturdy metal but, once encased in its kickstand case, you&rsquo;ll only see and touch a layer of cheap plastic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The magnets used to keep the kickstand portion of the stand in place are weak, as well. They manage to keep the stand in place in normal use, but moving the monitor even a few inches can cause the kickstand to fall away. There&rsquo;s only minimal room to tilt the display, which makes a comfortable viewing angle more difficult to find.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>The Innocn 15K1F is the least expensive portable monitor of its type available right now, but you wouldn&rsquo;t know that from its image quality.&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 id="innocn-15k1f-features-and-menus">Innocn 15K1F features and menus&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Two USB-C ports and a single Mini-HDMI port line the Innocn 15K1F&rsquo;s right-hand flank. Both USB-C ports support Power Delivery and DisplayPort Alternate Mode, meaning both can be used to connect to a PC. The Mini-HDMI port provides a backup for use with devices that only have HDMI. Note, however, that the monitor needs a separate USB-C power source when HDMI is in use.</p>



<p>Innocn provides all the cables you&rsquo;ll need to use the monitor. This includes USB-C to USB-C, USB-A to USB-C, HDMI to Mini-HDMI, and a USB-C power brick. Most portable monitors include these accessories, but it&rsquo;s always great to see all required accessories in the box.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Innocn 15K1F" class="wp-image-1676457" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/innocn-15k1f-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The Innocn 15K1F&rsquo;s menu is surprisingly elaborate with a decent amount of customization options.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>The 15K1F&rsquo;s menu system is more elaborate than most of Innocn&rsquo;s competitors. It can be used to adjust not only brightness and contrast but also color temperature (between 6500K and 9300K), color saturation, and color hue. Three-axis RGB color calibration is available and the display has several preset display modes including an sRGB and AdobeRGB mode. The sRGB mode correctly restrained the color gamut, though it also slightly reduced color accuracy. The monitor&rsquo;s customization options are good for the category and should please content creators looking to tune image quality to their specific needs.</p>

<p>A short tap of the power button opens the menu system, which you can then navigate with the volume buttons. It&rsquo;s a bit clumsy, but most portable monitors use a similar system. Viewsonic&rsquo;s ColorPro 16 is the only exception I&rsquo;ve recently tested. It has several menu buttons built into its kickstand.</p>



<p>Speaking of volume, the 15K1F bundles a pair of one-watt speakers. They&rsquo;re hollow, tinny and, worst of all, fail to deliver a usable level of volume. I&rsquo;ve yet to use a portable monitor with quality audio, however, so Innocn isn&rsquo;t meaningfully behind its competition here. The monitor also lacks a 3.5mm audio-out jack, so you&rsquo;ll have to rely on the audio jack your PC provides.</p>



<h2 id="innocn-15k1f-sdr-image-quality">Innocn 15K1F SDR image quality</h2>



<p>The Innocn 15K1F has a 15.6-inch OLED display with 1080p resolution. It&rsquo;s the least expensive portable monitor of its type available right now, but you wouldn&rsquo;t know that from its image quality.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Innocn 15K1F" class="wp-image-1676458" height="850" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/innocn-15k1f-brightness.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>Brightness comes in at a maximum of 290 nits. This is less than the Viewsonic ColorPro VP16-OLED&mdash;but, given the difference in price, that&rsquo;s not a big surprise. The 15K1F keeps pace with other portable monitors that have an IPS panel, such as the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1532023/arzopa-a1-gamut-portable-monitor-review.html">Azropa A1 Gamut </a>and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1520990/aoc-i1601fwux-porable-monitor-review.html">AOC I1601CF</a>, and provides a level of brightness that&rsquo;s usable in most indoor settings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just be warned: This is a glossy display, and it will show reflections. It&rsquo;s best used in a room where you&rsquo;ll have some control over the position and intensity of lighting.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Innocn 15K1F" class="wp-image-1676459" height="846" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/innocn-15k1f-contrast.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>The 15K1F reached a maximum contrast ratio of 18,600:1. This is very good, though not as high as the effectively infinite contrast ratio recorded from the Viewsonic. The difference? Viewsonic&rsquo;s monitor achieved a minimum luminance of zero nits, while Innocn&rsquo;s monitor only dipped to .02 nits.</p>



<p>Still, I feel this difference isn&rsquo;t meaningful. Both monitors have excellent contrast and are capable of displaying dark levels that subjectively seem perfect. That&rsquo;s good news if you want to watch movies or play games on a portable monitor.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Innocn 15K1F" class="wp-image-1676460" height="848" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/innocn-15k1f-color-gamut.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>Color gamut is strong, spanning 100 percent of sRGB and 99 percent of DCI-P3. Viewsonic&rsquo;s more expensive OLED once again outperforms, but the difference remains small enough that only the most discerning users are likely to care. The Innocn 15K1F provides vivid, vibrant color that really pops.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Innocn 15K1F" class="wp-image-1676461" height="902" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/innocn-15k1f-color-accuracy.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Matt Smith</p></div>



<p>Accuracy is again a hair behind the Viewsonic and ahead of less expensive portable monitors with an IPS LCD display. The 15K1F&rsquo;s color accuracy should be usable for nearly all content creators and offers a realistic, lifelike look. The monitor also provides an sRGB mode, as mentioned, which is useful if you want to create content only for the sRGB color gamut, or you&rsquo;re viewing content meant for sRGB and want a more accurate look.</p>



<p>The monitor hit a default gamma curve of 2.3, slightly off the target of 2.2. This indicates the display shows content slightly darker than it should, though I doubt most users will find it noticeable (I certainly didn&rsquo;t). Color temperature came in at 6600K, which is every-so-slightly cooler than the target of 6500K. Again, any problems introduced by this seemed imperceptible.</p>



<p>Sharpness is merely ok. The monitor&rsquo;s 15.6-inch panel with 1080p resolution packs 141 pixels per inch, which should be enough to deliver a sharp, crisp experience. However, I noticed the monitor suffers from fringing around fonts, a problem common to many OLED displays. Fonts and fine details look softer than expected. The issue is not as significant as on larger OLED monitors like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1440675/alienware-aw3423dwf-review.html">Alienware AW3423DWF</a>, but shoppers sensitive to this should be wary, and the overall look is not as crisp as it could be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Innocn 15K1F&rsquo;s image quality isn&rsquo;t perfect&mdash;but, for $269.99, it&rsquo;s hard to complain. In fact, I think it&rsquo;s fair to say this is the best image quality you can expect on a budget just shy of $200. Viewsonic&rsquo;s ColorPro VP16-OLED is superior, and Asus&rsquo; ZenScreen OLED models also perform well, but shoppers who aren&rsquo;t fussy about gamma curves or subpixel layouts will be more than happy with the 15K1F&rsquo;s vibrant, high-contrast image.</p>



<h2 id="innocn-15k1f-hdr-image-quality">Innocn 15K1F HDR image quality</h2>



<p>The Innocn 15K1F doesn&rsquo;t advertise HDR support and didn&rsquo;t accept an HDR signal when tested. This is for the best, as the monitor&rsquo;s maximum brightness of 290 nits isn&rsquo;t high enough to do HDR justice or provide a boost to luminance detail. HDR generally isn&rsquo;t viable on the current crop of portable monitors, and that&rsquo;s unlikely to change until new models arrive with high-end OLED and Mini-LED panels.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="innocn-15k1f-motion-performance">Innocn 15K1F motion performance</h2>



<p>This is a standard 60Hz monitor, but Innocn makes a point to advertise the enhanced motion clarity inherent to OLED technology. Motion clarity is better than an IPS LCD screen at 60Hz, to be sure, but not up to par with a 120Hz or 144Hz IPS LCD monitor. The 15K1F also lacks adaptive sync, so gamers will need to use in-game V-Sync settings to prevent unsightly screen tearing.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="is-the-innocn-15k1f-worth-it">Is the Innocn 15K1F worth it?</h2>



<p>Innocn&rsquo;s 15K1F is a budget OLED monitor that delivers good image quality for the price. The monitor&rsquo;s image quality falls behind more expensive OLED portable monitors but still delivers a big upgrade over more common IPS LCD portable monitors. It&rsquo;s a great middle option for shoppers who want a better visual experience from a portable monitor but aren&rsquo;t willing to spend more than $300 to snag it.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1524570/amd-ryzen-9-7950x3d-review-v-cache.html">AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D</a>&rsquo;s launch at the end of February made one thing abundantly clear: the first of Team Red&rsquo;s 7000-series <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394646/how-amds-3d-v-cache-can-increase-ryzen-performance-by-up-to-25-percent.html">3D V-Cache processors</a> were gaming monsters. Their extra additional layer of spicy L3 cache supercharged their performance.</p>



<p>But the chip everyone was waiting on&mdash;the Ryzen 7 7800X3D&mdash;was still a question mark. Held until its April 6 launch, the $450 CPU is the &ldquo;affordable&rdquo; option compared to the $699 7950X3D and $599 Ryzen 9 7900X3D, and one that many gamers were eyeing with ready anticipation. We knew the 7800X3D&rsquo;s technical details (which you can dig into via <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdO-5F86_xo&amp;xcust=2-1-1686772-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">our YouTube coverage</a>), but how it&rsquo;d slot on to the leaderboards was a mystery.</p>

<p>Now with this chip on shelves, we finally know: Like its siblings, this processor is a beast, too. In fact it&rsquo;s the best CPU you can buy for gaming, if that&rsquo;s all you do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s more to this latest addition to the Ryzen 7000 lineup, as the benchmarks from all around the web show&mdash;and the info can heavily influence if the 7800X3D is right for you. Here&rsquo;s what you need to know.</p>



<h2 id="in-games-it-sits-with-intel-and-amds-best-chips">In games, it sits with Intel and AMD&rsquo;s best chips</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3d" class="wp-image-1446919" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/AMD-Ryzen-9-7950X3d.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The Ryzen 7 7800X3D can match the 7950X3D&rsquo;s top-tier performance in games&mdash;while costing $250 less.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Patrick Murray / IDG</p></div>



<p>On site after site, the benchmarks show a similar outcome&mdash;the Ryzen 7 7800X3D punching way above its weight class in games. Whether it&rsquo;s <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/amd-ryzen-7-7800x3d-cpu-review/4&amp;xcust=2-1-1686772-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Tom&rsquo;s Hardware</a> or <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.techspot.com/review/2657-amd-ryzen-7800x3d/&amp;xcust=2-1-1686772-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">TechSpot</a>, this processor&rsquo;s average performance in games puts it on the same footing as its much more expensive sibling, the 7950X3D. And that&rsquo;s a CPU which edges past Intel&rsquo;s top chips, like the Core i9-13900K.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, when looking at the aggregate scores, the 7800X3D sometimes displaces the 7950X3D from top spot. And for the reviews where it doesn&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;ll usually find it in second place. Meanwhile, Intel&rsquo;s $418 Core i7-13700K&mdash;its closest rival in price&mdash;trails behind. Depending on the benchmarking suite (as reviewers don&rsquo;t have complete overlap in the games they test with), the 7800X3D can offer about 6 to 13 percent higher performance on average.</p>

<p>That said, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D doesn&rsquo;t always top the charts in every single individual game. In titles with better optimization for Intel processors, or ones more affected by clock speed than cache size, the 7800X3D falls to the middle or even toward the bottom of the pack of high-powered processors. If you fire up the same game every night (e.g., <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em>) and expect top frame rates from your system, you should examine the relevant test results to make sure this processor is a good match.</p>

<p>Throw games at the Ryzen 7 7800X3D, and it&rsquo;ll handle most of them with aplomb. Even when falling notably behind the top performers, it posts big frame rates.

<p>However, with non-gaming tasks, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D&rsquo;s results can&rsquo;t be contextualized in the same way. Either a chip is faster in encoding and rendering, or it&rsquo;s not. And for anything heavily reliant on CPU speed or core count, the 7800X3D lags behind. You can see it for yourself in Cinebench R23 multicore results&mdash;compared to the 13700K, AMD&rsquo;s latest is 37% slower in <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.techspot.com/review/2657-amd-ryzen-7800x3d/#:~:text=When%20running%20the%20all%2Dcore%20workload%20in%20Cinebench%20R23&amp;xcust=2-1-1686772-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">TechSpot&rsquo;s review</a>. Other outlets had similar findings.</p>



<p>This behavior tracks with what we saw in the first-generation 3D V-Cache CPU, the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/701130/tested-the-ryzen-7-5800x3ds-astonishing-performance-shows-how-far-amds-ryzen-has-come.html">similarly fantastic Ryzen 7 5800X3D</a> (the 7800X3D&rsquo;s predecessor!), as well as the 7950X3D when it launched. Neither of those chips could pull even with their X-variant siblings (5800X, 7950X) in content creation tasks.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3d die" class="wp-image-1446922" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/AMD-Ryzen-9-7950X3d-die.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The 7950X3D and 7900X3D  use two chiplets in their die, whereas the 7800X3D just has a single chiplet. In the dual-chiplet chips, one is geared toward faster clock speeds, and the other layered with the extra L3 cache, a design that helps promote better performance across different workloads.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Patrick Murray / IDG</p></div>



<p>But AMD&rsquo;s two higher-end Ryzen 7000 3D V-Cache processors can still rip through heavy production workloads&mdash;they&rsquo;re not incapable, just a little slower than the top CPUs in that regard. They&rsquo;re well-suited for gamers who also want strong performance in all-core workloads, just not as much as someone whose main priority is work first, play second.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D is first and foremost a gaming CPU. If you need a processor with more even, balanced performance across the board, a rival like Intel&rsquo;s Core i7-13700K will be a more ideal choice. But if you&rsquo;re all in on gaming performance and can wait longer for encode to finish, this is your chip.</p>



<h2 id="its-the-most-power-efficient-gaming-chip">It&rsquo;s the most power-efficient gaming chip</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="How to measure power consumption with a meter - watts" class="wp-image-1067648" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/How-to-measure-appliance-power-use.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The 7800X3D goes easier on power consumption while still posting impressive benchmark results.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jim Martin / Foundry</p></div>



<p>In chart after chart measuring power consumption, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D drinks down electricity far more modestly than similarly priced processors&mdash;and definitely less than AMD and Intel&rsquo;s standard flagship CPUs.</p>



<p>The exception, of course, are the other 3D V-Cache CPUs. These parts consume less energy due to lower voltages, in turn lowers the amount of heat produced&mdash;a necessary design choice to mitigate the thermal consequences of having more L3 cache stacked on.</p>

<p>So on occasion, you can see a benchmark result where the 7950X3D noses past the humbler Ryzen 7 7800X3D. But overall, the 7800X3D hits a utility bill far more softly than the 7950X and 13900K, which take no prisoners and make no apologies for gobbling down watts. Its weaker production performance can be traced directly to how much energy it uses. Just have a peek at <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.techspot.com/review/2657-amd-ryzen-7800x3d/#:~:text=case%20for%20Blender.-,System%20Power%20Consumption,-The%207800X3D%20is&amp;xcust=2-1-1686772-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">TechSpot&rsquo;s examination of electricity used</a> while running a Blender rendering test. The 13700K is 44 percent faster, but it also consumes <em>89</em> percent more power.</p>



<p>In games, the gap isn&rsquo;t quite so wide, but still notable&mdash;you&rsquo;ll see differences between 20 and 28 percent in power consumption compared to chips like the 13700K and 13900K, often while the Ryzen 7 7800X3D is outperforming them.

<p>The Ryzen 7 7800X3D is a ferocious chip, but you won&rsquo;t benefit if it&rsquo;s the most powerful component in your build. Unlike with a processor that can also tear through production work, its main purpose is to keep your gaming rig firing on all cylinders.</p>



<p>And in a gaming rig, you&rsquo;ll be best served by skewing your budget more toward your GPU, rather than your CPU. You don&rsquo;t want your processor to bottleneck your graphics card, of course, but if your CPU is more powerful than the GPU, you&rsquo;re not making the most of your build.</p>

<p>Given how far the Ryzen 7 7800X3D can stretch its legs, it can comfortably partner the best video cards on the market, e.g., the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 or AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT. It&rsquo;s the best gaming CPU for high-end yet still price-conscious shoppers&mdash;when you want the absolute best for the wide variety of games you play, without overspending on performance for heavily threaded or clock-speed-sensitive workloads you&rsquo;ll never run.</p>



<p>So if you&rsquo;re deciding between an <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394228/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-review.html">RTX 3060</a> and an <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393649/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-founders-edition-review-vs-2080-ti.html">RTX 3070</a> (or <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393729/amd-radeon-rx-6800-rx-6800-xt-review.html">Radeon RX 6800 XT</a>), the better graphics card and a cheaper (say, $300) CPU will give you better bang for your gaming buck. That doesn&rsquo;t make the 7800X3D a bad choice&mdash;rather, it&rsquo;s best suited for high-end gaming rigs where the CPU could be a potential choke point.</p>

<p>Would-be buyers of Ryzen 7000 CPUs got welcome news this week&mdash;the launch of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1681282/affordable-a620-motherboards-for-ryzen-7000-cpus-finally-exist.html">a budget A620 chipset</a> for AM5 motherboards. But even if you were to scrape that low to save a few bucks (perhaps to afford the 7800X3D, however ill-advised), the reality is that you still can&rsquo;t beat the savings you can get with an Intel chip. Not if you&rsquo;re willing to drop down to slower (and cheaper) memory.</p>



<p>AM5 motherboards&mdash;the sole <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1520957/best-gaming-motherboards-picks-for-intel-and-amd.html">motherboards compatible with Ryzen 7000</a>&mdash;support DDR5 memory only. Prices have come down for this faster RAM, but they haven&rsquo;t bottomed out to match DDR4 memory pricing yet. Meanwhile, DDR4 motherboards exist for Intel chips, and they&rsquo;re cheaper than DDR5 motherboards. So you&rsquo;ll save on both the mobo and the memory with Intel.</p>

## Samsung’s killer software makes Galaxy PCs, phones, and tablets better together

<p>Have you ever purchased a PC not because of the hardware, but because of the software? No, not Windows &mdash; the apps. Samsung is absolutely determined that you will &mdash; and invest in other Samsung Galaxy devices, too, because of how well they interact with one another.</p>



<p>You could buy an HP laptop, a Google Pixel phone, and an Amazon Fire tablet. Or, you could buy a Samsung Galaxy Book3, a Galaxy Tab tablet, and a Galaxy S23 phone. Why would you? Because Samsung offers apps and services to tie all three together far more tightly than buying a bunch of random devices. We call this an <em>ecosystem</em>, and Samsung wants to convince you that its Galaxy ecosystem is the equal of higher-profile rivals like Windows, iOS, and Android.</p>

<p>In the PC world, this is rare. You probably know that you still need an Apple iPhone to talk to an Apple Watch, but when was the last time a PC maker sold you on an app that could do something similar? (We&rsquo;d have to go way back to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407780/dell-mobile-connect-app-mirrors-your-smartphone-on-your-pc.html">Dell&rsquo;s Mobile Connect</a> app for that.) So we set out to investigate whether Samsung&rsquo;s own ecosystem made sense, by connecting several of its devices together and determining whether the whole, to use a cliche, was greater than the sum of its parts.</p>



<p>It is. In fact, it is, to an almost ludicrous extreme. If there&rsquo;s a word for what Samsung wants you to be able to do across all of its devices, it&rsquo;s <em>share</em>: share screens, share notifications, files, and more. But, as you&rsquo;ll see, the ways in which it sometimes goes so far beyond what you&rsquo;ll need, with so many different apps, that it&rsquo;s either incredibly thorough or deeply confusing. There&rsquo;s no one app to do it absolutely all &mdash; and maybe that should be Samsung&rsquo;s ultimate goal.</p>



<h2 id="creating-your-galaxy-of-devices">Creating your &ldquo;Galaxy&rdquo; of devices</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro 360" class="wp-image-1502987" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/PHO23_167_GalaxyBook3Series_v2.00_06_54_03.Still001-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The Samsung Book Book3 Pro 360 earned our Editors&rsquo; Choice award.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Willis Lai</p></div>



<p>For this test, I used a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1499055/samsung-galaxy-book3-pro-360-review.html">Samsung Galaxy Book Book3 Pro 360</a>, supplied by Samsung, alongside a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.techadvisor.com/article/1511727/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1536118-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Galaxy S23 Ultra</a> smartphone and a Galaxy Tab tablet. Just for fun, I turned my &ldquo;normal&rdquo; three-screen setup (the Book3 Pro 360, a 1440p widescreen display, and a 4K display in portrait mode) into a six-screen monster with the laptop, two displays, a Galaxy S22 phone, a Galaxy S23 Ultra, and a Galaxy Tab tablet. </p>



<p>There&rsquo;s one other requirement: a Samsung account. In many cases, your devices will need to be connected to the same Wi-Fi network, but you&rsquo;ll also need to sign up for a Samsung account if you haven&rsquo;t already. This isn&rsquo;t that different than authenticating yourself on any other device, but Samsung uses the account name to verify you&rsquo;re you.</p>



<p>Once authenticated, it&rsquo;s time to start exploring which apps do what.</p>

<p><strong>Connect your Galaxy Book to your tablet</strong>: The simplest way to connect your Galaxy Book laptop to the Galaxy Tab tablet is through an application called <strong>Second Screen</strong>, an app that typically ships preinstalled on Galaxy devices. Second Screen does what it says. It turns your tablet into a secondary screen, which it treats as a secondary PC display. You can arrange that display in your Windows Settings as you would an ordinary display, with your only decision being to optimize it for a slower, smoother connection or a version optimized for video. While you have the option of turning off the Tab&rsquo;s input (keyboard, touch, etc.), leaving it on is useful and recommended.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Sansung Second Screen" class="wp-image-1669943" height="744" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Second-screen.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Samsung&rsquo;s Second Screen app spans  your notebook screen across the Galalxy Tab, turning it into a second display.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>While video transmission doesn&rsquo;t seem to be perfect (there were some dropped frames, even optimized) this is an excellent way to relax with a tablet on a plane or train and then use the Tab as an additional laptop monitor later that night. The only drawback is that it turns the Tab into a &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; display, hiding its Android filesystem and interface. </p>



<p><strong>Control your tablet and phone via your Galaxy Book</strong>: Samsung also offers a Windows app called <strong>Samsung Multi Control</strong>, which allows you to treat your tablet and phone(s) as screens that you can control with your PC. (You&rsquo;ll find it within the <em>Samsung Settings app &gt; Connected devices</em>.) This is a bit different than Second Screen, since you can actually &ldquo;mouse over&rdquo; to your phone &mdash; yes, your mouse cursor appears on your phone screen, and you can interact with it, too. You can also copy and paste data from your phone/tablet to your PC, and/or use your PC keyboard to type into your phone or tablet. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Samsung Galaxy Multi Flow" class="wp-image-1669980" height="834" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Galaxy-Flow-edit.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>See the mouse arrow? It may seem like a stupid smartphone trick, but Samsung Multi Control is pretty useful in the right situations.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Here, the advantage is that Multi Control replaces the good old fashioned sneakernet as a handy solution to the &ldquo;I just took a photo with my phone, now what?&rdquo; question. There are plenty of potential answers: emailing the photo or document to yourself, uploading it to the cloud, and more. But being able to mouse directly your phone&rsquo;s Gallery app, copy a photo, and then drag it into a PowerPoint presentation or design document offers an immediacy that other methods don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve used this myself after shooting a quick photo for a review or feature article.</p>



<p><strong>Mirror your phone or tablet with your Galaxy Book:</strong> This is where Samsung&rsquo;s app ecosystem gets a little weird. <strong>Samsung Flow</strong> is an older Android app that shipped with the Book3 Pro 360, but required a manual download on the Galaxy S23 Ultra. Flow provides more of a two-way connection. Instead of mousing on the phone or tablet, Flow creates a mirror of your mobile device in a PC window that you can move around your desktop as well as interact with &mdash; clicking down into the phone&rsquo;s app drawer, for example. (The Galaxy phone simply recognizes the virtual input as real input.) Moreover, you can also send files to your phone with a secondary interface. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Samsung Flow on a Galaxy S23 Ultra" class="wp-image-1669979" height="762" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Samsung-Flow.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Samsung Flow allows you to mirror your phone on your desktop as well as send messages and files to your phone.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>It&rsquo;s a little clunky, especially when your mouse cursor can seemingly get stuck within the virtual phone interface, surviving right clicks, taps of the <em>ESC</em> key, and so on. But Flow is one of the only direct ways Samsung offers to drop files on your phone.</p>



<p><strong>Send files from your Book to your phone and back: </strong>Flow offers one way to do this. If moving a file from your PC to your Galaxy phone or tablet is the only thing you want to do, however, Samsung&rsquo;s <strong>Quick Share</strong> offers another. Simply pick a device, open up File Explorer, and select which files you want to transfer to a friend or contact. The only catch is that, with Quick Share, the two devices must be connected and their screen must be on. (Google has <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1680736/androids-airdrop-alternative-nearby-share-now-works-on-windows.html">finally released a similar Windows app, called Nearby Share</a>, which traverses the entire Android ecosystem.) <strong>Secure Share</strong> works similarly, only you can add an expiration date to the file &mdash; like many cloud storage services already do.</p>



<p>But wait, there&rsquo;s more!</p>



<p><strong><em>Manage</em> your phone or tablet with your Galaxy Book</strong>: At this point, the amount of sharing and control options Samsung offers borders is already a little silly. (We&rsquo;re also running out of words to describe the differences in what the various apps can do!) </p>



<p>This last option isn&rsquo;t only Samsung&rsquo;s idea. <strong><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/628261/microsoft-is-updating-your-phone-and-calling-it-phone-link.html">Phone Link</a></strong> (which is called Link to Windows on your phone) has been a staple of Windows for several years, and offers an organized, clean interface for managing your phone&rsquo;s notifications, sending and receiving texts, and even placing calls on the phone, from your PC. You can even view your phone&rsquo;s home screen and access individual phone apps, even pinning those apps to your PC. <em>That&rsquo;s</em> pretty cool.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Phone Link Galaxy S23 Ultra" class="wp-image-1669975" height="925" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Phone-Link.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Phone Link for Windows offers a direct connection to your phone, and you&rsquo;ll see even more benefits with Samsung Galaxy devices.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>As we&rsquo;ve noted before, Samsung (as well as the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/545199/microsoft-surface-duo-2-review.html">Microsoft Surface Duo 2 smartphone</a>) enjoys a special relationship with Microsoft, offering these basic functions plus a couple more: direct access to the phone&rsquo;s hotspot features, and being able to browse the websites your phone was looking at, too. </p>



<p>It all requires a <em>ton</em> of permissions and notifications to be sent back and forth, but when set up, Phone Link can be an extremely useful tool.</p>

<p>Samsung includes Clip Studio Paint, for example, which can connect to a Galaxy S23 Ultra, with stylus, to serve as a second screen for selecting colors and the like. Samsung&rsquo;s Expert RAW Auto Share works similarly to the apps above &mdash; if you shoot photos with a Galaxy phone that supports the RAW image format, like the S23 Ultra, you&rsquo;ll have the handy option for the phone to send photos automatically to your PC for editing in Adobe Lightroom. (Conveniently, Samsung supplies a two-month trial of that very app.) </p>



<p>Samsung also includes a number of more traditional pieces of bloatware; apps that either reproduce existing Windows functions, or relatively useless content. (TV Studio Plus is a collection of streaming video with built-in 90-second commercial breaks that no one sold commercials for.) </p>



<p>Samsung does have room for further improvement. If there&rsquo;s an app to turn your Galaxy phone into a PC webcam, for example, I&rsquo;m not aware of it. (Why buy one of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393756/1080p-webcam-buying-guide.html">PCWorld&rsquo;s recommended webcams</a> if you have a phone, anyway?) A Samsung clock app could potentially tie into the Galaxy Watch, recommending brief meditation breaks and using the Watch&rsquo;s stress meter to measure if it worked.</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s going to be the key for Samsung going forward. Samsung has nailed cross-device sharing, but it lacks cohesion. Push that forward, expand upon it, and hopefully bring all this functionality inside of much fewer apps, and you&rsquo;ll have that many more reasons to buy everything from Samsung.</p>

<p>Lenovo&rsquo;s Yoga 9i, the company&rsquo;s consumer laptop flagship, is mostly unchanged for 2023 but receives a few notable upgrades including Intel Core 13th-gen processors and a standard OLED display (which was an option before). These improvements keep pace with the competition, though they also lead to a higher price tag.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Looking for more 2-in-1 options? Check out our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/917881/best-2-in-1-laptops.html">best 2-in-1 laptops</a> available today.</p></blockquote>



<h2 id="lenovo-yoga-9i-specs-and-features">Lenovo Yoga 9i: Specs and features</h2>



<p>The Lenovo Yoga 9i is powered by Intel&rsquo;s new Core i7-1360P processor accompanied by 16GB of LPDDR5 memory and Intel Iris Xe graphics. This is one of the first Intel Core i7-1360P laptops to arrive for review, so I&rsquo;m eager to see how it performs.</p>



<ul><li>CPU: Intel Core i7-1360P</li><li>Memory: 16GB LPDDR5</li><li>Graphics/GPU: Intel Iris Xe (96 EUs)</li><li>Display: 2880&times;1880 OLED 16:10 90Hz</li><li>Storage: 512GB PCIe Gen4 SSD</li><li>Webcam: 1080 with IR&nbsp;</li><li>Connectivity: 2x Thunderbolt 4 / USB-C 3.2 with DisplayPort Alternate Mode and Power Delivery, 1x USB-C 3.2 with DisplayPort Alternate Mode and Power Delivery, 1x 3.5mm audio&nbsp;</li><li>Networking: WiFi 6E, Bluetooth 5.1</li><li>Biometrics: Windows Hello Facial Recognition, Fingerprint Reader</li><li>Battery capacity: 75 watt-hours</li><li>Dimensions: 12.52 inches x 9.06 inches x 0.6 inches</li><li>Weight: 3.09 pounds</li><li>MSRP: $1,700</li></ul>



<p>Lenovo also improves the base display to a 2880&times;1880 OLED, which was an optional upgrade on the prior model. A 3840&times;2400 OLED is available as an upgrade. That&rsquo;s nice to see, but making the OLED display standard increases the base MSRP: the previous model was available starting at just $1,230.</p>



<h2 id="lenovo-yoga-9i-design-and-build-quality">Lenovo Yoga 9i: Design and build quality</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Yoga 9i design" class="wp-image-1677712" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pcworld-lenovo-yoga-9i-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>I had high praise for <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/631211/lenovo-yoga-9i-review-the-pinnacle-of-design.html">2022&rsquo;s Lenovo Yoga 9i</a>, which I called &ldquo;the pinnacle of design,&rdquo; and this extends to the nearly identical 2023 model. Lenovo&rsquo;s specifications suggest the new Yoga 9i is slightly thinner and smaller than its predecessor, as well as a tad heavier, but I couldn&rsquo;t notice a difference.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What I did notice is the 2-in-1&rsquo;s sleek, svelte, and classy exterior. The Yoga 9i pairs an attractive silver exterior with a chrome finish that lines the sides of the device. This provides a touch of class and luxury, yet doesn&rsquo;t look gaudy. Lenovo&rsquo;s design choices are practical, too, with curved surfaces and edges that prove pleasant to handle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Yoga 9i is a 2-in-1 with 360-degree hinge, which means the laptop&rsquo;s display can fold back until it converts into a tablet. Lenovo opts for a sturdy, smooth hinge that extends nearly the entire width of the display. It&rsquo;s easy to maneuver into tablet mode and can also support the laptop in &ldquo;tent&rdquo; mode, which uses the keyboard as a kickstand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The device is too heavy to use as a true iPad alternative (it&rsquo;s roughly three times heavier than the base iPad), but it&rsquo;s an acceptable substitute in short bursts. It helps that Lenovo bundles an active stylus, giving every owner access to Windows&rsquo; surprisingly good handwriting recognition.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="lenovo-yoga-9i-keyboard-trackpad-pen">Lenovo Yoga 9i: Keyboard, trackpad, pen</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Yoga 9i keyboard" class="wp-image-1677713" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pcworld-lenovo-yoga-9i-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>The Yoga 9i has an excellent set of keys with good key travel, taut key action, and subtle but noticeable tactile feedback as keys reach their activation point. The layout is spacious, too, as the keys span nearly the entire width of the keyboard. Lenovo puts the extra space to work with an additional row of function keys, which includes a fingerprint reader, on the keyboard&rsquo;s right flank.</p>



<p>The touchpad is superb. It measures about five inches wide and three inches deep. That&rsquo;s huge for a 14-inch Windows laptop and equal to Apple&rsquo;s MacBook Pro 14. The touchpad&rsquo;s surface is smooth, responsive, and provides plenty of room for using Windows&rsquo; excellent multi-touch gestures. It&rsquo;s definitely among the best touchpads currently available on a 14-inch laptop.</p>



<p>Lenovo bundles the Yoga 9i with an active stylus that supports 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity, tilt detection, and the WGP, AES 2.0, and MPP 2.0 protocols. It also has a built-in rechargeable battery. The pen felt great when writing notes and seemed acceptable for digital art and illustration (though my artistic skills are lacking). The Yoga 9i doesn&rsquo;t include a place to store the pen, however, so it may prove easy to lose. A replacement will set you back $59.99.</p>



<h2 id="lenovo-yoga-9i-display-audio">Lenovo Yoga 9i: Display, audio</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Yoga 9i flipped" class="wp-image-1679544" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pcworld-lenovo-yoga-9i-5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>The 2023 Yoga 9i upgrades the base display option from a 1920 x 1200 IPS LCD touchscreen to a 2800 x 1800 OLED display. This is the display that arrived in my review unit. Lenovo also offers a 3840&times;2400 OLED for just $100.</p>



<p>Image quality is excellent. The OLED screen provides amazing contrast, superb luminance uniformity, and vivid color across a wide range of content. Everyone will enjoy its performance when streaming shows, playing games, or watching movies. Content creators will appreciate the display&rsquo;s wide color gamut, which spans 99 percent of DCI-P3, and precise color accuracy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sharpness is great, too, with a pixel density of 323 pixels per inch. Fine text looks crisp and refined with no sign of pixelation. The optional 3840&times;2400 OLED&rsquo;s meager price tag makes it a tempting upgrade for content creators who want to view and edit 4K content at native resolution.</p>



<p>The display has a 16:10 aspect ratio, which is a bit taller than a 16:9 widescreen. This provides more vertical display space and makes multitasking easier. Snapping documents to each edge of the display provides a usable view of each. Nearly all laptops and 2-in-1s in the Yoga 9i&rsquo;s price bracket have moved to a 16:10 aspect ratio, so this isn&rsquo;t an advantage over the competition&mdash;but it remains a perk.</p>



<p>HDR is supported and works reasonably well, but the Yoga 9i&rsquo;s OLED screen maxes out around 410 nits fullscreen. That&rsquo;s not enough to reveal the full range of luminance detail that HDR can provide. It&rsquo;s a decent experience, though, and I&rsquo;d generally recommend using HDR when it&rsquo;s available from streaming shows, movies, and games (though not on the Windows desktop). The Yoga 9&rsquo;s brightness can also be an issue when traveling. 410 nits isn&rsquo;t bad, but the OLED display is highly reflective and a bright light source can overpower its luminance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interestingly, the 2880&times;1800 OLED display has a 90Hz refresh rate, which is quicker than most OLED laptops (the optional 3840&times;2400 OLED is only 60Hz). This offers a smoother experience even on the Windows desktop, where scrolling through web pages and moving windows feels a tad more responsive. It&rsquo;s a minor difference, but I found it noticeable.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Yoga i9 speakers" class="wp-image-1679537" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pcworld-lenovo-yoga-9i-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>Lenovo delivers a top-notch audio experience with a miniature soundbar built into the hinge. It packs a pair of two-watt tweets and a pair of three-watt woofers. The result is loud, voluminous sound with body and heft normally unavailable from a laptop. It&rsquo;s so loud, in fact, that using it at maximum volume can become a bit odd&mdash;you&rsquo;ll feel the bass pumping through your palms! It&rsquo;s easily the best audio I&rsquo;ve ever heard from a 13-inch to 15-inch class laptop.</p>



<h2 id="lenovo-yoga-9i-webcam-microphone-biometrics">Lenovo Yoga 9i: Webcam, microphone, biometrics</h2>



<p>The Yoga 9i has a solid 1080p webcam. Video quality is good with crisp presentation and attractive color. Exposure remains an issue, as any mixed lighting will confuse the camera, and the image can still appear grainy in low light. Lenovo offers a built-in background blurring utility that can be turned on with a keyboard shortcut. It&rsquo;s a handy way to quickly blur your background in video calls.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lenovo also delivers on microphone quality with a great dual-microphone array. It provides plenty of volume and crisp dialogue. Repetitive background noises are nicely subdued, as well, allowing only the loudest and most irregular noise through. The microphone quality is great for a laptop and better than most standalone webcams below $100.</p>



<p>Biometric login is available through both Windows Hello and a fingerprint reader on the right side of the keyboard. Windows Hello is quicker and reliable in most situations, but both biometric login methods work well.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="lenovo-yoga-9i-connectivity">Lenovo Yoga 9i: Connectivity</h2>



<p>The Lenovo Yoga 9i goes all-in on forward-thinking connectivity. It has three USB-C ports, all of which support Power Delivery and DisplayPort Alternate Mode. The two USB-C ports on the left side also support <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1356812/next-generation-thunderbolt-will-hit-80gbps-too.html">Thunderbolt 4</a>. These are joined by a single USB-A port and a 3.5mm combo audio jack.</p>



<p>Leaning heavily on USB-C has its problems. Those hoping to connect to older USB-A devices, or to an HDMI device (like a TV or projector) will need to buy an adapter or, more likely, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/402858/the-best-usb-c-hubs-for-your-laptop-tablet-or-2-in-1.html">a USB-C hub or dock</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the plus side, all three USB-C ports can power the laptop, and all three can handle DisplayPort Alternate Mode. This is the best way to approach USB-C. Users shouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about whether they&rsquo;re using the correct USB-C port.</p>



<p>Lenovo provides great wireless connectivity with support for Bluetooth 5.1 and Wi-Fi 6E, the latest Wi-Fi standard. Most homes don&rsquo;t yet have <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/823810/wi-fi-5-vs-wi-fi-6-vs-wi-fi-6e-which-router-should-you-pick.html">a Wi-Fi 6E router</a>, but those that do should experience excellent Wi-Fi performance. Wi-Fi 6 performance is also healthy, with good connectivity and the ability to reach gigabit speeds when used in close proximity to a router.</p>



<h2 id="lenovo-yoga-9i-performance">Lenovo Yoga 9i: Performance</h2>



<p>All current Lenovo Yoga 9i variants come with Intel&rsquo;s Core i7-1360P processor, a 12-core CPU with four performance cores and eight efficient cores. My review unit paired that with 16GB of RAM, a 512GB PCIe Gen4 solid state drive, and Intel Iris Xe graphics. This is a typical setup for a high-end Windows 2-in-1 and it delivered strong yet unsurprising results.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Yoga 9i PCMark 10" class="wp-image-1679538" height="769" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lenovo-yoga-9i-2023-pcmark-10.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>PCMark 10, a full-system benchmark that leans heavily on CPU performance, reported a very strong score of 6194. That&rsquo;s the best score of all the laptops included for comparison, though the HP Dragonfly Pro comes rather close. This result shows the Core i7-1360P is a good choice for general use, and that the Yoga 9&rsquo;s RAM and SSD choices don&rsquo;t let the laptop down.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Yoga 9i Cinebench" class="wp-image-1679539" height="750" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lenovo-yoga-9i-2023-cinebench-r15.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>Next up is Cinebench R15, a heavily multithreaded benchmark that scales well as more cores are added. The Yoga 9i does well but doesn&rsquo;t excel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1661500/hp-dragonfly-pro-review.html">HP Dragonfly Pro</a>, powered by AMD&rsquo;s Ryzen 7 7736U, scores a confident win over both the Yoga 9i and Samsung Galaxy Book3, both of which are Intel Core i7-1360P laptops. The Ryzen 7 7736U has fewer cores but doesn&rsquo;t use less capable &ldquo;efficient&rdquo; cores.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1386626/asus-zenbook-pro-14-duo-oled-review-perfecting-the-dual-display-laptop.html">Asus&rsquo; Zenbook Pro 14 Duo OLED</a>, powered by an Intel Core i7-12700H, accelerates past the pack. This is to be expected, as the Core i7-12700H has two additional &ldquo;performance&rdquo; cores (six performance and eight efficient cores). It also draws more power.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Yoga 9i Handbrake" class="wp-image-1679540" height="762" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lenovo-yoga-9i-2023-handbrake.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>The Handbrake video encoding test tells a similar story. The HP Dragonfly Pro and Asus Zenbook Pro 14 Duo OLED retain an advantage over Yoga 9i, but by a much smaller margin. The Yoga 9i&rsquo;s result remains strong, though, as evidenced by the far slower Microsoft Surface Laptop 5.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Yoga 9i Time Spy" class="wp-image-1679541" height="759" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lenovo-yoga-9i-2023-3dmark.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>3D graphics performance is a weakness. The Yoga 9i scored just 1,917 in 3DMark Time Spy. That&rsquo;s about equal to the Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro 360, which also has an Intel Core i7-1360P processor with Intel Iris Xe graphics. The HP Dragonfly Pro squeezes out a victory, however, thanks to its Radeon 680M integrated graphics. Asus&rsquo; Zenbook Pro 14 Duo OLED with Nvidia RTX 3050 Ti discrete graphics is in another league entirely.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I also tried the Lenovo Yoga 9i in <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> at 1080p resolution and Highest detail settings. The game ran at an unplayable 19 frames per second. To be fair, Highest is a demanding setting, and the game becomes playable at Medium detail. The Yoga 9i also scored 4,655 in the <em>Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker</em> benchmark. That indicates playable performance (roughly 30 FPS, though this game varies significantly depending on the scene), but only at 1080p and medium to low settings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Lenovo Yoga 9i&rsquo;s overall performance is typical for a premium Windows 2-in-1 with a 14-inch display. Better performance can be found from laptops of this size, like the Asus Zenbook Pro 14 Duo OLED, but laptops that thump the Yoga 9i are generally larger, heavier, and don&rsquo;t last as long on a charge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The HP Dragonfly Pro should give Intel reason to worry, though. This AMD-powered alternative beat the Yoga 9i in multiple benchmarks, yet it&rsquo;s similar to the Yoga 9i in size and weight. AMD&rsquo;s Ryzen 7000 series could prove a serious threat to Intel&rsquo;s 13th-gen Core.</p>



<h2 id="lenovo-yoga-9i-battery-life">Lenovo Yoga 9i: Battery life</h2>



<p>The Lenovo Yoga 9i has a 75 watt-hour battery which powered the laptop for 10 hours and 39 minutes in our standard battery test, which loops a 4K file of the short film <em>Tears of Steel</em>. This is a respectable result for a 2-in-1 laptop. It can handle a full day of light to moderate use (like writing in Microsoft Word or browsing the web).</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Yoga 9i battery life" class="wp-image-1679542" height="791" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lenovo-yoga-9i-2023-battery-life.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>The Yoga 9i&rsquo;s battery life is in line with the alternatives. It&rsquo;s outperformed by the Samsung Galaxy Book 3 Pro 360, which has a larger screen, but squeezes out a win against the Microsoft Surface Laptop 5. The Yoga 9i also defeats the Asus Zenbook Pro 14 Duo OLED.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="lenovo-yoga-9i-should-you-buy-it">Lenovo Yoga 9i: Should you buy it?</h2>



<p>The Lenovo Yoga 9i maintains its position as a top-tier 2-in-1 laptop. It boasts sleek design, excellent OLED display, and top-notch audio. The Yoga 9i also provides solid performance respectable battery life for its class.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Available starting at $1,700, the Yoga 9i is somewhat expensive but delivers good value for money. Lenovo even bundles a laptop sleeve and active stylus. Anyone looking for a Windows 2-in-1 in 2023 should place the latest Yoga 9i at the top of their list.&nbsp;</p>
