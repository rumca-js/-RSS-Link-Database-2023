There\u2019s an earnestness with which Crime Boss has been put together that I do admire \u2013 as a kind of direct-to-VHS knockoff of Payday on a promising \u201990s backdrop \u2013 and there is an inescapable novelty in seeing these de-aged Hollywood stars steering the story here. Unfortunately, the hokey charm on display is nowhere near enough to offset the repetitive and regularly frustrating mission design, its roguelike single-player rapidly becomes a total chore, and its co-op juice just isn\u2019t worth the squeeze. Sadly, Crime Boss: Rockay City\u2019s coked-up ego has been writing cheques its budget-priced body couldn\u2019t cash.\"\n\nNote: Due to an unforeseen anomaly with our video capture, this review is only available in 720p.
