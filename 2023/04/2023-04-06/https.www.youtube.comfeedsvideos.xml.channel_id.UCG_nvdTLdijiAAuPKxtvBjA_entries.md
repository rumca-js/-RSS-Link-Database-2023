Avatar: The Way of Water finally came out to blow up the box office. It didn't make 200 Morbillion dollars like Morbius, sadly, but it did manage to pull people in. And that's quite curious since it's three hours long and not a property that people care about like with Avengers Endgame. It's secret weapon in keeping people hooked and entertained, though, is playing out like a video game. We often talk about the video game movie curse as a bad thing, but today let's see how you can mine great things from building your movie like a video game.

Avatar: The Way of Water (2022)
Avatar: The Way of Water reaches new heights and explores undiscovered depths as James Cameron returns to the world of Pandora in this emotionally packed action adventure. Set more than a decade after the events of the first film, Avatar: The Way of Water launches the story of the Sully family (Jake, Neytiri, and their kids), the trouble that follows them, the lengths they go to keep each other safe, the battles they fight to stay alive, and the tragedies they endure. All of this against the breathtaking backdrop of Pandora, where audiences are introduced to new Na'vi cultures and a range of exotic sea creatures that populate the majestic oceans. Nominated for numerous Academy Awards¬Æ including Best Picture, the James Cameron-directed film became the third highest-grossing box office film of all-time and set a new benchmark for visual effects.
