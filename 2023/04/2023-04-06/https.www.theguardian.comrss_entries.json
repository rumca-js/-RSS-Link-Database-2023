Set in the family\u2019s home town of Margate, it was a summer hellscape: gross, grotty, foul-mouthed, simmering with familial resentment. It was also laugh-out-loud funny. That Horgan won a Bafta for her trouble came as no surprise.</p><p>It\u2019s also no surprise that Sky have decided to expand these 10 minutes of taut, bristling comedy into a six-part dramedy. In doing so, however, there have been significant personnel changes. Horgan is off writing duties (she is still executive producer), replaced by a team that includes the comedian Sarah Kendall, the author Emma Jane Unsworth and Gabby Best, who plays Clare, one of two other sisters who appear in both versions. Trish \u2013 originally the extravagantly talented Smith \u2013 is now played by Doctor Who\u2019s Freema Agyeman.

When the first trailer for the upcoming Super Mario Bros Movie teased his vocal performance as the overall-clad plumber of 8-bit repute, fans began gnashing their teeth harder than a thicket of piranha plants, outraged to hear that he\u2019d eschewed the character\u2019s distinctive spicy-meat-a-ball accent in favor of a more dialed-back Noo Yawkah dialect. Which is fair enough, those little cries of <em>wa-hoo! </em>probably would\u2019ve gotten old after an hour or so, not to mention the inevitable backlash from Italian anti-discrimination activists. The integral Mario-ness of his performance comes and goes, to the point that most of the time, he just sounds like Chris Pratt. He\u2019s not horrible in the role, but there\u2019s not really anything to recommend him as the right match for this specific character, either.</p><p>It\u2019s not long before a viewer realizes that the overt presence of Pratt must have surely been the point of casting him, a notion more apparent in Anya Taylor-Joy\u2019s minimal-effort line-reads as Princess Peach. She makes zero attempt to transform her voice, or to introduce a more animated quality to brighten up her normal speech. A charitable viewer might suggest that her slight smoker\u2019s rasp befits the film\u2019s baldfaced goal to present a less bubbly, more grounded take on the ruler of the Mushroom Kingdom, but all the same, she doesn\u2019t bring much to the table in terms of individual intangibles. These deficiencies in her and Pratt\u2019s underwhelming approach to cartoonifying themselves jump right out whenever Jack Black\u2019s Bowser occupies the screen, a glaring reminder of what good voice acting feels like. Cannily chosen for his boisterous roar capable of turning on a dime into an absurd little tenderness, Black massages a growly undercurrent into his readings and invites the supervillain\u2019s Broadway-caliber theatricality to run away with him.

Many of us feel too \u201cburnt-out, tired and under pressure to participate in civic life\u201d, according to a new study that points to the scale of the problem. \u201cThe symptoms of a manic modern world are real, but the diagnosis is wrong.

We live at this \u201chigher tempo,\u201d because we are shamed if we fall behind, and praised for keeping up, even when it harms us. That\u2019s how we came to believe our experience of stress is a necessary and noble sacrifice that humans make in service of the great and mighty economy, which matters more than the lives of us mere mortals.

For it was the spectacular landscapes of the desert state that so enraptured <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/dec/05/olivier-messiaen-centenary\">Olivier Messiaen</a> on a visit in 1973 that he decided the work he had been commissioned to compose to mark the US bicentenary in 1976 would be a celebration not only of its natural beauties and colours, but also of the birds that inhabit it. Fifty years after that visit, the Utah orchestra and its music director <a href=\"https://www.thierryfischer.com/\">Thierry Fischer</a> performed Messiaen\u2019s longest orchestral work in the very canyons that prompted the epic score, and subsequently made this recording.</p><p>In the 12 movements of Des Canyons, depictions of the Utah landscapes and, inevitably for Messiaen, the feelings of religious wonder that they inspired alternate with musical portraits of the birds \u2013 \u201cGod\u2019s musicians\u201d as he describes them \u2013 that sing there or sometimes elsewhere in the world. Each location and each bird is precisely identified in the titles of the movements; there\u2019s Cedar Breaks and the Gift of Awe, Bryce Canyon and the Red-Orange Rocks, The Orioles, The Wood Thrush and (an African bird) The White-Browed Robin-Chat, and movements too that hint at the great beyond to which so much of Messiaen\u2019s music aspires, such as the final Zion Park and the Celestial City.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/06/messiaen-des-canyons-aux-etoiles-review-epic-score-soars-in-utahs-superb-recording\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/06/messiaen-des-canyons-aux-etoiles-review-epic-score-soars-in-utahs-superb-recording", "date_published": "2023-04-06 14:00:25+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "State actor still main suspect behind Nord Stream sabotage, says investigator", "description": "<p>Swedish prosecutor casts doubt over theories that independent group was responsible for pipeline blasts</p><p>The Swedish prosecutor investigating the Nord Stream sabotage attack has said the \u201cclear main scenario\u201d was that a state-sponsored group had been involved, seemingly casting doubt over theories that posited an independent group was responsible for the pipeline blasts.</p><p>Mats Ljungqvist told Reuters on Thursday that though a non-state-backed plot was still theoretically possible, the type of explosive used in the bombings ruled out a \u201clarge portion of actors\u201d.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/06/nord-stream-sabotage-pipeline-blasts\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/06/nord-stream-sabotage-pipeline-blasts", "date_published": "2023-04-06 13:54:22+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Man found guilty of murdering pregnant wife at Arthur\u2019s Seat", "description": "<p>Kashif Anwar, 29, pushed Fawziyah Javed, 31, off Edinburgh hill, leading to death of wife and unborn child</p><p>A man has been found guilty of murdering his pregnant wife by pushing her off the edge of Arthur\u2019s Seat in Edinburgh.</p><p>Kashif Anwar, 29, was found guilty by a jury at the high court in Edinburgh of murdering Fawziyah Javed, 31, in September 2021 by pushing her from the hill, causing her multiple blunt-force injuries and ultimately her death, and that of her unborn child.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/06/man-found-guilty-of-murdering-pregnant-wife-at-arthurs-seat\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/06/man-found-guilty-of-murdering-pregnant-wife-at-arthurs-seat", "date_published": "2023-04-06 13:51:34+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "NEU threatens \u2018biggest demo Manchester has seen for ages\u2019 during Tory conference", "description": "<p>National Education Union says government is \u2018rattled\u2019 after delegates vote for strike action in England in summer term</p><p>The National Education Union\u2019s leadership has threatened to organise a huge protest during the Conservative party conference, accusing Gillian Keegan, the education secretary, of being deluded about teachers\u2019 pay and staff shortages.</p><p>The NEU\u2019s joint general secretary Kevin Courtney told delegates at the union\u2019s annual conference: \u201cIf you need to, you will organise the biggest demo Manchester has seen for decades on 2 October, you\u2019ll carry on a campaign right into the general election year.

At one time, early Homo sapiens shared the Earth (and interbred with) the stronger, larger-brained and equally artistic Neanderthals, as well as the hobbit-like Denisovans. What happened to them? It could be, as some argue, that we simply killed them all, or that they were somehow less well able to adapt to climate change.
