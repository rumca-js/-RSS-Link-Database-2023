The YA-novel-turned-film-series craze was still raging on in the mid 2010’s and the Maze Runner movies definitely rode that wave. Based on the James Dashner series, the movies kind of… did their own thing? 

Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials definitely raises some questions. Like where are the trials? Why was one of the most suspicious-looking actors cast when someone trustworthy would have helped drive the twist home? Where are the mazes, and why is nobody running in them?! Is Minho trying to get himself kiled?!

To answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials
