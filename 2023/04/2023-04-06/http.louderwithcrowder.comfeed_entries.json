Which is much better than the <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/gym-bro-dog-cat-food\" target=\"_self\">TikTok gym bro </a>who ate wet cat food for the gainz. That video is forever burned into my retinas. </p><p>Twenty-four-year-old Manon Alias Onboou of France has gotten millions of <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jamaal-bowman-tiktok-racism-hearing\" target=\"_blank\">TikTok</a> views by showing her fans just how much fat she consumes on a daily basis. Onboou actually said she's recovering from an eating disorder, and that eating copious amounts of fat helps her ward off panic attacks: <em>\u201cI started eating butter and chocolate together whenever my eating disorders got worse, because I would simply empty my pantry otherwise.\" </em></p><p>In one video, she showed her fans a haul of four days-worth of groceries and unloaded 18 packages of butter and four bottles of oil. If this really is just for four days, that means she eats 4.5 packages of butter and a bottle of oil per day. The comments of her TikTok reflected the shock of her viewers, with many asking why she eats so much butter. There are also many comments wishing her well and offering her support in her recovery. </p><p><br /></p><blockquote cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@onbooudespates/video/7207380559666875654\" class=\"tiktok-embed\">\n<section>\n<a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@onbooudespates\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"@onbooudespates\">@onbooudespates</a>\n<p></p>\n</section>\n</blockquote>\n<p><br /></p><p>She said that the super sweet combo helps her avoid binging, and she wants to share her diet online to feel less alone as she recovers from her eating disorder:<em> \"Although many people suffer from this, I used to hide myself and feel ashamed, as well as guilty. </em><em>For those who don\u2019t suffer, it allows them to see the living hell some people go through and possibly be more aware of pathological behaviors they could notice from their friends. I like showing the reality that the path to recovery is not linear \u2013 it doesn\u2019t go from everything to nothing.\u201d</em></p><p>I wish Onboou well in her recovery. It seems that when people recover from eating disorders, they often go through periods of disordered eating habits other than restriction before they begin to eat normally again - so perhaps that's what she's going through now. I hope she will soon get to a healthier place physically and mentally, and hopefully adopt a more typical diet. With just a <em>tad</em> less butter. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Lily is a Zoomer college dropout who somehow landed a writing gig here at LwC.com.

The (unintentional) entertainment value of that show is unmatched. </p><p>The ladies were discussing a poll that found 77% of <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/gen-z-womens-prisons\" target=\"_blank\">Gen Z'ers</a> backed Democrats for Congress. Which, as a fellow Zoomer myself, hurts my heart. We gotta step it up, gang. </p><p>But Behar had some interesting opinions as to why the youngest voting generation chose Democrats - guns, abortion, and...tornadoes. Yes, tornadoes. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cJoy Behar declares \"this is the end of the Republican Party\" and they're NEVER \"going to win elections anymore in this country.\"\\nShe claims the GOP is going back to 1897.\\nShe blames the GOP for school shootings and tornados.\\u201d</div> \u2014 Nicholas Fondacaro (@Nicholas Fondacaro)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NickFondacaro/status/1643995120109486081\">1680793955</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Behar also claimed this is the end of the Republican Party and Republicans will never win any elections any more.

I don't want to get killed in school. I don't want to be, you know, in the middle of another tornado or whatever the hell is going on in this country. All I hear about are tornadoes all the time.\" </em></p><p>Uhh...what. </p><p>Behar seemed to quickly realize her claim made no sense. But she already said it on live television, so she had to go full steam ahead with pinning natural disasters on the Republican Party. So she asked her fellow panelists if the recent tornadoes are due to climate change, and they all reassured her that yes, they are. <em>Definitely</em>. In fact, I heard Josh Hawley is personally brewing up another whopper of a storm as we speak. Just to be that way. </p><p>She then claimed young women want their abortion \"rights,\" just in case. Just in case they do that thing that leads to a baby, and end up creating a baby. Gotta have that \"murder\" option on the back burner. </p><p>And unfortunately, this claim might actually be true. Abortion seems to be a sacred \"right\" for many women in this country. Not so sure about the tornadoes, though. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Lily is a Zoomer college dropout who somehow landed a writing gig here at LwC.com.

But that's fine. </p><p>The Boston Police were then called to the hotel, and they confirmed it was a training exercise gone awry. But don't worry, folks. Though this may sound terrifying, the FBI reiterated that \"safety\" is ALWAYS their main priority: \"Safety is always a priority of the FBI, and our law enforcement partners, and we take these incidents very seriously.

So of course we have to cover it here at Louder with Crowder dot com. </p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/pennsylvania-dead-representative\" target=\"_blank\">Pennsylvania</a> man named Tony Saunders <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/pink-haired-shoplifter\" target=\"_blank\">stole</a> a school bus on Tuesday. Which is strange enough as it is. Why would anyone steal a school bus? They're quite difficult to drive and, as far as stolen vehicles go, they might just be the <em>least</em> inconspicuous option. I'm not in any way advocating criminal activity. But if you're going to steal a vehicle, why go with the bright yellow, 20,000 pound one? Rookie mistake. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cPennsylvania man gets naked and steals a school bus to haul his dead deer home https://t.co/4JIRAlCBb7\\u201d</div> \u2014 Not the Bee (@Not the Bee)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Not_the_Bee/status/1643724419507027968\">1680729415</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Anyway, police chased Saunders in the school bus across three counties. At one point during the chase, Saunders drove over a berm and nearly flipped the bus. So it got pretty intense. </p><p>Saunders eventually parked the bus on a neighborhood street, got out, and began running. As he ran, he stripped off his clothing until he was butt-naked. (I'm telling you now. This detail is never explained. We just have to accept his nakedness.) </p><p>He continued to run through parking lots and busy areas until police caught up with him and arrested him. Still fully-naked. Saunders then admitted to stealing the bus after he crashed a BMW. </p><p>But wait, there's more: Saunders told police there was a dead deer inside the bus. He was trying to bring it home to fertilize his garden. As one does.</p><p>He is currently being held at the York County Prison for fleeing an officer, receiving stolen property, reckless driving, and resisting arrest. </p><p>Pennsylvanians, what's going on in your state? I've been there many times and never saw anything this wild. But I must say, I do hope Saunders's garden survives his stint in jail. He risked a lot for those plants. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Lily is a Zoomer college dropout who somehow landed a writing gig here at LwC.com.

Even though it's the entire point of <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/subway-cadbury-creme-egg-sabdwich\" target=\"_blank\">Easter</a>, it seems some would rather focus on a life-size rabbit that breaks into your home in the middle of the night and hides eggs for your children.

This wouldn't have happened in my time at Brumby's. You can't have Easter without hot cross buns. They've been synonymous with Easter celebrations since the 12th century in England.\"</em></p><p>Hot Cross Buns are traditionally eaten on Good Friday to mark the end of Lent. They are little buns filled with spices and dried fruit (usually raisins or currants) and topped with a \"cross\" of frosting. I've made them before, and they're...not great, in my opinion. I much prefer cinnamon rolls. But that may be due to my childish tastebuds. </p><p>It's baffling but unfortunately not surprising that even just the symbol of the cross is now deemed too offensive for Easter. Even though the cross is absolutely central to Easter. At least people are still calling out this madness instead of just accepting it as the \"new normal\". That fact alone gives me hope that we can come back from all the woke, anti-Christian insanity. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Lily is a Zoomer college dropout who somehow landed a writing gig here at LwC.com.

Let's see Dylan film her workouts at the gym, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/gym-shamer-girl-tiktok\" target=\"_blank\">catch dudes checking her out</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/twitch-streamer-gym\" target=\"_blank\">gym shame them</a> for it. May the deity or deities of content, in their divine wisdom, make it so.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.
