<ul><li>Three players tied on seven under after opening round</li><li>Rahm recovers after four-putting first hole</li></ul><p>Greg Norman may have the last laugh. Given the<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/18/greg-norman-golf-documentary-espn-masters-1996" title=""> trauma Augusta National caused the Australian</a> during his playing days, it would surely be an almighty roar.</p><p>Norman’s position front and centre of LIV’s disruption model means that a description of him as persona non grata at the Masters feels like the understatement of the year. The means for the former world No 1 to get even rather than mad lies in the hands of LIV converts. Enter Brooks Koepka, who made birdies on three of his final four holes to join the day-one leaders party at seven under par.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/apr/07/the-masters-brooks-koepka-crashes-party-leaders-jon-rahm-and-viktor-hovland">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For too long, the plant world has laughed at our puffy faces and runny noses. Finally there’s a plan to stop them</p><p>We should all realise by now that nature hates us. Plants use their roots to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/may/02/plants-talk-to-each-other-through-their-roots">whisper among themselves</a>, according to the latest research, conspiring underground, plotting our destruction. They “prompt their neighbours to grow more aggressively, presumably to avoid being left in the shade”. That sounds like a rather charitable presumption to me. We underestimate their capacity for nefarious scheming at our peril. And they save their nastiest trick for this time of year.</p><p>We fall for it every time. “See how pretty we are!”, they say. “Wonder at our divine colours, marvel at our sublime textures; how delicate is our beauty! Love us.” It is an act of the damnedest subterfuge, for this is the time of year they also just happen to start bellowing out their Powder of Deep Suffering, which they would rather we call pollen.

<p>Sweden’s Niklas Edin, the six-time world men’s curling champion skip, made what is being called "the greatest shot in curling history" at the World Men's Curling Championship. Sweden, who were trailing by two points to Norway in the 10th end, needed to score two points with their last shot to force an extra end. His attempt, made with huge amounts of spin on the stone, is an unusual sight at the top level and successfully levelled the scores by the finest of margins.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2023/apr/06/niklas-edin-stuns-with-spin-world-mens-curling-championship-video">Continue reading...</a>
