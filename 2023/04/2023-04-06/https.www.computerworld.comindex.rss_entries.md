<p>A group of influential and informed tech types recently put forward <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3691639/tech-big-wigs-hit-the-brakes-on-ai-rollouts.html">a formal request that AI rollouts be paused</a> for six months. I certainly understand concerns that artificial intelligence is advancing too fast, but trying to stop it in its tracks is a recurring mistake made by people who should know better.</p><p>Once a technology takes off, it’s impossible to hold back, largely because there’s no strong central authority with the power to institute a global pause — and no enforcement entity to ensure the pause directive is followed. </p><p>The right approach would be to create such an authority beforehand, so there’s some way to assure the intended outcome. I tend to agree with former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates that the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/bill-gates-says-calls-pause-ai-wont-solve-challenges-2023-04-04/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">focus should be on assuring AI reliability</a>, not trying to pause everything.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3693048/pausing-ai-development-is-a-foolish-idea.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p>Well, gang, it happened. Again.</p><p>I, an alleged human who lives and breathes all things Android, just realized I'd gone <em>months</em> without activating one of the platform's most powerful and pleasant personalization options.</p><p>This time, though, I spotted a pattern.</p><p>Late last year, y'see, I moved into a new Android device — the perky and praiseworthy <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3676694/google-pixel-7-settings.html">Pixel 7 Pro</a>. And as part of that migration into a different digital home, I inadvertently left this bit of advanced customization behind.</p><p>It isn't the first time, I now realize. Virtually <em>every </em>time I've moved into a new phone over the past few years, this same maddening slip has transpired. And virtually every time, it takes me anywhere from several weeks to the better part of a year to notice and then gently plop me palm against me noggin in frustration.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3692300/android-personalization.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
