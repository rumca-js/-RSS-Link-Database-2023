It's quite appalling. First there was the <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/simply-naked-dutch\" target=\"_blank\">Dutch show</a> that had children ask questions about adult's naked bodies and tried to pretend everything was normal. Now, this - the UK's \"Naked Education\". </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201c'Being naked is not a bad thing at all.'\\n\\nNormalising all bodies, a groundbreaking new series, Naked Education starts Tuesday at 8pm.

And the show recently featured two people who surgically mutilated themselves to try and become the opposite gender. Of course. </p><p>The two stars, Finlay Games and Lucian Main, showed off their double mastectomy scars. After that fun was over, Finlay decided to up the ante a little and reveal their \"neo-penis.\"  For those of you trans rookies out there, a \"neo-penis\" is constructed when a woman who wants to be a man has doctors remove tissue from her forearm or thigh and create a phallic mass of tissue. To attach \"down there\". </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cTrans-identified women paraded naked, with mastectomy scars, full phalloplasty made from arm flesh, on UK show \"Naked Education\"\\n\\nhttps://t.co/USaC5AFZA5\\u201d</div> \u2014 The Post Millennial (@The Post Millennial)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TPostMillennial/status/1649085560865140737\">1682007610</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Finlay claimed the neo-penis is fully functional alongside a pump device that resembles a deflated balloon: \"I have a saline solution in my abdomen in a little kind of reservoir, and in this testicle, I have a pump, and when I pump, the saline solution goes through and into my penis and gives me an erection and then I have a button there to let it back out again.\"</p><p>Finlay then turned to the audience of youngsters and explained how nerves from their forearm were removed and connected to nerves in their pelvis to try and provide the neo-penis with full sensation. Finlay claimed that, because of this, they can achieve orgasm. </p><p>What the show left out, however, was that Finlay actually had to undergo six surgeries due to severe complications and has long battled depression. These inconvenient facts were pointed out by science documentary producer Malcolm Clark over on Twitter. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201c7./ What hypocrisy for Channel 4  to make a fuss about being honest about our bodies and then present such a one-sided and therefore dishonest portrayal of Finn's story.

He then brought up how PETA actually kills a lot of animals. In 2021, PETA's Virginia shelter alone killed 50,000 animals. The Virginia Department of Agriculture identified the shelter in Norfolk as, \"the single largest killer of animals in the state.\" This is a fact everyone brushes over, but PETA euthanizes animals at an exponentially higher rate than other places whose job it is to re-home animals. </p><p>Crowder then highlighted how in 2022 alone, PETA killed over 2,000 dogs and cats with a 74% kill rate in their shelter, and a 2.1% adoption rate. He contrasted this with the rates of an average Virginia shelter - 74.5% adoption rate, and a 5.2% kill rate. Crowder then brought up a 2014 Virginia law that defined a private animal shelter as \"a facility operated for the purpose of finding permanent adoptive homes for animals.\" PETA then lobbied against this bill. Crowder explained how, not only does PETA kill at an astronomically high rate, they used their millions in funding to lobby for the ability to continue killing animals at an astronomically high rate. </p><p>Today is the last day you can catch the entire show, MugClub included, for free over on Rumble.

Now, he totally lost his composure on air when a guest disagreed with him on historical facts. </p><p>Presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy joined Lemon and Poppy Harlow yesterday morning, but the segment ended abruptly due to Don's palpable anger. Ramaswamy and Lemon were discussing Ramaswamy's recent NRA speech, during which he said: \"We fought a civil war in this country to give black Americans the equal protection under the law that we failed to secure them in 1776. But then, you want to know what happened? Southern states passed anti-gun laws that stopped black people from owning guns; the Democrat Party, then as in now, wanted to put them back in chains.\"</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cCNN's @donlemon BATTLES @VivekGRamaswamy over the Civil War and gun rights.\\n\\nREAD: https://t.co/i2gHaHaZJK\\u201d</div> \u2014 Washington Examiner (@Washington Examiner)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dcexaminer/status/1648788290357665792\">1681936736</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When Harlow asked him why the Democrat Party <em>currently</em> wants to put black people in chains, Ramaswamy explained how the sentiment dates back to the policies of LBJ's Great Society: \"The very policies that we implemented in this country in the name of helping black Americans have actually been disastrous for black Americans and all Americans, and I think that that\u2019s something that we need to wake up to.\" </p><p>Lemon responded that he doesn't see what the Civil War has to do with gun rights, and Ramaswamy explained how \"black people did not get to enjoy the other freedoms until their Second Amendment rights were secured.\" But Lemon argued that black people still don't enjoy freedoms. And then told Ramaswamy he actually can't talk about this at all, because he isn't black.</p><p>I don't think this guy is going to be the 2024 candidate. But he's gaining some notoriety, and this little spar with Don Lemon will certainly help with that. I also don't understand why Don Lemon was so offended at the suggestion that gun rights may have helped black Americans. But then again, I'm not black. So, according to Don, I can't even discuss these things. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Lily is a Zoomer college dropout who somehow landed a writing gig here at LwC.com.

Now, he totally lost his composure on air when a guest disagreed with him on historical facts. </p><p>Presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy joined Lemon and Poppy Harlow yesterday morning, but the segment ended abruptly due to Don's palpable anger. Ramaswamy and Lemon were discussing Ramaswamy's recent NRA speech, during which he said: \"We fought a civil war in this country to give black Americans the equal protection under the law that we failed to secure them in 1776. But then, you want to know what happened? Southern states passed anti-gun laws that stopped black people from owning guns; the Democrat Party, then as in now, wanted to put them back in chains.\"</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cCNN's @donlemon BATTLES @VivekGRamaswamy over the Civil War and gun rights.\\n\\nREAD: https://t.co/i2gHaHaZJK\\u201d</div> \u2014 Washington Examiner (@Washington Examiner)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dcexaminer/status/1648788290357665792\">1681936736</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When Harlow asked him why the Democrat Party <em>currently</em> wants to put black people in chains, Ramaswamy explained how the sentiment dates back to the policies of LBJ's Great Society: \"The very policies that we implemented in this country in the name of helping black Americans have actually been disastrous for black Americans and all Americans, and I think that that\u2019s something that we need to wake up to.\" </p><p>Lemon responded that he doesn't see what the Civil War has to do with gun rights, and Ramaswamy explained how \"black people did not get to enjoy the other freedoms until their Second Amendment rights were secured.\" But Lemon argued that black people still don't enjoy freedoms. And then told Ramaswamy he actually can't talk about this at all, because he isn't black.</p><p>I don't think this guy is going to be the 2024 candidate. But he's gaining some notoriety, and this little spar with Don Lemon will certainly help with that. I also don't understand why Don Lemon was so offended at the suggestion that gun rights may have helped black Americans. But then again, I'm not black. So, according to Don, I can't even discuss these things. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Lily is a Zoomer college dropout who somehow landed a writing gig here at LwC.com.

A corporation that has made it clear it doesn't care about a) theft, and b) you. Stolen merchandise can be written off. Your attempt to stop a thief could be a liability risk. This old man did what he thought was right and there is more of a chance of him getting fired for it than for the company to acknowledge his heroism. There's also an above-average chance his bosses voted for and donated money to the elected officials who support policies that have caused the increase in crime.</p><p>Worry about your family that wants to see you home safe. That matters more than this random scumbag.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

One is that <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lia-thomas-biden-title-ix\" target=\"_blank\">she shared a Riley Gaines tweet</a>. Riley as of late has turned into Vice-Head Transphobe In Charge behind JK Rowling. </p><p>Second, unlike her colleague Sage Steele, Ponder is someone assumed to be more on the left. She is believed to have been the catalyst in getting Barstool Sports kicked off of the network after one episode of \"Van Talk.\"</p><p>Third is that ESPN is a media network that cares more about getting that sweet ESG boost by pandering to woke politics than they care about things like \"sports.\" So much so, Lia Thomas <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/lia-thomas-espn-womens-history\" target=\"_blank\">was featured in their video saluting \"Women's\" history month.</a></p><p>By the time you read this, the entire post can be moot. And Ponder was cyberbullied into an apology by trans activists and other domestic terrorists. My thinking is that Ponder knew what she was doing when she chose a Riley Gaines tweet to retweet and WANTED to speak out. We'll see if she stands by it.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.
