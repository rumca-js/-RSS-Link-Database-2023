<p><strong>Prince Edward theatre, London<br /></strong>This plodding account of the Motown band’s highs and lows is more than a little soulless</p><p>A musical about the Temptations was always going to have a phenomenal songbook. The band became one of the most celebrated Motown acts of the 1960s and 70s and this production is stuffed full of their hits, such as Shout, My Girl and Papa Was a Rollin’ Stone – all of which sound red hot to this day.</p><p>The actors sing with vigour and perform the athletic dance moves that made the group so distinctive, with nice period choreography by Sergio Trujillo. But the narrative in Dominique Morisseau’s book, which should bring these men to life, feels so skating, sketchy and divorced from the songbook that the production feels hollowed of an emotional centre. Rarely has a show of its kind felt more like a jukebox musical-by-numbers.</p><p>At the <a href="https://london.ainttooproudmusical.com/">Prince Edward theatre, London</a>, until 1 October</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/apr/21/aint-too-proud-review-a-temptations-jukebox-musical-by-numbers">Continue reading...</a>

That the Saints sat eighth in the table going into this game tells you everything you needed to know about their results and performances this season to date.</p><p>But here, against a side who have set the pace so far in 2023 – just as the Saints have in recent years – the champions underlined how their grip on the title they have held for over 1,000 days will not be relinquished that easily. Despite missing well over 1,200 games worth of experience due to injuries and suspensions, with a glut of frontline internationals including a good chunk of their starting pack unavailable, Paul Wellens’ side delivered their best performance of the season ahead of next week’s international break to inflict back-to-back defeats on a Warrington side who were unbeaten less than a week ago.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/apr/20/st-helens-warrington-super-league-rugby-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

There were nine minutes left on a wild, noisy night when David de Gea, a long way from his line, stumbled and fell, leaving the ball at the feet of Youssef En-Nesyri and the goal at his mercy.

Manchester United had scored two of them in the first leg, and assisted the rest here.</p><p>En-Nesyri got two of them, Loïc Badé the other on a night – two nights in fact – that were an extraordinary act of self-destruction.

The charge could result in a two-year ban for the British boxer who has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/apr/18/conor-benn-boxing-comeback-thrown-into-doubt-as-provisional-ukad-suspension-revealed" title="">trying to resume his troubled career</a> abroad without clearing his name in public first.</p><p>This latest development marks a further hardening in Ukad’s approach to the case, which first made news last October when, in the week of his planned and heavily hyped fight against Chris Eubank Jr, it emerged that Benn had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/oct/06/conor-benn-v-chris-eubank-jr-fight-finally-called-off-after-day-of-wrangling" title="">returned a positive test result for clomifene</a>. Despite initial efforts to proceed with the bout, the media and public uproar forced its cancellation. Later that month Benn admitted he had also returned a second and earlier positive test result for clomifene. Both these results were recorded by Vada (the Voluntary Anti-Doping Authority) and, while Benn had not failed any Ukad tests, the British agency took serious note of the two separate positives.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/apr/20/conor-benn-was-charged-with-alleged-clomifene-use-in-april-confirms-ukad">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Supporters hoped the president might help the country to move forward. Instead, he has put it into reverse</p><p>The arrest of Tunisia’s leading opposition figure, Rached Ghannouchi, is a bleak moment. Profound disenchantment has been widespread for years domestically, as democratic reforms hit a wall, corruption remained entrenched and the economic picture deteriorated. Nonetheless, the country was an important if imperfect symbol of freedom: not only the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2021/jan/25/how-the-arab-spring-unfolded-a-visualisation" title="">birthplace</a> of the Arab spring, but seemingly its sole success story. Tunisia moved from Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali’s autocratic rule to democracy with a thriving civil society and lively media, while others descended into anarchy, bloodshed and brutal repression. The ascent of Ennahda, which transitioned from Islamist movement to mainstream political party, stood as proof that violent extremism was not the only way to challenge authoritarian rule.</p><p>But Tunisia failed to <a href="https://radiopublic.com/on-the-middle-east-with-amberin-z-6vJwBM/s1!80e7a" title="">embed democracy</a> with the rule of law – for example, failing to establish a supreme court.

It is a radical and noble vision, but strictly speaking, not socialist. Rawls’s theory is grounded in and a reworking of the “social contract” tradition in political theory.</p><p>That tradition constructs a thought experiment with, as its fundamental assumption, self-seeking individuals who bargain and agree on political (and in Rawls’s case social and economic) institutions in order to end the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellum_omnium_contra_omnes" title="">war of all against all</a>”. Rawls imagines this bargain taking place in an “original position” behind a “veil of ignorance”, designed to ensure that the bargain will be fair to all, and that no individual will be able to choose institutions that privilege himself or herself. To reiterate, his theory of justice as fairness is in its foundations an individualist theory.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/apr/20/im-all-for-rawls-but-labour-must-not-forget-its-true-socialist-roots">Continue reading...</a>

## Animals review – a carnival of curious fish and fantastic beasts

<p><strong>British Library, London<br /></strong>From a medieval monk mixed with a fish to the call of an extinct Hawaiian bird, this entertaining show revels in nature’s marvels – real or otherwise</p><p>In 1255, the King of France gave Henry III of England an elephant; a sensation for medieval eyes that drew crowds to the royal menagerie at the Tower of London, including the artist, chronicler and Benedictine monk Matthew Paris. The picture Paris drew from life shows with clarity how the elephant has its leg tied to a post, how it stands imprisoned and wearily spurts water from its trunk. He shades the ridges and rumples on its vast body, as he tries to accurately depict this creature that’s stepped out of fable.</p><p>This 13th-century portrait of an elephant encapsulates the paradoxical delights of the British Library’s cornucopia of animal art. To medieval folk, an elephant was a monstrous legendary beast from their myths of faraway lands – yet Paris pins this fantastic being to reality, tying it down with his objective gaze. From this early attempt at scientific natural history, to a tiny drawing of a bird in flight from Leonardo da Vinci’s Codex Arundel, to Ludwig Koch’s pioneering 1953 gramophone record of British bird songs, Animals explores how human beings have sought to observe and understand our fellow species. Yet it also revels in the fabulous, impossible dreams we have made of them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/20/animals-review-british-library-london">Continue reading...</a>

## British Black women die in childbirth at an appalling rate. I’m tired of fighting a racist system in vain | Candice Braithwaite

<p>Black women are four times more likely than white women to die giving birth.

This comes as little surprise to me. Every year, I and other Black commentators who feel passionately about these disgusting racial disparities in maternal outcomes are rolled out to condemn the latest figures that point to Black women dying at disproportionate rates.

<p>The new first minister has to be ruthless towards those who presided over the SNP’s current crisis if he is to win back trust</p><p>Almost seven years ago, David Cameron raised liberal hackles when he hummed a happy tune after resigning as prime minister and leaving other politicians – and the country – to clean up his Brexit mess. At that time, Nicola Sturgeon was riding high on the moral high ground, pitting her vision of an independent Scotland within the EU against Cameron’s cynical squandering of the UK’s membership. Today, the moral high ground has crumbled under her feet, and her own cynicism is unmistakable. Like Cameron, Sturgeon left her post with a breezy goodbye. But her successor, unlike Theresa May, who knew she would have to deliver on the leave vote, was not privy to the carnage trailing in Sturgeon’s wake.</p><p>Succeeding her was never going to be easy, but Humza Yousaf’s haunted expression suggests he had no idea of the toxicity of the chalice being offered him by those who purported to be friends.

<p><strong>Royal Festival Hall, London<br /></strong>Uncompromising performances of works by Hindemith, Prokofiev and Ustvolskaya glimmered with tension and beauty<strong><br /></strong></p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/vladimir-jurowski">Vladimir Jurowski’</a>s programme for his latest London Philharmonic concert was a typically uncompromising one. In the broader context of the themes of home, belonging and exile that dominate the orchestra’s current season, he focused on the mid-20th century, specifically on works composed around the second world war. Hindemith’s Violin Concerto, written in 1939 after its composer fled Nazi Germany, was flanked by the dark, post-war uncertainties of Prokofiev’s Sixth Symphony (1946) and Galina Ustvolskaya’s Symphonic Poem No 1 (1958).</p><p>Ustvolskaya studied with Shostakovich, and her work, like his, was frequently propelled by a search for individualism and integrity amid Soviet proscriptions and orthodoxies. By 1958, she hadn’t quite found the abrasive personal voice that the authorities later deemed suspect, though Symphonic Poem No 1 at once parodies the fixities of official optimism and gazes back to the hieratic chants, bells and rituals of the Russian church. Jurowski’s performance, with its gathering tensions and bitter nostalgia, was a forceful reminder that we don’t hear her music as often as we should.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/20/london-philharmonic-orchestra-jurowski-review-gil-shaham-violin-royal-festival-hall">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Hereford Cathedral</strong> <br />Catholic recusant William Byrd’s genius was meticulously and resonantly brought to life, with two thoughtful and effective tribute pieces by Dobrinka Tabakova</p><p>William Byrd has been core to <a href="https://thesixteen.com/">the Sixteen’</a>s repertoire since the group’s inception and, in this year, the 400th anniversary of his death, he is the natural focus of their annual Choral Pilgrimage. Byrd’s genius is perennial, but the particular interest in the programme that conductor <a href="https://www.harrisonparrott.com/artists/harry-christophers">Harry Christophers</a> has so meticulously put together is the interlinking of works by Dutch and Flemish composers who specifically influenced Byrd, as well as two new pieces commissioned from <a href="https://www.dobrinka.com/about/index.htm">Dobrinka Tabakova</a> in memorial tribute.</p><p>Byrd’s Arise Lord Into Thy Rest and Turn Our Captivity O Lord appeared in his last publication, the 1611 volume, Psalmes, Songs and Sonnets, translations of Latin texts by the Catholic <a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/verstegan-richard-rowlands">Richard Verstegan</a> and smuggled into England by him. It was these that Tabakova set, creating companion pieces to those of Byrd, with the old preceding the new in each instance. Taking Byrd’s motif of a rising fifth in Arise Lord, but eschewing his polyphonic treatment, Tabakova embroidered her chords with a high melismatic, almost improvisatory, soprano solo line, beautifully sung by <a href="https://julie-cooper.co.uk/">Julie Cooper</a>. In Turn Our Captivity O Lord, Byrd – never predictable – brought a spring and change of pace into the music for the words “with jollity”; tellingly, in Tabakova’s setting – its often eastern-sounding ornamentation in the unison soprano line heard over more static but sometimes pungent harmonies – she opted to treat this as “with joy”, infusing the music’s earlier keening nature with a warm radiance.</p><p>At Llandaff Cathedral on 20 April.

<p>After a bromantic meet-cute with three grizzled veteran musketeers, the young fighter and his new gang journey entertainingly through palace intrigue with some excellent stunts</p><p>There’s not a lot of roistering going on in the cinema right now, but here’s a film which amusingly roisters its heart out. Despite some updated touches – including an LGBT character-shift and a modern-style assassination attempt – this new version in two parts of Alexandre Dumas’s 1844 classic The Three Musketeers is a distinctly old-fashioned entertainment, and entertainment is never easy. A high-gloss French costume movie, it will have devotees of the Netflix talent-agency sitcom Call My Agent! wondering which of that show’s characters are representing which star; it appears to split its two feature-episodes in roughly the place that Richard Lester and screenwriter George Macdonald Fraser divided their Three and Four Musketeers in the 1970s.</p><p>Here is part one, and François Civil stars as D’Artagnan, the 17th-century hopeful who journeys up from the provinces to Paris, yearning to be one of the elite King’s Musketeers. Our young swordsman – only that quaint Freudian term will do – bromantically meets-cute with three grizzled veteran musketeers – Athos (Vincent Cassel), Porthos (Pio Marmaï) and Aramis (Romain Duris) – having in his maladroit bumpkin way accidentally jostled or insulted each of them. Their impetuous three-to-one duel is interrupted by the swaggering paramilitary corps loyal to sinister intriguer Cardinal of Richelieu (Eric Ruf), and our four amigos are united by their detestation of these creepy bullies.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/20/the-three-musketeers-dartagnan-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Durham seamer on being named one of five cricketers of the year, battling for a place in England’s Ashes team and how Ben Stokes gives him confidence</p><p>“It was more formal than I expected it be,” says Matthew Potts, the morning after the night before when, in front of a packed Long Room at Lord’s, amid dickie bows and evening gowns aplenty, the fast bowler was handed a leather-bound Wisden by Mike Brearley as one of the Almanack’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/apr/17/jonny-bairstow-inaugural-winner-new-wisden-trophy-test-award-cricket">five cricketers of the year</a>.</p><p>“You almost can’t believe your luck when a legend like that presents you with it – it was a very special moment,” Potts continues, shortly before leaving London for Cardiff where Durham are playing their third-round fixture against Glamorgan. “I delved into Wisden a few years ago out of curiosity and so I knew a bit about it. But some of the big names who have been in there in the past … well, it’s a huge privilege to be among them.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/apr/20/matthew-potts-england-durham-ive-got-confirmation-i-have-started-out-on-the-right-path">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Buzzin’ Fly/Virgin)</strong><br />Tracey Thorn and Ben Watt have absorbed the revolutions in dance and electronic music since their previous album in 1999, and shaped them into melancholic, finely detailed stories</p><p>This week, Everything But the Girl’s social media accounts posted some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCmfMlRDWwI">previously lost footage of the duo</a> around the time of their debut album, 1984’s Eden. A riot of extravagantly spiked hair, filthy-looking London streets and indoor smoking, the clips act as a time capsule and a reminder of the milieu from which the duo sprang: a grimier, greyer, more earnest 1980s than pop cultural nostalgia – with its rouged new romantics and yuppies bellowing into enormous mobile phones – usually allows.</p><p>It was all a very long time ago. Bands who reform decades on from their breakthrough tend to follow a set path: warmly received live shows playing the hits, followed by a new album designed to evoke fond memories of the way they – and their fans – once were. But Ben Watt and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/tracey-thorn">Tracey Thorn</a> were never a band minded to abide by anything but a desire, as Thorn once put it, “to defy categorisation even at the risk of losing a guaranteed audience”. Eden established them among a wave of artists dubbed new jazz, but they never made an album that sounded like it again: theirs is a back catalogue in which slick modern soul chafes against kitchen-sink-drama indie and deep house, where lavish 60s orchestrations fight for space with drum’n’bass inspired by Peshay and Alex Reece.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/20/everything-but-the-girl-fuse-review-still-staking-out-pops-frontier-after-40-years">Continue reading...</a>

The recorded notes are higher, the voice pinned down in a recording studio just before the testosterone he started taking kicked in.

<p>A dazzling examination of our contradictory attitudes towards the creatures with whom we share the planet</p><p>If we love animals, why do we treat them so badly? This paradox runs like a thematic double helix through Keggie Carew’s fantastic, heartfelt history of human-animal relations. It goes back to cave paintings of animals in prehistoric Spain, whose unexpected accuracy feels simultaneously reverent and predatory. These were the animals the artists hoped to kill. And it stretches into the present day, when “canned hunting” enthusiasts in South Africa may pay £4,000 to shoot a lioness in an enclosure, then a bit extra to cuddle her cubs.</p><p>To the author, this juxtaposition of love and hate is a mystery. Why can’t we make up our minds? Carew made up hers at 12, during an epiphany while out riding her scruffy pony on the beach. In the exhilaration as they raced across the sand, their “energies knotted together” and she realised that she “loved this horse”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/20/beastly-a-new-history-of-animals-and-us-by-keggie-carew-review-loveeat-relationship">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A young crew of protesters come together to destroy a Texas oil pipeline in Daniel Goldhaber’s fiercely watchable film</p><p>Here is a fiercely watchable thriller which had me biting my nails down to the wrists. It is inspired partly by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/18/moral-case-destroying-fossil-fuel-infrastructure">Andreas Malm’s radical eco-activist manifesto</a> of the same title, and partly – in fact, almost pedantically – by the heist classic Reservoir Dogs. A young crew of protesters, each individually getting a backstory flashback which sometimes jumps into the drama at a cliffhanger moment, come together for the big job, knowing each other as little as Tarantino’s colour-coded bad guys and having similar issues around gunshot wound injury and possible disloyalty.</p><p>Director and co-screenwriter Daniel Goldhaber applies a fictional imagination to the first two words in the title of Malm’s book, which argues for direct-action property destruction but is not actually a “how to” bomb-making guide like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/02/american-anarchist-review-author-finally-comes-to-terms-with-his-grisly-creation">William Powell’s 1971 gonzo classic The Anarchist Cookbook</a>; it is still in print and still assuredly being studied by climate activists. Goldhaber’s drama shows how this kind of paramilitary adventure might actually happen, month by month, moment by moment, as well as the kind of people who would be sufficiently motivated or reckless to risk decades in federal prison. They are all drawn together by a plan to blow up a west Texas oil pipeline, disrupt the flow and drive its price ruinously up.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/20/how-to-blow-up-a-pipeline-review-explosively-tarantino-esque-eco-thriller">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After years of campaigning, 11 homes have been built as London’s first community land trust – protected in value from the volatile property market. We meet the people who made it happen</p><p>In the back corner of a council estate in south London once occupied by dingy rows of lock-up garages next to a playground, there now stands a gleaming white brick block of flats. Big balconies jut out from its facade in a staggered grid, while a broad staircase loops up the back, where generous curved landings provide spots to stop and take in the view over the treetops to the skyline beyond.</p><p>At first glance, it’s a familiar sight.

<p>In this pragmatic Rishi Sunak era, a fresh start with China – and an end to bullish Tory sabre-rattlers – is on the cards</p><p>Cleverly by name. And perhaps even Cleverly by nature, too? Judging by his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/apr/18/uk-should-not-pull-the-shutters-down-on-china-says-james-cleverly">Guardian interview</a> this week, and by his step-by-step rebuilding of Britain’s relations with Europe, James Cleverly seems to be quietly cajoling Conservative foreign policy down off the post-Brexit battlements and towards a more recognisably practical and stable place in world affairs. If so, two important questions follow. Where exactly is that new place for Britain? And will the Tory party let him do it?</p><p>The foreign secretary’s interview in Tokyo exemplifies Rishi Sunak-era pragmatism. The interview’s tone is less brazen towards China than anything that any of Cleverly’s recent predecessors would have either wanted or felt able to say. But it is also stronger on mood music than on measurable stuff. It reads in part like an attempt to soothe the ill-feeling provoked by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/12/macron-stands-by-remark-us-allies-not-vassals-china">Emmanuel Macron’s comment</a> that America’s allies should not become its “vassals” in any confrontation with China.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/20/brexiters-china-rishi-sunak-tories">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The justice secretary has faced multiple formal complaints over his dealings with civil servants</p><p>The <strong>Association of School and College Leaders</strong> (ASCL) has said it will hold a formal ballot for national strike action in England for the first time in its history “over the school funding crisis, the erosion of teacher and leader pay and conditions, and consequent staff shortages which are undermining the education system”.</p><p>The union’s executive committee of senior elected members met yesterday afternoon and unanimously decided to move to a formal ballot on strike action, PA Media reports.</p><p>ASCL has never before formally balloted at a national level and this is clearly a very significant step. The fact that we have reached this point reflects the desperate situation regarding inadequate funding, long-term pay erosion, teacher shortages, and the intransigence of a government which we can only conclude does not value the education workforce or recognise the severe pressures facing the sector.</p><p>We have made every effort to resolve this matter through negotiations prior to reaching this point. Unfortunately, the government’s offer has failed to sufficiently address pay and conditions, and, critically, did not provide enough funding for even the meagre proposal it put forward. Following the rejection of the offer by all education unions involved – ASCL, NAHT, NEU and NASUWT – the government has made no effort to reopen negotiations and has said only that the issue of pay will now revert to the school teachers’ review body.</p><p>Speaking to senior folk in government privately, most assume that Mr Raab – who is also justice secretary – is “toast” as one figure put it to me.</p><p>“The breadth of this, the number of people complaining, surely he can’t survive?” said another.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/apr/20/dominic-raab-bullying-report-allegations-rishi-sunak-snp-humza-yousaf-illegal-migration-bill-politics-live">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Inspirational documentary recovers the stories of those who dared to question the treatment of children in a small Irish town</p><p>Irish film-maker and journalist Sinéad O’Shea has a gripping and inspirational story to tell about her home town of Navan in Co Meath, and she tells it terrifically well, talking to the people involved, engaging with the history, delivering the drama and teasing out the poignancies and complexities.</p><p>O’Shea is speaking to the people who stood up to church abuse in the 60s and 70s, at a time when challenging the Catholic authorities seemed unthinkable. There can hardly be anyone left now who doesn’t know something about Ireland’s coming to terms with the historical abuse sanctioned by the church and its treatment of young pregnant women in the brutal mother-and-baby houses and Magdalene Laundries, the subject of movies such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/31/philomena-review">Stephen Frears’s Philomena</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2003/feb/21/artsfeatures1">Peter Mullan’s The Magdalene Sisters</a>. These were the workhouses of shame, or perhaps the refineries in which guilt and fear were extracted as fuel for the theocracy. Schools were the same, with their incessant beatings, carried out by unmarried men who had of course been beaten and humiliated themselves in their formative years: a theatre of cruelty where the punishment was the point. (England has nothing to be smug about: we had teachers routinely assaulting children in front of other children for reasons they perhaps couldn’t explain to themselves.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/20/pray-for-our-sinners-review-the-irish-campaigners-who-took-on-brutal-church-abuse">Continue reading...</a>

Her debut novel, Rosewater,<em> </em>derives from the same ambitions, following 28-year-old queer poet Elsie, who is living in south London and navigating her chaotic work, love and family life.</p><p>The book opens with a literal bang, as bailiffs attempt to evict Elsie from her social housing flat. It’s a powerfully visceral and exposing moment. “I’m left with sixty minutes to pack up my worldly belongings and figure out whatever the fuck I’m supposed to do next,” says Elsie, before moving in with her childhood friend Juliet.

There are works by William Byrd (15 July) and Thomas Weelkes (30 July) to satisfy the early-music enthusiasts, while those who love to indulge in the lusher end of romanticism will relish the number of pieces by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/sergei-rachmaninov">Rachmaninov</a> included to mark the 150th anniversary of his birth, though there’s no sign of any of the operas or even of all of the piano concertos. Followers of 20th-century music will welcome the healthy representation of pieces by Ligeti, including his celebrated Requiem, in his centenary year. Another 100th milestone, marking the Croatian composer Dora Pejačevič’s death, provides the opportunity to explore some of her little known output; and, if the new works and commissions are generally rather disappointing this time, with very few truly outstanding world premieres in prospect, then the rarities dotted throughout the programmes will be some compensation.</p><p><strong>Prom 9: Mariza sings Fado (21 July)</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/20/requiem-to-revolution-via-aeneas-and-kafkas-earplugs-our-10-proms-picks">Continue reading...</a>

## Labour is on the warpath at last. But why is it targeting benefit claimants and disabled people? | Frances Ryan

Those who object to the new tactics are not expressing legitimate critiques, the argument goes – they’re just too soft for the fight. As <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/apr/16/labour-rishi-sunak-attack-ad?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other">one frontbencher put it</a>: “We have come back from Easter ready for a scrap.

The tactic falsely suggests the benefits system is rife with fraud, while framing benefit claimants as the reason other “deserving” people aren’t getting the support they need. It conflates fraud with innocent error, reinforcing the long-term Tory attempt to bloat the figures of benefit fraud.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/20/labour-warpath-targeting-benefit-claimants-disabled-starmer">Continue reading...</a>

## In Her Nature by Rachel Hewitt review – reclaiming the great outdoors

<p>An impressive blend of memoir and history that takes inspiration from the women written out of sporting history</p><p>vRachel Hewitt is not, by her own assertion, great at “technical descents”; those stretches of trail run where solid ground is a distant dream. Here the runner must yield to gravity while simultaneously navigating boulders and scree, often having already climbed great heights over a huge distance, grappling with weather and carrying a pack laden with water, energy bars, spare kit and incontinence pads. To those of us more at home in the great indoors, the mere fact that she is anywhere approaching upright seems miraculous, and it seems unnecessarily self-critical for her to focus on aspects of her performance she views as sub-optimal. Over the course of this deeply impressive, humane synthesis of scholarship, memoir and rallying cry for women and girls to exercise their right to a place in the world, she will consider how limiting it can be to attend too closely to that inner judge. She will also reflect, minutely and thoughtfully, on how women’s greater participation in outdoor life is not curtailed straightforwardly by a lack of self-belief or confidence, but by the threat and reality of male violence and derision.</p><p>Hewitt’s interest lies particularly in the flourishing of 19th-century sportswomen, especially the captivating Lizzie Le Blond, an Anglo-Irish aristocrat who, dispossessed by primogeniture, eschewed conventional marriage and motherhood for a life scaling the rock faces and summits of the Alps. Her climbing career had begun as she rambled over the lower slopes of Switzerland as part of a rest cure for suspected tuberculosis; the nearest thing to suitable gear was riding clothes with high-heeled boots and floppy hats to protect delicate skin from the ravages of the sun. It ended with her installed as the first president of the newly founded Ladies’ Alpine Club, an internationalist organisation dedicated to the promotion of female climbers that rejected, unlike its male counterpart, the feverishly competitive accumulation of records in favour of the supportive sharing of information. (She was also fantastically glamorous, and there is much incidental pleasure to be had in accounts of her gadding about in St Moritz, where she attended a winter ball dressed as an icicle and befriended EF Benson, the creator of Mapp and Lucia.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/20/in-her-nature-by-rachel-hewitt-review-reclaiming-the-great-outdoors">Continue reading...</a>

## Let’s go round again: the ridiculous rise of fifth-anniversary vinyl reissues

<p>With young fans craving vinyl copies of relatively recent releases, the industry is shortening the nostalgia cycle to almost nothing. But how long can this boom really last?</p><p>The remarkable resurgence of vinyl has been one of the biggest stories in the music industry of the past few years. The once-dead format has seen exponential sales growth, with 5.3m records being sold in the UK in 2021 – the highest volume since 1990, roughly when CD sales began to outpace other formats – and record sales in the US up 15.6% year-on-year in the first few weeks of 2023. This Saturday’s Record Store Day will see the usual yearly clamour for limited vinyl editions, with over 400 records by the likes of the 1975, Taylor Swift, Ellie Goulding and more set to go on sale.</p><p>Keen to make the most of a seemingly steady revenue stream, labels have begun increasing production on limited and deluxe repressings of popular albums. Anniversary reissues – once only common to recently remastered records, or albums several decades old – are now becoming popular for releases that are just five years old, such as Cardi B’s Invasion of Privacy, Phoebe Bridgers’ Stranger in the Alps, Lucy Dacus’ Historian and Idles’ Brutalism. They’ve all been repressed in coloured formats or with alternate sleeves in the past two years, often at a slightly increased price point to standard black discs.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/20/lets-go-round-again-the-ridiculous-rise-of-fifth-anniversary-vinyl-reissues">Continue reading...</a>

## The Thanksgiving Play: Broadway’s funniest and most daring new comedy

<p>After being told her work was ‘uncastable’, Indigenous playwright Larissa FastHorse set out to create a show featuring zero minority actors and wrote a scathing satire</p><p>The Thanksgiving Play came into being, more or less, as a dare. When theater companies told Larissa FastHorse that her script featuring Indigenous characters What Would Crazy Horse Do? was virtually “uncastable”, she set out to write a show featuring zero actors from any minority group. In a somewhat dispiriting twist, the stunt worked. The Thanksgiving Play has become one of the most produced pieces of theater in the US.</p><p>The work centers on a quartet of theater nerds who meet in an elementary school classroom to craft a dramatic rendition of the Thanksgiving story that will possess adequate levels of accuracy and sensitivity. When it emerges that the professional actor who was hired to lend an indigenous voice to the writers’ room is not, in fact, Native American, the classroom becomes a frantic workshop of wokeness, and the meta production plunges headlong into a state of absurdity that had viewers at a recent masked matinee howling into their N95s. FastHorse’s work is a scandalously entertaining turducken of identity politics and humor, taking aim at the buffoonery of the white-run theater world and the paralysis that can go hand in hand with over-analysis. Audiences will come for the jokes about virtue signaling and “vegan allyship” and leave with a queasy sense of confusion and self-loathing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/apr/19/the-thanksgiving-play-broadway-new-comedy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>If the judges of the Sony world photography awards can’t tell a fake picture from a real one, what chance do the rest of us have?</p><p>Lying in bed the other morning listening to the radio, I experienced a dark epiphany; I’ve never been much fun in the mornings. There had been problems in Jerusalem, and one side in the conflict had provided video footage supporting its claim that it had been wronged. For my whole life up to this point, I would have been minded to take a look at that video. But now I found myself thinking, why bother? How would I know it showed what it said it showed? How would I know it wasn’t a complete fake? Videos and photos used to mean something concrete, but now you can’t be sure.</p><p>I haven’t enough confidence in my human intelligence to formulate a firm view on the dangers or otherwise of artificial intelligence. What I do know is that before long, we won’t know anything for sure. As it stands, however good a fake might be, you can still just about tell it’s a fake. But only just.

<p>This story of two sisters, played by Josie Lawrence and Tanya Myers, returning home to sort their dead mother’s belongings avoids predictable genres, narratives and characters</p><p>British indie director Jon Sanders creates another of his low-key, thoughtful movies developed through improvisation; it is a static, eccentric chamber piece in some ways, but engaging and pregnant with ideas about mourning and grief. Josie Lawrence and Tanya Myers play Dot and Phoebe, two sisters who have come to the seaside home of their late mother, a singer and entertainer, to confront the daunting task of sorting out all her belongings and theatrical memorabilia.</p><p>This opens up painful memories and psychic wounds: however much they loved her, their mother was serially unfaithful to their father – once with a boyfriend of Phoebe’s – and now they don’t know how to feel. These themes of sexual transgression are strangely echoed in the present action, as if the women’s mother is haunting the property. Their friend Monica (Anna Mottram) who has come to help them, is attracted to Tom (James Northcote), a young man who has been housesitting the property; she feels guilty about her husband, an excellent cameo from the late Bob Goody.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/20/a-clever-woman-review-engagingly-low-key-english-drama-defies-expectations">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Online reviews highlight indefinite waiting times for calls to be answered and policies paid</p><p><strong>My mother, who died last year, took out a whole of life decreasing term assurance policy with Clerical Medical in 1993, worth £195,000, and held in trust for her three children. I’ve had no response from the company since submitting the claim four months ago. I was advised to make a complaint, but eight weeks later it has not even been allocated a claims handler. I have called repeatedly, always with a 30-60 minute waiting time to get through, and have been told variously that there is an IT issue, a technical issue, confusion about the claim, or simply that they don’t know. Clerical Medical seems either to be deliberately obstructing or just ignoring the claim.<br /></strong><em><strong>LG, London</strong></em></p><p>Clerical Medical, part of the Lloyds Banking Group, boasts of a “consistent, dependable” service on its website.

<p>The civilians of Sudan have been trying to throw off military rule for decades, but now find themselves caught in the middle of a deadly power struggle between former allies turned bitter opponents</p><p>When I landed in Khartoum in late February, the city was tense. On the short journey to my family home in the suburbs of Sudan’s capital, our car was stopped twice at checkpoints that in recent months have been erected after midnight. A car full of women – my mother, my sister and me – was clearly not the threat the officers were looking out for, so we were ushered onwards. Those manning the checkpoints were an inconsistent crew. Some were in plainclothes, others in military fatigues, the rest in police uniform. You never quite knew who you were dealing with, or exactly what they were afraid of. The only common feature they shared was a jittery menace. They were keeping a close eye on movements in a city where tensions had been rising between the two most powerful men in the country.</p><p>Sudan’s leader, Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the head of the Sudanese army, and the country’s deputy leader, Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (known as Hemedti), the head of a paramilitary organisation called the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), had been sharing power since late 2021, when they had jointly carried out a coup that had ejected civilians from a transitional government. But their alliance soon frayed and they began to regard each other with suspicion.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/20/sudan-outsider-hemedti-mohamed-hamdan-dagalo-leader-militia-army-war-conflict">Continue reading...</a>

It must have been a sweet reward for years of keeping the faith – in the business and in yourself.</p><p>Now she is back as the lead in a glossy, efficient thriller called The Diplomat. She plays Kate Wyler, the US equivalent of an experienced civil servant, who is bounced by the president and his chief of staff into becoming the new ambassador in the UK. This is in the wake of a British aircraft carrier being attacked in the Middle East, causing many fatalities and inflaming all sorts of tensions between the UK, the US and Iran, which is suspected of carrying out the attack.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/20/the-diplomat-review-this-political-dramas-star-is-as-great-as-martin-sheen-in-the-west-wing">Continue reading...</a>
