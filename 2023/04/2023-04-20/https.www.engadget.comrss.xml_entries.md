<p>Blizzard is giving gamers another chance to try <em>Diablo IV</em> before its official arrival. The game’s Server Slam will give console and PC players 48 hours to explore the prologue and Act I as the publisher prepares its infrastructure for the dungeon crawler’s highly anticipated <a href="https://www.engadget.com/diablo-iv-release-date-030739148.html">June 6th launch</a>.</p><p>The Server Slam will take place from May 12th at 12 PM to May 14th at 12 PM PDT. It will be open to players on Windows PC, PS5 / 4, Xbox Series X / S or Xbox One. The event will support couch co-op, cross-play and cross-progression, and you can play as all five character classes, including Barbarian, Druid, Sorcerer, Rogue and Necromancer.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The two-day event will limit character progression to Level 20, after which you’ll no longer receive Ability Points (but you can still earn new gear). In addition, if you played during the game’s Early Access or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/diablo-iv-open-beta-begins-on-march-24th-185933773.html">Open Beta</a> periods, your progress won’t carry over to Server Slam — nor will progress from the Server Slam transfer to the game’s launch.</p><p>Blizzard is giving Server Slam participants a challenging boss fight in Ashava, described as “one of the Burning Hells’ most fowl machinations.” The monster with “two razor-sharp arm blades, scales stronger than plate mail, and hell-bent on ripping through all who interrupt her quest to bathe Sanctuary in poisonous bile” should present a formidable challenge for Level 20 and under players. However, anyone taking her down will seize the Cry of Ashava Mount Trophy, which will roll over to the final launch. Additionally, you’ll get another chance to earn the trophies from the first two beta weekends, including the Initial Casualty Title (reach Kyovashad with one character), the Early Voyager Title and Beta Wolf Pack Cosmetic Item (both requiring reaching Level 20 on one character).</p><p>Blizzard is opening pre-downloads for Server Slam two days before the event, on May 10th at 12 PM PDT. You can read the full installation instructions <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/23938755/help-us-gear-up-for-launch-during-the-diablo-iv-server-slam">here</a>, and if you participated in the earlier betas (and didn’t uninstall it), you’ll see an update for Server Slam available to download.</p><p>Engadget’s Igor Bonifacic tried <em>Diablo IV</em> during a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blizzard-diablo-4-preview-this-feels-worryingly-good-160026475.html">December preview</a> and the more <a href="https://www.engadget.com/diablo-iv-beta-preview-more-polished-and-even-more-satisfying-133038708.html">recent betas</a> and was left cautiously optimistic. It revealed impressive attention to story and gameplay detail as the upcoming title slows its pace while still adhering to the franchise’s familiar roots. However, we’ll have to wait and see if Blizzard can “stick the landing,” given the publisher’s hit-or-miss record in recent years — and memories of the fiasco that was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-05-17-blizzard-weighs-in-on-diablo-3-launch-issues.html"><em>Diablo III</em>’s 2012 launch</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/blizzard-will-let-you-try-diablo-iv-once-more-ahead-of-its-june-launch-211509415.html?src=rss

## Twitter starts pulling legacy blue verification checkmarks

<p>Twitter has talked about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-says-its-killing-legacy-verified-checkmarks-starting-on-april-1st-035927238.html">pulling legacy verified checkmarks</a> for a while, and now it's acting on that plan. The social network has begun removing the original blue ticks from users' profiles — formerly verified staff at Engadget can confirm this. From now on, you'll need to pay $8 per month for Blue to get that symbol back. Businesses can receive a gold checkmark without a subscription, while government and multilateral organization accounts get a gray checkmark.</p><p>The company introduced verification in 2009 to reduce the potential for impersonation, and focused on well-established (though not necessarily famous) people in areas like politics, entertainment and the media. When Elon Musk bought Twitter in 2022, however, he <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1590757322149998592">claimed</a> there were too many &quot;corrupt&quot; verified accounts and that it was necessary to drop the legacy system. He characterized Blue as a way to democratize checkmarks.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That's not how it panned out. Twitter had to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-blue-monday-11-per-month-ios-221436172.html">pause and relaunch</a> Blue after trolls <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-blue-verification-impersonation-disaster-203656712.html">abused the feature</a> to impersonate notable figures, including Musk. The firm instituted a review process and barred sign-ups from accounts that had been around for less than 90 days. Gold and gray checkmarks restored some of those anti-impersonation measures, but many celebrities, journalists and similar personalities no longer have those protections.</p><p>Twitter has had other problems with user labels, too. Multiple major media organizations, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/npr-is-ditching-twitter-over-government-funded-media-label-on-its-main-account-155556726.html">including NPR</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pbs-has-also-quit-twitter-over-its-government-funded-media-label-164843803.html">PBS</a>, have left Twitter over objections to the social site's &quot;government-funded media&quot; designation. These outlets say the label falsely implies government influence over their content when they maintain strict editorial independence. The death of legacy checkmarks just underscores this conflict — critics are concerned that Twitter is eroding trust in its quest to earn more revenue from subscriptions.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/twitter-starts-pulling-legacy-blue-verification-checkmarks-205010576.html?src=rss

<p>These days, there are better options to ensure WiFi signals reach every part of your home than struggling to fix a router to your ceiling. A mesh network uses multiple nodes (or points), giving you several connectivity points instead of just a single router. Google's Nest WiFi system is a solid mesh network option, and the devices are currently on sale on Amazon. A two-pack of the Nest WiFi system has <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDg0RDVQREpULz90aD0xJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXR5LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyZWUyZTVjYi1hNTlkLTQzNGEtYWUyNi05N2UzNGVkZTgwMmMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAeL0k0k0XT91747gfb-y5uv3PCFf3kod6Zz-IQNFVFnb&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB084D5PDJT%2F%3Fth%3D1">dropped to $100,</a> which is the lowest price we've seen to date.

A two-pack will provide WiFi coverage over up to 3,800 square feet, while the three pack will cover as much as 5,400 square feet, Google says.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Each Nest router and point can connect to as many as 100 devices simultaneously. Each router has two Ethernet ports, while each point is a smart speaker with Google Assistant integration.

## CATL’s new battery tech could inch electric planes closer to reality

<p>With the world gradually moving toward electric cars, it’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/we-wont-have-electric-airplanes-until-battery-tech-improves-160058357.html">only a matter of time</a> before EVs take to the skies, at least for shorter trips. Inching us closer to that milestone is Chinese battery maker CATL (Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited), which on Wednesday <a href="https://www.catl.com/en/news/6015.html">launched</a> a battery at the Shanghai Auto Show that it claims can power electric passenger aircraft. The semi-solid state battery with condensed electrolyte has a density of up to 500 Wh/k, meaning it can store 500 Watt hours of energy for every kilogram of its weight.</p><p>The company says it can “achieve mass production of [the] condensed battery in a short period of time,” and it expects to begin mass production of an automotive-focused variant later this year. “The launch of this cutting-edge technology breaks the limits that have long restricted the development of the battery sector and will open up a new scenario of electrification centering on high level of safety and light weight,” stated CATL’s announcement. However, NASA has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-04-nasa-first-all-electric-x-plane.html">testing electric planes</a> throughout the past decade, and others are working on hybrid planes, like ZeroAvia’s hydrogen-electric aircraft that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/zeroavia-flight-largest-aircraft-hydrogen-electric-engine-201422671.html">completed a 10-minute flight</a> this January. Rolls-Royce even flew an all-electric plane at 387 MPH in a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rolls-royces-all-electric-airplane-hits-a-record-3874-mph-top-speed-082803118.html">recent test</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>CATL says it’s working with unnamed partners to develop flying EVs. “At present, CATL is cooperating with partners in the development of electric passenger aircrafts and practicing aviation-level standards and testing in accordance with aviation-grade safety and quality requirements,” the battery maker stated.</p><p>Additionally, CATL <a href="https://www.catl.com/en/news/6014.html">says</a> it’s working to improve the carbon footprint of its batteries and plans to achieve carbon neutrality for its manufacturing plants by 2025 and across the battery value chain by 2035. It plans to focus on mining, bulk raw materials, battery materials, cell manufacturing and battery systems to achieve the goal. “As electrification extends from the land to the sky, aircrafts will become cleaner and smarter,” the company stated. “The launch of condensed batteries will usher in an era of universal electrification of sea, land and air transportation, open up more possibilities of the development of the industry, and promote the achieving of the global carbon neutrality goals at an earlier date.”</p><p>However, it’s worth tempering our expectations about flying EVs. Some movement in that direction could help reduce greenhouse-gas emissions from the aviation industry, which <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/06/09/1053337/aviation-industry-emissions-alternative-fuels/">accounts for</a> about three percent of global emissions. But it would require more significant advances than CATL’s new battery for them to become a viable alternative to today’s jet-fuel-powered aircraft. So although we may see some commercial electric planes take to the skies within the next decade, don’t expect batteries to power much beyond small and short-distance planes anytime soon.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/catls-new-battery-tech-could-inch-electric-planes-closer-to-reality-200531533.html?src=rss

## Spider-Man movies finally arrive on Disney+

<p>It took a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-disney-licensing-014946942.html">couple of years</a>, but Disney+ is finally doing more to patch the Spider-Man-sized hole in its Marvel movie lineup. The streaming service is <a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/movies/spider-man-movies-disney-plus">adding</a> the first wave of Spidey movies to its US catalog in the next few weeks. Sam Raimi's trilogy and <em>The Amazing Spider-Man</em> will be available tomorrow (April 21st), while <em>Homecoming</em> and <em>Venom</em> arrive May 12th.</p><p>More of Sony Pictures' Spider-Man movie and TV lineup will come to the US later in the year, Disney says. While you can already watch <em>The Amazing Spider-Man 2</em> in at least some countries, this does mean you'll have to wait if you want to watch titles like <em>No Way Home</em> or <em>Into the Spider-Verse</em> without turning to other services (and in some cases, paying for a purchase or rental).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The gap has long been a pain for Disney, and particularly since the launch of Disney+ in 2019. Sony has a perpetual film license for Spider-Man so long as it releases a new title every 5.75 years. Disney had to reach a deal to borrow the web-slinger for Avengers movies as Sony still had the rights to the character's solitary adventures. You had to turn to Disney+ rivals like Netflix (which has exclusive rights for Sony movies) to see the rest of Spider-Man's story.</p><p>Disney addressed that omission in 2021, when it struck a deal to access Sony's theatrical releases through 2026 as well as archival Marvel titles like the Spider-Man series. You're now seeing the fruits of that agreement — Disney+ doesn't have to worry as much about viewers subscribing to competitors just to get their full superhero fix.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/spider-man-movies-finally-arrive-on-disney-194520655.html?src=rss

## The EARN IT Act will be introduced to Congress for the third time

<p>The controversial EARN IT Act, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-05-earn-it-act-section-230.html">first introduced in 2020</a>, is returning to Congress after failing twice to land on the president’s desk. The Eliminating Abusive and Rampant Neglect of Interactive Technologies Act, (EARN IT) Act is intended to minimize the proliferation of Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) throughout the web, but detractors say it goes too far and risks further eroding online privacy protections.</p><p>Here's how it would work, according to the language of the bill's reintroduction last year. Upon passing, EARN IT would create a national commission composed of politically-appointed law enforcement specialists. This body would be tasked with making a list of best practices to ostensibly curb the digital distribution of CSAM. If online service providers do not abide by these best practices, they would potentially lose blanket immunity under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, opening them up to all kinds of legal hurdles — including civil lawsuits and criminal charges.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Detractors say EARN IT places a whole lot of power to regulate the internet in the hands of the commission the bill would create as well as state legislatures. Additionally, language in last year's bill suggests that these guidelines would likely extend to encrypted information, so if an encrypted transmission runs afoul of any guidelines, the platform is on the hook. This will force providers to monitor encrypted communications, which goes against the whole point of encryption in the first place. Additionally, end-to-end encryption is designed so that not even the platform can read the contents. In other words, providers might not be able to offer those protections.&nbsp;</p><p>“This was a dangerous bill two years ago, and because it’s doubled down on its anti-encryption stance, it’s even more dangerous now,” The Center for Internet and Society at Stanford Law School <a href="https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2022/02/earn-it-act-back-and-it%E2%80%99s-more-dangerous-ever">wrote in a blog post</a> last year, a stance also <a href="https://cdt.org/press/earn-it-act-threatens-privacy-protections-free-expression/">mirrored</a> by the Center for Democracy and Technology. The American Civil Liberties Union, pushing back on a <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/free-speech/the-earn-it-act-is-a-disaster-for-online-speech-and-privacy-especially-for-the-lgbtq-and-sex-worker-communities">prior version of the bill</a>, said that it &quot;threatens our online speech and privacy rights in ways that will disproportionately harm LGBTQ people, sex workers and others who use the internet to privately communicate and share information and resources.&quot;</p><p>The Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network (RAINN) has come out in defense of the bill, saying that it will “incentivize technology companies to proactively search for and remove” CSAM materials. “Tech companies have the technology to detect, remove, and stop the distribution of child sexual abuse material. However, there is no incentive to do so because they are subject to no consequences for their inaction,” wrote Erin Earp, RAINN’s interim vice president for public policy.</p><p>The bipartisan Senate bills have consistently been introduced by Republican Senator Lindsay Graham and Democrat Senator Richard Blumenthal, and their companion bills in the House likewise have been sponsored by Republican Representative Ann Wagner and Democrat Representative Sylvia Garcia. The full text of <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/2732?s=1&amp;r=1">H.R.2732</a> is not publicly available yet, so it's unclear if anything has changed since last year's attempt, though when reintroduced last year <a href="https://www.engadget.com/earn-it-act-2022-explained-153058123.html">it was more of the same</a>. (We've reached out to the offices of Reps. Wagner and Garcia for a copy of the bill's text.) A member of Senator Graham's office confirmed to Engadget that the companion bill will be introduced within the next week. It also remains to be seen if and when this will come up for a vote. Both prior versions of EARN IT died in committee before ever coming to a vote.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-earn-it-act-will-be-introduced-to-congress-for-the-third-time-192619083.html?src=rss

The EV will have three colorways and cost $15,499, which is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/harley-davidson-livewire-del-mar-announced-specs-availability-202520836.html">$499 more than the previous target price</a>. However, the S2 Del Mar remains LiveWire's most affordable model — the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/harley-davidson-livewire-one-pricing-availability-172610253.html">LiveWire One</a> starts at $22,799.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/harley-davidson-livewire-electric-motorcycle-brand-182501586.html">LiveWire</a> will announce the final specifications in June, though it has offered a taste of what to expect. The brand says the Del Mar, which weighs 431 pounds, will have a 110-mile city range on a single charge. Plugging in a Level 2 charger should take the battery from a 20 percent charge level to 80 percent in 75 minutes, LiveWire claims (there's no fast charging capability, unfortunately). It's expected that the Del Mar's powertrain will deliver 184 pound-feet of torque and be capable of accelerating from zero to 60MPH in 3.1 seconds.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Along with US pricing and availability, LiveWire revealed the initial S2 Del Mar details for Europe. Reservations for the S2 Del Mar European Launch Edition open on April 27th and require a €100 down payment, but only 100 of the EVs will be available at the outset. Those who snag a S2 Del Mar Launch Edition will get an exclusive, hand-painted finish and wheel design.</p><p>European deliveries of the Launch Edition are slated for September. It costs €20,190 in France, €19,990 in Germany, €20,390 in the Netherlands and £18,990 in the UK. Details of the European production model will be revealed later.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/harley-davidsons-livewire-s2-del-mar-electric-motorcycle-costs-14999-174545955.html?src=rss

## VW and Rivian once again qualify for federal EV tax credits

<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/starting-tomorrow-only-six-evs-will-still-qualify-for-a-7500-federal-tax-credit-185304414.html">narrow list of EVs</a> that qualify for federal tax credits has already grown again. <em>Ars Technica</em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/04/more-evs-are-eligible-for-clean-vehicle-tax-credits-up-to-7500/">notes</a> the US government has restored multiple electric rides to <a href="https://fueleconomy.gov/feg/tax2023.shtml">the list</a> of vehicles that get at least some credit. The 2023 VW ID.4 (the first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vw-2023-id4-pricing-release-date-165237007.html">US-made model</a>) receives the full $7,500 incentive, as do the upcoming Chevy <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-2024-chevrolet-blazer-ev-ss-rs-023052241.html">Blazer EV</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chevy-blazer-equinox-ev-teaser-184112130.html">Equinox EV</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chevrolet-silverado-ev-details-ces-debut-171551300.html">Silverado EV</a>. Rivian <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-r1t-electric-truck-review-150019762.html">R1T</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-r1s-suv-ev-review-video-160029394.html">R1S</a> buyers can also get a $3,750 credit provided their configuration slips under the $80,000 cap.</p><p>When the Internal Revenue Service outlined the original list, just six EVs could get the full tax credit. This included the Cadillac Lyriq, Chevy Bolt, Chevy Bolt EUV, Ford F-150 Lightning, Tesla Model 3 and Tesla Model Y. Other EVs and plug-in hybrids only received partial credits, such as the Chrysler <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chrysler-pacifica-hybrid-2018-phev-recall-irl-131527040.html">Pacifica PHEV</a> and Ford Mustang Mach-E.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Treasury Department outlined <a href="https://www.engadget.com/stricter-guidance-means-fewer-evs-will-qualify-for-7500-federal-tax-credit-180350889.html">stricter requirements</a> for EV tax credits in March. To be eligible for $3,750, a car's battery components must be 50 percent made or assembled in North America. At least 40 percent of key minerals must come from the US or its free trade partners to earn another $3,750. Batteries must be completely made in North America by 2029 for vehicles to still qualify.</p><p>As VW is keen to <a href="https://media.vw.com/en-us/releases/1740">point out</a>, this makes the ID.4 a better deal. The entry-level Standard trim costs $31,495 after accounting for the tax credit. If you can live with the 209-mile range, it may seem like a bargain compared to even the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/teslas-latest-price-cut-brings-model-3-pricing-below-40000-071124983.html">price-cut Model 3</a>. You'll more likely want to spring for the ID.4 Pro with 275 miles of range, but that's still more attainable with a $36,495 sticker after the incentive.</p><p>This may also help put Chevy's wave of upcoming EVs within reach. The Equinox in particular is expected to start around $30,000 — a full credit would price it below many conventional SUVs, let alone electrified versions. As with VW, the discount could spur sales and help the US meet the climate goals that helped prompt the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/president-joe-biden-signs-inflation-reduction-act-200724230.html">Inflation Reduction Act</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/vw-and-rivian-once-again-qualify-for-federal-ev-tax-credits-170656685.html?src=rss

## Michael Schumacher’s family plans to sue German tabloid for AI-generated ‘interview’

<p>This week, a German tabloid tested the boundaries of AI passing itself off as reality. Celebrity magazine <em>Die Aktuelle</em> published a cover story in its April 15th issue about a supposed interview with Formula One driver Michael Schumacher; only at the end does it reveal that it was a hoax produced entirely by an AI chatbot. Schumacher’s family <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8b9dfafd-e7b1-4ac1-bb73-50d55c74d82d&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=ESPN&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4YjlkZmFmZC1lN2IxLTRhYzEtYmI3My01MGQ1NWM3NGQ4MmQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXNwbi5jb20vZjEvc3RvcnkvXy9pZC8zNjIzNTM2Ni9taWNoYWVsLXNjaHVtYWNoZXItZmFtaWx5LXRha2UtbGVnYWwtYWN0aW9uLWZha2UtYWktaW50ZXJ2aWV3IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhODRiOTkwZS0zMTlmLTQ1NzctYTYyMi04MDk3YTYxNmU4ZDAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZkKWIjhZsWaiao5RnyrwsgGWiGFOqiIlycyWYMwEfKh&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.espn.com%2Ff1%2Fstory%2F_%2Fid%2F36235366%2Fmichael-schumacher-family-take-legal-action-fake-ai-interview">told</a><em>ESPN</em> it plans to take legal action against the gossip rag.</p><p>The article promised “the first interview” with Schumacher, who suffered a severe brain injury on a family ski trip in the French Alps in 2013. Since then, the celebrated driver — arguably the greatest in Formula One history — hasn’t appeared publicly as his family guards his privacy.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The public’s best description of Schumacher’s life today came from the 2021 Netflix documentary <em>Schumacher</em>, in which his wife Corinna Schumacher said, “Michael is here. Different, but he’s here, and that gives us strength, I find.” She continued, “We live together at home. We do therapy. We do everything we can to make Michael better and to make sure he’s comfortable, and to simply make him feel our family, our bond.” Concluding, she stated, “We’re trying to carry on as a family, the way Michael liked it and still does. And we are getting on with our lives. ‘Private is private,’ as he always said.”</p><p>This week’s issue of <em>Die Aktuelle</em>, showcasing a photo of a smiling Schumacher, promised “No meagre, nebulous half-sentences from friends. But answers from him! By Michael Schumacher, 54!” according to <em>ESPN</em>. A subheading on the magazine cover reads, “Es Klingt täuschend echt,” which translates to “It sounds deceptively real.”</p><figure><img alt="Cover of the April 15th, 2023 issue of German tabloid ‘Die Aktuelle’ featuring Michael Schumacher’s face.

As generative AI rapidly advances, separating fact from fiction — whether through chatbot-generated text, fake photos or (very soon) convincing bogus videos — will become increasingly difficult.</p><p>Without clear legal and regulatory boundaries, the world’s fascists, propagandists and other nefarious actors will exploit generative AI mercilessly for money and power. For example, what happens if fake <a href="https://www.engadget.com/midjourney-ends-free-trials-of-its-ai-image-generator-due-to-extraordinary-abuse-153853905.html">images</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/deepfake-detectors-can-be-duped-083601148.html">deep-fake videos</a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ai-voice-tool-deepfake-celebrity-audio-clips-094648743.html">audio recordings</a> about political candidates go viral as voters head to the polls in the pivotal 2024 US election? Without any meaningful consequences for abuse, we find ourselves in a new AI Wild West. And although the Biden administration appears to be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-administration-wants-your-input-on-rules-for-ai-models-like-chatgpt-193527890.html">taking some initial steps</a> in exploring safeguards against this type of behavior, I’m skeptical that America’s senior government leadership will skate to where the puck will be, rather than falling hopelessly behind this quickly evolving <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chatgpt-is-suddenly-everywhere-are-we-ready-180031821.html">new form of misinformation and disinformation</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/michael-schumachers-family-plans-to-sue-german-tabloid-for-ai-generated-interview-165220254.html?src=rss

<p>While we at Engadget are blessed with a passion for cooking, most of us are not blessed with spacious kitchens. But that doesn’t stop us – we use every inch of our tiny apartment kitchens as efficiently as possible. In doing so, we’ve found that some of the most useful cooking tools are the small things – items hiding deep in your drawers or sitting humbly on your countertop that you turn to often and may end up taking for granted. We wanted to highlight some of our favorite small kitchen essentials to remind everyone (including ourselves) that you don’t need to add the latest ultra-convenient unitaster to your kitchen to make great food. Ultimately, it’s the small stuff that matters, both when it comes to recipe ingredients and the tools you keep in your cupboards.</p><h2>Thermapen One</h2><p></p><p>If there was ever an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/best-kitchen-tech/">essential kitchen gadget</a>, an instant-read thermometer is certainly it. Not only does it help you cook things correctly, but aso safely. No one wants to serve their guests undercooked chicken. If you’re in the market, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8ec42127-5c25-4160-a755-9edb36e27b1b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=ThermoWorks&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4ZWM0MjEyNy01YzI1LTQxNjAtYTc1NS05ZWRiMzZlMjdiMWIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlcm1vd29ya3MuY29tL3RoZXJtYXBlbi1vbmUvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjN2Q2Yzk3Zi1hZTA1LTQ0NTItYmQ4ZC01Mzc5ODE2YTk0NzEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAeOHY3A0ncOPd1V_LBTNd3MNbOX9Nr5NnSLsr5RQTlr4&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thermoworks.com%2Fthermapen-one%2F">Thermapen’s One</a> is the best your money can buy. It’s more expensive than your run-of-the-mill probe, but the One gets its name from its speed: it can provide readings in one second.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>What’s more, the One is accurate to within half a degree and the IP67 waterproof housing means it will hold up to any accidents. The display auto rotates so you’re never twisting your neck to read the numbers. It’s also equipped with a motion sensor so that display automatically comes on when you pick up the thermometer. The Thermapen One will serve you well in the kitchen, at the grill and for many other things, making it a go-to for a variety of culinary tasks. <em>– Billy Steele, Senior News Editor</em></p><h2>Microplane</h2><p></p><p>I bought my <a href="https://amzn.to/3wQAmEV">Microplane</a> after taking an in-store cooking class at Sur La Table where, admittedly, the hosts had an agenda to sell us stuff on our way out. I treated myself to this $15 hand grater, having just been introduced to it in my cooking demo. Today, I use it for everything from mincing garlic, to zesting citrus to grating parmesan over my pasta. The Microplane takes up less cabinet space than <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9NaWNyb3BsYW5lLTQwMDIwLUNsYXNzaWMtWmVzdGVyLUdyYXRlci9kcC9CMDAwMDRTN1Y4P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXR1LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjN2Q2Yzk3Zi1hZTA1LTQ0NTItYmQ4ZC01Mzc5ODE2YTk0NzEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWD-Ro5El-LYZ2V7kyntBm2KYQbZm5EBDr4Ll81rwjOY&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMicroplane-40020-Classic-Zester-Grater%2Fdp%2FB00004S7V8%3F">my box grater</a> – and it’s never sliced my finger like traditional models either. The only annoying thing about my workflow is that the Microplane is often sitting dirty in the dishwasher when I need it. But at this price, with such a small footprint, it wouldn’t kill me to get a spare. <em>– Dana Wollman, Editor In Chief</em></p><h2>Instant Pot</h2><p></p><p>I was late to hop on the Instant Pot train. I picked up the three-quart Instant Pot Ultra on Prime Day in 2020, and even as I waited for it to arrive, I was slightly skeptical about how much I’d really use it. Fast-forward more than a year and the multi-cooker has become one of the most used gadgets in my laughably small kitchen. If I had enough counter space, it would stay out all the time – next to my other cooking MVP, my <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9WaXRhbWl4LUJsZW5kZXItUHJvZmVzc2lvbmFsLUdyYWRlLUNvbnRhaW5lci1CbGFjay9kcC9CMDA4SDRTTFY2P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXR1LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjN2Q2Yzk3Zi1hZTA1LTQ0NTItYmQ4ZC01Mzc5ODE2YTk0NzEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZbUaDiOCS2oV32dwbGjkfO7RU0md-GG8rdc_2-7C_5a&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FVitamix-Blender-Professional-Grade-Container-Black%2Fdp%2FB008H4SLV6">Vitamix</a> – but sadly it has to sit in a lower cabinet when not in use. But I pull it out often to make <a href="https://rainbowplantlife.com/category/recipes/instant-pot-recipes/">soups and stews</a>, to meal-prep large batches of dried beans and even to whip up rice.

Baking bread, or just about anything else, requires precisely-measured ingredients, and a kitchen scale is far and away the easiest and most reliable way to measure out your ingredients.</p><p>I like this one because it’s compact, but can handle up to 11 pounds of weight. And it’s easy to quickly switch between pounds, grams and fluid ounces. And even though my pandemic baking hobby was short lived, I’ve found having a scale handy is actually quite useful. From brewing the perfect cup of pour-over, to weighing out the cat’s food, to managing my own portion sizes, this little scale has earned a permanent place on my counter. <em>– Karissa Bell, Senior Reporter</em></p><h2>Cosori gooseneck electric kettle</h2><p></p><p>There are very few items that have earned a permanent spot on my painfully tiny countertop, and my <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9DT1NPUkktRWxlY3RyaWMtR29vc2VuZWNrLVZhcmlhYmxlLVN0YWlubGVzcy9kcC9CMDdUMUNIMkhIP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXR1LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjN2Q2Yzk3Zi1hZTA1LTQ0NTItYmQ4ZC01Mzc5ODE2YTk0NzEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAV78soBBUo8FpWVHaswO0AuCqHgZ1nyxi9MeUXi80VCw&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCOSORI-Electric-Gooseneck-Variable-Stainless%2Fdp%2FB07T1CH2HH">Cosori electric kettle</a> is one of them. I’ve <a href="https://www.engadget.com/favorite-gadgets-2020-irl-170055096.html">written about it before</a>, about how I finally decided to move on from the dark ages of heating up water for tea in the microwave to something more civilized. But the kettle has proven itself useful in many other ways, like prepping stock by using Better Than Bouillon and boiling water, and making the occasional quick cup of ramen. I like that Cosori’s model has different built-in temperature settings for different types of drinks, and its gooseneck design makes it easy to use for Chemex-made coffee. I’ve thought about upgrading to a new kettle recently, but I always ask myself, why? Cosori’s is still going strong, just the same as the day I bought it. <em>— V.P.</em></p><h2>Cuisinart DLC-2ABC mini food processor</h2><p></p><p>According to my Amazon records, I purchased this small-batch <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwMDAwNjQ1WU0_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tdHUtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImM3ZDZjOTdmLWFlMDUtNDQ1Mi1iZDhkLTUzNzk4MTZhOTQ3MSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQdDK-rbMhznjufCMVScUV5ghEpw7Fx95VB3oI4NJy3f&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0000645YM%3F">Cuisinart food processor</a> for about $28 on Amazon Prime Day 2017, correctly surmising that I didn’t need anything larger or pricier. For small kitchens and occasional use, the size is right – and so is the price, even if you pay closer to the $40 MSRP. And don’t be fooled by the name “mini” either – the three-cup capacity is enough to whip up pesto, hummus and various other dips and sauces. The only time recently I had to work in batches was when I was grinding up Oreos for the cookie layer of an ice-box cake. No big deal, and certainly not a dealbreaker.</p><p>When it comes to cleanup, I like that the plastic cup and lid can go in the dishwasher, though I need to wash the blades and wipe down the base by hand. Fortunately, too, it’s short enough in stature that it can sit even in a cabinet with just 9.5 inches of clearance. And, because it’s so lightweight, pulling it down from above my head never feels like a safety risk. <em>– D.W.</em></p><h2>Magnetic Measuring Spoons</h2><p></p><p>I’ve accumulated lots of measuring spoons over the years – plastic, metal, some with a key ring attached – but these are the only ones I bother to use anymore. <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwMDFHQVFLS1c_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tdHUtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImM3ZDZjOTdmLWFlMDUtNDQ1Mi1iZDhkLTUzNzk4MTZhOTQ3MSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAbDresY5HtJY-Eirxu_DrqsESxwhnJfkap2Q73skJD-8&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB001GAQKKW">This set</a>, which includes five spoons ranging in size from a quarter-teaspoon to tablespoon, has a magnetic nesting design, ensuring the spoons take up as little space as possible. (I also never find myself ransacking the drawer to find the one missing spoon that I really need at that moment.) Equally important: Each spoon is two-sided, so if I need to use the tablespoon, say, for both wet and dry ingredients, I can keep the two separate and throw just the one spoon in the dishwasher when I’m done. <em>– D.W.</em></p><h2>A magazine rack</h2><p></p><p>Look, don't ask me exactly which one is hanging off the pegboard I installed in my kitchen — I don't remember and frankly, you're buying bent pieces of wire, so any distinction between different brands is likely trivial. The point is that, while I have the utmost respect for printed media, the best use for a magazine rack is for storing pot lids, a very necessary and otherwise extremely annoying-to-store kitchen object.</p><p>What kind you look for depends mostly on what sorts of pot lids you're trying to stash away.

This is also the best bet if you — like me, and probably most people — have a set of pots and pans cobbled together from a variety of manufacturers and your lid handles are a mix of both varieties.</p><p>The only word of caution I'll offer is that, while pot lids might not be as heavy as, say, a cast iron skillet, <em>install your magazine rack securely</em>, either off a pegboard (which I cannot recommend highly enough for its versatility) or make sure it's screwed down into a wall stud.

In small kitchens, you need all the counterspace you can get, and Chemex’s three or six-cup carafe takes up a lot less space than the typical drip machine. It’s also easier to clean and stash away in a cupboard when not in use (and easier on the eyes if you do leave it out).</p><p>Most importantly, it brews a far better cup than any machine. To the uninitiated, pour-over setups can seem intimidating, but a Chemex makes it reasonably foolproof: add grounds to a filter (you can use bonded paper filters or get a reusable one), add hot, but not-quite-boiling, water, wait a few minutes and you’ll have a surprisingly smooth cup of coffee. What’s great about a Chemex is you can put as little or as much effort in as you want. Like other pour-over setups, there’s room for endless experimentation: you can change up the grind size, water temperature and coffee to water ratio to get the “perfect” cup. Or, if you’re less fussy, you can do what I do most mornings and eyeball it — as long as you don’t pour your water too quickly even a hastily made Chemex cup will have a lot more flavor than whatever is coming out of your drip machine. <em>– K.B.</em></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/small-kitchen-essential-gadgets-irl-154530643.html?src=rss

<p>You now have a fresh alternative to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rodecaster-pro-ii-details-000035416.html">Rode's mixing desks</a>, particularly if you're a budding music streamer. Boss has <a href="https://www.boss.info/global/promos/gigcaster/">introduced</a> Gigcaster 5 and Gigcaster 8 USB mixers built with livestreaming performances in mind. The touchscreen and physical controls are built to handle common streaming tasks, such as fading a source or playing effects (like delays and voice transformation), using only hardware. They support hands-free control through pedals and similar devices, too. Multiple inputs help you connect instruments and XLR mics, and Bluetooth is available if you're performing through a phone or tablet.</p><p>You aren't forced to go live. While the Gigcasters were designed for services like Facebook Live, Twitch and YouTube, you can also use them for podcasting, pre-recorded videos and similar offline content. This is primarily intended to streamline setups that would otherwise require multiple boxes to achieve the same results.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="aa6b78da30bb48c7894f880516905a68"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>The Gigcaster 5 is the 'entry' model with a direct guitar input, two XLR ports, stereo line in, eight virtual pads and a 16x12 USB interface. Move to the Gigcaster 8 and you get the guitar input as well as four XLR/TRS combo inputs, an onboard stereo mic, eight physical effect pads, a 20x14 USB interface and multitrack recording to microSD cards.</p><p>Both mixers ship to the US in May. The Gigcaster 5 costs $479, while the Gigcaster 8 is priced at $699. These aren't casual purchases if you're just starting out, and they don't include a video capture card like Rode's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rodes-streamer-x-combines-an-audio-interface-with-an-external-capture-card-221321424.html">Streamer X</a>. Boss' hardware offers much more advanced audio control than that device, however, and the outlay may be justified if it adds polish to your livestreamed concerts or DJ sets.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/boss-gigcaster-mixers-are-designed-for-live-music-streaming-145553970.html?src=rss

<p>Multipurpose cooking devices that can more or less do it all can be incredibly handy to have in the kitchen. A single product that can pressure cook, air fry, bake, slow cook and even sous vide can save you lots of money and counter real estate.

<p>While some of us will invariably make the local news with our stoney hijinks this Thursday, countless more will celebrate the High Holiest of Herbal Holidaze the right way: quietly, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-20-the-gear-you-need-420.html">responsibly</a>, baked out of our gourds watching Shaw Brothers movies while housing hoagies. Here’s the gear you need to avoid having your mugshot run alongside a graphic reading, “Marijanhuh?” but still thoroughly enjoy this year’s 4/20.</p><div id="b4f53e0cceb243bf802e0b36db8c86e4"></div><h2>Herbalize It</h2><p>While <a href="https://www.headset.io/posts/exploring-category-shifts-in-the-california-cannabis-market">the popularity of flower has waned in recent years</a> in favor of more easily-handled edibles and pre-rolled smokables, loose leaf bud remains a cornerstone of the modern cannabis market. If you want to go the traditionalist route, pick up a <a href="https://santacruzshredder.com/collections/three-piece">Santa Cruz Shredder 3-piece grinder</a> and some rolling papers. The Santa Cruz is spacious enough to hold multiple J’s worth of shredded flower, have deeply textured grips to ease strain on your wrists and feature a curved collection bowl that can be cleared with just your fingertip, rather than a straightened paper clip and cursing. Even if you prefer dry herb vaping, that grinder will invariably come in handy as the weed you pack into the chamber will need to be shredded if you want it to heat up evenly and not scorch.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In terms of tabletop dry herb vapes, you really can’t go wrong with the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=06bf8102-610f-4390-8d92-8b50065dbc19&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Storz%26Bickel&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIwNmJmODEwMi02MTBmLTQzOTAtOGQ5Mi04YjUwMDY1ZGJjMTkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3RvcnotYmlja2VsLmNvbS9lbi11cy92b2xjYW5vaHlicmlkIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI5ODBjYWY4Ni1jMjY4LTRiOGMtODY2MS0xOGQ5MGQxNzYzYjAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWGpRoFWkaq0-90lSdgoNFqGMMWo43NPoRXYqnHVjjU2&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.storz-bickel.com%2Fen-us%2Fvolcanohybrid">Storz and Bickel Volcano</a>. They’re definitely on the pricey side, with the newest Hybrid model running $700, but Storz and Bickel’s reputation is well earned and a Volcano is the sort of vape that you don’t get rid of so much as pass down to your kids. Heck, the one I bought in 2010 is still going strong even after multiple bag and whip replacements. The most recent versions offer a slew of enticing features including the ability to heat a bowl to its vaporization point in under two minutes — a significant upgrade from the days counting to 100 and back as the bag inflated — as well as iOS and Android apps.</p><p>For handheld or portable dry herb vapes, you’ve got a lot more options, both in terms of choices between makes and models and desired feature sets. Basically though, you’re looking for something easy to charge (preferably USB-C) with a robust battery life, something that’s easy to load, use and clean.</p><p>The $209 <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=06bf8102-610f-4390-8d92-8b50065dbc19&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Storz%26Bickel&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIwNmJmODEwMi02MTBmLTQzOTAtOGQ5Mi04YjUwMDY1ZGJjMTkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3RvcnotYmlja2VsLmNvbS9lbi11cy9jYXRhbG9nL3Byb2R1Y3Qvdmlldy9pZC82MTMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijk4MGNhZjg2LWMyNjgtNGI4Yy04NjYxLTE4ZDkwZDE3NjNiMCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQuLMHyOU44izNaZ2dNotRiTAQoPhlZCz3n0vE3O2H_v&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.storz-bickel.com%2Fen-us%2Fcatalog%2Fproduct%2Fview%2Fid%2F613">Storz and Bickel Crafty+</a> takes everything we love about the Volcano — the quality of construction and its ease of use, for example — and shrinks it down into a form factor that fits in your skinny jeans. With a generously proportioned heating chamber, rapid USB-C charging, an associated Android app and one button heating controls, the Crafty+ is a solid vaporizer choice for serious stoners.</p><p>The <a href="https://bndlstech.com/product/tera/">Tera from Boundless</a> is a $250 alternative to the Crafty+ that uses convection air flow to help ensure even heating. It also uses standard 3.7V 18650 Li-ion batteries so picking up spare and replacement parts in the future won’t be a hassle. With a temperature range of 140 - 500 degrees F, the Tera can handle both dry herb and concentrates. You can even swap out the mouthpiece to use the device as a blower for your water pipe to further filter the vapor before inhaling it.</p><p>A more refined vaping experience can be had, at a price, with <a href="https://tinymightvape.com/index.php?route=product/category&amp;path=59">the TinyMight 2</a>. Ranging from 349€ for the basic package to 449€ (~ $380 - $490) for all accessories included, the TM2 is highly customizable with options for everything from the length of the draw tube to the length of the power cable. It’s constructed from stainless steel and aluminum with a solid oak wrapping that not only makes it look nice  but acts as a thermal insulator. The TinyMight2 charges via USB-C and, like the Tera, uses 18650 batteries. The TM2 takes 2-5 seconds to fully heat up and can be used either in on-demand or session mode — meaning the device will either heat up only when you draw or it’ll heat up and stay hot for a set amount of time (aka a “session”).</p><p>For those of you not looking to spend multiple hundreds of dollars on what essentially amounts to a very fancy hot plate, I suggest the XMAX V3 Pro. It’s always around $90, depending on what vape site you visit and what sales are happening that day (<a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=0a128ab3-51c7-4ac7-b39e-50ad8e7abf4c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Planet+of+the+Vapes&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIwYTEyOGFiMy01MWM3LTRhYzctYjM5ZS01MGFkOGU3YWJmNGMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGxhbmV0b2Z0aGV2YXBlcy5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMveG1heC12My1wcm8tdmFwb3JpemVyIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI5ODBjYWY4Ni1jMjY4LTRiOGMtODY2MS0xOGQ5MGQxNzYzYjAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAASvet3zWAyxSEdKfoS9B_yBcO6myIXE3bKDSuFC6kLUQ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.planetofthevapes.com%2Fproducts%2Fxmax-v3-pro-vaporizer">Planet of the Vapes</a> and <a href="https://www.vapospy.com/p/xmax-v3-pro">Vapospy</a> are both generally trustworthy resources). Rather than a block, it’s wand-shaped! Like the Tera, the V3 Pro uses both convection airflows for heating, and can handle both dry herb and concentrate. It uses 18650 batteries and USB-C charging for power. However, the V3 is significantly slower in heating the chamber (around 15-25 seconds) than its alternative but, again, is less than half the price. It’s an expensive 10 seconds.</p><p>Speaking of hot plates, <a href="https://tafee.com/discover.html">the Bowle from Taffee</a> combines two of the five best things you can do with your mouth: drinking and vaping! This unique gadget combines a puck shaped vaporizer for heating loose leaf buds with a 250 or 400mL cup seated on top. With it, you can take rips and sips alternately or simultaneously to meld the flavors and experiences. A one-hour charge is enough to power eight sessions with the convection heater needing just one second at a time to fully heat. They even sell a specialty grinder (for $70, yikes) that will load the ground flower into individual ceramic heating cups.</p><h2>Vaporize It</h2><p>Flower is abundant, relatively ubiquitous even, but sometimes you want a little extra punch in your pipe, or maybe you just want to get high without smelling like it. For those instances, we invented concentrates. Whereas flower tops out at around 35 percent THC content, concentrates range anywhere from the mid seventies up to 98 percent THC, so a little goes a long way. As such, the devices vaporizing them are going to be smaller, lightweight, and longer lasting than their dry herb kiln kin but you’re still going to want to look for many of the same amenities — 510 threading, a common charging port style, generous battery capacity, and a straightforward user interface.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.yocanvaporizer.com/products/yocan-uni-pro-2-0">Uni Pro 2.0 from Yocan</a> ticks all those boxes. Full disclosure, this model is my everyday vape and I am rather partial to it. At $50, the Uni Pro 2.0 runs about double than the generic stick batteries you buy at the dispensary, but you get a lot of features for that added expense. Its 650 mAh battery is recharged via USB-C and sufficient to power through a full gram oil cartridge without needing to recharge. The power output runs 1.8 - 4.2V and can be controlled in .1V increments, which the OLED screen displays, along with the battery life, ohm rate and draw duration.</p><p>I’m not a huge fan of the magnetic screw-on cartridge adapters that Uni Pro 2 relies on, mostly because I have a habit of absentmindedly throwing them out with the exhausted cart and replacements are $7 a pop. It’s available in a variety of colors (when they’re not sold out) and can accommodate a wide range of cartridge sizes — whether tall and narrow or short and squat. Best of all, the Uni Pro 2 is small enough, heavy enough and blocky enough to not immediately get lost in my pants pocket amidst my keys and loose change.</p><p>If you’re looking for something similarly shaped but a bit less blocky and a bit more stylish, you can’t go wrong with the $59 <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy52ZXNzZWxicmFuZC5jb20vcGFnZXMvY29tcGFzcy1zZXJpZXMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijk4MGNhZjg2LWMyNjgtNGI4Yy04NjYxLTE4ZDkwZDE3NjNiMCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAbrMJzC6ZkWSxHa4JTA538iqGc6fT9GPX4qBI-YbsZvk&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vesselbrand.com%2Fpages%2Fcompass-series">Compass from Vessel</a>. It’s about the same size as an AirPods case and comes in six accent colors. It’s got a 550mAh battery and charges via USB-C. The commands to lock/unlock the device, change the temperature settings or activate the heater unit are all controlled through a single pushbutton on the front of it. It’s discrete, even when there’s a cartridge mouthpiece sticking up like a Nokia antenna, and easily palmable — the kind of classy vape you bring along on a night out on the town.</p><p>Vessel also makes a pair of stick vapes, the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy52ZXNzZWxicmFuZC5jb20vY29sbGVjdGlvbnMvY29yZS1zZXJpZXMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijk4MGNhZjg2LWMyNjgtNGI4Yy04NjYxLTE4ZDkwZDE3NjNiMCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAUimMCRJ-gZxbfI6RjiVCTeHKni18TiKMNX2_9MeF9wT&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vesselbrand.com%2Fcollections%2Fcore-series">Core</a> and the ”ruggedized” <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy52ZXNzZWxicmFuZC5jb20vY29sbGVjdGlvbnMvZXhwZWRpdGlvbi1zZXJpZXMvcHJvZHVjdHMvZXhwZWRpdGlvbi10cmFpbC1lZGl0aW9uIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI5ODBjYWY4Ni1jMjY4LTRiOGMtODY2MS0xOGQ5MGQxNzYzYjAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARfSJ4OumCmrkhEsW2NoM2BmMVCGni9QwcqOJZ3Dl5jG&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vesselbrand.com%2Fcollections%2Fexpedition-series%2Fproducts%2Fexpedition-trail-edition">Expedition Trail Edition</a>.

So in an attempt to figure out who the Blade 18 is really for, I asked Razer to send over a base model of the laptop, which goes for a <em>slightly</em> more affordable price of $2,900 to see how much you're really getting for all that money.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Design and display</h2><div id="e7ad77a0d59845a087e148921facba23"></div><p>If you can look past its price, there's very little dislike about the Blade 18's design. Razer's aluminum body is super sturdy, with almost no flex on its lid and deck. Its keyboard also feels great and comes with per-key RGB lighting, though some may be a bit dismayed that Razer couldn't find room for a numpad even on a laptop this big. And thanks to support for tons of ports including an HDMI 2.1 jack, Ethernet, a full-size SD card reader and multiple USB Type-A and Type-C connectors, you'll never have to worry about carrying a dongle or dock around — which is a good thing because at 6.8 pounds the Blade 18 is heavy enough on its own.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>While it's not <em>that </em>much larger than the Blade 17, Razer’s biggest laptop ever definitely doesn’t fit in my normal messenger bag, and it damn near bursts the seams on my everyday backpack too. So if I want to carry it around (not that I really want to), I have to break out my big travel backpack, which is probably for the best because its padded straps are kind of a must if you plan on carrying around the Blade 18 and its 1.7-pound power brick for any length of time. That said, for a desktop replacement, actually using the Blade 18 on your lap isn't as awkward as you might imagine. Despite its size, the notebook is balanced well and it tends to keep thermals in check during regular use, though if you're gaming you're still going to want to find a table or desk.&nbsp;</p><p></p><figure><img alt="The Blade 18 has a pretty standard keyboard layout along with per-key RGB backlighting. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/4bd3d6f0-df77-11ed-be5d-ae6ce5cbf8df" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>My one gripe with the Blade 18 is the lack of additional display options. On the old Blade 17, Razer provided a choice between a 240Hz QHD panel or a 144Hz UHD screen, the latter of which would be great for content creators who want a mobile workstation for editing 4K videos. Plus, when you factor in that an SD card reader comes standard, transitioning from shooting footage to editing is as simple as yanking a card out of your camera and slamming it in the Blade. And unlike the Blade 15, there’s no option for an OLED panel either. Now it’s quite possible that Razer is saving some of these upgrades for a forthcoming Studio version of the Blade 18 designed expressly for content creators, but that’s not much of a consolation to people looking for a new machine today.</p><h2>Performance</h2><p>A base Blade 19 definitely isn't a slouch with an Intel Core i9-13950HX chip and an RTX 4060 GPU. But once again, it's really the value proposition I'm questioning. That's because if you do want a laptop with big performance but in a slightly smaller package, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-rog-zephyrus-m16-2023-review-big-performance-with-a-brilliant-display-134540091.html">ASUS’ Zephryous M16</a> can be configured with an i9 CPU and an RTX 4090 for $1,000 less than the Blade 18, while the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5e0bed65-d2f8-4b34-9b8f-955218c0e37a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Best+Buy&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI1ZTBiZWQ2NS1kMmY4LTRiMzQtOWI4Zi05NTUyMThjMGUzN2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmVzdGJ1eS5jb20vc2l0ZS9hc3VzLXJvZy16ZXBoeXJ1cy0xNi0yNDBoei1nYW1pbmctbGFwdG9wLXFoZC1pbnRlbC0xM3RoLWdlbi1jb3JlLWk5LXdpdGgtMTZnYi1tZW1vcnktbnZpZGlhLWdlZm9yY2UtcnR4LTQwNzAtMXRiLXNzZC1vZmYtYmxhY2svNjUzNTUwMS5wP3NrdUlkPTY1MzU1MDEiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImUzYWM0OTlmLTczNWEtNDhiMi05YmMzLTUwZjFhMDgwM2IwZSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAUfP4JwvUS06okeMPGCk3TFSKGNBxgyM6gl_ZB8laPQE&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fasus-rog-zephyrus-16-240hz-gaming-laptop-qhd-intel-13th-gen-core-i9-with-16gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-1tb-ssd-off-black%2F6535501.p%3FskuId%3D6535501">base version of the M16</a> features an RTX 4070 GPU starting at just $1,950.</p><figure><img alt="The Blade 18 comes with a fantastic set of ports including a full-size SD card reader and an HDMI 2.1 connector.

And when I tweaked the game’s settings to try to get the best out of that 240Hz display, the Razer only managed 122 fps with high textures and NVIDIA’s DLSS set to Ultra Performance mode. That said, even with the base model, there isn't really any title the Blade 18 can't handle, so you can easily take your games on the road.</p><h2>Battery Life</h2><p>Speaking of traveling, while it would be nice to be able to just grab the laptop and go, leaving the Blade 18’s power adapter at home is basically never an option. On PCMark 10’s Modern Office battery test, it lasted just two hours and 57 minutes, which is a full hour and a half less than ASUS’ ROG Zephyrus M16. And while it shouldn’t be a big surprise, if you’re playing games without being plugged into the wall, you can expect runtimes of two hours or less.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><figure><img alt="The Blade 18 even comes with an Ethernet jack and multiple USB Type-A and Type-C ports so you don't really need to carry a dongle or dock around. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/b25ee860-df77-11ed-9b5f-0a254b4c6fda" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>Ok, so back to my original question: Who is this thing really for? If you’re coming from a smaller system, moving to the Blade 18 is almost like that episode of <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=89f68c82-f255-44fa-8db9-03fec996b93a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YouTube&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4OWY2OGM4Mi1mMjU1LTQ0ZmEtOGRiOS0wM2ZlYzk5NmI5M2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1qNl9wdl92UkhLSSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZTNhYzQ5OWYtNzM1YS00OGIyLTliYzMtNTBmMWEwODAzYjBlIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAc4zw1NrAmO7WLnhA7WGwGw-90byZTgj1PvXK4T3vQE6&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dj6_pv_vRHKI"><em>Seinfeld</em> where Jerry nearly blunders his way into a menage a trois</a> before backing out. Living with a laptop this big isn’t merely upgrading your machine. You have to change the way you travel, you need to buy more expensive peripherals that won’t look shabby next to your fancy laptop, and you’ll probably want to get some rich friends who don’t mind sending a driver to pick you up when you want to have a LAN session. It’s not just a more powerful way to game, it’s a whole new lifestyle choice.</p><p>Alternatively, if you like playing games and making videos, the Blade 18 certainly has the size and the performance to do both well, though its screen isn’t ideal for content creation. Honestly, the main use case for the Blade 18 is if you’re on the road a lot or if you’re someone like a game developer and you want a portable workstation that you can lug around to show off your upcoming title. Back in the day, that honor often went to systems like MSI’s huge 17-inch Dragon and Dominator laptops, which were even thicker and heavier, regularly weighing in at over 10 pounds. But as part of a new breed of desktop replacements, the Blade 18 offers support for the fastest laptop components out right now, but in a relatively less bulky, though still big chassis.</p><figure><img alt="Razer's signature unibody aluminum design is still one of the nicest chassis on any gaming laptop today. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/e3e150d0-df77-11ed-b6df-016f3b51db38" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget</div></figure><p>That said, the reality is that for most people, the Blade 18 doesn’t make a ton of sense. There are a number of other desktop replacements that aren’t quite as fancy for hundreds (or even thousands) less. And if you still want a machine with serious performance that’s easier to carry around, there are rivals like the Zephyrus M16 too. Ok, so what’s left? Luxury and prestige, because if you have a sky-high budget and want a super premium gaming laptop, there isn't much that can top a fully loaded Blade 18. But for everyone else thinking about getting in on the ground level with a base model, your money would go a lot further elsewhere.</p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/razer-blade-18-review-specs-price-overpowered-and-oversized-133044127.html?src=rss

## SpaceX's Starship completed its first fully integrated launch before exploding

<p>SpaceX has finally completed its first fully integrated Starship flight test after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-will-attempt-starship-orbital-test-in-march-says-elon-musk-195410384.html">months of delays</a> and a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/watch-spacexs-starship-orbital-test-flight-at-920am-et-124553427.html">scrubbed launch</a> earlier in the week, albeit not as smoothly as it would have like. The combination of Starship and a Super Heavy booster lifted off from SpaceX's Boca Chica, Texas facility at 9:34AM Eastern after a brief hold, but failed to separate and tumbled down in a botched flip maneuver before exploding.</p><p>CEO Elon Musk previously told enthusiasts to temper their expectations. The Starship flight was meant to collect data for future boosted trips. As SpaceX explained during its livestream, clearing the launchpad was the only objective — anything beyond that was just a bonus. The company scrubbed the first attempt due to a frozen pressurant valve.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="ad342739ad2c45c6a76bfd6a3f3d9fad"></div><p>SpaceX hasn't yet said when it expects to conduct its next flight attempt. The outfit says it can produce more than one Starship at a time, so the delay won't necessarily be lengthy.</p><p>Starship and Super Heavy together are 394 feet tall, or taller than the Saturn V rocket. The 39 total Raptor engines (33 in the booster, six in Starship) are powerful enough to haul payloads up to 330,000lbs to low Earth orbit when fully reusable, and 550,000lbs when expendable. For context, even Falcon Heavy can bring 'just' 141,000lbs to that orbit. The new rocketry allows missions that simply weren't possible before, including eventual trips to the Moon and Mars that require extensive fuel and supplies.</p><p>Success with the next test is vital given the timing for both SpaceX's own plans and NASA's exploration efforts. SpaceX is counting on Starship for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-dennis-tito-moon-space-tourist-161528381.html">lunar tourism</a> and other commercial flights. NASA's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-picks-spacex-artemis-4-102537076.html">Artemis Moon landings</a>, currently slated to start in December 2025, will depend on the rocket for reaching the surface and returning astronauts to the Orion capsule for the trip home. The sooner SpaceX can prove Starship is viable, the better its chances of minimizing further delays.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/spacexs-starship-completes-its-first-fully-integrated-flight-test-but-fails-to-reach-orbit-134226956.html?src=rss

## Acer's latest Chromebook Spin 714 sports a 2K webcam

<p>Acer reliably makes some of the best Chromebooks on the market, and today it's announcing an update to the Chromebook Spin 714 as part of a slew of PC news. Like last year's model, the Chromebook Spin 714  is a premium laptop that's thin (0.7 inches), light (about three pounds) and powerful.&nbsp;</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the new model users Intel's 13th-generation Core processors — either the i3-1315U, i5-1335U or i7-1355U. Acer also offers a high-end model geared at enterprise use with Intel's vPro platform with an i7-1365U processor. Combine that with up to 32GB of RAM and up to a 1TB SSD and you're looking at far more power than most ChromeOS tasks need, but that's kind of the point when you're looking at a premium Chromebook.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Another notable change is the webcam — Acer put a &quot;QHD 2K&quot; camera in the Spin 714. It feels like companies are finally adjusting to the realities of work-from-home life and giving us webcams that offer notable improvements, so I'm glad to see that here.&nbsp;</p><p>Otherwise, the Spin 714 sticks to the usual premium Chomebook script that we know from Acer, not that that's a bad thing. As usual, Acer is using a durable anodized aluminum chassis which the company says meets the US MIL-STD 810 durability spec. As the name suggests, the 14-inch 1,920 x 1,200 touchscreen has a 360-degree hinge so you can prop the laptop up in tent mode or use it as a tablet. I say this every year: this trick means nothing to me.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="Acer Chromebook Spin 714" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/b876fa90-df7b-11ed-bded-41015ed02e9b" style="height: 1000px; width: 1800px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Acer</div></figure><p>But Acer and plenty of other companies are still keen on convertible laptops, so I'm sure someone out there appreciates it. The touchscreen does work well with a USI stylus, offering 4,096 levels of pressure and tilt sensitivity — so if you're interested in drawing on the relatively large canvas this screen afford you, it should work pretty well. There's nothing new about the keyboard or trackpad this year, though Acer once again thoughtfully includes an optional fingerprint sensor for security. And past keyboards and trackpads on the high-end Spin models have been very good.</p><p>Finally, Acer says the battery on this laptop will last for about 10 hours. Unfortunately, most high-end Chromebooks I've used lately seem to max out in the six-to-seven hour range. Not terrible, but not ideal for a relatively expensive device. Hopefully the new Spin 714 will get closer to matching its promised battery life than last year's model.&nbsp;</p><p>The Chromebook Spin 714 starts at $699 and will be available in North America in May. It'll then come to Europe, Middle East and African markets in July. As usual, Acer says it'll offer a wide variety of configurations, with prices differing by spec and region.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/acers-latest-chromebook-spin-714-sports-a-2k-webcam-133056810.html?src=rss

## Acer's Swift X 16 now comes with AMD's 7040-series processors

<p>It’s been possible for a while to snap up a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/acer-swift-x-geforce-rtx-30-series-thin-and-light-134500570.html">14-inch version</a> of Acer’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/acer-swift-x-16-intel-arc-graphics-181536080.html">Swift X</a> flagship laptop that’s toting <a href="https://www.engadget.com/acer-swift-edge-lightweight-laptop-131538302.html">AMD’s silicon</a> instead of Intel’s. But either I’m getting more forgetful, or this might be the first time that AMD’s hardware is coming to the 16-inch version of the Swift X. Today, Acer has announced that its biggest ultrabook is getting AMD’s new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amds-ryzen-7000-mobile-cpus-16-core-033046361.html">7040-series</a> processors. Those can be paired with either one of NVIDIA’s 30 or 40-series RTX GPUs, with the machine aimed at creative professionals who need something a little more muscular when they’re on the go.</p><p>We might as well discuss those new internals first, since would-be buyers get a whole raft of build-to-order options. There’s the new Ryzens, running from the Ryzen 5 7535HS all the way to the Ryzen 9 7940H, paired with 16GB RAM and either a 512GB, 1TB or 2TB SSD. That will sit beside your pick of NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3050 with GB RAM, or an RTX 4050 with 6GB RAM.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Given the focus on creative and power users, there are two options for displays, a 16-inch 2,560 x 1,600 (WQXGA), 165Hz IPS LCD display with a peak brightness of 500 nits. Those in the market for something easier on the eye can instead opt for a 16-inch 3,200 x 2,000 (WQXGA+) 120Hz OLED with support for 100 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut.</p><p>Acer also wants to talk about the redesigned aluminum chassis, which it says offers better thermal performance, a lighter weight and a “more confident look and feel.” That extends to the harder, straighter lines on the side on the deck and a taller top lid that, when open, stretches down to the table. The redesigned internals have made room for a bigger, 76Wh battery, offering a battery life of anything up to 10 hours on a charge.</p><p>Rounding out the spec list is two USB-A, two USB-C ports, one of which can be used to charge the machine, a HDMI 2.1 port, a 3.5mm headphone jack and a microSD card reader.</p><p>As for how much it’ll set you back, the Acer Swift X 16 will land in North America in July, with the base model priced at $1,250. But, as with all of these machines, you can expect that figure to climb once you start adding in some of those fancier build-to-order perks.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/acers-swift-x-16-now-comes-with-amds-7040-series-processors-133042413.html?src=rss

## Acer brings 13th-generation Intel chips to more of its gaming laptops
 - [https://www.engadget.com/acer-brings-13th-generation-intel-chips-to-more-of-its-gaming-laptops-133025970.html?src=rss](https://www.engadget.com/acer-brings-13th-generation-intel-chips-to-more-of-its-gaming-laptops-133025970.html?src=rss)

<p>At the start of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intels-13th-gen-laptop-cpu-24-cores-140050825.html">new chip generation</a>, manufacturers are forced to start the slow yet vital process of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/acer-nitro-predator-helios-ces-2023-intel-nvidia-update-170030815.html">updating their existing hardware</a>. Today, it’s Acer’s turn to show off a quartet of gaming units that, in the near future, will be permitted to run Intel and NVIDIA’s latest silicon. For instance, the range-topping Predator Triton 17 X, with its austere, Razor Book-esque design, is only available with NVIDIA's RTX 4090 GPU and Intel’s Core i9-13900HX. You can pair those with up to 64GB RAM and anything up to 4TB of SSD storage, and if you’ve still got cash left over after all <em>that</em>, you can also snap up a version with a 250Hz mini-LED display with 1,000 nits peak brightness. Those antsy to get their hands on it will only need to wait until next month for it to arrive, with the base model priced at $3,799.</p><figure><img alt="Image of the Acer Predator Helios Neo 16 on a table." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/246b80f0-df7b-11ed-bf5f-c2f73d70d9e9" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>The Predator Helios Neo 16, meanwhile, can be specced with either a Core i5-13500HX or a Core i7-13700HX. You get three options on the GPU side, an RTX 4050 with 6GB RAM, or the pick of a 4060 or 4070, both of which come with 8GB of dedicated RAM. Further down the options list, you can choose up to 32GB RAM, up to 2TB of SSD storage and either a 1,920 x 1,200 or 2,560 x 1,600 IPS display with a 165Hz refresh rate. There's a new chassis design on display here, and Acer says that its new heat pipe design will pull away between six and nine percent more heat than its immediate predecessor. That machine will land on these shores in May, with the base model price setting you back $1,199.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Image of Acer Predator Triton 14, a 14-inch refined gaming notebook, on a table." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/ffec6500-df7a-11ed-8bcd-6f9a193a2597" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>Those wanting a similarly outrageous amount of power in a smaller body, meanwhile, can turn to the Triton 14. That model is able to take up to a Core i7-13700H and the pick of an RTX 4050 with 6GB RAM or a 4070 with 8GB RAM. Much like the Neo 16, RAM tops out at 32GB, but you will get the option for a 2,560 x 1,600, 250Hz mini-LED display with a peak brightness of 600 nits. I'll be honest, I've always had a soft spot for the throwback charms of some of Acer's demure gaming laptops, and the Triton 14 has that in spades. Unfortunately, limited I/O and slightly less-than-you-might-expect-for-this-money material quality means I'm less enthused about this machine after seeing it up close and personal. You can already guess that this is debuting in the US in May, but you need to have at least $1,499 in your pocket before you can think about buying one.</p><p>And finally there’s the Predator Helios 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition which you get no prizes for guessing comes with Acer’s glasses-free 3D display. This model can be ordered with Intel’s Core i9-13900HX, an RTX 4080 GPU and 32GB RAM when it makes its US bow in June for a minimum spend of $3,499. It’s worth saying any potential buyers of this model are well advised to check out my colleague Devindra Hardawar’s review of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/acer-predator-helios-300-spatiallabs-edition-review-173058399.html">Helios 300 SpatialLabs edition</a>. He said the glasses-free display isn’t good enough to compensate for the headaches, or the compromised visual quality you get compared to other, better, gaming machines.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/acer-brings-13th-generation-intel-chips-to-more-of-its-gaming-laptops-133025970.html?src=rss

<p>As much as we all love our gadgets, they all <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-08-24-the-cost-of-e-waste-and-what-you-can-do-about-it.html">contribute to a growing e-waste</a> problem. Knowing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/where-to-recycle-electronics.html">where to recycle your used electronics</a> can help mitigate that — but if you want to take it a step further, you could seek out more sustainable products like Acer's Vero line of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/acer-chromebook-vero-514-010058870.html">&quot;eco-friendly&quot; laptops</a>. Not only is the latest model of Acer's Aspire Vero 15 more powerful, but the company says it's built with more sustainable materials than ever, too.</p><p>Boiled down to the specs, the new Acer Aspire Vero 15 is a pretty standard spec upgrade — outfitting the notebook with an 13th generation Intel Core processor available in i3, i5 and i7 configurations, up to 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM and as much as 1TB of storage. The latest revision also has an upgraded 1440p QHD webcam with AI noise reduction and voice enhancement features, two thunderbolt 4 USB Type-C ports, as well as two typical USB connectors, HDMI out and an audio jack.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The product line's eco-friendly credentials stem from a chassis built partially from post-consumer recycled plastics all cardboard packaging — and Acer says it's upgraded that aspect of the machine too. The new Aspire 15 Vero is now built from 40 percent PCR plastics (up from 30). The company also says the production process used 30% less CO2 than previous models. The laptop's circuit board is smaller too.</p><p>If that sounds like the machine for you, it won't be long before you can get your hands on it. The Acer Aspire Vero 15 launches in June, starting at $699.99.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/acers-new-aspire-vero-15-has-a-better-webcam-and-faster-processor-133006799.html?src=rss

## Imgur to ban explicit images and delete uploads not tied to an account

<p>For years, Imgur has made sharing photos and GIFs on the internet as easy as uploading a file — you don't even need an account to use it. Now the website has <a href="https://help.imgur.com/hc/en-us/articles/14415587638029">announced</a> a change to its <a href="https://imgurinc.com/tos">Terms of Service</a> that could potentially erase years of internet history. Starting on May 15th, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-29-imgur-wonderful-world-of-gifs-now-includes-video.html">Imgur</a> will be deleting &quot;old, unused, and inactive content&quot; that's not tied to a user account, so plenty of images posted on random websites online could disappear overnight. In addition, the service will be removing &quot;nudity, pornography and sexually explicit content&quot; even if they were uploaded by someone with an account.&nbsp;</p><p>Imgur has long been the go-to service for people uploading explicit content meant for sharing on NSFW subreddits, since Reddit itself prohibits direct uploads of explicit images. Back in 2019, the photo-sharing website <a href="https://blog.imgur.com/2019/10/14/discontinuing-support-for-nsfw-reddit-subsections/">stopped displaying</a> NSFW Imgur subsections associated with subreddits. However, it didn't delete any images and still allowed users to upload pornographic content, as long as they choose the &quot;hidden&quot; privacy status. Apparently, this has caused confusion and frustration on what is and isn't allowed on the hosting service. By banning explicit images completely, Imgur said it could address the risks they pose to its business and protect the company's future.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The website will use automated detection alongside human moderators to find content to be deleted under the new rules. It will not be issuing warnings or suspensions for automated flags, but it will warn users if they try to upload anything that violates its updated Terms of Service. &quot;Artistic nudity&quot; is still allowed under the new rules, but they might get flagged by the website's automated detection tool that's still being calibrated. Bottom line is that, those who want to save viral images and other pieces of internet history may want to download them before they disappear. And those using Imgur to post photos on /r/gonewild may want to find an alternative service soon.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/imgur-to-ban-explicit-images-and-delete-uploads-not-tied-to-an-account-122537118.html?src=rss

## HP's new Envy laptops include the first IMAX Enhanced PC

<p>HP is once again revamping its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hp-spectre-and-envy-hands-on-fresh-designs-and-updated-specs-price-release-date-120010992.html">Envy laptop line</a>, but this time it's more about who the company is working with than the raw specs. The headliner, the Envy x360 15.6-inch convertible, is billed as the first IMAX Enhanced-certified PC. Buy the version with an OLED screen (only 1080p, oddly enough) and you can watch <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-imax-enhanced-marvel-mcu-140052678.html">Disney+ movies</a> in the taller ratio with DTS:X spatial audio. There are also promises of exclusive remastered HDR content, although we wouldn't buy a computer just to revisit movies.</p><p>There are other reasons to consider HP's latest models, of course. Both the 15.6-inch and new 14-inch Envy x360 have improved screen-to-body ratios, the latest processors (13th-gen Intel Core for either, and AMD's Ryzen for the 15.6-inch) and upgraded webcams with manual privacy shutters and auto lock/wake features that secure your machine while you're away. The larger two-in-one also has the option of GeForce RTX 3050 graphics versus the RTX 2050 in the older model (sorry, no <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-40-laptop-gpu-price-release-date-165006688.html">RTX 4050</a> here) and wrings out up to 15 hours of battery life versus 10 for its predecessor. The two x360s top out at 16GB of RAM.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="HP Envy 17 (2023)" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/d94a6a80-def5-11ed-bff7-1e6ca86c8284" style="height: 1280px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">HP</div></figure><p>The lone conventional laptop update, the Envy 17.3-inch (pictured at middle), shares the camera, 13th-gen Core and available RTX 3050 graphics of the x360 15.6-inch. You only get an extra half-hour of battery life (nine total). but the 32GB RAM ceiling and optional 4K LCD should help if you're juggling heavy-duty apps.</p><p>The Envy x360 14-inch is shipping now with a starting price of $850. Its 15.6-inch counterpart arrives before the end of April with a $950 entry point. You'll have to wait until May to get Envy 17, which starts at $1,150. These aren't radical revisions, but the IMAX-certified laptop may be worth considering if you just have to watch the latest Marvel movies in the best-possible quality — so long as you don't need 4K, at least.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/hps-new-envy-laptops-include-the-first-imax-enhanced-pc-120042717.html?src=rss

## Oversight Board asks Meta to 'reassess' what COVID-19 misinformation it removes

<p>The Oversight Board has issued its response to Meta’s request to help it reevaluate its COVID-19 misinformation rules. The social network first asked the Oversight to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-oversight-board-covid-19-misinformation-advice-132031395.html">weigh in</a> on the rules last summer, noting that it policies had resulted in an “unprecedented” number of removed posts but that the pandemic had “evolved” considerably since the rules were first put in place.</p><p>In its policy advisory opinion, the Oversight Board said that Meta should continue to remove false claims about the pandemic that are “likely to directly contribute to the risk of imminent and significant physical harm,” but that it should "reassess" the specific claims that qualify for removal. The board also recommended that Meta make it easier for external researchers to study misinformation, and study how its own algorithms could contribute to the spread of harmful misinformation.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>When Meta <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2022/07/oversight-board-advise-covid-19-misinformation-measures/"><ins>first asked</ins></a> the Oversight Board about its COVID-19 misinformation rules, many speculated that the company was looking to soften its stance. Prior to the pandemic, the company rarely removed users' posts on the basis of misinformation. Instead, it relied on fact checkers to evaluate such questionable content, and information rated as false was down-ranked to make it less visible.</p><p>But at the start of the pandemic, Meta said it would remove misinformation that health experts said was likely to lead to harm. The result, as the Oversight Board notes, is that 27 million posts were removed from Facebook and Instagram between March 2020 and July 2022. The company currently lists <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2d66651e-658e-4baa-bc4e-ded0c126e805&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Portal+from+Facebook&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyZDY2NjUxZS02NThlLTRiYWEtYmM0ZS1kZWQwYzEyNmU4MDUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZmFjZWJvb2suY29tL2hlbHAvMjMwNzY0ODgxNDk0NjQxIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlMTIyZmRlNC03ODBjLTQ0OTEtOWIyYi1hYmI0NzMwNDUxNmIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAASUDFgLEn7fdvUbzG71vAA63kYFxrd-0EPv7r6Dj9U-M&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F230764881494641"><ins>80 specific</ins></a> claims that qualify for removal, including allegations that COVID vaccines cause magnetism and that the pandemic is linked to 5G technology.&nbsp;</p><p>In its advisory, the Oversight Board said that as long as the World health Organization designates COVID-19 as a global health emergency, Meta should continue to remove the most harmful misinformation. But it notes that the company has not consulted with public health officials or other experts to assess whether all the claims it removes continue to pose a serious threat.</p><p>“Should Meta find that any claims are no longer false or no longer ‘likely to directly contribute to the risk of imminent physical harm, such claims should no longer be subject to removal under this policy,” the Board writes. And while the Oversight Board didn’t attempt to weigh in on any of the specific claims, it did say that Meta should consult with a range of exerts, including those versed in virology, disinformation, human rights and “freedom of expression."</p><p>Notably, the Oversight Board is also, once again, pushing Meta to examine its own role in helping misinformation spread. The board recommended the company “commission a human rights impact assessment of how Meta’s newsfeed, recommendation algorithms, and other design features amplify harmful health misinformation and its impacts.” The Oversight Board made a similar recommendation in the wake of January 6th, saying that Meta should look at how its own decisions contributed to the insurrection, but the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-newsworthiness-politicians-oversight-board-171141109.html"><ins>declined</ins></a> to commit to new research.&nbsp;</p><p>The Oversight Board touched on another thorny topic for Meta: the ability of external researchers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-data-transparency-researchers-170021370.html"><ins>to study</ins></a> what happens on Facebook, which is particularly consequential for misinformation research. The board pointed to reports that Meta is getting ready to <a href="https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2022/meta-wont-comment-on-its-plans-to-abandon-crowdtangle/"><ins>disband CrowdTangle</ins></a>, the analytics tool used by researchers and journalists, and said that “research tools should be strengthened rather than discontinued."</p><p>“Meta should institute a pathway for external researchers to gain access to non-public data to independently study the effects of policy interventions related to the removal and reduced distribution of COVID-19 misinformation, while ensuring these pathways protect the right to privacy of Meta’s users and the human rights of people on and off the platform,” the board wrote.</p><p>As with all Oversight Board recommendations, Meta isn’t obligated to change any of its policies, but it is required to respond to each recommendation within 60 days.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/oversight-board-asks-meta-to-reassess-what-covid-19-misinformation-it-removes-120032687.html?src=rss

## The Morning After: How to claim your cut of Meta's $725 million class action settlement

<p>A federal judge recently gave initial approval to a $725 million settlement between Meta and Facebook users alleging the company shared their personal data without proper consent. If you used Facebook between May 2007 and December 2022 and lived in the US during that time, you’re <a href="https://www.engadget.com/heres-how-to-claim-your-cut-of-metas-725-million-cambridge-analytica-class-action-settlement-163255438.html">eligible</a> to get cash from the settlement.

<p>Google's advertising customers will soon be able to use the company's generative artificial intelligence to create ad campaigns, according to the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/36d09d32-8735-466a-97a6-868dfa34bdd5"><em>Financial Times</em></a>. Apparently, the tech giant is gearing up to embed its generative AI, the same technology powering its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-bard-ai-hands-on-a-work-in-progress-with-plenty-of-caveats-170956025.html">Bard chatbot</a>, into its Performance Max program. Performance Max can already help customers determine where their ads should run and generate simple ad copy. But the <em>Times</em>' says the AI's addition will give it the capability to create sophisticated campaigns similar to those designed by marketing agencies.&nbsp;</p><p>The company has reportedly shown ad customers a presentation entitled &quot;AI-powered ads 2023,&quot; telling them that its technology can generate advertisements based on the imagery, video and text they supply. In addition, Google told them that the ads its AI creates will fit the audience they aim to reach and will be designed to enable them to reach sales targets and other goals.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At least one person expressed concerns about the possibility of Google's ad tool spreading misinformation, the <em>Times</em> says, because it could be optimized to convert new customers with no concern for facts. Back when Google posted on ad on Twitter about Bard, for instance, the chatbot <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-bard-chatbot-false-information-twitter-ad-165533095.html">spouted a falsehood</a> claiming that the James Webb Space Telescope had taken &quot;the very first pictures of a planet outside of our own solar system.&quot; In truth, it was the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope that took the very first images of exoplanets that we had ever seen. Google has assured the <em>Financial Times</em> that it will put firm guardrails in place to prevent errors and misinformation when it rolls out AI-powered ads in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-reportedly-plans-to-let-companies-use-ai-generated-ad-content-105547069.html?src=rss

## Atari acquires the rights to over 100 PC and console classics

<p>Atari wants everyone to game like its 1985 — just with better technology. The console maker has announced the <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/04/19/2650476/0/en/Atari-Announces-Acquisition-of-More-than-100-PC-and-Console-Titles-from-the-80s-and-90s.html">acquisition of over 100 PC and console titles</a> launched in the 1980s and 1990s from Accolade, Micropose and Infogrames. Atari's ownership and catalogue have changed hands a bit since its heyday, so the purchase includes a homecoming for some of Atari's IPs. It's also adding Accolade's trademark to its vault.&nbsp;</p><p>The newly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/akka-arrh-remake-jeff-minter-atari-200603455.html">Atari-owned games</a> include the <em>Demolition Racer</em> series, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-11-13-bubsy-3d-tribute-is-this-weeks-best-weird-15-minutes.html"><em>Bubsy</em></a> and <em>Hardball</em>. “Many of these titles are a part of Atari history, and fans can look forward to seeing many of these games re-released in physical and digital formats, and in some cases, even ported to modern consoles,&quot; Wade Rosen, Atari's CEO, said in a statement.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Atari is really gunning for a comeback, with a &quot;multi-year effort to transform the company&quot; and investments in IPs people care about (<a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/04/17/atari-wade-rosen-interview">reimagined versions of <em>Asteroids</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-03-atari-missile-command-recharged.html"><em>Missile Command</em></a> are reportedly in the works). Just last month, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/atari-buys-the-game-studio-behind-the-system-shock-remake-165355144.html">Atari put through deals for Nightdive Studios</a> and <a href="https://atari.com/blogs/newsroom/atari-announces-acquisition-of-berzerk-and-frenzy-ip">the IPs of 12 Stern Electronics Arcade Classics</a>, including <em>Berzerk</em> and <em>Frenzy</em>. At the time, Rosen called the games a &quot;perfect fit for our strategy of commercializing classic retro IP.” The Nightdive Studios acquisition is notable not just for the games it provides, but for its technology. Nightdive specializes in remastering retro games for modern systems, while also improving their quality — exactly what Atari aims to do.&nbsp;</p><p>With its latest purchase, Atari says it will rerelease already existing games on modern consoles and create new adaptations of past storylines. The timeline here makes a lot of sense: Nightdive specializes in doing this, so it's going to make that a lot easier.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/atari-acquires-the-rights-to-over-100-pc-and-console-classics-103507660.html?src=rss

<p>Starting today, Uber Eats customers in Fairfax, Virginia can get their next meal delivered by a robot. In an expansion of the company’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-eats-autonomous-robot-deliveries-miami-cartken-151913191.html"><ins>existing partnership with Cartken</ins></a>, Uber has begun offering automated deliveries in the city’s <a href="https://mosaicdistrict.com/">Mosaic District</a>. With today’s announcement, a select number of the more than 40 restaurants in the area have begun transporting their food aboard Cartken’s six-wheeled robots. Among the restaurants participating in the pilot include Our Mom Eugenia, Pupatella and RASA.</p><p>Uber has been testing autonomous delivery robots in a handful of markets throughout the US. Last May, the company launched <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-eats-launching-two-autonomous-delivery-pilots-today-in-los-angeles-064252194.html/"><ins>two pilots</ins></a> in Los Angeles with the help of Motional and Serve Robotics. More recently, Uber signed a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-eats-nuro-autonomous-food-deliveries-texas-california-045758421.html/"><ins>10-year deal with Nuro</ins></a> to use the company’s vans for autonomous deliveries in California and Texas. Cartken, it should be noted, also works with Grubhub to deliver food on <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/grubhub-and-cartken-partner-to-bring-robot-delivery-to-college-campuses-301566245.html"><ins>college campuses</ins></a>. The firm’s robot uses <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-jetson-agx-orin-price-release-date-163327815.html/"><ins>NVIDIA’s Jetson tech</ins></a>, alongside cameras and sensors, to navigate streets and sidewalks.

## Tesla has scheduled a Cybertruck delivery event for the third quarter, Musk says

<p>When Tesla <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-cybertruck-2023-elon-musk-071706850.html">held its opening party</a> for the company's Giga Texas factory last year, Elon Musk said that it will finally start selling the Cybertruck in 2023. Now, we can narrow down the timing for its launch even further. According to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/19/23690346/elon-musk-tesla-cybertruck-delivery-event-q3-2023"><em>The Verge</em></a>, Musk just told Tesla investors during its most recent earnings call that the automaker will hold a delivery event for the Cybertruck in the third quarter of the year. Tesla will start manufacturing the vehicle this summer, but volume production <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-cybertruck-mass-production-164029626.html">won't begin until 2024</a> like the company had previously said.</p><p>Musk reportedly told investors during the call that it &quot;takes time to get the manufacturing line going, and this is really a very radical product.&quot; He added: &quot;It's not made in the way that other cars are made.&quot; The production version Cybertruck Tesla showed off on stage last year had no door handles and could automatically tell if its owner is nearby and it should open its doors. It's still made out of stainless steel like the automaker initially envisioned, though, and that's more expensive than steel typically used in the industry. As <em>The Verge</em> notes, the electric vehicle requires special welding techniques, and its smaller components are custom-made.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Cybertruck has been delayed several times since it was first announced back in 2019. Tesla's original and very optimistic initial launch date was 2021, but it was pushed back to 2022 and then to 2023. The vehicle's prices were originally supposed to start at $39,900 for a single-motor configuration to $70,000 for a three-motor one. Tesla warned earlier this year, however, that its final specs and pricing have yet to be determined and could be based on several factors, such as supply chain shortages and the economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/tesla-has-scheduled-a-cybertruck-delivery-event-for-the-third-quarter-musk-says-072539204.html?src=rss

## Jack Dorsey's Twitter-like Bluesky app arrives on Android

<p>Bluesky, Jack Dorsey's alternative to Twitter, is <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xyz.blueskyweb.app&amp;hl=en_US">now available</a> by <a href="https://bsky.app/">invitation only</a> on Android devices after arriving on the App Store in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jack-dorseys-twitter-alternative-bluesky-is-now-available-in-closed-beta-190600041.html">February</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/19/23690314/bluesky-decentralized-twitter-alternative-android"><em>The Verge</em></a> reported. The app has a number of Twitter-like functions, letting you search for and follow other users, create posts (with photos) and more. It's currently in beta, though, so has a limited number of users (reportedly around 25,000) and is missing features like direct messages.&nbsp;</p><p>Bluesky first came about in 2019 as a Twitter-backed side as a new type of decentralized standard for social media platforms. It officially broke off from Twitter in 2021, and has since joined the ranks of upstart Twitter clones like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/flipboard-is-leaning-into-mastodon-and-away-from-twitter-160036103.html">Mastodon</a> that appeared following Elon Musk’s takeover.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The app is designed to let users decide how they want to see and consume social media. &quot;For developers, an open marketplace of algorithms will provide the freedom to experiment with and publish algorithms that anyone can use,&quot; CEO Jay Graber <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jack-dorseys-bluesky-is-building-a-marketplace-of-algorithms-184601024.html">wrote last month</a>. &quot;For users, the ability to customize their feed will give them back control of their most valuable resource: their attention.&quot;</p><p>Graber has said that moderation is one of the last pieces of the puzzle to solve before the app opens to the public &quot;because we wanted to prioritize user safety from the start,&quot; he wrote in a <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/4-13-2023-moderation">recent blog post</a>. It'll apparently use a mixture of automated filtering and server-level moderation controlled by admins. Then, &quot;we will let users subscribe to additional sets of moderation labels that can filter out more content or accounts.&quot;&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/jack-dorseys-twitter-like-bluesky-app-arrives-on-android-063526715.html?src=rss

## Microsoft removes Twitter from its social media tool for advertisers

<p>Starting on April 25th, advertisers using Microsoft's social media management tool will no longer be able to access Twitter on their dashboard. As <a href="https://mashable.com/article/microsoft-drops-twitter-from-advertising-platform"><em>Mashable</em></a> has first reported, the tech giant has <a href="https://help.ads.microsoft.com/apex/index/3/en/60085">announced</a> on its Advertising platform page that its Digital Marketing Center's Smart Campaigns with Multi-platform tool will no longer support the social network in a few days' time. The announcement comes almost a month after Twitter revealed how much users will have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-announces-new-api-pricing-including-a-limited-free-tier-for-bots-005251253.html">to pay to access its API</a>. While the company wasn't that forthcoming when it came to pricing for enterprise customers, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-data-api-prices-out-nearly-everyone/"><em>Wired</em></a> previously reported that the cheapest package available for them cost $42,000 a month.&nbsp;</p><p>Although Microsoft could easily afford to pay that, it seems to have chosen to drop Twitter instead. Removing support for the website on its social media management tool means advertisers will no longer be able to use it to create, manage or schedule draft tweets, as well as to view past tweets and engagements. Microsoft has noted in its announcement that other social media channels, such as &quot;Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn will continue to be available.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>After Microsoft's announcement, Elon Musk responded to a tweet reporting its decision with a threat to take legal action against the company. &quot;They trained illegally using Twitter data. Lawsuit time,&quot; Twitter's owner wrote. He didn't elaborate on how Microsoft illegally trained anything using Twitter data, but it's worth noting that the tech giant is a key backer of ChatGPT developer OpenAI. The executive co-founded OpenAI back in 2015, but he distanced himself from the organization and has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-has-created-his-own-artificial-intelligence-company-012103279.html">vocally criticizing</a> the chatbot and AI as a whole as of late. Musk also recently revealed his plans for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-says-he-wants-to-start-truthgpt-to-rival-openai-and-google-014938539.html">his own AI company</a> that could rival OpenAI and Google.&nbsp;</p><div id="e24d61533ab3451cae206b11ee1f0865"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">They trained illegally using Twitter data. Lawsuit time.</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1648784955655192577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 19, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>Whether Musk's lawsuit threat would actually materialize remains to be seen. Regardless, Microsoft's decision came at a very bad time for Twitter. The website has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-losing-advertisers-boycott-193748977.html">steadily losing advertisers</a> since Musk took over, and according to digital marketing analysis firm Pathmatics by Sensor Tower, less than half of its top 1,000 advertisers <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/10/tech/twitter-top-advertiser-decline/index.html">spent money on ads</a> in January.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-removes-twitter-from-its-social-media-tool-for-advertisers-051717547.html?src=rss
