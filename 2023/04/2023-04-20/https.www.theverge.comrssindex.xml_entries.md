  <p id="XBXIYF"><em>Street Fighter 6</em> comes out in a little over a month, but if you want to get warmed up before the game’s full release, you can check out a new demo on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0102-PPSA07185_00-SF6DEMO000000000">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0102-CUSA33101_00-SF6DEMO000000000">PlayStation 4</a> right now. If you’re on Xbox Series X / S or PC, the demo will be available on April 26th.</p>
<p id="JrOAbI">As part of the demo, you’ll be able to try out part of the game’s World Tour single-player mode, and build a custom avatar for World Tour that can be transferred to the full game at launch. (Well, as long you end up playing the full game on the same platform.)</p>
<p id="SBT2Hb">Capcom revealed the demo as part of Thursday’s <em>Street Fighter 6</em> Showcase, which was chock-full of new details about the game. Here’s just a few:</p>

  <p id="jj7RTT">The family of Formula 1 racing legend Michael Schumacher is preparing to take legal action against <em>Die Aktuelle</em>, a German tabloid magazine, for publishing an AI-generated “interview” with the star. The publication ran a front cover spread earlier this week promising an exclusive with Schumacher, accompanied by a tag referring to the piece as “the first interview” since the F1 star suffered a serious brain injury during a skiing accident in December 2013.</p>
<p id="ekx9eS">“No meager, nebulous half-sentences from friends,” reads the translated text on the magazine cover. “But answers from him! By Michael Schumacher, 54!” A strapline calling the interview “deceptively real” is the only indication on the cover that the piece wasn’t authentic. <em>Die Aktuelle</em>,...</p>

  <p id="WQTaH4">SpaceX’s integrated Starship spacecraft successfully took off from its launchpad in Boca Chica, Texas, on Thursday but didn’t manage to fully complete its test flight. The spacecraft spun out of control before bursting into a ball of flames about four minutes into its flight, cutting the test short.</p>
<p id="sCfDQt">In <a href="https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/1649045802332073986?t=2VqWo3JLdu1om_pxGVIVoQ&amp;s=19">a statement on Twitter</a>, SpaceX said, “Starship experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly before stage separation.” During today’s 90-minute test flight, Starship was supposed to reach an altitude of about 150 miles during a journey around the globe before splashing down into the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii. SpaceX scrubbed its first test flight attempt on April 17th <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1647950862885728256?s=20">due to a “frozen” pressurant valve</a>.</p>

Set in an alternate version of Seattle, one where harpies, elves, vampires, and werewolves were as common as humans, it put players in the role of a barista at a late-night cafe. You had regulars who would chat about their problems, ask for their favorite drinks, and you mostly listened and offered advice. The sequel — dubbed <em>Episode 2: Hibiscus &amp; Butterfly</em> — doesn’t change much. And that’s exactly what makes it so endearing.</p>
