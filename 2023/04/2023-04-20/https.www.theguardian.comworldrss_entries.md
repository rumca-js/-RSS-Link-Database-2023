However, <strong>Taylor</strong> is this morning criticising the appointments for ignoring the recruitment process:</p><p>We were disappointed that the first two appointments that have been made by the Treasurer, <strong>he completely ignored the recruitment process, the merit-based rigorous process that is laid out in the review</strong>. We do think it is important that the government is going to say it supports the recommendations of the review<strong>, it walks the walk and doesn’t just talk the talk.</strong></p><p>Aren’t those appointments we speak of Ian Ross and Elana Reuben all aimed to bring greater diversity views to the Reserve Bank board. The board is dominated by RBA officials and the Treasury secretary and big business leaders?</p><p>We want intellectual diversity. The review laid that out plainly and I endorsed the need for that. There is a clear process, a rigorous merit-based process that is laid out in recommendation 14.2 of the report and the government hasn’t followed it with its first two appointments. We want the government to get serious about the recommendations that are laid out in this report.</p><p>No, I think [Chalmers] is jumping ahead of himself. We are working closely with the government. I worked closely with the review panel and we very much welcome the report.</p><p>We think there is some very good features of this. The sharp focus on the 2-3% inflation target. The clear focus on accountability and transparency of the Reserve Bank. We are very open focus on that monetary policy board and a merit based recruitment process for board members for that board and the pre-existing board, all these things we think are a step in the right direction.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/apr/21/australia-news-live-renewables-superpower-clean-energy-summit-jim-chalmers-nsw-liberals-leadership-indigenous-voice-cost-of-living-interest-rates-drug-reform">Continue reading...</a>
