It’s been 30 years since the last time we saw Mario on the big screen, and that… did not go so well. Finally, the multiple decades have seemingly allowed the Nintendo Corporation to cool off and give Mario and Luigi another shot at cashing in in Hollywood.
The Super Mario Bros. Movie definitely raises some questions. Like why was there a warp pipe under the streets of Brooklyn? Why did Princess Peach bring up her mysterious past and then not explain any further? What are these power-up boxes and how did they get there? Why didn’t Toad have to do that obstacle course, and why did Mario have to spend so much time doing it only to fail?
To answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to The Super Mario Bros. Movie!
