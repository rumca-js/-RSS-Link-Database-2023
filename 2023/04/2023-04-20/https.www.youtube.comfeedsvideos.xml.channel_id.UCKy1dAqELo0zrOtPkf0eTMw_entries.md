Roblox’ chief science officer Morgan McGuire has led the company’s research into AI since he joined in 2021. The underlying technology of Roblox has been steadily evolving since the day it was launched. The tools it provides range from simple graphical editors to a full-blown scripting language that allows creators to build virtually anything they can imagine. Powering all of that is a complex set of tools that now includes a growing number of AI-powered systems that make things simpler than ever to create and share ideas.

The following nuggets of AI-focused wisdom are taken from a much longer interview we recorded with McGuire during the 2023 Game Developers Conference.  Part of IGN AI Week. Read more right here!  https://www.ign.com/special/ai-week/?

Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp reviewed by Jada Griffin on Nintendo Switch.

With nicely redone graphics and excellent music bringing the classic turn-based tactical action up to modern standards, Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp is a great return for this long-neglected series and gives me hope for a follow-up that includes the DS games. While there isn’t much variety in the game modes, Advance Wars’ depth comes from the number of variables you can adjust to make every match feel unique. The biggest miss is the lack of multiplayer matchmaking, which makes it harder to get into a game than it ought to be in 2023, but at least you can play online. Playing against the AI will keep me interested in the short term, but I predict the inability to play against random opponents online will limit my spontaneous play sessions. However, the sheer number of maps, playable COs, and options for each match means that when I do, it's sure to be a unique experience.
