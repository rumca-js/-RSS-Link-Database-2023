## Chromebooks are dying fast and creating unnecessary e-waste

<p>You probably know that Chromebooks ship with a planned lifespan set by Google. A new report by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group claims that Google&rsquo;s practice, however, hurts both schools and the environment by essentially forcing customers to junk them after a given period of time.</p>



<p>The U.S. PIRG <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://pirg.org/edfund/resources/chromebook-churn-report-highlights-problems-of-short-lived-laptops-in-schools/&amp;xcust=2-1-1793248-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">argues</a> that this &ldquo;Chromebook churn&rdquo; is an artificial limit that essentially forces consumers and schools to toss out Chromebooks after a set period rather than let them expire though hardware faults or other causes. This contributes to e-waste, the group argues, as well as forcing additional costs through what it characterizes as planned obsolescence. </p>



<p>What the U.S. PIRG wants Google to extend the lifespan of Chromebooks to ten years, after which the devices could be recycled. One of the problems is, incidentally, that Chromebooks <em>aren&rsquo;t</em> recycled. Just a third of these ChromeOS devices are actually broken down and recycled while the rest apparently end up in landfills as e-waste. The U.S. PIRG also wants Google to work with Chromebook makers to design better <em>and</em> more compatible interchangeable hardware, so they&rsquo;ll simply last longer and be repaired if they don&rsquo;t.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We have a massive stuff problem,&rdquo; the PIRG&rsquo;s report says. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need most of it and too much of it is built to be disposable. We shouldn&rsquo;t allow&nbsp;planned obsolescence&nbsp;that keeps us buying more all the time. The least we can do, if we&rsquo;re giving every student in the U.S. a laptop, is ensure these devices are durable and repairable&mdash;not part of a constant churn.&rdquo;</p>



<p>To be fair, the lifespan of Chromebooks has gotten longer. As our lengthy<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/402141/chromebooks-versus-windows-laptops-which-should-you-buy.html"> explainer on laptops versus Chromebooks details</a>, Google now has extended the support lifespan of a Chromebook for about eight years and included ways of telling what how long the support clock will last before it runs out. Windows <em>used</em> to have an unlimited lifespan&mdash;although that ended with Windows 11, which now includes <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394763/windows-11-system-hardware-requirements.html">hardware requirements </a>that Microsoft seems to be <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/542121/microsoft-reveals-how-to-bypass-windows-11s-strict-hardware-requirements.html">lukewarm in enforcing</a>. (You can use Windows 10 instead). Google, like Microsoft, has enforced these limits for security&rsquo;s sake.</p>



<p>Still, setting limits on how long you can use a Chromebook for is, by definition, arbitrary. We&rsquo;ve already seen <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1431799/framework-laptop-chromebook-review.html">Chromebooks like the Framework Laptop Chromebook </a>come along and try to provide what the U.S. PIRG is asking for: a modular, repairable device where users can swap out a failing part. We&rsquo;ll have to see if Google agrees to take action.</p>

## Microsoft tests Windows taskbar tweaks you’ll actually care about

<p>Microsoft is testing tweaks to the Windows 11 taskbar that may return it&mdash;somewhat&mdash;to the glory days of Windows 10, according to reports by beta testers.</p>



<p>Microsoft is apparently testing two features: item labels, as well as the ability to ungroup items. A third, the ability to hide the date and time, is apparently being worked on as well.</p>



<p>Microsoft tests new features in both the Windows Insider Canary Channel and Dev Channel, both avenues for code, which may or may not eventually ship to actual mainstream users. Microsoft released a pair of new builds late on Wednesday: <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/04/19/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-23440/&amp;xcust=2-1-1793223-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Insider Build 23440 for the Dev Channel</a>, and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/04/19/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-25346/&amp;xcust=2-1-1793223-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Insider Build 23546 for the Canary Channel</a>. The Canary Channel is for the next iteration of Windows (Windows 12, hypothetically) while the Dev Channel focuses on Windows 11.</p>



<p>What Twitter leaker Albacore discovered, and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.windowslatest.com/2023/04/20/microsoft-leak-hints-show-labels-on-taskbar-and-more-features-coming-to-windows-11/&amp;xcust=2-1-1793223-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Windows Latest confirmed</a>, are the three new features. (Microsoft disclosed the ability to turn off date and time in its Build 23440 notes.)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Taskbar item labels (as well as ungrouped items) are indeed on their way to Windows 11 &#10024;<br />Here's a demo of the current state of the feature, definitely further along than last time we looked at it<br /><br />Fiddled with a few settings in the video so you can see how it reacts <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://t.co/7A7H0MWpJV&amp;xcust=2-1-1793223-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/7A7H0MWpJV</a></p>&mdash; Albacore (@thebookisclosed) <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/thebookisclosed/status/1648827082690949122?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=2-1-1793223-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">April 19, 2023</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>What you can&rsquo;t do, apparently, is move the Windows 11 taskbar around your screen, or expand it&mdash;you&rsquo;ll still need a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/549492/hands-on-stardocks-start11-largely-solves-the-sins-of-windows-11.html">third-party utility like Start11</a> to achieve that. But the ability to &ldquo;ungroup&rdquo; taskbar icons means less of a chance that you&rsquo;ll actually lose any tabs that you want to preserve. More explicit taskbar item labels will do the same.</p>



<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s new Dev Channel build also includes a few handy tweaks: the ability to turn on and manage <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/705519/windows-spotlight-adds-some-fun-back-to-windows-11.html">Windows Spotlight</a>, which adds personalized wallpapers, by right-clicking your desktop. You&rsquo;ll also be able to see a network troubleshooter when you right-click the taskbar and the network icon. Microsoft also hopes to tweak the taskbar&rsquo;s Search box by permitting a flyout when your hover over it, but Microsoft uncovered a glitch and killed it, the company said.</p>



<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s Canary Channel build offers familiar updates, too. In recent Dev Channel builds, Microsoft added <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1677931/adaptive-brightness-is-coming-to-more-windows-devices.html">features to control the screen brightness</a> automatically on supported laptops, as well as manage presence detection on similar devices. Those are being added to the Canary Channel. Microsoft is also offering an interesting new feature: the ability to turn off HDR support while running on battery. HDR actually dials up your screen brightness (when called for by the scene) to better improve visual fidelity&mdash;at the expense of your laptop&rsquo;s battery.</p>

## Used routers are leaking sensitive data. Don’t make the same mistake with your PC

<p>A report from ESET this week highlighted a surprising fact: Businesses selling old network equipment sometimes fail to wipe them of private data, leaving corporate IT secrets out and open in the wild.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.welivesecurity.com/2023/04/18/discarded-not-destroyed-old-routers-reveal-corporate-secrets/&amp;xcust=2-1-1792155-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">findings reveal</a> that of the 18 secondhand routers purchased by ESET researchers, half had been left exactly as when in use. Only five had gotten fully scrubbed of information about the network, credentials, and even physical building security. From the available data, hackers could glean usernames, password hashes, and other details useful for engineering an attack on the business. And the issue comes up repeatedly, as <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/used-routers-often-come-loaded-with-corporate-secrets/&amp;xcust=2-1-1792155-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Ars Technica</a> notes in its coverage of ESET&rsquo;s investigation.</p>



<p>This discovery might sound far removed from your life as an individual, but the lesson&mdash;and the warning&mdash;in this reveal is highly relevant. If you don&rsquo;t wipe your own devices before selling or recycling them (yes, including your home router), you&rsquo;re leaving yourself vulnerable to malicious actors.</p>



<p>Your PC is a primary example. Its storage drive(s) likely hold scads of sensitive data. Taxes, personal hobbies, budgets&mdash;the full spectrum of your life touches your computer. Just imagine if a malicious actor got hold of your old hard drive, where you left a plain text document with all your passwords on your desktop. At that point, it&rsquo;s sadly too late to wish you&rsquo;d been using a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407092/best-password-managers-reviews-and-buying-advice.html">password manager</a>, which would have protected against that kind of accidental access to your credentials. And the fallout could be incredibly damaging&mdash;financially at the worst, but at minimum your schedule and peace of mind will take a hit as you address the issue. So when it comes time to part ways with your PC, smartphone, or other tech gear, you should nuke the data on them properly.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img alt="Windows 11 Device encryption settings" class="wp-image-624606" height="497" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/win11deviceencryptionsetting.png?w=1200" width="947" /><figcaption><span>Device encryption can provide added protection when it comes time to reset your computer. If your Windows Home PC is compatible, you&rsquo;ll see this option in your settings.</span> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<p>You can actually take a preemptive step toward that goal now, by encrypting your devices (as applicable). Without the decryption key, the data is scrambled and unusable, and if the drive is then wiped, retrieving the data with the key afterward becomes difficult. To encrypt your PC, you can use one of these two methods:</p>



<ul><li>Most users with a Windows Home license will have <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/624593/is-your-windows-11-pc-encrypted-the-answer-is-surprisingly-complex.html">Windows device encryption</a> activated if you sign into your computer with a Microsoft account.&nbsp;</li><li>Windows Pro users can opt instead for <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/549444/how-to-encrypt-files-in-windows.html">BitLocker</a>, which offers more flexibility in management of the encryption.</li></ul>



<p>The caveat about encryption, of course, is that what locks out others can lock you out, too. You should maintain backup access to your decryption key, whether that&rsquo;s BitLocker&rsquo;s recovery key or ensuring you&rsquo;ll always have access to the Microsoft account controlling your Windows device encryption.</p>



<p>As for the actual wiping of your PC, you have a couple of options. Combined with device encryption, both methods become even more effective:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Faster, but less secure:</strong> When using Windows&rsquo; reset option, choose the version that also cleans the drive. However, while this action makes recovering data harder, it&rsquo;s still possible.</li><li><strong>More secure:</strong> Our guide to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/461014/how-to-securely-erase-your-hard-drive.html">securely erasing your drive</a> explains how to use software like Eraser (for hard disk drives) and commands like Secure Erase (for SSDs) to thoroughly and properly remove all traces of your data.</li></ul>



<p>What about smartphones? They follow a similar process, though even more simplified. Most have encryption on by default, making their basic reset option acceptable.</p>



<p>You may not have the resources of a corporate IT department, but you don&rsquo;t need to protect yourself better that one. As this research into business practices show, companies don&rsquo;t always follow the proper procedures. Be smarter than them and do things the right way.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about you, but when it comes to gaming peripherals and accessories, I like a big splash of color. From lilac purple to cerulean blue, the Logitech G305 Lightspeed wireless gaming mice are drop-dead gorgeous and come in a wide range of vibrant hues. Best Buy&rsquo;s currently <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flogitech-g305-lightspeed-wireless-optical-6-programmable-button-gaming-mouse-with-12000-dpi-hero-sensor-lilac%2F6420880.p%3FskuId%3D6420880&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed" rel="nofollow">selling them for just $39.99</a>, which is a savings of $10. If you&rsquo;re not a fan of bright colors, they&rsquo;re also available in your standard black or white. The specs and features are pretty good as well.</p>



<p>The Logitech G305 Lightspeed features a maximum DPI of 12,000, six programmable buttons, and a wireless range of ten feet. According to reviews on Best Buy, it&rsquo;s a fantastic mouse for gaming and office work. The 12,000 DPI is a little fast for day-to-day tasks, but you can always dial it down and then slowly work up to it. For just $39.99, it&rsquo;s definitely a good starter mouse option for the casual gamer. It also weighs just 99 grams, which is considered lightweight. This is a solid deal, so you better swoop in now before it expires. Game on, people.</p>

<h3 id="surfshark-in-brief">Surfshark in brief:</h3>



<ul><li>P2P allowed: Yes</li><li>Simultaneous device connections: Unlimited</li><li>Business location: The Netherlands</li><li>Number of servers: 3,200+</li><li>Number of country locations: 100</li><li>Cost: $12.95 per month, or $59.76 for a two year subscription</li></ul>



<p>Surfshark has, in the last few years, catapulted from basic VPN company to one-stop shop for all things personal online-security. The company now offers a top-tier VPN product that continues to improve on itself with each new iteration. And since its merger with NordVPN under the parent company Cyberspace, Surfshark has pushed into developing cutting-edge personal security features via its Nexus technology. This all sounds great, but are all of these features really worth it in a VPN service? We took Surfshark for a spin to find out.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Further reading:</strong> See our roundup of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3198369/privacy/best-vpn-services-apps-reviews-buying-advice.html">best VPNs</a> to learn about competing products.</p></blockquote>



<h2 id="surfshark-vpn-features-and-services">Surfshark VPN features and services</h2>



<p>When you initially open Surfshark you notice that the interface is clean and simple. On the left rail you have options for <em>VPN</em>, <em>Alert</em>, <em>Antivirus</em>, and <em>Settings</em>. In the middle there is a list of all server locations listed alphabetically by country and on the right there is a button to connect to the chosen server. It&rsquo;s nothing fancy, but the minimalist, straightforward interface was easy and intuitive to both navigate and use.</p>



<p>Surfshark prides itself on the number of servers it provides, which is well over 3,200 across 100 different country locations. There are admittedly a lot of countries that only have one server to connect to, but more popular locations such as the U.S., Canada, and Australia offer multiple server locations spread throughout. In addition to all of these server options, Surfshark allows unlimited simultaneous device connections. This is a big draw since most other VPN providers limit subscribers to five or six simultaneous connections.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Surfshark VPN" class="wp-image-1785833" height="686" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Surfshark-main-screen.png" width="1024" /><figcaption><p>The Surfshark app is clean and easy to navigate.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Sam Singleton</p></div>



<p>On the main screen, above the available servers, you&rsquo;re able to choose between three options: <em>Locations</em>, <em>StaticIP</em>, and <em>MultiHop</em>. <em>Locations</em> is a list of all of the available country servers you can connect to. <em>StaticIP</em> allows you to connect to shared servers with IP addresses that never change. <em>MultiHop</em> allows you to further obfuscate your actual location by routing your traffic through more than one external server. While many VPN services now offer multi-hop connections, Surfshark stands out by allowing the user to not only choose a predetermined route, but also create their own multi-hop route. This is a nifty feature that gives power users and those concerned with privacy more autonomy in securing and optimizing their connections.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Surfshark VPN" class="wp-image-1785835" height="768" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Surfshark-Antivirus-1.png" width="1024" /><figcaption><p>A Surfshark VPN subscription also includes access to the company&rsquo;s antivirus software.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Surfshark</p></div>



<p>Surfshark also provides an ad, tracker, and malware blocker called <em>CleanWeb</em>&mdash;though it&rsquo;s not turned on by default. It also offers a split-tunneling feature, which it calls <em>Whitelister</em>, that allows you the option to route apps and websites through the VPN or keep one or the other connected separately. This is a good option for those who wish to keep their web browsing secure via a VPN while keeping online games outside the VPN connection in order to minimize potential latency issues.</p>



<p>Additionally, Surfshark provides a kill-switch function that will automatically disable your internet connection should your VPN connection drop for whatever reason. There is also a feature called <em>NoBorders</em>, enabled by default, which is its own version of obfuscated servers. <em>NoBorders</em> allows users in countries that generally restrict VPN connections to maintain access to Surfshark.</p>



<p>Overall, it&rsquo;s a well-designed app that&rsquo;s easy to navigate, with a good feature set and plenty of useful tools. The only issue we could find with the service in general was the fact that when browsing connections, there&rsquo;s no easy way to find ping times or server-load indicators. We ultimately found this information in the options menu under <em>Speed Test</em>, but this information would be convenient to have listed under each server location.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>While many VPN services now offer multi-hop connections, Surfshark stands out by allowing the user to not only choose a predetermined route, but also create their own multi-hop route.</p></blockquote></figure>

</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Sam Singleton</p></div>



<p>Surfshark is also working hard to bring new and innovative ideas to the VPN scene. It&rsquo;s set to roll out its exclusive <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://surfshark.com/blog/surfshark-nexus&amp;xcust=2-3-397529-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Nexus VPN network</a> throughout 2023. Nexus is a single network made up of Surfshark VPN servers. There are huge potential security and privacy boosts from this technology. It will allow for rotating IP addresses without disconnecting your active VPN connection, further obfuscating your browsing activity. Nexus will also use a Dynamic MultiHop feature to connect you to the fastest available entry server and exit at any desired location, presumably optimizing connection speeds across the board. As of this writing, only the IP rotator feature is available, with the complete feature set due later this year.</p>

<p>During our testing we rated connection speeds across Surfshark&rsquo;s servers in five different countries around the world and then compared them to our baseline internet speed. Surfshark server speeds were solid, if not particularly outstanding. They averaged just over 61 percent of the base download speed and a slightly more impressive 72 percent of the base upload speed. That isn&rsquo;t the best we&rsquo;ve seen, but depending on your own home internet, it should be enough to stream HD video without any issues.</p>



<p>For those looking to use the service to bypass location restrictions on streaming websites, our testing showed that Surfshark was overwhelmingly successful. Across every server we tested and for all major streaming services the VPN was able to unblock everything. This included services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, HBO Max, Hulu, and Disney Plus. That result puts Surfshark among our very <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/618517/best-vpn-for-streaming-netflix.html">best VPNs for streaming Netflix</a> right along with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/398777/nordvpn-review-3.html">NordVPN</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/395012/expressvpn-review-2.html">ExpressVPN</a>.</p>



<h2 id="surfshark-vpn-security-and-privacy">Surfshark VPN security and privacy</h2>



<p>Surfshark states that it does not collect any of your online activity, including browsing history, session information, bandwidth used, connection time stamps, network traffic, or IP addresses. This no-logs policy claim was verified by the company Deloitte during an independent audit of Surfshark at the end of 2022. These are exactly the steps users should expect from a top VPN company and it goes a long way towards backing up Surfshark&rsquo;s privacy claims.</p>



<p>The service also keeps privacy in mind during setup. When signing up for a Surfshark subscription you only need to supply an email address. Furthermore, the company accepts payments via credit cards, PayPal, Google Pay, and various cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One thing of note is that Surfshark has moved its headquarters from the British Virgin Islands to the Netherlands in recent years. This shouldn&rsquo;t be too much of a concern as the Netherlands&rsquo; data retention laws are generally privacy-friendly. However, the Netherlands is still subject to Nine Eyes jurisdiction, which means that the government can force Surfshark to share certain information about customers.</p>

</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Sam Singleton</p></div>



<p>In regards to security, Surfshark uses standard AES 256-bit encryption. It also offers options for several VPN protocols including OpenVPN, WireGuard, IKEv2&mdash;depending on your operating system.</p>



<h2 id="is-surfshark-vpn-worth-it">Is Surfshark VPN worth it?</h2>



<p>Surfshark offers unlimited device connections, good speeds, compatibility with major streaming services, and an impressive number of country connections. The Windows app is well designed and easy enough to understand. It also has some nice extras such as ad, tracker, and malware blocking as well as split-tunneling and multi-hop.</p>



<p>With all of these great features, Surfshark is a solid all-around VPN service. If you opt for the two-year contract you&rsquo;re also getting all of this for a bargain price. And with the future addition of its Nexus network, Surfshark stands to potentially overtake its main competitors in the market. Overall, whether it&rsquo;s getting around region blocks or just enjoying a more private and secure browsing experience, Surfshark remains one of our favorites.</p>

## AUO teases the future of PC displays: You’ve never seen monitors like this

<p>We <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1470449/best-ultrawide-monitors.html">love a good ultrawide monitor</a> around here, and in fact I&rsquo;m using one for work right now &mdash; just don&rsquo;t tell anyone it&rsquo;s fast enough to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1439692/best-ultrawide-gaming-monitors.html">double as a gaming display</a>, too. But that brings up the Achilles heel of large-panel, high-resolution monitors: They can&rsquo;t go as fast in terms of hertz as smaller displays. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.auo.com/en-global/New_Archive/detail/News_Archive_Product_20230417&amp;xcust=2-3-1792932-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Panel supplier AU Optronics is aiming to fix that</a>, as they&rsquo;ve shown off a massive monitor design that wouldn&rsquo;t look out of place in a Samsung showroom, but is fast enough to satisfy the wallet-munching hardware of even the most affluent gamers. </p>



<p>The company&rsquo;s new 49-inch, 5K panel is already beating out most of the competition in several ways. That &ldquo;5K&rdquo; resolution and 32:9 aspect ratio isn&rsquo;t exactly precise, but on similar displays it means 5120&times;2160 resolution (4K, plus a little extra on both sides). With a 1000R curvature, it&rsquo;s also dramatically bent better immersion. But the truly impressive feat is driving all that screen at 360Hz, which should give your <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html">fancy new RTX 4090</a> something to do with its spare GPU cycles. Compare this to, say, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/monitors/gaming/49-odyssey-g9-gaming-monitor-lc49g97tssnxdc/&amp;xcust=2-3-1792932-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the Odyssey G9 DQHD</a>, which has the same size panel and a bit less resolution, but maxes out at &ldquo;just&rdquo; 240Hz. </p>

<p>But AUO isn&rsquo;t satisfied with being the fastest in that super-huge ultrawide category. The company also showed off a more modest 24-inch, 1080p gaming display with a face-melting speed of 540Hz. That beats the current record for a retail display, which goes to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1665236/alienware-aw2524h-monitor-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Alienware&rsquo;s AW2524H</a> (and some similar panels), by 8%. AUO isn&rsquo;t saying much else about the panels, which are currently being shown at the Display Innovation Taiwan Conference. </p>



<p>AUO is <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/398571/nvidias-face-melting-g-sync-esports-displays-hit-a-blistering-360hz.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">a B2B supplier of panels</a> to other companies, so you won&rsquo;t see any monitors emblazoned with its logo, but you will see its panels installed in other companies&rsquo; monitors&mdash;AUO shipped the world&rsquo;s first <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/411534/nvidias-first-hdr-g-sync-monitors-are-basically-the-holy-grail-of-pc-displays.html">1000-nit G-Sync HDR panels</a>, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/398571/nvidias-face-melting-g-sync-esports-displays-hit-a-blistering-360hz.html">360Hz esports panels</a>, and debut <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/399339/hands-on-with-the-worlds-first-miniled-laptop-msis-creator-17.html">mini-LED laptop screens</a>. When exactly you can expect that to happen is a bit nebulous, but it tends to take about a calendar year at the earliest for this kind of tech to go from trade show sample to retail product. </p>

## Acer preps OLED Predator monitor and a glasses-free 3D laptop

<p>The Predator X34 is a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/423971/acers-curved-predator-x34-g-sync-monitor-is-finally-ready-for-your-eyeballs.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">phenomenally popular line of monitors</a>, combining the common 34-inch, 1440p ultrawide form factor with great features and a competitive price. The series has had a few iterations, but the newest model jumps into the increasingly crowded gaming OLED space. You&rsquo;ll have to wait a bit for it, though: The Predator X34 V is hitting retail in most of the world in the fourth quarter of 2023, with a starting price of $1,300 USD. </p>



<p>But based on the specs, it might just be worth the wait. In addition to that gorgeous 3440&times;1440 curved OLED panel running at a zippy 175Hz, you get more than the usual number of connections on a gaming monitor. HDMI and DisplayPort are present, plus USB-C with access to the full speed of the panel, 65-watt chgarging for laptops, and four USB 3.2 ports for extra goodies. The screen includes a pair of 5-watt speakers in the chunky chin, and a small but notable improvement over previous X34 designs is the internal power supply&mdash;no huge brick necessary. The only downer appears to be a 250-nit max brightness, but that&rsquo;s rather typical of larger OLED panels. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Predator 3D Spatiallabs acer laptop" class="wp-image-1791946" height="949" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Predator-Helios-15-3D-PH3D15-71_left-facing.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Acer</p></div>



<p>Elsewhere in Acer&rsquo;s gaming announcements, the company is preparing to bring <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1681227/acers-glasses-free-3d-might-finally-be-ready-for-prime-time.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">the glasses-free 3D tech that Gordon saw at GDC</a> to retail. The Predator Helios 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition combines a stereoscopic display (tech you might have seen on the Nintendo 3DS a long time ago) with eye-tracking cameras, allowing the 3D game environment to dynamically adjust to your head&rsquo;s position to augment the 3D effect. Currently 70 titles work with the system, with more coming soon. The laptop comes with 13th-gen Intel processors and GPUs maxing out at an RTX 4080. It will cost $3,599 for the base model when it launches in June. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Predator 17 X gaming laptop" class="wp-image-1791948" height="811" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Predator-Triton-17-X-PTX17-71_right-facing.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Acer</p></div>



<p>The new Predator Triton 17 X uses its massive screen to spread out its high-powered hardware, resulting in a surprisingly sleek aluminum chassis that&rsquo;s less than an inch thick. Specs include processors up to a Core i9-13900HX, GPUs up to an RTX 4090, and a maximum of 64GB DDR5 RAM and 4TB of SDD storage. That&rsquo;s enough <em>oomph </em>to absolutely spank the latest AAA games and make a more than serviceable media creation machine, too. You&rsquo;ll have a nice view, whatever you&rsquo;re using it for: The 16:10 display is a mini-LED panel with 2560&times;1600 resolution and an impressive 250Hz refresh rate. The Triton 17 X launches in May for a starting price of $3,799. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Predator 16 Helios acer laptop" class="wp-image-1791949" height="856" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Predator-Helios-Neo-16-PHN16-71_coding_front-facing.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Acer</p></div>



<p>If your budget can&rsquo;t handle the latest ultra-thin gaming machines or cutting-edge 3D screens, there&rsquo;s the new Predator Helios Neo 16. This gaming laptop includes options for Intel 13th-gen processors and up to an RTX 4070 GPU, 43GB of DDR5 RAM, and a 2TB SSD. Pair it with a 16-inch 2560&times;1600 IPS screen, with a more-than-respectable 165Hz refresh rate and a 3ms response time, and you&rsquo;ve got yourself a gaming machine that can still run most brand-new games at high settings. The base model, which has to settle for a 1920&times;1200 screen at the same speed, will be $1,300 when it launches in May. </p>

## Acer’s new OLED-equipped Swift X 16 laptop is built for creative pros

<p>Acer sure pulled out all the stops with its new Swift X 16 laptop, announced today during an Acer event. Not only are we pretty darn impressed with the powerful hardware inside, but we also really dig the inclusion of a drop-dead gorgeous OLED display. If you&rsquo;re a creative professional, you better hold tight to your seats, because this is a designer&rsquo;s dream laptop. </p>



<p>From improved cooling to a bigger battery, this laptop really has it all. Acer&rsquo;s new Chromebook Spin 714 also snagged our attention, with its 2K webcam, zippy internals, and convertible form factor. Let&rsquo;s dig in.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>If you&rsquo;re in the market for a new machine, you should definitely check out our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/694436/best-laptops-for-graphic-design.html">best laptops for graphic design</a>.</p></blockquote>



<h2 id="acer-swift-x-16">Acer Swift X 16</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Swift X 16" class="wp-image-1791738" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Acer-Swift-X-16-SFX16-61G_lifestyle-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Acer</p></div>



<p>The new Acer Swift X 16 laptop is getting a serious boost in power, which is good news for video editors and graphic designers. It&rsquo;ll feature the latest AMD Ryzen 9 7940H CPU and Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 GPU as well as up to 2TB of SSD storage. When it comes to sheer power, that combination is positively deadly and I mean that in the best way possible. It will also have a TwinAir cooling system (larger fans), a bigger battery, and a spacious 16-inch OLED display with a productive 16:10 aspect ratio. The panel boasts a resolution of 3200&times;2000, a refresh rate of 120Hz, and a peak brightness level of 500 nits. Although we haven&rsquo;t personally tested this machine yet, based on those specs alone, visuals should be lovely and fluid. Acer truly seems to have designed this machine for hardcore creative pros.</p>



<p>My only nitpick is with the design, which is on the utilitarian side. It&rsquo;s fine, but nothing about it excites me. It&rsquo;s just a dark gray square&hellip; <em>that&rsquo;s it</em>. If you&rsquo;re looking for more flair, you may need to look elsewhere. That said, professionals often prefer to stick to straightforward aesthetics, and the powerful hardware inside of the machine definitely makes up for the boring design. This is a designer&rsquo;s laptop and if you&rsquo;re the kind of person that prefers function over form, I suspect you won&rsquo;t be disappointed in that regard. The chassis measures 17.9 mm and the weight is a little over four pounds. It&rsquo;s not the lightest laptop we&rsquo;ve ever seen here at PCWorld, but the additional heft isn&rsquo;t too surprising given the internal components inside the machine. </p>



<p>The Acer Swift X 16 launches this July with a starting price of $1,249.99. </p>



<h2 id="acer-chromebook-spin-714">Acer Chromebook Spin 714</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Chromebook Spin 714" class="wp-image-1791754" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Acer-Chromebook-Spin-714-CP714-2W_lifestyle.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Acer</p></div>



<p>I&rsquo;ve been a fan of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/608636/best-chromebooks.html">Chromebooks</a> for a while now. They&rsquo;re easy to set up and they&rsquo;re largely virus free. They&rsquo;re also solid everyday machines due to their low-powered hardware. But Acer aims to change that with the new Chromebook Spin 714. This convertible features a &ldquo;10 percent performance improvement&rdquo; over the previous models. It&rsquo;s packing the latest 13th-gen Intel Core processor, which is a solid boost in performance, as we&rsquo;ve seen with the laptops we&rsquo;ve reviewed here at PCWorld. We suspect loading times and web browsing will be zippier and more responsive. The 14-inch display, which can be folded back like a tablet, has an aspect ratio of 16:10 and a resolution of 1920&times;1200. That&rsquo;s plenty sharp for office work and day-to-day use.</p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s a cool factoid for you: The Chromebook Spin 714 is one of the first to include a 2K webcam, which is awesome if you do a lot of videoconferencing. It features temporal noise reduction, which keep things sharp in low-light environments, and a physical privacy shutter. The built-in dual microphones should (hopefully!) provide better audio overall. It also has Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2.</p>



<p>The Acer Chromebook Spin 714 launches this May with a starting price of $699.99.</p>

## New HP Envy laptops add IMAX, multicamera capabilities

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>HP&rsquo;s new Envy lineup of laptops includes the first IMAX Enhanced-certified PC, the company said, offering a breather to a line of PCs otherwise marketed at a growing cadre of on-the-go freelancers.</p>



<p>HP&rsquo;s new Envys will ship in three different sizes, with 14-inch, 15.6-inch, and 17.3-inch displays complementing the updated 13th-gen Intel Core processors inside them. (The 15.6-inch model also includes the option of Ryzen 7-series chips.) Only the two smaller versions are 360-degree convertibles; the 17-inch version is a traditional clamshell. The two 15- and 17-inch Intel-based laptopsship with Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 GPUs inside them, as well.</p>



<p>Those of us who work at an office don&rsquo;t appear to be HP&rsquo;s target. Instead, the new Envy lineup is aimed at the writers, consultants, communications executives, and others working on the go in coffee shops and communal workspaces. &ldquo;Select&rdquo; models of the new Envy lineup will be certified as <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/579816/marvel-movies-on-disney-plus-imax-enhanced.html">IMAX Enhanced</a>, which opens up the possibility of watching Disney+ on higher-quality screens, with DTS sound, and an expanded aspect ratio. You&rsquo;ll also need a subscription to Disney+, the service which is offering some of its latest Marvel and Pixar titles using the technology.</p>



<p>Presumably, that means those Envys will ship with a 4K screen, an option on (only) the 17.3-inch Envy. Otherwise, consumers will have the option of 1080p IPS displays&mdash;save for the 15.6-inch models, which will include the option of an OLED screen as well. OLEDs provide superior contrast to their IPS counterparts, thanks to per-pixel lighting; when the display manager requests a black pixel, the pixel can actually be turned off entirely. </p>



<p>The new Envys also include a pair of Thunderbolt 4 ports, offering expansion capabilities up to a pair of 4K displays via a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393714/best-thunderbolt-docks-for-a-laptop-pc.html">Thunderbolt dock</a>. The Ryzen versions, though, include just USB-C ports. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="HP Envy (2023) 17-inch" class="wp-image-1792118" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/HP-Envy-17.3-Laptop-PC-Natural-Silver_TopDown.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>A top-down look at the new HP Envy keyboard.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">HP</p></div>



<p>In a way, however, the IMAX certification is really just a distraction from a number of specific improvements that don&rsquo;t appear on other PCs. Take videoconferencing, for example: HP Presence 2.0 begins with features we&rsquo;ve seen elsewhere&mdash;virtual backgrounds, backlight adjustment, and auto framing&mdash;something we&rsquo;re starting to see in devices like the Surface Pro 9 (5G), with a Qualcomm Snapdragon chip inside. </p>



<p>HP has extended this to skin-color correction, with touches you might see in projectors: auto-alignment and keystone alignment, for example, so a camera focused on a presentation will align it properly. HP also uses the camera to put your Envy into sleep mode if you walk away, and to recognize you on your return, something we&rsquo;ve seen from laptop makers like Dell for some time.</p>



<p>Cameras are also used in yet another interesting tweak: multi-camera presentations. HP Presence can &ldquo;mix&rdquo; your laptop&rsquo;s camera with a standalone camera, so that presentation software like Teams or Zoom can see a video of you and a whiteboard, combined together into a single input. That&rsquo;s a nifty tweak on what&rsquo;s become a rather commonplace function, and one which might benefit from an <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393756/1080p-webcam-buying-guide.html">excellent standalone webcam</a>. Virtually all of the new Envys include a 5Mpixel depth camera to log you in; the exception is the 14-inch model, which uses a fingerprint reader instead. (A standalone <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394379/windows-hello-webcams-you-can-buy-right-now.html">Windows Hello webcam</a> will solve that problem.)</p>



<p>When not in use, the HP Envy&rsquo;s camera can be manually blocked via a manual camera shutter; HP is also one of the few manufacturers to include the option of disabling the mic for additional privacy. You can do that with a dedicated mic toggle, with an LED indicator to confirm your choice.</p>

<p>The two smaller Envys, as 360-degree convertibles (aka two-in-ones), also ship with the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/hp-rechargeable-mpp-20-tilt-pen&amp;xcust=2-1-1792066-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">HP Rechargeable Tilt Pen</a>, an MPP 2.0 stylus that now magnetically attaches to the side of the laptop. The pen ships with two different pen tips, and can last up to a year in standby, HP said.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ve summarized the specifications below. Note that there&rsquo;s a difference in battery life between the Ryzen and Core models; the Envy with a Ryzen inside should last about 13.5 hours of mixed usage, while the Core version should have a battery life of 15 hours, HP says.</p>



<p>HP said that the 14-inch HP Envy x360 is available now for $849.99. The 15-inch will be available later this month for $949.99 and up, while the 17-inch will ship in May for $1,149.99.</p>

## I paid for Microsoft Windows. Why does it push ads on me?

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>That copy of Windows on your PC was paid for by someone&mdash;generally the vendor who sold you the computer. In my case, I paid for it myself as a DIY builder.</p>



<p>So why does Microsoft nag me to use its product the way it thinks I ought?</p>



<p>It started in <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/419870/7-ways-windows-10-pushes-ads-at-you-and-how-to-stop-them.html">ads in Windows 10</a> about operating system features and other Microsoft products, which partially cooled off. (Thankfully.) But we&rsquo;re about to hit a new peak in Windows 11, where alerts will spread beyond the notification center. Now those kinds of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1668041/ads-in-the-windows-11-start-menu-are-definitely-coming.html">ads are headed for the start menu</a>, too. Not only that, but they&rsquo;re set to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1788516/windows-11-prepares-to-pester-you-for-using-a-local-account.html">badger people with local accounts</a>, highlighting reasons to sign in with a Microsoft account.</p>



<p>Y&rsquo;all. Respectfully, no.</p>



<p>First off, who ever won anyone over by annoying them? I&rsquo;ve spent years of my life as a Californian ignoring <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://oehha.ca.gov/proposition-65/about-proposition-65#:~:text=Proposition%2065%20requires%20businesses%20to,are%20released%20into%20the%20environment.&amp;xcust=2-1-1790329-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Prop 65 warnings</a>. (Okay, that&rsquo;s a lie&mdash;I am the kind of person who still notes which products have them, but they are excessive.) More to the point, Microsoft can&rsquo;t have forgotten <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/548995/clippys-back-to-troll-your-friends-on-teams.html">how much we all hated Clippy</a>. Twenty years is a long time, but not that long for a corporation of its size. If users haven&rsquo;t adopted your suggestions, it means they&rsquo;re not interested. Pushing us only causes dislike for the recommended products and services.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Clippy Microsoft Teams" class="wp-image-1725220" src="https://www.idg.se/editorial/980/path/1.758173.1635789720!imageUploader/2612809558.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" /><figcaption>If you &lsquo;re old enough to rent a car, you&rsquo;ll remember this annoyance from days gone by.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>Second, as a local account user who has watched the ground crumble around her, I don&rsquo;t appreciate being badgered about a conscious life decision. One that is <em>incredibly </em>deliberate, given <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/699100/microsoft-extinguishes-windows-11-pro-account-loophole-in-latest-build.html">how difficult it is</a> to set up a local account in Windows 11. I didn&rsquo;t accidentally click the wrong button and end up with one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I pay for a product or service, I expect to be able to use all of its features without issue. At the start, I&rsquo;ll take recommendations on hidden features, as well as potential dangers of the settings I&rsquo;ve chosen. That&rsquo;s reasonable and helpful. I&rsquo;ll also tolerate another round of reminders early on. But for this situation, where it&rsquo;s pretty obvious that only experienced (and determined) users would still pursue a local account option, Microsoft&rsquo;s pop-ups feel like a iron fist move, with only a thin velvet glove guiding me toward the company&rsquo;s preferred outcome&mdash;not mine. You know who rules with a heavy hand? Apple. You know <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1788067/i-dont-want-to-live-in-apples-world-but-i-sure-envy-it.html">what products I don&rsquo;t use as daily drivers</a>? Apple&rsquo;s.</p>



<p>Third, I may not own a product with a software license, but I still gave someone money and I don&rsquo;t expect to be low-key harassed in exchange. When Windows 10 first launched its ads, I thought they were fair. Irritating, but fair. Microsoft made upgrades free&mdash;something they&rsquo;d never done before&mdash;so I understood why they&rsquo;d remind people about Microsoft 365.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Microsoft 365 foto Microsoft" class="wp-image-1725454" src="https://www.idg.se/editorial/980/path/1.775847.1675415892!imageUploader/2869323279.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" /><figcaption>Microsoft 365 is <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1527859/6-reasons-why-its-worth-paying-for-a-microsoft-365-subscription.html">a good paid service</a> (as these things go), but shoving it into people&rsquo;s faces isn&rsquo;t going to attract people.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Microsoft</p></div>



<p>But Microsoft doesn&rsquo;t seem to understand that at the very least, it needs to make distinctions between types of users. Paid license for Windows 10 or 11? No nags. Twisted myself into a pretzel in order to keep a local account? No nags. Upgrade from Windows 7 or 8? Fine, hit me with your attempts to separate me from my money (or get access to more data about me and my habits).</p>



<p>I&rsquo;ve already written about <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1788084/every-time-i-use-windows-11-i-wish-i-were-using-windows-10.html">how working in Windows 11 depresses me</a>. I think it&rsquo;s a shame that Microsoft keeps implementing further ways to discourage positive associations with its latest operating system. I&rsquo;m pretty sure many hardworking teams contributing to Windows just want to put the best possible product forward. But as any teenager can tell you, repeated reminders to do something or try something don&rsquo;t work. Adults really aren&rsquo;t that different. We just have more money&mdash;and basic expectations when we spend it.</p>



<p>(P.S. &mdash; Linux users, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/820164/5-reasons-angry-nerds-switch-linux.html">I am not interested</a> in your favorite and probably esoteric distro that would never behave this way.)</p>

## Best budget monitors 2023: Screens that save you money

<p>The best modern monitors deliver stunning image quality, but pricing can quickly skyrocket above $500 and, in some cases, beyond $1,000. That&rsquo;s a lot of money to spend on a 24-inch to 32-inch display.</p>



<p>Fortunately, shoppers on a more reasonable budget can find numerous options available for around $200 (or less). These affordable monitors can&rsquo;t match those that sell for five times the price, but the best budget monitors offer surprisingly great image quality that might leave you wondering why anyone would pay more.</p>

<p>The Acer K242HYL is a reliable and attractive budget monitor that will fit the needs of most shoppers looking to buy a monitor for around $150.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a 24-inch, 1080p monitor with a refresh rate of up to 75Hz. The monitor&rsquo;s specifications are identical to alternatives near the same price, but the K242HYL&rsquo;s overall image quality is a notch above the pack. It provides a sharp, bright image with attractive and accurate color.</p>

<p>The monitor&rsquo;s 75Hz refresh rate is slightly smoother than the more typical refresh rate of 60Hz. Acer even throws in AMD FreeSync support, which can be used to sync the refresh rate with a connected AMD graphics solution. This will reduce stutter and screen tearing in 3D games.</p>

<p>Acer opts for a simple stand that only adjusts for tilt, which is typical for a budget monitor. The stand is reasonably tall and keeps the monitor planted on your desk. A 100x100mm VESA mount is included and can be used to attach a third-party monitor stand or arm if desired.</p>

<p>The monitor&rsquo;s design and build quality is excellent for the price. Our only serious complaint concerns connectivity, as the monitor has just one HDMI and one VGA. We&rsquo;d prefer to see a second HDMI port or DisplayPort, as well.</p>

<p>Still, shoppers looking for a simple, no-fuss option should stop looking and buy the K242HYL. It won&rsquo;t disappoint.</p>

<p>The Arzopa A1 Gamut is a 15.6-inch 1080p portable monitor with attractive image quality, a svealt design, and practical features at an affordable price. The display&rsquo;s profile is slim with a slight bulge on the lower half, where the ports and internal electronics live. An included faux-leather cover protects the display when stowed and serves as a kickstand when in use.</p>

<p>Our testing found the A1 Gamut can deliver up to 297 nits of brightness, which is superb for a budget portable monitor. The monitor also has an attractive color gamut and good color accuracy. Contrast is a bit lacking, but no more so than other budget portable monitors. Sharpness is a highlight, as 1080p resolution looks crisp when packed into a 15.6-inch panel.</p>

<p>The monitor has two USB-C ports with DisplayPort Alternate Mode and one Mini-HDMI port, for a total of three video inputs. Both USB-C ports support Power Delivery and can power the portable monitor from a connected USB-C device or a USB-C power brick. All necessary cables and accessories are included.</p>

<p>The Arzopa A1 Gamut&rsquo;s official MSRP hovers around $170, but it&rsquo;s frequently found on sale for as little as $110. We highly recommend waiting for a price drop if it&rsquo;s not currently on sale.</p>

<p>The Dell G2723H is a 27-inch 1080p gaming monitor with an impressive refresh rate of up to 280Hz. It looks great in motion, revealing detail in fast-moving objects and preserving clarity while quickly panning the camera in a 3D game. The monitor supports Nvidia G-Sync Compatible and AMD FreeSync Premium for smooth, tear-free gameplay.</p>

<p>Image quality is great for the price. The Dell G2723H looks bright and vivid thanks to its relatively wide color gamut and excellent color accuracy. Contrast is a bit low for a gaming monitor but, at this price, it&rsquo;s typical for the category. The monitor&rsquo;s native resolution of 1920&times;1080 is a good fit for the 280Hz refresh rate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dell&rsquo;s design is a highlight. The G2723H has a simple but attractive look that stands out from office monitors but stops short of garish. It&rsquo;s well built, too, with high-quality materials and a compact yet sturdy height-adjustable stand. The monitor offers multiple connectivity options including two HDMI 2.0 inputs and one DisplayPort 1.4.</p>

<p>The Dell G2723H debuted at an MSRP of $369.99, but Dell routinely slashes the price to as little as $199.99. That&rsquo;s an outrageously good deal. Though designed for gamers, the Dell G2723H is a solid pick for anyone who wants enhanced image quality on a tight budget.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-look-for-in-a-budget-monitor">What to look for in a budget monitor</h2>



<p>Budget monitors typically involve some sacrifice&mdash;costs are cut from somewhere, after all&mdash;so you want to know what features matter most for the money.</p>



<h3 id="image-quality">Image quality</h3>



<p>Budget monitors have a reputation for lackluster image quality. Recent models buck that trend. While some sub-par budget models remain on the market, all the monitors we recommend in this guide nail the fundamentals. They offer a bright, vivid, and colorful image that&rsquo;s enjoyable and comfortable to view even in a brightly lit room.</p>



<h3 id="resolution">Resolution</h3>



<p>Nearly all budget monitors provide a native resolution of 1920&times;1080, also known as 1080p. You may find 1440p or 4K monitors available at similar pricing, but they often sacrifice other aspects of image quality. 1080p is popular for a reason: It&rsquo;s attractive, versatile, and good value for money.</p>



<h3 id="refresh-rate-and-adaptive-sync">Refresh rate and adaptive sync</h3>



<p>Most budget monitors have a refresh rate of 60Hz to 75Hz. Only gaming monitors reach a higher refresh rate, and gamers are the only group that needs to pay attention to this specification. Gamers will want to aim for 144Hz or better. Everyone else will be happy with a 60Hz display.</p>



<p>Adaptive Sync is a related feature that can sync the output of a graphics solution or video card with the monitor. This eliminates screen tear and micro-stuttering. It&rsquo;s a must-have feature for gamers and can be ignored by everyone else.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="connectivity">Connectivity</h3>



<p>Budget monitors have simple connectivity with just a handful of video inputs. You&rsquo;ll want to purchase a monitor that has a video input compatible with your laptop or desktop&rsquo;s video output. Most computers support HDMI, but a few desktops and laptops only support DisplayPort. PCs that are more than 10 years old may only support VGA and DVI, and some budget monitors still support these options. Our top pick, the Acer K242HYL, supports HDMI and VGA.</p>



<h3 id="stand-and-ergonomics">Stand and ergonomics</h3>



<p>Inexpensive monitors usually skimp on ergonomics and offer a simple, integrated stand that only adjusts for tilt. That&rsquo;s fine for web surfing and general productivity, but a height adjustable stand will be preferable if you want a monitor for your home office or plan to use multiple monitors side-by-side.</p>



<p>At the least, a budget monitor should provide a 100x100mm VESA mount. This standard mount size can be used with a huge variety of third-party stands and arms&mdash;the options are nearly endless. Portable monitors are the exception and rarely include support for a VESA mount.</p>



<h2 id="how-we-test-monitors">How we test monitors</h2>



<p>PCWorld&rsquo;s monitor buying guides are based on the knowledge and skills of our freelance and staff contributors, who together possess decades of experience in the field.</p>



<p>While we rely on our personal impressions to guide coverage, we also thoroughly test each monitor with a SpyderXElite color calibration tool for an in-depth analysis. This tool lets us objectively evaluate various monitor attributes, such as brightness, contrast, color gamut, color accuracy, luminance and color uniformity, gamma, and more.</p>



<p>Every monitor we recommend in this guide was thoroughly reviewed with personal, hands-on testing by a PCWorld contributor. This helps us identify problems in features and build quality that could otherwise be overlooked.</p>
