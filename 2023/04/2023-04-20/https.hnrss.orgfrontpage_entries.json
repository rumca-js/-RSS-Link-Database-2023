Here\u2019s a 3 minute demo video: <a href=\"https://d3399nw8s4ngfo.cloudfront.net/videos/intro-to-retool.mp4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://d3399nw8s4ngfo.cloudfront.net/videos/intro-to-retool...</a>.<p>You can think of Retool as something like Visual Basic, but in the cloud. The idea is that there are lots of internal applications that businesses need, and today, build from scratch (probably via React). But while React is great for many things (our landing page is built in React, our product is built in React, etc.), it\u2019s possible that it might be overkill for building a simple form that POSTs data back to your API. (Who _wants_ to worry about debouncing the submit button, handling errors from the backend, and authenticating and authorizing the users?)<p>We launched on HN around five years ago (<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17725966\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17725966</a>). Since then, we\u2019ve launched three new products \u2013 a native mobile product (<a href=\"https://retool.com/products/mobile\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://retool.com/products/mobile</a>), an automation product for developers (<a href=\"https://retool.com/products/workflows/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://retool.com/products/workflows/</a>), and a database product (<a href=\"https://retool.com/products/database/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://retool.com/products/database/</a>).  We\u2019ve hired and grown the team to over 350, and are proud to have businesses like Doordash, NBC Universal, Mercedes Benz, and the NFL using Retool.<p>The network at Retool is also fairly strong \u2014 our lead investors in the Series B and C were Sequoia, along with Elad Gil, Nat Friedman, as well as John and Patrick Collison. Other investors include the founders of Github, Gusto, Segment, PagerDuty, Plaid, etc.<p>This year, while other companies are downsizing, we\u2019re doubling down. (Literally.) We\u2019re attempting to double our engineering, product, and design orgs this year. We think the opportunity to invent the future of programming is enormous, and we\u2019re looking for more hackers to join our team.<p>We think that AI is going to change the way people build software. We think that there is tremendous potential in building interfaces that help humans and AI collaborate together to build software. We want to build a world where humans can quickly assemble full applications by just providing high level directions to AI.<p>We believe we\u2019re set up especially well to do just that \u2013 we have all the building blocks for creating software (frontends, backend compute, data storage) as well as a live interactive builder environment. Why entangle yourself with messy things like Webpack, Docker, and Kubernetes when you can directly manipulate a live app, running right in front of you?<p>We also think that the world, as a whole, is under-utilizing AI. Businesses are broadly interested in generative AI and LLMs, but don\u2019t know how yet to leverage and use them. It should be simple for businesses to quickly set up flows to have AI automatically triage bug reports, summarize customer feedback, and enrich datasets.<p>We\u2019ve shared a sneak peak of what we think some of this could look like (<a href=\"https://retool.com/blog/gpt4-in-retool/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://retool.com/blog/gpt4-in-retool/</a>), and there\u2019s a bunch more coming up that we\u2019re really excited to talk about soon.<p>If you\u2019re interested in working with AIs and LLMs to change the way companies build software, we\u2019d love to hear from you. We've made multiple hires from HN in the past, so we\u2019re posting here. But if you know any friends who are interested, feel free to tell them to reach out as well.<p>Please email us at snir AT retool with \u201cHN\u201d in the subject line.<p>Thanks!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35646253\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35646253</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35646253", "date_published": "2023-04-20 21:00:30+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Spinning Diagrams with CSS", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://x.st/spinning-diagrams-with-css/\">https://x.st/spinning-diagrams-with-css/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35646199\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35646199</a></p>\n<p>Points: 86</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>", "link": "https://x.st/spinning-diagrams-with-css/", "date_published": "2023-04-20 20:57:54+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Diagnosing cancer by profiling the immune system", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://github.com/jostmey/msm\">https://github.com/jostmey/msm</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35646093\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35646093</a></p>\n<p>Points: 23</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>", "link": "https://github.com/jostmey/msm", "date_published": "2023-04-20 20:50:48+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Large language models: Scaling laws and emergent properties", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://cthiriet.com/articles/scaling-laws\">https://cthiriet.com/articles/scaling-laws</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35646047\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35646047</a></p>\n<p>Points: 7</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>", "link": "https://cthiriet.com/articles/scaling-laws", "date_published": "2023-04-20 20:46:52+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Babylon.js 6.0", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.babylonjs.com/\">https://www.babylonjs.com/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35645857\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35645857</a></p>\n<p>Points: 29</p>\n<p># Comments: 9</p>", "link": "https://www.babylonjs.com/", "date_published": "2023-04-20 20:31:50+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Rural Americans are importing tiny Japanese pickup trucks", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/04/20/rural-americans-are-importing-tiny-japanese-pickup-trucks\">https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/04/20/rural-americans-are-importing-tiny-japanese-pickup-trucks</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35645624\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35645624</a></p>\n<p>Points: 103</p>\n<p># Comments: 97</p>", "link": "https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/04/20/rural-americans-are-importing-tiny-japanese-pickup-trucks", "date_published": "2023-04-20 20:10:50+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "evidence.dev \u2013 Business Intelligence as Code", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://evidence.dev\">https://evidence.dev</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35645464\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35645464</a></p>\n<p>Points: 7</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>", "link": "https://evidence.dev", "date_published": "2023-04-20 20:01:27+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Gov.

Maybe I will also add featured listings on the site, still need to think about this though.<p>I would love to receive feedback about the website and business idea in general.<p>Thank you</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35643223\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35643223</a></p>\n<p>Points: 17</p>\n<p># Comments: 9</p>", "link": "https://banklist.io/", "date_published": "2023-04-20 17:23:47+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Bark \u2013 GPT-style realistic multilingual text-to-speech generation", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://github.com/suno-ai/bark\">https://github.com/suno-ai/bark</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35643219\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35643219</a></p>\n<p>Points: 45</p>\n<p># Comments: 6</p>", "link": "https://github.com/suno-ai/bark", "date_published": "2023-04-20 17:23:35+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "Google DeepMind", "description": "<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.deepmind.com/blog/announcing-google-deepmind\">https://www.deepmind.com/blog/announcing-google-deepmind</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35643049\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35643049</a></p>\n<p>Points: 200</p>\n<p># Comments: 114</p>", "link": "https://www.deepmind.com/blog/announcing-google-deepmind", "date_published": "2023-04-20 17:11:36+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage", "title": "GoGoGrandparent (YC S16) is hiring a senior/staff back end/full-stack engineer", "description": "<p>About us: \nWe're a digital caregiver that helps older & disabled adults avoid retirement communities and age well in their own homes.

I am bit anxious sharing it since I barely knew how to code in Python before but I was simply amazed on how much GPT was able to help me write something that actually works (I hope).<p>My goal was to create a library that empowers people to ask questions from their data, regardless of its source. InsightFlow does just that, it has some modules that allow s parsing information existing in (for now) video (its audio part), html, and in general text and provides a chat interface on top.<p>I would love to expand this to image and eventually video parsing. I know there are some companies that aim for the same but I could not find an opensouce alternative for it. I tried making it modular so different modalities can be added later on.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a
