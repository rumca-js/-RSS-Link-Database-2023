<p>The side missions in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dead-island-2/">Dead Island 2</a> introduce you to many strange characters. Few, however, are weirder than Francesca. She's an artist in Beverly Hills, but in the zombie apocalypse, she's taken to using the undead as art supplies. Across a series of five missions, collectively called <strong>Body Art</strong>, you'll want to supply her with the hard-to-find body parts she needs in exchange for XP and other rewards. Here's where to find the Body Art items, including oversized arm bones, chthonic ichor, infected spines, blade arms, and mutated hearts.</p><div><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a href="https://www.gamespot.com">hide</a>]</span><ul class="collapse in" id="toc_list"><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com">Body Art: Heft - Oversized arm bones</a></li></ul></div><p>Body parts drop using an RNG system, meaning it's randomized and you won't <em>always</em> get the drop you need from the enemy who has a chance to drop it. But they are also exclusive to particular enemy types, so these are your only shot at getting the parts you need. Also note that the <strong>mutator </strong>enemy type, while not seen in-game until you've finished the story and still bound by the RNG system, may drop each of these items listed below, as the mutant is a grotesque amalgam of all other Apex Variants, or special infected, as you may prefer calling them.</p><h2 id="Body_Art__Heft___Oversized_arm_bones">Body Art: Heft - Oversized arm bones</h2><p>Oversized arm bones can be found on <strong>crushers</strong> and their variants.

## Best Zelda Bosses Of All Time

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1595/15950357/4127659-ocarinaoftimeganon.png" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">For as long as Link has been adventuring his way through the land of Hyrule, there have been harrowing boss battles to match. The best Zelda bosses cleverly utilize the unique qualities of the equipment found in their corresponding dungeon, putting your skills to the test or forcing you to think about the new mechanics in a creative new way. And since the Zelda series is steeped in lore with consistent monster types, we've seen lots of different interpretations of similar creatures, or even super-sized versions of standard enemy types. Part of the joy of a new Zelda game is discovering all the ways that Nintendo has reimagined Zelda enemies and how to deal with them using your new array of equipment.</p><p dir="ltr">The series has been going on for more than 35 years so it's chock full of inventive, harrowing, and brilliantly designed bosses. It would be almost impossible to rank them all, so we've selected just over a dozen of our absolute favorites. These are the best Zelda bosses of all time, presented in no particular order.</p><p dir="ltr">Here's hoping the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom adds even more memorable boss fights to the list. Be sure to read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-preorder-guide/1100-6492963/">Tears of the Kingdom preorder guide</a> as we quickly approach its launch. And for more on The Legend of Zelda, check out our ranking of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-zelda-games-ranking-the-series-ahead-of-tears-of-the-kingdom/2900-3788/">best Zelda games</a>, along with our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-legend-of-zelda-dungeons-of-all-time/2900-4704/">favorite Zelda dungeons</a>.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Blind the Thief (A Link to the Past)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4127495-alttp_blind_the_thief_sprite.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Blind the Thief is one of the greatest fake-outs in the Zelda series. On a quest to rescue the seven maidens who have formed a living seal around Ganon in the Dark World, Link discovers the Maiden sitting in plain sight in Thieves' Town, rather than encapsulated in crystal like the prior Maidens. After a little handiwork with a bomb to create a makeshift skylight, you can guide this Maiden into the sunlight to expose her true form, Blind the Thief. Blind's Dark World form is a creepy demon head floating on a ghostly body. The ensuing boss battle is Zelda by way of bullet hell shooters, as you slash at the disembodied head while dodging a barrage of fireballs. After defeating Blind you discover the real Maiden, of course, but the expectation-subverting puzzle was half the fun.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Ganon (Ocarina of Time)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4127498-xholypuffxyoutube.png" /><br /><h3><p>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is prototypical by today's standards, but its final battle against Ganon set the standard for epic final encounters in the burgeoning 3D era. After defeating Ganondorf, King of Thieves in an encounter that recalled your earlier fight against Phantom Ganon, he transformed into the monstrous pig-monster we all know and love to hate. The newly empowered Ganon towered over Link to an incredible degree, and as the final battle dodging his massive dual blades was a real test of skill for the then-new Z-Targeting system. When he was finally brought down to earth, it felt very satisfying to slash away at his monster face until evil was vanquished.</p><p><em>Image: XHolyPuffX on Youtube</em></p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Helmasaur King (A Link to the Past)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4127496-alttp_helmasaur_king_sprite.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">The Dark World in Link to the Past starts with one of the less useful items, the Magic Hammer, making for a somewhat underwhelming start--even if it is very fun to squish down those pegs you see sitting around the overworld. But it's made worth it for the encounter with the Helmasaur King. A giant lizard creature with a swaying, barbed tail is protected with a tough mask that almost none of your weapons can penetrate. Bombs do the trick, but it just feels better to whack away with your hammer, chipping away pieces until the mask breaks entirely and exposes its weak point. From there the boss battle is a walk in the park, but this one gets kudos for taking an otherwise very limited utility item and making it the most satisfying way to crack into his shell.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Dark Link (Ocarina of Time)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4127497-dark_link_oot.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Dark Link has appeared across several Zelda incarnations, but the sub-boss appearance in the Ocarina of Time Water Temple is the most memorable. At the time it was a reference to the final boss encounter of Zelda 2, translated to a 3D space with thoughtfulness and grace. Dark Link appears on a shimmering pool of shallow water, and his attacks echo your own arsenal of moves. In a particularly nice touch, Dark Link's life total will mirror your own, even if you've expanded your health bar with extra heart pieces. It's an evocative concept and Ocarina of Time was the first time it really nailed the feeling of a demonic doppelganger.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Dodongo (The Legend of Zelda)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4127499-tloz_dodongo_sprite.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">The Dodongo is a classic Zelda boss that occasionally moonlights as a standard dungeon enemy, but we have to give credit to the very first appearance for standardizing the inventive concept. Dodongo is always heavily armored in such a way that most of your weapons are useless, and the only way to defeat it is to trick it into swallowing a bomb carefully placed directly in its path. The original Legend of Zelda imagined it looking like a Triceratops, which made enough sense with its heavy armor plating. Subsequent games have reimagined it as a more fantastical lizard creature, but all of them have retained the core concept of a thick armored hide that can only be destroyed from within.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Gohma (The Wind Waker)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4127503-gohma%28ww%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">The Gohma has been a recurring boss since the first Legend of Zelda game, but its appearance in The Wind Waker recontextualizes it as Link intervening slightly in a clash of titans. The giant creature, which looks like a centipede mixed with a scarab, occupies a huge lava pool. None of Link's weapons seem to scratch it, but a swaying tail hangs precariously over the battlefield. Instead of doing battle with Gohma directly, Link tugs on the tail. The added weight makes the stone platform overhead collapse onto the Gohma's head, cracking its defenses. After a few rounds of this its soft inner workings are exposed and he can defeat the beast.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Genie (Link's Awakening)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4127500-lans_genie_model.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Link's Awakening is an oddity in the Zelda canon, in part because its dreamlike setting brings in such strange characters and enemies. This is a Zelda game that includes Goombas and a Chain Chomp. So the Genie boss of Bottle Grotto is, to put it mildly, very strange. It's a cackling clown-like specter who lives in a bottle and tosses fireballs at you. The sheer mechanical simplicity of the boss encounter, though, is what earns it a spot on this list. The Genie spends time mocking you and pointing out that he's invulnerable thanks to his bottle, and wouldn't you know it, this dungeon just gave you a glove that lets you pick up heavy objects. After smashing the bottle against the wall he'll grow enraged and attack that much harder, giving a tidbit of story context to an otherwise very story-light encounter.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Koloktos (Skyward Sword)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4127507-sshd_koloktos_model.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">The boss of the Ancient Cistern is a collection of loose golden limbs held together by dark magic that sizzles between its seams. Seemingly inspired by Indiana Jones, this battle in the midst of a tomb-like setting relies on Link's whip. After tempting Koloktos to slap at him and dodging out of the way, you can grab onto a limb with the whip and yank it away, breaking away his protections to expose the beating heart that his hands were guarding. Aside from being a precise skill-testing exercise with tons of personality, Koloktos is also just beautiful to look at, taking full advantage of the stylized art for its shimmering gold body parts.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Evil Eagle (Link's Awakening)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4127501-lans_evil_eagle_model.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Evil Eagle is another uncharacteristic choice from Link's Awakening. It almost seems like a Mega Man battle, especially with a flapping wing attack that can knock you clear off the map and back into the Eagle's Tower. And while most of the side-scrolling segments in Link's Awakening are little interstitials between pieces of the proper dungeon, Evil Eagle takes place entirely within this perspective. It's an unusually action-packed battle that reminds players that even when you're nearing the end of a Zelda game, Nintendo can still surprise you with its inventiveness.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Fyrus (Twilight Princess)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4127504-fyrus_title.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Twilight Princess took the series in a darker new direction, and that was clearly illustrated in the intro to the Fyrus, the Twilit Igniter. Upon entering the boss room Link saw Fyrus held prisoner in the darkness, bound by chains and breathing heavily. Upon detecting Link, it reenergizes and lights itself ablaze, breaking the chains and chasing Link down, wielding those same chains as weapons. From there the battle requires some quick thinking and reflexes--you have to blind the beast with an arrow to the head, and then as it stumbles around blindly, you equip the Iron Boots to plant yourself in the ground and hang on tight to his chains to trip him.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Arrghus (A Link to the Past)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4127502-alttp_arrghus_sprite.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">The floating squid-like creature that guards the Swamp Palace is another, like the Helmasaur King, that needs your specialized new equipment to expose the weak point. This time, though, the giant eye creature is surrounded by a nest of its young, forcing you to pull them away one by one using the Hookshot. Grabbing ghoulies with the hook and then slashing away at them one by one until Arrghus is exposed just feels great, and makes the entire battle feel both tense and fulfilling once you peel back the layers.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Stallord (Twilight Princess)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4127505-stallord_head.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">One of the few Zelda bosses to center around use of a mount, of sorts, Stallord takes full advantage of your new Spinner mode of conveyance. The massive set of dragon bones rises out of the sand but has a weak spine that you can ram into with the Spinner to set it off. From there it starts producing bony minions that act like plinko pegs, bounding off from one to another as you try to connect with the spine again. After enough hits it goes down, but it all seems just a little too neat and tidy--until the disembodied head rises again and starts breathing fire. Then you'll need to pull off some fancy Spinner-riding as you pivot from track to track dodging its attacks and getting in close enough to do damage, eventually defeating the bony beast.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Goht (Majora’s Mask)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1585/15855271/4127506-mm3d_goht_intro.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">The Ocarina of Time sequel is known for its Link-transforming mask abilities, which led to some memorable boss fights. Among them Goht reigns supreme, a giant mechanical bull-like creature that charges in circles around a battlefield far too quickly for you to dodge by normal means. Instead, you have to don the Goron mask and roll like one of the rock creatures. By chasing Goht around the circle as well, you can gain ground and attack it from behind. It shows what Zelda does best, by taking the power-ups you've already been using and recontextualizing them in an exciting new way.</p></h3></p><br />

## The Mandalorian Needs To Figure Out What Story It's Telling

<p>This season of The Mandalorian has been frustrating in all new ways, delivering some of the best episodes of the series right next to some of the worst. But more annoying than the inconsistent quality has been its aggressively incoherent overall plot. Everything about Season 3 was disjointed, disconnected--a series of things that were happening on the screen, nothing more. Some of those things were very awesome, and some of them were very much not awesome, but none of them added up to anything. Season 3 of The Mandalorian is all parts and no sum.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>It should go without saying that we are dealing with heavy spoilers from Season 3 of The Mandalorian from here on out. Consider yourself warned.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Here's one illustration: Early in "Chapter 23: The Spies," we got several shots of the massive Mandalorian fleet cruising above Nevarro. We saw several drop ships like the one Bo-Katan flies, we saw the gigantic Imperial light cruiser that served as the flagship, and we saw a bunch of other small and medium-sized ships that would serve as the fleet's backbone.

multiplayer--you probably don't <em>always </em>want to wear a headset. A good set of computer speakers can also elevate your gaming experience; there is even a growing market of speakers designed specifically for gaming. We've rounded up the best computer speakers in 2023. Out list includes a mix of gaming speakers and regular PC speakers..</p><p>PC speakers have come a long way in the past few years, and you can get an excellent audio setup for your PC without spending hundreds of dollars (though that’s always an option if you want the very best). In fact, many PC speakers these days support 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound and take up just a few inches on your desk. Manufacturers are even adding features found in their gaming headsets. For example, the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arena-Computer-Gaming-Speakers/dp/B09KNYJL4R?tag=gamespot-pcspeaker-20">SteelSeries Arena</a></strong> line of speaker systems has support for Sonar, the audio software suite that gives users personalized control over their audio experience.</p><p>Our list of the best computer speakers features products of all shapes and sizes, including traditional dual desktop speakers, sound systems with big subwoofers, and even <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Leviathan-Full-Range-Bluetooth-Smartphones/dp/B0BCCCNHD8?tag=gamespot-pcspeaker-20">gaming soundbars</a>. Whether your <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Creative-USB-Powered-Down-Firing-Subwoofer-Far-Field/dp/B07NWLWM9B?tag=gamespot-pcspeaker-20">budget is $50</a> or $500, we think there's a computer speaker on this list that will appeal to you. Thankfully, there are great options that barely take up any space on your gaming desk, but there are some stellar sound systems that you may have to reorganize your setup to accommodate. Most of our picks are focused on PC gaming, but most of these speakers are great for non-gaming audio and will even work in a pinch for console gaming, too.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-computer-speakers/1100-6499140/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## How Diablo 4 Is Being Built For A Modern Audience

<p dir="ltr">It has been over a decade since the release of Diablo III, and despite the game's enduring success and release on nearly every modern system, Blizzard knew that Diablo IV had to feel like a modern game--one that is still quintessential Diablo, but with updates to make it appeal both to longtime fans and to first-time players.</p><h2 dir="ltr">More players in more places</h2><p dir="ltr">Speaking to GameSpot prior to the announcement of the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-server-slam-test-will-let-you-play-early-and-blizzard-wants-you-to-push-it/1100-6513446/">Server Slam</a> beta test, director Joe Shely emphasized one of the biggest launch-day differences between Diablo IV and its predecessors: It's shipping on consoles and PC at the same time. It's a decision that, in the day of cross-play across devices and even generations, brought it in line with many other current online games.</p><p dir="ltr">"When we released the console version of [Diablo III], we saw lots of people who had never played Diablo before who got to play Diablo for the first time," Shely said. "And so when we thought about how to bring Diablo IV to people, we knew that we had a bunch of audiences--from people who had played Diablo at all kinds of different items in their lives… played different Diablo games, and that all of those people were people who would want to have a great time in Diablo IV."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4-is-being-built-for-a-modern-audience/1100-6513447/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Diablo 4 Server Slam Test Will Let You Play Early, And Blizzard Wants You To Push It

<p dir="ltr">Blizzard has already held two beta periods for Diablo IV as we approach the game's June 6 launch, but today it announced yet another, and this one sounds intense. Dubbed Server Slam, the test will run from May 12-14 on all platforms and aims to help the development team better prepare for the massive horde of players sure to be waiting to play on launch day. Progress from this test won't transfer to the full game, but it is another opportunity to try the game ahead of its launch, as the Server Slam will be freely available to anyone who wants to participate. Those who reach level 20 and defeat the Ashava world boss will receive the Cry of Ashava mount trophy.</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot had the chance to chat with director Joe Shely and associate director Joseph Piepiora about Server Slam and learned just how important this pre-launch period is for the game.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's always been the plan for us to do everything that we can to make sure the launch is as stable as possible," Shely told us. "So the first thing we did was the early access weekend, and then we did the open beta. And the open beta and the early access weekend both allowed us to get lots of feedback that we were able to incorporate into the game.

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo IV's</a> endgame Helltides will allow for target-farming of specific item slots, giving players more control over their progression.</p><p dir="ltr">In Blizzard's most-recent Diablo IV <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT9fxgSRCVI">livestream</a>, the developer offered more details on the upcoming ARPG's various <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-endgame-grind-is-a-combination-of-challenging-dungeons-and-open-world-activities/1100-6512997/">endgame systems</a>, one of which is Helltides. Certain areas of Diablo IV's world will be temporarily afflicted by these hellish storms, where the sky turns red and more challenging enemies spawn.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">Players will be able to seek out loot caches within these Helltide areas, with each cache corresponding to a specific item slot. Killing monsters in Helltides will earn players Cinders, which are used to unlock the caches. The cost of a specific cache will vary depending on the item slot it offers. For example, a weapon cache will be more costly than a cache for boots. As long as a player has the required amount of Cinders, they can open multiple caches over the duration of the event. For those who are looking for specific legendary or unique items to complete their builds, Helltides seem like a great way to grind for them.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-will-let-you-target-farm-for-the-perfect-item/1100-6513452/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Al Pacino has a storied career, appearing in The Godfather trilogy, Scarface, Heat... the list goes on. But apparently, the Oscar-winning actor had a chance to sit down across from Greedo in Star Wars.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking to <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/al-pacino-star-wars-1235589913/">Variety</a>, Pacino says he passed on playing Han Solo back in the 1970s. "Well, I turned down Star Wars. When I first came up, I was the new kid on the block, you know what happens when you first become famous. It's like, 'Give it to Al.' They'd give me Queen Elizabeth to play," he said.</p><p dir="ltr">"They gave me a script called Star Wars. ...They offered me so much money. I don't understand it.

## XDefiant Delivers The CoD Experience Many Have Been Asking For

<p dir="ltr">Ubisoft's XDefiant is currently in closed beta, allowing us to get hands-on time with this free-to-play first-person shooter. The game doesn't come packed with any real innovations, but it did surprise me in how well it delivers a classic arcade shooter with really enjoyable maps.</p><p dir="ltr">XDefiant is a curious mashup of Ubisoft properties. This shooter brings together characters and settings from other big Ubisoft titles, including Tom Clancy's The Division, Watch Dogs, Far Cry 6, and more. The game doesn't seem to have a storyline to tie all these characters together, but the matches are quite fun, so I don't even question the lack of game lore or shared connections. Although jumping from a Far Cry-themed map to a Division one in New York City--each with corresponding announcers--might sound jarring, I didn't find that to be the case.</p><p dir="ltr">XDefiant uses factions, which are basically just different playstyle classes with their own unique passive, active, and ultra abilities. There are four factions currently available in this closed beta, featuring the Cleaners from The Division, Echelon from Splinter Cell, Phantoms from Ghost Recon, and Libertad from Far Cry 6. The Echelon faction allows you to make sneaky plays with active camo, while Libertad's abilities are all about healing yourself and teammates. The Cleaners' abilities revolve around using fire to clear out enemies, and Phantoms provide protection with a variety of shields. DedSec is from Watch Dogs, which looks to provide hacking and deception, but the faction was unavailable at the time of playing.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xdefiant-delivers-the-cod-experience-many-have-been-asking-for/1100-6513453/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Dead Island 2 - How To Get Security Guard's Safe Key

<p>The early hours of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dead-island-2/">Dead Island 2</a> will quickly soon reveal a fact of its semi-open world: Locked safes and doors are everywhere. Many times, the keys you need to open these areas or items aren't to be found until you're actively on missions directly related to them but sometimes you can get crafty, either by finding an alternate point of entry or wading through an early challenge for the key you need. The <strong>Security Guard's Safe Key</strong> is one such example. You can, in theory, get it as soon as you arrive at the Halperin Hotel, but it's going to take a bit of grit. Here's what to do.</p><h2>Dead Island 2 - Security Guard's Safe Key location</h2><p>While exploring the parking lot of the Halperin Hotel, a security kiosk can be entered and scavenged, except for the locked safe, which will take a special key to unlock. Thankfully, the key is reliably in the same spot until you finally grab it. Unfortunately, you're not <em>really</em> supposed to get it so soon--but you can.</p><p>Chasing down this safe key provides the game's first example of over-leveled enemies--an RPG trope. You'll find some enemies whose level next to their health bar is actually the image of a red skull instead of a level number. This means they are three or more levels stronger than you and it's usually in your interest to just go the other way. They can sometimes one-shot you.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-island-2-how-to-get-security-guards-safe-key/1100-6513366/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The Halperin Hotel is one of the locations that you'll visit in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dead-island-2/">Dead Island 2</a>. Upon entering it, you'll notice that there are several locked safes at the front desk. Naturally, you'll want to open them for some goodies. Here's our guide to help you get all Halperin Hotel safe deposit keys in Dead Island 2.</p><h2>Where to find all Halperin Hotel safe deposit keys in Dead Island 2</h2><p>The entrance to the Halperin Hotel is just past the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-island-2-how-to-get-security-guards-safe-key/1100-6513366/">Security Guard's lockbox</a> in the gatehouse. After clearing a few zombies, you'll see the front desk to your right, with five containers that can be opened. You should be able to find all the necessary keys in one go, but, if some aren't appearing yet, you might need to complete the main quest in the area and return a bit later.

<p>Curveballs in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dead-island-2/">Dead Island 2</a> are basically throwable items.

You may then swap and throw them by pressing the corresponding buttons/keybinds (i.e. "T" and "Q" respectively on PC or the D-pad on controller). Likewise, some Skill Cards in the game offer synergies when it comes to Curveball usage, such as boosting your damage after you toss an item. Feel free to mix and match accordingly.</p><p>In any case, we've listed all Dead Island 2 Curveball locations below.

<p>In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dead-island-2/">Dead Island 2</a>, you'll often come across locked rooms or safes that can seem so teasing. You'll assume--or even see--sought-after items inside of them, but without the keys, all you can do is window-shop. One of the earliest examples is in the Goat Pen house, a crash pad for a group of streamers, content creators, and internet pranksters. These long-lost zoomers left behind the <strong>Goat Pen Master Keys</strong> somewhere in their home, and with them, you'll be able to grab a new weapon blueprint on the other side of a locked door. Here's how to get the Goat Pen Master Keys as soon as possible.</p><h2>Dead Island 2 Goat Pen Master Keys location</h2><p>Oddly enough, the Goat Pen Master Keys are in the locked room that requires the keys to open it. You can't know that beforehand; you can only discover it once you figure out an alternate path into the room. There's actually more than one way to get into the room. Here we'll tell you the easiest way.</p><p>When you're in the back of the house littered with supercars, which is where you'll first find yourself when you come upon it while traveling through Bel-Air, head down the path marked on the screenshot below. This will put you on the second story of the elaborate home, overlooking a rooftop patio and more.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-island-2-how-to-get-the-goat-pen-master-keys/1100-6513361/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dead-island-2/">Dead Island 2</a> shines brightest in its melee combat, but you actually can use guns, too, if you know where to look. While you might spend your first moments looking for firearms in Dead Island 2, you should know it'll take a specific action before you can begin to find them as loot. Here's how to get guns in Dead Island 2.</p><h2>Dead Island 2 - when do you get guns</h2><p>Though we said in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/dead-island-2-review-eat-the-rich/2300-6461159/">Dead Island 2 review</a> that the game's gunplay is the only downside to an otherwise deep and inventive combat system, don't let that stop you from trying them yourself. You can find guns all over the semi-open world, but not a single gun will spawn until you reach a certain point in the story.</p><p>Without going into plot details, there's a main story mission called <strong>Justifiable Zombicide</strong> which you'll need to complete in order to get guns to spawn. In fact, you'll get your first gun during this mission. Afterward, guns will begin spawning as loot in chests and given to you as quest rewards at times.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-island-2-how-to-get-guns/1100-6513179/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>While exploring Beverly Hills in Dead Island 2, you'll come across a mission called <strong>The Clean and Snatch</strong>, your first of 15 total Lost &amp; Found quests. These tricky side missions operate sort of like scavenger hunts; you'll follow a series of clues to your ultimate destination, which normally ends up being either a locked weapon chest with a great weapon inside or a missing person (turned zombie) whose item drops will include mods or weapons. Whether you're a completionist or just looking for some prime loot, Lost &amp; Found quests are a good time, though their unclear clues make them tricky. Here we'll walk you through the game's first such quest.</p><h2>The Clean and Snatch mission - Dead Island 2</h2><p>You'll pick up this mission in the pool outside of Roxanne's crash pad for former rockstars. It's easy enough to get to once you've been to Beverly Hills, as it operates as the region's sole safehouse. You'll find a trader, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-island-2-how-to-fast-travel/1100-6513177/">fast travel</a> map, quest givers, and more inside. Head to the backyard and look for a note next to the locked chest sitting in the emptied-out pool. Inside this chest is your quest reward for The Clean and Snatch, but it's going to take a while for you to get it open.</p><p>Read the note you found and notice the words highlighted in red. In Lost &amp; Found quests, the red font is the key info you need--your lead on the next clue, basically. In this case, the red font illustrates that you need to search the pools of Beverly Hills. There are several shown on the map of the wealthy neighborhood, but it's three that are fairly nearby that you need to investigate. In the back of the pools marked in the map below, you'll find poolside notes that further lead you to your ultimate destination.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-island-2-the-clean-and-snatch-quest-guide/1100-6513196/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>About 75% of the way through the main story of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dead-island-2/">Dead Island 2</a>, you'll be tasked with finding Dr. Reed's lab during a mission called <strong>The Search For Truth</strong>. While we will refrain from going into story spoilers here as much as we can help it, it's likely you're reading this because you're stuck looking for the lab location. It's a bit tricky, as you only have a surveillance camera image to go by. Skip the wait and use our guide to find it easily.</p><h2>Dead Island 2 - Where is Dr. Reed's lab?</h2><p>Once you arrive in the Ocean Avenue zone of the game's dozen semi-open hubs, it's not long before you're tasked with finding Dr. Reed's lab. The game usually points you right to an objective, but in this case, you're given just a surveillance camera image of where the lab is and you're asked to track it down from there. You can see what looks like garage doors next to a news van, but Ocean Avenue is a big place. But don't fret. Use our map below to head directly to the secret lab entrance.</p><figure style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4126526-deadisland22023-04-1716-53-09.png"><img alt="Dr. Reed's lab is located in a dead end of the eastern side of the Ocean Avenue region." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4126526-deadisland22023-04-1716-53-09.png" /></a><figcaption>Dr. Reed's lab is located in a dead end of the eastern side of the Ocean Avenue region.</figcaption></figure><p>Once you get close, the quest marker will update and story dialogue will occur, confirming you're in the right place.

## The Best Weapons In Dead Island 2: Early Weapons, Legendary Weapons, And Best Guns

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4127612-co-op.png" /><br /><h3><p>In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dead-island-2/">Dead Island 2</a>, the game's greatest feat is thankfully also its most prevalent mechanic: combat, combat, combat. The weapons and their customization options run very deep, which is important since the enemies do too. The game introduces a ton of new enemies, but you'll be finding never-before-seen weapons and even weapon classes many hours into the game--I've played 30 hours and am still finding some new types. For this reason, it's important to know about the <strong>best Dead Island 2 weapons and mods</strong>.</p><p>From unique legendary weapons with one-of-a-kind names you can earn by completing certain quests to the best weapon platforms on which to apply your most devastating mods, the level of customization in Dead Island 2 makes for one of the best showings in the crowded zombie genre. There are so many weapons here that you'd be forgiven for overlooking some key aspects of how to effectively mod weapons or where to get the best ones. We've compiled a list of our favorites so far, so you can follow along and not miss out on the RPG's best zombie-slaying axes, hunting rifles, and so much more.</p><p>Before we jump into the full list, it's also worth noting how mods work. In full, the game has <strong>36 weapon mods and 43 weapon perks</strong>. Mods give weapons status effects, such as fire, bleed, and poison, whereas perks give weapons passive or activated skills, such as improving their overall damage, reload speed, or causing chain effects across multiple zombies. Mods and perks are found through exploration, bought from traders, or earned as quest or challenge rewards.</p><p>Mods also come in tiers on many occasions. For example, early in the game, you may have an Uncommon (green) Electricity Mod, which provides a slight electrifying ability to a weapon you mod it with. However, later in the game, you can find better versions (Rare, Superior, and Legendary) of this same mod. Most of the time, it's best to just apply the best version of any mod you have, though if you were strapped for crafting supplies, a lesser mod will also demand fewer materials. But, as mentioned in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/dead-island-2-best-weapons-and-mods-list/2900-4715/">Dead Island 2 tips</a>, you won't need to worry about running low on crafting materials very much.</p><p>With all of this introductory text out of the way, let's dive into the best weapons and mods in Dead Island 2. We'll be going over some of the game's best-available loot, but also some of the best early weapons, as well as some standalone mods you can apply as you see fit.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Best early melee weapons in Dead Island 2</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4127616-cleanandsnatch%281%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>All of the weapons shown after this section are middle- or late-game finds. You'll do well to equip them, but you won't even have the option until you're done or nearly done with the story. So for players looking for the advantage earlier in the game, we also wanted to highlight some of the game's best weapon platforms. From there you can customize them as you'd like.</p><p>Based on dozens of hours of collective play, we really recommend the <strong>firefighter's axe</strong>, the <strong>heavy wrench</strong>, and the <strong>machete</strong>. The axe and wrench both pack a punch that delivers huge single-blow damage to one zombie, or they can sweep a small horde out of your way in one go. The machete is a sharper and faster option for those who want to stay nimble. Like always, these weapons are merely platforms on which you can modify the zombie-slaying tool of your dreams. The only downside is most loot drops are randomized--you'll even find your co-op partners will get different loot than you, so we can't reliably point you toward these items. But when you come across them, they may be worth investing in.</p><p>There's also one early example of a weapon that's better than most you'll find around the same point in the story. For that, you'll want to complete <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-island-2-the-clean-and-snatch-quest-guide/1100-6513196/">The Clean And Snatch</a> Lost and Found quest, which you can start by picking up a note in the pool of Roxanne's house in Beverly Hills. For your efforts, you'll land the <strong>Electrified Officer's Sword</strong>, a Rare (blue) weapon that will be a step up from anything else you might find at that time, assuming you tackle the quest soon after you get to Beverly Hills.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Emma's Wrath</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4127663-deadisland22023-04-1910-04-59.png" /><br /><h3><p>You'll unlock this devastating sledgehammer as a reward for completing the last mission in the main story. It seems intended to be the first Legendary-tier item you can even unlock in the game, so don't worry if you're approaching the last mission and are still only picking up purples (Superior tier). Emma's Wrath is a unique item, hence its one-of-a-kind name. Unique items such as this cannot be sold or scrapped for parts, so you need not worry about accidentally getting rid of it. And if for some reason you misplace it, you'll find it in your Unclaimed Property tab in any weapons locker found within safehouses.</p><p>As for why it's one of the best, well just look at it. This devastating melee weapon is not only extremely effective as one of the game's room-clearing Bulldozer-class weapons; it also moonlights as a shotgun. You can prime its shotgun aspect by skull-stomping or countering any zombie, making the next hit you deliver come with a powerful shotty blast. Its Superior Melee Impactor Mod is fixed, as are two of its perks, but even then it leaves space for two more perks for you to choose, so you can customize one of the game's most powerful weapons to your liking.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Big Shot</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4127556-gambler%27sbigshot.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>This Legendary-tier revolver is unlike anything else in the game. One of its two fixed perks includes explosive rounds, and it fires not just one, but three at a time. This is an excellent option when you need to clear a path through a confined space, as the fireworks-like explosion will knock zombies down if it doesn't just explode them in the first place. Though it's called Big Shot, I call it my "GTFO" gun, as it's saved me from being swarmed a number of times.</p><p>Because it's orange in rarity, you can infer this doesn't drop until late in the game. You'll unlock it as a reward for completing the side mission "It's Not Your Fault."</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Party Starter</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4127568-partystarter.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The Party Starter is a legendary pair of brass knuckles, which you'll receive if you complete the "Drunk and Disorderly" Lost and Found quest. To get it, you'll want to check the first-floor bathroom of Ocean Avenue's Serling Hotel. Pick up the note from the zombie that's chowing down on someone, which will tell you about a group of dudes looking to party at the onset of the apocalypse. The clues will tell you of two locations in Venice Beach's boardwalk (Roses Tattoo Parlor and Gang Green weed dispensary). Then, you'll have to go to Santa Monica Pier, to a restaurant that's aptly named Pier Grill.</p><p>Grab the notes and kill the unique zombies in these locations. Eventually, you'll be able to open the trunk of a white SUV in Serling Hotel's parking lot, which happens to have this festive weapon.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Blood Rage</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4127595-deadisland22023-04-1716-52-56.png" /><br /><h3><p>The Blood Rage is a legendary dagger--and actually an Easter egg weapon that calls back to the earlier game--obtainable after you're done with the "Fool's Gold" Lost and Found quest. You can start this by heading to the Santa Monica Pier - Lifeguard HQ fast travel point. Drop down to the main facility, where you'll find a Crusher named Dante. After killing Dante, he'll drop a clue about a locker, which is just around the corner in the garage. From there, you'll need to visit two more locations in The Pier to gather notes:</p><ul><li>One is on a bench behind an ice cream shop near the Ferris Wheel.</li><li>The other is in an alleyway to the left of a yogurt shop in the boardwalk (along the northwestern portion of the map).</li></ul><p>After getting both, head to the small section off to the side of the Lifeguard HQ building and kill the zombies that will spawn. You'll be able to dig up the chest, which nets you this reward.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Bodycount</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4127597-bodycount%281%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Bodycount is a legendary auto rifle that can be yours once you complete the "[Redacted]" Lost and Found quest. You can start this by going to the quonset hut to your left upon entering the Venice Beach military base. Kill the zombie with a unique name, and you're given a note. It pertains to a cargo container on the beach, and subsequent notes also provide clues as to the other locations. We've marked the final location of the weapon in the image below, both in the world and on the map. Guns aren't great in Dead Island 2, so you may as well have one of the best ones.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Wildstyle</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4127614-deadisland22023-04-1910-04-17.png" /><br /><h3><p>Though it's just Superior (purple) in rarity, Wildstyle is my personal favorite weapon in the game. You can earn this special firefighter's axe for completing the side mission "Art of War" after you've unlocked The Metro zone for fast travel. In it, you'll search for a rumored abandoned weapons cache, and after taking down a huge horde and two tough bosses--seriously, play this one in co-op if you can-- you'll be rewarded with this awesome zombie-chopping device. </p><p>Not only is it really colorful and cool-looking, it has the abilities to match. Its special ability makes any zombie killed with it leave behind a large fire in their place, as though you've ignited one of the game's oil spills. Basically, killing the first zombie in a line of them will cause others behind them to become engulfed in flames. This is super effective not only when bottlenecking and clearing hordes, but it also saves on durability, as you'll often spend much less time actually hacking away at the undead. Sit back and enjoy the campfire.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Brutalizer</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4127664-deadisland22023-04-1910-05-55.png" /><br /><h3><p>The Brutalizer is one of my three favorite weapons in the game (alongside Wildstyle and Emma's Wrath). This heavily modified machete combines jagged metal edges in all directions in such a way that fighting with it feels like you're putting zombies through some sort of heavy machinery. It's gnarly and super effective. You can make it yours when you complete the five-part <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-island-2-body-art-oversized-arm-bones-chthonic-ichor-infected-spines-blade-arms-mutated-hearts/1100-6513226/">Body Art</a> questline, which begins in Beverly Hills.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The One</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4127665-deadisland22023-04-1910-05-19.png" /><br /><h3><p>This sword of legend is almost a fantasy object, as it's basically a movie prop that doesn't skimp on its sharp edge. If ever you wanted to cut up the undead in a style that would make Geralt of Rivia proud, you'll want to complete the side mission Beacon of Hope near the end of the game. We don't want to spoil where it begins, so just understand that you can start it once you make it to the game's final unlockable region.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Best gun class in Dead Island 2 - Hunting Rifle</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4127657-deadisland22023-04-1716-38-21.png" /><br /><h3><p>As we said in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dead-island-2/">Dead Island 2 review</a>, the guns are clunky and not nearly as enjoyable or reliable to use as melee weapons. However, they're still available in some abundance, at least once you know <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-island-2-how-to-get-guns/1100-6513179/">how to get guns in Dead Island 2</a> in the first place. With that in mind, we wanted to point you toward the best gun type in the game. The shotgun is underpowered, and the pistol is rather bland. Some others are better, but none are better than the hunting rifle. </p><p>This single-shot gun isn't great at horde management--use a melee weapon for that--but if you need to devastate a tough enemy or even a boss in short order, the hunting rifle's damage per hit is unrivaled. Make sure you keep a good one leveled up and modded and you'll have the game's best option when facing single enemies or small groups that you can manage from a distance. You can get a Superior (purple) hunting rifle for completing the side mission "Creature Comforts."</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Contagious Perk</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1632/16320660/4127615-deadisland22023-04-1716-46-05.png" /><br /><h3><p>Now for something a little different: How about a great weapon perk? The Contagious perk is one of our favorites, as it allows status effects to spread from the initial carrier to others. For example, if you pair it with a status effect such as fire or electricity and apply the effect to the zombie in front of you, it can spread to others without you having touched them. Zombies don't really practice social distancing and they're famously anti-vax, making them highly susceptible to this perk. To unlock it yourself, you need only to complete the Contagious challenge, which asks you to hit 100 zombies with heavy attacks (hold right trigger). With such a low bar to unlocking it, you can have one of the game's best perks really early on.</p></h3></p><br />

## Dead Island 2 - How To Get Fuses

<p>In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dead-island-2/">Dead Island 2</a>, it doesn't take long to explore the world before you find oyurself seriously in need of fuses. These handy electronic items act like keys of a sort, and will unlock big caches of weapons if you can find them and insert them where they go. Thankfully, finding fuses has a reliable and rather simple method--but only after you figure it out the first time. Like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-island-2-how-to-fast-travel/1100-6513177/">fast travel</a>, the game doesn't exactly explain fuses so clearly early on. Avoid wasting time by using our guide to Dead Island 2 fuses.</p><h2>Dead Island 2 - Where to find fuses</h2><p>Fuses are all that's standing between you and some of Dead Island 2's many locked doors, as you no doubt discovered already if you're reading this guide. To find fuses, visit any trader in the game. They're signified by a dollar sign on your compass and map and they're found in most safehouses throughout the game.</p><p>Fuses cost $1,500 no matter from whom you buy them, and you can only ever carry up to three. As far as we know, there's no way to raise your carrying capacity of fuses (or medkits, for that matter). Unlike many items, you can't craft fuses, either, so you'll want to stock up on them whenever you can afford them. Having a full loadout of three fuses as often as possible will help you open the many fuse doors around LA. While early on, $1,500 is a lot of money, by the midpoint of the story this is merely pocket change.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-island-2-how-to-get-fuses/1100-6513178/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Knowing how to fast travel in Dead Island 2 can shed hours off your total playtime, and though you might like a nice long game to jump into, you'd be better off spending that time by tackling the game's many missions and chasing loot rather than simply back-tracking. Though the game never quite telegraphs how to fast travel, we've already beaten it and can help you easily right here.</p><h2>Dead Island 2 fast travel</h2><p>Once you unlock your first few zones in the main story, you can fast travel easily by approaching any of the red Los Angeles maps you'll see inside safehouses. Below you can see a screenshot of one as an example, since the game never really makes this obvious. You kind of just stumble upon it eventually.</p><figure style="width: 3840px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4126524-deadisland22023-04-1716-41-56.png"><img alt="Some, but not all, safe zones have fast travel maps." src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4126524-deadisland22023-04-1716-41-56.png" /></a><figcaption>Some, but not all, safe zones have fast travel maps.</figcaption></figure><p>With fast travel, you can quickly move to any previously visited safehouse that also has a fast travel map inside of it. This means some zones will have more than one fast travel map, as some of the later areas like Venice Beach are actually quite big. Rather than treating the world of Hell-A like one long tunnel in which you'd need to backtrack by foot through zone after zone, you can efficiently warp to areas to chase collectibles, complete side missions, or maybe go searching for more of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/dead-island-2-best-weapons-mods-and-perks/2900-4715/">Dead Island 2's best weapons</a>.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-island-2-how-to-fast-travel/1100-6513177/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Dead Island 2 Tips For Combat, Crafting, And Exploring

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dead-island-2/">Dead Island 2 </a>has arrived, and that by itself is something that didn't always seem likely. After more than a decade in development within at least four studios, Dambuster is the team to finally get it to the finish line. Now that it's here, take our Dead Island 2 tips and tricks with you on your adventure through "Hell-A" so you can stay upright and out of the jaws of the many undead roaming the beach boardwalks, Hollywood hills, and elsewhere across Los Angeles. We've already put dozens of hours into the game to learn these helpful hints, so you can benefit from our experience on day one. Here are 19 tips for Dead Island 2.</p><h2>Exploration tips</h2><h3>Invest in fuses early and often</h3><p>The importance of fuses isn't exactly stated early on, but take it from us: Carry them whenever you can. You can stock up on as many as three at a time. They're used to unlock optional caches full of weapons, crafting materials, and cash. They're also usually booby-trapped, so once you get them open with a fuse, check for tripwires and use zombies to set them off for you. Here's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-island-2-how-to-get-fuses/1100-6513178/"><strong>where to find fuses in Dead Island 2</strong></a>.</p><h3>Don't get distracted by locked doors--they usually require backtracking</h3><p>Other than doors requiring fuses, which are clearly marked on your compass and map, many doors you'll encounter will be locked when you first come across them. Whether they say they open with a specific key or that they open from the other side, it's worth looking into a little, but not for too long. A lot of doors (and chests) like these require quest items that you can't find unless you're actively on the related quest. There are a lot of backtracking and light Metroidvania elements in Dead Island 2, so don't fret about a locked door you have to walk away from. It's likely you're meant to come back to it later.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-island-2-tips-for-combat-crafting-and-exploring/1100-6513142/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr"><em>God of War is celebrating its five-year anniversary today, April 20, 2023. Below, we take a look at how the relatively recent release has had echoes of influence across the AAA development landscape.</em></p><p dir="ltr">As a highly successful reboot of a legendary (though dated) trilogy, God of War 2018 garnered not only ecstatic reviews from critics, but also 23 million in sales by the end of 2022. However, while many great games come and go, this one achieved something that few others do--it's become a major blueprint that AAA developers look to follow in their own projects.</p><p dir="ltr">God of War 2018's influence is most evident in a number of elements that have become staples of the contemporary single-player AAA landscape, such as colored loot systems in action games, Souls-inspired combat, an extravagant presentation, and map design that bridges the gap between linear and open-world. Some noted developers have called out the game as a major milestone that they hope to reach, including Final Fantasy XVI director Hiroshi Takai. In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-xvi-is-a-lot-like-god-of-war-and-its-director-knows-it/1100-6511847/">a recent interview</a> Takai even said that God of War is the game that XVI most resembles in terms of quest design, which surely will surprise some fans.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-god-of-war-2018-became-the-new-blueprint-for-prestige-gaming/1100-6513433/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>It's an absolute Spider-Man homecoming of sorts on April 21 when Sam Raimi's original Spider-Man trilogy, along with Marc Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man, <a href="https://twitter.com/DisneyPlus/status/1649080792839237632">will be released on Disney+</a>. Spider-Man: Homecoming and Venom will be joining them next month on May 12.</p><div>          </div><p>This announcement comes as somewhat surprising as this was kept out of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-on-disney-plus-in-april-2023-the-mandalorian-season-3-finale-peter-pan-wendy/1100-6512430/">Disney+ April additions</a> posted last month. The Spider-Man movie collection is spread over different streaming services, mainly found at Prime Video and Netflix, so this is the first time they'll be collected in one place.</p><p>Much like the X-Men movies at Disney+, this collection will likely be part of the Marvel Legacy, making it easy to find. No word yet on whether The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Venom: Let There Be Carnage, or even Morbius will be added.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/six-spider-man-movies-are-finally-coming-to-disney-plus/1100-6513442/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-pga-tour/">EA Sports PGA Tour</a> has been updated with a number of welcome improvements, the biggest of which is the promised three-click swing system that harkens back to golf games of old.</p><p>The three-click system lets you click once to initiate a swing, click again at the top of the arc, and then once more at the bottom to complete the swing. Hitting the sweet spot is the goal to execute a good swing. To ensure fairness, some online events in EA Sports PGA Tour have rules about which swing types are supported. The standard swing system will stay in the game as an option.</p><p>EA Sports PGA Tour's swing system was criticized at launch for being laggy and inconsistent. According to EA Sports, it was always planning to add a three-click swing system after launch, and now it's finally here.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-pga-tour-update-adds-3-click-swing-system-and-tons-more-good-improvements/1100-6513432/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Battlefield 2042's Aiming System Undergoes Major Changes In Next Update

<p>DICE has announced a major change coming to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-2042/">Battlefield 2042</a> pertaining to aiming as part of a tweak that the developer believes will benefit players and the game in the long run. With the next update, the default setting for Uniform Soldier Aiming will be On as opposed to Off. This will cover both controller and keyboard-and-mouse settings.</p><p>But what is Uniform Solider Aiming? <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/dev-notes-uniform-soldier-aiming">According to DICE</a>, this is a behind-the-scenes system that calculates how much input is required to move your gun reticle across the screen no matter how the field of view changes. "It will always take the same amount of pixel distance on screen for a given physical movement of the mouse. This creates more consistency between non-zoom and zoom, as long as individual zoom aim sensitivity (e.g. 1.00x or 1.25x) has not been changed from the default," DICE said.</p><figure style="width: 835px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4127917-screenshot2023-04-20at11.29.18am.png"><img alt="Uniform Soldier Aiming comes to Battlefield 2042" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4127917-screenshot2023-04-20at11.29.18am.png" /></a><figcaption>Uniform Soldier Aiming comes to Battlefield 2042</figcaption></figure><p>DICE explained that it had Uniform Soldier Aiming set to "Off" in Battlefield 2042 because past Battlefield games had a slower aim rate while zoomed to help new players learn the ropes.

<p>For more than four years now, the Epic Games Store has regularly given away free games. Every Thursday at 8 AM PT / 11 AM ET, Epic offers at least one free PC game (sometimes two or three, though!). All you need to do to claim the free games is <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/id/register">create a free Epic account</a> and enable two-factor authentication to start snagging freebies. You have a week to add the freebies to your library before the new one(s) take their place. At this point, Epic has given away hundreds of free games, and there's no sign that the program will stop any time soon. We keep this article up to date weekly to highlight both the current free games and next week's offerings.</p><h2>Current free game at Epic</h2><figure style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4127892-beyondblue.jpg"><img alt="Beyond Blue" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1595/15950357/4127892-beyondblue.jpg" /></a><figcaption>Beyond Blue</figcaption></figure><p> </p><p>From now until <strong>April 27 at 8 AM PT / 11 AM ET</strong>, you can claim Beyond Blue and Never Alone. Never Alone is a moving puzzle-platformer set in Alaska that stars Nuna and her fox. If you like side-scrolling games, it's definitely worth checking out. Beyond Blue is an adventure game that tasks you with exploring the ocean. Though these games are different from a gameplay perspective, both of them have strong and thought-provoking narratives.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-weeks-2-free-games-at-epic-are-live-now/1100-6476419/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">If there's one thing that developer Pastagames would like to make abundantly clear, it's that it's making a game about kindness. KarmaZoo is a 2D co-operative platformer for two to 10 players and the result of seven years of development conceived as a counterpoint to the majority of other platformers.</p><p dir="ltr">In the world of KarmaZoo, players are rewarded for working together and sacrificing themselves for others, rather than for individual skill or precision. Players take the form of a blob-like soul that is able to inhabit a variety of avatars drawn from the animal kingdom and beyond. As well as a double jump, each avatar has their own special skill: Hedgehogs hunker down to line nearby walls with climbable spikes, Whales produce a water spout that acts as a platform, and Lanterns light up dark areas for other players.</p><figure style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4127582-karmazoo_01.jpg"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/43/434805/4127582-karmazoo_01.jpg" /></a></figure><figure><div class="image-gallery__label">Gallery</div>   <div class="image-gallery__list hide-scrollbar image-gallery__list--small">       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4127598-karmazoo_01.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 1" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4127598-karmazoo_01.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4127599-karmazoo_02.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 2" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4127599-karmazoo_02.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4127600-karmazoo_03.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 3" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4127600-karmazoo_03.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4127601-karmazoo_04.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 4" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4127601-karmazoo_04.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4127602-karmazoo_05.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 5" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4127602-karmazoo_05.jpg" />     </a>   </div>  </figure><p dir="ltr">Friendly cooperation with your fellow players is key to success: "The whole game was born in the Métro in Paris," game designer Nadim Haddad told me.

<p dir="ltr">Sony PlayStation has recently increased prices of many of its games on Steam in several countries. The increases range from 10% increases to doubling the asking price of high-profile games, a massive change that was apparently unannounced ahead of time.</p><p dir="ltr">As spotted by ResetEra user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-raised-prices-for-some-of-their-games-in-certain-regions-on-steam-china-argentina-canada-etc.710600/">Chairmanchuck</a>, the price increases affected high-profile games such as Marvel's Spider-Man, God of War, and Returnal. The countries affected include Argentina, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Japan, and South Korea, with the hikes varying considerably according to region. For example, Japan's prices changed from 5900 yen to 7590 yen, roughly a 30% increase. Canada's prices increased by roughly 15%, and China's by about 10%.</p><p dir="ltr">However, it's really Argentina that got the short end of the stick here, as the price of God of War more than doubled from 4,199 peso to 8,499 pesos, which is more than double the previous price. Other Sony games in that country have increased by double or roughly two-thirds.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-hikes-steam-game-prices-in-japan-canada-and-elsewhere/1100-6513428/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>After a brief delay, the world's largest rocket launched from Texas this morning in what is being described by SpaceX as a major moment for the advancement of rocketship technology.

<p dir="ltr">In certain parts of the world, zombie-slaying across apocalyptic Los Angeles in Dead Island 2 is already at your fingertips. But most of the world still has hours to go until the action-RPG releases.</p><p dir="ltr">Publisher Deep Silver has thus provided a graphic showcasing exactly when you can start playing Dead Island 2. Basically, it boils down to whenever the clock strikes midnight in your time zone. So when the calendar officially switches to April 21 in Cape Town, or London, or New York is when the zombie game becomes available to play on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><figure style="width: 1920px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1813/18138562/4127875-img_6873.jpg"><img alt="Dead Island 2 releases at midnight in each time zone" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1813/18138562/4127875-img_6873.jpg" /></a><figcaption>Dead Island 2 releases at midnight in each time zone</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr">This rollout may be a bit different from other game launches for US players. Sometimes, titles will go live at midnight ET for the entire country, meaning the West Coast will get access at 9 PM PT. But that's not the case with Dead Island 2.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-island-2-global-launch-times-revealed-already-available-in-new-zealand/1100-6513422/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## New Pokemon Scarlet And Violet Patch Doesn't Fix Performance, But It Does Go After Bugs

<p>A new update is available for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, and while it does address several bugs in the game--don't worry Heracross, you're safe--there aren't any performance fixes listed in the patch notes. Technical performance in the new Pokemon games has<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/for-some-pokemon-fans-scarlet-and-violet-are-the-latest-in-a-string-of-disappointments/1100-6509446/"> been underwhelming</a>--especially when compared to previous entries in the series--and while there have been previous patches, these have mostly focused on fixing specific gameplay bugs.</p><p><a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/60277/~/how-to-update-pok%C3%A9mon-scarlet-and-pok%C3%A9mon-violet">For the 1.3.0 update</a>, players who caught an Egg instead of Walking Wake or Iron Leaves in a Tera Raid battle before they updated to version 1.2.0 will now be able to catch these Paradox Pokemon when they return. This bug had initially prevented players from catching either of these Pokemon after the challenging <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-scarlet-and-violets-next-tera-raid-has-a-ghostly-typhlosion/1100-6513111/">Tera Raid</a> battle.</p><p>For Friendly Competitions in the Online Competitions section of the Battle Stadium, changes to the deadline for this event have been made, and several Link Battle fixes are also being added in the update. For battles, bugs related to Terastallized Zoroark are being addressed, and another bug linked to double battles and stat changes stacking has been squashed. Pokemon Go connectivity issues should also be sorted with this patch, as there was an issue that would cause the game to crash on the screen that's used to pair with a Pokemon Go account.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-patch-doesnt-fix-performance-but-it-does-go-after-bugs/1100-6513420/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Fall Damage Will No Longer Kill You In Destiny 2

<p dir="ltr">Destiny 2 update 7.0.5.0 arrived earlier this week, but the patch notes were missing a number of changes it implemented. Bungie has now confirmed a number of additional missing patch notes, the most notable one being that fall damage is no longer lethal to players.</p><p dir="ltr">In the revised patch notes for the update, Bungie shared that "fall damage is now nonlethal to players," noting that "only collision damage was nonlethal." While some players have wanted fall damage to be removed entirely, making it nonlethal is a welcome change, as it will at least mean being able to survive a big fall without relying on their jump ability. Bungie shared that this change would be coming with the Lightfall expansion <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fall-damage-will-no-longer-be-lethal-in-destiny-2/1100-6511356/">back in February</a>, noting that collisions "will generally leave you at least 1HP instead of outright splattering you." As of this latest update, fall damage will also no longer kill you.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie outlined the other patch notes it didn't include when they were first released in a <a href="https://twitter.com/Destiny2Team/status/1648783919029026818?s=20">Twitter thread</a>. When Ashes to Assets and Hands On mods were equipped at the same time, players would get Super energy from both mods after killing an enemy with a grapple melee. But this recent update has made it so that they only get Super energy from one of the mods, something that's been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/12sjx8s/bungie_now_that_you_nerfed_grapple_hunters_into/">a bit contentious amongst players</a>. Similarly, when Firepower and Heavy Handed are equipped, players will only spawn one Orb of Power instead of two when killing an enemy with a grapple melee.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fall-damage-will-no-longer-kill-you-in-destiny-2/1100-6513419/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Destiny 2 Gets More Accessibility Improvements In Season Of The Deep

<p>Bungie has outlined new accessibility features coming to Destiny 2, with most of these tweaks to the game focusing on reticle changes, full auto melee, new subtitle color options, and more. Season of the Deep will see an "Enemy Targeted Reticle Color" setting added, that is designed to complement the current Reticle Color setting. This will allow players to select the hue of their hip-fire reticle that they see when aiming at an enemy, which is particularly helpful for players with color blindness.</p><p>"When this new Enemy Targeted Reticle Color setting goes live, most players won't notice a difference as the default value is the same red color that they are used to," <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/destiny-2-accessibility-set">Bungie explained</a>. "Because players now have a much wider range of colors to apply to the targeted reticle color, we have removed the color applied by changing colorblind settings."</p><p>Season 19 saw a Full Auto setting introduced, and Bungie is tweaking this option so that it now reads as Full Auto Firing. This setting allows almost all weapons to continue firing as long as the trigger or fire button is held, and next season will see a Full Auto Melee setting added. This setting will constantly repeat the melee attack whenever it's available and for as long as the melee or fire button is held down, and applies to swords, glaives, powered melee, unpowered melee attacks, and melee attacks while in a roaming Super.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-gets-more-accessibility-improvements-in-season-of-the-deep/1100-6513418/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
