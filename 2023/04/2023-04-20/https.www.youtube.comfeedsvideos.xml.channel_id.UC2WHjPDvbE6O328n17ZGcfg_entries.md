Elon Musk just revealed his plan to create TruthGPT, a maximum truth seeking AI that tries to understand the nature of the universe, because he’s worried about OpenAI’s ChatGPT. But it appears Elon Musk just played himself, since he had a critical role in creating OpenAI back in 2016 as a non-profit, open-source AI research lab because he was concerned with the lack of concern Google had of the potentially devastating impacts AI could have on the world. But little did he know, after departing OpenAI in 2018, it would turn into the same beast he built it to fight against - a for-profit, closed-sourced entity, controlled by Microsoft. So he’s trying again, with TruthGPT.
