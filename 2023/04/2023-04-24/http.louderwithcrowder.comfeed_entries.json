Yet, we were still responsible for SHRINK, which was what they called money lost from stolen merchandise. This was in a bygone era when shoplifting was frowned upon, long before liberal voters elected liberal politicians with <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/stolen-goods-food-fight\" target=\"_blank\">liberal policies that have made stealing legal-ish</a>. So I understand this employee's frustration working an overnight at a convenience store.</p><p>Was booting an (alleged) shoplifter into the soda aisle an overreaction? I'm not one to judge.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">NIAGARA FALLS ACTION: this video footage is allegedly from the 7-Eleven at 29th and Pine Avenue on April 9th, 2022, around 2330 hours. The individual with the backpack was supposedly stealing merchandise from the store. This prompted the employee to aggressively kick the person. <a href=\"https://t.co/orFa3DAaqK\">pic.twitter.com/orFa3DAaqK</a><br />\u2014 Niagara Action (@NiagaraAction) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NiagaraAction/status/1517231800560586754?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 21, 2022</a></blockquote> </div><p>The standard viral video disclaimers apply. Allow for missing context. This only looks like shoplifting. Maybe the customer and the employee got into an argument about Florida's parental rights bill, and the clerk took things too far. Maybe they are independent pro wrestlers who were filming an angle for YouTube. 2022 is a wacky year. However, this was spliced together from security footage, so someone in the store thought it was shoplifting.</p><p>And shout out to whoever thought to give us multiple angles. Seeing the guy get yeeted into a refrigerator is what makes this quality content.</p><p>We can expect to see more videos like this. As shoplifting is on the rise and shoplifters are getting away consequence-free, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/san-francisco-walgreens\" target=\"_blank\">more and more Americans</a> are <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/target-shopliffter-california-fights-back\" target=\"_blank\">going to take matters into their own hands</a>. But proceed with caution. If you live in an area that values criminals, there's an above-average chance it's an area that comes down hard on citizens who follow the law.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

At no time was I ever given any indication that I would not be able to continue to do the work I have loved at the network. It is clear that there are some larger issues at play.

Crowder set up the segment by pointing out the new federal <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/systemic-racism-animals\" target=\"_blank\">housing</a> rule that will punish Americans who have lived their lives in a disciplined way .. The rule will require responsible Americans to pay higher mortgages to offset high-risk lenders. </p><p>Crowder then played a clip of Scott Bolden, the former chairman of the D.C. Democratic Party, explaining how this rule is essentially a penalty for good credit and a high down payment. He said he is refinancing two of his properties to avoid the penalty. </p><p>Crowder explained the rule will require buyers with a credit score of 680 or more to pay $40 more per month on a $400,000 loan, and the amount increases depending on the size of the loan. Americans who make down payments of 20% on their homes will pay the highest fees. The payments are used to subsidize higher-risk borrows through lower fees. </p><p>Gerald then took the reins in a new segment titled, \"Gerald Knows Things\". He explained this rule basically means higher fees. One of the things when you buy a house, Gerald said, is that your credit score matters, and the line is set at 630. From a financial perspective, 630 is not great. Though this new rule is at 680, Gerald said it is still a tax on the middle class. </p><p>Crowder pointed out that, what used to be requirements (a high down payment, a good credit score) are now penalties. Crowder and crew got through a lot more info on this segment, plus <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/aoc-tucker-carlson-show-notes\" target=\"_blank\">AOC's latest communist rant</a> about Tucker Carlson and Fox News.

Barkley said that all he wants is people to be honest with him, as opposed to trying to get clickbait. He also said, as an example, he doesn't want to just glaze over all the mass shootings that keep happening. He specifically mentioned a young Texas girl who was recently shot in her cheerleader uniform after her friend approached the wrong car. However, he then said that even though he's a \"pro-gun guy,\" it shouldn't be \"easy\" to get guns. Which sounds a <em>teensy</em> bit political. But we'll see.  </p><p>This announcement comes just as CNN is desperately in need of a ratings boost.

Using the word \"male\" -- in research about males competing against females -- is misgendering so his university yeeted the proposal.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">Who could have guessed in 2018 that one day this photo would define a generation? <a href=\"https://t.co/EzlSBktBn4\">pic.twitter.com/EzlSBktBn4</a><br />\u2014 Louder with Crowder Dot Com (@LWCnewswire) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LWCnewswire/status/1649370792503791616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 21, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>King\u2019s College London Professor John Armstrong <a href=\"https://thecritic.co.uk/edi-contra-science/\" target=\"_blank\">wanted to research the controversial topic</a>. He was ASKED TO by the UK Athlete\u2019s Commission. They were working on a policy about trans inclusion in sports, and had a crazy idea that the opinions and voices of athletes affected by the policy should be heard. Professor Armstrong did too.</p><p>King's College did not.</p><blockquote>I submitted a proposal for ethical review at Kings College London which stated that the aim of the research was \u201cto find the views of athletes and volunteers on the question of when males should be allowed to compete in the female category in athletics\u201d. The ethics committee rejected the proposal, on the grounds that using the terms \u201cmale\u201d and \u201cfemale\u201d in this sentence constituted \u201cmisgendering\u201d.</blockquote><p>The college didn't have a problem with the survey questions. Just if the word \"male\" or \"female\" was anywhere in the research, Research, on how athletes feels about people who were born males competing against people who were born females.<br /></p><p>I'm assuming the research would also include thoughts on people born females competing against people born males as well. But for some unknown reason, it isn't people born female dominating in male sports. <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/volleyball-player-north-carolina\" target=\"_blank\">Nor is it people born female giving people born male concussions</a>. Armstrong's research could have shed light on why this is.</p><p>The professor was told he had to speak to the university's Equality Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) team about, quote, \u201cwording used in the survey\u201d and as well as the \u201cpresentation of the research\u201d. </p><blockquote>Asking our EDI team for assistance seems unlikely to improve the quality of the research. Our EDI team is part of the university\u2019s human resources function and has no particular research expertise. Until recently, it was teaching in a course aimed at senior managers that sex was a spectrum from male to female with \u201cintersex\u201d somewhere in between.</blockquote><p>Odd that an elite university would hamper scientific research by having it micromanaged by a department that has no science or research background. It would be as if Big Tech companies allowed partisan non-profits to determine what is \"misinformation\" when discussing medical issues on Facebook, even though the non-profits have no scientific background themselves.</p><p>In America, the  House of Representatives passed the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act.
