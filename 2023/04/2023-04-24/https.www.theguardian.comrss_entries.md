<p>World may have reached ‘more dangerous threshold’ than during cold war, Sergei Lavrov says; Russia has switched to defensive positions everywhere apart from Bakhmut, Ukraine official says</p><p><strong>The world may have “reached the dangerous, possibly even more dangerous, threshold,” than it did during the cold war, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov told the UN security council</strong> at a meeting he chaired as part of Russia’s rotating presidency of the body. UN secretary-general Antonio Gutterres said the invasion of Ukraine was “causing massive suffering and devastation”.</p><p><strong>Russia has switched to defensive positions in all its areas of combat apart from Bakhmut, according to the Ukrainian head of intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov.</strong> In an interview <a href="https://www.rbc.ua/rus/news/kirilo-budanov-viyti-kordoni-1991-roku-tsilkom-1682282231.html">with RBC Ukraine</a>, he said: “The only places on the frontline where they are making attempts are in the city of Bakhmut, an attempt to cover the city of Avdiivka from the north, and localised fighting in the city of Marinka. Both in Avdiivka and Marinka the tactics are identical to those in Bakhmut – just an attempt to wipe the settlement off the face of the Earth.”</p><p><strong>UN secretary-general António Guterres has proposed to Russian president Vladimir Putin a “way forward aimed at the improvement, extension and expansion” of a deal allowing the safe Black Sea export of Ukrainian grain</strong>, which Moscow has threatened to terminate from 18 May. Russia’s defence ministry meanwhile accused Ukraine of attempting to attack its ships in the Black Sea, which it said was threatening prospects of extending the deal.</p><p><strong>A woman charged with killing a pro-war Russian military blogger using explosives has been denied bail by a Russian court.</strong> Darya Trepova, 26, is accused of killing Vladen Tatarsky, whose real name was Maxim Fomin, on 2 April. He was presented with a statuette containing a bomb while giving a talk at a cafe in St Petersburg.</p><p><strong>Ukrainian authorities say <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/24/russian-forces-forcibly-evacuating-civilians-kherson-ukraine">Russian forces are “forcibly evacuating”</a> civilians in the parts of the Kherson region that they still occupy</strong>, a day after it was claimed Ukrainian forces had established a bridgehead on the east bank of the Dnieper River. The claim cannot be verified, but it comes amid an apparent increase in Ukrainian military activity in the south of the country which some analysts have interpreted as a potential precursor to Kyiv’s long anticipated counter-offensive.</p><p><strong>Estonia’s prime minister Kaja Kallas voiced hope that EU membership talks with Kyiv could begin this year, during a visit to the Ukrainian city of Zhytomyr</strong>. “It will be a hard process and the requirements need to be fulfilled 100%,” she said, speaking alongside Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Estonia has been one of Ukraine’s largest donors per capita and this was Kallas’s first visit after her party won a landslide victory for her pro-Ukraine platform last month.</p><p><strong>Beijing has insisted <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/24/china-rows-back-after-envoy-denies-sovereignty-of-former-soviet-states">it respects the status</a> of the independent nations that emerged from the USSR after remarks by China’s ambassador to France questioning the sovereignty of former Soviet states sparked outrage in EU capitals</strong>. “The Chinese side respects the status of the member states as sovereign states after the collapse of the Soviet Union,” the foreign ministry’s spokesperson Mao Ning said, adding that on the issue of territorial sovereignty, Beijing’s position was consistent and clear.</p><p><strong>The EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, expressed confidence that the bloc would complete a plan within days to buy ammunition for Ukraine after Kyiv expressed frustration at wrangling among EU member states. </strong>“Yes, still there is some disagreement. But I am sure everybody will understand that we are in a situation of extreme urgency,” Borrell said.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/25/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-426-of-the-invasion">Continue reading...</a>

South Africa is not a regular series of I’m a Celebrity. There are only nine contestants, at least to begin with. There is no public vote.

All these factors remove a surprising amount of meat from its bones, leaving a skeletal version of the show behind.

## Arteta looks to Manchester City alumni to revive Arsenal’s title charge | Nick Ames

<p>Oleksandr Zinchenko and Gabriel Jesus return to their former club for a showdown they know they have to win</p><p>Only 11 months have passed since Oleksandr Zinchenko, a force of nature in those final weeks of Manchester City’s campaign, cut back for Rodri to equalise against Aston Villa and haul them to within one goal of the title. The player who retrieved the ball from Robin Olsen’s net and ferried it back towards halfway was Gabriel Jesus, not a scorer that day but far from redundant during the run-in. Jesus would have an indirect role in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/22/manchester-city-win-premier-league-title-aston-villa-match-report" title="">Ilkay Gündogan’s winner</a>, making a run in behind that forced Tyrone Mings into a loose touch.</p><p>These moments will live in City’s folklore for decades. They are snapshots, too, of exactly why Mikel Arteta was so intent upon bringing Zinchenko and Jesus to Arsenal at £75m for the two. Both players were winners, B-listers by City standards but not exactly reserves. They knew, as well as anyone, how to shift the dial; they had operated in a team that, in those moments where adversity or self-doubt crept in, almost unfailingly found the wherewithal to achieve greatness. On Wednesday, Arteta must hope they brought plenty of it with them. Zinchenko and Jesus can count themselves among the summer newcomers to Arsenal who have propelled them from also-rans to potential league winners.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/24/arteta-looks-to-manchester-city-alumni-to-revive-arsenals-title-charge">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Argentinian meets criteria required at Stamford Bridge and his Tottenham past should not be an obstacle to appointment</p><p>So, Chelsea need a big-name manager, an ultra-charismatic type who can look after the egos of superstar players and also develop the younger ones, offering encouragement to them. They need somebody without an inside-out knowledge of the Premier League, who knows London, too. And they need someone to reshape the squad, to trim the fat, who actively prefers to work with a streamlined first-team group.</p><p>It is really not difficult to see the attraction of Mauricio Pochettino, who is not the club’s new manager yet but is getting so close to the job that it feels appropriate to wonder what the future at Stamford Bridge would look like with him at its epicentre. Even to overlook the disclaimer that relates to how quickly things can change in football, how anything can happen – particularly at Chelsea under the charge of Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/24/mauricio-pochettino-a-manager-who-ticks-the-boxes-for-chelsea">Continue reading...</a>

## The Guardian view on Ofsted inspections: not fulfilling their purpose | Editorial

<p>There is little evidence that the current regime helps schools to improve – and plenty of evidence that a better system is needed</p><p>It is the one thing that every state headteacher fears. A single bad Ofsted grade has the power to condemn a school to failure. The recent death of the primary headteacher Ruth Perry, who took her own life while awaiting a report that downgraded her school from “outstanding” to “inadequate”, has reignited a debate about the watchdog’s purpose. It is widely loathed by the profession it scrutinises. Its punitive inspections have been cited as a factor in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/mar/24/punishing-ofsted-regime-driving-out-education-school-leaders" title="">high attrition rates</a>. Even its chief inspector, Amanda Spielman, in her first interview since Ms Perry’s death, admitted that a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/apr/23/ofsted-chief-amanda-spielman-admits-to-culture-of-fear-around-englands-school-inspections" title="">“culture of fear”</a> surrounds the current system.</p><p>In England, Ofsted’s purpose is ostensibly to raise the standards of education. Yet there is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272775703000815" title="">little evidence</a> that its inspections achieve this. The <a href="https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Ofsteds-inspection-of-schools.pdf" title="">National Audit Office</a> delivered a scathing verdict in 2018 that Ofsted “does not know whether its school inspections are having the intended impact”. Inspectors can lack experience in the age range or subject they are tasked with scrutinising. Since its creation almost 30 years ago, Ofsted has not published <a href="https://www.edsk.org/publications/requires-improvement" title="">any research</a> showing that its judgments accurately reflect the quality of education that schools provide. Uncertainty about the purpose of inspections is reflected in Ofsted’s changing framework, which has been overhauled <a href="https://schoolsweek.co.uk/book-review-support-not-surveillance-by-mary-bousted/" title="">five times</a> in the last nine years.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/24/the-guardian-view-on-ofsted-inspections-not-fulfilling-their-purpose">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Talismanic flanker talks about obstacles, advice and role models that have shaped him into one of Irish rugby’s biggest talents</p><p>“It was really, really frustrating,” Josh van der Flier says on a grey day in Dublin as, just briefly, his sparkling good cheer and disarming modesty give way to something more tangled. Van der Flier, the consistently excellent flanker in the red scrum cap for Ireland and Leinster, is World Rugby’s <a href="https://www.planetrugby.com/news/world-rugby-awards-josh-van-der-flier" title="">player of the year</a>. He was one of the standout performers in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/18/ireland-england-six-nations-rugby-union-match-report" title="">Ireland’s recent grand slam</a>, confirming their status as world No 1, and on Saturday he will try to help Leinster beat Toulouse in the semi-finals of the Champions Cup as they set about reclaiming their title as the best team in the northern hemisphere.</p><p>But just over two years ago, as he was often kept out of the Leinster and Ireland teams by Will Connors, a dejected Van der Flier felt he had hit an invisible wall. “I was thinking: ‘What more can I do? I’m working on everything and still trying to improve but it’s not quite happening.’ It was so frustrating because Will was actually playing brilliantly. But I also felt like I was playing really well. I remember at one stage he started the game and got man of the match. They rotated the [Leinster] team the next week and I got man of the match. But the following week they picked him to start and he played unbelievably.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/apr/24/irelands-josh-van-der-flier-the-next-goal-is-to-try-to-win-the-world-cup">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Yes, reform is necessary. But without increases in spending as well, Britain will continue to be the sick man of Europe</p><p>The UK is the sick man of Europe. Since 2010, improvements in healthy life expectancy have stalled, health inequalities have been increasing and health for people living in the most deprived areas has been getting worse. The country has been struggling with three big challenges: a decade of austerity, the Covid-19 pandemic and a cost-of-living crisis. Each of these has exposed a grim fact: Britain is an unhealthy place to be poor, even relatively poor.</p><p>A tottering NHS has not been the cause of these threats to health but, increasingly, it is not there when we need it. People have noticed. Satisfaction with the health service among the general population was at 34% in 1997. This picked up, reaching 70% in 2010 after Labour began its reforms and markedly increased funding. It has been downhill since, reaching a new low in <a href="https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/publications/public-satisfaction-nhs-and-social-care-2022">2022 with just 29% of people satisfied</a>.</p><p>Michael Marmot is professor of epidemiology at University College London, director of the UCL Institute of Health Equity and past president of the World Medical Association</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

<p>As universities wind down teaching for yet another round of exams, more and more prospective graduates are asking: why bother?</p><p>This week begins one of the worst deals offered by any British professional institution. Almost all universities are about to stop teaching students and subject them to pointless exams, mocks and quantification, before passing or failing them, then packing up and reassembling some months later in September. For an average price oftens of thousands of pounds a head (except in Scotland), most students will get virtually no teaching for a good proportion of their course. From any other service – medicine, law, accountancy – this would be regarded as a scam.</p><p>The tradition of scholars teaching academic subjects part-time while doubling as researchers is a relic of medieval monasticism. Oxbridge operates for just 24 weeks a year<strong> </strong>while many other universities operate two semesters. Staff and buildings may be otherwise employed, but students will sit idle, doing odd jobs or studying on their own. No one dares challenge this system. Whitehall inspectors never declare universities “failing” or “inadequate” as they do schools.</p><p>Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/24/young-people-british-student-universities-exams">Continue reading...</a>

## Artist Isaac Julien: ‘I didn’t know if I’d live on until the 90s. A lot of my friends didn’t’

<p>He rose to fame in the Thatcher era with his lyrical films about race, sex and politics. As he stages a major retrospective, the artist talks about Aids, migration, and Black Tory MPs</p><p>Isaac Julien’s canalside London studio was designed by David Adjaye at the same time the architect was working on his National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington DC; its library space, where we talk, is warm, luxurious and boat-like. Adjaye’s team has also designed Julien’s imminent career retrospective at Tate Britain, which will display the artist and film-maker’s exploration of migration, history, sexuality and culture through composite multiscreen installations that can make you feel as if you’re actually inside the work.</p><p>“We’ve made a radical intervention into the museum,” Julien promises, and I understand immediately what he means. His most famous works, the 1989 short film <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-britain/display/isaac-julien-looking-langston">Looking for Langston</a> and the 1991 feature <a href="https://www.isaacjulien.com/projects/young-soul-rebels/">Young Soul Rebels</a>, are both landmarks of the Black queer experience and youth culture. Looking for Langston was shown at the Barbican in 2020, and it was startling when Todd Terry’s 1988 acid house classic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kP3h8An4qXI">Can You Party?</a> thumped into the space at full volume – a spontaneous queer rave in response to a police raid. Wherever you were in the gallery, you would turn to see where the music was coming from; it was a provocative intervention in the summer of Black Lives Matter.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/24/artist-isaac-julien-tate-britain-what-freedom-is-to-me">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Wigmore Hall, London</strong><br />Perianes has the agility and stamina to take on Granados’s piece but his realisation of the epic piano work didn’t have enough colour or character</p><p>Today the singular details of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Enrique-Granados">Enrique Granados’s</a> tragic death in 1916 tend to be better known than his music. The composer drowned trying to save his wife when their ferry across the Channel was torpedoed by a German submarine as the couple were returning from the New York premiere of his opera Goyescas. The stage work had followed the success of Granados’s piano suite of the same name, which was inspired by the paintings and drawings of Goya, though only two of the six movements can be related to specific works.</p><p>Though the original Goyescas is one of the great monuments of late-Romantic piano music, the whole set is rarely included in recitals; it lasts almost 50 minutes and is extremely difficult to play. But a complete performance of the pieces did form the second half of <a href="https://www.javierperianes.com/">Javier Perianes’s</a> recital. He’s certainly a pianist with the agility, heft and stamina to tackle this daunting music, but not, on this evidence, the command of keyboard colour to bring it fully into focus. In the slower movements, one longed for more subtlety and nuance, even the occasional pianissimo rather than a constant mezzo forte, and a lighter touch, too, would have been welcome in El Fandango de Candil. In the final two pieces, especially El Amor y la Muerte, there was a sense that Perianes was at last projecting the music with the vividness it needs, but it was too little too late.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/24/javier-perianes-review-granados-goyescas-brahms-schumanns-wigmore-hall-london">Continue reading...</a>

## No more home makeovers! The horror show of renting in Britain finally comes to TV

<p>From being made homeless with a newborn to your ceiling caving in with damp, TV rarely shows the rage-inducing truth about renting – which is why series like Evicted and Help! My Home Is Disgusting are a breath of fresh air</p><p>At 34 years old, I’ve called at least 26 places home – most of these were privately rented. After the fallout from my parents’ divorce when I was a child, our single-parent family moved eight times until I left for university, not including some weeks spent in a family friend’s spare room while we waited for a council house. My mum went on to live in eight different properties. Home has always felt precarious, temporary, not ours. I still rent today, as does my mum. She retires this year and will never own her home again.</p><p>The one thing that has remained consistent while moving around is the TV set. It’s the first thing to unpack, offering escapism after a day of lugging boxes. But I have also always watched TV for “relatable content”. To see something of yourself on the screen is to feel seen in the world. However, I never saw a real reflection of our living situation on it while growing up.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/24/renting-britain-tv-evicted-help-my-home-is-disgusting">Continue reading...</a>

When he was working with Ken Kutaragi and the other architects of the original PlayStation, and later producing games from Crash Bandicoot and Gran Turismo alongside game development legends Mark Cerny and Kazunori Yamauchi, he freely admits that he could scarcely believe his luck. When I speak to him, on the eve of receiving Bafta’s prestigious fellowship award for his contribution to video games, he still seems endearingly surprised by his own success.</p><p>“The people who have received [this award] before are all creators! Amazing, talented, genius people! I don’t know how I fit in,” he says. (Previous recipients of the award include Shigeru Miyamoto and Hideo Kojima.) “But everybody says I deserve it, so I guess I deserve it.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/apr/24/shuhei-yoshida-playstation-video-games-sony-bafta-fellowship-award">Continue reading...</a>

There’s a lot to say about this decision, and plenty of time to say it – the election takes place on 5 November, 2024. But here’s one thing that can be said right now: Biden currently has no serious primary challengers, while <strong>Donald Trump</strong> is at this point <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/nbc-news-poll-nearly-70-gop-voters-stand-trump-indictment-investigatio-rcna80917">the far and away favorite</a> among Republicans.

## Endphase review – searing testimony to one of the last Nazi war crimes

<p>Exemplary Austrian documentary chronicles the massacre of more than 200 women, children and older men just days before the end of the second world war</p><p>With the far right on the up worldwide, it’s getting late in the day to exhume the lessons of the mid-20th century. There are few surviving Holocaust perpetrators and victims still living, but this exemplary Austrian documentary, an attempt to chronicle the massacre of Hungarian Jews in the Danube river community of Hofamt Priel, does its damnedest to track down and understand both sides before they are gone.</p><p>Director Hans Hochstöger grew up in Hofamt Priel, a rural farming village about 100km west of Vienna, which was annexed to the larger town of Persenbeug. It was from a construction site on the river here that, on the night of 2 May 1945, the SS marched more than 200 refugees a short way inland and murdered them; an atrocity all the more senseless because the Nazis surrendered days later. Their remains, shoved into a ditch, were moved to a Jewish cemetery in 1964. But the killing was wilfully ignored and never investigated, unlike similar “endphase” incidents nearby, and only half-heartedly acknowledged in the form of a forlorn roadside memorial.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/24/endphase-review-searing-testimony-to-one-of-the-last-nazi-war-crimes">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For most of us, the key to boosting sexual interest is to find what works your accelerator and what slams on the brakes. Could a new hormone treatment play a part in improving sex lives? Plus debunking the most common low libido myths</p><p>Peter had never felt particularly interested in sex. Although he’d had various opportunities throughout his adult life, he had always been surprised at how lacklustre his attitude to these sexual encounters was. Maybe he was tired, he’d drunk too much alcohol, or he was worried about his performance – whatever it was, it hadn’t been a major worry until he met his current partner four years ago.</p><p>“For her, that physical connection with men had always been a big thing,” he says. “I wasn’t interested in it to the same level, and this still creates issues in terms of what the other perceives should be the right amount.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/24/low-libido-five-ways-to-help">Continue reading...</a>

## Mass brawls and haunted guitar pedals: the high-speed hijinks of British thrash metal

<p>Unlike their American peers, British thrash metallers never hit the big time – but over 30 years on, their scene is thriving</p><p>‘It wasn’t an easy time in the UK, the 1980s,” says Damon Maddison, bassist with Brighton thrash metal band Hydra Vein. “There was a fair amount of anger about. The country had gone up in riots, not too many years before there was the miners’ strike, there was general strife happening everywhere. It was ripe for thrash metal.”</p><p>The high-octane subgenre tends to evoke beer-soaked denim, bloodied noses, tangled hair and Californian vocals – and Metallica, the most famous band from the US scene, remain as popular as ever with a UK No 1 album this week. But thousands of miles from the Bay Area, ex-punks and teenage metalheads from Nottingham to Bristol were making their own thrash mayhem in the mid- to late-80s, leaving Ghostbusters-themed lawsuits, police battles and haunted delay pedals in their wake.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/24/mass-brawls-and-possessed-guitar-pedals-the-high-speed-hijinks-of-british-thrash-metal">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Arsenal’s academy manager is proud of his former teammate who leads his Under-18s into the FA Youth Cup final against West Ham on Tuesday </p><p>When Mikel Arteta departed Arsenal in 2016, his playing days finished and a transformative apprenticeship in coaching with Pep Guardiola around the corner, he left a note for his chief executive. One extraordinary football mind was about to up sticks, for a few years at least, but another remained within reach. Arteta knew Arsenal could not afford to let Per Mertesacker slip away. “You can’t lose this guy,” he told Ivan Gazidis. “Just put him somewhere.”</p><p>Gazidis obliged. Two years later Mertesacker, once his centre-back career had wound down, became Arsenal’s academy manager; he had been offered the role at the beginning of his final season, smoothing the transition. He was known to be methodical, organised, cut out for the kind upstairs position that might not necessarily be gratified with immediate rewards.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/24/per-mertesacker-jack-wilshere-has-proved-me-wrong-arsenal-fa-youth-cup-final">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Research supports the benefits of ‘expressive writing’ – but what makes it so cathartic?</p><p>Like many anguished teens, I often felt that my best friend was my diary. I would enter my bedroom in a terrible mood, but as the sentences took shape on the page, whatever was troubling me no longer felt like quite as much of a catastrophe. I wasn’t able to extinguish every sadness, but often felt calmer, as if a physical pressure had lifted from my chest.</p><p>These moments always brought to mind a scene in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire in which the headteacher at Hogwarts, Albus Dumbledore, extracts upsetting memories with his magic wand and places them in a shallow bowl, called the “pensieve”, which allows him to view things more dispassionately. Writing, for me, provided the same relief.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/24/the-big-idea-can-writing-make-you-healthier">Continue reading...</a>

Playing against the possession-heavy and quick-moving Catalans is one of the trickiest tests in football. “You have to be in the tie. We’re in the tie,” said the Chelsea manager, Emma Hayes. She is right but Barcelona walked away the more content side. Yes, they did not capitalise on their dominance to a greater extent, but their play (and injuries to Millie Bright and Kadeisha Buchanan) forced Chelsea to change shape, to a back five. As the Barcelona midfielder Keira Walsh put it: “We always score a lot of goals at Camp Nou.” Chelsea have a near-impossible task in Spain but shaking players free of Barcelona’s press long enough for them to release Sam Kerr will be key to any hopes of a colossal upset. <strong>SW</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/apr/24/womens-champions-league-and-wsl-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action">Continue reading...</a>

## Love According to Dalva review – intense, raw study of girl abused by her father

<p>When her father is arrested, 12-year-old Dalva takes his side in shocking drama rooted in careful research</p><p>Made with painstaking care and sensitivity, this debut feature from Belgian film-maker Emmanuelle Nicot is about a child victim of grooming and rape who takes the side of her abuser; this is a 12-year-old girl called Dalva (Zelda Samson), whose father is arrested at the start. It’s an intense film about trauma and its devastating consequences. Nicot ignores the perpetrator to focus on the victim, a decision that makes this film just about bearable; I can’t think of another movie I was so reluctant to watch, but after it started I couldn’t look away.</p><p>Love According to Dalva opens with a police raid. “Jacques!” screams Dalva – not “Dad!” – as her father is bundled out of the house. Dalva is driven to a foster home for teenagers where she is furious, insisting that her sexual “relationship” with her father is perfectly natural; they love each other. The other kids laugh at her clothes, which are deeply disturbing: like a middle-aged woman circa 1987, she wears pearl earrings and lace-trimmed dress, her father’s twisted fantasy of a classy lady.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/24/love-according-to-dalva-review-intense-raw-study-of-girl-abused-by-her-father">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Butterhead lettuce leaves make an excellent wrap for cheese, crumbs, herbs and nuts, all poached in a tasty broth</p><p>If I had to make a bed from one vegetable, it would be butterhead <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jul/26/lettuce-salad-recipes-10-best">lettuce</a>. Its soft, velvety leaves and bouncy heart would make a good mattress, I think. And, if I had enough and they’d never seen a fridge, the largest leaves could provide a floppy cover. My green bed would not only be comfortable; it would also be useful: despite modern conclusions that the milky <a href="https://www.webmd.com/diet/what-is-wild-lettuce">lactucarium</a> that seeps from lettuce stems is not a sedative, I’m with ancient doctors and hopeful that eating my cover would send me to sleep.</p><p>The ancient <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/when-lettuce-was-a-sacred-sex-symbol-12271795/">Egyptians</a> – great cultivators of lettuce – saw it as sacred, though for different reasons. In Egyptian mythology, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Min-Egyptian-god">Min</a>, one of the earliest known Egyptian deities of rain, fertility, crops and male potency, and often represented by an ithyphallic figure, was often associated with lettuce. But it was not the butterhead from which I am going to make my bed, but rather a tall variety with a “straight vertical surge of growth and milky juice”, as Jane Grigson describes it. Yet research in <a href="https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/did-min-really-need-all-those-lettuces">2015, by Pauline Norris at the University of Manchester</a> about the association of Min with the lettuce plant, concludes that lettuce was offered to Min simply to ensure the fertility and regeneration of agriculture, rather than as an aphrodisiac to increase sexual desire. Even so, buying a cos at the corner shop is now forever changed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/apr/24/stuffed-lettuce-in-broth-en-brodo-recipe-rachel-roddy">Continue reading...</a>

We would shower it with love, and wrap a giant pink satin bow around its neck.

With 15 minutes left of the week’s filming, she was put in a harness and tasked with performing a major stunt. She remembers how worried everyone was on set that they wouldn’t get the shot in on time to enjoy a “stress-free weekend”. But, thankfully, Kansara executed the move flawlessly. “It was the best feeling ever – I could not believe I did it myself. Before they even yelled ‘CUT!’ I was already celebrating.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/24/interview-polite-society-priya-kansara-nida-manzoor-ritu-arya">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The fear of falling asleep can have many causes, from trauma to sleep apnea, and the effects are debilitating. But there are effective treatments</p><p>When Elizabeth Johnson tries to fall asleep, anxiety often takes over. After going to bed, she starts to relax, but feels as though she is losing control. “Instead of continuing,” she says, “I get a sense of panic, a shot of adrenaline and I’m fully awake again.” She is describing what it is like to have somniphobia – the fear of falling asleep. “Then I have to do the whole process of trying to sleep again, or give up for the night.”</p><p>Johnson, 38, from Kansas, has had trouble sleeping and staying asleep since she was seven. It started out as insomnia and a fear of not sleeping, progressing by 12 to a fear of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/sleep">sleep</a> itself. As a young child, she recalls, it was a case of, “When you get to a place where you can mentally fall asleep, you’re scared that it’s not going to happen this time. Or you’re scared that you’re going to have nightmares. And then, later, there was another layer of being afraid to fall asleep: because you’re no longer aware of what’s going on, so you’re not safe.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/24/somniphobia-fear-of-falling-asleep-causes-treatments">Continue reading...</a>

## Somerset Maugham: a wily playwright of light dramas and weighty morals

<p>A new revival of The Circle is a reminder of a dramatist who smuggled vital messages into broad crowdpleasers</p><p>Never trust what dramatists say about themselves. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/mar/21/noel-coward-playwright">Noël Coward</a> spent decades disclaiming he had any purpose beyond entertainment while giving us finger-wagging lectures. The case of Somerset Maugham is remarkably similar. He once wrote that “prose drama is one of the lesser arts, like wood-carving or dancing, but in so far as it is an art at all, its purpose is to afford delight. I do not think it can usefully concern itself with the welfare of humanity or the saving of civilisation.” Yet this is the man who in For Services Rendered, first seen in 1932 and since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/07/for-services-rendered-five-star-review-theatre-excellent-work-from-a-flawless-cast">much revived</a>, wrote a blistering attack on the ruinous aftermath of the first world war and the creation of a society unfit for heroes.</p><p>You could argue that play is a special case. I would suggest, however, that Maugham is a deeply deceptive dramatist. His plays look as if they are dated old crowdpleasers, yet often challenge conventional ideas. There is a prime example in The Circle, shortly to be revived at the Orange Tree with a cast headed by Jane Asher, Olivia Vinall, Clive Francis and Nicholas Le Prevost. On the surface, it may seem like a piece of pure escapism. It even has French windows before which a young hero enquires, “I say, what about this tennis?” Yet, without spoiling the fun for potential theatregoers, I would say the play is not only expertly constructed but morally unexpected. Showing what happens in old age to a pair of once-romantic lovers, it ends with a palpable message that is not easily predicted and that prompted boos at the 1921 premiere.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/apr/24/somerset-maugham-a-wily-playwright-of-light-dramas-and-weighty-morals">Continue reading...</a>

## The Artifice Girl review – talky AI sex-crime drama asks the big questions

<p>This debut feature dissects the ethical dilemmas that arise when an AI is used to entrap paedophiles, but it fails to translate its ideas into a cogent argument</p><p>Probing the ethical implications surrounding the use of AI, Franklin Ritch’s debut feature hinges on a high-concept premise: an entirely digital avatar of a young girl named Cherry (Tatum Matthews) is used as bait to trap paedophiles in online chatrooms. Without the signature spectacle of the sci-fi genre, The Artifice Girl is a markedly low-key and small-scale endeavour, steeped in philosophical musings that ultimately seem stagey rather than cinematic.</p><p>Divided into three chapters spanning decades, the film moves through a series of single locations. It starts in a police interrogation room where Ritch’s Gareth, Cherry’s creator, is questioned by Deena (Sinda Nichols) and Amos (David Girard), members of a taskforce combatting child sexual abuse. Once Gareth reveals Cherry is a virtual being, concerns arise as to whether she can meaningfully consent to interacting with men on a daily basis. As Cherry grows increasingly sentient, the same talking points are reiterated in the second section of the film, as Gareth advocates to transfer Cherry’s intelligence into a physical form.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/24/the-artifice-girl-review-talky-sci-fi-drama">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This well-aimed tale of a self-obsessed therapist and her angsty clients nails the neuroticism of the digital age and its snake-oil remedies</p><p>The three main characters in <em>Work-Life Balance</em>, Aisha Franz’s mordantly funny new graphic novel, are connected by one woman: a therapist called Dr Sharifi, whose eyes, in time-long comic book fashion, can never be seen behind her round, outsize spectacles. Dr Sharifi dresses a bit like the Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama (AKA the princess of polka dots), and wears her black hair in an outre top-knot, both of which suggest from the off that she might be more interested in the pose than in really listening to anyone’s problems – and yes, she is always watching the clock, cutting off her clients mid-sentence if necessary. But her obvious boredom at their various states of mind (“the therapy bundle your employer purchased is over,” she’ll tell them, reaching casually for her mobile) is only one side of the coin. Flip it over, and we find her real passion, which is emphatically herself – and oh, if only she had more time to spend with this most fascinating of patients!</p><p>Where does self-obsession begin? And where, exactly, does it take us? Franz, a German cartoonist and illustrator whose last book, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/10/shit-is-real-aisha-franz-graphic-novel">Shit Is Real</a>, </em>was an <em>LA Times</em> book prize finalist, has an expert eye for the neuroticism that is born of the digital age, and in this comic <em>(</em>translated from German by Nicholas Houde) she goes after the relentless optimisation and the untrammelled boastfulness it encourages in us. Who can possibly withstand the onslaught of these things? Who wouldn’t be taken over by exhaustion and envy? Certainly, none of her characters can do it, which is why they end up seeing Dr Sharifi.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/24/work-life-balance-by-aisha-franz-review-richly-comic-takedown-of-the-wellness-industry">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Manchester United need to improve to stop City in final, Spurs are proving Antonio Conte right and Arsenal are missing William Saliba</p><p>For many Wembley minutes and until Solly March’s tears, the credibility of Erik ten Hag’s regime was on a knife-edge. In recent weeks, a previously wide acceptance that Manchester United had finally found the right manager has loosened. Both Louis van Gaal and José Mourinho delivered fleeting spells of success. Both won trophies, too. Even Ole Gunnar Solskjær brought the smiles back for a while. Heavy defeats by Liverpool and Sevilla had hastened dark thoughts of a false dawn but now Ten Hag has the chance to augment United’s football heritage. By 3 June and the FA Cup final, Manchester City could be set fair for a treble to equal United’s in 1999, the club’s greatest ever achievement. To deny City and pull off such a heist, United will need far greater attacking potency than against Brighton, though the grit shown by lesser-starred names like Victor Lindelöf, Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Diogo Dalot and even Antony will also be welcome. <strong>John Brewin</strong></p><p><em>FA Cup semi-final report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/23/manchester-united-brighton-fa-cup-semi-final-match-report">Brighton 0-0 Manchester United (6-7 on pens)</a></em></p><p><em>FA Cup semi-final report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/22/manchester-city-sheffield-united-fa-cup-semi-final-match-report">Manchester City 3-0 Sheffield United</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/23/newcastle-tottenham-premier-league-match-report">Newcastle 6-1 Tottenham</a></em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/24/premier-league-fa-cup-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Turning your back is deemed treachery but the frayed chords of connection have snapped and this team make me feel nothing</p><p>Last year a poll found that British adults make, on average, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/brits-make-122-decisions-daily-27664696" title="">122 decisions every day</a>.

<p>Woke up late with a face resembling the pillow you just left? Never fear – here’s a guide to getting out of the door on time </p><p>Dawn breaks. You wake, hand flapping mechanically across the bedside table for your iPhone. The clock reads 8.18am and you realise, somewhere between reading <em>Goodnight Moon</em> and ladling potato skins into the food bin last night, you forgot to set your alarm and have to leave in 12 minutes. No matter. As both a parent and a person who aims to look vaguely passable, here’s how I regularly get ready in 10:</p><p>• If you just got up, you will look like you just got up, so you need to de-crease your face – in every sense. The fastest way to do this is ice. I have a John Lewis basin in the kitchen which I fill with ice cubes and water and I simply plunge my face into it and hold my breath until my face starts to hurt or I start to panic. Remove, and pat softly with a muslin cloth.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/apr/24/how-to-get-ready-to-go-in-just-10-minutes">Continue reading...</a>

## Kara Walker’s breakup was in a museum – so I went home and started writing my memoir

<p>The point of reading a book, seeing an art show or listening to an album is to be absorbed – but this can also be bewildering and, at times, dangerous</p><p>Like many writers, I struggle to manage accounting. The only inventory that comes naturally to me is writing books, this interior work of zero use to the local council. I was young when I learned how alarmed one should feel by the arrival of bills, any letter without a handwritten address experienced as body shock. But through<strong> </strong>my parents I learned that female artists can process these sorts of anxieties through their work. My dad took me, as a kid, to see Tracey Emin at the Tate. My mum accompanied me to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/feb/06/alice-neel-hot-off-the-griddle-portraits-exhibition">Alice Neel</a>, Louise Bourgeois and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/sophie-calle">Sophie Calle</a>.</p><p>A decade ago, at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles, I went alone to see <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/sep/23/kara-walker-turbine-hall-tate-modern-racially-charged">Kara Walker</a>’s My Complement, My Enemy, My Oppressor, My Love. I sat on the leather bench reading her righteously wounded break-up letter, and sobbed. Because it was on the wall. So it must mean something. I didn’t mean anything in the world yet and I didn’t mean anything any more to the person<strong> </strong>I’d loved. But her devastation was in a museum, <em>framed</em>. And that was a big piece of getting me through. Art can do that. You can ride its coat-tails until you find your feet. I went home and started writing my memoir <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jan/31/your-voice-my-head-emma-forrest-review">Your Voice In My Head</a>, a call and response – even if she never reads it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/24/kara-walkers-breakup-was-in-a-museum-so-i-went-home-and-started-writing-my-memoir">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A doppelganger leads the way to suppressed secrets in the author’s wistful, fabular new novel</p><p>A young woman in an Athens flea market sees a stranger buy two mechanical horses, which dance when their tails are pulled up. Both women are wearing the same coat, a green trench, tightly belted. The watcher, too, covets the horses. As she greedily observes the transaction, she is compelled by the sense that she is looking at herself, “that she and I were the same person. She was me and I was her.”</p><p>From <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/fyodordostoevsky">Dostoevsky</a> to Hitchcock’s <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jul/12/vertigo-review-alfred-hitchcock-james-stewart-kim-novak">Vertigo</a></em>, the doppelganger is among the delights of literature and film alike. In The Jolly Corner by Henry James, a man nightly stalks an empty house, certain it is inhabited by a ghastly version of himself, the person he would have become if he hadn’t escaped New York. Long before Freud began talking about repressed memories and unacknowledged impulses, the doppelganger was a way of understanding a divided self, in which certain vital parts have been disallowed or smothered at birth. It can represent evil impulses or unwanted memories, long buried and rapping for attention.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/24/august-blue-by-deborah-levy-review-double-trouble-in-greece">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Heartfelt study of their remarkable accomplishments having fled persecution in their home countries and found refuge in the UK</p><p>Having fled systemic discrimination and persecution in their home countries, Roma migrants from central Europe thought they had reached a safe haven in the UK – only to find their futures rendered uncertain by the dual upheavals of Brexit and Covid. Shot during this turbulent period, Mira Erdevicki’s heartfelt documentary paints a powerful picture of collective solidarity in the face of unprecedented calamity.</p><p>Foregrounding the fostering of a supportive environment for an ethnic diaspora, the film follows three Roma settlers who tirelessly work to help create a sense of community among the displaced. Denisa was the first in her family to obtain a mainstream education, as Roma children in the Czech Republic, where she originally came from, are routinely sent to special needs schools. First working as a cleaner in the UK, Denisa became the first Roma British lawyer, which allowed her to aid other migrants to obtain the necessary documentation to remain in the UK. Victim of skinhead violence in the Czech Republic, Petr was awarded an MBE for his community outreach work as a police officer in Peterborough, while Ondrej thrived as a student at Babington academy in Leicester, inspiring him to study psychology in higher education.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/24/leaving-to-remain-review-roma-migrants-caught-in-the-brexit-and-covid-upheavals">Continue reading...</a>

<p>My partner and I – he is a first-time buyer – would use the property at weekends and for holiday lets</p><p><strong>Q</strong> My partner and I are buying a second home to use as a holiday home. He’s a first-time buyer but I’m not as I own the flat that we currently live in. We are hoping to buy a flat at the Kent seaside to be used as a holiday home for ourselves – think Monday to Friday in London, then the weekends by the sea – and potentially rent it out as a furnished holiday let when we’re not using it. We’re not looking to have it as a big source of income but just to potentially offset some of the costs of having a second home. <br /><br />Where I’m having trouble is deciding what type of mortgage to get. Residential mortgages don’t allow even short-term lets and buy-to-lets don’t allow you to live there. For tax purposes, we would not be letting it often enough to meet the furnished holiday let requirements, so would that mean a holiday let mortgage is not suitable either?<br /><strong>ET</strong></p><p><strong>A</strong> No, it doesn’t mean that because a holiday let mortgage is exactly what you are looking for, according to <a href="https://www.unbiased.co.uk/">unbiased.co.uk</a>, which is the place to go to find an independent financial adviser. “If you want to buy a holiday home for yourself but also let it out when you are not using it, you need a holiday let mortgage,” the website says. Although growing in popularity, holiday let mortgages are still something of a niche product available from fewer than 20 mortgage lenders. As with most niche mortgages, it makes sense to get the help of a whole-of-market mortgage broker who knows the lenders that offer the kind of holiday let mortgage suitable for you.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/apr/24/buy-seaside-flat-second-home-mortgage-best">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Exporting churpi, herders’ smoked yak cheese, has transformed lives in remote Himalayan villages</p><p>On a cold, wet August morning in the windswept high pastures of the Nepalese Himalayas, a stream of herders bring fresh milk to a makeshift tent at an altitude of 4,200 metres. The bells of grazing yaks and <em>chauris</em> (a cross between male yaks and female cattle) echo across the silent valleys as men work under a tarpaulin measuring, boiling and separating milk into curds and whey.</p><p>The curds are strained in cloth bags and pressed under weights to remove as much whey as possible before being sent to the village below to be made into <em>churpi </em>(or <em>chhurpi</em>), a dried snack that has found an unlikely new lease of life, transforming pastoralists’ lives in Nepal in the process.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/apr/24/curd-instinct-traditional-nepali-churpi-snack-reborn-as-dog-chews-in-us">Continue reading...</a>

Because I feel like I understood her.” It was just that she originally didn’t have time. Then the pandemic hit.</p><p>At the start of our video call, her camera isn’t working. It doesn’t matter, I say: just tell me what you look like. “I don’t want to do that,” she says, drily. Then her face appears: as camera-ready and photogenic at 55 as it was in the mid-80s when her career took off, but also relaxed, thoughtful, bespectacled. She looks like a film star playing an academic who was in the middle of reading something more interesting, but is patient enough to break off to talk to me for a bit.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/24/i-was-projected-as-the-sweet-american-girl-next-door-it-wasnt-me-molly-ringwald-bites-back">Continue reading...</a>
