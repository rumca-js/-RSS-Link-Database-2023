The latest DLC, The Burning Shores, and the PSVR2-exclusive Call of the Mountain, may have just come out, but Guerrilla mentioned something about the next Aloy adventure. Sneaky confirmation? Let us know your thoughts in the comments. In Diablo news, Diablo IV is getting one last beta test. It'll be free and open to the public, but be prepared for long queues, as this beta is going to stress test the game's servers. Completely unrelated, the International Red Cross Society wants gamers to follow the Geneva Conventions. They are challenging players of popular shooters to try and follow the established Rules of War, and a few streamers are rising to the occasion. And speaking of shooters, the new Call of Duty has been announced...but it's not a video game. What is it?

Jalmari Helander proves that killing Nazis never goes out of style \u2013 as long as you're willing to hit as hard as Sisu. Actor Jorma Tommila rages against a hateful German machine as Aatami Korpi with a heroicness fit for fable-like boogyman fantasies passed from one generation to the next. Helander keeps it simple and cranks the dial on intensity to produce an action-packed World War II epic that thrives on a smaller yet still decadent scale of destruction.
