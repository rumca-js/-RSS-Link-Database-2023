The trailer highlights different people solving problems in their own unique ways with the Ultrahand and Fuse abilities.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">For instance, one player creates a makeshift aircraft with the Ultrahand ability. This new feature was introduced last month in <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-showcases-weapon-durability-makeshift-weapons-in-new-trailer/1100-6512746/\">a Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom trailer that also showcased makeshift weapons with Fuse</a>. Basically, players can create all sorts of vehicles with Ultrahand, even motorboats.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Another player shows off the Fuse ability with some sort of addition to their shield while battling a Flame Gleeok at the Bridge of Hylia. This segment of the new trailer also confirms the original Legend of Zelda boss will appear in the game--and possibly in different elemental forms.

Titled Encore, the animated short introduces players to August \"Ballistic\" Brinkman, a former champion of the Thunderdome. The Thunderdome Games were a bloodsport held on Kings Canyon, and served as a precursor to the Apex Games. There is, however, one major difference between the two competitions: When a competitor died in the Thunderdome, they stayed dead.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">This is revealed to be a major reason why August eventually chose to retire--the new episode reveals that Brinkman's love for attention and in-game \"peacocking\" lead to the death of a member of his squad, and he swore the Games off for good. Well, almost for good. \"Encore\" depicts a possibly drunken, definitely depressed August watching an OTV newscast about his failed career, eventually smashing his drink into the television in a fit of rage. But things quickly change when the news story reveals that his son, Nathaniel, is now joining the games.</p><p>After suiting up in combat gear (and, evidently, getting a slick new haircut), August storms the facility where Syndicate leader and Silva Pharmaceuticals CEO Torres Silva is working, knocking out Syndicate security personnel left and right. Eventually, he drags a member of the security team into Silva's office, knocks him unconscious, and holds Torres (who goes by <a href=\"https://apexlegends.fandom.com/wiki/Torres_Silva\">\"Duardo\"</a>) at gunpoint. August tells Torres that they're going to make a deal: August will join the Apex Games--something sure to raise their television ratings--on the condition that Silva kicks Nathaniel out of the Games entirely. Silva agrees and, interestingly, refers to August as an \"old friend,\" suggesting the two have a history.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/newest-apex-legends-character-ballistic-revealed-in-stories-from-the-outlands-encore/1100-6513492/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/newest-apex-legends-character-ballistic-revealed-in-stories-from-the-outlands-encore/1100-6513492/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-04-24 14:17:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Hundreds Of PC Games Discounted Up To 80%", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Fanatical is holding <a href=\"https://www.fanatical.com/en/collections/indie-greats\">a sale on great indie games</a>, and there's a massive number of titles included.
