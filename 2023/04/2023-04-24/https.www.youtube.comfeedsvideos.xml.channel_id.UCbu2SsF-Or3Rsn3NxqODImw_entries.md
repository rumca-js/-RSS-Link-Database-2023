Your look. Your build. Your class.

In the latest Inside the Game Video, the team shared insight into one of the core pillars of Diablo IV’s design, Play You Way. Featuring General Manager Rod Fergusson, Game Director Joe Shely, Lead Class Designer Adam Jackson, and Lead Game Producer Melissa Corning, the team walked through the many ways you can customize your playstyle and character look. Player choice is infused into everything you can do in Diablo IV, from how you look to the skills you use to forge your path through the open world.

Select from five classes depending on the playstyle you prefer to begin your journey. The Barbarian is a close-range weapons master. The Sorcerer slays enemies from afar with powerful elemental magic. The Rogue is swift and can change between close and far range. The Druid can transform into powerful creatures and call nature magic. The Necromancer summons the dead to fight and deals in blood or bone magic.

Learn how you can play your way in #DiabloIV.

Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order packs a lot of story into its 15 hour campaign, and while we’re only really one game deep into the franchise, it’s still well worth taking a little refresher on the story. Whether you played the original back in 2019 and want a story recap, are keen to know where Jedi: Fallen Order slots into the canon timeline, or maybe you’re just jumping into Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, let’s break down the story so far.

In the above video, we break down and recap the full story from Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. The video goes through the story beats from the main campaign from the introduction of Cal Kestis to the climactic ending at the Fortress Inquisitorius. 

Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order takes place in the year 14 BBY, which, put simply, means 14 years Before the Battle of Yavin 4, the epic destruction of the Death Star seen in Star Wars: Episode 4 - A New Hope. It’s about 5 years since the chilling events of Episode 3 - Revenge of the Sith, and the execution of Order 66 - the galaxy wide purge of the Jedi.
