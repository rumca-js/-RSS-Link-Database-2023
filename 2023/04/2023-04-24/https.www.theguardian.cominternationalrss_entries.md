## Bottom-fondling audacity: how did Lavinia Fontana get away with it?

<p>Her nude paintings were unprecedented in the 1500s – and, as a new exhibition makes clear, this Renaissance artist could be every bit as outrageous and licentious as the boys</p><p>Arguably nothing in art embodies the male gaze more than the Renaissance nude, that genre of licentious painting in which the likes of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/titian">Titian</a> and Bronzino excelled. But an exhibition opening at the <a href="https://www.nationalgallery.ie/art-and-artists/exhibitions/upcoming-exhibitions/lavinia-fontana-trailblazer-rule-breaker">National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin next month</a> proves that a Renaissance woman took on the boys in this very genre – and did it just as outrageously.</p><p>Lavinia Fontana’s nudes were so unprecedented that experts argue about how she even got access to models. For a woman to be an artist in the 1500s was rare, for her to work with naked models unheard of. But, as Aoife Brady, curator of the Dublin exhibition, points out, she did have unique access to one subject – herself. The naked goddess Minerva looks out from Fontana’s 1613 work Minerva Dressing as if she were regarding herself in the mirror: it is the same look the artist gives the mirror in her clothed self-portraits.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/24/bottom-fondling-audacity-lavinia-fontana-nude">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There’s little evidence that it will lead to more Kiwis leaving, but there are still good reasons people see Australia as a place to get ahead</p><p>For a very long time, the concept of New Zealand and Australia as meaningfully different nations did not make much sense. The Tasman Sea was awash with two-way traffic in the 19th century, when we were outposts of the same empire, with ideas and people floating between the two countries freely. Australia’s 1900/01 constitution famously retains an option for New Zealand to join its federation of states. The two countries did not send proper diplomatic missions to each other’s capitals until 1943, and did not create separate “citizenships” until 1948.</p><p>In the decades since we have established ourselves as properly different countries, albeit ones that are extremely closely linked, with over half a million New Zealand citizens living in Australia. Over the weekend those links got even closer, as prime ministers Chris Hipkins and Anthony Albanese <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/21/new-zealanders-to-gain-faster-pathway-to-australian-citizenship-under-major-changes-to-immigration-rules">announced a huge change</a> to the way New Zealanders can get citizenship, which has been far more difficult since 2001.</p><p><em>Henry Cooke is a freelance journalist covering New Zealand politics</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2023/apr/24/new-zealand-shouldnt-be-afraid-of-brain-drain-after-australian-citizenship-deal">Continue reading...</a>
