Based on Wizards of the Coast\u2019s reaction, it\u2019s safe to say the video also irked the Hasbro-owned publisher.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"43f6c6f485084fb0a9c6b1b2e8859162\"></div><p>Over the weekend, Oldchoolmtg uploaded another video, this time titled <a href=\"https://youtu.be/bD9HRueI6Js\">\u201cThe Aftermath of The Aftermath\u2026 Everything is Gone!\u201d</a> In the clip, the YouTuber says Pinkerton agents showed up at his home on Saturday morning and began demanding he hand over the \u201cstolen\u201d product. \u201cI got up and recorded some videos,\u201d Oldschoolmtg states. \u201cRight after I got done with the video, dogs started barking because somebody is at the door. I come out and the wife\u2019s answering the door and it was the Pinkertons.\u201d</p><p>If you live in the US, the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-15-pinkerton-legal-fight-over-red-dead-redemption-2.html\">Pinkertons need no introduction</a>. The company is one of the country\u2019s oldest private security firms, with its original incarnation, the Pinkerton Detective Agency, dating back to 1850. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Pinkertons made a name for themselves with their anti-union operations, a job they <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/11/30/940196997/amazon-reportedly-has-pinkerton-agents-surveil-workers-who-try-to-form-unions\">continue to do in the 21st century</a>.</p><p>Oldschoolmtg speculates the person he bought the unreleased cards from likely didn\u2019t know they sent him an unreleased set. \u201cSomebody screwed up and sent out the wrong cases to the gentlemen that I bought the boxes off of, because when he sold me the stuff he said he was selling me March of the Machine collector\u2019s boxes \u2014 not Aftermath.\u201d</p><p>After recovering the leaked <em>Magic: The Gathering </em>set, including the empty boxes and wrappers, the Pinkertons put Oldschoolmtg in touch with a Wizards of the Coast representative, who was \u201cvery apologetic about making my wife cry first thing in the morning by sending these heavy-duty lawmen.\u201d</p><p>A Wizards of the Coast spokesperson confirmed to <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/23695923/mtg-aftermath-pinkerton-raid-leaked-cards\"><em>Polygon</em></a> and <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/mtg-aftermath-leaks-pinkertons-wotc-magic-the-gathering-1850368923\"><em>Kotaku</em></a> that the company sent the private security firm to Oldschoolmtg as \u201cpart of their investigation\u201d into the leak. The YouTuber says the contact they spoke to at Wizards of the Coast offered to send them free products as compensation for what had happened. For what it\u2019s worth, his YouTube viewership has also doubled since the original video went up.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/magic-the-gathering-publisher-wizards-of-the-coast-sent-the-pinkertons-after-a-leaker-200040402.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/magic-the-gathering-publisher-wizards-of-the-coast-sent-the-pinkertons-after-a-leaker-200040402.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-24 20:00:40+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Critter & Guitari\u2019s 5 Moons is a wonderfully wooden multitrack recorder", "description": "<p>Critter &amp; Guitari has made a name for itself by releasing <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-08-critter-and-guitari-organelle-music-computer-review-jack-of-all-trades.html\">quirky and highly musical gadgets</a>, like this <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-04-01-critter-and-guitari-eyesy-video-synthesizer-raspbery-pi.html\"><ins>video-based synthesizer</ins></a>, and now the company is back with a multitrack recorder that prioritizes simplicity and ease of use. The <a href=\"https://www.critterandguitari.com/blog/5-moons-is-here\">5 Moons </a>also continues the company\u2019s pristine record of making visually distinct devices, due to its attractive wood enclosure made entirely out of pine.&nbsp;</p><p>Underneath the hood you\u2019ll find a powerful 48KHz 16-bit sampler and enough storage for around 20 hours of samples and compositions, via an 8GB microSD card. As the name suggests, this is a five track device, but don\u2019t let that dissuade you from making complex compositions with dozens of instruments, as you can easily bounce everything down over and over again.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>This musical block of wood does not include a screen of any kind, so everything is handled via the sliders and accompanying buttons, but the interface seems easy to use, with dedicated buttons for most tasks like bouncing, looping and perusing sounds. The company says the 5 Moons is great for making simple enclosed loops and for composing long-form pieces. Looping is no great mystery, but creating longer works does require a certain level of expertise regarding various button and slider combinations.</p><div id=\"7100423c75084b70a5589f8b8303d99e\"></div><p>To that end, you can easily send projects to the DAW of your choice via a USB-C connection for finishing touches, and this connection also powers the device. Transfers go both ways, as you can send projects from your computer to the 5 Moons for additional processing, looping and creative tomfoolery. Critter &amp; Guitari says this feature is a great way to start a unique new track or to \u201cre-envision and remix\u201d prior tracks.</p><p>You can run external instruments directly into 5 Moons, like the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/critter-and-guitari-organelle-s-annoucement-183527954.html\"><ins>company\u2019s own Organelle S</ins></a>, thanks to a \u215b-inch monophonic input. The rear also includes a \u215b-inch monophonic output if you want to send the signal out for external processing or to speakers when playing live.

NetEase also alleges that the original contract was worded in such a way as to grant Blizzard \u201cunequal terms and conditions\u201d in favor of the publisher\u2019s \u201cunilateral rights,\" as reported and translated by <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/news/netease-files-lawsuit-against-blizzard-entertainment-seeking-43-5-million-in-332574\"><ins>MMO-focused gaming website Wowhead.</ins></a> A representative from Blizzard\u2019s parent company Activision told Engadget that it has yet to see any formal paperwork announcing the lawsuit and said that NetEase is \u201ccontractually responsible\u201d for refunds and anything else that falls under the \u201coperations\u201d umbrella.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>NetEase also alleges that it provided Blizzard with a large advance to make future titles. The Chinese developer says that not only were these titles never finished or released, but that Blizzard never returned any of the seed money. Again, Activision had no comment as it has not seen the suit.&nbsp;</p><p>Blizzard and NetEase were successful partners for the past 14 years before negotiations broke down to renew the long-term licensing agreement. This led to a complete cessation of all Blizzard games and services in the region, including popular properties like <em>World of Warcraft, Overwatch 2, Starcraft</em> and <em>Diablo III</em>, among others. Millions of Chinese players lost access to their accounts and related data. Some started fresh with new accounts in other regions, but most (112 million people) opted for a refund.</p><p>The agreement did not end amicably, with reports of NetEase staffers tearing down the Blizzard offices and <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/netease-smashes-up-world-of-warcraft-statue-after-its-nasty-breakup-with-blizzard/\">livestreaming the destruction</a> of a <em>World of Warcraft</em> statue.

Racing to make your flight is an experience nearly as old as commercial aviation itself \u2014 and one which has seen repeated solutions attempted throughout the years. Today, companies like <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-06-hyundai-and-uber-flying-taxi-concept.html\">Uber and Hyundai</a> or <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/united-and-archer-will-open-an-air-taxi-route-to-chicagos-ohare-airport-in-2025-191352804.html\">United Airlines and Archer</a> are working to get <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/we-wont-have-electric-airplanes-until-battery-tech-improves-160058357.html\">fleets of eVTOL aircraft to serve as short-hop air taxis</a>, ferrying travelers from city centers to airports while avoiding <a href=\"https://www.thedrive.com/news/chicago-commuters-once-had-an-easy-affordable-way-to-beat-traffic-helicopters\">the mess and hassle of ground-based traffic</a>. In the \u201860s, companies like Chicago Helicopter Airways (CHA) just used a bunch of repurposed US Navy helicopters whose rotors almost never catastrophically failed. Almost.</p><div id=\"3243051316d045d188ab59f4c6f7d523\"></div><p>Following WW2, the US government found itself with a massive surplus of military aircraft \u2014 we\u2019re talking North of 150,000 individual planes, helicopters and sundry whirlybirds that all needed somewhere to go that wasn\u2019t storage or a scrap yard. At the same time, an emergent middle class got the chicken in every pot and car in every driveway it was promised, along with all of the traffic and congestion that that particular American dream creates. So, in the early 1950s, the Federal government launched a series of grant programs to promote commuting via helicopter as an intra-city alternative to driving, simultaneously addressing both issues.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The CHA began its existence in post-war America 1948, as a regional mail delivery service operating in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_metropolitan_area\">greater Chicagoland</a> with a fleet of Sikorsky S-58C and H-34A Choctaw helicopters, but switched to carrying human passengers from 1956 to 1963. Its five-stop route moved between its home base in Winnetka, Illinois and O\u2019Hare and Midway airports, the now defunct Meigs Field, and Gary, Indiana.</p><p>For $5 in 1962 money (or just under $50 today) travelers could get from Winnetka at the North end of the city to Terminal 3 at O\u2019Hare, and do it in under ten minutes. Or for $11, sightseers could reserve space aboard a city-wide \u201cComplete Triangle Flight\u201d helicopter tour of Chicago. According to digitized pamphlets archived at <a href=\"https://www.timetableimages.com/ttimages/complete/cha62/cha62-1.jpg\">TimetableImages</a>, anyone flying to or from \u201cEurope, South or Central America, Alaska or across the Pacific,\u201d on Air France, BOAC Lufthansa, Mexicana, Northwest, PAA or TWA were entitled to a free helo-transfer between Midway and O\u2019Hare.</p><p>At its peak in 1960, CHA operated 126 flights and carried 6,000 passengers daily. However, that success did not last long past <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Helicopter_Airways_Flight_698\">the tragedy of Flight 698</a>. On July 20th, 1960, 11 passengers and two crew members took off from O\u2019Hare airport, headed for Midway under clear skies. Minutes into the journey, disaster struck when the main rotor failed and came apart. The crew attempted an emergency landing but were thwarted when the tail rotor subsequently broke off and the aircraft nose-dived into Forest Home Cemetery. It burst into flames, killing all 13 aboard.</p><p>Just three years later in 1963, CHA\u2019s business had dropped off by half with just 3,000 people opting for helicopter rides to the airport. By 1966, the federal government\u2019s grant programs had run their course and funding quickly dried up, effectively putting an end to CHA\u2019s operations. The company attempted a comeback with limited service in 1969 but shuttered again for good in 1974.&nbsp;</p><p>The CHA wasn't alone in its air commute aspirations. It was joined by similar services in Los Angeles, New York, Washington DC and the San Francisco Bay Area. European cities launched their own services as well including Paris, Brussels, Dooseldorf and between the UK's Gatwick and Heathrow airports.</p><p>Clearly the issue was that the aircraft of the day only had a measly single rotor to provide lift and placed it at risk of major mechanical failure. That\u2019s not an issue with modern VTOL (vertical takeoff and landing) aircraft, such as the six-rotor<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-10-bell-nexus-air-taxi-of-the-future-uber-2023.html\"> Bell Nexus</a>, which was to be used in <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/uber-has-sold-off-its-air-taxi-business-214902078.html\">Uber\u2019s now defunct air taxi service</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/volocopter-voloconnect-drone-taxi-first-flight-135531242.html\">similarly-specced offering from Volocopter</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-23-boeing-autonomous-flying-taxi-completes-flight.html\">the five-rotor version that Boeing tested in 2019</a>.</p><p>However, finding reliable funding remains a challenge \u2014 even Larry Page\u2019s pet VTOL project, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/kittyhawk-is-shutting-down-214542598.html\">Kitty Hawk</a>, ceased operations in 2022 \u2014 which has resulted in much of the technology\u2019s development concentrating amidst existing aerospace corporations. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-01-airbus-drone-taxi-first-test-flight.html\">Airbus is working on a VTOL</a> of its own, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/honda-announces-plans-avatar-style-remote-robot-and-electric-vtol-090002765.html\">as is Honda</a>, while <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/united-airlines-flying-taxi-eve-air-mobility-embrarer-162205301.html\">United announced plans to buy 500 units outright</a> from VTOL maker Eve Air Mobility to jumpstart its fleet. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nasa-joby-air-taxi-testing-200052607.html\">Joby Aviation</a>, which purchased Uber\u2019s air taxi business in 2020, just received <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/delta-joby-air-taxi-investment-133456152.html\">significant investment from Delta as well</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/chicago-helicopter-airways-taxi-airports-transportation-153747571.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/chicago-helicopter-airways-taxi-airports-transportation-153747571.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-24 15:37:47+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The best smart speakers for 2023", "description": "<p>Voice assistants are everywhere now \u2013 on your phone, in your TV, possibly even in your kitchen appliances. But one of the most common ways that people interact with Siri, Alexa and the Google Assistant is through a smart speaker, and there are now a wide variety of such devices available at a wide variety of price points. There are downsides to having a smart home device that\u2019s always listening for a wake word, as giving more personal information to Amazon, Apple and Google can be a questionable decision. That said, all these companies have made it easier to manage how your data is used \u2014 you can opt out of humans reviewing some of your voice queries, and it's also less complicated to manage and erase your history with various digital assistants, too.</p><p>The good news is that there's never been a better time to get a smart speaker, particularly if you're a music fan. For all their benefits, the original Amazon Echo and Google Home devices did not sound good. Sonos, on the other hand, made great sounding WiFi-connected speakers, but they lacked any voice-controlled smarts.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>That's all changed now. Sonos released its own voice assistant in 2022 and also supports Alexa on its latest speakers. Google and Amazon, meanwhile, made massive improvements in sound quality with recent speakers. Even lower-end models like the Echo Dot and Nest Mini sound much better than earlier iterations. With the growing popularity of these speakers, there are now more options than ever. Let\u2019s walk through our choices for the best smart speakers at different price points and for different uses.</p><h2>Picking an assistant</h2><p>The first thing most people should do is decide what voice assistant they want to use. Google Assistant and Amazon's Alexa are both well-supported options that are continually evolving, with new features added at a steady clip. A few years ago, Alexa worked with more smart home devices, but at this point, basically any smart device worth buying works with both.</p><p>It's mostly a matter of personal preference. If you already use Google Assistant on your Android phone, it makes sense to stick with that. But while Alexa isn\u2019t quite as good at answering general knowledge questions, it syncs just fine with things like calendars from your Google account. And it works with perhaps the widest variety of smart home devices, as well. If you\u2019ve never used <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amazon-alexa/id944011620\">Alexa</a> or <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.googleassistant&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US\">Google Assistant</a>, you can download their apps to your smart phone and spend some time testing them out before buying a speaker.</p><p>If you buy a Sonos device with a microphone, you can also use <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sonos-voice-control-assistant-for-music-200538441.html\">the company's own voice assistant</a>, voiced by Giancarlo Esposito. It's focused purely on music control, so you won't use it to do things like send messages or ask the weather forecast. But as a music assistant, Sonos Voice Control is generally quite fast and reliable.</p><p>As for Apple, you won\u2019t be surprised to learn the HomePod and HomePod mini are the only Siri-compatible speakers on the market.  Siri has a reputation for not being as smart as Alexa or Google Assistant, but it\u2019s totally capable of handling common voice queries like answering questions, controlling smart home devices, sending messages, making calls and playing music. Technically, Siri and Apple\u2019s HomeKit technology doesn\u2019t work with as many smart home devices as the competition, but it\u2019s not hard to find compatible gear. And Apple has most definitely improved Siri\u2019s capabilities over the last couple years, with handy features like and Intercom tool and routines that take advantage of the built-in temperature sensor in the HomePod and HomePod Mini.</p><h2>Best smart speaker under $50: Amazon Echo Dot</h2><p></p><p>Most people's entry point into the smart speaker world will not be an expensive device. Amazon's fourth-generation <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDlCOFYxTFozP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWQ2LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyMmUzZjBiNy1jMTc5LTM5MmEtODIxYy1lNmRmNTNjMjgwYTYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZXNEHk7FsGNE_XvtNGqcNRKg4X5smBOvwFOgWVpzaOU&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09B8V1LZ3%3F\">Echo Dot</a> and Google's <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3719d8d4-5edd-4817-998a-91f3229e7323&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Walmart&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzNzE5ZDhkNC01ZWRkLTQ4MTctOTk4YS05MWYzMjI5ZTczMjMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FsbWFydC5jb20vaXAvR29vZ2xlLU5lc3QtTWluaS0ybmQtR2VuZXJhdGlvbi1DaGFsay83NTE2MTIwMTIiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjIyZTNmMGI3LWMxNzktMzkyYS04MjFjLWU2ZGY1M2MyODBhNiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAWI09cTB1paP_8rNk0Y7QX-pWjYPXnnM13p5n65pcwPv&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Nest-Mini-2nd-Generation-Chalk%2F751612012\">Nest Mini</a> are the most obvious places to start for two important reasons. One, they're cheap: Both the Nest Mini and Echo Dost cost $50. Two, they're capable. Despite the low price, these speakers can do virtually the same things as larger and more expensive devices.</p><p>The Google Nest Mini was released in late 2019, but Amazon just refreshed the Echo Dot last year. The Echo Dot is the best small smart speaker for most people. Amazon keeps improving the audio quality across its Echo device line, and the Echo Dot is no exception. It produces much louder and clearer audio than I\u2019d expect from a $50 speaker. The Nest Mini doesn\u2019t sound bad, and it\u2019s perfectly fine for listening in the bedroom while getting ready for the day, but the Echo Dot is a better all-purpose music listening device.</p><p>From a design perspective, Amazon broke the mold with the latest Echo Dot. Instead of a small puck like the Nest Mini, the new Dot is shaped like a little globe. It\u2019s much bigger than the Nest Mini, but that size gives it room for higher-end audio components. The Dot keeps the handy physical volume buttons and mute switch on top, along with a button to activate Alexa's voice control. While the Dot doesn\u2019t look as sleek as the Nest Mini, having physical buttons makes it easier to adjust volume and mute the mic. I do wish the Dot had a way to physically pause music; on the Nest Mini, if you tap the middle of the device, the music stops.</p><p>Another benefit the Amazon Echo Dot has over the Google Nest Mini is its 3.5mm audio out jack, which means you can plug it into other speakers and instantly upgrade the audio quality. When you do that, you can ask Alexa to stream music, and it'll output to whatever speaker you have connected. That'll help you get more mileage out of the Dot in the long run. The Nest Mini answers with a handy wall mount, for people who want to keep their counter or shelf clear. The Echo Dot\u2019s new bulbous form is definitely not suited to this, so if you want a speaker you can really hide, the Nest Mini is probably the better choice.</p><p>Overall, the Dot is the best choice for most people, but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Nest Mini, either. I generally prefer using Google Assistant over Alexa, and anyone who feels the same should go ahead and get the Nest Mini. The Dot does sound notably better, so if you plan to listen to audio on a regular basis, that\u2019s probably the way to go. But if you only plan to use it for a quick song or podcast when you\u2019re getting ready in the morning, just pick your favorite assistant and go from there.</p><h2>Best smart speaker under $100: Amazon Echo</h2><p></p><p>Amazon, Apple and Google all have $100 smart speakers: the fourth-generation <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDg1SEs0S0w2P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWQ2LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyMmUzZjBiNy1jMTc5LTM5MmEtODIxYy1lNmRmNTNjMjgwYTYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAATdcQZxdYwTZKlKR3f8wqWL47-eHL5SKRgMmwrEYltFC&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB085HK4KL6%3F\">Echo</a>, the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3719d8d4-5edd-4817-998a-91f3229e7323&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Walmart&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzNzE5ZDhkNC01ZWRkLTQ4MTctOTk4YS05MWYzMjI5ZTczMjMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FsbWFydC5jb20vaXAvSG9tZVBvZC1taW5pLVNwYWNlLUdyYXkvODEwNzQ2OTYxIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyMmUzZjBiNy1jMTc5LTM5MmEtODIxYy1lNmRmNTNjMjgwYTYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAXA5tlqyG6X6C9ACOSTnyb27FaC-pkRyIPk1k08C52Vf&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FHomePod-mini-Space-Gray%2F810746961\">HomePod mini</a> and the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3719d8d4-5edd-4817-998a-91f3229e7323&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Walmart&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzNzE5ZDhkNC01ZWRkLTQ4MTctOTk4YS05MWYzMjI5ZTczMjMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FsbWFydC5jb20vaXAvR29vZ2xlLU5lc3QtQXVkaW8tU21hcnQtU3BlYWtlci13aXRoLUdvb2dsZS1Bc3Npc3RhbnQtQ2hhbGsvNzc4OTkwMzM5IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyMmUzZjBiNy1jMTc5LTM5MmEtODIxYy1lNmRmNTNjMjgwYTYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfTf66g1NcLyueHahQ7Wo_B-ftmspS_GfKNyJWMUNylN&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Nest-Audio-Smart-Speaker-with-Google-Assistant-Chalk%2F778990339\">Nest Audio</a>, respectively. All three companies claim superior audio quality, so for lots of people these speakers will be the sweet spot between small speakers like the Echo Dot and Nest Mini and bigger, more expensive models like the Sonos Era 100.</p><p>Once again, Amazon punches above its weight. Like the Dot, the latest Echo is totally redesigned and the new internals were made with music in mind. It combines a three-inch woofer with two 0.8-inch tweeters \u2014 a more advanced setup than either the Nest Audio or HomePod mini. (The Google Nest Audio uses a three-inch woofer but only a single 0.75-inch tweeter, while the Apple HomePod mini makes do with a single \u201cfull range\u201d driver and two passive radiators.)</p><p>In practice, this means the Echo is noticeably louder than either the Nest Audio or HomePod mini and much better suited to filling a large room than the competition. It also delivers an impressive bass thump and powerful mid-range frequencies. In fact, my main complaint with the speaker is that highs aren\u2019t quite crisp enough. Compare the Echo to a Era 100 and the 100 sounds much more lively, while the Echo comes off a bit muddy. Then again, the 100 costs more than twice as much as the Echo.</p><p>While the Echo may beat the Nest Audio and HomePod mini on volume and bass, Google and Apple\u2019s speakers are not bad options. The HomePod mini is the quietest of the three speakers, but it still sounds balanced across the entire audio spectrum. The bass isn\u2019t too assertive, but there\u2019s more presence than I would have expected given its tiny size (it\u2019s by far the smallest of these three speakers).</p><p>And it has a few nice perks if you\u2019re using an iPhone 11 or newer. Thanks to the U1 \u201cultra-wideband\u201d chip in recent iPhones, the HomePod mini can tell when there\u2019s a phone near it, which makes handing off music from your phone to the speaker (or vice versa) quite simple. Playback controls for the HomePod mini will automatically pop up as well, and your phone\u2019s lock screen will display music suggestions if the speaker isn\u2019t currently playing. Setup is also dead-simple \u2014 just bring an iPhone or iPad near the speaker and it\u2019ll automatically start the process.</p><p>Google\u2019s Nest Audio is also quite pleasant to listen to. It\u2019s a little louder than the HomePod mini, and has stronger bass, to boot. It doesn\u2019t have the same overall power and presence that the Echo does, but for $100 it\u2019s a well-balanced speaker that should serve most people\u2019s needs.</p><p>All three of these speakers support stereo pairing as well, if you want more volume or crave a more immersive experience. For $200, two Echoes will fill a large room with high-quality sound and enough bass to power a party. A pair of HomePod mini or Nest Audio speakers aren\u2019t quite as powerful, but it makes for a great upgrade if you\u2019re a more avid listener. A pair of Nest Audio or HomePod mini speakers sounded great on my desk during the workday. I don\u2019t need overwhelming volume but can appreciate the stereo separation. And two of those speakers together can easily power a larger living space, although the Echo is the better choice if volume is a priority.</p><p>Here too, I think that picking the assistant that works best in your house and with your other gadgets is probably the most important factor \u2014 but given Alexa\u2019s ubiquity and the new Echo\u2019s superior sound quality, it\u2019s the best smart speaker at this price point.</p><h2>Best midrange smart speaker: Sonos Era 100</h2><p></p><p>If you have more than a passing interest in music, the Echo Dot and Nest Mini aren't really going to cut it. Spending more money to upgrade to a speaker designed with audio quality in mind is one of the best decisions I've made. For years, I didn't have a proper home music solution, but in the end the modest investment has made my life much more pleasant.</p><p>For years, the Sonos One has been a favorite of mine, combining a reasonable price with good sound quality and a plethora of useful features like easy multi-room audio, stereo pairing and compatibility with tons of services. This year, Sonos replaced the One with the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1e71dc69-0ad7-47e7-abf5-dc3926557fa3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sonos&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIxZTcxZGM2OS0wYWQ3LTQ3ZTctYWJmNS1kYzM5MjY1NTdmYTMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc29ub3MuY29tL2VuLXVzL3Nob3AvZXJhLTEwMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMjJlM2YwYjctYzE3OS0zOTJhLTgyMWMtZTZkZjUzYzI4MGE2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAZ2QTRvlnA5n8O6YgARV32cka-FgDMGabeYoGRrBpYQW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fera-100\">Era 100</a>, a $250 speaker that is an improvement in almost every way you can think of. Most importantly, it uses a new speaker array that includes two tweeters instead of just one as well as a woofer that\u2019s 25 percent bigger. The end result is that the Era 100 handily bests the One in sound quality, with impressive bass, surprisingly huge volume and increased high-end clarity thanks to the additional tweeter.</p><p>There are a lot of other improvements beyond just sound quality. The Era 100 uses its built-in microphones for much easier Trueplay tuning, which optimizes the speaker\u2019s output based on where you place it. Previously, you had to use an iPhone and walk around the room waving the phone to optimize your Sonos speaker, but now the process is much simpler. The Era 100 also includes line-in via a USB-C port and also has Bluetooth for when you just want to quickly connect a device to the speaker. It\u2019s a bummer that you need to buy an adapter to hook up a turntable or other audio equipment to the Era 100, but since the One didn\u2019t support line-in at all, I\u2019m still glad it\u2019s an option.</p><p>There are a handful of other small but solid improvements, like redesigned controls on the top that make it easier to skip tracks and a mic mute switch that cuts the power to the mic for extra security. Like the One, you can set up Alexa or the Sonos voice assistant here, but the Era 100 <em>doesn\u2019t</em> support the Google Assistant \u2013 so if you were previously using a Sonos speaker and relied on Google, you\u2019re unfortunately out of luck here. Other than that one change, though, the Era 100 is an excellent all-around performer. It\u2019s a great speaker on its own and is also a great starting point if you want to build a multi-room audio setup.</p><p>Amazon\u2019s Echo Studio remains an excellent-sounding speaker as well, and at $199 it\u2019s a good bit cheaper than the Era 100 as well. If you want to save some cash or already have a bunch of other Echo devices, it makes sense as a speaker for higher-quality music playback. But given that it\u2019ll be four years old this fall, I think it makes sense to opt for a newer device that\u2019ll get longer support and updates.</p><h2>Best smart speaker for music lovers: Sonos Five</h2><p></p><p>As nice as the Era 100 and Echo Studio are, there's only so much you can get out of them. If you crave more bass, clarity and stereo separation, the $550 <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1e71dc69-0ad7-47e7-abf5-dc3926557fa3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sonos&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIxZTcxZGM2OS0wYWQ3LTQ3ZTctYWJmNS1kYzM5MjY1NTdmYTMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc29ub3MuY29tL2VuLXVzL3Nob3AvZml2ZSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMjJlM2YwYjctYzE3OS0zOTJhLTgyMWMtZTZkZjUzYzI4MGE2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAR25cLMb2vxNkMKEVe6NeoOcX395yZzkj30eSdpml_uG&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Ffive\">Sonos Five</a> is one of our favorite pure music speakers. It has many of the conveniences in the Era 100 and sounds significantly better than any other Sonos speaker. It also sounds much better than the Echo Studio and anything Google is currently selling.</p><p>That said, the Five stretches our definition of a smart speaker here because it doesn't have a built-in voice assistant. But it's so good at music playback that it's worth recommending you pick one up along with an Echo Dot or Nest Mini. Both of those speakers work with Sonos, so you can use voice commands to control the Five just as you would a dedicated Alexa or Google Assistant device. Sonos also refreshed the speaker two years ago with a new wireless radio as well as more memory and a faster processor. This means it should stay current and work with future Sonos software updates for years to come.</p><p>Since we're talking \"best\" here, I'm going to go ahead and recommend that true music junkies splash out on two Five speakers and pair them in stereo. Put simply, it's the most enjoyable experience I've had listening to music in years; I found myself picking up new details while listening to albums I've heard over and over again. It's a wonderful experience and worth saving for if you're a music lover. I didn't know what I was missing until I tried the Five.</p><p>Sonos also just released the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1e71dc69-0ad7-47e7-abf5-dc3926557fa3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sonos&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIxZTcxZGM2OS0wYWQ3LTQ3ZTctYWJmNS1kYzM5MjY1NTdmYTMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc29ub3MuY29tL2VuLXVzL3Nob3AvZXJhLTMwMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMjJlM2YwYjctYzE3OS0zOTJhLTgyMWMtZTZkZjUzYzI4MGE2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAVjDDSsafMZzXOPRzL6yDO_3xbdyYsxSHlScfT0ot5w0&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fera-300\">Era 300</a>, a $450 speaker that supports Dolby Atmos spatial audio from Apple Music and Amazon Music Unlimited. I\u2019ve found that the quality of spatial audio mixes can be very hit or miss, but the good news is that the Era 300 sounds outstanding whether it\u2019s playing back Atmos content or just standard tracks. It\u2019s not quite as good as the Sonos Five, but it does have built-in microphones for voice assistants and easy Trueplay tuning as well as Bluetooth and the redesigned controls on the Era 100. Again, the main downside is that Google Assistant isn\u2019t supported here.</p><p>Finally, if you\u2019re an Apple Music user or have a lot of Apple hardware in your home, the second-generation <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0MTMwZTJmMC1hMTRmLTRjNWUtYmRhYi1jZDUyYWM3ZDhlNzkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL2hvbWVwb2QvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyMmUzZjBiNy1jMTc5LTM5MmEtODIxYy1lNmRmNTNjMjgwYTYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZLnR3S2KbD5Q6PLJUnEcdOnwGDQLbiRbs0LzN41wTFq&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fhomepod%2F\">HomePod</a> is definitely worth considering. At $300, it\u2019s a lot cheaper than these Sonos speakers but supports spatial audio like the Era 300. The Era 300 and Sonos Five are better speakers overall (and certainly much louder), but there's a lot to like about the HomePod\u2019s audio quality at its price point. It\u2019s a clear, crisp vocal-forward speaker, and its design and software processing does a great job of making music sound like it\u2019s all around you, even if you\u2019re not playing back Dolby Atmos tracks.</p><h2>Best portable smart speaker: Sonos Roam</h2><p></p><p>While many people will be happy with a few speakers strategically placed throughout their home, you might want something that works outside as well as inside. Fortunately, you can find speakers that pair voice controls and strong music playback performance with portable, weatherproof form factors. For my money, it's hard to beat the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1e71dc69-0ad7-47e7-abf5-dc3926557fa3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sonos&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIxZTcxZGM2OS0wYWQ3LTQ3ZTctYWJmNS1kYzM5MjY1NTdmYTMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc29ub3MuY29tL2VuLXVzL3Nob3Avcm9hbSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMjJlM2YwYjctYzE3OS0zOTJhLTgyMWMtZTZkZjUzYzI4MGE2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAeq2_H9R60wVGN9EP4TrWro8mlqbdOt9_4uJX6UE_CCp&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Froam\">Sonos Roam</a> for sheer versatility, not to mention audio quality.</p><p>When used inside the home, the Roam works like any other Sonos speaker. It fits in with an existing multi-room Sonos setup, or you can get a pair for stereo playback. Like most other Sonos speakers, it works with the Sonos Voice Assistant, Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa, and it supports essentially every major music service available. It sounds very good given its tiny size; it\u2019s quieter and not quite as clear as the Sonos One or the Era 100, but it still packs a surprising bass thump and distinct highs.</p><p>Since it was designed with on-the-go usage in mind, the Roam has a battery and Bluetooth so you can take it anywhere and use it far away from your WiFi network. And its diminutive size makes it easy to take it everywhere, both around the house and out and about. It\u2019s also the first Sonos speaker that is fully waterproof, as well as dust- and drop-resistant, so you shouldn\u2019t worry about taking it to the pool or beach.</p><p>The Roam gets about 10 hours of battery life, whether you're on WiFI or Bluetooth. There are other portable speakers that last longer, so if you\u2019re really going to push the battery you might be better served by another option.</p><p>Sonos also has another portable option, the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=1e71dc69-0ad7-47e7-abf5-dc3926557fa3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Sonos&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIxZTcxZGM2OS0wYWQ3LTQ3ZTctYWJmNS1kYzM5MjY1NTdmYTMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc29ub3MuY29tL2VuLXVzL3Nob3AvbW92ZSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMjJlM2YwYjctYzE3OS0zOTJhLTgyMWMtZTZkZjUzYzI4MGE2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAf9M3XjMC0rhmFH7biYEPUpkOqa2PQFYcaozlglnQTbi&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fmove\">Move</a>. It\u2019s much larger and louder than the Roam and has better sound quality, which it should given that it costs $400. But, rumors indicate Sonos is getting ready to replace it this fall with a new model. With that in mind, I\u2019d recommend most people interested in a speaker like this wait to see what Sonos has coming up \u2013 $400 is a lot of money to spend on hardware that\u2019s about to be replaced.</p><p>A better choice than the Move, unless you already have other Sonos products, is the $399 <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Cb3NlLVBvcnRhYmxlLUhvbWUtU3BlYWtlci1CdWlsdC9kcC9CMDdWRktCUTNLP3RoPTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZDYtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjIyZTNmMGI3LWMxNzktMzkyYS04MjFjLWU2ZGY1M2MyODBhNiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAcJ8lMPA4i0iXXFpC6cy2D1NxIuyoKaZL6BUuU7fBz7v&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBose-Portable-Home-Speaker-Built%2Fdp%2FB07VFKBQ3K%3Fth%3D1\">Bose Portable Smart speaker</a>. It supports Alexa and Google Assistant commands, and since it can connect to WiFi, you can ask your preferred assistant to play music from Spotify, Amazon Music and other services. On top of that, it produces well-rounded sound, sports an IPX4 design with a convenient carry handle and will last up to 12 hours on a single charge.</p><p>Bose also has a good alternative to the Roam. The $149 <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Cb3NlLVNvdW5kTGluay1CbHVldG9vdGgtUG9ydGFibGUtV2F0ZXJwcm9vZi9kcC9CMDk5VEpHSjkxP3RoPTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tZDYtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjIyZTNmMGI3LWMxNzktMzkyYS04MjFjLWU2ZGY1M2MyODBhNiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAWApfm9Tkcg4KZ_ozvq88khu_GJ_3edD8nKreQxBN7lX&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBose-SoundLink-Bluetooth-Portable-Waterproof%2Fdp%2FB099TJGJ91%3Fth%3D1\">SoundLink Flex</a> supports Siri and Google Assistant commands, plus it has an IP67 design that's roughly the size of a small clutch bag.

She can use it to toast bread, bake dishes or reheat food. Sure, a full-size oven can do the same thing, but firing it up can often warm up the whole house, which isn\u2019t so great in the summer months. It\u2019s also a lot more efficient. While a regular oven might need 20 or so minutes to preheat, a toaster oven can often get to temperature in just five or 10 minutes.</p><p>We also like this model for its 1-cubic-foot capacity. (In lay terms, it can fit a 9-by-13-inch casserole or a 14-pound turkey.) It can handle <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-air-fryers-133047180.html\">air frying</a> (thanks to a \u201csuper convection\u201d mode) and it comes with an air fryer basket that\u2019s large enough to fit a dozen chicken wings.

There are even recipes she can try out in the app, including some that have an \u201cautopilot\u201d feature, which automatically adjusts the oven\u2019s temperature during cooking to make things like perfectly golden croissants and bread loaves. \u2014 <em>N.L.</em></p><h2>Nintendo Switch Lite</h2><p></p><p>Women play games too, even if a lot of games marketing still says otherwise.

However, they may not be such a good deal after all, according to a new report called <a href=\"https://pirg.org/media-center/new-chromebook-churn-report-highlights-problems-of-short-lived-laptops-in-schools/\"><em>Chromebook Churn</em></a> from the US Public Interest Research Group (PIRG). They found that many Chromebooks purchased just three years ago are already breaking, creating electronic waste and costing taxpayers money.&nbsp;</p><p>Chromebooks in schools typically see rough use, and repairability is a key issue, due to a lack of parts and expensive repairs. For instance, 14 out of 29 keyboard replacements for Acer Chromebooks were found to be out of stock, and 10 of the 29 cost $90 each \u2014 nearly half the price of some models. &quot;These high costs may make schools reconsider Chromebooks as a cost-saving strategy,&quot; the report states. In another instance, HP only stocked power cords and AC adapters for one model, but no other parts.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The devices also have built in &quot;death dates,&quot; the report reads, after which software updates end. &quot;Once laptops have 'expired,' they don\u2019t receive updates and can\u2019t access secure websites.&quot; Google does provide eight years of software updates for Chromebooks, but that's only from the date of release. Since many schools buy Chromebooks released several years before, support can expire in half that time.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Chromebooks aren\u2019t built to last. Professional repair techs tell me they\u2019re often forced to chuck good Chromebook hardware with years of life left due to aggressive software expiration dates.</p></blockquote><p>&quot;Chromebooks aren\u2019t built to last. Professional repair techs tell me they\u2019re often forced to chuck good Chromebook hardware with years of life left due to aggressive software expiration dates,&quot; iFixit's director of sustainability Elizabeth Chamberlain told PIRG. Those expiration dates also make it a challenge for schools to resell their devices. PCs and Macs may have a higher purchase price, but they can easily be resold after a couple of years and can get updates for longer periods of time.</p><p>The organization said that doubling the lifespan of the Chromebooks sold in 2020 (some 31.8 million) &quot;could cut emissions by 4.6 million tons of CO2e, equivalent to taking 900,000 cars off the road for a year. To do that, they recommend that Google eliminate update expirations and that its manufacturing partners production a 10 percent overstock of replacement parts, and that those parts be more standardized across models. They also say that consumers should be allowed to install alternative operating systems like Linux.</p><p>In a statement to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/chromebooks-arent-built-to-last-average-device-has-4-years-of-updates-left/\"><em>Ars Technica</em></a>, Google said: &quot;Regular Chromebook software updates add new features and improve device security every four weeks, allowing us to continuously iterate on the software experience while ensuring that older devices continue to function in a secure and reliable manner until their hardware limitations make it extremely difficult to provide updates.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>It added that it's &quot;always working with our device manufacturing partners to increasingly build devices across segments with post-consumer recycled and certified materials that are more repairable, and over time use manufacturing processes that reduce emissions.&quot;</p><p>Google needs to do better, though, according to the group. &quot;The least we can do for students who rely on their laptops is ensure these devices are durable and repairable\u2014not part of a constant churn,&quot; said PIRG's Lucas Rockett Gutterman. &quot;With more tech in our lives and classrooms, if Google wants to be a trusted source for tens of millions of students, they need to make laptops that families and school districts can count on.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/chromebooks-short-lifespans-are-creating-piles-of-electronic-waste-063314306.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/chromebooks-short-lifespans-are-creating-piles-of-electronic-waste-063314306.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-24 06:33:14+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
