Peterson and Naomi Wolf discuss her original ambitions, the derailment of her scholarly career at the hands of misogyny, her rise to the forefront of third wave feminism as a best-selling author, and how the mainstream turned on her once she wrote on a topic the Left had blacklisted: COVID-19.\n\nNaomi Wolf is an American author and journalist. Her first book, \u201cThe Beauty Myth,\u201d would challenge notions of attraction, arguing they are societally fabricated. This publication became an international bestseller and cemented Wolf as one of the leading spokeswomen for the third wave feminist movement. She has published many books since then, such as \u201cThe End of America, and Vagina: A New Biography.\u201d In recent years, she has come under fire for being an \u201canti-vaxer\u201d and a \u201cconspiracy theorist,\u201d which led Wolf to write her most recent book, \u201cThe Bodies of Others: The New Authoritarians, COVID-19 and The War Against the Human.\u201d\n\n\n- Sponsors -\n\nElysium Health: Get 15% off sitewide!
