Whether you played the original back in 2019 and want a story recap, are keen to know where Jedi: Fallen Order slots into the canon timeline, or maybe you\u2019re just jumping into Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, let\u2019s break down the story so far.\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:38 - Chapter 1\n03:30 - Chapter 2\n04:54 - Chapter 3\n06:57 - Chapter 4\n08:52 - Chapter 5\n12:30 - Chapter 6\n14:38 - Star Wars Jedi: Battle Scars\n\nIn the above video, we break down and recap the full story from Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. The video goes through the story beats from the main campaign from the introduction of Cal Kestis to the climactic ending at the Fortress Inquisitorius. \n\nStar Wars Jedi: Fallen Order takes place in the year 14 BBY, which, put simply, means 14 years Before the Battle of Yavin 4, the epic destruction of the Death Star seen in Star Wars: Episode 4 - A New Hope. It\u2019s about 5 years since the chilling events of Episode 3 - Revenge of the Sith, and the execution of Order 66 - the galaxy wide purge of the Jedi. \n\nTimeline Playlist - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gaFRoP4RUA&amp;list=PLpg6WLs8kxGN7aotOq-B5tYZWpvTZ3KRS", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8XeSOwAnlw", "date_published": "2023-04-24 14:00:14+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
