Russia\u2019s defence ministry meanwhile accused Ukraine of attempting to attack its ships in the Black Sea, which it said was threatening prospects of extending the deal.</p><p><strong>A woman charged with killing a pro-war Russian military blogger using explosives has been denied bail by a Russian court.</strong> Darya Trepova, 26, is accused of killing Vladen Tatarsky, whose real name was Maxim Fomin, on 2 April.

He once wrote that \u201cprose drama is one of the lesser arts, like wood-carving or dancing, but in so far as it is an art at all, its purpose is to afford delight. I do not think it can usefully concern itself with the welfare of humanity or the saving of civilisation.\u201d Yet this is the man who in For Services Rendered, first seen in 1932 and since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/07/for-services-rendered-five-star-review-theatre-excellent-work-from-a-flawless-cast\">much revived</a>, wrote a blistering attack on the ruinous aftermath of the first world war and the creation of a society unfit for heroes.</p><p>You could argue that play is a special case.
