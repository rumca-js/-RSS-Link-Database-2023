<p id="vQWYRI">“There is a lively and important debate about the role played in our economy and democracy by online transaction platforms with market power,” the ruling states. “Our job as a federal Court of Appeals, however, is not to resolve that debate—nor could we even attempt to do so.

You can upload a video of someone cycling in the park, for example, and apply an aesthetic or theme. You can give the video the look of a watercolor painting or charcoal sketch, and so on.</p>

  <p id="tvlFBq">Some owners of AMD’s latest 7000X3D series CPUs have reported that their processors have burnt out randomly. Reports across Reddit and on YouTube suggest that a number of 7950X3D and 7800X3D owners have experienced burn damage to both the CPU and the AM5 socket, killing the processors and motherboards.</p>
<p id="eaAluF">It’s a nightmare situation for any PC owner, particularly since, in many cases, these are new CPUs and motherboards that have only been on the market for a matter of weeks.</p>
<p id="ffMtQE">“Came home to my system idling full fan and QCode of 00,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12tlk7s/7800x3d_just_killed_itself_and_my_mobo/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">said Reddit user Speedrookie</a>. “Reset BIOS, play[ed] with memory, then took it apart to find the 7800X3D bulged out and took the socket with it.” Speedrookie posted a photo of the affected CPU with a visible bulge...</p>

  <p id="JLYGOP">While major record labels have been trying to fend off songs using AI voice tracks of famous artists, Grimes has other ideas.</p>
<p id="ghiIRB">“I’ll split 50% royalties on any successful AI generated song that uses my voice,” Grimes <a href="https://twitter.com/Grimezsz/status/1650304051718791170">posted on Twitter</a> Sunday night. “Feel free to use my voice without penalty,” she said, claiming she has no label and “no legal bindings.”</p>
<p id="5EcGz5">At this point, Grimes’ Sunday night tweet seems to be just that — a late-night tweet that maybe, possibly, potentially could become something in the future. Grimes didn’t add much detail as to how arrangements like this would work but <a href="https://twitter.com/Grimezsz/status/1650315770646396933">said</a> the profit sharing could apply to “viral” or “super popular” tracks made using her voice that are already floating around.</p>

Called <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>, the game looks similar to <em>Genshin</em> but with more of a sci-fi twist. That means slick anime visuals, large worlds to explore, and a seemingly never-ending list of things to do, thanks to its live-service nature.</p>

  <p id="geIbNj">More details are emerging about the design of Apple’s long-awaited mixed reality headset ahead of its expected unveiling on June 5th. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-04-23/apple-s-ar-vr-headset-plans-ipad-apps-fitness-sports-viewing-gaming-music-lgtgopgx"><em>Bloomberg</em>’s Mark Gurman</a> reports that the headset’s external battery pack — which is designed to sit in the user’s pocket during use — will have a similar design to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588777/apple-magsafe-battery-review-size-iphone-12-mini">Apple’s MagSafe iPhone battery pack</a> and will use a proprietary connector to attach to the headset.</p>
<p id="BIIXWI">This circular connector is reportedly magnetic and designed to lock into the headset during use with a twist so it can’t be accidentally detached. Meanwhile, the opposite end of the cable is reportedly hardwired into the battery pack. The two “aren’t separable,” <em>Bloomberg</em> reports. So if this power cable develops a fault, it sounds like there’s no...</p>

<p id="94pZy0">It’s likely that the re-appearance of their blue ticks is part of a wider (but unannounced) scheme by Twitter to restore verification to users with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/marisadellatto/2023/04/23/twitter-restores-blue-check-marks-to-some-big-accounts-but-some-celebrities-dont-want-them/?sh=64104e4b73a1">over one million followers</a>. But hover over the blue ticks of the accounts of dead celebs, and Twitter will tell you they’re verified “because they are subscribed to Twitter Blue and verified their phone number.” </p>
