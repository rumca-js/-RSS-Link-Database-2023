<p>The most confusing thing about the Ugreen USB-C Triple Display Docking Station is its name&mdash;because, inexplicably, it doesn&rsquo;t match what&rsquo;s on the box. Although its engineering is excellent, whoever orchestrated its marketing and support needs a talking-to.</p>



<p>Stay with us for a moment. On Ugreen&rsquo;s site (and Amazon) this dock is known as the Ugreen USB-C Triple Display Docking Station (12-in-1), and that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve chosen to identify it as. Ugreen&rsquo;s actual box, however, labels it as the USB-C Multifunction Docking Station PRO (Model CM555), as shown above. However, a link within the CM555&rsquo;s documentation directs you to the &ldquo;Triple Display&rdquo; <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.ugreen.com/products/ugreen-usb-c-triple-display-docking-station&amp;xcust=2-2-1782854-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Ugreen link</a>, which cost $329.99 at press time. (Amazon&rsquo;s price is a bit less.)  It gets stranger: The Ugreen site also features a &ldquo;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.ugreen.com/products/christmas-special-discount-docking-station-13-in-1&amp;xcust=2-2-1782854-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">2023 Recommend Docking Station</a>&rdquo; with a &ldquo;Christmas discount&rdquo; in the URL, which appears to be exactly the same dock&mdash;yet $90 cheaper.</p>



<p>The driver link also hints at something Ugreen doesn&rsquo;t tell you: that this is a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/801587/why-new-usb-c-displaylink-docks-are-better-and-worse-than-thunderbolt.html">DisplayLink USB-C dock</a>, which uses compression software to facilitate the interface.</p>



<p>This isn&rsquo;t a bad thing; as we&rsquo;ve seen with DisplayLink docks, these <em>can</em> be cheaper, stabler solutions that offer just about everything that a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393714/best-thunderbolt-docks-for-a-laptop-pc">true Thunderbolt dock</a> does. Here, the price pushes into traditional Thunderbolt dock territory, but with basically all of the features of a Thunderbolt dock, and <em>without</em> needing a Thunderbolt port on your laptop &mdash; just a more generic USB-C interface.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>This review informs our list of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/402858/the-best-usb-c-hubs-for-your-laptop-tablet-or-2-in-1.html">best USB-C hubs and dongles</a>, which includes buying recommendations and advice.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Ugreen is a Shenzhen company, the Chinese startup hub that houses seemingly hundreds of small companies that develop I/O peripherals. As such, sometimes the companies tend to cut corners. The drivers are one example: You&rsquo;ll need to download and install the DisplayLink software before using the dock, <em>but</em> Ugreen buries mention of it on its product page <em>and</em> supplies it via MediaFire, a third-party hosting service. If this gives you the heebie-jeebies, try downloading the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.synaptics.com/products/displaylink-graphics/downloads/windows&amp;xcust=2-2-1782854-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">official DisplayLink drivers</a> from DisplayLink&rsquo;s owners, Synaptics, instead. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img alt="Ugreen USB-C Triple Display Docking Station" class="wp-image-1785797" height="850" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Ugreen-front.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The front of the Ugreen USB-C Triple Display Docking Station.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Another example of cut corners is the charger. Ugreen&rsquo;s Triple Display Docking Station can provide up to 100W to your laptop, but <em>you&rsquo;ll need to provide the charger itself.</em> Virtually all powered docks ship with a power brick, but this one doesn&rsquo;t. </p>



<p>With a few USB-C-powered laptops already around the office, this wasn&rsquo;t a problem. But if you&rsquo;re working with a gaming laptop that uses a barrel charger, you&rsquo;re going to be ticked off when you discover that you&rsquo;ll need to invest in a USB-C charger, too. On the flip side, if you already own a compact 100W GaaN charger, you win. If you don&rsquo;t, Amazon <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Docking-Station-Bundle-Charger/dp/B0BXSNQ9VW&amp;xcust=2-2-1782854-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">bundles the two together for $309.99</a>, which seems like a decent compromise.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>If you can get past the naming confusion and unearth the proper drivers, Ugreen&rsquo;s USB-C Triple Display Docking Station (12-in-1) definitely delivers.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>That matters, since the Ugreen USB-C Triple Docking Station is remarkably compact as far as docks go: about 5 inches tall by 2.5 inches deep by about 2 inches wide. The aluminum and plastic frame weighs about 0.22 pounds, and doesn&rsquo;t get overly hot under load. This is a solution that can work on the road, provided you own a charger.</p>



<p>On balance, though, Ugreen&rsquo;s dock is a pleasure to work with, from the small unnecessary (but welcome) power button and LED on the top of the unit to varied number of ports to work with. On the front of the dock, Ugreen includes both a microSD/TF and a full-sized SD card slot, alongside both a 10Gbps USB-C slot and a 10Gbps USB-A slot. A headphone jack is there, too.</p>



<p>On the rear of the dock, Ugreen includes two 5Gbps USB-A slots for legacy mice and wired keyboards, the 10Gbps USB-C link to your laptop, and the USB-C charger input. There are also three display ports: a 4K/60Hz-capable HDMI port, a similarly configured DisplayPort, and an HDMI port capable of 8K at 30Hz. (Ugreen doesn&rsquo;t provide exact specifications.)</p>



<p>DisplayLink docks are terrific for productivity: They&rsquo;ll power a pair of 4K displays at an eye-pleasing 60Hz just fine. What they typically don&rsquo;t project are any HDR capabilities, even if the display supports them. (Trying to enable HDR caused one test display to turn off.) They also don&rsquo;t typically power high-refresh-rate displays. However, the &ldquo;8K&rdquo; port does put out enough bandwidth for a 1440p display at 144Hz, Ugreen says, which pushes into gaming scenarios.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Ugreen USB-C Triple Display Docking Station" class="wp-image-1785799" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Ugreen-back.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The rear of the Ugreen USB-C Triple Display Docking Station offers a number of convenient ports.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<h2 id="how-does-the-ugreen-usb-c-triple-display-dock-perform">How does the Ugreen USB-C Triple Display Dock perform?</h2>



<p>The problem with USB-C docks is that the bandwidth you&rsquo;ll see can be dependent on the dock, your laptop&rsquo;s ports, and the available GPU&mdash;and most vendors don&rsquo;t bother breaking that down. On a Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio with Thunderbolt capabilities, Ugreen&rsquo;s dock drove three separate displays simultaneously: the internal laptop display, two 4K displays running at 60Hz, and a widescreen 1440p display capable of 144Hz, though at only 100Hz. We found that to also be the case for an HP Victus laptop with a discrete GPU, a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394409/surface-laptop-4-ryzen-7-review.html">Surface Laptop 4 (Ryzen)</a>, and a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1499055/samsung-galaxy-book3-pro-360-review.html">Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro 360</a>. (The Surface Laptop Studio and Galaxy Book3 Pro 360 include Thunderbolt ports; the other two laptops do not.)</p>



<p>Under each scenario, the dock performed very well, provided that the laptops installed the proper DisplayLink drivers. (If you don&rsquo;t, the display output will stutter.) But they&rsquo;re not miracle workers, either: With the three external displays each running 4K streamed videos, the video began &ldquo;surging&rdquo;: playing video at normal speed, then slowing down a bit, though noticeably. It didn&rsquo;t deliver enough power to access an external SSD, and when streaming video from an external hard drive in conjunction with the streamed video, everything bogged down noticeably.</p>



<p>Still, playing all of that back over a standard 10Gbps USB-C connection was an excellent experience. Remember that working in Word, Outlook, or in Edge or Chrome will put less stress on this Ugreen dock, and it should perform even better.</p>



<p>Ugreen doesn&rsquo;t specifically call out any of the ports for charging purposes, but all of the USB-A ports deliver 3.7W&mdash;not great, but typical of similar docks. The front-mounted USB-C port does better: 7.8W, which is enough to charge a smartphone, though not fast-charge it.</p>



<p>Ugreen&rsquo;s USB-C Triple Display Docking Station definitely has some really odd quirks, cut corners, and other foibles. It&rsquo;s also quite expensive, too, especially since you have to supply a charger.  We couldn&rsquo;t find any warranty information, either. However, if you can get past the naming confusion and unearth the proper driver, this USB-C dock definitely delivers.</p>

## AMD motherboards add BIOS restrictions after reports of X3D chips burning out

<p>If you&rsquo;re lucky enough to have <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1524570/amd-ryzen-9-7950x3d-review-v-cache.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">one of AMD&rsquo;s screaming new X3D CPUs</a> designed from the ground up to boost gaming performance, you might want to check your motherboard&rsquo;s manufacturer for a new BIOS update. After a few isolated reports of Ryzen 7000X3D chips burning out after just a few weeks, the company seems to be working with AM5 motherboard manufacturers to put new voltage restrictions in place. Better safe than sorry, I suppose. </p>



<p>Over the weekend several reports from Reddit users (collected by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-ryzen-7000x3d-burnout-reports&amp;xcust=2-2-1796033-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Tom&rsquo;s Hardware</a>) and notable overclocker der8auer indicated that something was amiss with the chips and at least some motherboard models. If you&rsquo;ve been reading up on the Ryzen X3D chips, which feature extra V-cache accessible to half the processor cores, you know that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/633599/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-amds-new-ryzen-7-5800x3d-processor.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">they don&rsquo;t allow overclocking</a> via standard software tools. That extra cache apparently makes the chips much more sensitive to temperature variations than normal Ryzen CPUs, so easy overclocking has been disabled as an act of caution. (Not that it stops the more dedicated overclockers, of course.) X3D chips can still get limited bursts of extra speed via Precision Boost Overdrive. </p>



<p>Early this morning an official MSI employee <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.reddit.com/r/MSI_Gaming/comments/12x5uaq/new_am5_series_motherboard_bios_implement_cpu/&amp;xcust=2-2-1796033-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">posting on the company&rsquo;s subreddit</a> announced a series of BIOS updates, sent out for MSI AMD motherboards with X670E, X670-P, B650, and A620 chipsets, which restrict voltage settings to negative offset only. That should make it almost impossible for less technical users to overclock the X3D processors beyond the Precision Boost Overdrive mode, which is getting an enhanced mode with the new changes. </p>



<p>Other manufacturers of AMD-compatible motherboards haven&rsquo;t released new BIOS updates, but more may follow soon out of an abundance of caution &mdash; those X3D chips don&rsquo;t come cheap. Asus, which has seen a few of the isolated burnout incidents as well, has <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/9550pro/status/1649621031588630529&amp;xcust=2-2-1796033-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pulled some of its latest motherboar</a><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/9550pro/status/1649621031588630529&amp;xcust=2-2-1796033-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">d</a><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/9550pro/status/1649621031588630529&amp;xcust=2-2-1796033-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> BIOS updates</a> from its download page, probably in advanced of similar patches. </p>

<p>Simply deleting the data off your hard drive doesn&rsquo;t erase it as you might expect. Instead, NTFS (the file system used by Windows PCs) just hides the data from immediate view, leaving it to be overwritten when a new file takes up residence on the drive. That&rsquo;s a workable scenario for everyday use, but it could spell disaster when it&rsquo;s time to part with an old machine&mdash;and as a recent report about <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1792155/old-business-routers-are-leaking-sensitive-data-and-its-a-warning-to-us-all.html">decommissioned routers leaking sensitive business data</a> shows, some people <em>do</em> hunt for leftover information scraps.</p>



<p>To truly destroy the data on your storage device you need to take more drastic (and time-consuming) measures to overwrite your drive space with ones and zeroes. That&rsquo;s where this guide comes in.</p>



<p>Different technology and scenarios call for different tools. We&rsquo;ll identify the best secure-erasing utility for every job, no matter what type of drive you&rsquo;re using&mdash;even USB flash drives. If you want to erase only specific files, we&rsquo;ll show you how to do that, too. Best of all, <em>almost</em> every solution discussed here is free.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407569/the-best-free-backup-software-and-services.html">Back up your data</a>! Once these programs get to work, you can&rsquo;t go back for a forgotten file. This is a one-way street to data oblivion. Also if you&rsquo;re erasing the drive on a laptop, be sure to plug the notebook in before you start. If the battery gets spent and the power goes out in the middle of a disk wipe it could spell disaster for the drive.</p>

<p>With that out of the way let&rsquo;s talk terminology. Drive-wipe utilities let you specify how many &ldquo;passes&rdquo; the software makes. Each pass signifies a complete overwrite of the data. A utility that makes three passes overwrites your drive with ones and zeroes three separate times. The more times you overwrite your data, the less likely it is to be recovered. Some utilities support &ldquo;Gutmann&rdquo;-level protection with 35 passes, but three passes is enough for the U.S. Department of Defense&rsquo;s &ldquo;Short&rdquo; specification and for numerous militaries around the globe.</p>



<p>If you do choose to erase your data with any of these methods, you do so at your own risk&mdash;which is why we advise making a backup before you begin. Nevertheless, we have used all of these methods successfully in the past.</p>



<h2 id="securely-erase-specific-files-with-eraser">Securely erase specific files with Eraser</h2>



<p>If you need to delete only specific files and folders rather than entire drives, the open-source&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://eraser.heidi.ie/&amp;xcust=2-1-461014-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Eraser&nbsp;is the tool for you</a>. Just boot up the program, click the arrow next to the &lsquo;Erase Schedule&rsquo; option at the top of the screen, and select&nbsp;<em>New task</em>. From there, a window pops up with the task and time-scheduling options. Click&nbsp;<em>Add Data</em>&nbsp;to select the files to wipe and choose an erasure method. (I usually go with the DoD three-pass option.)</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/06/eraser-100891654-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="eraser" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/06/eraser-100891654-medium.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption>
<p>Eraser 6.2 for Windows.</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p>An Eraser option also appears when you right-click on a file in Windows Explorer, allowing you to permanently delete files quickly and easily.</p>



<p>Eraser has a ton of advanced scheduling and file options if you want to securely wipe specific files or sectors of your hard drive on a regular basis. Be careful while you tinker with the finer settings, though&mdash;you don&rsquo;t want to accidentally wipe something important. Also note that Eraser is meant for mechanical hard drives, as the wear-leveling algorithms in solid-states drives (SSDs) negate the utility&rsquo;s ability to securely wipe information.</p>



<h2 id="securely-erase-your-usb-flash-drive">Securely erase your USB flash drive</h2>



<p>Did you think using Erase was simple?&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.roadkil.net/program.php/P14/Disk%20Wipe&amp;xcust=2-1-461014-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Roadkil&rsquo;s Disk Wipe</a>&nbsp;is even easier, and it works just fine on USB flash drives as well as traditional hard drives. Simply download, unzip, and boot the itty-bitty application, and then select a drive and type in the number of passes you&rsquo;d like the program to make. (Again, we suggest at least three.)</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/06/diskwipe-100891653-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="diskwipe" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/06/diskwipe-100891653-medium.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption>

<p>Choose to either wipe the disk or fill it with junk data, click Erase, and you&rsquo;re done. Roadkil&rsquo;s Disk Wipe hasn&rsquo;t been updated in years, but it just works. Be sure to select your operating system when downloading the utility; Windows 10 users can choose the Windows 8 option.</p>



<h2 id="securely-erase-a-mechanical-hard-drive-with-dban">Securely erase a mechanical hard drive with DBAN</h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>A note on whole-disk wiping software:&nbsp;</strong>Wiping entire drives requires slightly more complicated solutions than the easy-to-use apps mentioned previously. Since you&rsquo;ll be deleting the data from the drive that likely holds your PC&rsquo;s operating system, most tools that wipe whole drives require you to move the program to a flash drive or create a bootable thumb drive from an .iso file.</p><p>To ensure that things run smoothly, you should also dive into your BIOS settings and make sure that your drives are set to IDE mode.</p></blockquote>



<p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://dban.org/&amp;xcust=2-1-461014-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Download DBAN</a>&mdash;a time-tested option for erasing HDDs that&rsquo;s loved by geeks around the world despite the fact that it hasn&rsquo;t been updated in years. Once you&rsquo;ve downloaded it and created a bootable USB, insert the drive into your PC, and&nbsp;tell your computer to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3057176/the-hidden-challenges-of-booting-from-a-usb-flash-drive.html">boot from the USB drive</a>&nbsp;rather than your hard drive. If you&rsquo;re hoping to erase a RAID-enabled hard drive, you&rsquo;ll need to disassemble the RAID volume and set each disk to JBOD mode before you start, as well.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/06/dban-100891652-orig.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="dban" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/06/dban-100891652-medium.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption>

<p>Once DBAN is up and running in all its blue-and-white glory, you simply select which disk to wipe, and press the&nbsp;<strong>M</strong>&nbsp;key on your keyboard to select an erasure method. The three-pass &ldquo;DoD Short&rdquo; is (still) my preferred method, though more-robust options are available. Press&nbsp;<strong>F10</strong>&nbsp;to start the wipe once everything looks good. Depending on the method you choose and the size of the disk, erasing the data can take hours or even days. Bring a sandwich and your phone, or better yet, walk away and do something else while DBAN does its magic.</p>



<h2 id="securely-erase-a-hybrid-drive-or-ssd-with-secure-erase-or-parted-magic">Securely erase a hybrid drive or SSD with Secure Erase or Parted Magic</h2>



<p>Wiping data off of an SSD is a little different than erasing data from a HDD thanks to the wear-leveling algorithms used to write data evenly to an SSD. To securely erase all the data on an SSD, you use a command&mdash;called <a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8200811-15180503?sid=2-1-461014-1-0-0&amp;url=https://industrial.apacer.com/en-ww/Technology/ATA-Secure-Erase" rel="nofollow">ATA Secure Erase</a> or <a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8200811-15180503?sid=2-1-461014-1-0-0&amp;url=https://industrial.apacer.com/en-ww/Technology/NVMe-Secure-Erase#:~:text=NVMe%20Secure%20Erase%20is%20an,erase%20all%20user%20data%20areas." rel="nofollow">NVMe Secure Erase</a>, appropriately enough&mdash;that&rsquo;s built into the firmware of modern SATA and NVMe SSDs and older PATA/IDE drives.</p>



<p>Most modern SSDs ship with the ability to initiate secure erase, or the manufacturer provides a proprietary tool such as <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.crucial.com/support/storage-executive&amp;xcust=2-1-461014-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Crucial</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/minisite/ssd/download/tools/&amp;xcust=2-1-461014-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Samsung</a>, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://kb.sandisk.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/15108/~/sandisk-ssd-dashboard-support-information&amp;xcust=2-1-461014-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">SanDisk,</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.seagate.com/em/en/support/downloads/seatools/&amp;xcust=2-1-461014-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Seagate</a> and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.wdc.com/downloads.aspx?p=279&amp;lang=en&amp;xcust=2-1-461014-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Western Digital</a>. If your drive maker doesn&rsquo;t offer a secure erase solution or the manufacturer solution doesn&rsquo;t handle reformatting boot drives you have two options. If the drive is removable, you can <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3604739/how-to-build-your-own-high-performance-portable-ssd.html">plop it into an external drive case</a>, and connect it to another PC via USB to wipe it from there.</p>

<p>The easier option is the go-to third-party utility,&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://partedmagic.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-461014-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Parted Magic</a>. This, however, is where we run into a paywall. At this writing, Parted Magic costs $11 for a copy of the software, or $39 for a lifetime subscription, meaning you get continuous updates. The utility is awesome and easily worth the price.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After payment, download the Parted Magic .iso and create a bootable thumb drive. Boot the drive, and you&rsquo;ll get to a Windows-like desktop screen. On the desktop there&rsquo;s an <em>Erase Disk</em> launcher.&nbsp;Now it&rsquo;s just a matter of following the instructions. Parted Magic&rsquo;s help pages also provide instructions on what to do for both <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://partedmagic.com/secure-erase/&amp;xcust=2-1-461014-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">regular SSDs</a> and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://partedmagic.com/nvme-secure-erase/&amp;xcust=2-1-461014-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">NVMe drives</a>.</p>



<p>If Parted Magic warns that your drive is frozen, put your computer to sleep as suggested, turn it back on, and rerun the utility. If you&rsquo;re asked whether you want to run an Enhanced Secure Erase, click&nbsp;<em>No</em>; you&rsquo;ll want to stick to the tried-and-true standard version.</p>

## 5 Gmail settings I always change (and 3 more I turn off)

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>Gmail is popular for a reason&mdash;it comes packed with quite a few features. But some of its defaults can be annoying or limited.</p>



<p>Fortunately, you can fix that. Dive into the settings and you&rsquo;ll find a surprising number of tweaks you can make to the interface. If you haven&rsquo;t already spent some time in there, I highly recommend it. You may find a few features you didn&rsquo;t know about before.</p>



<p>Not sure where to start? You can take a cue from my favorites. Among the list are five settings I absolutely have to change in order to find Gmail usable, and they&rsquo;re pretty universal. Try them out, and if you don&rsquo;t end up liking them, you can make different adjustments for your account.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Maximum page size:</strong> I can&rsquo;t stand seeing only a handful of messages at one time, and to me, anything under 50 messages is a handful. I bump that number straight up to 100.</li><li><strong>Undo send:</strong> Sometimes I&rsquo;m too quick to hit &ldquo;Send&rdquo; on an email (or Alt + Enter). Enabling this feature lets me snatch back the email before it&rsquo;s truly sent to fix a typo or rephrase a sentence I&rsquo;m having second thoughts about. I set my window of opportunity to the max of 30 seconds, but you can go shorter.</li><li><strong>Keyboard shortcuts:</strong> I&rsquo;m fast with a mouse, but even faster when jamming on my keyboard. With only a handful of these enabled, they make my life so much easier. And if I ever forget a command, typing <strong>?</strong> while in Gmail brings up a handy cheat sheet. Plus, you can also turn on custom keyboard shortcuts to really supercharge these.</li><li><strong>Unread message icon:</strong> For some people, seeing how many unread messages they have isn&rsquo;t useful (and might give the heebie-jeebies). But I leave only messages requiring follow up in my Inbox, so seeing that icon number change is subtle and effective way to know when I should jump back into my Gmail tab.</li><li><strong>Stars:</strong> You can star email to more easily follow up on the messages&mdash;but that one yellow star is a default that&rsquo;s easily changed to include more color options. I detailed the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1683414/star-your-emails-like-a-pro-in-gmail-with-an-expanded-set-of-icons.html">step-by-step of turning these on</a> in a separate tip, precisely because going from one color to the full set of 12 was productivity game changer for me.</li></ul>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Gmail &quot;Stars&quot; settings option" class="wp-image-1683435" height="189" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/gmail-stars-default.png" width="1024" /><figcaption>These  are so helpful for keeping track of my important email.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<p>I love these as a starter set, but there are other settings I like to turn off, mostly because they annoy me as a writer and editor&mdash;the grammar suggestions, smart compose, and smart reply. The first two irritate me (for now, Google doesn&rsquo;t know the English language better than I do) and the latter always makes me feel like I&rsquo;m going to press the wrong button and not only send a stiff, canned robo-response&mdash;but to someone I absolutely didn&rsquo;t want to send one to.</p>



<p>Once you&rsquo;ve tried these on for size, you can do other things in Gmail to make it work better for you. Perhaps it&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393978/how-to-clean-up-your-gmail-inbox-by-quickly-deleting-old-email.html">time to purge unneeded email</a> (which might make the unread message icon a more useful feature). Or if you need, you can <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1367130/how-to-download-e-mail-from-gmail.html">download a copy your email</a>. And of course, if someone just won&rsquo;t quit sending you unwanted email, you can <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1367164/how-to-block-and-unblock-someone-in-gmail.html">block them</a>.</p>

<p>Portable monitors are a common sight on many desktops, and even more laptops. Though smaller than a standard monitor, portable monitors are inexpensive, easy to connect and, best of all, portable. You can pack up and move a portable monitor when needed, a perk that&rsquo;s equally useful for students, work-from-home parents, and globe-trotting executives.</p>



<p>There&rsquo;s just one problem: The portable monitor market is a bit of a mess. The widespread availability of small displays has opened the floodgates for numerous brands you&rsquo;ve never heard of, and quality is often sub-par. We&rsquo;ve tested multiple models to separate the best portable monitors from the rest.</p>

<p>Viewsonic&rsquo;s ColorPro VP16-OLED is a portable monitor that targets professionals and enthusiasts. It has class-leading image quality and a unique, versatile stand.</p>

<p>The 15.6-inch 1080p OLED panel delivers a brightness of 375 nits and an impressive color gamut that spans the entire sRGB and DCI-P3 color gamut. Although it lacks HDR support, it compensates with class-leading contrast, outstanding color accuracy, and numerous image quality options that will help you adjust the display to fit your needs.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll enjoy the unique attached stand that can be used as a kickstand or raised to provide a more comfortable viewing angle. It&rsquo;s the only portable monitor on the market with this feature. It adds weight, however: at 4.8 pounds, the VP16-OLED is heavier than most portable monitors.</p>

<p>Viewsonic tosses in several features that make the VP16-OLED ideal for professional content creators. It ships with a bundled hood that can be used to reduce glare in a bright environment. The monitor can also mount a standard tripod screw mount for use on-the-go in a studio or outdoors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Priced at $399.99, the VP16-OLED is more expensive than most competitors. Still, the price is more than justified by the monitor&rsquo;s performance. Most portable monitors will feel out of date within a few years, but this display will remain a top performer for years to come.</p>

<p>The Arzopa A1 Gamut is a solid 15.6-inch 1080p portable monitor that delivers good image quality, an attractive design, and useful features at a low price.</p>

<p>Arzopa opts for a simple yet elegant design that pairs a thin display panel with a small bump on the lower half to house the monitor&rsquo;s ports and internal electronics. A faux-leather cover is included to provide protection when stowed. It also folds into a kickstand when the monitor is in use.</p>

<p>The monitor has three input options: two USB-C with DisplayPort Alternate Mode and one Mini-HDMI. All required cables and accessories are included. However, the monitor&rsquo;s menu system is hard to use and offers few adjustments.</p>

<p>Image quality is great for the price. The Azorpa A1 Gamut reaches a maximum brightness of 297 nits, which is brighter than many competitors. The color gamut spans 97 percent of sRGB and 74 percent of DCI-P3. The A1 Gamut appears bright and vivid in day-to-day use and, though not ideal for professional content creation, holds up well while browsing the web, working in Microsoft Office, or viewing YouTube.</p>

<p>The Arzopa A1 Gamut retails for $170 but is frequently sold at a steep discount, often as low as $110. It&rsquo;s an absolute steal when on sale, and we highly recommend waiting for a discount if one isn&rsquo;t currently available.</p>

<p>Want a portable monitor with premium image quality at a midrange price? The Innocn K151F should be on your short list.</p>

<p>The Innocn 15K1F is a 15.6-inch 1080p OLED portable monitor priced at $269.99, providing a less expensive alternative to the Viewsonic ColorPro VP16-OLED. The 15K1F has an outstanding contrast ratio, a color gamut that spans 100 percent of sRGB and 99 percent DCI-P3, and good out-of-box color accuracy. The VP16-OLED is better, but the more affordable Innocn K151F nips at its heels.</p>

<p>Innocn&rsquo;s design feels robust and looks attractive. Connectivity is strong, too, with a pair of USB-C ports and one Mini-HDMI port, offering a variety of options and the ability to connect multiple input devise. The menu system is competitive with the VP16-OLED and offers customization for color temperature, saturation, hue, and three-axis RGB color calibration.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the included cover and kickstand could be improved. The cover physically snaps over the display and does not use magnets, which makes it a bit difficult to install or remove. The kickstand can easily slip out of place if you accidentally bump the monitor. It&rsquo;s usable but a clear step down from the kickstands available on more expensive competitors.</p>

<p>Still, it&rsquo;s hard to argue with the image quality Innocn offers for $270. It performs almost identically to the more expensive Viewsonic VP16-OLED. Innocn&rsquo;s cover and kickstand falls short, but we suspect many people would rather pocket the savings and buy their own third-party stand.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-look-for-in-a-portable-monitor">What to look for in a portable monitor</h2>



<p>Many of the features we look for in a desktop monitor also apply to a portable monitor. A portable monitor should have a bright, sharp image with a decent contrast ratio, wide color gamut, and great color accuracy. The differences between portable monitors and their desktop brethren are more often found in their design, build quality, and connectivity.</p>



<h3 id="image-quality">Image quality</h3>



<p>Most portable monitors have image quality similar to desktop monitors in the same price bracket. Portable monitors tend to score well in brightness and sharpness, but color and contrast are often lacking. OLED portable monitors perform significantly better than less expensive IPS LCD displays. Unfortunately, they&rsquo;re much more expensive.</p>



<p>Numerous small brands have jumped into the portable monitor market in recent years and quality control can be an issue. We recommend sticking to monitors that are known to achieve high marks in image quality (otherwise, be prepared to use a retailer&rsquo;s return policy).</p>



<h3 id="stands-kickstands-and-covers">Stands, kickstands, and covers</h3>



<p>Portable monitors ship with a bundled kickstand or stand that is used to keep the monitor propped up and steady on a desk.</p>



<p>Unlike desktop monitors, where most stands are more or less identical, the stands used by portable monitors vary. Some have a simple kickstand that attaches magnetically, while others use a clip-on case. A rare few, like the ViewSonic ColorPro VP16-OLED, have a folding stand that provides significant height and kickstand adjustment.</p>



<h3 id="connectivity">Connectivity</h3>



<p>Connectivity is key. A portable monitor that lacks the port you need to connect your tablet or laptop is useless.</p>



<p>Most portable monitors offer the option to connect over USB, a video input (usually HDMI), or both, but the number of ports available and the standards used vary widely. We look for monitors that offer a healthy selection of ports. We also prefer monitors that can be powered over USB-C by a connected desktop or laptop.</p>



<h3 id="portability-size-and-weight">Portability, size, and weight</h3>



<p>Our final consideration is the most obvious: portability. Most portable monitors live up to their name with an included kickstand case or cover that can fold flat and protect the display while it&rsquo;s stowed.</p>



<p>Still, the exact size and weight of a portable monitor is important, and shoppers may need to accept trade-offs between weight and quality. A top-notch pick like the Viewsonic ColorPro VP16-OLED can offer superior durability, but a lightweight budget pick like the Azorpa A1 Gamut might be preferable if you&rsquo;ll be hauling a portable monitor daily.</p>



<h2 id="how-we-test-monitors">How we test monitors</h2>



<p>PCWorld&rsquo;s monitor evaluations stem from the expertise of freelance and staff contributors with decades of collective experience. Although our initial impressions rely on our eyes, we rigorously test each monitor using a SpyderXElite color calibration tool for a comprehensive analysis.</p>



<p>This device helps us objectively measure a variety of monitor attributes including brightness, contrast, color gamut, color accuracy, luminance and color uniformity, and gamma, among other traits.</p>



<p>We also rely on hands-on testing to judge the quality, size, and weight of a portable monitor. Every monitor we recommend is personally tested first-hand by a PCWorld contributor. This helps us pick out flaws in build quality and portability that separate the best and worst portable monitors.&nbsp;</p>
