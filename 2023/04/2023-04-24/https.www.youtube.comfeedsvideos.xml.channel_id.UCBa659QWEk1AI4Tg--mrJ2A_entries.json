How do they keep it safe? And, as a side note, just how loud is it when you're standing next to a fighter jet?\n\n(Bonus things that didn't fit into the video: the aircraft aren't stored in hangars, but in caverns tunneled into the hillside! And if you want to get really close to the jets, there's a second, much narrower crossing over a taxiway to the caverns. They're not taking off at high speed there, though.)\n\nCamera: Tobias Buchmann\nEditor: Julian Domanski\nLocal production by Viven https://viven.ch\n\nI'm at https://tomscott.com\non Twitter at https://twitter.com/tomscott\non Facebook at https://facebook.com/tomscott\nand on Instagram as tomscottgo", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPaQInkWV7g", "date_published": "2023-04-24 15:00:35+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
