There's some management reshuffling happening at Guerrilla Games, and in the announcement they may have possibly teased the next Horizon game. The latest DLC, The Burning Shores, and the PSVR2-exclusive Call of the Mountain, may have just come out, but Guerrilla mentioned something about the next Aloy adventure. Sneaky confirmation? Let us know your thoughts in the comments. In Diablo news, Diablo IV is getting one last beta test. It'll be free and open to the public, but be prepared for long queues, as this beta is going to stress test the game's servers. Completely unrelated, the International Red Cross Society wants gamers to follow the Geneva Conventions. They are challenging players of popular shooters to try and follow the established Rules of War, and a few streamers are rising to the occasion. And speaking of shooters, the new Call of Duty has been announced...but it's not a video game. What is it? Watch to find out!

With the super smashing success of the Super Mario Bros. movie at the box office, it should be no surprise that Nintendo would be thinking about capitalizing on it with a sequel. But according to the legend himself, Shigeru Miyamoto, the video game company has plans beyond a sequel. The question is, what’s the logical next step for Nintendo regarding movies and TV after #Mario? What’s next for Nintendo after the #MarioMovie? Miyamoto weighs in on what’s next for Nintendo. And while Nintendo’s winning on the big screen, Sega’s priming itself for streaming with new casting for its Knuckles live-action series. All this and more on today’s fix with Akeem Lawanson.

Check out the new trailer for White Men Can't Jump, an upcoming comedy movie starring Sinqua Walls, Jack Harlow, Teyana Taylor, Laura Harrier, Vince Staples, Myles Bullock, and Lance Reddick.

White Men Can’t Jump is a modern retelling of the iconic 1992 film that celebrates the streetball hustling culture of Los Angeles. Sinqua Walls stars as Kamal, once a promising player who derailed his future in the sport, and multi-platinum rap superstar Jack Harlow makes his movie debut as Jeremy, a former star of the game whose injuries stalled his own career. Juggling tenuous relationships, financial pressures and serious internal struggles, the two ballers—opposites who are seemingly miles apart—find they might have more in common than they imagined possible.

The film is written by Kenya Barris and Doug Hall. “White Men Can’t Jump” is produced by Kenya Barris and Paul Hall; it’s executive produced by Blake Griffin, Ryan Kalil, Noah Weinstein, Calmatic, Doug Hall, E. Brian Dobbins and James Powers.

White Men Can't Jump, directed by Calmatic, begins streaming on May 19, 2023, exclusively on Hulu in the U.S., Star+ in Latin America, and Disney+ under the Star banner in all other territories.

Sisu reviewed by Matt Donato. Opens in US theaters on April 28, 2023.

Sisu wages a hellacious war against familiar fascist henchmen with an added boost of against-all-odds adrenaline. Jalmari Helander proves that killing Nazis never goes out of style – as long as you're willing to hit as hard as Sisu. Actor Jorma Tommila rages against a hateful German machine as Aatami Korpi with a heroicness fit for fable-like boogyman fantasies passed from one generation to the next. Helander keeps it simple and cranks the dial on intensity to produce an action-packed World War II epic that thrives on a smaller yet still decadent scale of destruction. We praise a tale of impossible might, unlimited mayhem, and a Nazi body count that sure isn't stingy.

Build pens and take care of adorable creatures, like capybara, in Green Hell's Animal Husbandry update, available now on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Watch the trailer for this update, which allows you to tame and breed animals from the survival game Green Hell. The update also brings new features and quality-of-life improvements, such as those from the Name Your Pet Update and the Plant Naming patch.

In Green Hell's Animal Husbandry update, you can use the new blowpipe weapon to hunt capybara, peccary, and tapir safely putting them to sleep in order to keep them within pens, which are able to be built at your bases. Care for them, earn their trust, feed them, clean their living quarters, and maybe—if you have both a male and female in captivity—you’ll be able to breed them, as well. And of course, you can pet your newfound friends. Further to that, you can also use the blowpipe as a defense against other animal and human enemies by immobilizing the threat either immediately or over time based on your target’s size.
