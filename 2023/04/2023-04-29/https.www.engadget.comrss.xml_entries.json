[{"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Elon Musk says Twitter will introduce per-article charging in May", "description": "<p>Twitter might provide publishers with a new way to earn from their content outside of the typical recurring subscription option. According to company chief Elon Musk, Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1652349875017879552\">will allow</a> media publishers to charge users for access to individual articles they post on the website as as soon as next month. Users will end up paying a higher per-article price than what the cost of access to every article would amount to if they had a subscription instead. But Musk said it's for those who want to read the occasional story from a specific outlet, so each article probably wouldn't cost as much as a monthly subscription.&nbsp;</p><div id=\"a147009a612e466abf5cb927cb7e1605\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Rolling out next month, this platform will allow media publishers to charge users on a per article basis with one click.<br /><br />This enables users who would not sign up for a monthly subscription to pay a higher per article price for when they want to read an occasional article.\u2026</p>\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1652349875017879552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 29, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>At this point in time, though, details about the upcoming feature remain vague. Musk only said that it will start rolling out next month \u2014 it's unclear what kinds of accounts and media outlets will be able to offer per-article charging. In addition, Twitter's owner didn't say how much the website would be taking as commission. When the company officially replaced Super Follows with Subscriptions, Musk announced that it <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-replaces-super-follows-with-subscriptions-203711756.html\">won't be taking any money</a> from creators for the next 12 months. After the year is up, Twitter will be <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/twitter-take-10-cut-content-subscriptions-after-12-months-2023-04-28/\">taking a 10 percent cut</a> on subscriptions.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Engadget has reached out to the website for clarification, but it doesn't have a press team anymore. We'll have to wait for more information to know if Twitter will implement the same rule for per-article payments. Ultimately, the company will be taking a cut \u2014 Twitter, under Musk, has been introducing more and more paid features to boost revenue. It's pretty common knowledge at this point that its verification badge now comes as a perk for its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-blue-subscriptions-are-now-available-worldwide-211835305.html\">$8-a-month Blue subscription</a>. Twitter also shut down its free API to launch a new one that users would have to pay for. It would cost enterprise customers almost $50,000 a month to access the new API, so some organizations and companies such as <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nycs-transport-authority-will-no-longer-post-service-alerts-on-twitter-051701441.html\">NYC's transport authority</a> had chosen to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-removes-twitter-from-its-social-media-tool-for-advertisers-051717547.html\">end Twitter integration</a> or to leave the website instead.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-says-twitter-will-introduce-per-article-charging-in-may-230739305.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-says-twitter-will-introduce-per-article-charging-in-may-230739305.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-29 23:07:39+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Apple drops lawsuit against former exec who accused company of spying", "description": "<p>After more than three years of litigation, Apple has quietly dropped its lawsuit against Gerard Williams III, the former chip executive the company accused of poaching employees.

When the tech giant first sued Williams, it accused him of \u201csecretly\u201d starting Nuvia and recruiting talent for his startup while he was still an Apple employee. Williams disputed Apple\u2019s claims and accused the company of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-10-apple-lawsuit-snooped-text-messages.html\"><ins>spying on his text messages</ins></a>.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>As <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-29/apple-drops-suit-against-ex-chip-exec-williams-who-started-nuvia?sref=10lNAhZ9\"><ins>reported by </ins><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a>, Apple filed a request to dismiss the suit against Williams earlier this week. The document does not state the company\u2019s reason for dropping the case. However, it does say Apple did so \u201cwith prejudice,\u201d meaning it cannot file the same claim against Williams again. It also suggests the two sides came to a settlement. Apple did not immediately respond to Engadget\u2019s comment request.</p><p>In the weeks leading up to Wednesday\u2019s dismissal request, court documents show Apple sought the recusal of Judge Sunil Kulkarni. Around March 17th, 2023, the company added two lawyers from the legal firm <a href=\"https://www.mofo.com/\"><ins>Morrison and Foerster</ins></a> to the team litigating its case against Williams. On March 28th, Judge Sunil Kulkarni <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=cc8a75f0-b695-4a6a-a33c-41019f4bfaa4&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Scribd&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjYzhhNzVmMC1iNjk1LTRhNmEtYTMzYy00MTAxOWY0YmZhYTQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2NyaWJkLmNvbS9kb2N1bWVudC82NDE2ODkxMzgvSnVkZ2UtS3Vsa2FybmktZGlzY2xvc3VyZSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMGI5ZTdmZGMtNjU1OC00MDZhLTkzNjEtM2QzZDYyZjMyNzNjIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAS2q32ApmLH1e72mnoW6Ie8Yycpow3cDy9edA6Hf3NCT&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fdocument%2F641689138%2FJudge-Kulkarni-disclosure\">filed a brief disclosing</a> that he had worked at Morrison and Foerster for approximately 13 years and had kept in contact \u201cover the years\u201d with <a href=\"https://www.mofo.com/people/bryan-wilson\"><ins>Bryan Wilson</ins></a> and <a href=\"https://www.mofo.com/people/kenneth-kuwayti\"><ins>Ken Kuwayti</ins></a>, the two \u201cMoFo\u201d attorneys Apple hired on as counsel earlier in the month.</p><p>\u201cI have occasional social interactions with them (e.g., bimonthly lunches, seeing them at parties of mutual friends, and so on),\u201d Judge Kulkarni wrote. \u201cI believe I have recused myself from past cases involving Mr. Wilson and/or Mr. Kuwayti, but solely as a prophylactic measure.\u201d After learning of the involvement of his former colleagues, Judge Kulkarni held an \u201cinformal\u201d meeting with the two sides where he said he was \u201cleaning toward recusal\u201d if Apple retained the counsel of either Wilson or Kuwayti. In that same meeting, Kulkarni says he told Apple and Williams his recusal from the case would likely mean a delay in the case going to trial.

It then argues it was Apple that introduced a potential conflict of interest to the case.</p><p>\u201cEven if a conflict existed that <em>might </em>warrant recusal, the procedure imposed by the Court \u2013 allowing the party that introduced the \u2018conflict\u2019 and would theoretically stand to benefit from it \u2013 to decide whether to waive it is inconsistent with basic rules of fairness and due process,\u201d the brief concludes. \u201cSuch a procedure would set a dangerous precedent for judge shopping in the middle of a case: any part, at any time, could recruit former colleagues of a sitting judge and then force his or her recusal.\u201d</p><p>Putting together what happened after that point is more difficult. However, after the 6th, the court in Santa Clara held multiple hearings where no one from either side appeared. Apple then filed to dismiss the case on April 26th. Qualcomm, Williams' current employer, did not immediately respond to Engadget's request for comment.&nbsp;</p><div id=\"c6602dd791a4476c813630650a059303\"><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-top: 45px;\"></div></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apple-drops-lawsuit-against-former-exec-who-accused-company-of-spying-211547595.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/apple-drops-lawsuit-against-former-exec-who-accused-company-of-spying-211547595.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-29 21:15:47+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Leaked Google Pixel Fold images show a sleek, nearly gapless hinge", "description": "<p>With <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-io-2023-takes-place-on-may-10th-in-front-of-a-limited-in-person-audience-232154501.html\"><ins>Google I/O less</ins></a> than two weeks away, the Pixel leaks are starting to come hard and fast.
