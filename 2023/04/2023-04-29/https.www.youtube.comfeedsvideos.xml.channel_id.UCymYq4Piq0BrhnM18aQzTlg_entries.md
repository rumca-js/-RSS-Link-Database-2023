Buy one at Walmart - https://lon.tv/cu4nx (compensated affiliate link) - Walmart refreshed their popular $20 4k streaming box which now runs an updated version of Android with the new Google TV interface. While it packs a lot of value but has some rough edges in need of firmware fixes. See more TV boxes: http://lon.tv/settopbox and subscribe! http://lon.tv/s
