The 10-day Shanghai International Auto Show opened on April 18th, 2023. Tesla, America’s largest electric car company, didn't attend. As it turns out, it was a smart move by Tesla.  It learned its lesson from the 2021 Auto Show. This time, it’s BMW's turn to be unlucky.
 the CCP is no longer able to give Germany a larger market. It basically has no more cards to pull Germany's strings. And the political and security differences between the two countries are becoming increasingly obvious. In addition, for a long time, the CCP has used patriotism to make the public form a xenophobic mindset and sentiment. 
This has led to the emergence of more war wolves, large and small, who have brought about the chaos that is beyond the control of the CCP.
