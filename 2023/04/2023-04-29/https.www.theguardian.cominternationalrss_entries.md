## Manchester City are magnificent but struggle to match thrills of United’s treble| Jonathan Wilson

<p>A brilliant team are demolishing even closest rivals and can make history. But glory lies in drama as well as excellence</p><p>Manchester City are brilliant. They can win games with and without the ball. They can stifle teams with possession or eviscerate them on the counter. They can produce moments of breathtaking combination play but also have in Erling Haaland a centre-forward with a set of attributes, physical and technical, that has been seen only perhaps half a dozen times before. They are magnificent and seemingly on course for a treble. They are also a symptom of the financial structures that are destroying the game football was once understood to be.</p><p>The naive and the wilfully blind will say there have been dominant teams before, but not like this there haven’t. Assuming City do go on to win the Premier League, this will be the third time in English history a club have won five titles in six seasons: Liverpool did it between 1979 and 1984 and Manchester United between 1996 and 2001.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/apr/29/manchester-city-are-magnificent-but-struggle-to-match-thrills-of-uniteds-treble">Continue reading...</a>

## Blown it? Four things Arsenal must do to stay in the title race

<p>Has Manchester City’s 4-1 win wrapped up the Premier League? Perhaps not if Mikel Arteta and his players can hang in there</p><p>Arsenal’s defensive problems in the absence of William Saliba are little secret. They have conceded 2.17 goals a game without the centre-back; with him, that figure reads 0.93. Arguably they have missed Takehiro Tomiyasu in equal measure: he has been injured since mid-March, like Saliba, and could have slotted in at centre-back, taken on bespoke defensive tasks at left-back or, perhaps most attractively, been fielded at right-back to allow Ben White a move inside.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/29/blown-it-four-things-arsenal-must-do-to-stay-in-the-title-race">Continue reading...</a>

## Packer’s gritty leadership shores up nervy England at just the right time | Sarah Rendell

<p>Red Roses captain pivotal in quelling French revival and winning her first Six Nations title since taking the role</p><p>Ribcages shook as the baseline dropped. Boom. Boom. Boom. The vibrations matched the march of the teams coming out. Fireworks blasted red and white into the sky and Taylor Swift’s familiar voice sang: “Are you ready for it?” The world record crowd definitely were and it is a good job Twickenham does not have a roof or it would need repairing as these teams are used to breaking the glass ceiling.<br /><br />England rugby’s reputation needed some patching at their home, given that the last time a team frequented this grass the men were booed off after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/11/england-france-six-nations-rugby-union-match-report">being destroyed by France in March</a>. If you looked hard enough the cracks in the concrete were still evident, the fortress crumbling at the seams.</p><p>Seven weeks to the day and Twickenham was hosting England v France again but this time it was not just the pyrotechnics bringing the fire with the hosts, and particularly their captain, Marlie Packer, lighting up the pitch in their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/apr/29/england-france-womens-six-nations-rugby-union-match-report">grand-slam winning match</a>.<br /><br />Packer is relatively new to the job. She captained the team for the first time against South Africa at the World Cup last October, but she now embodies the role as if she has had it for years. The foundations of a team are sometimes shaken when leadership changes, but that has not been a worry for England. Sarah Hunter, England’s all-time appearance record holder, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/25/tearful-middleton-hails-sarah-hunter-as-the-greatest-england-player-of-all-time">retired after the Red Roses’ opening match</a> in this year’s tournament and left huge boots to fill. The transition to Packer, though, has been seamless and it is not only her leadership qualities that have had her grabbing attention.<br /><br />She led the defence as the ocean blue of French shirts barraged England early on, with the player of the match, Sadia Kabeya, and Hannah Botterman among those saving the Red Roses. Packer turned the ball over and it proved to be the difference after the French revolution in the second half. If France had scored in the early stages would they have gone on to win? An eventuality never to be known thanks to the white-wall defence.<br /><br />The flash of the No 7 over the tryline is almost expected when England play and Packer ensured it happened again as she weaved her way to the line in the 25th minute. It was her seventh of the championship, making her the first forward since 2020 to win the Women’s Six Nations top try-scorer award (the England backrow Poppy Cleall jointly held the title three years ago).<br /><br />Packer’s prowess was evident with her try celebration – she jumped up with her fists clenched and roared. Her territorial cry seemed to shake France, so much so that Packer was belted into submission off the ball. The crowd collectively held their breath as she took a knee after the hit. They had seen Packer go down and stay down against Ireland but this time a deafening cheer rippled around the ground as she rose to her feet.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/apr/29/marlie-packer-england-france-rugby-six-nations-leadership-captain">Continue reading...</a>

## Gretchen Parlato and Lionel Loueke: Lean In review – a winning partnership between old friends

<p>(Edition)<br />The American singer and Benin guitarist join forces on a languid mix of bossa nova, power ballads – and Foo Fighters</p><p><a href="https://gretchenparlato.com/">Gretchen Parlato</a>’s previous album, 2021’s <em>Flor</em>, saw her widely acclaimed as the outstanding jazz voice of the times. After several years when her career was put on hold for motherhood, <em>Flor</em> was a remarkable comeback, an alluring mix of Brazilian samba and chamber cello, with Parlato’s featherlight vocals skipping between Bach and Bowie’s posthumous <em>No Plan</em>. <em>Lean In</em> is less musically adventurous but equally winning, a partnership with the well-travelled Benin guitarist <a href="https://www.lionellouekemusic.com/">Lionel Loueke</a>, best known for his work with Herbie Hancock; the pair are old friends, fellow travellers ascending through New York’s jazz hierarchy.</p><p>It’s a spare, almost languid set, driven by effortlessly funky codas from Loueke’s guitar, with some discreet percussion by <a href="https://www.markguiliana.com/index">Mark Guiliana</a> (Parlato’s husband). Vocal duties are swapped and shared. There are dreamy Brazilian echoes of Astrud Gilberto and Carlos Jobim on Astronauta, a Brazilian standard from the bossa nova era, but the palette is wide, embracing west Africa, R&amp;B – I Miss You, an 80s power ballad by Klymaxx – and even a Foo Fighters cover. Loueke provides vocal yips and clicks, Parlato sings with unshowy elan, always sensuous and involving, while the duo’s joint vocals on opener Akwe are positively joyous. A treat.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/29/gretchen-parlato-and-lionel-loueke-lean-in-review-a-winning-partnership-between-old-friends">Continue reading...</a>

## From 2-10 to contenders: how the LA Lakers turned around a hellish season

<p>A Lakers team given only a 0.3% chance of making the playoffs a few months ago has the look of a deadly serious contender in a wide-open Western Conference after toppling the Grizzlies</p><p>“Do you ever amaze – or surprise – yourself?” LeBron James was asked following the Lakers’ thrilling Game 4 overtime win in Los Angeles on Monday, which gave the team a commanding three-games-to-one lead in their first-round playoff series against the Memphis Grizzlies. “Yup,” James replied succinctly. Indeed, recording his first ever 20-point, 20-rebound game on one fully functioning foot, at age 38 (making him the oldest player to ever do so), and in the playoffs no less, was pretty amazing.</p><p>But seeing James and the rest of his Lakers cohort topple the odds can hardly continue to be considered a “surprise”. It’s what they’ve been doing all year long: clawing back from an abysmal 2-10 start to an above-.500 finish, and ending a tumultuous regular season – which many believed would have James’ <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/08/lebron-james-tribute-scoring-record-kareem-abdul-jabbar">breaking of the scoring record in February</a> as its sole highlight – as the No 7 seed in the Western Conference.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/apr/29/los-angeles-lakers-season-turnaround-contenders">Continue reading...</a>

## Can biometrics help NFL teams spot the next Brock Purdy?

<p>An ex-Marine turned analytics wonk is using biomechanical data to help teams find the NFL draft’s diamonds in the rough</p><p><br />As the NFL draft winds down on Saturday and the rookie free agent signing period kicks off, teams are on the clock to find the next Brock Purdy. San Francisco closed last year’s show after taking the 23-year-old quarterback with the 262nd and final pick on the board, a distinction that comes with the unfortunate nickname Mr Irrelevant. But when franchise QBs Jimmy Garoppolo and Trey Lance were both knocked out late last season, it fell to the Iowa State product to keep the 49ers’ playoff fortunes alive. All he did was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/19/brock-purdy-san-francisco-49ers-quarterback-nfl-playoffs-football-dallas-cowboys">win his first seven starts</a> and lead San Francisco to the NFC championship game while posting the best rookie passer rating since Kurt Warner’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/24/american-underdog-all-madden-nfl-christmas">Cinderella Super Bowl run</a>.</p><p>Now that Purdy has the 49ers moving on from Garoppolo and cooling on the idea of moving ahead with Lance (the enigmatic 2021 third overall draft selection that came at a significant cost to the team’s <a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/49ers-acquire-no-3-overall-pick-from-dolphins-miami-gets-no-12-pick-two-future-f">long-term future</a>), pro talent evaluators are rushing to point out how, actually, they had Purdy pegged all along as Mr <em>Relevant</em>. Never mind if Steve Gara is among the few people who can say he saw clear signs of Purdy’s future success. “Even though he was in plain sight, to the NFL community, he was a hidden gem,” Gara says.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/apr/29/nfl-draft-breakaway-biometrics-brock-purdy">Continue reading...</a>
