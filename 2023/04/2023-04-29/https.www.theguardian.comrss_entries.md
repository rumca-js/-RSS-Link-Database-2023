Led by a mercurial, near-perfect display from their new captain, George Williams, one of a handful of survivors from last year’s World Cup, they scored 11 tries. It was difficult to fully judge quite how impressive England were given the calibre of the opposition. France, unable to call on a number of high-profile players due to injury and withdrawals, were no match.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/apr/29/england-france-rugby-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

Patrick Brammall and Harriet Dyer’s comedy nails the alchemy of what turns the private into the hilariously relatable<p>I realise this says more about me, but my instinctive response to hearing about a real-life couple doing a comedy show together is usually a rapid sinking of the heart. It’s a scepticism born of too many evenings with coupled-up friends who collapse into spasms of laughter every time someone says “couscous”, and then pretend-apologise by exchanging a special glance and saying: “Sorry, it’s hard to explain, it’s just… we have a thing about couscous.” Yes, hilarious.</p><p>Frequently, what couples find funny together fails to translate outside that context, and can often feel exclusionary – which, after all, is the point of a private joke: this is our thing, you wouldn’t get it because you weren’t there. So the prospect of that in sitcom form doesn’t inspire confidence.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/29/couples-jokes-so-irritating-not-so-in-colin-from-accounts">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The author of Original Sins, an account of addiction and shame, on his book’s impact on his evangelical parents, reading the Patrick Melrose series while waiting for drug dealers, and how looking middle class saved him from arrest</p><p>Matt Rowland Hill, 38, is the author of <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/original-sins-9781529113174">Original Sins</a></em>, about growing up as the son of a baptist minister before falling into a decade-long addiction to heroin while studying at Oxford. Out in paperback, it was longlisted for last year’s Baillie Gifford prize for nonfiction while being praised by Geoff Dyer for its “novelistic virtues of vivid scene-making, fully realised characterisation and psychological subtlety”. Hill and I sat in a park near his home in east London.</p><p><strong>I might have read this as a novel had it not been subtitled “a memoir”.</strong><br />The subtitle wasn’t my choice: I was open to it being published as fiction if my publisher had wanted that. I approached it like a novel, thinking about point of view and how I’d produce moments of irony and humour, which maybe liberated me to write with an emotional distance that paradoxically allowed me to be more honest. Nothing is fabricated. I did go to psychiatric units. I was a heroin addict for all that time. I used my imagination to make vivid the bits of dialogue or details about what we were wearing, although it’s surprising how detailed your recollections are once you dig in; what my father told my mother on that car ride to Guernsey – “If you died tonight, I’d dance on your <em>grave</em>” – was scored into my childhood memory.</p><p><em>Original Sins</em> by Matt Rowland Hill is published in paperback on 4 May by Vintage (£10.99).

My mother’s contribution to perhaps the most overlooked British folk art of the past 90 years: the canvas-work church kneeler<p>It’s probably too soon to suggest, as the Rev Richard Coles recently did, that Elizabeth Bingham’s <em>Kneelers</em> is the best non-fiction book of 2023. But, like him, I’m a little in love with this guide to the most practised (and overlooked) British folk art of the past 90 years. Bingham is an authority on Anglican church canvas-work kneelers, and in her lovely book she traces their history from their beginnings in 1930s Winchester, through their zenith after the coronation of Elizabeth II, to the present day, in which a dedicated few keep the tradition alive.</p><p>Kneelers celebrate and memorialise every aspect of life, not only the religious – though Bible stories do feature, if you’re in the market for a tapestry of Jonah and the whale – and this makes them both touching and surprising. My favourites so far: a grey whippet (St Peter and St Paul, Deddington); a Second World War ARP warden fighting a fire (St Mary Magdalene, Woodstock); Sizewell nuclear power station in the sunshine (St Edmunds, Southwold).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/29/notebook-taking-the-knees-in-jerusalem">Continue reading...</a>

<p>While politics as usual dominates the Commons, thankfully a few people from the upper chamber are thinking about the big picture</p><p>The most interesting TV I’ve watched recently did not come from a conventional television channel, nor even from Netflix, but from TV coverage of parliament. It was a <a href="https://parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/8538a3b7-3c5c-4867-8360-af7246bfca8f">recording</a> of a meeting of the <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/646/ai-in-weapon-systems-committee/news/186511/how-should-autonomous-weapons-be-developed-used-and-regulated/">AI in weapons systems select committee</a> of the House of Lords, which was set up to inquire into “how should autonomous weapons be developed, used and regulated”. The particular session I was interested in was the one held on 20 April, during which the committee heard from four expert witnesses – Kenneth Payne, who is professor of strategy at King’s College London; Keith Dear, director of artificial intelligence innovation at the computer company Fujitsu; James Black from the defence and security research group of Rand Europe; and Courtney Bowman, global director of privacy and civil liberties engineering at Palantir UK. An interesting mix, I thought – and so it turned out to be.</p><p>Autonomous weapons systems are ones that can select and attack a target without human intervention. It is believed (and not just by their boosters) that these systems could revolutionise warfare, and may be faster, more accurate and more resilient than existing weapons systems. And that they could, conceivably, even limit the casualties of war (though I’ll believe that when I see it).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/29/thank-the-lords-someone-is-worried-about-ai-controlled-weapons-systems">Continue reading...</a>

## Rodeo review – a full-throttle French rite-of-passage drama

<p>Lola Quivoron’s gritty debut feature, largely using non-actors, follows a disaffected young female dirt biker who forces her way into this male-dominated subculture</p><p>The first time we meet motorbike fanatic Julia (Julie Ledru), she is temporarily without wheels. Lashing out indiscriminately, at war with everything, it’s as though she is trying to tear her way out of the frame. And the camera is only slightly less agitated than she is. It doesn’t take her long to steal another motorbike. And once she does, both Julia and the cinematography take on a different character. The camera grows wings and soars, fluidity replacing the jerkiness of the earlier scenes. And Julia laughs with pleasure, billowing hair full of grit and exhaust fumes. For a while at least, before a jarring third-act climax, the protagonist and the film-making keep pace with each other perfectly.</p><p>Julia’s wild streak and her thief’s cunning have estranged her from her family, but these traits earn the grudging respect of a team of urban rodeo riders – asphalt outlaws who pull high-speed stunts in illicit meet-ups. It’s an ultra-macho world, populated by youths with Rizla-thin skins who are threatened by a woman in their number. Julia meets their aggression with fists and fury.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/29/rodeo-review-lola-quivoron-julie-ledru-a-full-throttle-french-rite-of-passage-drama-motorbike-dirt-bike">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Advice comes despite charity’s warning that social media figure is fuelling shocking growth of misogyny in schools</p><p>Teachers are being advised by the government not to discuss social media influencer Andrew Tate, the “king of toxic masculinity”, with pupils – despite schools reporting a rising tide of misogyny and sexual harassment from boys as young as nine.</p><p>One small charity, Diversify, based in Rotherham, which runs school workshops about inclusion, receives about 25 calls a week from primary and secondary schools across England who want help dealing with sexual harassment and “shocking misogynistic incidents”.

<p><strong>Coliseum; St Martin-in-the-Fields, London</strong><br />A potent US tale of Black lives hits home with fervour and humanity at ENO. Plus shock and roar from John Eliot Gardiner at 80</p><p>Time was when Simon Rattle, a Liverpool lad good at playing drums, thought his destiny was to be a conductor. His main challenge, on top of mastering the task, would be to prise open the ears of know-what-I-like audiences. Instead, he has found himself the unofficially anointed only begotten saviour of the entire art form we call British classical music. It is an onerous burden. Five decades on, he alone guarantees headlines and column inches on issues that matter to the industry. We should be grateful he fights on.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/24/simon-rattle-barbican-speech-we-are-facing-a-fight-for-existence-uk-classical-music-cuts">In a speech from the platform</a> (last Sunday, at a London Symphony Orchestra concert at the Barbican, issued as a media statement after), Rattle made his most urgent appeal yet: that those with power, specifically the BBC and Arts Council England, without any coherent plan, stop cutting away “at the flesh of our culture”. Lurking behind his words is the implication that whatever reprise BBC musicians or English National Opera have now, it is likely to be temporary. After the Proms, who knows? This is a battle for classical music’s survival.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/29/blue-eno-coliseum-london-jeanine-tesori-tinuke-craig-review-b-minor-mass-john-eliot-gardiner-80-st-martin-in-the-fields-monteverdi-choir-english-baroque-soloists-simon-rattle-speech-barbican">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The British conductor and the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra record a revelatory performance of Holst’s ‘mood pictures’, while the guitarist-tenor duo cross continents and genres on the atmospheric Broken Branches</p><p>• Gustav Holst liked to speak of his seven-movement orchestral suite <strong>The Planets</strong>, Op 32 (1918) as a series of musical “mood pictures”. Whatever his theories about the individual planets – and as a student of astrology he had a few – the variety of musical styles in his work is remarkable. This is demonstrated in a superb new recording by the choir and orchestra of the <strong>Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra</strong> (<a href="https://www.prestomusic.com/classical/products/9464694--holst-the-planets">BR Klassik</a>), conducted by <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/03/conductor-daniel-harding-air-france-pilot">Daniel Harding</a></strong>. From the menace of Mars, bringer of war, to the serene beauty of Venus, the mix of jollity and nobility in Jupiter, the unworldly sadness of Saturn and the pianissimo dissonance of Neptune, this is a revelatory performance.</p><p>Horns and woodwind are expressive, strings lithe, the layers of wordless high voices perfectly blended. Harding was announced as Antonio Pappano’s successor as music director of Rome’s Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia after this disc was pressed. Lucky Italians. The British conductor, heard more abroad than at home, is a force to reckon with. If you thought you knew this most popular work inside out, give the Bavarians’ account a listen.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/29/holst-the-planets-bavarian-radio-symphony-orchestra-daniel-harding-review-sean-shibe-karim-sulayman-broken-branches-ryan-wigglesworth-gotterdammerung-bbc-scottish-symphony-orchestra">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The deadpan YouTuber went from quizzing grime stars over wings to Vanity Fair’s Oscars party red carpet. What happens now she’s becoming as famous as the people she interviews?</p><p>“You’re about to get on to the red carpet for one of the most exclusive awards ceremonies of the year!” a voice booms. “It’s showtime!” It looks more like Amelia Dimoldenberg and I are walking down a dark corridor; this isn’t Hollywood, but London’s Madame Tussauds. “Is that a real person?” she jumps as we pass a plastic paparazzo. Then a human photographer fawns over us as if we were real stars. Except … “Oh my goodness, it’s you!” he giggles, overcome. Is this still a bit? Or has the presence of an actual celeb melted Madame’s waxy fourth wall?</p><p>It’s the latter. He wants a photo – but his camera is fake and he has no phone. “How would you take it then?!” says Dimoldenberg, bemused. At least the fake photographer gets to experience her trademark sharp-shooting. As host of the comedy interview series <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyQ-DUV6lZgoL8wiPusYiUg" title="">Chicken Shop Date</a> (CSD), Dimoldenberg takes celebrities out for nuggets, purportedly on her quest for true love, although her exaggerated awkwardness doesn’t exactly make for traditional romance. “So, how do you sext?” she asks Ed Sheeran in one episode. (“Wow. In person.”) To rapper Fuse ODG: “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxvAsSKok9I">Did you have dreams of being an electrician</a>?” And, infamously, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gnwr8x-W_fY">Can you remember any of the rap that you did</a>?” to Louis Theroux.

(The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gnwr8x-W_fY" title="">Theroux episode</a> of CSD has now been viewed 11m times.) “As someone who’s always been so interested in pop culture, to be part of a big pop culture moment like that was really amazing,” says Dimoldenberg.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/apr/29/amelia-dimoldenberg-interview-chicken-shop-date-oscars-red-carpet">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When the queen died last year, republicans balked at the fawning response to the succession. Some even found themselves under arrest for minor acts of protest, such as heckling. Ahead of next week’s coronation, three tell their tales</p><p>Symon Hill was walking back from church on a sunny autumn Sunday when he realised his route was blocked; the roads around Carfax Tower in Oxford were closed off. It was 11 September, the day after Charles Windsor had been officially proclaimed King Charles III in London, and local events were being held nationwide. This ceremony, organised by the council, typified the pomp and pageantry. Hill is a quiet, thoughtful man of 46, but it doesn’t take much to rile him when it comes to the monarchy. He was looking forward to spending the afternoon relaxing with his housemates in their garden, and now he was stuck in a celebration he regarded as archaic and irrelevant.</p><p>Hill is a Christian, historian, pacifist, teacher, writer, activist and republican. At the start of the ceremony, which focused on the queen’s death, he was silent: “I wouldn’t interrupt somebody’s grief.” But when “they declared Charles rightful liege lord, and acknowledged our obedience to him as our only king”, Hill had heard enough. “I find this language very demeaning, and I called out ‘Who elected him?’” To his astonishment, he found himself surrounded by security, arrested and eventually charged under the Public Order Act 1986.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/29/the-crowd-were-saying-kill-him-kick-him-to-death-what-happened-to-the-people-who-protested-against-king-charles">Continue reading...</a>

In <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/dec/10/matilda-musical-review" title="">2010, there was Matilda</a>, the planet-devouring omni-smash, which flourished in the West End, on Broadway and on family car journeys, transforming Minchin from an anarchic musical comedian who could fill a good-sized room at the Edinburgh festival into a feted and wealthy man.<strong> </strong>“I mean, <em>Matilda</em>, fuck,” is all the loquacious Minchin can say about that show’s successes for now.

<p>After being forced to quit social media, political journalist<em> </em>Rafael Behr was able to see its corrosive influence clearly. How can we repair the damage caused by a system that plays on our worst impulses?</p><p>In the first weeks of my convalescence I developed a capacity for time travel. I had to spend a lot of time in bed and, floating on the edge of wakefulness, half-conscious, I discovered I could explore scenes from my past in exquisite detail. I wondered if it was a side effect of my various medications and whether it would be permanent. It was almost hallucinogenic and not unpleasant. I couldn’t replay whole scenes from my youth, but I was able to transport myself back to old places – only interiors. I could feel the contours of the Artex on the walls of my childhood home in the late 70s. I could smell the damp on the charcoal-coloured carpet in the living room of the flat I rented with friends when I left university.</p><p>I could explore these spaces with fingertip precision, inch by inch. I remembered the angles of door handles and the action on light switches.</p><p>In an information-rich world, the wealth of information means a dearth of something else: a scarcity of whatever it is that information consumes. What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/29/antisocial-how-putting-away-my-phone-helped-me-recover-from-a-heart-attack">Continue reading...</a>

The under-20 national team reached the final of the Asian Championship in March to qualify for this summer’s World Cup in Argentina, where they are drawn with England, Uruguay and Tunisia. In January, the country hosted and won the Gulf Cup, an eight-nation regional tournament, lifting the trophy in front of 60,000 fans in Basra. If the year ends with the national team starting out on the road to the 2026 World Cup with qualifiers on home soil, then it really will be 12 months to remember.</p><p>The last time a World Cup qualifier was hosted in Baghdad was way back in 2001. The US-led invasion two years later and the ensuing instability and insecurity (not that things were much different in the previous decades, with the Iran-Iraq war and then the first Gulf war) has meant Fifa and the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) have usually told the federation to play home games in third countries such as Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/29/bringing-football-home-to-iraq-global-stage-world-cup-qualifier">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After five months of research, I’ve learned that your hair’s natural texture is everything</p><p>Air drying – the practice of prepping hair when it’s wet, then leaving it to do its own thing without a hairdryer or heated tools – is massive right now.

It is a combination of youthful ebullience paired still with a hint of disbelief as the 17-year-old who was inspired by Lewis Hamilton looks to a future in the sport’s new all-female championship that is far from fantasy.</p><p>Having committed herself to going racing so that her final years at school became an experience she hated, then dealt with online abuse with a self-possession beyond her years, Grant is ready to embrace what she hopes will be the start of great things. The teenager from Perth in Scotland, who passed her driving test only a couple of weeks ago, wants to emulate Britain’s multiple world champion, a role model on and off track.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/apr/29/f1-academy-chloe-grant-motorsport">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Rewilding is not just about vast estates.

Inspired by a visit to the estate, or by hearing about rewilding in general, they want to know if it’s possible to apply the principles to their own garden. We think it is.</p><p>Most gardens are designed primarily for human enjoyment: for beauty, eating and relaxing, playing ballgames, and growing fruit and vegetables. But a growing concern for nature has brought about a rise in gardening to encourage wildlife. A nature-friendly approach to gardening includes not using chemicals or peat; planting nectar-rich plants and fruiting trees; using hedges rather than fences; creating a pond; turning lawns into wildflower meadows; and installing bird boxes, birdbaths and feeders, and hedgehog and bat boxes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/29/seven-steps-to-rewilding-your-garden">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This weekend marks 100 years since the opening of Wembley Stadium with the famous ‘white horse’ final of 1923 between Bolton Wanderers and West Ham United. We look back on that day a century ago with the text of the original match report from the Manchester Guardian</p><p>Wembley Stadium stands like a grey fortress at the top of a slight hill, marked from afar by its twin towers. It was approached today by a wide avenue from the main road leading through the ragged beginnings of the huge exhibition buildings. At the top of the hill the crowd had first to pass through a long line of turnstiles, and then were confronted with the enormous outer wall of the stadium, pierced at intervals by the iron gates leading to the terraces on the slope reserved for standing places. There were also flights of steps here and there giving access to the raised terrace outside, from which ticket-holders were to reach their seats on the stands.</p><p>Thousands of football fans head to the stadium in Wembley ahead of kick-off.

<p>Rangers were league champions in 1992 but the cup proved elusive – until a Chinese restauranteur and a group of ball boys spurred them on to beat Celtic on a wet night at Hampden</p><p>Although it ended in a league and cup double, Walter Smith’s first full season as Rangers manager was far from a procession. After grabbing the title in a final-day shootout with Aberdeen in May 1991 – less than four weeks after the dramatic departure of Graeme Souness to Liverpool – Smith had to rebuild quickly. With five players in and five out, it was the busiest summer of the club’s nine successive titles in that era. Because of Uefa’s imposed maximum of four foreign players, Smith had very little choice.</p><p>The most significant change was in goal, where he replaced the much-loved Chris Woods with Andy Goram. By October, it looked like a bad joke and one made on national television, no less. “Which Scottish football internationalist,” asked A Question of Sport host David Coleman, “took two wickets in the NatWest Trophy?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/29/rangers-celtic-10-men-ended-scottish-cup-curse-titles-win-hampden">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Chinese-British novelist’s highly original meditation on language, authenticity and freedom</p><p>An obsession with language, and how it simultaneously frees and limits thought, has been a consistent thread in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/xiaolu-guo" title="">Xiaolu Guo</a>’s work since her 2007 debut, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jan/27/featuresreviews.guardianreview33" title="">A Concise Chinese-English Dictionary for Lovers</a>. Like that book, her marvellous new memoir, Radical, is organised around short chapters with disparate words and phrases as titles. For each one, she gives their etymology and Chinese translation.</p><p>In Chinese writing, a “radical” is the key component of a character, and Guo’s exploration of what it means to be rooted – to a continent, a marriage, a lexicon – is exhaustive and nakedly honest. She asks “What is <em>language </em>doing in our daily life?”, referring to “language as a way to live an authentic life”. The problem of living authentically – what it might mean for a rootless woman in the 21st century – is the book’s central question.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/29/radical-by-xiaolu-guo-review-a-woman-of-character">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The actor is fantastic in the Michael Douglas role of this iconic movie, with Lizzy Caplan doing a particularly intense take on Glenn Close’s part. Here’s to remakemania!</p><p>I can’t believe I’m the first person to notice this and actually articulate it in some way, but: a lot of remakes about, aren’t there? Now I’ve said it, it seems so obvious, doesn’t it? And yet, I am the only person who has detected this trend in TV and film. What have you all been doing? Am I the only one paying attention? Buck up! Get your head out of the sand!</p><p>For what it’s worth, remake culture doesn’t bother me that much: there are only really seven stories anyway, and making up a new character is hard, and writers are very stupid. (See: when given the infinity of decision to pull a complete new person out of the ether, they end up giving their character the job of “writer”. Good one mate.) Also, most people forget 60% of everything they see anyway so you can just make it again and show it to them and they won’t even notice. But Fatal Attraction – the new Paramount+ remake of Fatal Attraction (from Monday 1 May) – is a particularly interesting example of remakemania, and, listen, while we’re both here, we might as well talk about that.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/29/paramount-fatal-attraction-erotic-thriller-joshua-jackson-lizzy-caplan-remake">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Asparagus season is so short, it’s a shame to waste even the tough end bits – use them up, along with their springtime partner, wild garlic, in this creamy, cheesy tart</p><p>On your marks, get set, go! Asparagus season has at long last begun, but there are only about six short weeks left before it comes to an end for another year. So let’s make the most of it by with a recipe that celebrates the entire asparagus all the way from its fibrous butt to the delicate tip. I like thick stems of asparagus best, but their bases can be tough. Cutting them into thin rounds should be enough to make them palatable and delicious.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/apr/29/how-to-use-entire-asparagus-butt-to-tip-wild-garlic-almond-tart-recipe">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>The Marches, Shropshire:</strong> Now they must navigate a precarious world of not just predators, but casual ecocide</p><p>All gob and <em>cheep,</em> the blackbird chicks see beyond the nest. Shadowy figures, other birds, dogs, squirrels, rain, shine, wind, voices, traffic … the next phase will be to launch themselves into all this. If they do, all hell will break loose.</p><p>It does. It feels like ages since the blackbirds began building a nest in the big Fatsia plant next to the sitting room window. What began as a discreet cup in the fork of branches became a cornet of stick and grass stem thatch, long enough to support a larger nest bowl. The evergreen hands of Fatsia leaves hid the nest but its construction and the shifts of parent birds sitting on the eggs could be seen from the window. How many eggs were laid is unknown but the parents were constantly bringing worms back, at first for each other, then for the hatchlings. Sometimes in the early morning and late evening, the male would perch on a tree top; he rarely sang and would make mostly soft, contact calls.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/29/country-diary-the-blackbird-chicks-are-out-and-up-against-it">Continue reading...</a>
