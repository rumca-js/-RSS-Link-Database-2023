It has everything: trolling, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kids-usa-mullet-championship\" target=\"_blank\">sweet-ass mullets</a>, and making vegans look stupid. The only thing missing is the vegans melting down and flailing their scrawny, soy-based arms around as the two based bros chowed down on KFC in front of them.</p><p>I still award this a 9.5 out of 10.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">Eating KFC in front of vegan protesters <a href=\"https://t.co/HJd3f1jETU\">pic.twitter.com/HJd3f1jETU</a><br />\u2014 Clown World \u2122 \ud83e\udd21 (@ClownWorld_) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ClownWorld_/status/1652021023745916928?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 28, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>This, friends, is the face of an instant legend.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"86131\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=33570594&amp;width=980\" />\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/piers-morgan-eat-steak-vegan\" target=\"_blank\">Making fun of vegans</a> is a <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/animal-rights-activists-shish-kebaab\" target=\"_blank\">time-honored classic </a>that goes back to the Great Campus Meat Tossing of 1994.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"43e2b\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33570599&amp;width=980\" />\n</p>\n<p>At Connecticut's Port Chester University (PCU), vegan terrorists staged an insurrection outside of the campus cafeteria. Even worse, it was Sloppy Joe Day. A group of students staged a mostly peaceful counterprotest by sneaking into the cafeteria and throwing meat at the protesters. Some say it was a 100 pounds, but counterprotest organizer Droz said it was much more than that.</p><p>In Droz and his fellow patriots' defense, they may have thought that if the vegans had TRIED some meat they would stop being miserable people. Sadly, not everyone felt that way.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"b73f2\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33570609&amp;width=980\" />\n</p>\n<p>Thanks to TikTok and the desire to go viral, and in the name of content, the spirit of the Great Campus Meat Tossing of 1994 lives on in today's edgelords and sh*tposters.

If you are a rational, intellectually honest individual, you SHOULD be able to agree with:</p><blockquote>One of the first things you realize when you step outside the noise for a few days is how many genuinely nice people there are in this country, kind and decent people, people who really care about what\u2019s true and a bunch of hilarious people \u2014 also, a lot of those.</blockquote><p>And also:</p><blockquote><em>This is the amazing thing, the undeniably big topics, the ones that will define our future, get virtually no discussion at all: war, civil liberties, emerging science, demographic change, corporate power, natural resources. When was the last time you heard a legitimate debate about any of those issues?</em></blockquote><p>Dwight Schrute's problem is he works in an industry when they aren't rational or intellectually honest. One where -- with a few exceptions -- <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/robert-kennedy-campagn-cheryl-hines\" target=\"_blank\">any opinion slightly right of Karl Marx gets you on the no-no list</a>.</p><p>Though Rainn has been poking his head out as of late. He made a snarky tweet about the trans-affirming abuse of the English language. Though, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/rainn-wilson-apologizes\" target=\"_blank\">one he was quick to apologize for</a>. And last month <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/rainn-wilson-anti-christian\" target=\"_blank\">the actor criticized Hollywood's anti-Christian bias</a> with NO apology after.

He shows his genitals in the locker room.\"</blockquote><p>In olden times, a guy flashing his junk to a girl was inappropriate. In 2023, if that guy identifies as a girl, it is considered equity and tolerance.</p><p>But does he identify as a girl? <a href=\"https://ktla.com/news/local-news/18-year-old-male-student-14-year-old-sister-arrested-at-school-in-riverside-county/\" target=\"_blank\">A report on KTLA</a> referred to she/her using he/him pronouns.
