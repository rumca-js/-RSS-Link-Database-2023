  <p id="Bzhlas">I’ve been watching TV on demand for over 20 years. Well before streaming, I was picking up the whole run of <em>The Sopranos </em>from the college library and making my way through the seasons. When I graduated, I kept the habit, preferring to watch things from DVD box sets rather than just zoning out in front of the television. Even when I visit family now, I’m the obnoxious one who always has a show they want to watch on Netflix or HBO Max instead of 12 episodes in a row of <em>House Hunters </em>on HGTV. But lately, I’ve been using Pluto TV, and I’ve found myself realizing just how relaxing it is to just let go.</p>
<p id="tVPwSn">Pluto TV is part of a subcategory of streaming called <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23466868">Free Ad-Supported Television, or FAST</a>. There’s some on-demand content and features, but...</p>

  <p id="ATJDfN">FAST, or free ad-supported streaming television, is the closest thing you can get to having cable without actually paying for it. As the name implies, FAST services let you watch a wide selection of content as you flip through individual “channels,” all without a subscription. While FAST services might not get the latest and greatest content, they’re still a nice option to have whenever you want to jump into some random show or movie without taking ages to decide what to watch on Netflix. Plus, you don’t even need to create an account to watch shows on most FAST services, allowing you to drop in and out as you please. All you have to do is watch some ads. </p>

Some retailers are offering free preorder incentives like a wooden plaque or an art print, which are a nice bonus that doesn’t cost anything extra.
