Also available on Xbox and PlayStation.\nThe striking color palette of Stray Blade\u2019s world and its simplified combat are admirable but flawed attempts to stand out amongst the growing din of FromSoftware-inspired action RPGs. Its large scale turns that lovely world into a labyrinth bloated with endless pickups, made maddening by a miserable map. Combat is fun when it\u2019s not bogged down by an unbearable lock-on mechanic and some repetitive and truly dumb enemies. Taken together with a forgettable story and likable but long winded characters, Stray Blade is an adventure more frustrating than fanciful.\n\n#StrayBlade #Review", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EGSe_iiBf8", "date_published": "2023-04-29 14:30:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "10 Best Star Wars Video Games of All Time", "description": "With the release of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, we look back at the best Star Wars video games of all time and rank them to see which games are the best in the galaxy.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #StarWars", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjHWBKGBAEU", "date_published": "2023-04-29 14:00:28+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 Review", "description": "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 reviewed by Joshua Yehl.

Through Rocket\u2019s tragic origin story we\u2019re given a new appreciation for this whole family of lovable malcontents.

The Star Wars Jedi: Survivor Day 1 Patch has a lot of users on Steam discussing their issues, and asking questions about why these performance issues exist in the first place. With EA releasing a public apology for the launch day woes on PC we asked developers about video game patches, why they happen, and why something like the Star Wars Jedi: Survivor patch is even a thing on launch day.  With the Star Wars Jedi: Survivor Steam issues being reported we wanted to discuss how something like that slips by during the production process. In addition we asked about why the Star Wars Jedi: Survivor PC performance issues might crop up after launch.\n\nSubscribe to IGN for more!\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/IGNentertainment?sub_confirmation=1\n\n------------------------------ ----\nWatch more on IGN here!\n------------------------------ ----\n\nDAILY FIX: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_e1aXYckPE&amp;list=PLraFbwCoisJCYFqFP7e7UQnHHZL05LooZ&amp;index=2&amp;t=0s\nGAME REVIEWS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCJmeQyJk1E&amp;list=PLraFbwCoisJBTl0oXn8UoUam5HXWUZ7ES&amp;t=0s&amp;index=2\nMOVIE REVIEWS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCJmeQyJk1E&amp;list=PLraFbwCoisJBTl0oXn8UoUam5HXWUZ7ES&amp;t=0s&amp;index=2\nTRAILERS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hr1dfwy4n90&amp;list=PLraFbwCoisJA6xInpo8WhMSrR3Y7CjatL&amp;index=2\nNEWS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ctgzg7MZiZ8&amp;list=PLyN6dWP9XPgpzD7LJttHSs_peWliw7QSW\n\n#ign", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6wrB1EXDIA", "date_published": "2023-04-29 00:58:33+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
