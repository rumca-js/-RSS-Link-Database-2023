## Stray Blade Review

Stray Blade reviewed by Jarrett Green on PC. Also available on Xbox and PlayStation.
The striking color palette of Stray Blade’s world and its simplified combat are admirable but flawed attempts to stand out amongst the growing din of FromSoftware-inspired action RPGs. Its large scale turns that lovely world into a labyrinth bloated with endless pickups, made maddening by a miserable map. Combat is fun when it’s not bogged down by an unbearable lock-on mechanic and some repetitive and truly dumb enemies. Taken together with a forgettable story and likable but long winded characters, Stray Blade is an adventure more frustrating than fanciful.

## Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 Review

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 reviewed by Joshua Yehl. Opens in theaters May 5, 2023.
The Guardians of the Galaxy deliver their swan song in Vol. 3 and it’s a rockin’ good time. Through Rocket’s tragic origin story we’re given a new appreciation for this whole family of lovable malcontents. And even though the plot has a bit too much going on, some of the humor feels stale, and Adam Warlock was woefully underused, the cast’s incredible chemistry and James Gunn’s soulful style remain unlike anything else in the MCU, and this movie sends them out on an emotional and action-packed high note.

2013 was a major year for video game news. The seventh generation of consoles were starting to show their age and it was time for Sony to reveal and launch their next home console, The PlayStation 4. This is the story of how Sony secured PlayStation 4 as a generational leader with the help of smart marketing and a gaming-first ethos from its early rumors in late 2012 to its release in the fall of 2013.

## Star Wars Jedi: Survivor Day 1 Patch and Why These Are So Common

We sat down with developers to discuss day 1 patches, and why games like Star Wars Jedi: Survivor have a tricky road to launch. The Star Wars Jedi: Survivor Day 1 Patch has a lot of users on Steam discussing their issues, and asking questions about why these performance issues exist in the first place. With EA releasing a public apology for the launch day woes on PC we asked developers about video game patches, why they happen, and why something like the Star Wars Jedi: Survivor patch is even a thing on launch day.  With the Star Wars Jedi: Survivor Steam issues being reported we wanted to discuss how something like that slips by during the production process. In addition we asked about why the Star Wars Jedi: Survivor PC performance issues might crop up after launch.
