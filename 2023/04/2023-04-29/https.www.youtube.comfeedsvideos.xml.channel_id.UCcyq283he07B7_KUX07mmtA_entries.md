Meghan Markle and Prince Harry have quit, and Prince Andrew has courted controversy – but the British royals remain one of the richest monarchies in the world.

Kampot pepper, grown in Cambodia, is so expensive because it’s considered the Champagne of pepper. In 2016, the European Union awarded pepper grown in this region a protected geographical indication. The taste of Kampot peppercorns is described as fresh, citrusy, fruity, and pungent. But these peppercorns don’t come cheap. Wholesale Kampot black pepper costs $15 per kilogram and white pepper costs $28 per kilogram. Online, it can cost over $100 per kilogram. Over 400 farmers grow this pepper, but climate change and competition from large farms could make it harder to earn a profit.
