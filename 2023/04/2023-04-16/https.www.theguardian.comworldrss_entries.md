It’s worth pointing out the unemployment rate is very low and our main objective is to keep it low, to ensure that every Australian who can work has the opportunity to work. That’s by far the better solution.</p><p><strong>It’s going to be a tight budget. It’s going to be a very tight budget. And our capacity to put in place new spending measures is going to be very constrained indeed.</strong></p><p>For all of us, there will be days when the ground is rocky and the going is tough. There will be days when it’s all we can do to put one foot in front of the other.</p><p>But when we cross the finish line, the destination will be worth it.</p><p>Australians everywhere are responding to the gracious, generous, patient invitation of the Uluru statement from the heart with their own instinctive fairness and decency.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/apr/17/australia-news-live-bruce-lehrmann-inquiry-indigenous-voice-to-parliament-anthony-albanese-penny-wong-icac-nsw">Continue reading...</a>
