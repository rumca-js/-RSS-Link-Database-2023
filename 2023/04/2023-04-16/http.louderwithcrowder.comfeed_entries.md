Or an FBI sting. Or both. Unfortunately, no one was able to warn this 21-year-old Air National <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/classified-docs-leaker-buffalo-shooting" target="_blank">Guardsman</a> before he applied online to be a hitman. </p><p>Josiah Ernesto Garcia was short on cash, so he went to "rentahitman.com" to make a quick buck. The site is a parody where people can a request murder-for-hire services as well as apply to work as a hired killer. Garcia submitted an application and offered his, erm, "services" for a mere $5000. He then repeatedly followed up on the application, even submitting more identification documents, including a resume stating his status as an expert marksman and employment in the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joy-reid-nashville" target="_blank">Tennessee</a> Air National Guard. So he was <em>very</em> serious about this. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>

<p>His resume also stated he was nicknamed "Reaper" because of his marksmanship skills. After a month of Garcia's continuous inquiries, an undercover FBI agent began communicating with him, and eventually cut a deal for Garcia to kill a man for $5000. On Wednesday, Garcia met an undercover agent at a park in Tennessee, where the agent gave him info on a fictional person and a down payment of $2500. Garcia reportedly asked if the agent needed a photograph of the dead body as proof. </p><p>According to the affidavit, the agent made sure Garcia was all in on this, asking:<em> "You are locked in? This is what you want? Because it sounds like you have a lot going on. You're in the military. You've got college. You've got a lot going on, as far as good things in your life to kinda' get in this world. It is a shady world, and I just don't want you to have regrets if you come to work for us, because it, I mean it messes with your mind, shooting people."</em></p><p>Garcia however said he had already weighed the cons of murder and had no qualms about it. After the agent told him he could make more money if he killed fifty people, Garcia said that was "rookie numbers for the Reaper." And was promptly arrested. </p><p>I feel like this should go without saying, but murder is *not* the way to make $5000. Even for the Reaper. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Watch: Country singer replaces "Bud Light" in his song lyrics and a stadium full of Americans explodes with applause

The song I Wish Grandpas Never Died is supposed to go <em>"And coolers never ran out of cold Bud Light."</em> <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-staffer-under-bus" target="_blank">But, you know.</a></p><p>Let's see what happens.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Even Riley Green is over Bud Light <a href="https://t.co/jaGcYE7Oqx">pic.twitter.com/jaGcYE7Oqx</a><br />— G.P.

Unclear is if he was intentionally making a statement on the controversy or just mixing it up. But a sell-out stadium thought he was, and they approved of him doing so. </p><p>Even if they might not realize Anheuser BUSCH produces Busch AND Bud Light. To be fair, I'm still surprised by who owns who at this point. I also do my best to drink local. Not that I don't assume 90% of local brewers don't vote for different people than I do. I support the ones who aren't dicks about it.</p><p>The reaction from the Nissan Stadium audience explains why Anheuser Busch <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/anheuser-busch-ceo-statement" target="_blank">attempted an apology at the end of the day on Friday</a> when they didn't think anyone would notice. They felt Bud Light drinkers would be impressed and people who don't drink Bud Light (but demand all companies pander to woke politics) wouldn't notice. They failed on both counts.</p><p>Green was opening up for Luke Combs. As of this writing, there is no report on what beer Combs shotgunned during his performance. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Law Enforcement Worried Movie Instructing People To Blow Up Pipelines Might Lead People To Blow Up Pipelines

For the climate, of course. Now, a movie by the same name features a group of brave environmental advocates who want to blow up a Texas oil pipeline. </p><p>You may be wondering, could this premise potentially encourage some eco-terrorists out there to, I don't know, blow up a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/axe-wielding-mob-attack-pipeline" target="_blank">pipeline</a>? And you'd be right. But don't worry, the very competent feds are already on it. So we can all rest easy. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cAuthorities are warning that the left-wing movie "How to Blow Up a Pipeline" might inspire eco-terrorists to ... well, you know. https://t.co/2n1xpZTfg7\u201d</div> — Not the Bee (@Not the Bee)

<p>The Kansas City Regional Fusion Center issued a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23772966-kcrfc-23-21-situational-awareness-bulletin-security-threats-to-pipeline-infrastructure-2-safe" target="_blank">report</a> last week that warned of a potential threat from the movie. The <a href="https://www.marc.org/safety-security/emergency-services-and-homeland-security" target="_blank">center</a> "brings local, state and federal law enforcement officials together with public and private organizations to detect, deter and respond to terrorist threats in the Greater Kansas City community."</p><p>According to the report:</p><p><em>"The movie How to Blow Up a Pipeline will be released to theaters in the United States on 7 April 2023. The KCRFC has no information on specific threats directed at the energy sector in this area. However, CIKR is consistently identified as an extremist target due to the high consequences of a successful attack."</em></p><p><em>"The movie details physical security vulnerabilities in the pipeline and stresses sabotage as legitimate and necessary."</em></p><p><em>"The movie could potentially inspire similar attacks on critical infrastructure as shown in the film and further encourage environmental activists to engage in increasingly violent action."</em></p><p>Ya don't say?</p><p>The director, however, told <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2023-04-07/how-to-blow-up-a-pipeline-neon-climate-change" target="_blank">LA Times</a>, <em>"We didn’t necessarily want the movie to be directing the audience to go out and take a particular action." </em>Which is strange, given that the title is literally an instruction manual on how to do just that.  The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9Nl1YCeD2g" target="_blank">trailer</a> features one character saying, "If the American Empire calls us terrorists, we're doing something right." The overall theme is the justification of violence because the state of the climate is so dire, and the oil industry is just that evil. </p><p>I'm not entirely sold that the movie will lead to a direct increase in the number of pipeline attacks. It's kind of like the argument against violent video games. But I also wouldn't be surprised if we soon see our beloved <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/greta-thunberg-police" target="_blank">Greta</a> leading a pipeline attack. For the climate, of course. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Haters cyberbully Motley Crue's Tommy Lee into deleting "transphobic" video, because this is who we are now in 2023

It's bad enough to see politics taking over sports and comics. Now it's coming after my heavy metal. </p><p>The drama started when Lee shared a video from Liz Wheeler on OANN that critics are calling "transphobic." As you watch the video keep in mind two things. The first is that Liz hasn't been with OANN since 2020. The second is that since 2020 people have <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/frog-pronouns-gop" target="_blank">identified as frogs</a>, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/rachel-dolezal-onlyfans" target="_blank">different races</a>, and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/period-woman-explains" target="_blank">claim they experience monthly female biologic functions without having the biological equipment to do so</a>.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"></div><p>Lee shared that video and leftists went on the attack, <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2023/04/14/tommy-lee-posts-transphobic-oan-clip-getting-dragged-online/" target="_blank">according to TMZ</a>. Keep in mind, these are the same people who are shaming YOU for choosing a different beer to crush other than Bud Light. Even Lee's fellow celebrities attacked him. Questlove, bandleader for Jimmy Fallon, told Lee he was unfollowing him over the crime of sharing a single video.</p><p>It caused the drummer to delete his post. Though I don't think because he was sorry -- he put "controversial" in finger quotes. Because he didn't feel like dealing with it anymore.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="instagram-media"><div style="padding: 16px;"> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CrC2tWDukWT/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" style="line-height: 0; padding: 0 0; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 100%;" target="_blank"> <div style="display: flex;"> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;"></div> <div style="display: flex;"> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;"></div> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 60px;"></div></div></div><div style="padding: 19% 0;"></div> <div style="display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;"></div><div style="padding-top: 8px;"> <div style="color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;">View this post on Instagram</div></div><div style="padding: 12.5% 0;"></div> <div style="display: flex; margin-bottom: 14px;"><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div style="margin-left: 8px;"> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 20px; width: 20px;"></div> <div></div></div><div style="margin-left: auto;"> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div style="display: flex; margin-bottom: 24px;"> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;"></div> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 144px;"></div></div></a><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CrC2tWDukWT/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">A post shared by Tommy Lee (@tommylee)</a><br /></div></blockquote> </div><p>I want you to make note as you read other articles about the "controversy." Most media outlets will only highlight this part of Lee's post:</p><blockquote> I am in no way transphobic or against the LGBTQIA+ community or any f*cking community…Sh*t, I’m the gayest motherf*cker around.</blockquote><p>What they'll leave out assuming you won't read his full post yourself is this:</p><blockquote><strong>I just don’t agree with how far some things have been taken.</strong> I just think it’s crazy that some people are blinding themselves because they feel they should have been born blind. I get being born female and identifying as male or being born make and identifying as female or whatever. <strong>But when PPL start identifying as babies or animals…WTF! </strong>I posted that because it got me thinking (and you should too) about where this world and our world [Earth emoji] is all going</blockquote><p>Lee's almost got it. He hasn't drawn the connection that because we accept one -- <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/z-cup-teacher-mall" target="_blank">look no further than to Kayla Lemiux in Canada</a> -- that we're expected to accept all. But he's almost there.</p><p>I just hate that even The Crue has become politically divisive. They used to be something people bonded over. To quote great Western philosopher Lou Dorchen, "We have a lot in common. We both like tits and Motley Crue."</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## "Where are your breasts?" Shop teacher with Z-cup boobs busted coming out of mall without their, um, boobs

Yes, we at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website DID report that. It turns out a guy who puts on ginormous funbags to prance around high school students might have a truth-telling problem. Rebel News got the scoop.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">
<span class="rm-shortcode" style="display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;"></span>
<small class="image-media media-caption">BUSTED! We caught Kayla Lemieux at a shopping mall. He was NOT sporting his 'real' Z-cup breasts!</small>
<small class="image-media media-photo-credit">
<a href="https://youtu.be/U37WhFe7w5s" target="_blank">youtu.be</a>
</small>
</p><p>I don't know if Canada has a Pulitzer Prize, but it needs to go to Rebel News.</p><blockquote>“Mr. Lemieux, where are your breasts? I thought your breasts were real. Where are your breasts?”</blockquote><p>The least surprising in all this is that Kayla would be the kind of -- Canadian -- to still be wearing an N95 mask in 2023.<br /></p><p>Here's where the story gets confusing because right up until now everything made total sense. Is she or isn't he?</p><p>Kayla was believed to be a beautiful and brave trans person living their authentic brave and beautiful life, even if her main feature was fake a looks like it causes back pain. Parents thought <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/shop-teacher-school-board" target="_blank">it was inappropriate for a teacher to be dressed like that</a>, but not unlike school boards in America, the Canadian school boards <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kayla-lemieux-suspension" target="_blank">said "F*ck them kids."</a></p><p>Then <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kayla-lemieux-dresses-man" target="_blank">the New York Post caught Lemieux</a> outside of school without -- I  guess at this point, "his" -- wig and strap-on titties. And I quote:</p><blockquote>“He puts the breasts on to teach, occasionally when he goes for a walk or when the cops visit.”</blockquote><p><span></span>Odd, because my understanding of trans and non-binary people is that they commit to the gimmick 24/7. They don't just put on a costume when they are around children. Kayla, it turns out, when she is away from children is a mediocre schlubby bloke.</p><p>it makes you wonder about <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/shop-teacher-rumor">the anon boards reporting</a> the teacher -- when identifying as a male -- was almost fired for "toxic masculinity" and would tell his shop class of impressional young boys how silly the idea of things like gender-neutral bathrooms is. That wasn't redpilling enough, so "Kayla" was born.</p><p>Which is it? Master troll? Sexual devient? Mental patient? We The Content demand answers once and for all!</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
