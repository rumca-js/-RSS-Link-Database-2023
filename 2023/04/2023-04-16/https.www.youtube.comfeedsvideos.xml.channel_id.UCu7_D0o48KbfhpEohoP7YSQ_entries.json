(RemoteXY)", "description": "We all love Microcontrollers and Smartphones. Unfortunately, they do not work well together because not everybody can create Smartphone apps and connect them via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi to an ESP32. Arduinos are even more complicated because they do not offer communication. This is why I like the project I will show you today: Its name is RemoteXY. Of course, it uses the Arduino IDE!\n\nMy second channel: https://www.youtube.com/HB9BLAWireless\n\nLinks:\nProject: https://remotexy.com/en/\nESP32 Dev board: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DCj2nEH or https://amzn.to/3ogYsGA\nHM-10 Bluetooth module: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DkL2ZrX or hhttps://amzn.to/3GLq6BY\nHC-06 Bluetooth Module: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DkSkYmv or https://amzn.to/3LaDTF7\nWemos D1 Mini: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DEyJqfL or https://amzn.to/43xgwfM\nWemos Relay: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DlYx6n7 or https://amzn.to/3Uzggcg\n\nExamples: https://github.com/SensorsIot/RemoteXY\n\nPatreon supporter companies:\nhttps://passiv-energie.gmbh/\nhttps://www.welectron.com/\nhttps://yosmart.com/\nYouTuber Patreon: https://www.youtube.com/@MakersMashup/\n\nThe links above usually are affiliate links that support the channel (at no additional cost to you).\nSupporting Material and Blog Page: http://www.sensorsiot.org\nGitHub: https://www.github.com/sensorsiot\nMy Patreon Page: https://www.patreon.com/AndreasSpiess\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/JfgDSa8\nIf you want to support the channel, please use the links below to start your shopping.
