We all love Microcontrollers and Smartphones. Unfortunately, they do not work well together because not everybody can create Smartphone apps and connect them via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi to an ESP32. Arduinos are even more complicated because they do not offer communication. This is why I like the project I will show you today: Its name is RemoteXY. Of course, it uses the Arduino IDE!
