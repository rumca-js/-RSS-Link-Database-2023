Content is increasingly a problem for streaming services \u2013 how on earth to hang on to hard-pressed subscribers? \u2013 with the result that more and more of them are raiding the archives. Last week, Netflix gave us <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/31/obsession-netflix-richard-armitage-charlie-murphy-interview\">Obsession</a></em>, a four-part series based on Louis Malle\u2019s 1992 film, <em>Damage</em>, in which a man becomes infatuated with his son\u2019s girlfriend (the original starred Juliette Binoche, Jeremy Irons and a wooden floor on which the pair writhed extravagantly). This week, Amazon launches <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/placeholder_title/dp/B0B8TKLW4L\">Dead Ringers</a></em>, a six-part adaptation, starring Rachel Weisz, of David Cronenberg\u2019s 1988 thriller about twin gynaecologists (Jeremy Irons was in the first version of that one, too). The hope is, I suppose, that old ideas have what new ones don\u2019t, which is bankability in the form of middle-aged nostalgia \u2013 even if sacrilege is sometimes committed in the process.</p><p>In another way, though, the decision to remake <em>Fatal Attraction</em> was unfathomable. It was a huge film in its day: a box-office hit (the second-highest grossing movie of 1987) and nominated for six Oscars, including best picture. But it was also a movie of its time: a moment, made large. The story of a New York lawyer (Dan Gallagher, played by Michael Douglas) whose life is nearly ruined by a woman, Alex Forrest (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/glenn-close\">Glenn Close</a>), with whom he has sex one weekend while his wife is away, it represents the cultural zenith of an era in which the media relentlessly characterised the single woman as, at best, lonely and unhappy, and at worst, as driven half-mad by all that she\u2019d missed out on: a man, a baby, a clapboard house in the country. The only possible way to remake <em>Fatal Attraction</em> in 2023, it seemed to me, was to give it a feminist reboot. What, though, might that involve? The prospect of Alex happily waving goodbye to Dan, having enjoyed her orgasm-filled weekend a lot but not so much that she wanted to waste any more of her time on a conventional stick like him, didn\u2019t seem to contain nearly enough jeopardy for binge TV.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/16/lock-up-your-bunnies-fatal-attraction-tv-reboot-lizzie-caplan-joshua-jackson\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/16/lock-up-your-bunnies-fatal-attraction-tv-reboot-lizzie-caplan-joshua-jackson", "date_published": "2023-04-16 13:00:11+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Protests show depth of mistrust in Israeli government, says Rothman", "description": "<p>Architect of Israel\u2019s judicial changes doubles down for next round of legislative battle when Knesset reconvenes in May</p><p>The vicious fight in Israel over the government\u2019s proposed judicial changes \u201ctranscends issues of left and right, and comes down to public distrust in government\u201d, one of the architects of the plans has said, acknowledging that there is room for compromise going forward.</p><p>Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, returned to office in December at the helm of a coalition of conservative and religious parties that make up the most rightwing government in the country\u2019s history.

Several of the bars were bathed in light reminiscent of painter Edward Hopper\u2019s lonely <em>Nighthawks</em>. In nearly all cases his camera found images whose timeframe was hard to locate: the arcade bars were rooted in 1980s gaming culture \u2013 Pac-Man, Space Invaders, Track &amp; Field were staple machines \u2013 but their regulars, as here in Barcade in the northeast suburb of Highland Park, often referenced styles from the 1950s onwards.</p><p>The project became a kind of quest: Bohbot went from borough to borough in the city and along the coast, searching out its joystick bars, acting on tipoffs and making lists of leads. It allowed him to draw an alternative map of the city, each location offering a new challenge, like levels of a video game. \u201cEvery arcade draws a slightly different crowd,\u201d he noted, \u201cfrom beachgoers and bar-hoppers to seriously committed gamers. The atmospheres vary, too \u2013 some bright, pristine, ordered; some dark, moody, covert.\u201d Several bar owners, passionate about their creations, welcomed him and his camera; other times he had to be more discreet.</p><p><em><a href=\"https://www.setantabooks.com/collections/franck-bohbot?_pos=1&amp;_psq=franck&amp;_ss=e&amp;_v=1.0\">Back to the Arcade</a></em><a href=\"https://www.setantabooks.com/collections/franck-bohbot?_pos=1&amp;_psq=franck&amp;_ss=e&amp;_v=1.0\"> by Franck Bohbot is published by Setanta Books (\u00a355)</a></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/16/the-big-picture-franck-bohbot-arcade-video-game-bar-los-angeles\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/16/the-big-picture-franck-bohbot-arcade-video-game-bar-los-angeles", "date_published": "2023-04-16 06:00:03+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "UK pensions: how to make sure you get the best income in retirement", "description": "<p>Experts offer tips on how to make the best of your contributions \u2013 and whether you could afford to retire early</p><ul><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/apr/15/uk-pensions-how-much-retire-cost-of-living-inflation-income\">How much do you need to retire as living costs soar?</a></strong></li></ul><p>The reason why one in three people won\u2019t even reach the minimum income level in retirement is that they don\u2019t have a proper national insurance (NI) record.

The Italian wine specialist Ian d\u2019Agata discusses about 500 in his marvellously detailed Native Wine Grapes of Italy \u2013 and that doesn\u2019t even cover the many non-natives, such as chardonnay, cabernet sauvignon, pinot noir and gewurztraminer, that can and do make some tremendous (and recognisably Italian) wines in various parts of the peninsula. A handful of Italian varieties have achieved international fame: pinot grigio; the sangiovese of chianti, brunello di montalcino and others in Tuscany and elsewhere in Central Italy; the nebbiolo of Piedmont\u2019s barolo and barbaresco. Others are barely known beyond their very particular local area, among them the vanishingly rare pelavegra, from the village of Verduno in barolo country, which makes delightfully delicate, strawberry-scented, finely black pepper-sprinkled reds such as Castello di Verduno\u2019s.</p><p><strong>Contesa Pecorino Colline Pescaresi, Abruzzo, Italy 2021 (\u00a39.99, or \u00a37.99 as part of a mixed case of six, <a href=\"https://www.majestic.co.uk/\">majestic.co.uk</a>) </strong>As is the case in much of France, many Italian grape varieties are hidden from view, with producers traditionally preferring to label their wines by place rather than grape, as is the modern, New World-led way. Varieties such as another from Piedmont, Gavi\u2019s cortese \u2013 which is responsible for the pristine, subtly lemon-scented raciness of the Piona Bricco delle Farfalle Gavi del Comune di Gavi 2021 (\u00a315.99, or \u00a313.99 to members, nakendwines.com) \u2013 or the garganega of soave in the Veneto \u2013 the base for the soft pear, scented white flowers and almonds of Inama Soave Classico 2021 (\u00a315.99, or \u00a312.99, as part of a mixed case of six, <a href=\"https://www.majestic.co.uk/\">majestic.co.uk</a>) \u2013 are as a consequence rather less well known than they deserve to be. Elsewhere in Italy, however, the variety\u2019s the star, not least pecorino, which makes gently incisive, citrussy whites such as the Contesa, which, I reckon pairs better with simply grilled white fish than its namesake Italian sheep\u2019s cheese.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/apr/16/italian-grape-varieties-in-all-their-diverse-glory\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/apr/16/italian-grape-varieties-in-all-their-diverse-glory", "date_published": "2023-04-16 05:00:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Quizzing celebrity castaways on their dessert island pin-ups, 1983", "description": "<p>For Clive James it was Rita Hayworth; Dame Edna chose \u2018snake-hips Strachey\u2019</p><p>Is a \u2018desert island pin-up\u2019 a thing?
