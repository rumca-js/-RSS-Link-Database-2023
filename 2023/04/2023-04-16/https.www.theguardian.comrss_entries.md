<p>This three-part drama does the only appropriate thing: tells the tale of the victims’ tragedy. It makes for relentlessly sad viewing</p><p>As much as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/raoul-moat">Raoul Moat</a> dominated the headlines back in the summer of 2010, nearly 13 years later many of our memories of the events are fuzzy. But as ITV’s miniseries remind us, even the version we were fed then was made murkier by the media and the internet. The narrative around Moat framed him as something of a dark vigilante, with a vendetta against the police and an unlikely friendship with Paul Gascoigne, who showed up at the standoff <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jul/09/paul-gascoigne-raoul-moat">offering to defuse the situation</a> with chicken, lager and a fishing rod. But in a heady mix of misogyny, media sensationalism and good old-fashioned misanthropy, even as events unfolded Moat’s victims – Chris Brown, Samantha Stobbart and David Rathband – were cast as bit players in the tale of a supposed antihero.</p><p>The show begins a year after the shooting, when people gather and lay flowers saying, “We’re here because Raoul Moat is a hero to us”, before flashing back to the previous summer. Samantha is lying in the sunshine in Birtley, Gateshead, flirting with charming karate instructor Chris. The two tentatively form a bond, with Chris having the sort of openness and kindness that Samantha can scarcely believe exists in the world. But Samantha is getting increasingly nervous as her ex-boyfriend, who is in prison serving a four-month sentence for assaulting a nine-year-old, is due to be released in a matter of days.</p><p>The Hunt for Raoul Moat aired on ITV1 and is available on ITVX.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/16/the-hunt-for-raoul-moat-review-the-heartfelt-performances-leave-you-bereft">Continue reading...</a>

<p>France’s constitutional court has approved the president’s plans to raise the retirement age. That will not stop the protests</p><p>As France’s constitutional council debated the legality of Emmanuel Macron’s unpopular pension reform last week, massed ranks of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/14/riot-police-deployed-to-french-court-as-it-prepares-to-rule-on-macron-pension-changes" title="">riot police</a> stood by in central Paris. It was an unsettling sign of the times. Mr Macron’s reckless decision to use executive powers to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 – avoiding a parliamentary vote he thought he might lose – has turned a highly charged national debate into a wider crisis of democratic legitimacy. On Friday, the nine members of the great and the good who make up the council found themselves at the eye of the storm.</p><p>Following the court’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/14/french-court-approves-macrons-unpopular-plan-to-raise-pension-age" title="">verdict</a> that the reform is constitutionally sound, Mr Macron will hope to draw a line and move on.

<ul><li>Leicester 62-19 Exeter</li><li>Ashton scores hat-trick for 101st Premiership try</li></ul><p>Try-scoring 101 for Chris Ashton. English rugby’s most prolific finisher cemented his status as the Premiership’s greatest ever try-scorer by becoming the first player in the history of the competition to reach 100 tries, running in a hat-trick in Leicester’s dominant win over Exeter. Ashton, who last week announced he is retiring at the end of the season, began the match on 98 but the 36-year-old wasted little time in racing to three figures before adding his third on the day and his 101st in total.</p><p>His cause was helped by three yellow cards to Exeter – two for Olly Woodburn which meant a red for the Chiefs wing – but here was a reminder of just how deadly Ashton remains. His were three of nine tries for Leicester, who have now all but confirmed their place in the playoffs. They were caused problems by Exeter in the first half but the champions are timing their end-of-season run formidably. Ashton deserves the limelight but his fellow wing Anthony Watson was lively throughout, Dan Kelly consistently excellent at centre and George Martin a colossal force at lock.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/apr/16/leicester-exeter-premiership-rugby-union-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

## Golden Age by Wang Xiaobo review – revolution in the bed

<p>The cult writer’s amusing 1992 novel, now published in English, lampoons China’s communist regime via the sex diary of a frustrated biology teacher</p><p><em>Golden Age</em> is a Chinese bestseller by cult writer Wang Xiaobo that now appears in a new translation and charts the story of Wang’s work and sex life, beginning with the Cultural Revolution. The novel opens with a 21-year-old Wang working in a remote commune and starting an affair with the 26-year-old “old shoe” Chen Qingyang. What follows is some of the funniest writing on sex I have encountered, written in the form of “confessions” to the Communist party. Wang’s tone is that of an “intellectual youth” turned peasant diligently explaining his sexuality to party officials.</p><p>Ten years later, Wang becomes a biology lecturer and a fully functioning cog in the well-oiled machine that is Chinese communism. We learn of the grime, the discipline, and the beatings. “Life is but a slow, drawn-out process of getting your balls crushed.” Public humiliation is “criticism sessions”. Harsh punishment is “struggle sessions”. Sex and women are his only relief, and it is under this haze of relief, I think, that Wang commits to sentences such as: “Her two itty-bitty breasts were like flower buds that only appeared seasonally” and “She wore a blissful, Socratic innocence”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/16/golden-age-by-wang-xiaobo-review-revolution-in-the-bed">Continue reading...</a>

Behind the traditional Georgian facade of a house on the south coast is a home dedicated to postmodern design<p>If there is one theme that will come to define early 21st-century interiors it’s nostalgia. Modernism, minimalism, maximalism – all these 20th-century “isms” have shaped the way we do up our homes in recent decades. Now, says Vicky Wetherill, a vintage dealer who likes to anticipate trends, it is time to embrace postmodernism: the experimental, exuberant design movement which had its heyday in the 1980s.</p><p>Wetherill’s own home in Hastings, East Sussex, where she lives with her husband and business partner, Jason Skriniar, pays homage to that era. Oversized furniture and objects, and woodwork picked out in a confection of ice-cream pastels and lacquered surfaces invoke the spirit of the age, without feeling retro. “It was a period of optimistic hedonism that produced some fantastic, playful pieces,” says Wetherill, whose clients include Chanel and Paloma Faith. “Postmodernism changed the boundaries of what was acceptable – but not in a vulgar way.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/16/memphis-by-the-sea-reinventing-a-hastings-home">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Known for We Are Lady Parts, her controversial sitcom about a Muslim punk band, the writer-director has made a feature film, Polite Society, that celebrates young female defiance with martial arts-fuelled energy</p><p>The muse can be a fickle thing to find, but Nida Manzoor’s inspiration has always been close to home. “My sister, Sanya, is only a year older than me and she is such a big influence on my work,” says the screenwriter and director. “She’s always been a rebel and I hated to see her being told what to do. She’s become my muse.”</p><p>Manzoor’s free-spirited sister has long been a theme in her work. Manzoor, 33, rose to prominence in 2021 with her debut Channel 4 series, <em>We Are Lady Parts,</em> which told the story of an all-female Muslim punk band balancing cultural pressures with trying to write thumping tracks lambasting their daily lives. The Manzoor sisters, who were brought up by Pakistani Muslim parents in Singapore and then London, wrote the music for the series together, along with their brother, Shez . The frontwoman of the fictional band is a tattooed, straight-talking singer called Saira, a commanding presence that Manzoor created to mirror Sanya’s energy. “Sanya is now a musician and spiritual life coach who lives in Berlin, plus she is covered in tattoos,” she says admiringly.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/16/nida-manzoor-polite-society-we-are-lady-parts-series-two-interview">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Rachel Cooke was looking forward to a TV reboot of the controversial 1987 thriller – only to find that, despite being made by a team of women, its attitudes have barely changed</p><p>When I first heard that Paramount had made an eight-part TV series based on Adrian Lyne’s 1987 movie, <em>Fatal Attraction</em><em>, </em>I was less surprised than I might have been. Content is increasingly a problem for streaming services – how on earth to hang on to hard-pressed subscribers? – with the result that more and more of them are raiding the archives. Last week, Netflix gave us <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/31/obsession-netflix-richard-armitage-charlie-murphy-interview">Obsession</a></em>, a four-part series based on Louis Malle’s 1992 film, <em>Damage</em>, in which a man becomes infatuated with his son’s girlfriend (the original starred Juliette Binoche, Jeremy Irons and a wooden floor on which the pair writhed extravagantly). This week, Amazon launches <em><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/placeholder_title/dp/B0B8TKLW4L">Dead Ringers</a></em>, a six-part adaptation, starring Rachel Weisz, of David Cronenberg’s 1988 thriller about twin gynaecologists (Jeremy Irons was in the first version of that one, too). The hope is, I suppose, that old ideas have what new ones don’t, which is bankability in the form of middle-aged nostalgia – even if sacrilege is sometimes committed in the process.</p><p>In another way, though, the decision to remake <em>Fatal Attraction</em> was unfathomable. It was a huge film in its day: a box-office hit (the second-highest grossing movie of 1987) and nominated for six Oscars, including best picture. But it was also a movie of its time: a moment, made large. The story of a New York lawyer (Dan Gallagher, played by Michael Douglas) whose life is nearly ruined by a woman, Alex Forrest (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/glenn-close">Glenn Close</a>), with whom he has sex one weekend while his wife is away, it represents the cultural zenith of an era in which the media relentlessly characterised the single woman as, at best, lonely and unhappy, and at worst, as driven half-mad by all that she’d missed out on: a man, a baby, a clapboard house in the country. The only possible way to remake <em>Fatal Attraction</em> in 2023, it seemed to me, was to give it a feminist reboot. What, though, might that involve? The prospect of Alex happily waving goodbye to Dan, having enjoyed her orgasm-filled weekend a lot but not so much that she wanted to waste any more of her time on a conventional stick like him, didn’t seem to contain nearly enough jeopardy for binge TV.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/16/lock-up-your-bunnies-fatal-attraction-tv-reboot-lizzie-caplan-joshua-jackson">Continue reading...</a>

She has gone on to create other such potently enclosed worlds in books including <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/30/bitter-orange-claire-fuller-review">Bitter Orange</a></em> and the Costa novel prize-winning <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/apr/24/unsettled-ground-by-claire-fuller-fierce-angry-energy">Unsettled Ground</a></em>, often using that same rural remoteness to enhance the feeling of isolation and its accompanying sense of slow-burn jeopardy.</p><p>Her latest, <em>The Memory of Animals</em>, is set largely in London and yet takes her preoccupation with characters cut off from the rest of society to another level. Within a few short chapters, the apocalypse that turned out not to have happened in Fuller’s first novel really has taken place, although its trigger is not bombs but a deadly pandemic.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/16/the-memory-of-animals-by-claire-fuller-review-apocalypse-again">Continue reading...</a>

<p>He was one of Wales’s greatest rugby stars – and the game’s first professional player to come out as gay. But it’s the truth about HIV that Gareth Thomas is set on tackling now</p><p>Gareth Thomas isn’t sure where to start. Or, rather, if he should even try to. Mum, Yvonne, warned against it before he left Bridgend yesterday. The publicist now hovering in earshot seems unconvinced. Yet here the two of us are on a wintery March morning: sitting in a west London hotel lobby, to discuss a relationship he was in 10 years ago. His sex life, specifically. In how much detail remains uncertain.</p><p>Thomas retired from rugby in 2011, but through punditry, activism and reality TV, the former Wales international – recently made a CBE – has maintained a major public presence. As an LGBTQ+ pioneer, sporting giant and HIV advocate extraordinaire, he’s a national hero in Wales and beyond. In secret, however, Thomas has been facing years of complex legal wrangling, including a criminal investigation. In a recently settled civil case, an ex-partner – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/30/gareth-thomas-settles-case-with-ex-over-hiv-transmission-accusation" title="">Ian Baum</a> – alleged that Thomas “deceptively” transmitted HIV to him a decade ago. Only in August 2022 did some of the details become public. That wasn’t Thomas’s call – he was given six hours’ notice.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/16/gareth-thomas-interview-i-will-be-that-voice-for-people-with-hiv-i-will-not-be-derailed">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Human beings can be well served by waiting around for pleasures. The truth is, healthy anticipation makes our lives more enjoyable</p><p><br />My grandmother lived to the ripe old age of 84. Her memorable life advice was: “Always have something to look forward to.” She was a great believer in not getting what you want: “As long as you want something, you have something to live for.” This is kind of depressing and counterintuitive “wisdom”, as it suggests that you will be best served by living in abject misery and in a state of constant yearning. And yet, she was right.</p><p>In my view, when we can have everything we want exactly when we want it, it doesn’t bring us joy. Human beings are best served by hope, anticipation and a bit of healthy waiting around. This relates to the vastly underrated ability to “save up”. It’s hard to save up money. It is maybe even harder to save up your attention or your excitement. Everything from Just Eat (literally impatience in brand nominative shape) to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/oct/03/klarna-debt-buy-now-pay-later-fees-interest">Klarna</a> (the “payment plan” that promises the ability to “shop now, pay later”) suggests that the cult of “gimme now” has taken over.

<p>A Labour win still seems likely, but where’s the narrative? As the Tories shift further right, the stakes couldn’t be higher</p><p>Only six weeks ago, Keir Starmer’s Labour party seemed locked into the mood of optimism and quiet delight that had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_next_United_Kingdom_general_election">started to cohere</a> over the previous autumn. Polls continued to show leads over the Tories of about 25 percentage points. Starmer was guardedly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/feb/23/keir-starmer-labour-already-planning-second-term-in-government">looking ahead</a> to two terms in office and “a decade of national renewal”. Rishi Sunak and his allies, by contrast, were synonymous with disruption, impossible living costs and the state of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/25/rishi-sunak-boris-johnson-prime-minister">constant internal chaos</a> labelled “long Johnson”. We were still heading, it seemed, for one of those moments when a tired and divided ruling party simply collapses, and change becomes inevitable.</p><p>Maybe we still are. Whenever the next election arrives, Conservative defeat is still the most likely outcome. But as MPs prepare to return after the Easter recess, the battle between the two big Westminster parties has subtly shifted. Labour’s average poll lead is now in the teens rather than 20s, Starmer and Sunak’s <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-uk/rishi-sunaks-personal-poll-ratings-improve-labour-retain-strong-lead-voting-intention">personal ratings</a> are almost even, and gurus of political gambling have been heard <a href="https://www2.politicalbetting.com/index.php/archives/2023/04/08/the-polls-are-definitely-tightening/">advising against</a> any bets on an outright Labour win. The key reasons why are not hard to work out: notwithstanding such grinding problems as the ongoing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/apr/16/nhs-strikes-when-are-they-and-what-will-happen">strikes in the NHS</a>, Sunak is just about managing to look like an efficient, stable, confident kind of leader, while Starmer seems stuck – ahead, but coasting.</p><p>John Harris is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/16/keir-starmer-polls-tightening-labour-tories">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The video-sharing app has become the best place to see the unfolding effect of the cost of living crisis, with weekly shops and ‘receipt reveals’ watched by millions</p><p>Before Rachel Nixon goes to the supermarket, she sketches a quick shopping list in her head. In the garage she usually has a sack of potatoes, and meat, green veg and bread in the freezer. For the bits in between, she will head either to her local, membership-only brand discounter, the Company Shop in Barnsley, or to a mainstream supermarket such as Aldi. “Today I’m going with a £50 budget to feed five of us – £10 a day, £2 per person per meal. I’ll go home and look at what I’ve got in the freezer, check the rice, pasta. It’s make do and mend.”</p><p>Unlike other shoppers, Nixon has a press pass, because when she’s filling her basket, she will also be filming a TikTok on her phone, and the Company Shop management requires permission. Her content, which “began as a joke”, follows her around the aisles, scrutinising produce and bargains against the biggest question at any supermarket in 2023: how can this cost this much? At many mainstream shops, Nixon says: “A £50 shop is now an £80 shop. People in the middle are floundering around.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/apr/16/supermarket-sweep-tiktok-save-money-food-shopping">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘It’s my calling’: Mikaela Loach, rising star of the climate crisis campaign

Young activist Mikaela Loach is bringing a steely determination to the fight for climate justice. Just don’t call her ‘the new Greta’<p>There were a few tears on Mother’s Day last month when Mikaela Loach’s mum came to visit her at her flat on the south coast. Loach handed her a hot-off-the press copy of her new book, <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/its-not-that-radical-9780241597538" title="">It’s Not That Radical: Climate Action to Transform Our World</a></em>. Its cover dazzles in pink – as does Loach today, a rapidly rising star in the fight for climate justice, who pitches up for our interview in a pink puffer, rose-pink boilersuit and pale-pink glasses. After her mother read Loach’s acknowledgments thanking her for passing on her “huge heart”, she “had a good cry. And then she called my grandmother in Jamaica who was, like, ‘Why you bawling out like?’”</p><p>Loach promptly rumbles her grandmother for having cried herself when she’d read her the accounts of their conversations early in the pandemic. Her grandmother had described how Hellshire Beach, near Kingston, where Mikaela played as a tiny child, had almost disappeared due to climate change. The helplessness Mikaela heard in her grandmother’s voice spurred her on to write the book.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/16/its-my-calling-mikaela-loach-climate-campaigner-its-not-that-radical">Continue reading...</a>

## Architect Terry Farrell: ‘Conservation is a mind thing’

<p>The man behind MI6 headquarters in London and TV-am’s egg cups has long sought to repurpose buildings and connect with the public – goals now embodied in a new centre in his home town of Newcastle</p><p>There have always been two sides to Terry Farrell. On the one hand he likes to stand up for the ordinary citizen, to back community groups and conservationists against arrogant planners and architects, to protect old buildings from demolition, to take it to the man. On the other, he himself designed big, imposing buildings for powerful institutions: the flesh-coloured ziggurat of the MI6 headquarters in Vauxhall in London, for example, which was memorably detonated in the Bond movie <em>Skyfall</em>, and Alban Gate, a shoulder-padded office block in the City of London that embodies the brash gigantism of the big bang era. His 442 metre (1,450ft) <a href="https://farrells.com/project/kk100">KK100</a> tower in Shenzhen, China, completed in 2011, is the world’s tallest building by a British architect.</p><p>“I have vacillated in my career between new build and adaptation,” Farrell says. Now, at the age of 84, he has come down in favour of the gentler, preservationist side of his architectural persona. This week, the <a href="https://www.farrellcentre.org.uk/">Farrell Centre</a>, which puts into practice his belief that the general public should be involved in the design of their cities, will open in Newcastle. He has donated £1m (“It would have been more but the pandemic wiped everything out”) towards the £4.6m capital cost, as well as his practice archive. The centre, which is part of Newcastle University, includes a gallery and an “urban room” – a place where “local people can go to learn about the past, present and future of where they live”, which is something that Farrell thinks every city should have.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/16/farrell-centre-newcastle-terry-farrell-urban-room-mi6-tv-am">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The snowpack contains enough water to fill downstream reservoirs ‘multiple times over’, which could mean a rapid runoff</p><p>Spring has offered California a welcome reprieve from the record rains and historic snowfall that hammered the state in recent weeks, but a new danger wrought by the warming weather looms large. The state’s enormous snowpack will soon begin to melt – and communities are bracing for waters to rise yet again. Trillions of gallons of water packed within the record level of snow blanketing the Sierra Nevada range are expected to rush into rivers and reservoirs as the weather heats up<strong>,</strong> heightening flood risks in areas already saturated by the state’s extremely wet winter.</p><p>The snowpack, which stands at 233% of the 1 April average, contains enough water to fill downstream reservoirs “multiple times over”, said climate scientist Daniel Swain in an online briefing this week. “That’s a big deal,” he added.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/16/california-snowpack-big-melt-flooding-weather">Continue reading...</a>

I was 39 and had published four novels and received several award. To what extent I was chosen or was a “ready-made” for the judges, I don’t know.

Living in North Carolina, agentless and clueless about the industry or submission process, I doubt I was under consideration.</p><p>In compiling these once-in-a-decade lists, <em>Granta</em>’s judges and influencers claim to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/apr/06/then-now-granta-best-novelists" title="">foresee “big names”</a> in the future British literary scene. A writer must be under 40, resident or citizen and have published a literary novel or be about to. I wasn’t registering the 2013 list. Some writers live in a dim cave, some anticipate calendars, some network. When the news came, I was pleased. It’s nice to be spotlit, validating to have work endorsed by critical experts, especially other novelists.

<p>Spring meals that balance hearty fare with new season joy</p><p>The froth of cherry blossom, fat bunches of asparagus and spring sunshine are here to lift our spirits, but these first spring days often end with a certain chill and the need for what I call “a proper dinner”. A glowing pot of lamb perhaps, left to putter away in the oven, the meat slowly nudged towards tenderness by a couple of hours in a mildly spiced tomato sauce. I did just that this week, stirring in a deep, fragrant warmth with a spoonful of rose harissa. I introduced tart little dried apricots and the fizz of lemon, partly to put a spring in its step and partly because I like the marriage of lamb and apricots. Everyone wiped their plates clean with leaves of pink-tipped chicory – perky, like rabbits’ ears – and slices of what is probably the last of the year’s blood oranges.</p><p>The week had already had something of a celebratory ring to it. I had found a couple of bunches of early asparagus and brought them home, cradled at the top of the shopping bag to protect the fragile tips. The occasion felt special enough to make a bowl of hollandaise sauce made all the more seasonal with a handful of wild garlic leaves. We piled the asparagus and sauce on to thick slices of toasted focaccia to make the somewhat spendy spears go further.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/apr/16/nigel-slater-recipes-for-asparagus-hollandaise-and-lamb-with-apricots">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Swan theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon; Orange Tree; Finborough, London</strong><br />Shakespeare’s wife moves centre stage in Lolita Chakrabarti’s pivotal adaptation of Maggie O’Farrell’s Hamnet, while urgent productions from two small London theatres tackle recent history head on</p><p><em><a href="https://www.rsc.org.uk/hamnet/">Hamnet</a></em>, a play with a plague-driven plot, is the first opening at the Swan since the pandemic closure. Not since <em>Matilda</em> has there been such a female-centred production at the RSC. Rarely has there been a drama that looked so firmly into the 21st century without losing the S in RSC. Or one that, using – hurrah – locally inflected accents, drew directly on Shakespeare’s home town.</p><p>This is not the best play ever seen at Stratford – that might after all be <em>Hamlet</em>. Yet though not always fully charged with power, Lolita Chakrabarti’s adaptation of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/22/maggie-ofarrell-novel-hamnet-interview-the-agony-of-burying-your-child">Maggie O’Farrell’s 2020 novel</a> is pivotal. O’Farrell’s absorbing book shows Shakespeare’s imagination infiltrated by family and female life. The most striking literary conclusion is that the playwright was driven to write <em>Hamlet</em> by the death from plague of his 11-year-old son, Hamnet. As important is the notion that the intelligence of his wife, Agnes (not Ann) Hathaway, has been underestimated because not literary, and that her influence was pervasive – not least in the language of flowers and herbs used by the bereft Ophelia.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/apr/16/hamnet-rsc-stratford-lolita-chakrabarti-maggie-ofarrell-review-you-bury-me-orange-tree-theatre-pussycat-in-memory-of-darkness-finborough">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Tories’ scorched earth policy has wrecked our rivers, our NHS, our freedom of movement. Now even 6 Music is at risk</p><p>The Conservatives are a defeated army in vindictive retreat, robbing the museums and cathedrals as they head for the hills; setting fire to, and laying waste to, every institution in their wake; poisoning the rivers and destroying the food supplies; leaving only a barren mess for the incoming Labour government to shoulder the blame for. Jonathan Gullis has found a lacy French bra in the rubble of a fine mansion and is wearing it as a hat, laughing and touching his genitals; in an abandoned dentist’s waiting room, Bill Cash has eaten an entire tank of tropical fish; Suella Braverman has made oven gloves out of the corpse of a dead cat; and, having ruined a hospital, Mark Francois is now asleep, naked, in an incubator.</p><p>At least the scorched earth policy of the second world war armies only scorched the earth. The Conservatives, and their divisive Brexit, burned the soul out of Britain. We recognise the nation we used to know, but only as Charlton Heston, in <em>Planet </em><em>of </em><em>the Apes</em>, recognises the stuffed corpse of his former crewmate Dodge, eviscerated and mounted by apes in a museum, a glass-eyed taxidermy cadaver of its old self.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/16/britain-is-a-dying-nation-in-need-of-new-curators">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Her latest TV series calls for her to play both twins in a reworking of Cronenberg’s dark and bloody classic, Dead Ringers. But Rachel Weisz, the famously private Oscar-winner, is used to stepping in and out of roles</p><p>There’s quite a lot of blood. There’s really quite a lot of blood in <em>Dead Ringers</em>, but it’s not the blood of bullet holes or stab wounds, or any of the other violences one might expect in a dark psychological thriller like this. It’s blood on knickers and operating tables, and smeared on silk shirts, and the blood as a baby’s head crowns – the bloods of birth and loss, guttural screams, and in the middle of it all, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/rachel-weisz" title="">Rachel Weisz</a>, twice.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/davidcronenberg" title="">David Cronenberg</a>’s original 1988 film, a grisly examination of the relationship between the physical and mental self, Jeremy Irons played twin gynaecologists whose dubious ethics led to all manner of horrors. In this gender-swapped adaptation, in which Weisz stars and exec-produced, she plays those twins identical in every way but character. Dr Beverly Mantle is the shy moral introvert, whose love affair with a patient triggers a psychic unravelling between the sisters, while Elliot is a modern mad scientist, hungry for meat, drugs, conflict, godliness, sex. What could come off as a soapy trick, in Weisz’s Oscar-winning hands becomes camply surreal, uncanny, seductive, a little perverse – joy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/16/life-can-be-complicated-rachel-weisz-on-balancing-privacy-with-stardom-and-dead-ringers">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The diagnostic terms for autism were overhauled 10 years ago. Experts, campaigners and autistic people reflect on these changes</p><p>Chris Bonnello, 37, was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome in 2011. But these days he just says he’s autistic. “A lot of us did not want to let go originally, it was something that fitted us very nicely,” recalls the teacher turned autism advocate who runs a website called <a href="https://autisticnotweird.com/">Autistic Not Weird</a> from his home in Nottingham. “But it is better for autistic people if we are all recognised, acknowledged and appreciated together.”</p><p>Sarah Weston, 47, received a diagnosis of autism spectrum condition in 2019. Yet in daily life she describes herself as an “Aspie” – an informal, affectionate term for a person with Asperger syndrome. She doesn’t have the complex learning disabilities some autistic people do and which non-autistic people can think of when they hear autism. She says using Aspie or Asperger’s just helps outsiders understand what she’s like and clears up confusion. And she is certain, based on her cognitive and language abilities, that she would have received the Asperger’s label had she been diagnosed earlier.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/apr/16/they-tried-to-wipe-it-out-the-problem-with-talking-about-aspergers">Continue reading...</a>

The picture that Matthew Goodwin paints of modern Britain’s ‘ruling class’ shows a weak understanding of how and where influence works<p>In 1956, the radical American sociologist C Wright Mills wrote about what he called, in the title of a book, <a href="https://archive.org/details/c_wright_mills_the_power_elite/mode/2up" title=""><em>The Power Elite</em></a>. America’s elite, he observed, forms a “compact social and psychological entity” that “towers over the underlying population of clerks and wage earners” and whose “values” are “differentiated” from those of the “lower classes”. “All their sons and daughters,” he added, “go to college, often after private schools; then they marry one another… After they are well married, they come to possess, to occupy, to decide.”</p><p>Seven decades later, the British political scientist Matthew Goodwin similarly paints, in his new book <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/1428/9780141999098" title=""><em>Values, Voice and Virtue</em></a>, a picture of “the new elite” in Britain. The brushstrokes are familiar, drawing on the work of communitarian and “post-liberal” thinkers of recent years. Britain has “a new dominant class” that has captured its institutions and imposes its “radically progressive cultural values” on the rest of the nation, adrift as it is from the conservative instincts of the majority.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/16/this-obsession-with-new-elite-hides-real-roots-of-power">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The French director on making the closest thing to an autobiography, stripping Léa Seydoux of her glamour and dating fellow film-makers</p><p>French screenwriter and director Mia Hansen-Løve, 42, was born in Paris to parents who were both philosophy professors. She studied German at university, then had stints as an actor and film critic before making her directorial debut in 2007 with <em>All Is Forgiven</em>. Her subsequent films include <em>Father of My Children</em>, <em>Goodbye First Love</em>, <em>Eden</em> and <em>Bergman Island</em>. Her new film, <em>One Fine Morning</em>, is about a single mother caring for her ailing father while embarking upon a new romance. She lives near Paris with her partner, film-maker Laurent Perreau, and their children.</p><p><strong>How closely was your new film, </strong><em><strong>One Fine Morning</strong></em><strong>, inspired by your own late father’s illness?<br /></strong>All my films, in one way or another, use autobiographical elements. Or I should say biographical, because the majority are not inspired by my own story but those of people dear to me. But this one is probably the closest to a self-portrait. The character of Georg has the same disease my father had – a rare degenerative condition called <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/types-dementia/Posterior-cortical-atrophy#:~:text=Posterior%20cortical%20atrophy%20(PCA)%2C,of%20PCA%20is%20Alzheimer's%20disease.">Benson’s syndrome</a>. When I was writing the screenplay, he was still alive and I was visiting him, like Georg’s daughter Sandra in the film. So those scenes were inspired by very fresh memories. I had the intuition that if I didn’t write about it right now, I never would. If I’d waited, I wouldn’t find the courage to turn back and look at these painful moments. But that’s only half the inspiration. The other half is a new love, the rediscovery of happiness, and how to balance those simultaneous feelings of grief and joy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/16/mia-hansen-love-one-fine-morning-the-most-cathartic-thing-was-turning-a-difficult-dark-reality-into-something-fun">Continue reading...</a>

<p>She has spent the day smiling at everyone and everything – because she loves people, presents and coloured paper</p><p>It is possible she had never seen cake before today, but she has now, and something deep and beastly stirs within her tiny chest. Quite absurdly, given that she was surely only born a few days ago, my tiny, irascible daughter has just turned one, so we have gathered the exact number of persons we can reasonably fit in our kitchen to celebrate. Every single plate and bowl we have is doing double duty for the guests assembled. A life spent entirely in small flats has meant that, though we are now theoretically capable of hosting more than three surplus people, we have not updated our stocks of crockery to reflect this. Nor have we enough chairs, so the older children in attendance are being fed outside on patio furniture, on the first afternoon this year for which alfresco dining might be judged remotely possible, albeit not necessarily desirable.</p><p>My daughter has spent the day smiling, because she loves people, presents, and coloured paper, and the occasion has produced all three in larger than usual quantities. A few of our guests have not seen her since this smile developed the four chompers which now beam back as she smashes gifts and people with abandon, her teeth a symmetrical 2 up, 2 down arrangement that’s never looked more winningly charming. She only started sleeping through the night a few weeks ago, which has improved her mood greatly in all other areas, and perhaps added to the exaggerated, mystifying sense that she is clearly little more than a newborn, and could not possibly be one-year-old at all.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/16/seamas-oreilly-my-daughter-has-celebrated-her-very-first-birthday">Continue reading...</a>

After that, political oblivion beckons – and Macron will still be under 50 in April 2027. Maybe this ticking clock helps explain why he courts danger like a bare-chested surfer riding the waves on the beach at Biarritz.</p><p>At home, Macron has caused uproar in recent months by pushing through controversial pension reforms opposed by two-thirds of the population. The row has contributed to a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/france/" title="">plunging personal approval rating</a>, down to 30% this month. Facing a confidence vote in March, his government survived by bypassing parliament.

Going so negative betrays a lack of confidence about how to convey Sir Keir Starmer’s positive messages<p>Go hard or go home. Such is the defiantly unrepentant response of those Labour people willing to defend the party’s digital attack ad on Rishi Sunak, which smeared the Tory leader with the accusation that he doesn’t believe that adults convicted of sexually abusing children should <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/apr/07/labour-defends-ad-claiming-sunak-doesnt-think-child-sex-abusers-should-be-jailed" title="">go to prison</a>. All is fair in love, war and politics and there’s no shame in winning ugly if that’s what it takes to get to power. So say those who think they can justify the ad. Against them are ranged critics from across the spectrum, including many people normally sympathetic to Labour, who shudder that caricaturing the Tory leader as soft on paedophiles is a descent into a vile style of politics that Sir Keir Starmer’s party will come to regret.</p><p>This unedifying episode has been revealing about the state of Labour.

The conflict in Ukraine has jolted people out of their affluent ease and forced them to take sides<p>Just what is Germany’s <em>Zeitenwende</em>, the latest coinage in a language famous for its compound nouns? The “change in times” announced by the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year rolled like a thunderclap across a country that, since unification in 1990, had flourished on the benefits of the post-cold-war peace dividend, its status as Europe’s powerhouse economy and being de facto regulator of the single currency, calling the shots in eurozone squeezes.</p><p>For obvious reasons of 20th-century experience, today’s federal republic is an entity more comfortable with its role as a proponent of restraint and cautious multilateralism than decisive action. The Ukraine crisis blew up that placidity, leaving it internally fraught on how to respond and at what cost. Last week, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-nato-leaked-memo-defense-budget-boris-pistorius/" title="">a newspaper leak</a> revealed that a pledge by Scholz to supply a fully equipped army division to Nato in response to Russia’s war on Ukraine by 2025 is coming unstuck. A memo from the head of the army cast doubt on whether his forces could “hold its own in high-intensity combat”, saying it will only be able to “fulfil its obligations to Nato to a limited extent” (a masterful understatement in the context).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/16/in-germany-times-changing-but-many-would-rather-turn-back-clock">Continue reading...</a>

There’s not much culinary paraphernalia on display in her kitchen but her house is full of people, and <em>The Real Housewives of Potomac</em> is paused on the telly. “There is something beautiful about a pot that you spent that much time on,” she says, wistfully: salt beef, pigs’ tails, ham hock and stout, smoked in cinnamon and allspice, and thrown into a cauldron for hours on end.</p><p>“First, never shop on the same day as a big cook. This is very important. If you come back and unpack and start cooking at 3pm, of course you’ll be pissed off, of course you’ll hate cooking. If you’re doing the cook on Saturday, do the shopping on Thursday.

<p>The art was, of course, sublime. Unlike the boat trip to Holland, the relentless rain, clogged motorways and packed gallery rooms</p><p>Did I feel smug when I got tickets to the blockbuster Vermeer exhibition in Amsterdam? Sure, a bit. Less when I booked in January than after reviews started appearing, competing with superlatives: “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/feb/12/vermeer-rijksmuseum-amsterdam-review-one-of-the-most-thrilling-exhibitions-ever-conceived" title="">One of the most thrilling exhibitions ever conceived</a>” and “<a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/vermeer-at-the-rijksmuseum-review-a-once-in-a-lifetime-experience-v3wkkz7f3" title="">A once-in-a-lifetime experience</a>.” I got smugger when I started reading it was impossible to book, even for bankers’ wives and gallery benefactors. “It’s become a kind of social failure not to have some hat to pull tickets from,” one writer <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/i-have-a-ticket-to-vermeer-in-amsterdam-money-cant-get-you-one-5wtwjml5j" title="">explained</a>, making me, theoretically, a social success for the first time ever.</p><p>But my scramble for tickets came from a place of existential panic. “Once in a lifetime” is a compelling – or terrifying – concept when you reach the middle of your own, and “never” becomes a realistic alternative. It’s hard not to get a touch of vertigo thinking about finite time and infinite possibility. I feel it especially with art, weirdly, since it’s hardly ephemeral. But there’s so much I want to see and so much I’ve missed. I discover incredible exhibitions, start plotting a visit, blink and they’re gone. It happened recently with one about <a href="https://www.carnavalet.paris.fr/expositions/parisiennes-citoyennes" title="">Parisian women</a>. I booked a Eurostar in a fit of sweaty Yolo, then life got in the way. Now I move my train booking regularly, admitting to myself that no, I won’t be going to Paris this month (the exhibition ended ages ago). But Vermeer got under my skin – it felt urgent, something I’d bitterly regret missing. I booked a ferry and planned a mad one-day dash, making my husband come even though he had no idea what we were visiting (he only asked about 15 minutes into the journey – there’s a man who will never be haunted by Fomo).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/16/how-vermeer-made-me-a-social-success-for-the-first-time-ever">Continue reading...</a>

Her philosophy professor father Georg (Pascal Greggory) is suffering from Benson’s syndrome, a neurodegenerative condition that is causing his mind, vision and memory to fail. “His entire life was dedicated to thinking,” says the clearly distraught Sandra, a professional translator whose ability to intermediate is crucially failing her, and who increasingly feels “closer to my father with his books than with him”. Only his companion, Leïla (Fejria Deliba), seems truly able to reach Georg, who has even closed his mind to the beauty of a once-loved Schubert sonata – a heartbreaking moment.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/16/one-fine-morning-review-mia-hansen-love-lea-seydoux-moving-tale-of-love-and-loss">Continue reading...</a>

The Church of England is doing its best to turn the new king and queen into latter-day deities<p>‘God of love, we raise to you our Queen Consort”: for anyone who has longed to mention Camilla Parker Bowles to the most high but struggled to find the words, the Church of England is here, with a set of new prayers, to help. Will they work? Given the impressive pace of her ascent from dedicated fox-chaser to – after years of regular Anglican invocations – near deity, it seems almost blasphemous to ask.</p><p>In 1996 more than half of England’s bishops thought Camilla and Charles should never marry. When, in 2005, they did, in a register office, 73% of those polled were <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-342725/Charles-Camilla-wedding-backlash.html" title="">opposed to her becoming queen</a>. Although the late queen then denied Camilla the bespoke name checks in Anglican worship enjoyed (until their withdrawal in 1996) by Charles’s first wife, she did enjoy inclusion in regular state prayers for “all the royal family”, followed by her 2022 orison upgrade, one that can still shock unwary congregants out of a spiritual reverie: “Almighty God, the fountain of all goodness, we humbly beseech thee to bless Camilla the Queen Consort.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/16/as-charles-is-bestowed-with-mystical-powers-so-much-for-a-secular-coronation">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Politicians, media moguls, doctors, teachers and even Harry and Meghan have all thrown in their hats. So is grit and perseverance over? Gaby Hinsliff charts the rise of the quitters</p><p>When Julia Keller dropped out of graduate school at the tender age of 19, she was fully expecting a parental lecture on why she should tough it out. Instead, to her relief, her father offered to come and fetch her. What had felt like a terrible failure at the time actually turned out to be a blessing in disguise as she found her niche in journalism instead, working her way up over the next couple of decades into a senior position as book critic and feature writer at the <em><a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/chinews-julia-keller-20130507-staff.html" title="">Chicago Tribune</a></em> newspaper. But when Keller decided just over a decade ago to quit journalism, too, in order to write fiction, this time her mother was horrified.</p><p>“Her generation, even more than mine, was very much, ‘You do not quit a good job that is paying you a fair salary! Your working conditions are not terrible, you’re not in a Dickensian workhouse, how dare you quit?’” she explains over Zoom from Ohio. “She just could not fathom why anyone would do that.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/apr/16/want-to-quit-your-job-or-your-relationship-maybe-you-should">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The latest celebration of emerging literary talent brings thrills, charm and emotional punch to the page. But this new generation have taken an inward turn compared with the more worldly themes of bygone years</p><p>Every decade since 1983, an editor of the literary quarterly <em>Granta</em> has tasked a panel of writers and critics with naming the 20 best British novelists aged under 40. The first list, which included Martin Amis, Julian Barnes, Kazuo Ishiguro, Ian McEwan, Salman Rushdie, Pat Barker, William Boyd and Graham Swift, defined the nation’s literary fiction not just for a generation but a lifetime, at least for anyone young enough to be eligible for this year’s selection. Subsequent lists had star quality, too. In 1993, Hanif Kureishi and Alan Hollinghurst. In 2003 came Zadie Smith and Monica Ali, listed when <em>Brick Lane</em> was still a manuscript. The 2013 list spotlit Ross Raisin, Evie Wyld and David Szalay, who each went on to publish exceptional novels, while Naomi Alderman won the Women’s prize for <em>The Power</em>, now a hit TV series. If nobody talks them up as a golden generation, it probably says less about their calibre as writers and more about the diminishing clout of a marketing wheeze dreamed up when four-channel TV was still a novelty.</p><p>The class of 2023 are a rangy bunch with some fantastic writing already under their belts. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jul/14/the-liars-dictionary-by-eley-williams-review-a-glorious-way-with-words">Eley Williams</a> brings emotional punch to tickled wordplay. The slow-burn thrill of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/26/birnam-wood-by-eleanor-catton-review-the-root-of-all-evil-luminaries-booker-prize">Eleanor Catton</a>’s many-tentacled plotting. The tragicomic charm of Welsh short story writer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/14/we-dont-know-what-were-doing-thomas-morris-review">Thomas Morris</a>. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/06/losing-the-plot-by-derek-owusu-review-category-confounding-tale-of-life-in-a-foreign-culture">Derek Owusu</a>’s wrenching excavations of filial strife, close-to-the-bone disclosures in multilingual shards. Yet for some reason <em>Granta</em>’s heart doesn’t seem entirely in it. “I never have much faith in lists in any case,” warns the magazine’s owner and current editor, Sigrid Rausing, explaining that another set of judges might have chosen another 20 writers. Well, sure! All the more reason to put a bit of welly behind the ones you did pick. (Ian Jack, doing this job in 2003, was also ambivalent, true, with good cause: when three of the authors chosen under his watch turned out at the last moment to be ineligible, three others sidelined as “quite good” became “best” – a demonstration, he wrote, of the “arbitrariness of literary lists”, given as “comfort to those who fail to get on them, and a caution to those who do”.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/16/granta-163-best-of-young-british-novelists-5-review-more-solipsism-than-state-of-the-nation">Continue reading...</a>

## The big picture: the neon allure of Los Angeles’s video game bars

<p>Franck Bohbot’s photographs of the city’s gaming spots depict a world of escapism familiar from American movies and art</p><p>Franck Bohbot grew up in France, and when he arrived in Los Angeles in 2018 he found the sprawl hard to navigate. One reference point for him was <a href="https://franckbohbot.com/copy-of-back-to-the-arcade">the city’s video game bars</a>, whose atmosphere he recognised from favourite adolescent films, including <em>Terminator 2</em> and <em>Ferris Bueller’s Day Off</em>. Having wandered into his first one, Blipsy’s in Koreatown, he started chasing their escapist gloom. Several of the bars were bathed in light reminiscent of painter Edward Hopper’s lonely <em>Nighthawks</em>. In nearly all cases his camera found images whose timeframe was hard to locate: the arcade bars were rooted in 1980s gaming culture – Pac-Man, Space Invaders, Track &amp; Field were staple machines – but their regulars, as here in Barcade in the northeast suburb of Highland Park, often referenced styles from the 1950s onwards.</p><p>The project became a kind of quest: Bohbot went from borough to borough in the city and along the coast, searching out its joystick bars, acting on tipoffs and making lists of leads. It allowed him to draw an alternative map of the city, each location offering a new challenge, like levels of a video game. “Every arcade draws a slightly different crowd,” he noted, “from beachgoers and bar-hoppers to seriously committed gamers. The atmospheres vary, too – some bright, pristine, ordered; some dark, moody, covert.” Several bar owners, passionate about their creations, welcomed him and his camera; other times he had to be more discreet.</p><p><em><a href="https://www.setantabooks.com/collections/franck-bohbot?_pos=1&amp;_psq=franck&amp;_ss=e&amp;_v=1.0">Back to the Arcade</a></em><a href="https://www.setantabooks.com/collections/franck-bohbot?_pos=1&amp;_psq=franck&amp;_ss=e&amp;_v=1.0"> by Franck Bohbot is published by Setanta Books (£55)</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/16/the-big-picture-franck-bohbot-arcade-video-game-bar-los-angeles">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Attacks on Rishi Sunak are pointless if Labour is going to let the crowning disaster of Tory government pass without comment</p><p>First we hear from the International Monetary Fund that the UK economy is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/apr/11/uk-economy-shrink-imf-euro-area-energy-costs-inflation" title="">bottom of the G7 class</a>. Then come the absolutely disastrous export figures for October-December from the Office for National Statistics: the volume of exports was more than 9% below the pre-pandemic average. This compares with a double-digit increase in Italy’s exports – er, yes, a country which is still a member of the European single market.</p><p>There was a time when devaluation of the pound revived exports. No longer. Brexit and the damage wreaked by a succession of Conservative governments have seen to that. The pound has been spectacularly devalued against the dollar and the euro since the Brexit referendum. This has done precious little to boost exports but has had an all too obvious effect on import prices. Hence inflation in the UK is worse than in other industrial countries – thanks to, guess what, Brexit.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/apr/16/brexit-caps-40-years-of-conservative-failure-that-starmer-fears-to-oppose">Continue reading...</a>

For sheer range, few countries offer a greater choice than Italy when it comes to different types of grape<p><strong>Castello di Verduno Verduno Doc Basadone, Piedmont, Italy 2020 (£18.67, <a href="https://www.justerinis.com/">justerinis.com</a>) </strong>Of all the many reasons to love Italian wine, one of the most compelling is the sheer, dazzling array of grape varieties the country’s winemakers have at their disposal. The Italian wine specialist Ian d’Agata discusses about 500 in his marvellously detailed Native Wine Grapes of Italy – and that doesn’t even cover the many non-natives, such as chardonnay, cabernet sauvignon, pinot noir and gewurztraminer, that can and do make some tremendous (and recognisably Italian) wines in various parts of the peninsula. A handful of Italian varieties have achieved international fame: pinot grigio; the sangiovese of chianti, brunello di montalcino and others in Tuscany and elsewhere in Central Italy; the nebbiolo of Piedmont’s barolo and barbaresco. Others are barely known beyond their very particular local area, among them the vanishingly rare pelavegra, from the village of Verduno in barolo country, which makes delightfully delicate, strawberry-scented, finely black pepper-sprinkled reds such as Castello di Verduno’s.</p><p><strong>Contesa Pecorino Colline Pescaresi, Abruzzo, Italy 2021 (£9.99, or £7.99 as part of a mixed case of six, <a href="https://www.majestic.co.uk/">majestic.co.uk</a>) </strong>As is the case in much of France, many Italian grape varieties are hidden from view, with producers traditionally preferring to label their wines by place rather than grape, as is the modern, New World-led way. Varieties such as another from Piedmont, Gavi’s cortese – which is responsible for the pristine, subtly lemon-scented raciness of the Piona Bricco delle Farfalle Gavi del Comune di Gavi 2021 (£15.99, or £13.99 to members, nakendwines.com) – or the garganega of soave in the Veneto – the base for the soft pear, scented white flowers and almonds of Inama Soave Classico 2021 (£15.99, or £12.99, as part of a mixed case of six, <a href="https://www.majestic.co.uk/">majestic.co.uk</a>) – are as a consequence rather less well known than they deserve to be. Elsewhere in Italy, however, the variety’s the star, not least pecorino, which makes gently incisive, citrussy whites such as the Contesa, which, I reckon pairs better with simply grilled white fish than its namesake Italian sheep’s cheese.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/apr/16/italian-grape-varieties-in-all-their-diverse-glory">Continue reading...</a>

A block of flats was badly damaged and rescue crews were continuing on Saturday to try to rescue people trapped underneath rubble.</p><p><strong>Russian shelling in Kherson killed two women</strong> on Saturday, the Ukrainian president’s office said.</p><p><strong>The Wagner mercenary group has captured two more areas of Bakhmut</strong>, Russia’s defence ministry said. Ukraine’s military said pro-Kyiv forces were still holding on amid “bloody and fierce battles”. The claims have not been independently verified.</p><p><strong>A Russian official has claimed four people were killed and 10 injured in Ukrainian shelling of a town in Russian-controlled Donetsk</strong>. Denis Pushilin said a seven-year-old girl was among those wounded in Yasynuvata.</p><p><strong>Russia has been using drones to attack Ukrainian police in Kherson</strong>, according to the region’s police force. It said a police car was attacked in the Korabel area, injuring two officers and damaging the car, while in Beryslav one officer was injured and cars damaged.</p><p><strong>A new international economic support package of $115bn is giving Ukraine more confidence it can prevail</strong> against Russian forces amid growing recognition the war could continue for longer than expected, the Ukrainian finance minister said on Saturday.

Ukraine’s grain exports have been transiting through the European Union to other countries since Ukraine’s Black Sea routes were blocked by Russia’s invasion, leading to prices being driven down.</p><p><strong>A new Russian law has removed an obstacle that has allowed some men to dodge the draft </strong>and suggests Moscow anticipates a lengthy conflict in Ukraine, the UK Ministry of Defence says. Vladimir Putin was reported to have signed a bill on Friday to create a digital draft system, making it easier to mobilise Russians into the army and stirring fresh fears in the country.</p><p><strong>The Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has said the US should stop “encouraging war” in Ukraine “and start talking about peace”</strong>. In that way, the international community would be able to “convince” the Russian and Ukrainian presidents that “peace is in the interest of the whole world”, Lula told reporters in Beijing at the end of a visit where he met president Xi Jinping.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/16/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-417-of-the-invasion">Continue reading...</a>
