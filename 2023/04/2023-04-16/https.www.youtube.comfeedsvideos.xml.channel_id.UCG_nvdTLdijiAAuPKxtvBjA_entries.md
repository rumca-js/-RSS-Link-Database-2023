Shazam: Fury of the Gods is a movie. That's the best way to describe it. It was born when The Rock aka Black Adam wanted to have nothing to do with Shazam and to instead fight Superman. And the result is one of the most generic and non-memorable superhero movies you'll see. It became a box office flop and probably lost money and now that's it for Shazam. Shazam himself was convinced that this movie is a good alternative to seeing John Wick 4, but I doubt it because there isn't anything standing out here. So in today's Anatomy of a Failure, let's look for a couple key reasons Fury of the Gods is such a generic movie that doesn't feel much like anything other than "a movie."
