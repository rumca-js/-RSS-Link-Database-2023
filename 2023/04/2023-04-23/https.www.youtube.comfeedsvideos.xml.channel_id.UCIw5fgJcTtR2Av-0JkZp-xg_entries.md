00:00 Making-of
03:16 Jamming out
03:51 Full Song

I didn't know which toys to use, so I just grabbed whatever I could into the studio - toy piano book, very noisy vehicles book, and a bunch of other stuff. Found out I didn't need many - these books are noisy! This was a fun little experiment. I had no idea if it would even work, or what would come out of it. Hope you enjoyed the video as much as I did making the song!

Created on the Teenage Engineering OP-1 sampler and completed in Logic Pro X using stock plugins and instruments.
