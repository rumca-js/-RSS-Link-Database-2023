<p>Boatloads of relatives carrying biodegradable urns are saying their farewells over water instead of trying to buy expensive and scarce funeral plots</p><p>Xiao Hu never expected to make a living from the dead. For years she worked in her family business offering boat tours to tourists visiting Zhoushan, an archipelago off the east coast of China’s mainland. But in recent years her proximity to the sea, and to the temple-dotted hills of Mount Putou – one of Chinese Buddhism’s four sacred mountains – started to attract a different type of clientele.</p><p>The first time that a customer asked to use one of the boats to scatter their loved one’s remains into the East China Sea, Xiao Hu refused. She felt it was “not very pleasant” to work with the dead. But one elderly man, a Zen Buddhist, “kept asking if we could do a sea burial for him”. So after some consideration, she decided to “make his wish come true”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/24/ashes-to-ocean-sea-burials-become-chinas-solution-to-crowded-cemeteries">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Italy’s prime minister has navigated her first six months with disturbing success. But her government remains a threat to core European values</p><p>At last November’s Cop27 summit in Egypt, Rishi Sunak made a point of carving out <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/06/cop27-flying-visit-rishi-sunak-real-stance-climate" title="">time for a chat</a> with Europe’s other newly appointed prime minister, Giorgia Meloni. For both leaders there was something to gain from this impromptu bilateral. As the small-boats controversy continued to grab headlines, Mr Sunak hoped to emulate Ms Meloni’s success in turning irregular migration into a profitable dividing line with the left. For her part, Ms Meloni needed her radical-right party, which has neo-fascist roots, to be seen as part of the conservative mainstream.</p><p>This week there will be another chance to exchange notes, as Ms Meloni comes to London on a two-day visit. Six months on, the Italian leader’s normalisation project has been disturbingly successful. Abroad, the hostile headlines have largely disappeared, including in the liberal media. Domestically, her poll ratings, and those of her party, are <a href="https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/italy/" title="">higher than at the autumn election</a>. In some rightwing circles, Ms Meloni has begun to be seen as <a href="https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/giorgia-meloni-the-leader-of-the-european-right/" title="">a potential leader</a> of a post-Merkel conservative axis in European politics.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/23/the-guardian-view-on-giorgia-meloni-normalising-the-radical-right">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With austerity eviscerating their budgets, councils are renting out public land to generate income</p><p>When the mill owner Joseph Strutt cut the ribbon on the <a href="https://www.inderby.org.uk/parks/derbys-parks-and-open-spaces/derby-arboretum/" title="">Derby Arboretum</a> in 1840, entry came with a caveat. This landscaped sweep, one of the first public parks in England, was only <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/wellbeing/outdoors/11908169/Britains-public-parks-175-years-old-but-will-they-survive.html" title="">open to the public</a> on Sundays and Wednesdays. For the rest of the week, its fountains and pathways were reserved for paying customers, whose entry fees effectively subsidised the park.</p><p>The system was scrapped in 1882, as the growing concern for public health among Victorian reformers accelerated the creation of open public parks in towns and cities across England. Anyone can now stroll through Derby’s arboretum. But another form of gatekeeping is taking place in parks today. Councils that have seen their budgets eviscerated by austerity are finding ways to turn parks into cash-generating assets, often by renting stretches of the land to fenced-off commercial events.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/23/the-guardian-view-on-parks-an-asset-that-should-be-for-everyone">Continue reading...</a>

<ul><li>Saracens 45-21 London Irish</li><li>Leaders all but confirmed to host Northampton in semi-final</li></ul><p>London Irish’s hopes of reaching the Premiership playoffs were extinguished in brutal fashion by Saracens who ensured they will finish top of the pile with a home semi-final against Northampton in three weeks’ time all-but confirmed. Sarries were not at their best but in many ways it was a vintage performance, the kind they have served up so often in these parts, grinding Irish down before squeezing the life out of them with Owen Farrell to the fore.</p><p>For Irish, a promising season – on the field at least – will end short of the playoffs. They had some impressive performers, none more so than the No 8 So’otala Fa’aso’o, and they have a raft of young English talent to build around. More importantly, they need to secure significant investment to safeguard their future which, in the current climate, is easier said than done but in playing terms there is grounds for optimism next season.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/apr/23/saracens-london-irish-premiership-rugby-union-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

Writer, teacher and historian whose book Journey to an Illusion provided an insight into the lives of postwar Black immigrants<p>When the writer and educator Donald Hinds, newly arrived in London from Jamaica, with boyish good looks and impeccable manners, attended his appointment at the Brixton labour exchange in the mid-1950s, he did so with a certain spring in his step. After all, he had his national exam certificates and the classroom experience that he was certain would land him a good teaching job in the “mother country”, as he called it.</p><p>The clerks there had other ideas, and signposted him to try out for the role of “transport executive bus conductor” with London Transport. Donald, who has died aged 89, recalled that “it sounded very grand”. He passed the test and was posted to Brixton bus garage in Streatham Hill, where he became the fifth Black conductor in the company. It was handy for him that one of the drivers who had been asked about the potential pairing told the bosses that he did not mind “working with a coloured”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/23/donald-hinds-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Pink, blue, yellow… Coloured bathroom suites are pushing the all-white sets out of fashion</p><p>To walk into the <a href="https://brokenbog.com/" title="">Brokenbog</a> warehouse is to walk into a flushable rainbow. Grand porcelain towers of 50,000 toilets, basins and bathtubs are stacked in a Pantone-esque pattern of pinks, greens and blues. To be specific: Flamingo, Melba, Romany, Heather, Pampas, Silver Fox, Sorrento Blue and more, a hundred more, each shade insistently nostalgic in its own specific way.</p><p>“When my parents bought a former Corporation house in Stevenage New Town in the 1970s,” says <a href="https://www.port.ac.uk/about-us/structure-and-governance/our-people/our-staff/deborah-sugg-ryan" title="">Deborah Sugg Ryan</a>, professor of design history at the University of Portsmouth, “the first thing they did was to rip out the white bathroom and replace it with an aspirational avocado green suite with matching rippled tiles.” A decade later, across Britain the opposite was happening. Ccolour was bleached from bathrooms again, avocado suites making way for minimal white sanctuaries. The popularity ofminimalism in of the 1990s led to spa-like bathrooms, their function as much a place of “wellness” as cleanliness. White metro tiles suggested an industrial space, hygienic and pure, and pleasingly modern. Sugg Ryan charts the rise and fall of the coloured bathroom from 1932, when “speculatively built houses became more affordable and the coloured bathroom suite was a mark of individuality and modernity”. Art Deco geometric styles with black borders led to pastels, “like mint and pink, which were popular into the 1950s when vanity basins became fashionable. Pastels gave way to more muted tones, like beige and the notorious avocado green in the 1970s. The coloured bathroom suite fell out of favour in the 1980s when there was a fad for Victoriana and the return of the freestanding roll-top bath. Until recently, white reigned supreme, combined with built-in storage and beige or grey tiles.” Recently, Sugg Ryan bought a pink sink on impulse, and is very pleased with it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/23/retro-loos-flushed-with-success-eva-wiseman">Continue reading...</a>

## Should I worry about how much sugar I consume?

<p>Sugary foods are easier to access than ever and designed to keep us coming back for more. Are they actually addictive – and should we quit them?</p><p>Everyone loves sugar. And for good reason! Back in the paleolithic days, when food was scarce, you’d have had to gnaw through nearly a metre of chunky, fibrous sugar cane to get the same amount of energy you can now glug down via a single can of Coke. But apart from the fact that most of us aren’t chasing enough mammoths to need that kind of calorie hit any more, is there anything really that bad about our fondness for the sweet stuff? Or is it actually addictive and should we be quitting it entirely? Toothbrush at the ready: the truth might leave a sour taste.</p><p>First of all, it’s important to understand the distinction between “free” sugars – added to foods like sweets, cakes, biscuits, and fizzy drinks – and the sugar found naturally in milk, fruit and vegetables. “The intrinsic sugars naturally incorporated within the cellular structure of food, like the sugar found in whole fruit and vegetables, are released more slowly into the bloodstream,” says the nutritionist <a href="https://lilysoutternutrition.com/">Lily Soutter</a>. “This is also the case with milk sugars that come alongside a helping of protein and fat, which can keep you feeling fuller for longer. The recommendation for adults is that we cut back on ‘free’ sugars to just 5% of total energy intake, which equates to about 30g a day for adults.” That’s roughly seven teaspoons.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/23/should-i-worry-about-how-much-sugar-i-consume">Continue reading...</a>

## Metallica: 72 Seasons review – solid rather than spectacular

<p>(Blackened)<br />James Hetfield’s adventurous lyrics aren’t matched by the tempo on a 77-minute album set to chug mode</p><p>Having spent two decades making progressively worse albums, <a href="https://www.metallica.com/">Metallica</a> finally came good again with 2008’s <em>Death Magnetic</em> and 2016’s <em>Hardwired... to Self-Destruct</em>, both of which harked back to the inventiveness and sheer energy of their 1980s material. In their wake, <em>72 Seasons</em>, the Californians’ 11th album, feels like a step backwards. While the 12 songs here are indisputably as heavy as anything they’ve ever recorded, across 77 long minutes the tempo is far too often set to “chugging”, except on a couple of bracingly thrashier numbers and the more nuanced closer, Inamorata. Imagine 1991’s <em>Black Album</em> – the record that catapulted them into the big league – with barely any of the hooks or melodies and you wouldn’t be too wide of the mark.</p><p>At least there is greater adventurousness lyrically. James Hetfield delves back into his troubled childhood (as he first did on 1988’s Dyers Eve) for some of his most personal lyrics to date, most notably on the bleak Chasing Light: “Lost his way through wicked streets, but he is someone’s little boy”. (Not every song is this revealing <em>– </em>the furious <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX34gq-ZaWw">Lux Æterna</a>‘s lyrics instead nod to early inspirations <a href="https://www.diamondheadofficial.com/">Diamond Head</a> as well as their own Motorbreath.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/23/metallica-72-seasons-review-solid-rather-than-spectacular">Continue reading...</a>

But some visits are welcome – we hardly ever see my in-laws, since they’re fairly elderly and live in France, but I like them! It’s a miracle. I hardly like anyone.</p><p>But it’s shaming to suddenly see your home through other eyes. Before they arrived, we surveyed the squalor we’d got used to, each secretly blaming the other. The shoe and pizza box mountain in the hall, an insanitary trip hazard. A pair of socks left on the radiator since last summer. A mummified – what? Apple? Lemon? Mouse? – in the fruit bowl, an unconscionable amount of hair everywhere, the sofa smelling of old dog and surrounded by crisp packets and coconut water cartons.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/23/saw-the-uk-through-the-eyes-of-my-french-in-laws-and-it-was-deeply-embarrassing">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Tate Modern, London<br /></strong>Though they shared a fascination with spiritualism and with abstract form, clear contrasts emerge in this controversial pairing of painters</p><p>They never met. They never saw nor even knew of each other’s work. One was a Swedish visionary, taking directions (she claimed) from angels, the other an ascetically high-minded Dutch modernist. Yet they are paired together in <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/hilma-af-klint-piet-mondrian">Tate Modern’s immense and enthralling show</a> with the startlingly counterintuitive aim of discovering their commonality.</p><p><a href="https://hilmaafklint.se/">Hilma af Klint (1862-1944)</a> was a new age artist born before her time. That she seemed to know it herself is at least part of the legend. At her death, in some obscurity, Af Klint left instructions that her prodigious output not be shown in public for another 20 years. Audiences of the future, she believed, might be more receptive to her highly esoteric paintings, with their vocabulary of petals and sepals, suns, seeds and planets, radiant triangles, tendrils and discs. She was proved right, more than seven decades later, when the Guggenheim’s 2018 retrospective became the biggest hit in the museum’s history.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/23/hilma-af-klint-piet-mondrian-forms-of-life-review-a-thrillingly-odd-couple">Continue reading...</a>

In many ways, my attempts at happiness in adulthood have been attempts to get back to that uncomplicated feeling of relaxation and pleasure.</p><p>I think I’ve managed to get closer to it now than I’ve ever been before in adult life, in part by rediscovering past pleasures.</p><p>Joseph Coelho is a British poet and children’s author who was elected children’s laureate in 2022</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/commentisfree/2023/apr/23/happiness-child-music-photography-lego">Continue reading...</a>

Under the watchful and resourceful eye of award-winning conservationist Gladys Kalema-Zikusoka, Uganda’s threatened mountain gorilla population has made an impressive recovery – as has the local community<p>The <a href="https://www.bwindiforestnationalpark.com/" title="">Bwindi Impenetrable Forest</a> is tucked away in a remote corner of southwest Uganda. Meaning “place of darkness” in the Runyakitara language, this dense, mist-swathed rainforest makes for a good hiding place for half of the world’s remaining mountain gorillas. The other half, which the American primatologist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jan/16/dian-fossey-google-doodle-gorillas" title="">Dian Fossey</a> so famously befriended, live in Rwanda’s <a href="https://virunga.org/" title="">Virunga national park</a>.</p><p>These majestic but shy creatures – whose existence now generates about 60% of Uganda’s tourism revenue – like to hide, especially when they know veterinary intervention is afoot. The gorillas are always outsmarting the humans – if they see someone carrying a dart gun (for sedation, vaccinations, medicine, etc), they’ll walk backwards so as not to expose their backs, where the dart needs to land. They also like to mock-charge at humans, stopping suddenly to indicate they mean no harm, yet leaving no doubt as to who holds the power. And if they’re really not feeling the presence of humans, they’ll outright charge at you.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/23/champion-of-the-gorillas-the-vet-fighting-to-save-ugandas-great-apes">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The first in a two-part Dumas ​reworking is opulent and exciting, with a glorious​, vampy​ performance from Green</p><p>The first instalment of a two-film French-language adaptation of Alexandre Dumas’s swashbuckling classic, this lavish period drama taps enthusiastically into the spirit of the source material. This is flamboyant, ostentatious, grandstanding film-making, unashamedly old-fashioned and incorrigibly entertaining. Everything, from the opulent court costumes to the showy single-shot fight sequence that cements the grudging respect between D’Artagnan (François Civil) and his new comrades (Vincent Cassel, Romain Duris, Pio Marmaï), is delivered with a flourish and a wink. All the muck and sweat in the world fails to disguise the fact that Civil makes for an impossibly pretty D’Artagnan, but the picture’s seductive power lies elsewhere, with a glorious, typically extravagant performance from Eva Green as the treacherous Milady. She’s great fun in a role that might have been tailor-made for her skill set: Milady is vampy, venomous and dripping with goth jewellery.</p><p>In cinemas now</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/23/the-three-musketeers-dartagnan-eva-green-shines-as-milady-in-flamboyant-french-adaptation">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The writer’s impressionistic second novel follows a pupil and teacher as they navigate the social codes of rural Ireland</p><p>Jamie O’Neill stands apart from other kids his age in Emory, a fictional town in the west of Ireland. A lifelong reader of Edgar Allan Poe, he nevertheless favours the symmetries of mathematics over fiction, revering the work of the late Iranian Fields medallist Maryam Mirzakhani. On his first day at Christ’s College, the local all-boys secondary school, he knows exactly how many steps it will take him to walk there from home (2,816). And he wants to build a perpetual motion machine so that, by some complex logic that only he understands, he can reconnect with his mother who died giving birth to him.</p><p>Jamie is the singular centre of Elaine Feeney’s second novel – after <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/18/as-you-were-by-elaine-feeney-review-darkly-comic-fiction-debut">As You Were</a></em>, winner of the Kate O’Brien award in 2021 – though he shares the narrative with Tess Mahon, an additional needs teacher whose life is in the grip of the kind of chaos that Jamie abhors. Trying for a child on IVF, she finds herself increasingly estranged from her self-satisfied banker husband, Paul. She feels out of place, too, at Christ’s College, whose headmaster Father Faulks is fostering a culture of intolerance against anyone different. When she connects with Jamie, bullied on his first morning, it’s uncertain whether she is throwing him a lifeline or vice versa.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/23/how-to-build-a-boat-by-elaine-feeney-review-secret-shame-and-practical-woodwork">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘Clock time’, all about productivity, money and economic growth, threatens to destroy us, says artist Jenny Odell. But there are other kinds of time, and we need to learn to embrace them</p><p>Jenny Odell, the artist and writer, appears on my screen. She’s 35 years old, with long dark hair, a fringe, and big glasses with dark frames. She’s in her kitchen in Oakland, California. She loves nature and for a while she taught art and design at Stanford. In her art she finds objects and images, often on the internet, and arranges them into beautiful shapes. She likes looking at random things and thinking deeply about them. Four years ago she published a book called <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/apr/02/jenny-odell-how-to-do-nothing-attention" title="">How To Do Nothing</a></em>, where she explains that the internet, by being such a useful servant to us, has managed to turn itself into our master; the result is that we no longer pay attention to what’s really important.</p><p>Get off all those apps, she says, and start looking at the real world, which actually does need our attention. Barack Obama said <em>How To Do Nothing </em>was one of his books of the year.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/23/clock-watching-meet-the-artist-who-thinks-time-is-ruining-our-lives">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Learning to feel OK with unpredictability can bring great rewards. Just ask the world’s scientists and artists who embrace  doubts and the unknown </p><p>We are experiencing now the greatest uncertainty humanity has ever known.” Nine years ago, this statement by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/yuval-noah-harari" title="">Yuval Harari </a>provoked explosive laughter from my teenage daughter. She whispered to me, “what about the blitz? The Black Death? Come on …” I was torn between embarrassment, as heads scowled at a young woman who clearly didn’t know her place, and pride in her critical thinking. That instinctive rejection of Harari’s generational narcissism was valid then and more than justified today: 2014 was a cakewalk compared to 2022.</p><p>Uncertainty is a mental state brought on when we know we don’t know something about the future. So it’s different from ignorance because, when we feel uncertain, we have enough information to glean how much more we are missing. We know <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-crisis" title="">climate change is real</a> but not in enough detail to decide whether to buy sandbags or move house. <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/research-and-innovation/en/horizon-magazine/qa-future-pandemics-are-inevitable-we-can-reduce-risk" title="">Epidemiologists are fully confident there will be future epidemics</a> but not when or what the pathogen will be. There is no shortage of data, there’s too much! And it’s ambiguous, susceptible to a wide range of interpretations. The defining characteristic of uncertainty is that, unlike risk, it is unquantifiable. Probability can’t capture its ambiguity or complexity. What we do know, for certain, is that this <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0887618516300251?via%3Dihub" title="">leaves us deeply uncomfortable</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/23/embrace-the-unknown-the-benefits-of-learning-to-live-with-uncertainty">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The PM banging on – again – about numeracy doesn’t look likely to provoke the conflict he’s hoping for</p><p>The prime minister has fallen off the not-talking-about-maths wagon. Until last week, he hadn’t done a speech about maths since 3 January. I <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/08/more-maths-rishi-sunaks-calculation-doesnt-add-up">wrote at the time</a> that I thought he was seeking solace in the familiarity of a favourite school subject. It’s a difficult time of year for most of us, all resolutions and pine needles, anyone might need comforting. Now it’s the spring with its scent of optimism and blossom. But not for Rishi: last Monday, he did a big speech about maths again.</p><p>To be clear, he wasn’t updating us on the maths policy he announced in January. Back then, he pointed out that in Britain, unlike most other major economies, children don’t have to learn any maths after the age of 16. Last week, he said it again. In January, he was saying how our children’s futures, and the UK’s economy, are held back by numeracy problems.

<p>It’s also true that some of them can’t actually write yet</p><p>My son is writing his first book. He’s not the first of our family’s second generation to follow me in this path. Since outing myself as an author, more than a few of my nephews and nieces have sought to outdo my efforts, often with nerve-jangling success. On a trip to Worthing last month, my nephew Daniel sneered quite derisively when I told him it had taken me three years to write my book, since he’d written two that weekend alone. My niece Anna wrote a novel – with the enviable title of <em>Two Children, Millions of Doors and Good and Evil </em>– that was jarringly readable, while nine-year-old Oisin has spent the past year compiling lore for his similarly excellent deep fantasy series,<em> Ice, Fire, War</em>.</p><p>I’ve had many conversations with them about their works, because passing wisdom to the next generation is the least that should be expected of a famous author like myself. And I can assure you that these interactions are a two-way street. They keep me abreast of updates as they come in, and I heavily imply that their lack of copyright means I can take their best ideas for my own work any time I choose. They’re smart kids, so they get it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/23/seamas-oreilly-my-familys-next-generation-is-full-of-budding-writers">Continue reading...</a>

In failing to regulate the food sector, successive governments have allowed industry giants to flood the market with products that make us ill<p>Britain’s system for producing and distributing the food we eat is not working. Last week, we learned that UK <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/apr/19/why-are-uk-food-prices-up-by-19-and-which-foods-are-worst-affected" title="">food prices rose</a> an astonishing 19.1% in the year to March. Yes, they are rising everywhere, but faster in Britain – over 2022, 40% higher than in the EU. There are frequent shortages of key products. Two million people used food banks last year. British consumers eat more cheaper, fatty food than other Europeans. As a result, <a href="https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publication/tackling-obesity" title="">nearly one in three is now classified as obese</a>, the highest in Europe besides Malta and Turkey. Five million people are estimated to be at risk of contracting type 2 diabetes, with all the risks that entails.</p><p>Every malfunction of British capitalism and the British state has combined in a perfect storm, fuelled by the way the laissez-faire consensus – inflamed by the rightwing media – frames our understanding of society. We are unhealthier, at greater risk of dying early and facing a deeper cost of living crisis than our peers in the EU. People should be as angry as hell. This, rather than the small boats influx, should be at the heart of our national conversation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/23/britain-has-obesity-crisis-we-wont-solve-it-until-start-listening-to-nanny">Continue reading...</a>

Orbach is one of the world’s best-known psychotherapists, lecturing internationally, advising organisations ranging from the NHS to the World Bank, and helping patients who have included Diana, Princess of Wales. The daughter of an American teacher and a Labour MP, Orbach grew up in London, where she still lives and works.</p><p><strong>What do you remember about writing </strong><em><strong>Fat Is a Feminist Issue</strong></em><strong>?<br /></strong>It came out of youth – I was 29 and I wouldn’t know how to write that way any more. I would have written it as a pamphlet but Joe, my then husband, said don’t be ridiculous, you need to write it as a book. It took just six months.

<p>Amazon’s Cronenberg remake brings fresh gruesome thrills, but ITV’s dramatisation of the 2010 manhunt feels flat</p><p>I’ll tell you about <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/placeholder_title/dp/B0B8TKLW4L">Dead Ringers</a></strong>, created by Alice Birch (who co-adapted <em>Normal People</em><em> </em>and has written for<em> Succession</em>), once I’ve removed my safety goggles and had a piping hot shower. There’s no stinting on reproductive gore in this Amazon Prime Video six-part remake of David Cronenberg’s psychological thriller about twin gynaecologists descending into mania. The 1988 film, starring Jeremy Irons, featured surgical instruments so misshapen and disturbing it was difficult to watch without squirming, but nor is this remodel for the faint-hearted. Babies pound out of vaginas; arms delve biceps-deep into oozing caesarean slits. I haven’t seen this much gushing blood since the lift scene in <em>The Shining</em>. Here is the miracle of life writ large as a fecund battlefield. Birch seems on a mission to do for childbirth what <em>Normal People</em> did for sex: as near as dammit show it for real.</p><p>You could be forgiven for groaning “not another reimagined” old film! But the new series doesn’t aim to be a dead ringer, as it were, for the original. It’s gender-swapped, with Rachel Weisz playing the female gynaecologist twins: domineering, drug-addled, sexually predatory Elliot (all flowing mane and punk sizzle) and the tense, subdued lesbian Beverley (hair yanked back; soon shown miscarrying her own pregnancy). They act as one when skewering a drooling sexist oaf (“Is your imagination so fucked you have to see everything twice before your dick gets hard?”), when they swap identities for Elliot to procure a new lover (Britne Oldford) for Beverley, and in getting their precious birthing centre funded. Then there is the sickly sweet toxicity of their twindom, the chokehold of co-dependence.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/23/the-week-in-tv-dead-ringers-the-hunt-for-raoul-moat-the-diplomat-our-changing-planet-reviews">Continue reading...</a>

It is really good and not even (relatively) that high in sugar. The 25g is perfect, you can eat the whole bar knowing it’s not a doorstep size.</p><p><strong>Sur Chocolates</strong>, famous for their alfajores, have launched some new products, which I shall be covering in the weeks to come.

Netflix’s drama about the Egyptian queen highlights how ideas of race have evolved<p>In 1751, the great American polymath Benjamin Franklin worried about the small number of “purely white People in the World”. <a href="https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Franklin/01-04-02-0080" title="">“All Africa,” he wrote, “is black or tawny</a>. Asia chiefly tawny... And in Europe, the Spaniards, Italians, French, Russians and Swedes, are generally of what we call a swarthy Complexion; as are the Germans also.” Only “the Saxons… [and] the English make the principal Body of White People on the Face of the Earth.”</p><p>The question of “who is white?” might seem to us today as self-evident. Yet it has over the past three centuries been fiercely contested. Many groups we now think of as white were certainly not seen as such for much of that period, from the Irish to the Slavs, from Italians to Jews. It took a long process of social negotiation and conflict before they were admitted into the club of whiteness.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/23/when-cleopatra-was-alive-she-wasnt-categorised-by-colour-of-her-skin">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This deftly constructed account of the IRA’s 1984 attempt to kill the prime minister leaves us with one insistent question: what would have happened if they had succeeded?</p><p>At 2.54am on 12 October 1984, a bomb, which had been concealed in room 629 of the Grand hotel in Brighton several weeks earlier, detonated with such force that it toppled one of the hotel’s five-ton Victorian chimney stacks. “Like a monstrous guillotine, it sliced through concrete, steel and wood, all the way to the ground floor,” writes Rory Carroll in <em>Killing Thatcher</em>, his meticulously rendered account of the IRA’s most audacious terrorist operation.</p><p>Just two minutes before the bomb went off, its primary target, Margaret Thatcher, emerged from the bathroom of the Napoleon suite on the first floor to continue working on various government documents that required her attention. Had she lingered there a little while longer, she would, as Carroll puts it, “have been cut to ribbons, perhaps fatally” by the lethal trajectory of the falling debris. Others in Thatcher’s extended retinue, who had gathered for the Conservatives’ annual conference, were not so lucky. Five people were killed, including the MP and deputy chief whip Sir Anthony Berry, and Lady Jeanne Shattock, the wife of a local party chairman, who was decapitated by the full force of the blast. Margaret Tebbit, wife of the prominent minister Norman Tebbit, was among the seriously injured, having fallen through four floors. She was left paralysed from the waist down.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/23/killing-thatcher-by-rory-carroll-review-meticulous-account-of-the-brighton-bombing-the-ira-the-manhunt">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As the Swan of Avon celebrates his birthday on Sunday, the actor pays tribute to a ‘miraculous’ book that rescued plays such as The Tempest and Macbeth from oblivion</p><p>This Sunday, 23 April, St George’s Day, traditionally Shakespeare’s birthday, 12 copies of the exceedingly rare first edition of his plays will go on public view around the country. The book first appeared in print under the title of Mr William Shakespeares Comedies, Histories, &amp; Tragedies in 1623, seven years after the author’s death. Known as the First Folio, it is the apple of auctioneers’ eyes. The initial print run was for 750 copies; only just under a third of them are known, though every two or three years another will emerge, in various states of disrepair, to the enormous enrichment of its owner. The Folger Library in Washington DC, determinedly collecting copies between 1893 and 1928, has no less than 82, a third of all known copies worldwide; in the British Isles there are 50.</p><p>This book, the purpose of which was to collate all of Shakespeare’s plays into one readily accessible volume, was single-handedly responsible for the survival of 18 plays which would otherwise certainly have disappeared from view, among them such trifles as The Tempest, Julius Caesar, Twelfth Night, Measure for Measure, All’s Well That Ends Well, Antony and Cleopatra, As You Like It, Coriolanus and Macbeth<em>.</em> The editors’ declared intention was to publish the plays “according to the True Originall Copies”, replacing “stol’n and surreptitious copies, maimed and deformed by frauds and stealths of injurious impostors”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/23/my-eyes-filled-with-tears-my-voice-shook-simon-callow-on-coming-face-to-face-with-shakespeares-first-folio">Continue reading...</a>

It reflects his belief in the alchemical power of art to transform the everyday – “if only for a moment, making the mundane profound”. He did, however, consider several other alternative titles for the book, including “That’s Not Art”, “Call That Art?” and “You Can’t Do That”<em>, </em>all of which are things people have said to him about his work.</p><p>While most conceptual artists probably accept that a certain degree of public bemusement comes with the turf, Deller is that rare thing: a conceptualist who feels the need to explain his art. “I do, yes,” he says, nodding, when we sit down to chat amid the organised clutter of the office of his flat overlooking north London’s Holloway Road, where he does most of his thinking and planning. “I’m aware that a lot of artists don’t, but I come from the approachable, rather than the obscure, school. To me, my work is quite obvious in a way, more obvious than a lot of contemporary art, but it is definitely conceptual insofar as I start with an idea and see what happens. That still unsettles people who expect art to be on gallery walls.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/23/jeremy-deller-art-is-magic-stonehenge-murdoch-orgreave-interview">Continue reading...</a>

Scandal after scandal has left our democracy in extremely poor health<p>And another one bites the dust. Dominic Raab is the third man to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/apr/21/dominic-raab-resigns-as-deputy-pm-after-bullying-allegations" title="">exit the cabinet</a> during Rishi Sunak’s six months at Number 10 and the umpteenth minister to be sacked or compelled to quit during the long years of Conservative government. He was the deputy prime minister. That’s a big title, his departure has generated large headlines and he’s not gone quietly into the night, banging the door behind him with a lot of uncontrite noise about being <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/apr/21/dominic-raab-resignation-letter-rishi-sunak-reply-full" title="">treated unfairly</a>.</p><p>Yet his fall will probably merit only a small paragraph in the histories of these years. I say that because resignations have been so common. Bullying, sexual predation, cronyism, rule-busting, law-breaking, illicit lobbying for commercial interests. Name a genre of bad behaviour and these years have served it up. All political eras have their share of scandal. The distinguishing characteristic of this one is that there have been so many of them and of so many different types.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/23/dominic-raab-is-just-the-latest-culprit-the-public-have-lost-faith-in-all-politicians">Continue reading...</a>

## Hydrating face masks: 10 of the best

For fresher, plumper skin, choose a mask that delivers a burst of moisture<p>A large part of my job, as you know, is trying out a plethora of beauty products. It is why every beauty editor has a “beauty wardrobe”. But a beauty wardrobe can, frustratingly, work exactly like its sartorial counterpart. Every so often you notice gaps (“The perfect white shirt would make all the difference”), duds (“There’s a reason that knitted yellow skirt/cropped iridescent jacket/5in slingback was on sale”) and multiples (“Surely no one needs 10 black sweatshirts?”) Multiples of masks that do more or less the same thing – resurfacing, exfoliating, pore refining – is what I noticed in my beauty wardrobe a few months back. Having masks that perform this task is not a bad thing – this is a great way to say goodbye to dullness and dead skin. But it’s a fine balance. Everyone is obsessed with getting a glow, but over-exfoliating can play havoc with your hydration levels and destabilise your skin. This is where a restorative hydrating mask comes in. It provides a surge of moisture – be it in 20 minutes or overnight – that leaves you with balanced, plumper, juicy skin that radiates “I’ve just had a really expensive facial.” And if you still want to exfoliate the skin and unclog the pores, that’s fine; just slow down and remember that many masks – like Glow Recipe, which resurfaces the skin as well as hydrates – are excellent multitaskers.</p><p><strong>1.

Solve the climate crisis, cure disease? Maybe not, but with eyelash serum more beautiful eyes are possible<p>I’d barely thought about my eyelashes at all. Which is odd, really, considering I feel like in my four decades of existence I’ve thought about most things at least twice, matters of my body and self many many more, and more again at night. No, I’d taken these hairs for granted, that they would remain, protect, flap prissily around in their little mascara dressing gowns until, one day last month, I received an email about an eyelash serum.</p><p>Eyelash serum. It’s one of those things that just appeared fully formed in the mid-2000s, a mushroom that grew overnight. It was not there; our eyelashes grew without it. It became; our eyelashes required feeding at the roots. A withering cynic at the best of times, I had paid no attention. This was the era of the maxi-lash, extensions that ranged from Bambi to shelf-like, the size of black canapés or iPhones – the eyelash industry was worth over $1.5bn. I did take part, briefly. When I tried fake lashes I found the process tedious and the experience disturbing, my eyes heavy as if counting down an anaesthetic, so I’d sworn off the whole eyelash project, content with my lot. But when I received the serum email, I looked in the mirror, half-interested again, and good God. Good. God. Looking at the sparse field where great vines once grew, I felt first, horror, then a shiver of excitement. A project. I bought the serum.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/apr/23/the-eva-wiseman-column-fixing-the-worlds-problems-one-eyelash-at-a-time">Continue reading...</a>

## How to Blow Up a Pipeline review – a gripping, of-the-moment eco-thriller

<p>Set in Texas, Daniel Goldhaber’s tense drama probes the moral complexity of the act – if not the consequences – of a group of protesters sabotaging the oil industry’s infrastructure</p><p>It’s a charged word, terrorism. It’s unsettling, challenging, alarming. And this is something that Daniel Goldhaber’s propulsive eco-thriller <em>How </em><em>to Blow Up </em><em>a Pipeline</em> smartly acknowledges. Even on the eve of a radical act of violent protest – the destruction of two sections of Texas’s oil infrastructure – some of the environmental activists behind the plan are reluctant to use the term. Rowan (Kristine Froseth), a 22-year-old from Portland, Oregon, prefers to think of herself as a “revolutionary” or “gamechanger”. Other members draw parallels with the Boston Tea Party or the civil rights movement. But Theo (Sasha Lane), a young woman from a poisoned suburb of Long Beach, California, is under no illusions. “They’re gonna call us terrorists. Because we are doing terrorism.” Her terminal cancer diagnosis, the consequence of a childhood growing up in the shadow of an oil refinery, means that Theo is done with tiptoeing around the truth, however unpleasant it might be.</p><p>This debate, lubricated by liquor and loosened by night-before nerves, is a pivotal moment that comes some 30 minutes into the film. It’s a scene that concedes that yes, these characters are extremists whose actions will have potentially devastating consequences. But it also takes an empathic view, making the case that, ultimately, these are ordinary people impelled to act by the extraordinary circumstances in which they find themselves. It’s morally complex territory – the knotty ethical issues that underpin the tautly executed action have some parallels with those of <em>Paradise Now</em>, Hany Abu-Assad’s largely sympathetic portrait of a pair of Palestinian suicide bombers. It’s worth noting, however, that <em>Pipeline</em>’s protagonists are scrupulous about targeting infrastructure rather than people. “We’re not murderers,” stresses Rowan, when her feckless pot-head boyfriend, Logan (Lukas Gage), suggests that anyone who works for an oil company is fair game.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/23/how-to-blow-up-a-pipeline-review-eco-thriller-texas-oil">Continue reading...</a>

## Rupert Murdoch was ever a master strategist, but he’s beginning to lose his grip | John Naughton

The $787m Fox News settlement was money well spent in saving the media mogul from an embarrassing ordeal<p>There are, as F Scott Fitzgerald famously observed – and as Rupert Murdoch is now belatedly discovering, “no second acts in American lives”. Last week, just as the trial of the $1.6bn <a href="https://time.com/6270521/fox-dominion-lawsuit-defamation-trial/" title="">defamation action brought by Dominion against Fox News</a> was about to start, a “settlement” was reached between the two parties.

Otherwise he would have had to testify under oath and the world would see not the robust titan of popular legend but an elderly mogul who is physically frail and, more importantly, who could not stop his TV station pandering to Donald Trump for fear of alienating the audience that had turned Fox News into such a profitable cash cow.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/23/rupert-murdoch-was-ever-a-master-strategist-but-hes-beginning-to-lose-his-grip">Continue reading...</a>

## Boomers, you’ve done OK – but don’t expect undying affection from us millennials | Martha Gill

Younger people can only watch in envy as some 50-year-olds are tempted into golden early retirement<p>The marshmallow test was invented when the boomer generation was young. It tested the ability to <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fh0029815" title="">delay gratification</a>. Children who could hold off eating a marshmallow placed in front of them would get two, proving they had the self-control requisite to become concert cellists, scientific geniuses or presidents of the US.</p><p>But over the years, psychologists have come to doubt the marshmallow test and what it was really measuring. They found that children who had grown up around <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797618761661" title="">unpredictable adults</a> – or who were primed with a broken promise <a href="http://www.rochester.edu/news/show.php?id=4622" title="">ahead of the test</a> – were most likely to grab the first sweet that came their way. This wasn’t always impulse failure, as once assumed, so much as a rational reaction to circumstance. In an uncertain world, it is much smarter not to trust in romantic promises of marshmallows tomorrow. You might end up with none at all. The first lesson – sacrifice pays off – has been drummed into boomers, and the following generation X, all their lives, but life is repeatedly teaching their children the second. We can do everything right and still not get our second marshmallow. Sometimes, even our first is whipped away right in front of us, as we are asked to please stop whining; we shouldn’t have expected so much in the first place.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/23/boomers-done-ok-but-dont-expect-undying-affection-from-us-millennials">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Life is comedy and tragedy’: Daphne Guinness on her remarkable journey from muse to musician

<p>Daphne Guinness has had the most lurid and surreal life. She talks about being kidnapped aged five, marrying a shipping magnate at 19, working with David Bowie, and finally finding peace in the recording studio</p><p>People have some wild ideas about Daphne Guinness, but the oddest one she’s ever seen, on Wikipedia, stated that she was in league with the devil. The evidence? The strange, hoof shapes of her favoured platform shoes that she wears everywhere. “But they’d also managed to find a picture of me drinking tomato juice, so they claimed that it was the blood of children and that I was in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/25/qanon-conspiracy-theory-explained-trump-what-is" title="">QAnon</a> and had two secret QAnon children,” she says, amused but baffled by the lengths people will go to. She’s speaking over Zoom from the Caribbean where she’s brighter and smilier than I had expected from the frosty fashion photos that exist of her. “I mean, seriously, Americans are pretty weird,” she adds.</p><p>Still, it’s not as if anyone needs to invent stories about her. Part of the Guinness brewing dynasty, but also the Mitfords, a family of English aristocrats, Daphne grew up not realising her beloved granny, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/aug/14/guardianobituaries.thefarright" title="">Diana Mosley</a>, had been married to this country’s leading fascist, and once got into trouble at school after happily identifying him as a relative on TV. (She has since decried his politics entirely.) Her father, Jonathan Guinness, a British peer, had sets of children by three different women. One lot was a surprise to Daphne, though they’re all friends now, she says. When he was married to Daphne’s mother, Suzanne, Jonathan bought a former monastery up a dirt track on a Spanish mountain, near to the home of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/dali" title="">Salvador Dalí</a>, who kept lobsters in his swimming pool. The Guinnesses spent several months a year there, with no electricity and no car. Daphne’s bed was beside the monastery’s altar. She spent a lot of time in caves, playing with hornets, or getting advice from Dalí, her mother’s great friend, on how to be naughty.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/23/life-is-comedy-and-tragedy-the-lurid-and-surreal-life-of-daphne-guinness-muse-and-musician">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Neutral and tonal shades giving you a fresh, elevated and adaptable wardrobe this spring</p><p>A tonal wardrobe where everything is interchangeable makes getting dressed easier, from white and ivory through to taupe and brown, it’s a palette that works all year round. Beloved by celebrities, neutral shades semaphore luxury and effortless style, see Chris Pine arriving at Jimmy Kimmel Live! recently in a silky beige lounge set. It’s no coincidence that arguably the best menswear wardrobe on TV – George in Netflix’s Beef, played by Joseph Lee – features more than one tonal neutral ensemble (shout out to the cream fleece look!) and an array of covetable knitwear, including a beige tie-front cardigan by Japanese brand Batoner.</p><p>Get the minimal look for less with YMC’s Earth collection, comprising timeless staples made using natural, organic or recycled materials, and Gant’s vacation edit ticks all the right boxes. On the high street Arket (1, below) has nailed the Scandi meets Calabasas look, only it’s machine washable, ditto John Lewis’s carpenter jeans (2), the quality of which belies the price tag. Layer up shades with a tank top under a blazer (yes, vests are back) or an untucked shirt under a sweater. Mix in darker colours like Topman’s broderie anglais shirt (5) or try head-to-toe monotone – if you’re somewhere sunny, white always works. Don’t forget the crisp trainers, keep them looking boxfresh with Crep Protect shoe wipes (£7).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/apr/23/cream-of-the-crop-new-season-neutrals-for-men">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A mother’s frank and heartfelt tale of trying to free her son – labelled ‘Jihadi Jack’ by the press – from a Kurdish jail is the stuff of nightmares</p><p>It is nearly a decade since Sally Lane received the phone call that changed her life for ever. It came from her elder son, Jack Letts, then 18, who had been travelling in Jordan on a gap-year trip from their home in Oxford. “Mum, I’m in Syria,” Jack said, beginning a chain of events that saw Lane lose her home and her job and, for a time, her freedom. Jack was calling from Raqqa, where he had gone in search of a Muslim caliphate he had fatefully, adolescently, come to idealise, before the horrors of Islamic State were known to the world.</p><p>“It is difficult to describe the terror of knowing your child is in the most dangerous place on earth and there is nothing you can do about it,” Lane writes in her frank and clear-eyed account of the years that followed. Her book is a tale of survival and an account of the legal process that consumed her and her husband, John Letts, in the name of counter-terrorism. The thread that runs through the story is Lane’s maternal refusal to give up on a son who became known as a pariah across the world (“Jihadi Jack” as he was christened in 2016 by a <em>Sunday Times</em> journalist) and who was subsequently stripped of citizenship by a government more concerned with headlines than justice. A son who remains to this day in a Kurdish prison, long convicted in the public mind, with scant evidence, of association with crimes against humanity.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/23/reasonable-cause-to-suspect-by-sally-lane-review-mothers-ordeal-to-save-her-son-from-kurdish-prison-jack-letts-islamic-state">Continue reading...</a>

Might we see a loneliness in the single bottle of Coke, unfinished, its label picked at nervously? Is that anxiety confirmed or denied by the ashtray full of fag ends, too many for one sitting? The Carling logo threatens to locate the scene in a particular time and place – the pub garden tables of the 1970s, for those of us who remember them. But the Coke bottle is plastic, pastiching the iconic glass, so this is a tired reminder of that already tired decade. Still, the soft cocktail hour light draws us in. We might think we know it from a hundred adverts – “the real thing” – but the Coke dregs, the unscrewed cap, the unemptied ashtray, don’t want to sell us anything.

Yet all this potential is set at risk by <a href="https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2023/country-chapters/india" title="">Modi’s divisive</a> and destructive actions.

## Success for women need not be the same as for men | Letters

In our patriarchal society, succeeding is usually defined in financial terms. It’s time we changed the game<p>Martha Gill identifies that women are intelligent enough to learn lessons from the negative experience of (so-called) high-achieving women and avoid following a similar path (“<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/15/good-reason-strong-female-role-models-deter-other-women-from-aiming-for-the-top" title="">There’s good reason why strong female role models deter other women from aiming for the top</a>”, Comment). She refers to the patriarchal system within which such “successful” women are operating. That surely is the key issue. No less than men, women want to succeed in life. But for many – even most – the definition of what constitutes success is not the same as that proffered within the patriarchal system.</p><p>The women’s liberation movement has striven for women to gain access into the male game and identified as successful those women who rise to the top playing by those rules. That was understandable as a beginning, given that a critical first step for women was financial independence. But 50 years on, that is no longer enough for many women. Success defined in narrow patriarchal (usually financial) terms is not something they necessarily consider worth striving for. The game needs to change and so become worth playing. That is today’s challenge for the women’s liberation movement.<br /><strong>Johanna Nixon</strong><br />Harrow, London<br /></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2023/apr/23/success-for-women-not-same-as-for-men-letters">Continue reading...</a>

## The Observer view on Dominic Raab’s resignation and bullying in Westminster | Observer editorial

Until Rishi Sunak and all party leaders value integrity above loyalty, the Commons will continue to be a toxic place to work<p>Bullying should never be tolerated in the workplace. While there is no legal definition, bullying is generally understood as a pattern of intimidating or offensive behaviour that undermines or denigrates <a href="https://www.tuc.org.uk/guidance/what-bullying-work" title="">the person experiencing it</a>. It can have pernicious impacts on their physical health and mental wellbeing, and undermines performance at work. So it is absolutely right that the deputy prime minister, Dominic Raab, resigned from the cabinet after an <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1152026/2023.04.20_Investigation_Report_to_the_Prime_Minister.pdf" title="">independent investigation</a> found he had bullied civil servants in the Foreign Office and Ministry of Justice. But the manner of Raab’s resignation, and the way it was accepted by the prime minister, raises serious questions about the government’s commitment to improving the workplace culture across Whitehall.</p><p>The investigation was carried out by Adam Tolley KC after formal complaints were made by civil servants about Raab’s conduct while foreign and justice secretary. Because Tolley undertook to protect the anonymity of the civil servants who made the complaints, his report contains <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1152026/2023.04.20_Investigation_Report_to_the_Prime_Minister.pdf" title="">limited details of his investigation</a>. But Tolley found that Raab acted in a way that was intimidating by way of “unreasonably and persistently aggressive conduct”, and that he introduced “an unwarranted punitive element”. His conduct was inevitably experienced as undermining or humiliating by the official in question. He referred to the civil service code in a meeting in a way that could be understood as suggesting that those in the meeting had breached their employment contracts, conveying “a sense of unspecified disciplinary action”. He also acted in an intimidating manner through providing unconstructive critical feedback. Tolley also found that the civil servants who came forward to complain were acting in good faith and were “sincere and committed, with no ulterior agenda”. He said several had suffered stress and anxiety that they believed was related to Raab’s conduct, and he praised junior civil servants for their courage in coming forward.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/23/the-observer-view-on-dominic-raabs-resignation-and-bullying-in-westminster">Continue reading...</a>

It’s part of the Outernet development, on the corner of London’s Charing Cross Road. Deep in the basement there’s a 2,000-capacity music venue.

<p>There’s a fashion for very pale rosé, but in these still unpredictable days of spring, a darker pink fits</p><p><strong>Jerôme Lacondemine Vol de l’Hirondelle</strong><strong> Rosé</strong><strong>, Beaujolais, France 2020 </strong><strong>(</strong><strong>£18.60, <a href="https://www.alpinewines.co.uk/beaujolais-villages-rose-vol-de-l-hirondelle.html" title="">Alpine Wines</a></strong><strong>)</strong><strong> </strong>Provence has made itself synonymous with rosé of a certain stylish kind. It’s the home of the pale pink watercolour wash, presented in clear glass bottles that would not look out of place behind the perfume counter, and of cult brands – Whispering Angel, Miraval, Galoupet – that are touched with the same kind of celebrity-adjacent haute couture glitz you find in Champagne. There is very much more to Provence rosé and I’ll be picking out some of my favourites of the region’s latest releases later in the summer. But as we enter what I think of as rosé season – that moment when it becomes plausible to drink a cold glass or two outside of an evening – I’m looking elsewhere for my first few pink hits of the year, starting with a pale, elegant, delectably strawberry-scented and cream-textured example from a part of France that I don’t usually associate with rosé, Beaujolais.</p><p><strong>Contesa Cerasuolo d’Abruzzo Rosato, Italy 2022 </strong><strong>(</strong><strong>£8.95, <a href="https://www.thewinesociety.com/product/cerasuolo-dabruzzo-contesa-2022" title="">The Wine Society</a></strong><strong>)</strong><strong> </strong>Another French region with a strong rosé tradition is the Loire. In the vineyards around the village of Sancerre in the Central Loire, pinot noir is the base for the gorgeously ripe cherry-scented, redcurrant-racy Domaine Philippe Raimbault Apud Sariacum Sancerre Rosé 2021 (£21.95, <a href="https://www.cheerswinemerchants.co.uk/products/domaine-philippe-raimbault-sancerre-rose" title="">cheerswinemerchants.co.uk</a>; <a href="https://flagshipwines.co.uk/product/domaine-philippe-raimbault-sancerre-rose/" title="">flagshipwines.co.uk</a>) – a very smart choice for salmon or trout. Farther west, in Touraine, gamay, the same red grape as used in Beaujolais, makes the bright, crisp, brisk and refreshing Guy Allion Touraine Rosé 2021 (£15.50, <a href="https://emilewines.co.uk/collections/guy-allion/products/guy-allion-chant-de-lune-touraine-rose-2020-touraine-loire" title="">emilewines.co.uk</a>), while gamay, cabernet franc and grolleau come together in Anjou for Champteloup Rosé d’Anjou 2021 (£8.99, <a href="https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/champteloup-rose-danjou-loire-france/037209-18646-18647" title="">Waitrose</a>), which, with its cushion of sugar and ripe strawberry character, is at its best with light but spicy food such as Thai salads. Over in central Italy, meanwhile, Contesa Cerasulo d’Abruzzo is no less food-friendly, although in this case its more robust, candied berry character (and darker colour) makes a great match for a fresh tomato pasta (spaghetti al pomodoro crudo).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/apr/23/rose-tinted-glasses-the-season-of-pink-wine-begins">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This riotous and engaging biography has it all: two brothers at each other’s throats, two wives who loathe each other, and the duke’s ill-advised visit to Germany</p><p>Netflix’s<em> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-crown">The Crown</a> </em>has revolutionised the way we view the royal family, triangulating as it does between three competing sources: the truth, fiction and rumour. When we mourned the Queen last year, many of us, I think, will have intermixed memories of her from real life with the far more intimate and revealing portraits we got from <em>The Crown</em>. The royal family and their various hangers-on are burnished in the series by their place in a stream of narrative, the jagged edges of real life smoothed; they are summoned into life by a kind of communal act of magical thinking.</p><p>All of this, of course, presents a challenge for the royal biographer. We come to this family and their story with expectations of drama and revelation, entertainment and scandal. And yet it is a family that seeks – with a few notable exceptions – to maintain an air of haughty secretiveness, revealing as little as possible of its inner workings.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/23/the-windsors-at-war-by-alexander-larman-review-rollicking-account-of-the-king-the-duke-and-the-nazis-threat-to-the-crown">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Russian missiles damage buildings in Kharkiv city; Moscow claims capture of three more areas of Bakhmut; evacuations after explosive found at Belgorod</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia+ukraine">See all our Russia-Ukraine war coverage</a></li></ul><p><strong>At least five Russian missiles hit the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv</strong> and surrounding districts late on Saturday night, damaging civilian buildings, local officials said. One missile hit a house in the village of Kotliary, just to the south of Kharkiv, while another caused a fire in the city itself, said the regional governor, Oleh Sinegubov.</p><p><strong>Russia’s defence ministry claimed it had captured another three districts in the western part of Bakhmut</strong> in eastern Ukraine. Troops who have continued into the heavily contested city are thought to be part of the Wagner group of mercenaries.</p><p><strong>Russia confirmed it would expel 20 German diplomats</strong> in retaliation for its own diplomats being sent home from Berlin, the Tass news agency said, citing Russia’s foreign ministry.</p><p><strong>Seventeen apartment buildings were evacuated in the Russian city of Belgorod after an explosive device was found</strong> at the site blown up by a bomb accidentally dropped by a Russian warplane, authorities said. The explosion on Thursday injured three people in the city near the Ukrainian border. The province’s governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said on Saturday that sappers examining the blast site found and detonated an “explosive object” that was “in the immediate vicinity of residential buildings”. The precautionary evacuations ended later in the day, said Belgorod’s mayor, Valentin Demidov.</p><p><strong>Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has again refused to take sides in the war in Ukraine</strong>, calling for a “negotiated political solution” between Kyiv and Moscow. “We urgently need a group of countries to sit round a table with both Ukraine and Russia,” he said after a meeting with the Portuguese president, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, in Lisbon.</p><p><strong>Units from Belarus returned home from Russia on Saturday after training on how to use the Iskander tactical missile system to launch nuclear weapons</strong>, the Belarusian defence ministry said. It made the announcement exactly four weeks after Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, said Russia would station tactical nuclear weapons in neighbouring Belarus.</p><p><strong>Ukraine plans to deploy software from the US data analytics provider Palantir Technologies</strong> to help it prosecute alleged war crimes committed by Russia, the company has said.</p><p><strong>Ukraine’s operational command has reported that 11 Russian warships are in combat readiness in the Black Sea</strong>, including two submarines armed with Kalibr cruise missiles. The press service of Ukraine’s Operational Command South reported this on Facebook, according to Ukrinform.</p><p><strong>Cyprus has cracked down on those named by the US and Britain for allegedly helping Russian oligarchs bypass sanctions</strong> on Moscow because of the Ukraine war, an official said. The financial commissioner, Pavlos Ioannou, told state broadcaster CyBC on Saturday that assets of the individuals and entities concerned had been frozen.</p><p><strong>Jack Teixeira, the US air national guardsman accused of leaking classified defence documents</strong> to a small group of gamers, posted sensitive information months earlier than previously known and to a much larger chat group, according to the New York Times.</p><p><strong>The</strong> <strong>UK Ministry of Defence has said Russia is struggling to maintain consistency in a core narrative</strong> used to justify the Ukraine war: that the invasion is akin to the Soviet experience during the second world war.</p><p><strong>A Ukrainian soldier who lost his leg and has been fighting on the frontline wearing a prosthesis will run the London Marathon</strong> to raise money and share a message of unity against Russian aggression. Roman Kashpur, from Khmelnyk in Vinnytska, stood on a landmine in 2019. He fought on the frontline in Ukraine wearing a prosthesis for six weeks after Russia’s invasion in February 2022.</p><p><strong>The top Russian official in occupied Crimea said its air defence systems had been activated</strong> but there were no reports of damage or casualties. “Air defence forces worked in the sky over Crimea. No damage or casualties,” the official, Sergei Aksyonov, said on Telegram. “I ask everyone to remain calm and trust only trusted sources of information.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/23/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-424-of-the-invasion">Continue reading...</a>

<p>She called it my ‘therapy time’. Apparently, I was a vastly different style of driving instructor to her friends’ parents</p><p>At the end of our street is a mostly empty car park dotted with bags of dumped McDonald’s rubbish, dying pot plants and graffiti. The council recently installed a bank of charging stations for electric vehicles, so sometimes a line of Teslas is now parked, strangely out-of-place in this mess.</p><p>This car park has been home to many firsts in my family. The first time my son road a bike without training wheels. The first time we carried our cat on a late-night walk in a shopping bag. And the first time my daughter drove a car.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/23/ill-miss-the-hours-sitting-side-by-side-teaching-my-daughter-how-to-drive">Continue reading...</a>
