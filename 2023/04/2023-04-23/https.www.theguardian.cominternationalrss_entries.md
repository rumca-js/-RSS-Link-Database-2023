<p>A stoppage-time goal by forward Giacomo Raspadori earned runaway Serie A leaders Napoli a 1-0 victory at Juventus on Sunday after the hosts had two goals ruled out following VAR reviews.<br /><br />Raspadori came off the bench to fire Napoli 17 points clear on 78 points and they could claim the title next weekend if they beat Salernitana and Lazio fail to win at Internazionale.</p><p>Juve thought they had taken the lead with a stunning solo effort by Ángel Di María in the 82nd minute only to see it cancelled out after a VAR check for Arkadiusz Milik’s tackle on Napoli midfielder Stanislav Lobotka in the build up.<br /><br />Late substitute Dusan Vlahovic then found the net for Juve in added time but his effort was ruled out as well because the ball left the pitch before Federico Chiesa’s cross.<br /><br />Napoli then sealed the win through Raspadori, who beat Juve goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny with a first-time finish following a beautiful lofted cross by midfielder Eljif Elmas.<br /><br /></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/23/juventus-napoli-serie-a-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Jonas Eidevall had said he wanted to see a “complete performance” from his depleted Arsenal in their semi-final first leg away to Wolfsburg.

## A Thousand and One review – Sundance hit cuts deep

<p>The poignant story of an ex-con mother struggling to raise her son amid a changing Harlem is powerfully poignant</p><p>The deserving winner of the grand jury prize at Sundance this year, the directorial debut from AV Rockwell is rather special. Set in Harlem, New York, and spanning from 1994 to 2005, it’s a dual coming-of-age story, simultaneously following a mother – firecracker Inez (an incendiary Teyana Taylor), at the start of the film an impulsive ex-con recently released from Rikers Island prison – and a son, Terry (played by Aaron Kingsley Adetola as a six-year-old, Aven Courtney at 13, Josiah Cross at 17). When Inez reconnects by chance with Terry, he’s a broken little child, already half chewed up by the foster care system. Something in the subdued way that he assumes that abandonment is inevitable cuts deep, triggering Inez’s own memories of a childhood in the care system. She makes a fateful decision and snatches Terry, with little plan other than to be there for him, to make a home for him.</p><p>And against the odds, she succeeds, forging a rocky domestic unit with Lucky (William Catlett). But Inez and Terry are not the only ones changing: the city around them, and in particular Harlem, is being reshaped into a space that no longer feels like home. This is captured visually through Eric Yue’s deft, empathic camerawork, but also through the soundscape around the frame, which evolves from the rowdy bustle of a community into the harder, less welcoming clatter of construction work. Tying it together is a phenomenal score by Gary Gunn. Lush strings pay tribute to the film compositions of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/quincy-jones">Quincy Jones</a>, but even the swell and sweep of the orchestra fails to prepare us for the emotive impact of the final act.</p><p>In cinemas now</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/23/a-thousand-and-one-review-sundance-hit-cuts-deep">Continue reading...</a>

## Saudi politics bleeds into golfing pageantry as Greg Norman brings LIV fever dream to Adelaide

<p>The crowds at LIV Golf in Adelaide this week are proof Australians are so beguiled by Greg Norman they will buy into his Saudi-backed slogan that ‘golf is a force for good’</p><p>In a late 19th-century issue of <em>Vanity Fair</em> a caricature of famous big-bearded cricketer WG Grace carried a caption that read simply ‘Cricket’. In Australia, from about 1980, a Greg Norman version might have read ‘Golf’. The man <em>was</em> Australian golf. He didn’t have to sky-dive from planes to promote tournaments (though he did), his presence was enough. And it still is.</p><p>This weekend Norman has brought LIV Golf to The Grange Golf Club in Adelaide, and Australian sports fans, as ever, appear powerless against his siren song. The golf course is heaving with over 35,000 fans daily. Admission has been sold out for all three rounds. A ticket into the ‘Cellar Door’ marquee back of the 12th green – known as the ‘Watering Hole’ and styled like the PGA Tour’s ‘Party Hole’ in Arizona – is $1200. The hole is surrounded by similar marquees and ‘sky boxes’. After a golfer’s shot, good or bad, plastic beer cups rain onto the tee like frothy white mortars.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/apr/23/saudi-politics-bleeds-into-golfing-pageantry-as-greg-norman-brings-liv-fever-dream-to-adelaide">Continue reading...</a>
