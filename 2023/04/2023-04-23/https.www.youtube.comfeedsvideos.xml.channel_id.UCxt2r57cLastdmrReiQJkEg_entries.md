With the coronation of Charles III just around the corner, I thought I'd celebrate in the only way I know how: by creating a mini-series of videos telling the stories of various rebels, radicals and republicans throughout the centuries who have tried (with varying degrees of success) to consign the British crown to history.

In this first episode of what I'm calling "Treason Fest 2023", we're looking at the one time that Britain has successfully ridded itself of its royal family. Buckle-up for the story of Charles I, Oliver Cromwell and the English Revolution.
