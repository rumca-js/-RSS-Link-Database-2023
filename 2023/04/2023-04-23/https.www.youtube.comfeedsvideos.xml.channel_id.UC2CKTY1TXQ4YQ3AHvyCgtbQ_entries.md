Spring is coming soon (I thought it got here last weekend, but we were tricked) and that's when it's best to build terrain boards for wargaming - you can let paint and glue dry outside and also just enjoy the great outdoors. I'm going to ask for tips, talk about my plans, and of course, I'll answer your wargaming-related questions. Come have fun!

Vince Venturella and I made a game! Check out Reign in Hell - Demonic Skirmish Combat at http://www.reigninhellgame.com

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
