Ccolour was bleached from bathrooms again, avocado suites making way for minimal white sanctuaries. The popularity ofminimalism in of the 1990s led to spa-like bathrooms, their function as much a place of \u201cwellness\u201d as cleanliness. White metro tiles suggested an industrial space, hygienic and pure, and pleasingly modern. Sugg Ryan charts the rise and fall of the coloured bathroom from 1932, when \u201cspeculatively built houses became more affordable and the coloured bathroom suite was a mark of individuality and modernity\u201d. Art Deco geometric styles with black borders led to pastels, \u201clike mint and pink, which were popular into the 1950s when vanity basins became fashionable. Pastels gave way to more muted tones, like beige and the notorious avocado green in the 1970s. The coloured bathroom suite fell out of favour in the 1980s when there was a fad for Victoriana and the return of the freestanding roll-top bath. Until recently, white reigned supreme, combined with built-in storage and beige or grey tiles.\u201d Recently, Sugg Ryan bought a pink sink on impulse, and is very pleased with it.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/23/retro-loos-flushed-with-success-eva-wiseman\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/23/retro-loos-flushed-with-success-eva-wiseman", "date_published": "2023-04-23 14:00:41+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Should I worry about how much sugar I consume?", "description": "<p>Sugary foods are easier to access than ever and designed to keep us coming back for more.

He\u2019s not the first of our family\u2019s second generation to follow me in this path. Since outing myself as an author, more than a few of my nephews and nieces have sought to outdo my efforts, often with nerve-jangling success. On a trip to Worthing last month, my nephew Daniel sneered quite derisively when I told him it had taken me three years to write my book, since he\u2019d written two that weekend alone. My niece Anna wrote a novel \u2013 with the enviable title of <em>Two Children, Millions of Doors and Good and Evil </em>\u2013 that was jarringly readable, while nine-year-old Oisin has spent the past year compiling lore for his similarly excellent deep fantasy series,<em> Ice, Fire, War</em>.</p><p>I\u2019ve had many conversations with them about their works, because passing wisdom to the next generation is the least that should be expected of a famous author like myself. And I can assure you that these interactions are a two-way street. They keep me abreast of updates as they come in, and I heavily imply that their lack of copyright means I can take their best ideas for my own work any time I choose. They\u2019re smart kids, so they get it.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/23/seamas-oreilly-my-familys-next-generation-is-full-of-budding-writers\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/23/seamas-oreilly-my-familys-next-generation-is-full-of-budding-writers", "date_published": "2023-04-23 08:31:34+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Britain has an obesity crisis.

His conduct was inevitably experienced as undermining or humiliating by the official in question. He referred to the civil service code in a meeting in a way that could be understood as suggesting that those in the meeting had breached their employment contracts, conveying \u201ca sense of unspecified disciplinary action\u201d. He also acted in an intimidating manner through providing unconstructive critical feedback.
