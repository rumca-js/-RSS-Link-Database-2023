Its back for another video! This iPhone 12 Pro Max was found on the side of a highway being left for several days in the rain. Likely also being ran over at least once. In the last video we tracked down its owner and reached out to him in several ways, but 6 months on and he never claimed the phone. So being left with it I am taking it upon myself to fix it up!
