Set in Harlem, New York, and spanning from 1994 to 2005, it\u2019s a dual coming-of-age story, simultaneously following a mother \u2013 firecracker Inez (an incendiary Teyana Taylor), at the start of the film an impulsive ex-con recently released from Rikers Island prison \u2013 and a son, Terry (played by Aaron Kingsley Adetola as a six-year-old, Aven Courtney at 13, Josiah Cross at 17). When Inez reconnects by chance with Terry, he\u2019s a broken little child, already half chewed up by the foster care system. Something in the subdued way that he assumes that abandonment is inevitable cuts deep, triggering Inez\u2019s own memories of a childhood in the care system. She makes a fateful decision and snatches Terry, with little plan other than to be there for him, to make a home for him.</p><p>And against the odds, she succeeds, forging a rocky domestic unit with Lucky (William Catlett). But Inez and Terry are not the only ones changing: the city around them, and in particular Harlem, is being reshaped into a space that no longer feels like home. This is captured visually through Eric Yue\u2019s deft, empathic camerawork, but also through the soundscape around the frame, which evolves from the rowdy bustle of a community into the harder, less welcoming clatter of construction work.
