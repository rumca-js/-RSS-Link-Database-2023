The bearded suspect uses she/her pronouns and one of the cops thinks that's ridiculous. In a good cop/bad cop scenario, he would be a bad cop.

And as a seaside resort, Blackpool is not short of seagulls. However, the seagulls are proving to be a bit of a nuisance when it comes to trying to steal food from our visitors and our animal enclosures! </em><em>We need to do what we can to keep the seagulls away from our main visitor dining areas, which is why we are looking for a team of people to join our Visitor Services team as 'Seagull Deterrents.'\"</em></p><p>The zoo is located just a few miles off the coast, which is why it has such an issue with pesky seagulls. The zoo also has more than 1,350 animals, drawing huge crowds of people - and a looot of food for seagulls to feast on. </p><p>I don't really understand how this works as a deterrent. Do the seagulls recognize the giant humanoid seagull as their leader? Can they even tell it looks like a bird? It seems like the zoo is just trying to make its workers do it for the fun of it. And it does look quite ridiculous. </p><p>But, according to at least one Trip Advisor review, it seems they've exhausted other measures: <em>\"Compared to other zoos that we have visited, Blackpool Zoo was enjoyable but not exceptional. The zoo has a major problem with seagulls dive bombing the area surrounding the caf\u00e9/restaurant - this was unsettling for some families, especially, the children. The zoo has put up 'dummy' falcons/hawks on the roof of the establishment but this is not working. The zoo will have to become more creative in dealing with a serious problem.\"</em> And that they did, my friends. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Lily is a Zoomer college dropout who somehow landed a writing gig here at LwC.com.
