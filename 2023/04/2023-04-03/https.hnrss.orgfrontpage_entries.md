## Launch HN: OutSail (YC W23) – Wingsails to reduce cargo ship fuel consumption

<p>Hi HN! I’m Joseph, and along with Arpan and Bailey we are the founders of OutSail Shipping (<a href="https://outsailshipping.com/">https://outsailshipping.com/</a>). We’re building a sail the size of a 747 that rolls up into a shipping container. When deployed, it will generate thrust from the wind to reduce the fuel consumption of a cargo ship. An array of these devices will reduce fuel consumption on ships by up to 20%. These sails are easily stowed and removed to cause no interference with cargo operations. Here’s a short video showing our prototype: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUpVqzpym54">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUpVqzpym54</a>.<p>Sails powered ships for millennia; but then the convenience of energy-dense fuels displaced sails. As ship speeds eventually exceeded wind speeds, the consensus became that sails had no place in shipping and were relegated to hobbyists and sport. Fast forward a century and a half, and maritime shipping, like all other industries, is facing a reckoning to mitigate the greenhouse gasses produced by their activities.<p>The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has introduced new regulations which use a vessel’s Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) to grade ships. This grading scale becomes more aggressive over time, and any ship with a poor grade must take corrective action. The corrective actions can be as non-invasive as reducing speed (aka: slow steaming) or as extreme as a retrofit to use a different, cleaner fuel source. This costs millions and takes a ship out of commission for months, and it’s difficult to ensure your (now more expensive) fuel is available at every port of call. Ship owners are hedging their bets that slow steaming will dominate their future, with ship order books full to reflect the increased capacity needed when containers take 20% longer to cross the ocean.<p>Or option three. There is sufficient wind on the ocean to power the entire shipping industry, if you’re willing to grab it. Wind Assisted Ship Propulsion (WASP) devices can be used as a corrective action to improve a vessel’s CII rating, without reducing ship speed or changing the route. In other words, a return of sails.<p>We are   hardware engineers with over two decades of experience between us, working at Tesla, SpaceX, JPL, Relativity, and some startups. The idea for OutSail came from Arpan and Joseph getting coffee after work one day. When we asked each other “What would you do if you weren’t building satellites?” maritime cargo came up from both sides; Arpan from having studied the industry for opportunities to reduce emissions, and Joseph from a love of hydrodynamics and maybe too many sea-shanties. Bailey and Arpan, meanwhile, had been looking at working on bicycling infrastructure. What brought the three of us together was actually a Dungeons & Dragons game where we realized we made a good team! We settled on OutSail as a good fit for our hardware hacking mentality, trading in our druids staffs for spanners.<p>Aerodynamically, sails are simply vertical wings. Wind blowing across the vessel causes the sail to generate lift and drag, and the resultant vector has some forward component to pull the ship through the water. However, if the wind comes from an angle too close to the direction of travel, there is no thrust. As an added complication, the sail only sees the <i>relative</i> wind. If the ship travels faster, the wind will appear to come from closer and closer to the direction of travel, even if the true wind is coming from perpendicular to your course! Despite this, standard sails can still produce forward thrust as long as the wind is at least 20 degrees off from directly in front of the vessel. This is how our sails can still save power, even on a fast moving vessel.<p>There are many sail technologies out there. A common question we get asked is “Are you going to use flettner rotors/suction airfoils?”. Both of these technologies use power supplied by the ship to increase the lift produced by a surface; rotor-sails spin, and suction airfoils…suck? Each of these have a place, especially at low vessel speeds. But our customers ask us for a solution that works for container ships cruising at the relatively high speed of 22kt. At these speeds, the relative wind is almost always ahead of you, so lift/drag becomes more important. Powered sails suffer from poor lift/drag, both from the high induced drag from very high lift coefficients, and system losses from drawing on ship’s power. So no we are not going with flettner rotors/suction airfoils. While they are the new exciting technology on the block, if you factor in their power usage and high drag ratio, they are just not as practical as a simple sail.<p>So now that we’ve given a general summary of sailing, it’s time to explain how a 747 wing will ever fit inside a 9ft tall cargo container. It’s simple really: imagine a tape measure. In a tape measure a thin, flexible strip of metal is wound into a spiral. Then, when the metal is uncoiled, it naturally returns to its original shape.  That’s exactly how we plan to make our sails. The skin of our sail or the inner spars (we haven’t finalized our design) will be made of tape measure like material (2mm thick steel) and the wing will be able to extend out of the cargo container. The video in the first paragraph explains this in a bit more detail.<p>By fitting our sail into a cargo container we allow for our device to be installed on any cargo ship right at port.  Remember how we mentioned that some shippers are ordering a lot more ships and some ships are getting retrofitted with new fuel? Well, shipyards are backed up for the next 5 years. By making a device that requires no shipyard to install, not only will we drastically outcompete other retrofit WASP companies in terms of deployment cost, but we will be the only company with a product shippers can put on their ship without a multiple year wait time.<p>Do you have any interesting stories around sailing or wind tech? We would love to hear your ideas, experiences, and feedback on any and all of the above!</p>

## Ask HN: Best way to “donate” dev hours to charity?

<p>Hey,<p>I work at a service oriented dev company and from time to time we have some bench time to utilize. I'd like to keep people engaged on projects and ideally exposed them to best practices as much as possible.<p>What's the best way to find places to "donate" our time to certain charities or non-profit organizations?<p>Right now people are going out to our most used third party open source software repos and actively contributing there, but I'd like to do more of a full on apps.<p>Thanks</p>

## Ask HN: WWYD? Built a company valued at $1B and may walk away with nothing

<p>I'm looking for some "What Would You Do?" advice from the founder and investor community. Generally looking for guidance on what I should be negotiating for and what type of downside protection is fair, in any?<p>Financial Overview<p>- At our peak (Series C) we were valued at $1B post money - $187M raised by the company 
- $250M preference stack (liquidation prefs + debt)
- I own ~27% of the business, and so does my co-founder. My co-founder is no longer part of the business day-to-day, he's on the board
- We will end the year at $130M in annual revenues and burning ~$925K/month, we are a low gross profit margin business ~15-20%<p>Personal Overview 
- I live in New York City, it's been ~ 10 years that I have been on this journey, bootstrapped with no salary for about 2.5 years and pretty modest salary for most of the years, up until a couple years ago when I started getting "market rate"
- I have not taken any chips off the table via any secondary sale up to this point, never really got the chance 
- Today, my base salary is $175K, no bonus, no stock refresh since the founder grant, fully vested stock, no severance, no  indemnification. (Mainly because I just haven't asked for new comp b.c company is in a difficult spot)
- In comparison, I hired a critical new C-Suite exec (COO) and gave her $285K/year, 75-150% annual target bonus, $150K sign on bonus, $200K funding closed bonus, 1-year severance, and a 4% equity stake in the business
- I am starting to see some worrying signs of real burnout now (for myself)<p>State of the Union
- We have < 6 months of runway based on our current burn, but majority of the money left is debt now
- I am about to close on $30M of additional financing this month but the terms will decimate common stock holders (my 27% stake is likely going to go down to < 10%) 
- Still negotiating, but will likely have to give up board control so I could get fired immediately after financing is closed
- We are in parallel exploring strategic M&amp;A alternatives this year, but in the current market condition our business is likely worth less than the preference stack, in which case common stock is wiped out anyways and I get nothing.
- Lastly, I'm not confident on the current strategy to grow out of the current problem over the next couple years, so there's a lot of risk in our growth for 2024 and beyond. The strategy I would want to run as CEO is likely not something my COO or board will want to get behind and frankly I don't know if I have the energy to do it myself. It would require 24-36 months to transition the business to the new world while watching old revenue decline and waiting for new higher margin revenue build up in parallel to offset the declining revenues in the core business.<p>My #1 priority is to get the financing closed for the business. But from there, I'm really confused and don't know what to do next. Doesn't seem to make sense for me to work my ass off just to return money to investors and have nothing for myself. But I do understand that it is my fiduciary obligation as the Founder/CEO, but maybe for the first time in 10 years I'm asking the question "What's in it for me?"<p>WWYD?</p>
