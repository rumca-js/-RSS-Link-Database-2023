  <p id="EmpSKC">Late last week, Hulu started <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/03/31/hulu-tv-sidebar-update/">rolling out a redesign for its TV apps</a>, which changes how you navigate through the interface. The previous version (which some people still have) had the search, Home, TV, Movies, News, My Stuff, and Hubs buttons across the top of the screen. Now, those navigational buttons will live on the left.</p>
<p id="iaSc1W">Hulu’s top-bar design has always stood out from the crowd in a bad way. Even my wife, who isn’t that into tech and doesn’t generally comment on UIs, has complained about it. The problem with the old UI is that, in general, using a streaming app these days involves scrolling up and down through a massive list of content, realizing you don’t want to watch any of it, and then jumping to another section.</p>

## Google Flights’ price guarantee could pay you back if your tickets get cheaper

  <p id="vUuzhF">Google is testing out a price guarantee program for Google Flights that will pay you money if the price of a flight goes down after you booked it through the service. The feature is currently available as a “pilot program” in the US (get it?) for specific flights, <a href="https://blog.google/products/travel/flight-deals-hotel-browsing-google-search-features/">according to a Monday blog post</a>, but it could be a compelling reason to use Google’s tool the next time you’re searching for a flight.</p>
<p id="3vFaUW">When you’re using Google’s tool, some flights will have a little shield icon with a dollar sign. If you book that particular flight through Google Flights, the company says it’ll “monitor the price every day until departure.” If it drops, you’ll get the difference back. </p>

  <p id="ejDLkn">The US Department of Justice is suing Activision Blizzard because of claims the publisher <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-files-antitrust-lawsuit-against-activision-blizzard-2023-04-03/">instituted an anti-competitive soft salary cap for players</a> in its <em>Call of Duty</em> and <em>Overwatch</em> esports leagues. The publisher has <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-files-lawsuit-and-proposed-consent-decree-prohibit-activision-blizzard">agreed to settle the suit</a>.</p>
<p id="gntEGr"><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1577816/download">The complaint</a> details what the two leagues called a Competitive Balance Tax. Under the tax, if one of the franchised teams paid its players over a limit imposed by Activision Blizzard, the teams would be fined and have the fee distributed to the other non-offending teams. In theory, the Competitive Balance Tax was to prevent richer, better resourced teams from gobbling up the best talent with high salaries (i.e., what I’d call <a href="https://liquipedia.net/overwatch/Boston_Uprising">the “2023 Boston Uprising</a> rule”).

  <p id="6q97gG">Sony is introducing new tags in the PlayStation Store that provide an overview of accessibility features you can use in a game. The new “Accessibility Tags” will start to roll out globally this week in the store on PS5, Sony’s Hideaki Nishino says <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/04/03/accessibility-tags-roll-out-this-week-on-playstation-store-on-the-ps5-console/?sf265589114=1">in a post on the PlayStation blog</a>.</p>
<p id="082gGI">The tags will provide information on accessibility options for things like visual, audio, control, and gameplay features. They could be quite useful if you want to make sure a certain game is able to accommodate your specific needs.

  <p id="EsDp9I">Looks like it’s going to be another normal week on the bird site: people’s “Following” timelines are seemingly being flooded with unlabeled retweets from people they <em>don’t</em> follow, and a lot of people are seeing a Doge icon where the company’s bird logo used to be.</p>
<p id="1uLimz">Regarding the first one, no, your Following timeline isn’t suddenly being run by the algorithm behind the “For You” one. Twitter has simply stopped labeling retweets. Previously, when someone you followed retweeted something, the tweet would have a note above it saying who was responsible for it showing up on your timeline. Now, that label seems to have vanished on the web, so the tweets look exactly like the ones from the people you follow. </p>

  <p id="PKHIxV">Now that EA and FIFA have officially separated, we’re getting details about both of their soccer video game futures. EA has its upcoming simulation <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/10/23065405/ea-sports-fc-fifa-branding"><em>EA Sports FC</em></a>, while FIFA just launched a mobile game called <em>AI League</em>. It’s available now on Android in open beta (an iOS version is listed as “coming soon”).</p>
<p id="SSzIFb">Developed by game studio Altered State Machine, <em>AI League</em> is described as a “4-on-4 casual football game, played between AI-controlled characters, with player input at fun and tactical moments.

  <p id="E8PBby">The trailer for the <em>Blue Beetle</em> movie has apparently dropped sooner than DC had anticipated. The official <em>Blue Beetle</em> Twitter account teased that the first trailer for the movie would arrive sometime today, but it’s already circulating on social media. (The trailer is now live on all the official channels.)</p>
<p id="oLLEzd">The trailer features Xolo Maridueña as Jaime Reyes, an underemployed young man with a tight-knit family. One day, Jaime’s childhood friend Penny (Bruna Marquezine) entrusts him with a mysterious package that she begs Jaime not to open but also protect with his life. </p>
<p id="wvfPzu">Because this is a superhero movie, Jaime of course opens the package, discovering an alien artifact. The artifact, known as the Scarab, bonds to Jaime, covering him in...</p>

  <p id="DbAsL2">Google’s AirDrop competitor, Nearby Share, is now available on Windows as a beta app. After announcing plans for Nearby Share on Windows <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22864892/google-2022-ecosystem-android-chromebook-ces-features">at CES 2022</a>, Google has finally shipped the <a href="https://android.com/better-together/nearby-share-app/">Windows app as a beta</a> to allow Android users to share photos, documents, files, and links between Android devices and Windows PCs.</p>
<p id="3QXqlZ">The Windows Nearby Share just needs to be installed and configured to start sending and receiving files between Android and Windows devices. Google is supporting Windows 10 and up, but ARM-powered Windows laptops aren’t supported right now. You can setup Nearby Share to allow sharing with everyone, just your contacts, or limit it to your own devices.</p>

  <p id="4ZxB8j">The Tor Project, the organization behind <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/21/21138403/tor-privacy-tools-private-network-browser-settings-security">the anonymous network and browser,</a> is helping launch a privacy-focused browser that’s made to connect to a VPN instead of a decentralized onion network. It’s called the Mullvad browser, named after the Mullvad VPN company it’s partnered with on the project, and <a href="https://mullvad.net/browser">it’s available for Windows, Mac, or Linux.</a></p>
<p id="jN06PG">The Mullvad browser’s main goal is to make it harder for advertisers and other companies to track you across the internet. It does this by working to reduce your browser’s “fingerprint,” a term that describes all the metadata that sites can collect to uniquely identify your device. <a href="https://www.amiunique.org/fp">Your fingerprint</a> can be made up of simple things, like what browser and operating system you’re using, to more...</p>

## Twitter had a very messy weekend

  <p id="0ZtIN8">April 1st was the day Twitter said it would <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/23/23654206/twitter-legacy-blue-verified-checkmarks-april-fools-day">begin winding down its legacy verified program</a>. But like most things done at the company under Elon Musk’s leadership, the process appeared to be chaotically executed, and subject to the whims of its new CEO. </p>
<p id="q2bXBh">For starters, with the exception of one major corporate account, legacy verified checkmarks don’t appear to have actually started disappearing for any of the accounts we viewed. What <em>has</em> changed is that <a href="https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/twitter-updates-verified-user-descriptions-paid-blue-check-1235571165/">Twitter has stopped officially distinguishing</a> between legacy verified users and accounts that pay for Twitter Blue. Click on the verified blue badge for <a href="https://twitter.com/reckless"><em>Verge</em> Editor-in-chief Nilay Patel</a>, for example, and you’ll now see a message that reads “This account is verified because it’s subscribed...</p>

  <p id="xdeghK">Nick Fury’s kept himself pretty scarce since the events of <em>Spider-Man: Far From Home</em>, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp_YZNqNBhw">in the newest trailer</a> for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/31/23665128/marvel-secret-invasion-disney-plus-skrulls">Disney Plus’ upcoming <em>Secret Invasion </em>series</a>, the man behind the Avengers Initiative is back and preparing for a war that only he can wage.</p>
<p id="LCwiB2">Though much of <em>Secret Invasion</em>’s new trailer is footage we’ve seen before, a handful of new moments make clear that Nick Fury’s (Samuel L. Jackson) absence hasn’t gone unnoticed on Earth in the years since the Avengers managed to reverse Thanos’ snap. While Fury’s been off-planet hiding, Skrulls loyal to him back on Earth, like Talos (Ben Mendohlson), have watched as the extremist Gravik (Kingsley Ben-Adir) used Fury’s absence to justify their increasingly violent plays for true freedom...</p>
