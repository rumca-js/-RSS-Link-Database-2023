Recently, a city has become popular because it has been occupied by young people who want to "lie flat." It’s Dali, a historical and cultural city in Yunnan Province, southwest China, with a population of about 650,000. 
Now, we see the status quo of young people in China that some people aren’t even able to lie flat. It has outraged many young people. This song was published on Bilibili, a video-sharing website in China. The name is "Sunshine and Cheerful Kong Yiji". It was banned on the day it was published.
