<p>Antonio Conte branded Tottenham’s players selfish after they squandered a precious away lead in his final game in charge before the international break. The criticism may have stung Spurs but they did not learn their lesson. The 10 men of Everton salvaged a precious point in their bid to avoid the drop courtesy of Michael Keane’s stunning 90th minute equaliser.</p><p>A Harry Kane penalty, minutes after Abdoulaye Doucouré had invited a straight red card for foolishly raising his hand to the England captain’s face, looked to have given Cristian Stellini victory in his first outing as Spurs’ acting head coach following Conte’s dismissal. Lucas Moura then evened up the numbers by seeing red for a dreadful foul on Keane and, two minutes later, with Everton staring at a defeat that would have left them in the relegation zone, the recalled defender let fly with a 25-yard drive that flew beyond Hugo Lloris to rescue a merited point for Sean Dyche’s team.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/03/everton-tottenham-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sacking of two managers in months and bloated squad does not put Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali in a good light</p><p>Perhaps Graham Potter was on to something when he called it the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/11/graham-potter-claims-managing-chelsea-is-hardest-job-in-football">hardest job in football</a>. Everyone has seen Chelsea’s latest owners talk a good game, hire a slow-build coach, spend a fortune and try to stay calm during the tough times. The idea, to be different from Roman Abramovich, was noble. In reality, given everything that has happened since Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali assumed control last summer, it is hard not to wonder whether Abramovich has been questioning why exactly he is the one accused of presiding over a ruthless culture, not least because the record shows that even the most demanding of Russian oligarchs never got through two managerial sackings in a single campaign.</p><p>It is not a comparison that frames Boehly and Eghbali in a good light as they step up their search for Potter’s replacement and consider the virtues of Julian Nagelsmann, Mauricio Pochettino, Luis Enrique and Rúben Amorim. Already the great disruptors stand accused of achieving little more than repeatedly getting in their own way and, having burned through two managers in seven chaotic months, there is one big challenge facing Chelsea’s board: convincing their next hire that all those promises about building a collaborative culture really did count for something.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/03/chelsea-mess-is-a-reminder-that-spending-is-no-guarantee-of-success">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A 1998 TV movie about school segregation has led to a white mother worrying about her child feeling guilty about racism</p><p>Before the made-for-TV film Ruby Bridges made its ABC network premiere on the Sunday night of Martin Luther King weekend in 1998, a taped address from the White House set the tone.</p><p>Disney CEO Michael Eisner overviewed the 1954 supreme court decision that cleared a path for this six-year-old Black girl to begin integrating in New Orleans public schools in 1960, and nodded at the protests and violence Bridges and other school integration pioneers triggered nationwide. President Bill Clinton recalled his whitewashed Arkansas childhood, noting that he never went to school with a person of another race until attending college at Georgetown. “We’ve come a long way since 1954,” Clinton remarked, “but we still have a long way to go. Perhaps the greatest lesson we can learn from Ruby Bridges is that every one of us has the power to stand up against injustice and stand up to the ideals that make America great.” But in a sign of the times, that’s no longer the prevailing mood now.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/03/ruby-bridges-disney-movie-racism-culture-war-florida">Continue reading...</a>

<p>New podcast Stiffed investigates the forgotten story of Viva, a progressive magazine for women that featured Anna Wintour on staff</p><p>Back in the mid-aughts, right before the internet made Play-Doh spaghetti of the magazine industry, Jennifer Romolini was an editor at Lucky, a Conde Nast property dedicated to all things shopping. It was while researching her column on eBay and Etsy finds that she stumbled across something even better than a secondhand Laura Ashley frock: a back issue of a chic and not a little absurd erotic magazine geared for the thinking woman of the 1970s.</p><p>Viva had soft-focus photography by artists like Helmut Newton, and portfolios of male pubic topiaries styled by none other than future shampoo mogul Paul Mitchell. The articles bore the bylines of Patricia Bosworth, Betty Friedan, Nikki Giovanni and Anaïs Nin, and the fashion and beauty spreads were orchestrated by Anna Wintour. The British fashion editor had been fired from Harper’s Bazaar, and came to the crotch-centric magazine to resuscitate her career.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/03/stiffed-podcast-viva-magazine-erotic">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Child sexual abuse victims deserve more from ministers than divisive stereotypes and inflammatory language</p><p>Rishi Sunak’s announcement of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/apr/03/no-10-denies-using-dog-whistle-politics-in-grooming-gangs-crackdown-rishi-sunak" title="">crackdown on sexual exploitation by grooming gangs</a> appears to be the product of highly partisan political calculation, rather than the careful thought this problem deserves. He chose not to repeat, on Monday, the most inflammatory points made at the weekend by his home secretary, Suella Braverman. But by singling out the threat from gangs, as opposed to child sexual abuse in general, and by launching a new taskforce in Leeds – not far from where some notorious gangs operated – the government has committed to inflame the racial sensitivities surrounding this issue.</p><p>The taskforce was one of the commitments offered by Mr Sunak as part of his leadership bid. But as a crime-fighting tool, it looks weak. Specialist officers, with solid data to work with, are a good thing in any area of law enforcement. But the pledges being made to “stamp out” exploitation are unlikely to be kept. Police and courts are already overwhelmed with unmanageable workloads and staff shortages (including a lack of barristers), and struggling to cope with an explosion in online child sexual offences. The number of child sexual abuse cases resulting in a charge has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/apr/02/rishi-sunak-says-grooming-gang-crackdown-will-defy-political-correctness" title="">fallen to 11% from 32%</a> in seven years.

<p>Defeat for the social democrats and a charismatic leader is a result that reverberates beyond the country’s borders</p><p>For observers of a progressive persuasion, Sunday’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/02/sanna-marin-finland-election-sdp-social-democratic-national-coalition" title="">Finnish election</a> turned out to be an unwelcome repeat episode of Nordic noir. Last <a href="https://theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/sep/16/the-guardian-view-on-swedens-election-enter-the-radical-right" title="">autumn</a>, Sweden ejected a Social Democrat prime minister and installed a moderate Conservative successor, while at the same time empowering the radical right Sweden Democrats party. The same playbook may now be followed in Helsinki, after a cliffhanger vote <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/03/finland-shifts-to-the-right-coalition-talks-petteri-orpo-ncp-sanna-marin-election" title="">delivered</a> a similar electoral outcome.</p><p>The high-profile casualty of this rightwards shift was Finland’s millennial prime minister, Sanna Marin, who has been ousted four years after becoming the world’s youngest political leader. Though Ms Marin’s Social Democratic party actually improved its vote share, it narrowly came in third behind moderate conservatives and the radical right in what was a photo-finish. Her coalition government’s fate was sealed by a collapse in support for allied leftwing parties, as the centre-right successfully mobilised fears over state borrowing levels.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/03/the-guardian-view-on-finlands-election-another-episode-of-nordic-noir">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Readers express their hopes, and fears, about recent developments in artificial intelligence chatbots</p><p>Evgeny Morozov’s piece is correct insofar as it states that AI is a long way from the general sentient intelligence of human beings (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/30/artificial-intelligence-chatgpt-human-mind" title="">The problem with artificial intelligence? It’s neither artificial nor intelligent, 30 March</a>). But that rather misses the point of the thinking behind the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/29/elon-musk-joins-call-for-pause-in-creation-of-giant-ai-digital-minds" title="">open letter</a> of which I and many others are signatories. ChatGPT is only the second AI chatbot to pass the Turing test, which was proposed by the mathematician Alan Turing in 1950 to test the ability of an AI model to convincingly mimic a conversation well enough to be judged human by the other participant. To that extent, current chatbots represent a significant milestone.</p><p>The issue, as Evgeny points out, is that a chatbot’s abilities are based on a probabilistic prediction model and vast sets of training data fed to the model by humans. To that extent, the output of the model can be guided by its human creators to meet whatever ends they desire, with the danger being that its omnipresence (via search engines) and its human-like abilities have the power to create a convincing reality and trust where none does and should exist. As with other significant technologies that have had an impact on human civilisation, their development and deployment often proceeds at a rate far faster than our ability to understand all their effects – leading to sometimes undesirable and unintended consequences.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/03/the-danger-of-blindly-embracing-the-rise-of-ai">Continue reading...</a>

## Delaying NatWest share sales doesn’t matter. Just get the best price | Nils Pratley

<p>A formal date can concentrate minds, yet the priority must be the achievement of value for the public purse</p><p>It was almost exactly a year ago that the Treasury trumpeted what it called a “landmark” moment: for the first time since the financial crisis in 2008, NatWest, the formerly shredded Royal Bank of Scotland, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/landmark-12-billion-share-sale-sees-government-stake-in-natwest-group-reduced-to-below-50-for-first-time-since-financial-crisis">was no longer majority-owned by the state</a>. A £1.2bn sale of shares had cut the Treasury’s holding to 48.1%.</p><p>A path to a full disposal by 2025-26 – a target the government set itself in 2021 – seemed assured, especially as UK Government Investments (UKGI), which manages the holding, cracked on with the selling and got the stake down to 41.5% in short order. Pandemic fears over losses had passed. It was possible to believe in a happy tale of more shares being sold at gradually higher prices against a backdrop of robust market demand.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/apr/03/delaying-natwest-share-sales-doesnt-matter-just-get-the-best-price">Continue reading...</a>

Parts of the national park are worryingly overgrazed, particularly by sheep, say nature experts, which is destroying habitats and putting rare birds at risk of local extinction. Breeding populations of moorland birds such as golden plover, red grouse and ring ouzels have now gone or are on the verge of being lost.</p><p>Natural England, the government nature watchdog, has advised farmers who are in agri-environment schemes and receive government money for nature friendly farming that they will have to reduce their stocks.

<p>Cashing in on club’s most valuable assets to meet financial fair play regulations meant downturn in fortunes was inevitable</p><p>For Brendan Rodgers, it had been business as usual on Sunday. The Leicester manager called his players into the club’s Seagrave training ground to analyse the bitterly disappointing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/01/crystal-palace-leicester-premier-league-match-report">last-minute defeat at Crystal Palace</a> that left them in the bottom three and he was fully expecting to take charge of the meeting with Aston Villa on Tuesday until the bad news was delivered by the chairman, Aiyawatt “Top” Srivaddhanaprabha.</p><p>But if the timing of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/02/brendan-rodgers-leaves-leicester-by-mutual-consent-after-palace-defeat">Rodgers’s departure</a> four years after he succeeded Claude Puel came as something of a surprise, even he must have expected it would eventually end like this given the way things have unravelled since the start of the season. One win and seven defeats from the opening 10 Premier League games after a summer of only two signings – the defender Wout Faes for £17m on deadline day, to replace the £75m Chelsea-bound Wesley Fofana, and the third-choice goalkeeper, Alex Smithies – were followed by signs before the World Cup that Leicester might have turned a corner. But their regression since has culminated in six defeats and no wins in their past seven matches and forced Srivaddhanaprabha’s hand.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/03/brendan-rodgers-paid-the-price-for-leicesters-drive-to-balance-the-books">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Semi-automatic rifles such as the AR-15 have become the weapon of choice for mass shooters. They’ve been banned before – yet countless gun owners are determined it will never happen again</p><p>Hogs are a big problem on Brandon Brown’s ranchland in the Texas panhandle. They tear up the ground, travel in droves and are a general nuisance, as they are in many other parts of the southern US. For some, hunting them is a combination of pastime and pest control.</p><p>So when Brown wanted to find a rifle that was accurate, lightweight and fired bullets big enough to take out a feral pig, he chose the most popular rifle in the US: the AR-15. “It’s a great hunting gun. It’s great,” Brown says. “The AR overall is pretty much indestructible.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/03/its-a-weapon-to-hunt-people-why-so-many-americans-hate-and-love-the-ar-15">Continue reading...</a>

Yet it remains the case that when politicians deny the problems that are staring everyone in the face, or admit the problem but deny the cause, then turn round and argue that no, actually, you caused it, or remainers caused it, or Albanians caused it, or the wokerati caused it, that is quite unsettling. You could call it gaslighting, or you could call it nascent totalitarianism, and I am happy with either because I don’t work for the BBC.</p><p>If you cling on to your observable realities, you fall out of step with the norm. To join the herd, you have to deny your own experience. It’s amazing how many people are prepared to ventriloquise plainly ridiculous propositions, such as: “It’s not Brexit causing this or that crisis – it’s small boats”, on to other, nameless opinion-formers – “That’s what they think in Lincolnshire, anyway” – just to avoid the discomfort of the fringes.</p><p>Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/03/the-dover-jam-is-not-a-great-british-queue-it-is-a-brexit-sponsored-circle-of-hell">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>The Hepworth Wakefield<br /></strong>From flattened coffee pots to a steel wedding dress, embroidery to a rotting dessert trolley, a kaleidoscopic range of work by women sculptors is part of a vital generational study<strong><br /></strong></p><p>On the morning I hurry to If Not Now, When? at The Hepworth Wakefield, with its urgent request for my attention, I get the sense that time is rushing by as I recall the first time I visited the gallery over 10 years ago. Time is also a preoccupation for the artists who participated in two surveys – led by Lorna Green in 1988 and Griselda Pollock (alongside Green) in 2022 – into the practices, challenges and approaches of women working in sculpture. In their responses, they think about how seasons of caregiving can pause and propel, how the restrictions of gender can cause them to fall out of step with the contemporary art world and how time itself can interact with materials and making.</p><p>Work by a select number of the artists that contributed to either survey appears in If Not Now, When? and offers a snapshot into the changing concerns of people with lived experiences as women (including transgender and non-binary people) over the past 30 years. Split into three time-related categories – In Women’s Time, Tumbling Through Time and The Time Is Now – the exhibition is a cacophony of textures, forms and figures. At first glance, the works seem disparate; <a href="https://www.katrinacowling.co.uk/">Katrina Cowling</a>’s curves of glowing neon glass compete with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/may/22/cornelia-parker-tate-britain-london-review">Cornelia Parker</a>’s floating steel coffee pots; <a href="https://pamelastorey.art/about">Pamela Storey</a>’s tiny wire figure balances high above heads while <a href="https://www.permindarkaur.com/">Permindar Kaur</a>’s pierced dolls line up across the wall and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/mar/13/going-big-uncontainable-brilliance-of-sculptor-phyllida-barlow">Phyllida Barlow</a>’s heap of bubbling black bitumen and rubber contrasts with <a href="https://artuk.org/discover/artists/williams-lois-b-1953">Lois Williams</a>’ soft, furry forms.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/03/if-not-now-when-review-wakefield-post-hepworth-survey-female-narrative-sculpture">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A meteor shower is the central mystery of a documentary set in the Moroccan desert that feels like a cinematic sleeping pill</p><p>Here is an arthouse documentary from Morocco that moves at geological speed, demanding every single last shred of your attention. It’s a cinematic essay about the origins of human life, but for me many of the scenes felt too opaque and ponderous to really dig into the ideas.</p><p>It begins in the bleak emptiness of the Moroccan desert, where a nomad shepherd called Mohamed describes watching a meteor shower: blue fire lighting up the sky followed by a noise so loud people thought it was an earthquake; the ground beneath him trembled. Mohamed lives in a tent with his family, but his way of life is disappearing. The land is so dry (presumably as a result of climate change) that there is not enough grass for sheep to graze. So Mohamed joins men looking for the debris from the meteorite shower. Director Adnane Baraka uses a contrived technique of having Mohamed and his family speak their innermost thoughts and feelings to each other in a whispery voiceover, like a Terrence Malick movie.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/03/fragments-from-heaven-review-adnane-baraka">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ditch the processed food and try these broad bean burgers and green mac’n’cheese </p><p>In 1950, less than 1% of the UK population was clinically obese; today, that figure stands at 28%. This is not because we have suffered a massive collapse of willpower, but because we live in a different food environment from our predecessors. Modern industrial production methods have created an abundance of cheap, unhealthy food of a kind that we are biologically programmed to crave. Because junk food is easy to sell, companies spend huge amounts developing and marketing it. We eat more of it, the market expands, manufacturers spend more on it, we eat more … and so on. We have become trapped in a junk food cycle.</p><p>In my new book, Ravenous, I am on a mission: to help anyone with a stake in the food system (which is every single one of us) understand how it actually works, why it is making us sick and destroying our environment, and what we can do to change it. Over the next few weeks, I’ll be sharing family friendly recipes that link to the key themes of the book, starting with breaking this cycle. My healthy versions of junk-food classics have been tested extensively on children: first, on my three kids; and then on thousands of children whose lunches have been transformed by the charity <a href="https://chefsinschools.org.uk/">Chefs in Schools</a>. They are also cheap and easy to make.</p><p>Ravenous: How To Get Ourselves and Our Planet Into Shape, by Henry Dimbleby with Jemima Lewis, is published by Profile books at £16.99.

<p>Recent breakthroughs have been wildly hyped – but there’s still reason to hope</p><p>One look at your energy bills this winter might have convinced you that the 1950s idea that electricity would, in the near future, become “<a href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/students/history-101/too-cheap-to-meter.html" title="">too cheap to meter</a>” was not so much a false promise as a sick joke. That over-excited claim was prompted by hopes that nuclear fusion – the process triggered in an uncontrolled manner in hydrogen bombs – would soon be harnessed for power generation. In the type of nuclear power we have today, disintegration of radioactive atoms such as uranium produces heat but also a troublesome legacy of radioactive waste that will stay active for millennia. Fusion power plants would instead generate energy using the same process that powers the sun: fusing of the dense nuclei of hydrogen atoms, releasing some of the formidable energy held in the atomic nucleus, with only helium as the byproduct, and without the pollution.</p><p>Today the allure of fusion energy lies not so much in its price as its almost negligible carbon emissions, and therefore its potential to save us from the ravages of global heating. But will it arrive in time to stop the planet frying?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/03/the-big-idea-will-fusion-power-save-us-from-the-climate-crisis">Continue reading...</a>

<p>These two men find themselves in the clutches of the very systems of justice that they believed they could flaunt with impunity</p><p>Let’s not ignore the poetic justice: on 17 March, the international criminal court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin; a scant two weeks later, a grand jury in New York voted to indict Donald Trump. Admittedly, the two cases are quite different. Putin is wanted for his role in orchestrating devastating war crimes. Trump stands accused of relatively minor crimes involving the payment of hush money to a former porn star. But there is a sense that these two men, so recently bound in mutual admiration of their bullying contempt for democratic norms and legal process, now find themselves in the clutches of the very systems of justice that they believed they could flaunt with impunity.</p><p>Of course, there is no guarantee that either man will ever be held fully held to account. Those looking forward to the day of Putin’s reckoning before the ICC in The Hague should bear in mind that the only reason the allies succeeded in trying members of the Nazi leadership in Nuremberg was because Hitler’s Germany lay in ruins. Putin remains very much in power and presides over an arsenal of 6,000 nuclear warheads that he continues to recklessly brandish. Unless Putin finds himself ousted from power, his arrest warrant will remain a symbolic reminder that in the eyes of international law, the Russian leader is a pariah and a fugitive.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/03/long-arm-of-the-law-trump-putin-lawrence-douglas">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘We never wanted to become a Factory tribute band’: A Certain Ratio on mortality, Manchester – and Madonna

<p>The massively influential band have been plying their blend of jazz, funk, post-punk and pop for 45 years. But as they release new album, the founding members are in no mood for nostalgia</p><p>When A Certain Ratio performed at New York’s Danceteria in 1982, the gig would be remembered by the Manchester band for a showdown with their up-and-coming support act. “I had a massive argument with Madonna,” says drummer Donald Johnson. Although it was one of her first performances, the 24-year-old singer insisted that the headliner clear the stage of instruments before she played. “I love that she stood her ground,” Johnson adds. “She knew what she wanted.”</p><p>For ACR, it was just another bracing experience during a formative stint in NYC where they witnessed early hip-hop shows, sweated by night at Studio 54 and slept by day on the floor of an apartment with Robert DeNiro as its upstairs neighbour. Their new album, 1982, isn’t so much nostalgic for that year as a way of communing with the eclectic, up-for-grabs spirit of the time: one the Manchester institution has drawn on to overcome a period of loss and personal reflection, as they discuss over video call.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/03/we-never-wanted-to-become-a-factory-tribute-band-a-certain-ratio-on-mortality-manchester-and-madonna">Continue reading...</a>

In July, she stumbled upon a record by the band Society System Decontrol, whom she had never come across before. “I listened to it and straight away I loved it. There was a note inside saying: ‘SS Decontrol would like to play your city or town,’ with a phone number.”</p><p>Deciding she would like to book them for an event, Nancy called the number. She reached Al, the band’s guitar player, who lived just outside Boston. “I was working as a machinist, making parts for jet engines, and playing in the band,” he says. “We couldn’t play the dates Nancy asked for, but we ended up talking for three hours. I knew it was pretty special to keep chatting for that long.” He asked if she would like to come and see the band play live the week after in Staten Island, New York, and told her he would put her name on the guest list.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/03/how-we-met-he-asked-if-i-was-a-smoker-i-said-not-any-more-and-tossed-the-cigarette-away">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Of the many Italian recipes for goat, this stew is perhaps the most Roman in approach, braised with chillies, wine, and waxy potatoes</p><p>Tracking ingredients through <a href="https://www.newtoncompton.com/area/cucina">the Newton &amp; Compton regional recipe series</a> makes me feel like <a href="https://www.juliadonaldson.co.uk/books/picture-books/the-detective-dog/">Julia Donaldson’s detective dog Nell</a>. Although, rather than investigating who stole the library books, the scent is cooking patterns and the differences between the 20 regions of Italy. The word this week was <em>capra</em> (goat).</p><p>All 20 regions have recipes. Abruzzo is the most generous, providing seven in total. Three braises – with herbs, tomatoes and sweet-and-sour onions – two roasts, and two <em>brodettati;</em> that is, braised and then given a silky finish with egg yolks and lemon. Among Sicily’s six recipes, there is one for young goat cooked with tomato, potatoes and olives, and finished with cheese; another for a stew with ground and sliced almonds. The Sardinian edition also has six recipes. One for goat roasted with a breadcrumb and herb crust, another (for large festive occasions) that involves digging a hole, lining it with branches of myrtle and rosemary, and baking a goat whole.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/apr/03/roman-braised-goat-recipe-rosemary-and-potatoes-rachel-roddy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Thomas Müller was instrumental as Bayern began the Tuchel era with a familiar swatting aside of supposed title rivals</p><p>Bayern Munich couldn’t have hoped for a more emphatic return to form on Saturday. The Bavarian giants welcomed apparent title rivals Borussia Dortmund to the Allianz Arena, and quickly reverted back to their traditional role as Bundesliga champions-elect– perennial architects of doom for any domestic rival that dare question their authority.</p><p>It was fitting their new head coach, Thomas Tuchel, enjoyed a perfect start to life in Munich through the clinical finishing of Thomas Müller, whose back-post finish and instinctual rebound bagged the second and third goals on the night, following an opening howler from the Dortmund keeper, Gregor Kobel. Not only had Müller been marginalised by Tuchel’s predecessor, Julian Nagelsmann, but he was also one of a handful of senior figures within the Bayern squad who remained unconvinced by the young tactician. That lingering apathy turned sour and led to the German giants cutting their losses and opting for Tuchel in rather dramatic fashion.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/03/bundesliga-bayern-dortmund-muller-tuchel-kobel-reus-blog">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Manchester United still have a soft centre, Leandro Trossard is proving a smart signing and Liverpool face a crucial week</p><p>For all the improvements Erik ten Hag brings to Manchester United, there remains a soft centre. Their record away from home against top 10 opposition could prove costly in the race for the Champions League. Though Newcastle United did not blow Ten Hag’s team away like Liverpool did last month, they were deserved, easy victors. Ten Hag might look to the steel in midfield that was the core of Newcastle’s win, with Bruno Guimarães outstanding and Sean Longstaff supplying artisanship and exertion alongside him. It was not a gala Sunday afternoon for the Bruno Fernandes fan club, and Casemiro was again glaringly missed, even if he was among the guilty at Anfield. Ten Hag’s late readjustment of his team, removing centre-backs to go for broke, backfired as Callum Wilson scored soon after. It is difficult to imagine Howe taking such high-risk gambles. His reward was revenge for Wembley and a tighter command of that top-four objective. <strong>John Brewin</strong></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/02/newcastle-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report">Newcastle 2-0 Manchester United</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/01/arsenal-leeds-premier-league-match-report">Arsenal 4-1 Leeds</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/01/chelsea-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report">Chelsea 0-2 Aston Villa</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/01/manchester-city-liverpool-premier-league-match-report">Manchester City 4-1 Liverpool</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/01/nottingham-forest-wolves-premier-league-match-report">Nottingham Forest 1-1 Wolves</a></em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/03/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I have relocated to the Big Apple and am loving its epic skyline and endless bustle. No wonder Lois Dodd, Jane Freilicher and Alice Neel enjoyed painting the thrilling views from their apartments</p><p>New York is a city full of windows, looking out and looking in. A shifting play of rectangles, the city is made up of boxes upon boxes. People live in them, breathe in them, glide up them, sleep in them. Artists, too, make their work in them, and painters confine what they see within the four corners of their frames. You can understand why artists worked with geometric abstractions here: it’s in the multilayered landscapes that morph in and out of infinite squares and strokes.</p><p>Last week I relocated to New York for a few months. I’ve always loved this city, but I’ve never stayed longer than two weeks. I’m based just above the East Village, and already when I wake up I’m enmeshed in the noises outside. Although I’m on my own, there’s a comforting feeling that I have everyone around me, wrapped up in our boxes, about to embark on the day ahead.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/03/high-rise-heaven-new-york-big-apple-lois-dodd-alice-neel-windows">Continue reading...</a>

But that’s fine, she doesn’t have to – she lived it.</p><p>The adamantly uncompromising film-maker behind First Cow and Certain Women got her start when independence was still a viable way of life for a generation of artists, young people who aspired to the modest goal of a minimally demeaning job to keep the bills paid and the space to make their thing their way. The media branded this demographic “slackers”, but their seeming lack of ambition belied a strongly held set of principles about the freedom to work unencumbered by commercial imperatives. Reichardt was there, she still recognizes the preciousness of this low-stakes creative latitude, and these days, she’s understandably uneasy about how difficult attaining it can be.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/apr/03/kelly-reichardt-director-interview-showing-up-michelle-williams">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Film-maker Lucas Vernier retraces his grandfather’s footsteps as a member of the French army in a powerful portrait of a country at war</p><p>Film-maker Lucas Vernier’s grandfather was a member of the <em>méhariste</em> – the camel cavalry – during the French mandate in Syria, and Vernier traces his footsteps by embarking on his own journey to the Badia desert in 2009. Determined to revisit the places captured in his grandfather’s sprawling archive, Vernier’s documentary lends a tangible vitality to his family history. Once frozen in the frames of black-and-white photos, the Syrian soldiers who served in the camel corps live on in the memories of their descendants; their recollections evoke the open-hearted spirit of the film’s title, a traditional greeting in Arabic.</p><p>Providing a visual link between the past and the present, Vernier’s 2009 trip unfolds like a photographic scavenger hunt. Once the figures in his grandfather’s pictures are identified, Vernier reconstructs these compositions by directing his interview subjects to adopt the same pose as their ancestors. The process no doubt serves as a gesture of tribute, but also suggests a lack of introspection on Vernier’s part. Though politically progressive, his grandfather was also an instrument of French imperialism in the Middle East, a complex position which the film barely interrogates. Vernier’s compulsion to reproduce these images neglects to consider the colonialist context in which they were created.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/03/ahlan-wa-sahlan-review-journey-into-syrias-colonial-past-with-the-camel-cavalry">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A young delinquent takes stock of his bad luck and bad decisions in this brief but brilliant novel from the author of Grief Is the Thing With Feathers</p><p>Stylistically unorthodox, a little mystical, with a big heart and a small page count, the novels of Max Porter (the prize-winning author of <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/11/grief-is-the-thing-with-feathers-max-porter-paperback-of-the-week#:~:text=This%20tiny%20exchange%20sums%20up,as%20its%20power%20to%20move.">Grief Is the Thing </a></em><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/11/grief-is-the-thing-with-feathers-max-porter-paperback-of-the-week#:~:text=This%20tiny%20exchange%20sums%20up,as%20its%20power%20to%20move.">With Feathers</a></em>) are one of the surprise success stories of modern literary publishing. True, even his most ardent fans may have balked at the nigh-on impenetrable experiment of his last book, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/dec/29/the-death-of-francis-bacon-by-max-porter-review-last-rites-for-a-great-artist">The Death of Francis Bacon</a></em>, but admirers of 2019’s <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/05/lanny-max-porter-review">Lanny</a></em>, Porter’s fabulist state-of-England satire about a precocious boy of the same name, are on safer ground with his new novel, <em>Shy</em>, about another eponymous boy who might be Lanny’s unluckier cousin.<br /><br />Shy, 15, lives at Last Chance, a rural institution for delinquent boys in the West Country, after being expelled from school (twice), cautioned at 13 and recently arrested. He has, among other things, “sprayed, snorted, smoked, sworn, stolen, cut, punched, run, jumped, crashed an Escort, smashed up a shop, trashed a house, broken a nose, stabbed his stepdad’s finger”. We join him when he’s creeping out of Last Chance in the small hours, heading to a pond with a rucksack full of drum’n’bass tapes and, more ominously, rocks.<br /><br />What follows, over 128 pages, is his jumble of night thoughts as Shy looks back on the turning points that brought him to where he is, as well as his interactions with staff and other boys at Last Chance. The narration unfolds as a kind of spectral swirl of voices in which assorted weights and sizes of type indicate different timelines. Vivid scenes erupt like lightning in fog, from Shy’s childhood anger at learning that Santa is actually his stepdad, to his slicing open another boy’s head with broken glass during a town-centre fracas in his teens.</p><p>We’re in 1995, the dog days of Tory rule under John Major, whose words – “Society needs to condemn a little more and understand a little less” – Porter might have had pinned above his laptop to kick against. The result is exhilarating. One paragraph runs three-and-a-half pages without full stops to hustle us through the pile-up of bad luck and bad decisions that lead Shy to trash his school chemistry lab, having failed to lose his virginity after “fiddling around trying to get the smelly, greasy-thick condom on, useless knob like a dumpling”.<br /><br />Part of Porter’s point is that there’s more going on inside his protagonist than anyone sees. Listening to his jungle tapes, Shy hears the beat “crisp and juicy, mathematical perfection, up, up and away... Obviously he never says any of this... he just says Hardcore. Nice. Yeah.” But while the novel keeps in view the difficulty for those on the sharp end of Shy’s recklessness (his stepdad asks “when will the Jekyll and Hyde shit end”), there’s an unhelpful tendency to portray him as an ambassador for a superior moral universe. When a staff member asks what Shy worries about, he says the rainforests “and people slagging off Sting for giving a fuck... It winds me up.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/03/shy-by-max-porter-review-exhilarating-portrait-of-a-lost-boy-in-90s-britain-grief-is-the-thing-with-feathers">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The centenary of the Flying Scotsman offers an opportunity to rediscover the anti-car icons of yesteryear </p><p>This year marks the centenary of Britain’s top mechanical celebrity: the Flying Scotsman locomotive. It emerged from the Doncaster works of the London &amp; North Eastern Railway (LNER) in 1923 and is celebrating its anniversary with an <a href="https://www.railwaymuseum.org.uk/whats-on/flying-scotsman-centenary-celebration">exhibition at the National Railway Museum</a> in York, special excursions and visits to heritage railways around the country.</p><p>Scotsman is often described as an icon, but what exactly does it represent? I would say early British PR. There were Flying Scotsman ashtrays, jigsaws and paperweights – and the loco often hauled the train of nearly the same name, the Flying Scotsman (train names being preceded by the definite article), which was glamourised by the LNER, with its onboard barber, cinema carriage and Louis XIV-style restaurant car. But why all the glitz?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/apr/03/travel-back-in-time-six-of-britains-best-heritage-railways">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A search for traces of the histories of Black culture and slavery on the streets of Manchester</p><p>Wandering around Manchester, I thought of how, on the surface, little about the city speaks with much eloquence of its history connected to the enslavement of Black people, or even its more empowering cultural moments, such as the clubs and shebeens in Moss Side that acted as safe spaces for the Black community in the 70s and 80s. How do you photograph something that is no longer there? The spirit of a dead building, the ghosts of an empire, the soul of a displaced community? This was the question I grappled with as I went out in the rain with my camera and some expired film. In the end, the best I came up with was to try to photograph the city in a way that made everything slightly off-kilter and uncanny, with the strange colour washes of old chemicals, that seems to hint at a haunting.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2023/apr/03/cottontown">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Wigmore Hall, London</strong><br />However much the sonatas may sprawl, Osborne showed that both works contain passages of power and intensity</p><p>The Wigmore Hall could have taken an easy way out with the 150th birthday of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/sergei-rachmaninov">Sergei Rachmaninov</a>, perhaps by marking the event with a programme of his popular piano pieces and songs. Instead it opted for what are perhaps his biggest and most challenging solo-piano works, the two sonatas, and invited <a href="https://www.stevenosborne.com/">Steven Osborne</a> to play them on the exact anniversary.</p><p>Rachmaninov himself had misgivings about both the sonatas, never including the first (which he completed in 1906, between the second and third piano concertos) in his recitals after he left Russia in 1917, and subsequently revising and substantially cutting the second, originally composed in 1913. But, as Osborne’s performances so magnificently demonstrated, however much the structures may sprawl or the textures become congested, especially in the first sonata, both works contain passages of unmistakable power and intensity.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/03/steven-osborne-review-sonatas-to-celebrate-the-150th-birthday-of-sergei-rachmaninov">Continue reading...</a>

It reminded me of something the composer of the Succession theme said: “How can I make this feel as if something’s wrong?”</p><p>That was exactly the sound he was going for, he told me the next day in the Café Royal, possibly the plushest hotel suite I’ve ever laid eyes on, let alone been allowed inside. “I said to [composer and arranger] Nicholas Jacobson-Larson, I need you to build an earthquake.

Anyone susceptible to being triggered by sexual abuse, violence and child cruelty should give the subject the widest of berths. But after two seasons of unflinchingly charting allegations of decades of horrific abuse enacted by R Kelly, the tone of Netflix’s third season is markedly different from what came before: it is joyful, at times bordering on giddy.

This is no longer just about survival – it’s a victory lap.</p><p>The programme does not understate its impact and begins with a montage of politicians and celebrities referencing it. At its most deliciously smug moment, it even shows footage of Kelly and his lawyers freaking out about the documentary, calling the creators and subject liars and fruitlessly mocking their campaign. Oronike Odeleye, co-founder of Mute R Kelly, grins from ear to ear as she talks about being sent the footage by those who thought it was “outrageous”, but she would respond: “No, it’s wonderful. This is beautiful. He knows who we are.

<p>The tennis titan with a howitzer serve thought invincibility on the court meant impunity off it. Oscar-winner Alex Gibney reveals how he charted the star’s path from fortunes and trophies to squatters and prison</p><p>Boris Becker was the poster-boy of 1980s tennis, the 17-year-old upstart who turned Wimbledon on its head. He possessed a howitzer serve, a gambler’s swagger and a habit – at once exhilarating and alarming – of diving full-length in pursuit of seemingly irretrievable balls. No match was complete without the sight of Becker crashing to the ground like a cold-cocked prizefighter. Most times, he bounced straight back to his feet.</p><p>In 2018, the Oscar-winning film-maker Alex Gibney – a keen player himself – began preparing a documentary on Becker’s colourful life and times. He envisaged the film as a celebration, a rollicking portrait of a sporting giant. But events intruded, the law intervened and his picture took a more dramatic route. “You never know what you’re going to find when you start to make a film,” Gibney says. “With a documentary, you write the script at the end not the beginning, based on what you discover along the way.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/03/boris-becker-alex-gibney-oscar-boom-boom">Continue reading...</a>

The Manchester Guardian was founded in 1821, at a time when one industry dominated Manchester <strong>– </strong>cotton. Maya talks to <strong>Dr Matthew Stallard</strong> about why Manchester was known as ‘Cottonopolis’ and where its cotton was coming from. She also talks to <strong>Prof David Olusoga</strong> about the illusion at the centre of British history that conceals the role of slavery in building the nation, and to the teacher and researcher <strong>Washington Alcott</strong> about the difficulties he faced when trying to document Manchester’s links to the transatlantic slave trade. <strong>Prof Gurminder Bhambra </strong>believes that to understand the full implications of transatlantic slavery we need to see its place in a wider picture of the British empire.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/apr/03/cotton-capital-the-bee-and-the-ship-examining-the-guardians-links-to-slavery-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
