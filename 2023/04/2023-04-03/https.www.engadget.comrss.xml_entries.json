As ASUS' early marketing suggests, though, there are potentially strong advantages. Unlike the Steam Deck, which is officially limited to running games in your Steam library (and only some, at that), the Ally can theoretically run most any game its hardware can handle. And while brands like Ayaneo and GPD are relatively small, ASUS is a major name \u2014 you'll likely have an easier time finding the Ally.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/asus-rog-ally-is-yet-another-steam-deck-competitor-204535105.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/asus-rog-ally-is-yet-another-steam-deck-competitor-204535105.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-03 20:45:35+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Activision Blizzard settles DOJ lawsuit over eSports wage suppression", "description": "<p>The US Department of Justice has settled a lawsuit it <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-files-lawsuit-and-proposed-consent-decree-prohibit-activision-blizzard\">filed Monday</a> with Activision Blizzard over suppressed eSports wages, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-files-antitrust-lawsuit-against-activision-blizzard-2023-04-03/\">according to</a><em>Reuters</em>.

As Reddit user ra13 <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/123fjx8/google_has_applied_a_5_million_items_limit_for/\">discovered</a>, personal (Google One) and business (Google Workspace) users get an error message if they try to directly upload any files past that ceiling. The cap doesn't apply to shared files, which are already limited to 400,000 items.</p><p>In a statement, Google says the file cap is meant to prevent abuses that might hurt the &quot;stability and safety&quot; of Drive. This isn't a limit on the total number of files in a drive. The number of affected users is &quot;vanishingly small,&quot; the company adds.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The main problem, as you might imagine, is that there's a chance you'll reach the file limit before you run out of the storage you've paid for. Ra13 estimated that a user with a 2TB Google One account may face that dilemma if the average file size is 400KB or less. While Google is right that won't likely be an issue for most people, it could be problematic for fans of cloud backups or pros whose apps produce a flood of small files.</p><p>Moreover, Google hasn't publicly acknowledged the cap until now. The company's product and support pages don't mention the file creation limit. There's also no counter, so you don't know exactly how many files you'll need to delete or compress to make room for more. The lack of transparency has left some users  racing to either trim their Drive libraries or find alternatives without similar restrictions.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-drive-now-caps-the-number-of-files-you-can-create-191230988.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/google-drive-now-caps-the-number-of-files-you-can-create-191230988.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-03 19:12:30+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Yale's Assure Lock 2 is down to its lowest price ever", "description": "<p>The <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ZYWxlLUFzc3VyZS1LZXktRnJlZS1Ub3VjaHNjcmVlbi1XaS1GaS9kcC9CMEI5SFkzNjE0P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXI2LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1M2JiM2Y4Mi1iMTQ0LTQyYmItOThhMi01MTZiZmNlZWE2ZDIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVqkpmgl9cInzteGv0MrKEOLmZmPzq44vpRTEPqthgHz&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FYale-Assure-Key-Free-Touchscreen-Wi-Fi%2Fdp%2FB0B9HY3614\">Yale Assure Lock 2</a> can automatically open your door, takes voice commands and let guests in with a code.

In most cases, it only requires a Phillips head screwdriver to install and it took our reviewer about a half hour, and that included some minor troubleshooting with customer service.

The lock also works with voice controls using any smart home assistant, but requires a spoken pin for added security. Exposing any system to remote access capabilities can leave room for exploitation, so Yale includes two-layer encryption, two-factor authentication and biometric verification to make things more secure.&nbsp;</p><p>One drawback is that the lock uses disposable AA batteries. Due to fire safety regulations, there's no option for a rechargeable battery pack. If the batteries happen to die when you're out an about, you can hold a 9-volt battery up to the bottom of the lock to give it enough juice to let you in so you can swap out the cells.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter and </em><a href=\"https://subscription.yahoo.net/Newsletter/Preference/sub?b=engadgetdeals&amp;src\"><em>subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter</em></a><em> for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/yales-assure-lock-2-is-down-to-its-lowest-price-ever-182029122.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/yales-assure-lock-2-is-down-to-its-lowest-price-ever-182029122.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-03 18:20:29+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Sony\u2019s next pair of budget earbuds will reportedly cost $120 when they arrive this month", "description": "<p>Sony\u2019s upcoming WF-C700N earbuds have leaked courtesy of Best Buy.

I asked a handful of friends this question over the past week, and a surprising number confirmed this strange new word had recently popped up in their news feeds, attached to stories from <em>The New York Times</em>, <em>CNN</em> and <em>Vanity Fair</em>. My friends didn\u2019t quite know what it was, aside from the vague notion that it was related to the Real Housewives shows. More importantly, they didn\u2019t know why it was being recommended to them, considering they didn\u2019t follow Bravo shows or reality television.</p><p>That\u2019s because this is the March Madness of reality TV. The Scandoval is an explosive cheating scandal involving the cast of <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> \u2014 and it\u2019s unfolding in real time, with cameras on, allowing viewers to look for signs of deceit in every scene as it airs. There are clear villains and an obvious heroine, and it\u2019s all leading up to the reunion, which was filmed at the end of March and has already provided a drip feed of drama and staged paparazzi encounters. The Scandoval is so monumental in the Bravo multiverse that it\u2019s culturally important for people outside of this bubble to know what\u2019s going on \u2014 just like folks who don\u2019t follow sports are subjected to the NCAA\u2019s media cycle every year.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img alt=\"THE REAL HOUSEWIVES OF MIAMI -- \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/b5707b90-d239-11ed-bfff-68a0f68b4ad4\" style=\"height: 664; width: 1000;\" /><figcaption>The Real Housewives of Miami</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Jeff Daly/Peacock</div></figure><p>It\u2019s not all about the Scandoval, either.

Nearly every Housewives franchise is popping off in its own special way, and many of them are making mainstream news headlines: Jen Shah of <em>Salt Lake City</em> was just sentenced to six and a half years in prison for running a telemarketing scam and her surprise arrest was caught on camera; Erika Jayne of <em>Beverly Hills</em> continues to display obscene greed as her estranged husband, disbarred lawyer Tom Girardi, is federally indicted on charges he stole millions of dollars from victims of corporate malfeasance. <em>Miami</em>, a streaming-only series exclusive to Peacock, just wrapped a beautiful fifth season and cemented itself as a blueprint for future Housewives shows; <em>Ultimate Girls Trip</em>, a crossover event that brings wives together like the third act of a Marvel film, is in its third season and already serving hype for its fourth. <em>Married to Medicine</em> continues to be a powerful, captivating and hilarious franchise centered on Black women and doctors in Georgia, and it\u2019s bringing in a notorious wife from the <em>Atlanta</em> history books for its upcoming season.</p><p>That\u2019s not even all of it, and the above list doesn\u2019t address the biggest bit of Bravo drama happening right now: the Scandoval. Here\u2019s a brief summary, for the culture: <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> is a spin-off of <em>Beverly Hills</em> starring the servers and bartenders of trendy Los Angeles restaurants. Its tenth season is currently airing, and as it kicked off, news broke that Tom Sandoval, a bar owner with Peter Pan syndrome, had been cheating on his partner of nine years, Ariana Madix, with a younger cast member named Raquel Leviss for the past six months. Details about the affair have been dripping out online \u2014 lightning bolt necklaces will never be the same \u2014 and viewers are scouring each new episode for signs of the pair\u2019s lies. Meanwhile, Bravo picked cameras back up after the affair came to light, and the mid-season trailer promises intense, intimate reactions from everyone involved, plus plenty of vengeful edits for Ariana. The reunion is poised to be a spectacle like Bravo has never seen.</p><figure><img alt=\"VANDERPUMP RULES -- Pictured: (l-r) Raquel Leviss, Ariana Madix, Scheana Shay -- (Photo by: Nicole Weingart/Bravo)\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/b5753680-d239-11ed-bff3-4ea04314475a\" style=\"height: 667; width: 1000;\" /><figcaption>Vanderpump Rules</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Nicole Weingart/Bravo</div></figure><p>To put it back in sports terms: The Scandoval is like David Beckham cheating on Victoria with Emma Bunton. Or like Scottie Pippen\u2019s ex-wife starting a relationship with Michael Jordan\u2019s son \u2014 a storyline that literally happened on the latest season of <em>Miami</em>. See? As Quad said on season nine of <em>Married to Medicine</em> when asked whether she\u2019d cheated on past boyfriends, <em>our cup runneth over</em>.</p><p>This all means Peacock is getting my money for the foreseeable future, no high-budget original series required. I mean, I loved <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/poker-face-season-one-preview-160035861.html\"><em><ins>Poker Face</ins></em></a>, but I haven\u2019t thought about it much since watching the final episode of season one. Housewives and its related series live outside of the app, on message boards and social media and podcasts, filling the silence even between seasons. Meanwhile, the Scandoval is <a href=\"https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/vanderpump-rules-ratings-spike-bravo-scandoval-1235555509/\"><ins>driving viewership for Peacock</ins></a>, where <em>Vanderpump</em> is available to stream next-day. Peacock is also the only place to watch <em>Miami</em> and <em>Ultimate Girls Trip</em>, two shows that already make it essential in my own app lineup. I never expected to get so much use out of an NBC streaming service, but here we are.</p><p>The next app to get my business will be whichever one picks up <em>Married at First Sight Australia</em>. If you\u2019ve made it to this point in <em>this</em> article \u2014 a Real Housewives fever dream somehow published on a technology website \u2014 do yourself a favor and find a way to watch it (in between <em>Vanderpump Rules </em>episodes, of course).</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/bravos-scandoval-has-made-peacock-my-number-one-streaming-app-163020121.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/bravos-scandoval-has-made-peacock-my-number-one-streaming-app-163020121.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-03 16:30:20+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "These are the astronauts that will fly on NASA's Artemis 2 mission around the Moon", "description": "<p>NASA has finally named the astronauts that will orbit the Moon during the Artemis 2 mission.

The two embrace after five years apart, one of Greez's four arms now replaced by a robotic prosthetic. It's a moment that encapsulates how I felt playing the upcoming game at a recent preview event Electronic Arts and Respawn Entertainment held in Los Angeles. Playing <em>Jedi: Survivor</em> feels like reuniting with a friend you haven\u2019t seen in a few years.&nbsp;</p><div id=\"461b102a371448f2b8a2dd56b16f669f\"></div><p>Right from the start, <em>Jedi: Survivor</em> feels like a more refined <em>Jedi:</em><em>Fallen Order</em>. The preview began on Koboh, one of the first planets players will visit when they get their hands on the game later this month. Exploring Koboh is immediately compelling since Cal has all the abilities he rediscovered by the end of <em>Jedi:</em><em>Fallen Order, </em>plus a new grappling hook for quickly traversing across some gaps. Cal also feels more satisfying to control, as there\u2019s more weight and precision to his movements. When he jumps, he doesn\u2019t float the way he did in <em>Jedi:</em><em>Fallen Order</em>. In combat, Cal feels more deadly and proficient with his lightsaber.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>\u201cCal has a bit of swagger now, and that was intentional. We wanted the player to feel that,\u201d Game Director Stig Asmussen tells me during a break from the preview. \u201cKeep in mind [<em>Jedi:</em><em>Fallen Order</em>] was the first time for us,\u201d he says. Before <em>Jedi: Fallen Order</em>, those who worked at the studio were best known for creating first-person shooters like Titanfall and Call of Duty. \u201cWe were learning while we were making that game \u2013 we\u2019re still learning \u2013 but as we were building it, we got better at building it.\u201d</p><figure><img alt=\"Cal looking at the environment of Koboh. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/52f11d70-d230-11ed-9f77-032a36c6288d\" style=\"height: 1000; width: 1600;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Respawn Entertainment / EA</div></figure><p>Asmussen and his team have also hit a comfortable stride in executing the specific demands of the series they\u2019re building. Take<em>&nbsp;</em>Koboh, for instance. I can safely say it is larger and more intricate than Zeffo, <em>Jedi:</em><em>Fallen Order\u2019s </em>most fully realized planet. Asmussen recommended those of us at the event stick to the game\u2019s critical path to see as much as the preview had to offer, but I couldn\u2019t help but get sidetracked by all the optional content I found on Koboh. One of my favorite discoveries involved an ancient ruin with a particularly devious puzzle inside that had me stumped for a few minutes. Another highlight involved investigating an abandoned mine that it turned out was home to a deadly rancor.</p><p>Koboh also does something surprising for the series. Early in his first visit to the planet, Cal comes across a small settlement of people trying to eke out an existence away from both the Empire and a local gang of raiders. The game offers a few options here. Cal can talk with the townsfolk, take on a side quest to explore the aforementioned mine and trade with a merchant who will give you cosmetics in exchange for crystals you can find throughout the game. Cal can also visit a canteen full of colorful characters, including a smooth-talking droid bartender named MXNK-6. The inclusion of a hub world might not be mechanically groundbreaking, but it goes a long way to making Koboh feel less like a level in a video game and more like a place that could actually exist in a galaxy far, far away.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten better as storytellers,\u201d Asmussen says. &quot;There were very important decisions we had to nail down while making the first game \u2013 like how high could Cal jump \u2013 before we could have conversations about how to decorate this corner to make it feel like an authentic, lived-in space.\u201d</p><div id=\"586b66f02a144f30b5efa35511e15870\"></div><p>I didn\u2019t progress far enough in the game to unlock some of Cal\u2019s more exciting new tools, including the crossguard lightsaber and blaster pistol, but at the end of the preview, I did get to see a Respawn developer put those weapons to use. In combination with his Force powers, Cal\u2019s new armaments allow for more creative ways to approach combat. At one point in the showcase, the dev lifted all of the scout troopers in front of him, and then proceeded to shoot them all out of the air with a series of rapid blaster bolts. It wasn\u2019t a very Jedi way of dispatching Cal\u2019s enemies, but I would be lying if I told you it didn\u2019t look cool.</p><p>One other thing the dev did was use Cal\u2019s entire move set, including all five of his available combat stances, without resting at a meditation circle to switch between them. In the preview, I could only map two of Cal\u2019s available stances to the d-pad. The combat showcase was the last thing Respawn showed during the preview, so I didn\u2019t get a chance to ask questions about what I saw. But if I had to take a guess, you can eventually freely switch between all of Cal\u2019s combat styles.</p><figure><img alt=\"Greez, Cal's old companion from Jedi: Fallen Order, now has a robotic prosthetic for one of his arms. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/c6d9a950-d230-11ed-bfce-d8ebb46d63c7\" style=\"height: 1000; width: 1600;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Respawn Entertainment / EA</div></figure><p>If that sounds intimidating, you\u2019re free to play <em>Jedi:</em><em>Survivor</em> like an RPG. Cal\u2019s progression occurs across multiple skill trees, with each one dedicated to a different aspect of his kit. Additionally, there\u2019s a new perk system that allows you to further augment Cal\u2019s combat abilities. Asmussen said it\u2019s possible to earn enough skill points to unlock all of Cal\u2019s skills, but you can also choose to specialize in the combat abilities that fit your playstyle. On that note, there are also more options for customizing Cal\u2019s appearance. The clothing system is more robust, allowing you to change individual parts of Cal\u2019s outfit. You can also give him different haircuts and beards.</p><p>At the end of the preview, I left even more excited to play <em>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor </em>than when I first arrived at the event. I will say it does feel like a safe sequel. I didn\u2019t get to see some of the game\u2019s more interesting new mechanics, including Cal\u2019s newfound ability to tame mounts and fight with NPC companions, but I doubt those additions will transform the series into something it wasn\u2019t before. If <em>Jedi:</em><em>Fallen Order</em> didn\u2019t do it for you, <em>Jedi:</em><em>Survivor</em> is unlikely to change your mind. For everyone else, I think what you can expect is a bigger and better realization of Respawn\u2019s original vision. <em>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</em> arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and PC on <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/star-wars-jedi-survivor-delayed-to-april-28th-220058242.html\">April 28th</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/star-wars-jedi-survivor-preview-cal-were-home-150301468.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/star-wars-jedi-survivor-preview-cal-were-home-150301468.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-03 15:03:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The Apple Watch SE drops back to $219", "description": "<p>The <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMEJESk0zMTUxLz90aD0xJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXI0LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI5NWNmMmNlZS02ZTRhLTQyMWMtODUzZC05MmE0ZDhiYWFiYmMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfAkgCAk1uiWiKOLeoc3XiArr5-L0wnCGWPCmeM68wxl&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BDJM3151%2F%3Fth%3D1\">Apple Watch SE</a> is back on sale for $219 at <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMEJESjFNVkJWLz90aD0xJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXI0LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI5NWNmMmNlZS02ZTRhLTQyMWMtODUzZC05MmE0ZDhiYWFiYmMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAbc95PCbOY71cUekAd6s9ZpsV8EKqDnPxNz9NeBvJ4Xt&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BDJ1MVBV%2F%3Fth%3D1\">Amazon</a> and <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5e0bed65-d2f8-4b34-9b8f-955218c0e37a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Best+Buy&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI1ZTBiZWQ2NS1kMmY4LTRiMzQtOWI4Zi05NTUyMThjMGUzN2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmVzdGJ1eS5jb20vc2l0ZS9hcHBsZS13YXRjaC1zZS0ybmQtZ2VuZXJhdGlvbi1ncHMtNDBtbS1hbHVtaW51bS1jYXNlLXdpdGgtbWlkbmlnaHQtc3BvcnQtYmFuZC1tLWwtbWlkbmlnaHQvNjM0MDIzOC5wIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI5NWNmMmNlZS02ZTRhLTQyMWMtODUzZC05MmE0ZDhiYWFiYmMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdVVJ8IP3rC2P6gTffefM9D0H2p2edrP8V0zlInpHmY2&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-watch-se-2nd-generation-gps-40mm-aluminum-case-with-midnight-sport-band-m-l-midnight%2F6340238.p\">Best Buy</a>, bringing what was already one of the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-se-2022-review-battery-life-workout-health-tracking-144551799.html\">better values</a> on the wearable market within $10 of the lowest price we've tracked.

Compared to the flagship <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-8-real-world-test-130031046.html\">Apple Watch Series 8</a>, the SE lacks more advanced health-tracking features like a skin temperature sensor, ECG monitor and blood oxygen sensor, and its slightly smaller display doesn't have an always-on mode, so it's more cumbersome for checking the time. It also charges slower than the Series 8 or higher-end <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-ultra-review-battery-life-compass-gps-hike-130055477.html\">Apple Watch Ultra</a>. For the most part, though, it provides the usual Apple Watch feature set at a lower price, with notifications, heart-rate monitoring, crash detection and a similar-looking, water-resistant design. This second-gen model runs on the same S8 processor as its pricier siblings, too, so it's just as fast in day-to-day use.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>That processor bump is the biggest upgrade from the first-gen Apple Watch SE, but most people with that device shouldn't feel the need to upgrade here. Instead, this model is best for folks upgrading from an older Apple Watch (say, a Series 4 or older) or iPhone owners looking to buy an Apple wearable for the first time without spending more than $300. If that describes you, this deal should make the device a bit more approachable.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter and </em><a href=\"https://subscription.yahoo.net/Newsletter/Preference/sub?b=engadgetdeals&amp;src\"><em>subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter</em></a><em> for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-apple-watch-se-drops-back-to-219-144032655.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/the-apple-watch-se-drops-back-to-219-144032655.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-03 14:40:32+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Amazon's Kindle is back on sale for $80", "description": "<p>Amazon is <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAYrQ6g-jqCmXpjhaY6a8RYZidmXqufC2j884Zkzwepnh&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdeal%2F93b9218e%3Fpf_rd_r%3DE1TKC4PM1J55K8YNZBHD%26pf_rd_t%3DEvents%26pf_rd_i%3Ddeals%26pf_rd_p%3Ddc130d28-ed41-4ad7-814b-d0f54ed4fb3b%26pf_rd_s%3Dslot-15%26ref%3Ddlx_deals_gd_dcl_tlt_10_93b9218e_mw_sl15_3b\">running a sale</a> on Kindle e-readers just in time for outdoor reading, and there are a few good deals in the mix.

And now, Twitter is displaying the <a href=\"https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/twitter-updates-verified-user-descriptions-paid-blue-check-1235571165/\">same status</a> for both legacy verified and Twitter Blue subscribers, making it difficult to tell them apart.&nbsp;</p><p>Verified legacy Twitter users were expecting to lose their white-on-blue checkmarks over the weekend, after the Twitter Verified account tweeted it would start stripping them on April 1st. For the most part, however, that didn't happen, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/03/31/twitter-verification-checkmark-ending/\">reportedly</a> because un-verifying users is a painstaking manual process (Musk tweeted in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MattBinder/status/1642401198731935747\">now-deleted message</a> that legacy users would be given \"a few weeks grace\"). However, Twitter<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-03/new-york-times-loses-blue-check-mark-after-drawing-musk-ire\"> did strip</a> a verified badge from <em>The New York Times</em> after the site said it wouldn't pay for Twitter Blue, in an apparent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1642383150230773760\">fit of pique</a> by CEO Elon Musk.

That follows tweets from a number of top users like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KingJames/status/1641836984195743749\">LeBron James</a> and <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2023/03/31/twitter-verification-white-house-biden-check-mark\">The White House</a> that they would never pay for a subscription.&nbsp;</p><p>\"It is our understanding that Twitter Blue does not provide person-level verification as a service. Thus, a blue check mark will now simply serve as a verification that the account is a paid user,\" White House digital strategy director Rob Flaherty told staffers in a memo. Numerous other accounts tweeted a similar sentiment, with some noting that celebrities, journalists and other influential users are the <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/03/what-made-pre-elon-musk-twitter-relevant\">primary drivers</a> of Twitter traffic.</p><p>Topping off the drama, Twitter just changed the tags that appears when you click on a verified badge. Before, it gave separate messages for Twitter Blue subscribers (\"This account is verified because it\u2019s subscribed to Twitter Blue\") and legacy verified users (\"This is a legacy verified account. It may or may not be notable.\"). Now, it displays the same message for both: \"This account is verified because it\u2019s subscribed to Twitter Blue or is a legacy verified account.\"</p><figure><img alt=\"twitter verification\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/0507abb0-d20d-11ed-9fcd-f31e0ea554fb\" style=\"height: 275; width: 692;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Engadget</div></figure><p>Some users applauded the revised tags as more egalitarian, but others said the message would make it harder to tell if users were genuine accounts or impersonators. That was the exact problem that delayed the rollout of Twitter Blue <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-blue-verification-impersonation-disaster-203656712.html\">back in November</a>, if you'll recall.

The program has reportedly met with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/24/twitter-blue-subscriptions-spendings-mobile-users/\">limited success</a> to date, and Elon Musk recently told employees that Twitter was worth <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/24/twitter-blue-subscriptions-spendings-mobile-users/\">less than half</a> what he paid for it, according to several reports.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/twitter-stokes-confusion-as-verified-drama-continues-104321432.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/twitter-stokes-confusion-as-verified-drama-continues-104321432.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-03 10:43:21+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Paris votes to ban e-scooter rentals", "description": "<p>Paris residents have dealt a blow to e-scooter rental companies <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/lime-1-kwh-battery-announced-162556009.html\">Lime</a>, Tier and Dott, voting in an <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20230402-parisians-vote-to-ban-for-hire-e-scooter-rentals-from-french-capital?ref=tw_i\">89 percent landslide</a> to ban &quot;trotinettes&quot; from streets amid low voter turnout, <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20230402-parisians-vote-to-ban-for-hire-e-scooter-rentals-from-french-capital\"><em>France 24</em></a> has reported. The French capital will likely become the second European city after Barcelona to prohibit the devices, as mayor Anne Hidalgo has promised to respect the referendum.

A spate of accidents ensued including a <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20210630-france-to-crack-down-on-e-scooters-after-two-riders-knock-down-and-kill-woman\">2021 fatality</a>, prodding the city to introduce new rules like a 10 km/h (6 MPH) speed limit in designated zones and fines for for not using dedicated parking. However, residents continued to complain about dangerous operation and devices strewn on city sidewalks.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Only eight percent of city dwellers voted, and that group appeared to skew away from younger people more likely to use the devices. &quot;In the double queue here, a majority of 50+ and parents with toddlers,&quot; tweeted journalist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AgnesCPoirier/status/1642561836917637120\">Agnes Poirier</a>. &quot;Incapable of regulating their use, the City of Paris is just leaving it to its inhabitants in an all or nothing alternative.&quot;</p><p>The move may be welcomed by some, but it goes against Hidalgo's initiatives to make Paris less polluted and dependent on cars. As part of a pledge to be <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/climate-action/un-global-climate-action-awards/climate-leaders/city-of-paris\">carbon neutral by 2050</a>, the city has vowed to phase out ICE (internal combustion engine) vehicles by 2030, <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/08/paris-trees-climate-change/\">plant up to 170,000 trees</a>, install <a href=\"https://www.greencarcongress.com/2018/07/20180705-paris.html\">electric chargers for EVs</a> and promote e-mobility, including e-bikes and, at one time, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/22/lime-scooters-are-live-in-paris/\">e-scooters</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The city has since changed its tune on the latter, though. It noted that the scooters were mostly replacing walking or public transport rather than cars or taxi trips, so weren't achieving the goal of reducing vehicle use. &quot;They\u2019re honestly not very ecological \u2014 they get damaged and they are left lying wherever,&quot; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Anne_Hidalgo/status/1618512533765386241\">said Hidalgo back in January</a>, adding that she was personally in favor of a ban. &quot;We can\u2019t contain them in public spaces and they\u2019re causing road safety problems, especially for older and disabled people.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/paris-votes-to-ban-e-scooter-rentals-082352303.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/paris-votes-to-ban-e-scooter-rentals-082352303.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-03 08:23:52+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
