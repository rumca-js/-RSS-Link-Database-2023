On what charges? We don't know. Something about paying off porn star Stormy Daniels. But it's unclear what, if anything, is illegal about that, and the indictment is currently sealed. </p><p>Trump arrived in New York City today ahead of his arraignment, which prompted Mayor Eric Adams to hold a briefing on security preparations for the city. Specifically, he warned Trump supporters to \"control\" themselves. </p><p><em>\"There may be some rabble rousers thinking about coming to our city tomorrow...Our message is clear and simple: control yourselves.\"</em></p><p><em>\"NYC is our home, not a playground for your misplaced anger...although we have no specific threats, people like Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is known to spread misinformation and hate speech, stated she is coming to town.\"</em></p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cEric Adams tells Trump supporters to \"control yourselves\"\\n\\n\"NYC is our home, not a playground for your misplaced anger...although we have no specific threats, people like Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is known to spread misinformation and hate speech, stated she is coming to town.\"\\u201d</div> \u2014 Washington Free Beacon (@Washington Free Beacon)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FreeBeacon/status/1642923363839483908\">1680538428</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He also claimed that New York City respects the rule of law and does not allow any sort of vandalism or violence. Which is weird, because I feel like I remember <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bill-deblasio-protesters-social-distance\" target=\"_blank\">something a few years ago</a> where the <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/riots-by-the-numbers-police-casualties-people-killed-during-peaceful-protests\" target=\"_blank\">city was overrun with violence</a> and arson for months. And from what I've heard of New York City nowadays, it's still not <em>exactly</em> a safe haven. Particularly not the <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/green-goblin-gang-identified\" target=\"_blank\">subway.</a></p><p>And I can't help but wonder how Adams would have reacted differently if, say, Joe Biden were indicted and people wanted to protest. The most recent comparable event that sparked protests was the death of <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tyre-nichols-nyc-memphis-protest\" target=\"_blank\">Tyre</a><a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tyre-nichols-nyc-memphis-protest\"> Nichols</a>, which prompted Adams to <a href=\"https://www.silive.com/news/2023/01/nyc-mayor-adams-calls-for-peaceful-protests-as-city-prepares-for-unrest-after-tyre-nichols-murder-reports.html?utm_campaign=siadvance_sf&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter\" target=\"_blank\">call for peaceful protests</a>: <em>\"I</em><em> think the Memphis police chief responded swiftly, and I believe New Yorkers have the right to peacefully voice their concern if the video is what we anticipate it will be. </em><em>This police department is the best at responding to any form of protests.\" </em>Which sounds a whole lot different than \"control yourselves\". </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Lily is a Zoomer college dropout who somehow landed a writing gig here at LwC.com.

But as it turns out, it wasn't true. Shocking. </p><p>Media <a href=\"https://notthebee.com/article/mainstream-media-reported-that-a-florida-principal-was-let-go-over-a-controversy-involving-michelangelos-david-statue-but-it-turns-out-thats-not-true\" target=\"_blank\">claimed</a> parents deemed the lesson about the statue to be pornographic. This was clearly meant to hit back at Governor DeSantis's <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/search/?q=florida+bans+porn\" target=\"_blank\">policies that ban porn </a>in schools. Since Michelaneglo's work clearly <em>isn't</em> porn, the media tried to frame the story as if DeSantis's policies and conservative parents are ridiculously Puritan and actually limiting children's education. </p><p>But they're not, of course. DeSantis and conservatives literally just want to ban porn in library books. Because <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-book-banning\" target=\"_blank\">there was literally porn in library books</a>. And that's something most parents would call a <em>\"problem.\"</em></p><p>Plus, the principal in question wasn't even fired for this lesson. Mark Hemingway of RealClearInvestigations sleuthed this out by reading past the headline of CNN's article, in which they admitted the principal wasn't fired for the lesson. </p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/style/article/florida-principal-fired-david-statue/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> quoted the school board chair as saying, \"She was not let go because of Michelangelo's David lesson.\" </p><p>Oh. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cBang-up job CNN \\u2014 your own story contradicts your deliberately misleading headline designed to further a political narrative.\\u201d</div> \u2014 Mark Hemingway (@Mark Hemingway)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Heminator/status/1639976009704374274\">1679835724</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It goes on to explain: </p><p><em>\"'Our school is two and a half years old. Every year we show that picture in the Renaissance Art class taught to our sixth graders,'  [the school board chair] added. The problem that arose in this instance was that the procedure for notifying parents of the upcoming lesson was not followed.\"</em></p><p><em>\"'We aren't trying to ban the picture,' he said, referring to the statue of David. 'We think it's beautiful, but we are going to make sure the concept of parental rights is supreme in Florida and at our charter school.'\"</em></p><p>And 97% of the parents were fine with the lesson. So no, Florida schools do not consider beautiful pieces of Renaissance artwork to be pornographic. They consider pornographic library books to be pornographic. And they just want to make sure parents are aware of what their children are being taught. </p><p>The audacity. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Lily is a Zoomer college dropout who somehow landed a writing gig here at LwC.com.

Today, Crowder detailed what exactly YouTube decided warranted these strikes. </p><p>Three videos were removed - one was the show about Trump's arrest, which YouTube deemed was \"harassment\". The <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nashville-shooting-unsenored-show-notes\" target=\"_blank\">second</a> was about the <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nashville-updates-show-notes\" target=\"_blank\">Nashville shooting</a>, which YouTube claimed was \"hate speech\". And the real kicker was a Crowderbits <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/13-year-old-dancing-adults\" target=\"_blank\">featuring a 13-year-old drag performer</a>. YouTube struck this one for its child safety policy sexualizing minors. Even though it literally showed an example of a child's safety being violated in real life. But YouTube doesn't seem to care about that. </p><p>Plus, Crowder highlighted how there are at least a dozen of videos on YouTube from OTHER creators covering the exact same event featuring the child drag queen. He explained how this shows YouTube is selectively applying and enforcing its rules. </p><p>Crowder explained that all of the videos removed had to do with transgenderism. He also said YouTube is trying to eliminate competition, due to the huge exodus from YouTube to Rumble. Long-term, Louder with Crowder's goal is to stream exclusively to Rumble, due to the rampant YouTube censorship and selective enforcement of rules, as evidence by these latest strikes. </p><p>Crowder elaborated on YouTube's biased censorship tactics, explaining: <em>\"If you have everyone on the left, the entire Democratic Party, who push legislatively for the castration of children, the chemical castration of children [...] You can support that on YouTube and it will be allowed to be up. But if you speak critically, it will be removed.\"</em></p><p>Crowder then highlighted how these policies eliminate all dialogue by removing one side of the argument. And not only are the policies dishonest, but they mean our country is doomed to fail. </p><p>The full episode is available exclusively on Rumble all the time, but especially now. For obvious Big Tech reasons. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rumble\">\n\n</p>\n<p><br /></p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Lily is a Zoomer college dropout who somehow landed a writing gig here at LwC.com.

/><br /><br /><p>It's a sad day in America, my friends. <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/barefoot-mcdonalds-answers\" target=\"_blank\">McDonald's</a> has shut all of its offices based in the United States in anticipation of layoffs. </p><p>International employees were told via email to work from home until this Wednesday so layoff notices can be delivered virtually. They also asked all employees to cancel all in-person meetings with vendors at its headquarters. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cMcDonald's Corp\\u00a0is temporarily closing its U.S. offices this week as it prepares to inform corporate employees about its layoffs as part of a broader company restructuring, the Wall Street Journal\\u00a0reported\\u00a0on Sunday\\n#McDonalds \\nhttps://t.co/5Ojafaj6gg\\u201d</div> \u2014 The Telegraph (@The Telegraph)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ttindia/status/1642711640687927297\">1680487949</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It's unclear how many employees will be laid off. Chief Executive Chris Kempczinski previously said the move would save money, but didn't elaborate on how much they hope to save. So we can probably chalk it up to Sleepy Joe's economy. </p><p>Unfortunately, there's more bad news. The <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/grandpa-mcdonalds-weight\" target=\"_blank\">McDonald's</a> menu might change, too. An email from January that warned of the coming layoffs also suggested menus could be simplified with less duplication. AKA variety. </p><p>The CEO wrote, \"We had across the globe 70 different, distinct versions of what a crispy chicken sandwich would look like. I don't need 70 different permutations of a chicken sandwich.\" The sass is palpable. </p><p>I've always thought Mickey D's variety across the globe was one of the most, if not the <em>only</em>, interesting things about the chain. YouTube is full of videos of people trying foreign McDonald's menus. Like the McArabia Chicken in the United Arab Emirates, which is a sandwich of grilled chicken and garlic sauce between Arabic bread. Or in Japan, the Bai Teriyaki Chicken Fillet-O or the McSpicy Shanghai Burger. Spain has a McCrispy Honey Mustard, and Britain has a Mayo Chicken. Which sounds pretty boring to me. But I'll let the Brits be with their mayonnaise. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cWill McDonald's US shake up affect menus around the world? Fears for fast food as giant prepares to layoff staff https://t.co/gx5Chx4Uko\\u201d</div> \u2014 Daily Mail Online (@Daily Mail Online)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MailOnline/status/1642873831646810112\">1680526619</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I'm no business man, but I would think cutting the global variety of foods would just make fans unhappy. But perhaps so many people eat at McDonald's anyway, they can afford to make some menu cuts. As long as they don't take the McFlurries.

They also asked all employees to cancel all in-person meetings with vendors at its headquarters. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cMcDonald's Corp\\u00a0is temporarily closing its U.S. offices this week as it prepares to inform corporate employees about its layoffs as part of a broader company restructuring, the Wall Street Journal\\u00a0reported\\u00a0on Sunday\\n#McDonalds \\nhttps://t.co/5Ojafaj6gg\\u201d</div> \u2014 The Telegraph (@The Telegraph)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ttindia/status/1642711640687927297\">1680487949</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It's unclear how many employees will be laid off. Chief Executive Chris Kempczinski previously said the move would save money, but didn't elaborate on how much they hope to save. So we can probably chalk it up to Sleepy Joe's economy. </p><p>Unfortunately, there's more bad news. The <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/grandpa-mcdonalds-weight\" target=\"_blank\">McDonald's</a> menu might change, too. An email from January that warned of the coming layoffs also suggested menus could be simplified with less duplication. AKA variety. </p><p>The CEO wrote, \"We had across the globe 70 different, distinct versions of what a crispy chicken sandwich would look like. I don't need 70 different permutations of a chicken sandwich.\" The sass is palpable. </p><p>I've always thought Mickey D's variety across the globe was one of the most, if not the <em>only</em>, interesting things about the chain. YouTube is full of videos of people trying foreign McDonald's menus. Like the McArabia Chicken in the United Arab Emirates, which is a sandwich of grilled chicken and garlic sauce between Arabic bread. Or in Japan, the Bai Teriyaki Chicken Fillet-O or the McSpicy Shanghai Burger. Spain has a McCrispy Honey Mustard, and Britain has a Mayo Chicken. Which sounds pretty boring to me. But I'll let the Brits be with their mayonnaise. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cWill McDonald's US shake up affect menus around the world?

But perhaps so many people eat at McDonald's anyway, they can afford to make some menu cuts. As long as they don't take the McFlurries.

She defended calling the entire Democratic Party \"pedophiles\". Host Lesley Stahl seemed quite shocked, to say the least. </p><p>Stahl repeated MTG's claim to her that the Democratic Party is full of pedos, and waited for her response. But instead of couching her words or going on the defense, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/marjorie-taylor-greene-toxic-masculinity\" target=\"_blank\">Greene</a> simply said, \"I would definitely say so. They support grooming children.\" </p><p>Of course Stahl denied this, totally incredulous at the idea. But Greene elaborated, \"Even Joe Biden, the president himself, supports children being sexualized and having transgender surgeries. Sexualizing children is what pedophiles do to children.\"</p><p>Stahl's only response was \"wow,\" along with a sassy little eye roll. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cMTG calls out grooming and leaves Lesley Stahl literally speechless\\u201d</div> \u2014 End Wokeness (@End Wokeness)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EndWokeness/status/1642669722482163717\">1680477955</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So that was pretty bold of our gal MTG. But it wasn't the only bold moment of the interview. MTG also said we should stop funding a proxy war in Ukraine and push for peace instead.</p><p>Stahl asked the totally-not-leading question, \"You're opposed to giving Ukraine weapons and aid to help Ukraine fight off the Russians. It strikes me that that's what Putin wants.\"</p><p>MTG fired back, \"I don't really care what Putin wants [...] What I have voted against is funding a war in Ukraine. The entire time I have been saying the United States needs to be pushing for peace in Ukraine. Not funding a proxy war with Russia.\" </p><p>Stahl pushed back with various arguments, like \"Putin will invade Poland!\" and \"What about China?\" But MTG held firm, simply explaining, \"I'm sorry, but Ukraine is not the 51st state.\" Which many of our political leaders seem to have forgotten. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cMarjorie Taylor Greene on 60 minutes: \"The United States needs to be pushing for peace in Ukraine, not funding a proxy war with Russia.\" @RepMTG\\u201d</div> \u2014 3sidedstory \\ud83c\\uddfa\\ud83c\\uddf2 (@3sidedstory \\ud83c\\uddfa\\ud83c\\uddf2)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/3sidedstory/status/1642683868477280257\">1680481328</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Love her or hate her, MTG is certainly a firecracker. And it's very refreshing to see a Republican politician stand firm in their beliefs and not try to please everyone in the room. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Lily is a Zoomer college dropout who somehow landed a writing gig here at LwC.com.

Here's what gives me much amusement over this decision. I'm racking my brain, and I can't think of a single girl who has celebrated at least 7,665 days of being a girl who ever got an endorsement deal, their own Bud Light commercial, or their own Bud Light can. Yet Dylan is a girl for a fraction of that and gets accolades. Looks like everything feminists said about the patriarchy is right!</p><p>The patriarchy goes man, woman born a man, woman born a man who recognizes how easy it is to become famous on TikTok, biological man who capes for women that were born men, woman. This stands in contrast to the left's pound-for-pound most marginalized rankings where trans is undefeated and undisputed at #1 and every other group battles it out to crack into the top five.</p><p>All we can hope at this point is for a whistleblower to leak about the decision-making process. Somewhere in a America, in a conference room, a group of marketing professionals pitched and discussed this idea as a good one. OR, one person made the suggestion, and everyone else was afraid to speak up.</p><p>Our DMs are open, whistleblowers.
