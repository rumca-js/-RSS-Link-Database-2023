<p>The Chinese government is instituting a cybersecurity review of US-based memory chip maker Micron’s products being sold in the country, in the latest move in the ongoing semiconductor trade dispute that pits China against the US and its allies.</p><p>The rupture between China and the West over semiconductors is causing chip supply chain disruptions that threaten many of the fastest-growing parts of the technology sector – mainly AI and cloud technology.

<p>The PC industry slowdown may finally have caught up with Apple, if the latest slice of industry gossip is to be believed. A new report <a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=20468" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">emanating from Korea</a> says Apple suspended production of its M2 series processors — the chips used in the MacBook Pro, MacBook Air and Mac mini — in January.</p><h2><strong>Feeling the pressure?</strong></h2>
<p>The report says third-party companies that work with processors supplied by TSMC for packaging had to cease production in January and February because orders slowed so much. It adds that while production began again at some point in February, it did so at “half the level of the previous year."</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3692549/has-the-pc-market-slowdown-finally-hit-the-mac.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<p><em>Ransomware</em>.</p><p>It’s one word that can strike a chill in anyone from a corporate C-suite to a home user. It’s sometimes hard to get a feel for the overall ransomware industry (and yes, it’s now an industry). But based on anecdotal reviews of forums and social media, it appears as though attacks against individuals are slowing. I no longer see people report they’ve been hit by ransomware on their PCs.</p><p>But it may be that attackers have realized that going after “one-off” targets isn’t the best business plan.
