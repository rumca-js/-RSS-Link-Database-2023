It is of benefit not just on an individual level, but also for our roles within our family, our community and indeed our whole society.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/03/early-years-support-parents\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/03/early-years-support-parents", "date_published": "2023-04-03 11:00:15+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Manchester Arena bombing survivors file legal action against conspiracy theorist", "description": "<p>Richard D Hall accused of defamation and harassment after he claimed the attack never took place</p><p>Survivors of the Manchester Arena bombing have launched a legal action against a conspiracy theorist who has falsely claimed the attack was faked.</p><p>Martin Hibbert and his daughter Eve were severely injured in the terror attack at an Ariana Grande concert in 2017 that left 22 people dead.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/03/manchester-arena-bombing-survivors-file-legal-action-against-conspiracy-theorist\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/03/manchester-arena-bombing-survivors-file-legal-action-against-conspiracy-theorist", "date_published": "2023-04-03 10:40:18+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "India\u2019s Rahul Gandhi appeals against defamation verdict", "description": "<p>Opposition leader was found guilty last month, given suspended jail term and barred from parliament</p><p>The Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi has lodged an appeal against his conviction for defamation, aiming to overturn a judgment that resulted in his expulsion from parliament a year before a general election is due.</p><p>Gandhi, 52, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/23/rahul-gandhi-found-guilty-of-defaming-narendra-modi-india-prime-minister-remark-2019\">found guilty of defamation last month</a> in a case brought by a state politician from the prime minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) over comments Gandhi made in a 2019 speech that were deemed to be insulting to the prime minister and other people surnamed Modi.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/03/india-rahul-gandhi-appeals-against-defamation-verdict\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/03/india-rahul-gandhi-appeals-against-defamation-verdict", "date_published": "2023-04-03 10:39:29+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Poem of the week: Not It by Caitlin Doyle", "description": "<p>A children\u2019s game conveys the panic-inducing sensation of reaching adulthood, of being \u2018It\u2019 before being ready</p><p>\u201cNot It!\u201d we\u2019d shout before a round<br />of backyard hide-and-seek,<br />the last to say it left behind<br />to count down in the dark</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/03/poem-of-the-week-not-it-by-caitlin-doyle\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/03/poem-of-the-week-not-it-by-caitlin-doyle", "date_published": "2023-04-03 10:34:52+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Beverley Knight hails growing diversity of theatre audiences", "description": "<p>The Sylvia star, who won best supporting actress in a musical at the Olivier awards, said Old Vic show attracts \u2018people of all kinds of everywhere\u2019</p><ul><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/apr/02/olivier-awards-2023-full-list-of-winners\">Olivier awards: full list of winners</a></strong></li></ul><p>Theatre audiences are becoming more diverse, said the actor and singer Beverley Knight, who credited the Olivier award-winning musical Sylvia for attracting \u201cpeople of all kinds of everywhere\u201d.</p><p>Knight picked up the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/apr/02/my-neighbour-totoro-triumphs-at-olivier-awards\">prize for best supporting actress in a musical at the Olivier awards ceremony on Sunday night</a> for her performance as Emmeline Pankhurst in Sylvia, which is running at the Old Vic in London. \u201cA show like Sylvia makes theatre accessible,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are diverse on stage and I love that I look out and see diversity in age, in race and most likely in [theatregoers\u2019] financial situations, too.

Their record away from home against top 10 opposition could prove costly in the race for the Champions League. Though Newcastle United did not blow Ten Hag\u2019s team away like Liverpool did last month, they were deserved, easy victors. Ten Hag might look to the steel in midfield that was the core of Newcastle\u2019s win, with Bruno Guimar\u00e3es outstanding and Sean Longstaff supplying artisanship and exertion alongside him. It was not a gala Sunday afternoon for the Bruno Fernandes fan club, and Casemiro was again glaringly missed, even if he was among the guilty at Anfield. Ten Hag\u2019s late readjustment of his team, removing centre-backs to go for broke, backfired as Callum Wilson scored soon after. It is difficult to imagine Howe taking such high-risk gambles.

We join him when he\u2019s creeping out of Last Chance in the small hours, heading to a pond with a rucksack full of drum\u2019n\u2019bass tapes and, more ominously, rocks.<br /><br />What follows, over 128 pages, is his jumble of night thoughts as Shy looks back on the turning points that brought him to where he is, as well as his interactions with staff and other boys at Last Chance. The narration unfolds as a kind of spectral swirl of voices in which assorted weights and sizes of type indicate different timelines. Vivid scenes erupt like lightning in fog, from Shy\u2019s childhood anger at learning that Santa is actually his stepdad, to his slicing open another boy\u2019s head with broken glass during a town-centre fracas in his teens.</p><p>We\u2019re in 1995, the dog days of Tory rule under John Major, whose words \u2013 \u201cSociety needs to condemn a little more and understand a little less\u201d \u2013 Porter might have had pinned above his laptop to kick against. The result is exhilarating. One paragraph runs three-and-a-half pages without full stops to hustle us through the pile-up of bad luck and bad decisions that lead Shy to trash his school chemistry lab, having failed to lose his virginity after \u201cfiddling around trying to get the smelly, greasy-thick condom on, useless knob like a dumpling\u201d.<br /><br />Part of Porter\u2019s point is that there\u2019s more going on inside his protagonist than anyone sees. Listening to his jungle tapes, Shy hears the beat \u201ccrisp and juicy, mathematical perfection, up, up and away... Obviously he never says any of this... he just says Hardcore. Nice. Yeah.\u201d But while the novel keeps in view the difficulty for those on the sharp end of Shy\u2019s recklessness (his stepdad asks \u201cwhen will the Jekyll and Hyde shit end\u201d), there\u2019s an unhelpful tendency to portray him as an ambassador for a superior moral universe. When a staff member asks what Shy worries about, he says the rainforests \u201cand people slagging off Sting for giving a fuck... It winds me up.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/03/shy-by-max-porter-review-exhilarating-portrait-of-a-lost-boy-in-90s-britain-grief-is-the-thing-with-feathers\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/03/shy-by-max-porter-review-exhilarating-portrait-of-a-lost-boy-in-90s-britain-grief-is-the-thing-with-feathers", "date_published": "2023-04-03 06:00:43+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Would my mum lose her house and savings if she had to go into care?", "description": "<p>She wonders whether to give her property to me and my brother or buy a place with me</p><p><strong>Q</strong> My mum would like to give her property to me and my brother, as she is worried that if she had to go into a care home she would lose her house and savings.
