[{"source": "https://www.jefftk.com/news.rss", "title": "AWS Has Raised Prices Before", "description": "<p><span>\n\nThere's some speculation around whether AWS will need to raise\ntheir prices, as many tech companies announce inflation-driven\nincreases.  One consideration that people will sometimes give is that\nAWS has never raised prices before, except that this isn't quite true.\nThe following is not actually important, but I want to write it up\nanyway out of pedantry.\n\n</span>\n\n<p>\n\nWhen AWS S3 launched in <a href=\"https://press.aboutamazon.com/2006/3/amazon-web-services-launches\">March 2006</a> their initial pricing was:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\nStorage\n<br />\n$0.15 per GB-Month of storage used\n<p>\nData Transfer\n<br />\n$0.20 per GB - data uploaded\n$0.20 per GB - data downloaded\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nIn <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070502160305/http://www.amazon.com/S3-AWS-home-page-Money/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=16427261\">June\n2007</a> they switched to:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\nStorage<br />\n$0.15 per GB-Month of storage used\n<p>\nData Transfer<br />\n$0.10 per GB - all data uploaded<br />\n$0.18 per GB - first 10 TB / month data downloaded<br />\n$0.16 per GB - next 40 TB / month data downloaded<br />\n$0.13 per GB - data downloaded / month over 50 TB\n</p>\n<p>\nData transferred between Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2 is free of charge\n</p>\n<p>\nRequests<br />\n$0.01 per 1,000 PUT or LIST requests<br />\n$0.01 per 10,000 GET and all other requests*<br />\n* No charge for delete requests\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nThey went from requests being free to a low per-request charge,\nlowering the data transfer cost at the same time.  For very\nrequest-heavy workloads this was a price increase on balance, and some\ncustomers needed to make implementation changes to avoid sending so\nmany requests.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThat this was, as far as I know, the only time they've raised prices in\n15+ years is impressive, and speaks well of their commitment to\npredictability.  But it just annoys me when people claim they've never\ndone it.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid02jsx5bKfNsVeiuKJDD8BkKYSiSrTMsUdFLRDTJ8zkjMbtXeqezBrXgF5Jo74Nyp85l\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://lesswrong.com/posts/ip7mCxL28gPLGJoDYtech\">lesswrong</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@jefftk/110135699224357614\">mastodon</a></i></p>", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/aws-has-raised-prices-before", "date_published": "2023-04-03 08:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
