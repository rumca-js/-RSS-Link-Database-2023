<p dir="ltr">The Super Mario Bros. Movie won't stomp all over your (touch) fuzzy memories of the Nintendo icon, according to Chris Pratt. The actor, who voices Mario, believes the animated film is worthy of the video game character's legacy.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/chris-pratt-super-mario-bros-movie-mario-voice-reaction-premiere-1235365581/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Pratt acknowledged the trepidation of a new Mario movie and his casting for the titular role. "Just because something has reach doesn't mean it's going to be a good movie, and there's instances of people making bad movies and ruining people's childhoods," he said. "So the pressure was on to not do that and, thankfully, we didn't. I think the movie is fantastic, and I think your childhood is firmly intact.”</p><p dir="ltr">The Jurassic World and Guardians of the Galaxy star also admitted he was apprehensive at first about joining The Super Mario Bros. Movie. "It makes sense, I was pretty nervous when they offered it to me," said Pratt. "I thought, 'Wow, let's not screw this up.'"</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/chris-pratt-i-think-your-childhood-is-firmly-intact-super-mario-bros-movie-wont-ruin-it/1100-6512934/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The US Department of Justice <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-files-lawsuit-and-proposed-consent-decree-prohibit-activision-blizzard">filed a civil antitrust lawsuit</a> against the Call of Duty company, claiming Activision Blizzard made rules for Overwatch and Call of Duty esports leagues and players that were anticompetitive.

<p>Blizzard has officially revealed the new hero coming to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/">Overwatch 2</a> in Season 4, Lifeweaver.

As for how this fits into his healing abilities and his overall kit, Blizzard will likely reveal more about the new hero in the coming week. Overwatch 2 Season 4 is expected to start on April 11, shortly after Season 3 ends earlier that day.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">Lifeweaver is about to blossom 🌸 <br />Learn more tomorrow about the all new Support hero arriving in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Overwatch2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc^tfw">#Overwatch2</a> Season 4. <a href="https://t.co/T39o93Ekz6">pic.twitter.com/T39o93Ekz6</a></p>  — Overwatch (@PlayOverwatch) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1642958969978101775?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">April 3, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">While Blizzard has not confirmed it, Lifeweaver will likely be obtained the same way as the other new heroes in Overwatch 2.

Going by past characters' rollouts, Lifeweaver will also likely be unavailable in competitive matches for the first two weeks of the season.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-overwatch-2-hero-lifeweaver-has-been-revealed/1100-6512929/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## What's Fact And What's Fiction In Apple TV+'s Tetris Movie

<p dir="ltr">Tensions are high throughout Apple TV+'s Tetris, but all hell breaks loose in the movie's final moments. Henk Rogers (Taron Egerton) has just closed a major deal to distribute Tetris, and now has to leave Moscow ASAP before the KGB catches him. Throughout the film, the Russian security agency has had one goal in mind: to keep the rights for the video game developed by Alexey Pajitnov (Nikita Yefremov) within the Soviet Union. Since the dogged Rogers is on a mission to make Tetris a global hit--and will be that much closer to doing so when he boards a plane--the agents frantically pursue him in a nail-biting car chase.</p><p dir="ltr">Tetris is based on Rogers' real-life licensing of the video game, and the lasting friendship he built with Pajitnov along the way. Rogers, who is an executive producer on the project, said the trek to the airport was significantly condensed in the film. "It became much more exciting in the movie than it was real life," Rogers told GameSpot. But the Dutch game designer said the scene captured much of the emotions he and Pajitnov experienced. "We were very careful to make sure that the Soviet Union's accurately depicted," Rogers said. "If you can imagine going to North Korea today and trying to sneak into some ministry, I think that would put you in prison as a spy." The game designer said that was always in the back of his mind. "Alexey knew it was true, and we were taking big chances," he added.</p><p dir="ltr">Director Jon S. Baird recalled Rogers saying that Tetris "100% is true on an emotional level," and felt the line summarized the approach to the film. "He's basically saying we've represented his story and Alexey's journey correctly, but we've obviously had to add a bit of Hollywood in places," Baird said. He gave the example of the final climactic scene: "Certainly at the end, the rush to the airport, the car chase is a place where we did that."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/whats-fact-and-whats-fiction-in-apple-tvs-tetris-movie/1100-6512924/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Apex Legends Leaker Claims Single-Player Rumble LTM Is Legitimate

<p>A rumored Apex Legends LTM referred to as Rumble Royale (or Royal Rumble) by leakers and data miners is legitimate, according to Apex Legends leaker and data miner ThordanSmash, who confirmed the LTM's existence on Twitter over the weekend. The popular Apex content creator also voiced concern about the potential for game-breaking bugs being introduced alongside the new mode.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">Royal Rumble in Apex Legends is legit and my head is spinning on how its gonna release with no bugs.</p>  — Thordan Smash (@Thordansmash) <a href="https://twitter.com/Thordansmash/status/1641173507659780099?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">March 29, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">ThordanSmash has accurately leaked quite a bit of Apex Legends content in the past, including the existence of the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/apex-legends-all-sun-squad-collection-event-cosmetics-and-rewards/2900-4696/">Sun Squad Collection Event</a> legend skins. According to leaks, the new LTM is a solos-only mode where everything is randomized, from PvE encounters with wildlife to the map itself, though it's unclear exactly how the latter feature might be implemented. In addition to shedding the standard three-player squad, players will also be leaving legend abilities behind, forcing them to rely solely on their wits (and their ability to nail headshots) instead of their favorite legend's special skills.</p><p dir="ltr">This will certainly make the game more challenging--and more exciting--because although each legend's individual abilities will be inaccessible through traditional means, new consumable items in the loot pool will serve to replace them. Each consumable has its own benefits and drawbacks.

<p>World of Warcraft: Dragonflight's first major content patch is just under a month away, as Blizzard has <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/23934869/this-week-in-wow-april-3-2023">revealed</a> players will be able to dive into patch 10.1, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-dragonflight-embers-of-neltharion-update-will-take-players-deep-underground-to-discover-deathwings-secrets/1100-6512139/">Embers of Neltharion</a> starting on May 2. In addition to new content, the update will also add the ability, for the first time in nearly two decades, to join and create cross-faction guilds.</p><p dir="ltr">The update will introduce a massive new underground zone, the Zaralek Caverns, which players can organically travel to via several underground tunnels located throughout the Dragon Isles. A new faction players can earn renown with, the mole-like niffen, call the caverns home, and a new open-world activity, Fyrrak Assaults, will see players battling against the forces of the Primalists once more. The update will also introduce additional dragonriding glyphs for players to collect, new types of world quests, the continuation of the expansion's main storylines, and the aforementioned and highly-anticipated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-will-finally-allow-cross-faction-guilds-after-nearly-two-decades/1100-6512140/">arrival of cross-faction guilds</a>.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">The pain Deathwing inflicted was only the beginning.<br />Patch 10.1: Embers of Neltharion arrives May 2.<br />This week in WoW: <a href="https://t.co/cssIkawGUK">https://t.co/cssIkawGUK</a> <a href="https://t.co/N6NHGFadRj">pic.twitter.com/N6NHGFadRj</a></p>  — World of Warcraft (@Warcraft) <a href="https://twitter.com/Warcraft/status/1642937003242299392?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">April 3, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">On the endgame side of things, update 10.1 will also lead into the start of Dragonflight Season 2, which Blizzard confirmed will kick off the week of May 9. That's when the Normal, Heroic, and Mythic difficulties of the new Abberus, the Shadowed Crucible raid will be released. The raid, set in Neltharion's secret laboratory, looks to include plenty of throwbacks and references to older, Black Dragonflight-themed encounters, including vanilla's Blackwing Lair and Cataclysm's Blackwing Descent.

## The Last Of Us PC Port Deemed "Effectively A Beta" In New Technical Analysis

<p dir="ltr">The Last Of Us Part 1 came out on PC last week, and it didn't take long for fans to note the port's extensive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-1-pc-and-steam-deck-port-is-getting-torn-apart/1100-6512788/">technical problems</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-1-pc-port-glitch-includes-characters-being-wet-for-no-reason/1100-6512804/">strange glitches</a> in negative Steam reviews. Now, noted tech outlet Digital Foundry has released a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-the-last-of-us-part-1-on-pc-what-we-think-so-far">thorough analysis</a> of the port, calling it "effectively a beta" and one of the most disappointing port jobs in recent memory.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">The hour-long video analysis shows off the game running on three different machines, a PS5, a top-of-the-line PC with an RTX 4090, and a more modest setup with a RTX 2070 Super. Throughout the piece, Digital Foundry notes that the game's steep VRAM requirements effectively lock out many PC users entirely, with 8GB cards unable to deliver anything approaching a playable experience.</p><p dir="ltr">The Last Of Us Part 1 plays much better on a GPU with 10 or 11GB of VRAM, but its extremely high CPU requirements are also an issue, causing hitching and dropped frames on all but the most powerful PCs. The video also includes several bugs that players have reported, including missing lighting and an outright crash.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-pc-port-deemed-effectively-a-beta-in-new-technical-analysis/1100-6512921/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Star Wars Jedi: Survivor Final Preview

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-jedi-survivor/">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a>'s story takes place five years after the events of Fallen Order and is going in an interesting direction. Given embargo restrictions, I can't talk about what and who I specifically most enjoyed during my three-hour preview of the game, so you'll have to trust me that Survivor sets up some intriguing ideas and teases some potentially interesting character dynamics in its second chapter. Unfortunately, I was less impressed by a lot of what I <em>can </em>actually talk about and more by what I <em>can't</em>, but the sequel to one of my favorite Star Wars games is shaping up nicely.</p><p dir="ltr">In Survivor, you once again play as Cal Kestis, who finds himself struggling to keep ahead of the ever-expanding threat of the Galactic Empire, while also fighting against them. All these years later, the Empire is still expending efforts to hunt down and kill any Jedi who managed to survive Order 66, and Cal's exploits in Fallen Order have made him a key target. The preview I played picked up at the start of Survivor's second chapter, with Cal crashing the Mantis and setting out to find replacement parts for the ship. Greez, Cere, and Merrin aren't around, leaving Cal and his droid companion BD-1 to adventure alone.</p><p dir="ltr">I'll admit I haven't been all that excited for Survivor leading up to its release. In 2019, I was hungry for stories like Fallen Order, which was exploring a relatively untouched segment of the Star Wars timeline at the time. Beyond a handful of stories like Star Wars: Rebels and Star Wars: Darth Vader, the post-Clone Wars era was still a largely unknown period in Disney's Star Wars canon. That's no longer the case in 2023, with Bad Batch, Andor, Tales of the Jedi, and Obi-Wan having further expanded on the era and the various factions struggling for survival under the Empire's shadow. So seeing Survivor, yet <em>another </em>story set during this period, wasn't all that exciting.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-survivor-final-preview/1100-6512918/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

That facility is set to be completed in 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">Over the past two years, Konami has indicated that it intends to return to the core game industry in a major way after moving away from AAA games production in the mid-2010s.

<p>Chris Evans has stated that he has no immediate plans to return to the role of Steve Rogers, aka Captain America, in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Evans made the statement at the C2E2 fan convention in Chicago, and <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/chris-evans-captain-america-return-more-steve-rogers-stories-1235571651/">Variety</a> was first to report.</p><p dir="ltr">"He means so much to me," Evans said. "I think there's more Steve Rogers stories to tell, sure. But at the same time, I'm very, very precious with it… it's like this little shiny thing that I have that I love so much, and I just don't want to mess up in any way, and I was a part of something that was so special for the special period of time and in a way, it really landed so well." Evans added, "As much as I'm connected to that role and love telling those stories and working with those people, it doesn't quite feel right right now."</p><p dir="ltr">Evans had portrayed the character for eight years, starting with Captain America: The First Avenger in 2011 and ending with Avengers: Endgame in 2019. In Avengers: Endgame, Evans' character passes the Captain America shield to Anthony Mackie's Sam Wilson/Falcon. The Disney+ series The Falcon and the Winter Soldier then explored Sam's journey to becoming the new Captain America. The upcoming Marvel film Captain America: New World Order will feature Mackie as the new Captain America.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/chris-evans-thinks-there-are-more-steve-rogers-stories-to-tell-but-now-isnt-the-time/1100-6512913/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Star Wars Jedi: Survivor Uses The PS5 DualSense Controller To Make You Feel The Force

<p>Unlike the first game in the series, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor won't be arriving on PS4 and Xbox One when it launches later in April. The benefit to Respawn's Star Wars sequel targeting current-gen systems for launch is that the game will have quicker loading times and improved visuals, and on PS5, more nuanced Force powers to use thanks to the DualSense controller.</p><p>"With the PS5, we’re really digging the haptics and what the controller is bringing, and it's been a lot of fun to see how that works with push and pull [Force powers]," said game director Stig Asmussen in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/04/03/star-wars-jedi-survivor-hands-on-gameplay-report-a-sequel-with-galactic-improvements/">PS Blog interview</a>. "And a [DualSense] controller, it feels really good, and we're taking advantage of that. You're going to feel it on the triggers when you're doing push and pull. If you really [push] on the triggers, it's going to give a different response. Compared to if you’re lightly feathering them, and the game is going to react to that. It's the nuance within the vibrations on the controller that is pretty outstanding."</p><p>Asmussen added that the Respawn audio and combat teams "really dialed into how the things that are happening in the world" would affect the player, leading to the developers translating those effects into haptics that will be delivered through the controller's internal hardware. Another advantage that players will see when they play on PS5 is a vastly improved draw distance, as Asmussen said that the game has been optimized for that console. Players will be able to structures, creatures, and enemies in the distance, all of which are rendered in real-time and in high detail regardless of distance.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-survivor-uses-the-ps5-dualsense-controller-to-make-you-feel-the-force/1100-6512908/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>DC teased the first Blue Beetle trailer over the weekend and it delivered its newest induction into the DC Universe: Jamie Reyes, the Blue Beetle. The first trailer for Blue Beetle gives you the initial look at Xolo Maridueña (Netflix's Cobra Kai) as Jamie and his encounter with the alien scarab, Khaji Da.</p><p>The first trailer gives you glimpses of Jamie's life before encountering a piece of alien technology, a tight family group, and shadowy figures lurking within the world of Big Tech who want the Scarab for themselves. The cast also includes comedian George Lopez as Jaime's uncle Rudy, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/susan-sarandon-joins-blue-beetle-cast-as-victoria-kord-report/1100-6502514/">Susan Sarandon</a> (Thelma and Louise) as Victoria Kord, Raoul Trujillo (Apocalypto) as the villainous Carapax, and Harvey Guillén (FX's What We Do In The Shadows) in an unspecified role. Check it out below.</p><div>          </div><p>Jamie is the third person to take on the Blue Beetle mantle following Dan Garrett and Ted Kord, with the latter being possibly the most synonymous with the name. There's even a brief look at Ted's Bug flying through the air in the footage. Both Garrett and Kord were creations of Spider-Man co-creator Steve Ditko. Jamie was created by comic book legends Keith Giffen, John Rogers, and Cully Hamner in 2006 during DC's Infinite Crisis event.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blue-beetle-trailer-takes-xolo-mariduena-to-new-heights-as-dcu-hero/1100-6512909/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Asus announced it is making a Steam Deck handheld competitor called ROG Ally. Preorders will be available for it soon.</p><p>The handheld will run a custom chip from AMD inside and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLZxyv79Oo">YouTuber Dave2D suggests</a> that it utilizes a Zen 4 + RDNA 3 APU. The price and availability haven't been revealed, though. <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/159047/614286/10014?u=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/asus/learn-about-rog-ally/pcmcat1678398541884.c&amp;subid1=gs-gs{{TYPE_ID}}{{CONTENT_ID}}-dtp-en">Best Buy has a listing</a> up for it, but no preorder option just yet. ROG Ally looks somewhat similar to the Steam Deck but has some differences, most notably the color.

ROG Ally is compatible with multiple platforms, including Windows 11 and Xbox Game Pass.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/asus-is-making-a-steam-deck-competitor-preorders-live-soon/1100-6512907/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Counter-Strike Players Reportedly Spent $100 Million In Cases In March

<p dir="ltr">It's no secret that Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the most popular game on Steam, but the sheer volume of money that fans spend on it is difficult to comprehend. According to a new estimate from <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/csgo/players-reportedly-spent-100-million-on-csgo-cases-last-month-2102744/">Dexerto</a>, Counter-Strike players spent over $100 million on cases in March 2023.</p><p dir="ltr">The outlet arrived at this figure using data from <a href="https://csgocasetracker.com/blog/Case-Unboxing-Report-March-2023">CS:GO Case Tracker</a>, which stated that players opened 39.5 million cases in March. Cases range in cost from under $1 to over $60, and each requires a $2.50 key to open. Given all that, just over $100 million is a conservative estimate, to say the least. For comparison's sake, that same data suggests that players opened 27.7 million cases in February, which would make for a 42.5% increase month-to-month.</p><p dir="ltr">Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has had the top spot on the Steam player charts for years, but the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/counter-strike-2-is-legit-coming-just-round-the-corner-report/1100-6512065/">surprise announcement</a> of Counter-Strike 2 has brought its popularity to new heights. Described as a total overhaul of the game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/counter-strike-2-confirmed-for-summer-2023-release-limited-test-begins-today/1100-6512606/">Counter-Strike 2</a> will be a free upgrade to Global Offensive, with all items transferring over. Confirmed changes include higher server tick rates, improved smoke grenades, and better visuals. It's set for a Summer 2023 release.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/counter-strike-players-reportedly-spent-100-million-in-cases-in-march/1100-6512904/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Drifting Joy-Cons have been the bane of many a Switch players' existence for years now. If you're located in Europe, we have good news--Nintendo will now repair broken or faulty Joy-Cons for free in a large number of countries in that region, even if your Joy-Cons are out of warranty.</p><p dir="ltr">As explained by the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Support/Nintendo-Switch/Troubleshooting/Joy-Con-Control-Sticks-Are-Not-Responding-or-Respond-Incorrectly-responsiveness-syndrome-or-so-called-drifting--1908347.html">Nintendo UK support page</a>, Nintendo will no longer charge customers in the European Economic Area, the UK, or Switzerland to repair the "responsiveness syndrome," i.e. Joy-Con drift. However, the announcement notes that Joy-Con damage caused by unofficial mods or consumer tampering will not be covered by this policy. It also states that Nintendo's warranty "does not affect any statutory rights which you may have under consumer protection legislation as the purchaser of goods."</p><p dir="ltr">Joy-Con drift has been a major problem for Switch players since the console's original release, especially for players who tend to play only in undocked mode.

<p>Netflix has released the first trailer for Extraction 2, showing Chris Hemsworth returning as Tyler Rake to once again rescue hostages in a very inhospitable environment.</p><p>At the end of 2020's Extraction, Rake completed his mission to save a young boy and seemingly died. But somehow he survived, and in the sequel, he's tasked with saving yet another prisoner. This time, the Australian mercenary is hired to rescue the family of a Georgian gangster from a prison. A <em>lot </em>of action will ensue, based on this first trailer, including a high-stakes mission on a train where Rake stands on the train and uses a minigun to down a helicopter in the snow. The trailer also fills in some gaps that help explain how Rake managed to survive the events of the first movie.</p><div>          </div><p>The original Extraction <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/extraction-is-set-to-be-biggest-netflix-movie-prem/1100-6476766/">broke Netflix viewership records</a>, and while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/netflixs-extraction-review-maximum-action-minimum-/1900-6417454/">the story left something to be desired</a>, the action sequences were memorable, including an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflixs-extraction-watch-chris-hemsworth-movie-di/1100-6476564/">11-minute one-shot with the director strapping himself to the front of car, putting himself very much in danger</a>, to get the shot.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/extraction-2-trailer-see-chris-hemsworth-shoot-down-a-helicopter-with-a-minigun-on-a-train/1100-6512901/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## MLB The Show 23 Review - Grand Slam

<p dir="ltr">Jackie Robinson is many things: a hall of fame baseball player; a Rookie of the Year, MVP, and World Series winner; and, most notably, the first Black man to break baseball's color line and compete in the Major Leagues. The legendary number 42 made his Brooklyn Dodgers debut in 1947 and lit up the diamond with his electric playstyle, all while facing intolerance and hatred from fans, opposing players, and teammates alike. Jackie Robinson's alluring talent was one of the reasons he was chosen to be the first Negro League player to integrate into the previously segregated Major Leagues, but it was his outstanding intangibles--such as his ability to handle racist abuse with grace--that sealed the deal. Bob Kendrick, president of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, will tell you that Jackie Robinson wasn't the greatest player to ply his trade in the Negro Leagues. That's not to disparage one of the greatest players of all time, but to provide context for just how good some of the league's other players were.</p><p dir="ltr">MLB The Show 23 shines a spotlight on these unknown and forgotten heroes of the Negro Leagues. A new Storylines mode explores the league's rich history, telling a captivating story of extraordinary people triumphing in the face of abhorrent prejudice and hate. It's a landmark moment for sports games--and video games in general--meshing The Show's consistently excellent gameplay with educational and inspiring video packages narrated by the extremely knowledgeable Kendrick himself. The rest of the game iterates on its predecessors and shakes up the Diamond Dynasty formula with some major changes, but it's Storylines: The Negro Leagues that stands out above all else and elevates the entire experience.</p><p dir="ltr">Eight players are featured in this interactive learning tool: Leroy "Satchel" Page, Hilton Smith, Andrew "Rube" Foster, Hank Thompson, John Jordan "Buck" O'Neil, Jackie Robinson, John Donaldson, and Martin Dihigo. You may have only heard of one or two of these players, but every legendary figure has a whole series dedicated to their life and career, with each one spanning between eight and nine episodes.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mlb-the-show-23-review-grand-slam/1900-6418050/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Xbox Game Pass is losing an exclusive game soon, as Quantum Break is listed in the "Leaving Soon" section of the Game Pass app alongside six other titles that are set for removal. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-console-exclusive-quantum-break-is-leaving-xbox-game-pass">Eurogamer spotted the listing</a>, and GameSpot has seen it as well.</p><p>Games get removed from the Game Pass library on a regular schedule, but Quantum Break's upcoming removal is noteworthy because it's a console exclusive Xbox game. Developed by Alan Wake studio Remedy, the game was released in 2016 at a time when Microsoft was pushing into the area of TV programming.</p><p>The game, which features actors Shawn Ashmore, Aiden Gillan, Dominic Monaghan, and the late Lance Reddick, featured both gameplay and live-action sequences. It's not the Xbox exclusive game to leave Game Pass, though, as Microsoft has removed Forza titles previously. However, those titles were removed due to music licensing reasons. Exactly why Quantum Break is getting cut is unclear.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-is-losing-its-own-exclusive-quantum-break-soon/1100-6512899/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## The Super Mario Bros. Movie First Reactions: Entertaining But Formulaic Family Fun

<p>Ahead of its release later this month, the social media embargo has lifted for The Super Mario Bros. Movie, and as expected, Illumination's adaptation of the beloved Nintendo IP is winning many critics over. A combination of family-friendly storytelling, slick visuals, slick animation, and a (mostly) solid cast of celebrity voice actors is proving to be a strong combination, and for longtime fans of the franchise, there's no shortage of Easter eggs either.</p><p>Most of the positive buzz describes the film as a love letter to the entire Mario series, and several critics have noted that composer Brian Tyler has crafted a powerful score for the film. Illumination's animation has also been praised, and the Mario brothers have great--but brief--chemistry with each other as they find themselves transported to the Mushroom Kingdom. For the cast, Jack Black's Bowser and Charlie Day's Luigi are the highlight of the film according to critics, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/chris-pratt-reacts-to-backlash-about-him-voicing-mario-in-the-upcoming-film/1100-6512822/">Chris Pratt gives a solid</a>--but not remarkable--performance as Mario. Overall, you can <em>probably </em>expect this Mario movie to be better than the 1993 film.</p><p>While the red carpet premiere had plenty of positive things to say about the film, a few other critics pointed out some of the weaker aspects of the movie. A kids film at heart, don't expect a complex plot as this movie aims to be a crowd-pleasing adaptation. Expect a formulaic story, one that plays to Illumination's crowd-pleasing strengths.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-super-mario-bros-movie-first-reactions-entertaining-but-formulaic-family-fun/1100-6512898/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Major changes are afoot for the dinosaur game franchise Ark. Developer Studio Wildcard has <a href="https://survivetheark.com/index.php?/articles.html/community-crunch-355-ark-roadmap-evo-event-and-more-r2075/">announced</a> that the sequel, Ark 2, has been delayed to 2024 and the original game's official servers are shutting down soon. The third major announcement was a new version of the original Ark, called Ark Survival Ascend, which will take the place of the original Ark and looks to deliver a number of meaningful-sounding improvements.</p><p>Starting with the delay, Ark 2--which features the actor Vin Diesel--is now scheduled to launch at the end of 2024 on PC, Xbox, and Game Pass. It was previously set to be released sometime in 2023. Explaining the delay, Studio Wildcard said the pushback was in the best interest of the game and the development team.</p><p>"This news will be disappointing to many--we feel it too--but we're confident this heavy decision is the right one," the studio explained.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ark-2-delayed-to-2024-but-a-new-unreal-engine-5-version-of-original-game-is-coming-soon/1100-6512897/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
