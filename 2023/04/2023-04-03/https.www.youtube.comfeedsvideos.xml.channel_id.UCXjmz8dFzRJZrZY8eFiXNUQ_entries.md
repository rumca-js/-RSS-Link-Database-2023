Mad Max: Fury Road is one of the most adrenaline fueled action movies to come out in the last 10 years.   With it's emphasis on practical stunts, immersive cinematography,  and next level production design, Mad Max would push cinema to new heights.  Aside from our heroes, Immortan Joe stole the show.  Immortan Joe is a villain that stands above many in the genre, and provides a grim out look on the landscape of Mad Max.
