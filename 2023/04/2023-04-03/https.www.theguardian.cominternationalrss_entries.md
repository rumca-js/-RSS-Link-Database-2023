## José Luis Mendilibar, the fixer setting Sevilla on straight path towards safety | Sid Lowe

<p>The old-school, straight-talking coach is not a typical Sevilla manager but he offers a simplicity that is badly needed</p><p>José Luis Mendilibar can’t be bothered with the bullshit. Enjoyably potty-mouthed, as direct in the press room as on the pitch, he is, he says, the anti-modern football manager. He tells it the way it is, challenges fools and takes on authority, doesn’t like VAR – a circus, he calls it – and definitely doesn’t like the theatre, insisting: “we’re a bunch of cheats in La Liga; touch us and it’s like someone killed us.” He doesn’t have an iPad, doesn’t think much of the stats and doesn’t mind saying so. He reckons too many training grounds look like airports – cones and arrows and God-knows-what all over the place – and too many coaches hang around there all day to make a point, not a difference.</p><p>As for him, he never wanted to be a manager at all but once he started with tiny CD Arratia in 1994, he couldn’t stop, not one season going by without him working. This was all set to be the first in almost 30 years, the last 14 of those in the top division, until a call came from the dressing room at the Coliseum, around the time the <em>clásico</em> was kicking off a fortnight ago. Sevilla had just been beaten in Getafe, their third defeat in four games in which 12 goals were conceded. Only two points above relegation, their coach had lost control and, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/mar/06/sevilla-dragged-back-into-la-ligas-sarlacc-pit-after-atletico-annihilation">desperate now</a>, the sporting director Monchi needed someone to save them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/03/jose-luis-mendilibar-sevilla-la-liga-blog">Continue reading...</a>

## A whale: sleeping vertically, they look as though they could stop time | Helen Sullivan

<p>Blood rushes through its veins and the whale’s enormous body shakes slightly</p><p>Blue whales are the largest animal ever to have lived – including the dinosaurs – which also makes them the largest animal ever to have slept. All that sleep! A whole whale’s worth, in vast, cold water, the ocean a closed eye, salty and dark. To watch a whale sleeping is to feel as though they have turned the world around them into sleep, that they are suspended in sleep itself, in the liquid that fills your bones when you turn off the light.</p><p>Sperm whales sleep vertically, in groups, suspended impossibly, the way an object might be suspended only in a dream. They look like planets, their orbit suddenly stopped. They look as if they could stop time. And maybe they would, if they ever slept for longer than 20 minutes, or closed both eyes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/commentisfree/2023/apr/04/a-whale-sleeping-vertically-they-look-like-they-could-stop-time">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Andrew Legg’s film, shot on 16mm, tells the story of two women who have invented a machine that intercepts future television broadcasts</p><p>A clever riff on the time-travel genre, Andrew Legge’s small but mighty feature debut begins with a title card announcing the discovery of a mysterious cache of film reels in the 1940s. The grainy and jagged black-and-white footage, shot on a 16mm Bolex, turns out to be home movies made by Martha (Stefanie Martini) and Thomasina (Emma Appleton), two orphaned sisters who have devised a machine that can intercept broadcast signals from the future, and which they have named after their deceased mother.</p><p>The film impresses with its imaginative design: a circular monitor is affixed to a towering metal rig, suggesting a television screen as well as a fortune teller’s crystal globe. Glowing with prescient images – such as a video of David Bowie singing Space Oddity – this fantastical creation empowers the young women both spiritually and financially. When not grooving to 1960s rock, the pair make money off betting on horses. As the second world war rages on, the sisters also use the machine to inform the British army of the enemy’s upcoming attacks, a well-intentioned decision that leads to devastating consequences.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/03/lola-review-imaginative-design-and-endearing-main-characters-make-up-for-uncertain-plot">Continue reading...</a>

<p>We need governments to step up and make housing more affordable. But in the meantime, it’s possible to rethink how we organise family and social life</p><p>The crisis of homelessness and housing insecurity isn’t new. But there is every sign it is becoming more entrenched in Australia. It’s going to take a whole range of government and society-led changes to get ourselves out of this mess, but I am convinced it is also going to take some rethinking about how we structure our homes and households. One option is to find ways to long-term cohabitate.</p><p>When I arrived in Melbourne in the mid-2000s via enrolment in a certificate of youth work, I was connected with people who were sleeping rough on the streets and those who were temporarily sheltering in dilapidated boarding houses dotted across the city. The disturbing conditions and scale of homelessness made a profound impression on my rurally raised psyche. Eight years later I worked another job assisting with applications for crisis housing, simultaneously handing out sleeping bags and a set of fresh socks – sending people back out to the street while they waited for a crisis bed, never knowing if it would be a day or a week, or never.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/03/my-partner-and-i-bought-a-house-with-two-friends-can-cohabiting-reduce-the-burden-of-australias-housing-crisis">Continue reading...</a>
