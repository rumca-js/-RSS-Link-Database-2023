With nothing but $250-plus motherboard options, the $300 Ryzen 5 7600X just didn&rsquo;t make financial sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After AMD&rsquo;s assurances<strong> </strong>of $125 AM5 motherboards at CES 2023, boards below $150 have slowly begun making one-off appearances. But in general, AM5 starts at a tangibly higher price than AM4 boards ever did. That&rsquo;s beginning to change (for real this time), with last week&rsquo;s first batch of A620 chipset motherboards quietly hitting shelves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I spotted this weekend on Newegg (purely by accident), you can already make your choice between <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/p/pl?d=a620&amp;xcust=2-3-1681282-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">two ASRock micro-ATX models</a>. The ASRock A620M-HDV/M.2 is priced at $85 for chips up to 65W (i.e., the Ryzen 5 7600, Ryzen 7 7700, and Ryzen 9 7900), while the ASRock A620M-HDV/M.2+ is $100 and supports chips up to 120W (i.e., Ryzen 5 7600X, Ryzen 7 7700X, Ryzen 7 7800X3D, Ryzen 9 7900X3D, and <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1524570/amd-ryzen-9-7950x3d-review-v-cache.html\">Ryzen 9 7950X3D</a>). But other board vendors will soon be jumping into the fray&mdash;last Friday Asus announced two boards of its own in a press release, the TUF A620M Gaming Plus Wi-Fi and Prime A620M Plus.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1681291\" height=\"669\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/newegg-a620.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Well, what do we have here? Looks like two A620 options from ASRock.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>These boards seem to share some common features, like just one x16 PCIe 4.0 slot and a small handful of SATA ports. Compared to B650, the initial entry-level AM5 motherboard chipset, A620 seems to lack on-board PCIe lanes for M.2 slots, though it still supports DDR5 memory like other AM5 boards. The number of USB ports on these initial A620 motherboards varies, as does the number of RAM slots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the prices of DDR5 RAM now plummeting, it seems like building a mid-tier PC with Ryzen 7000 may be more feasible after all. Keep an eye out for bundle deals still, though&mdash;we spotted <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://slickdeals.net/newsearch.php?q=newegg+combo+deal+ryzen+7000&amp;xcust=2-3-1681282-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">a few stunning combos in early March</a>.

Unfortunately for Western Digital, the transition from spinning hard drives to SSDs affected the company&rsquo;s business over the past few years, and the current downturn in the PC market didn&rsquo;t help. SSD prices have also fallen. That has shifted revenue to WD&rsquo;s cloud services like MyCloud. In January, WD said that cloud services represented 39 percent of total revenue, which fell 36 percent from a year ago. (Cloud revenues fell the same amount.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, it doesn&rsquo;t look like WD&rsquo;s books will benefit from this, either. &ldquo;While Western Digital is focused on remediating this security incident, it has caused and may continue to cause disruption to parts of the Company&rsquo;s business operations,&rdquo; it said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When will My Cloud be back online? WD hasn&rsquo;t said, but the future still looks very uncertain at the moment. On one hand, WD says that &ldquo;as part of its remediation efforts, Western Digital is actively working to restore impacted infrastructure and services.&rdquo; On the other, the company says it still plans to &ldquo;take additional steps where appropriate.&rdquo; To us, that sounds like a very formal, very official approximation of: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have any idea what&rsquo;s going on right now, but we&rsquo;re doing our best.&rdquo; </p>\n\nStorage</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1681254/western-digitals-my-cloud-goes-down-after-hack.html", "date_published": "2023-04-03 19:50:50+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Privacy browser from Mullvad VPN and Tor tries to erase your digital fingerprint", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a lot of browsers out there that claim to be all about security. The latest is a team-up from the Tor Project and the makers of Mullvad VPN. The Mullvad Browser (which is different from the Tor Browser, also very much a thing) is focused on your &ldquo;digital fingerprint,&rdquo; or rather, it&rsquo;s focused on trying to make that disappear. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While a conventional VPN can hide your IP address and make it appear that you&rsquo;re connecting through a different server, and the Tor network does something similar with its distributed &ldquo;onion&rdquo; routing, advertisers have created much more complex means of tracking web users both individually and in groups. This goes far beyond cookie files: A combination of browser agent, language, plugins, even browser permissions and installed fonts can help identify you to a potential advertiser, and track your activity all across the web. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Mullvad browser does its best to obfuscate this information. It doesn&rsquo;t report back to the developer for performance information. It takes out some of the most common web APIs. It changes the dimensions of the reported web page to keep your screen resolution hidden. Yes, it even restricts the available number of fonts. While the browser doesn&rsquo;t actually use the Tor network, it was developed in conjunction with the Tor team, with the aim of using a conventional VPN service for security instead.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combined with other precautions, like using the Mullvad VPN (which is also <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/406870/best-vpn-services-apps-reviews-buying-advice.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">our pick for the best privacy VPN service of 2023</a>!) and built-in ad blocking with uBlock Origin, the aim is to make a browser as airtight and privacy-focused as possible. While the Mullvad VPN is a paid service, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://mullvad.net/en/download/browser/&amp;xcust=2-1-1681126-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">the browser is a free download</a> for Windows, Mac, and Linux. </p>\n\nSecurity</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1681126/privacy-browser-from-mullvad-vpn-and-tor-tries-to-erase-your-digital-fingerprint.html", "date_published": "2023-04-03 18:33:35+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Watch how ChatGPT is tricked into generating Windows 95 keys", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>ChatGPT and other AI chatbots seem a little bit like magic sometimes. But they&rsquo;re not, especially when asked to do a fairly basic computational task that you&rsquo;d think they could handle with relative ease&mdash;like generate a Windows 95 license key.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From our <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1671133/chatgpt-vs-bing-vs-bard-whats-the-best-ai-chatbot.html\">AI shootout of ChatGPT versus Microsoft Bing versus Google Bard</a>, we know that AI chatbots can outperform our expectations on some tasks, and surprisingly struggle with others. Enderman, a YouTuber who typically plays around with various older Windows builds, set out to see if they could generate a brand-new Windows 95 key. (This is probably illegal, but anyway&hellip;)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The obvious method is to simply ask ChatGPT to generate the requisite license keys, but OpenAI made its chatbot too ethical for that. So an alternative was necessary. As Enderman points out, Windows 95 key generation uses a known algorithm, combining various strings of numbers and letters together in a known way to create the 20-character code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The method doesn&rsquo;t appear to be all that complicated&mdash;three random characters, a year string, the letters &ldquo;OEM,&rdquo; and so on. The trouble, however, is simply explaining that to ChatGPT in a way that it understands, and in a way that the algorithm won&rsquo;t generate bugs in return. You can see how Enderman fared in the video below (spoiler: he does succeed) but it&rsquo;s worth slowing down or even pausing the video to examine the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>ChatGPT&rsquo;s struggles underscore several points: first, the AI chatbot is a large language model, which means that it was designed to parse natural <em>language</em> and output a result. As our shootout revealed, AI chatbots still can&rsquo;t always get this right, either because the input was poor, or the algorithm simply didn&rsquo;t understand it correctly. We might tolerate some inprecision in how an AI chatbot explains the causes of the American Revolution, but generating a license key is similar to a math problem: the answer is either correct, or it isn&rsquo;t. Perhaps oddly, this isn&rsquo;t always an AI&rsquo;s strong suit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What you might take away from all of this is what some are realizing: AIs benefit from clear, precise language inputs. If you&rsquo;re a lawyer, writer, historian, or some other arts major who practices their communication skills regularly, this brave new world of AI chatbots may benefit you. Some are even adding &ldquo;prompt engineer&rdquo; to their resumes&mdash;and why not, when the ability to issue clear directions might up their value substantially? This YouTuber discovered this the hard way. But since the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1424575/chatgpt-is-the-future-of-ai-chatbots.html\">basic version of ChatGPT is free to use</a>, why not give it a whirl yourself?</p>\n\nInternet</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1681090/watch-how-chatgpt-is-tricked-into-generating-windows-95-keys.html", "date_published": "2023-04-03 17:57:35+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Asus takes on the Steam Deck with new ROG Ally handheld", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>It looks like the big PC gaming brands are tired of leaving Steam Deck competition to the likes of smaller companies like AyaNeo or GPD. On April 1st Asus announced its first handheld gaming PC, the ROG Ally, an AMD-based setup that looks remarkably familiar. Yes, this is a real product, and it&rsquo;s really coming out &mdash; there&rsquo;s a Best Buy retail page already, and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/ASUS_ROG/status/1642882143193010176&amp;xcust=2-1-1680929-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Asus said that it&rsquo;s real on Twitter</a>, so the universal law of no-take-backs is in effect. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The ROG Ally is built on an AMD APU like the Steam Deck, but it&rsquo;s running Windows out of the box, giving it access to a wider band of games without the need for a Linux-based compatibility layer. Details on the hardware are sparse, but Asus claims that the APU is custom (&ldquo;the fastest AMD APU yet&rdquo;), the cooling uses dual fans, and the screen is full HD resolution that works well under direct lighting. The video shows off RGB lighting around the analog sticks and on a rear strip, and while it lacks the Steam Deck&rsquo;s touch-sensitive pads, it does have rear handle buttons. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asus is bringing an X-factor to the design: external graphics. <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/629083/asus-flow-z13-review-an-even-more-modular-gaming-tablet.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Like the Flow series of gaming laptops</a>, the ROG Ally can work with a proprietary external GPU dock, giving its AMD-based hardware an injection of discrete graphics card <em>powah. </em>The dock also charges the Ally and enables external displays, making local multiplayer with wireless controllers easy. It isn&rsquo;t clear if this is the same dock used by the latest Flow laptops, which is available with <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1667601/this-asus-dock-will-give-a-tiny-laptop-rtx-4090-powers-for-a-high-price.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">up to a mobile GeForce RTX 4090 GPU</a>, but it seems like the same unit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Specific release info, including a price and date, is not available.

You can find better rivals for just a few dollars more, but if you&rsquo;ve got an extremely tight budget, these will do well enough for movies, music, and calls.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Run a search for computer speakers under $20, and you&rsquo;ll find plenty of options&mdash;but not many will give you much bang for your buck. A rare exception is the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407934/creative-pebble-review-impressively-big-sound-from-teeny-25-speakers.html\">Creative Pebble</a>, one of our current top picks for budget PC speakers, but most cheap speakers are unremarkable offerings tied to unknown brands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Cyber Acoustics keeps steadily producing extremely affordable, if basic, speakers. You won&rsquo;t brag about to friends about buying a set, but they perform well for their price. The USB variant of the company&rsquo;s CA-2014 model continues on in this mold, though depending on your tastes, you may find a couple of its features off-putting.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>Note: See our roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407990/the-best-budget-computer-speakers.html\">best budget computer speakers</a> to learn about competing products, what to look for in budget speakers, and buying recommendations.</em></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"cyber-acoustics-ca-2014usb-specs-and-audio-quality\">Cyber Acoustics CA-2014USB: Specs and audio quality</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Priced at $15, the Cyber Acoustics CA-2014USB connects over USB (as you might guess from its name), rather than the 3.5mm aux cable that the original CA-2014 used.

The two speakers are hardwired to one another, so to get started, simply plug the also-hardwired USB cable into your PC. Afterward, you can easily position them discreetly on the sides of a monitor or have them flank your laptop&mdash;these speakers take minimal space, measuring just 6.87 (H) x 2.62 (W) x 2.25 (D) inches (174.5 x 66.5 x 57.2 mm).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you&rsquo;re connected, the stereo audio you get is clear and neutral, with clean reproduction of high-frequency sounds like cymbals. You get little bass, though. Like the other Cyber Acoustic product I&rsquo;ve tested so far, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/628046/cyber-acoustic-ca-2890-speaker-bar-review-surprisingly-good-despite-its-limitations.html\">the company&rsquo;s CA-2890 speaker bar</a>, the CA-2014USB doesn&rsquo;t produce much in the way of low-end frequencies. If you desire more warmth from your PC speakers, look elsewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Once you&rsquo;re connected, the stereo audio you get is clear and neutral, with clean reproduction of high-frequency sounds like cymbals.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this tuning means that the CA-2014USB provides crisp audio at most volumes&mdash;and these speakers can pump out decibels. Cyber Acoustics touts them as having &ldquo;surprisingly loud sound,&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s true&mdash;they can blast an astonishing amount of volume. That&rsquo;s so even if you don&rsquo;t push all the way to the max (which you should avoid, since the CA-2014USB distorts at the highest part of its range). On our test PC, I got decent sound quality until about the 90 percent mark.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"cyber-acoustics-ca-2014usb-controls\">Cyber Acoustics CA-2014USB: Controls</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The more divisive aspect of these speakers are the controls, rather than the sound. Unlike the original CA-2014, this USB version replaces the volume knob with a set of buttons. You&rsquo;ll have to get your hand around the back of the speaker (or even go to two hands) to successfully press the volume buttons. The same maneuver applies when clicking the mute button, too. Each click of the volume buttons move Windows&rsquo; volume percentage up or down by 2 percent increments, and you can hold them down for bigger, faster changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"should-you-buy-the-cyber-acoustics-ca-2014usb\">Should you buy the Cyber Acoustics CA-2014USB?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The CA-2014USB won&rsquo;t knock anyone&rsquo;s socks off, but for $15, they work well as clear, louder versions of laptop speakers&mdash;or a set of ultra-affordable, basic speakers for a desktop PC. Are there better-sounding rivals? Yes, for another $5, you could get the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://us.creative.com/p/speakers/creative-pebble&amp;xcust=2-1-1671212-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Creative Pebble</a> instead. But if you&rsquo;d rather save that money, the CA-2014USB will do a decent job when you watch videos or make calls. Music&rsquo;s fine, too, but songs just won&rsquo;t sound as pleasant as they could.</p>\n\nSpeakers</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1671212/cyber-acoustics-ca-2014usb-speaker-review.html", "date_published": "2023-04-03 14:30:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "How to check your PC\u2019s CPU temperature", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Is your computer&rsquo;s CPU too hot?

Consider cleaning the dust out of your PC if CPU temperatures continue to creep up over time.</li><li><strong>70&deg; C to 80&deg; C</strong>: This is hotter than you want to run unless you&rsquo;re pushing an overclock. If you&rsquo;re not, definitely check to make sure your fans are working and there aren&rsquo;t dust bunnies clogging up your system&rsquo;s airflow.</li><li><strong>80&deg; C to 90&deg; C</strong>: Now we&rsquo;re getting too hot for long-term comfort. Check your hardware for broken fans or dust build-up, and if you&rsquo;re overclocking, dial back your settings&mdash;especially the voltage if you&rsquo;ve tweaked it. One notable exception: We sometimes see more powerful laptop processors hit the low 80s during gaming sessions when plugged in, at which point they start throttling back performance. This is expected, but if temperatures cross 85&deg; C, be concerned.</li><li><strong>Over 90&deg; C</strong>: Danger, Will Robinson!</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-lower-your-cpu-temperatures\">How to lower your CPU temperatures</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re regularly encountering high CPU temperatures, there are some steps you can take to try and fix the issue.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"clean pc\" src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/02/clean-pc-100748691-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70\" /><figcaption>\n<p>Roll up your sleeves.</p>\n</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>First, clean out your PC.

Local hardware stores usually charge outrageous prices for canned air, but you can pick up a bottle for about <a class=\"product-link\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/product/B0000AE67M&amp;xcust=2-1-407914-1-392360-16799&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$8 on Amazon</a>.

If not, more intensive steps are in order. The thermal paste that transfers heat from your CPU to its cooler might have dried out if you&rsquo;ve had your PC for a few years.

Windows 10 began by only allowing you to snap windows to the four corners of the screen. On an ultrawide, that looks and feels odd. But in Windows 11, Snap Assist or the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/830006/my-favorite-feature-in-windows-11-22h2-is.html\">Snap Bar</a> makes an <em>enormous</em> difference.

The 34-inch offers 341 nits max brightness and a contrast ratio of about 3,090:1. The display is rated at a 96 percent coverage of the DCI-P3 color gamut, but we only recorded 88 percent, so some tweaking will be needed. The display rates 128 percent of the sRGB color gamut. It includes some pretty mediocre speakers, though they&rsquo;re there. The display includes some awesome extra features, however.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because my desk is narrow, I don&rsquo;t even take full advantage of the built-in KVM option the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Jlink-Computer-Monitor-FreeSync-Multitasking/dp/B0B58X8HFW/&amp;xcust=2-1-1673092-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jlink D34QR4K</a> includes, where you can divide up the screen between two inputs&mdash;like two laptops, or a desktop and a gaming console&mdash;or even go Picture in Picture. (Remember that?) You&rsquo;ll need to connect them via the included ports: two HDMI ports, a DisplayPort, and a DisplayPort over USB-C connection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also supports AMD&rsquo;s FreeSync Premium adaptive sync technology for enhanced gaming smoothness. And <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1439692/best-ultrawide-gaming-monitors.html\">ultrawide displays rock for gaming</a>! If your chosen games supports widescreen resolutions, you&rsquo;ll have even more screen space for the interface, tracking enemies, seeing the map, and so forth. Jlink&rsquo;s display tries to target both productivity and gaming, but I&rsquo;m more in love with the work aspects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bottom line, though, is that I&rsquo;ll never look at a widescreen as just a silly option I&rsquo;ll never take advantage of. I&rsquo;ll have to go back to standard display eventually, but I&rsquo;ll miss that extra room. It took me a while to convert, but now, I can attest that <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/394848/are-ultrawide-monitors-worth-it.html\">ultrawide monitors are worth it</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"the-best-ultrawide-monitor-weve-tested\">\n\t\t\t\t\tThe best ultrawide monitor we've tested\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"alienware-aw3423dwf\">Alienware AW3423DWF</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Alienware AW3423DWF\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/alienware-aw3423dwf-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1500\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review product-widget__review-details\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Editors' Choice\" class=\"product-widget__review-details--editors-choice-logo\" src=\"https://www.pcworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PC-ED-CHOICE.png\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__rating-and-review-link\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__review-details--rating\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1440675/alienware-aw3423dwf-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\nMonitors</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1673092/im-an-ultrawide-believer-now.html", "date_published": "2023-04-03 10:45:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Lenovo IdeaPad 5 Gaming Chromebook review: Packing a cloud gaming punch", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n<div class=\"review\" id=\"review-body\"><span class=\"review-title\">At a glance</span><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"experts-rating\">Expert's Rating</h3><div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n<div><div class=\"review-columns\"><div class=\"review-column\"><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"pros\">Pros</h3><ul class=\"pros review-list\"><li>Large, bright 2560&times;1600 display</li><li>Ideal wireless and wired connectivity</li><li>Good display, strong speakers</li></ul></div><div class=\"review-column\"><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"cons\">Cons</h3><ul class=\"cons review-list\"><li>Unimpressive design</li><li>Mediocre keyboard and touchpad</li><li>Lackluster webcam and microphone</li></ul></div></div></div><h3 class=\"review-subTitle review-subTitle--borderTop\" id=\"our-verdict\">Our Verdict</h3><p class=\"verdict\">Google might&rsquo;ve killed Stadia, but gaming Chromebooks are still a thing&mdash;and Lenovo&rsquo;s IdeaPad 5 Gaming Chromebook proves they&rsquo;re worth your time.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Google&rsquo;s decision to partner with laptop makers on gaming Chromebooks couldn&rsquo;t have happened at a worse time.

It has an Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB solid state drive. That&rsquo;s near the top of what&rsquo;s available from Chromebooks right now&mdash;at least until models with Intel 13th-gen Core arrive on store shelves.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>CPU: Intel Core i5-1235U</li><li>Memory: 8GB</li><li>Graphics/GPU: Intel Iris Xe</li><li>Display: 2560&times;1600 </li><li>Storage: 256GB SSD</li><li>Webcam: 720p with IR</li><li>Connectivity: 2x USB-C with Power Delivery and DisplayPort 1.4, 2x USB-A, 1x microSD card reader, 1x combo 3.5mm audio jack</li><li>Networking: Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.1</li><li>Biometrics: None</li><li>Battery capacity: 71 watt-hours</li><li>Dimensions: 14.04 x 9.96 x 0.78 inches</li><li>Weight: 4.01 pounds</li><li>MSRP: $569.99</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Lenovo also packs in a 16-inch, 2560&times;1600 display, Wi-Fi 6E, two USB-C ports, and a large 71 watt-hour battery. It all looks great on paper&ndash;but can a Chromebook really handle modern games?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"lenovo-ideapad-5-gaming-chromebook-design-and-build-quality\">Lenovo IdeaPad 5 Gaming Chromebook: Design and build quality</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Lenovo IdeaPad 5 Gaming Chromebook design\" class=\"wp-image-1677654\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lenovo-chromebook-16-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t know the IdeaPad 5 Gaming Chromebook is built for gaming by looking at it. The laptop relies on simple gray exterior plastics with a contrasting strip of matte gray to liven up the look. I think it&rsquo;s handsome, but it won&rsquo;t cause anyone to do a double-take. Lenovo could&rsquo;ve labeled this a business or education model without a change to the design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looks aside, the IdeaPad 5 Gaming Chromebook offers modern conveniences. It has extremely slim display bezels that keep the laptop&rsquo;s footprint restrained despite its 16-inch, 16:10 aspect ratio display. The laptop measures just a smidge over 14 inches wide, less than 10 inches deep, and about .8 inches thick. It&rsquo;s not small, to be sure, but smaller than many 15.6-inch laptops sold a few years ago.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Material quality isn&rsquo;t impressive, however. All laptop surfaces are plastic (though the lid at least <em>looks</em> like metal) and flex can be found across both the display lid and lower chassis. None of this is a surprise given the laptop&rsquo;s price point, but Lenovo&rsquo;s competitors can do better. The Acer Chromebook 516 GE, for example, offers a partially aluminum chassis that feels more luxurious.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"lenovo-ideapad-5-gaming-chromebook-keyboard-and-trackpad\">Lenovo IdeaPad 5 Gaming Chromebook: Keyboard and trackpad</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Lenovo IdeaPad 5 Gaming Chromebook keyboard\" class=\"wp-image-1677647\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lenovo-chromebook-16-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Lenovo puts the IdeaPad 5 Gaming Chromebook&rsquo;s girth to good use with a spacious keyboard layout. A numpad with half-sized keys is squeezed into the right-hand side.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Key travel is long and the layout provides plenty of room to stretch, but key action is a bit mushy and tactile feel is minimal. This being a Chromebook, the laptop includes Google&rsquo;s special row of function keys, which provide easy access to functions like volume, brightness, and browser refresh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keyboard backlighting comes standard. The color of the backlight can be customized directly through Chrome OS&rsquo;s settings, but the range of customization is limited to a handful of colors and a predefined rainbow option. Still, this is a great option given the laptop&rsquo;s price. Most in this bracket stick with a white keyboard backlight with zero customization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A modest touchpad lurks below the keyboard. It measures four and a half inches wide by two and a half inches deep. It feels responsive and never seems cramped, but a little extra space would be appreciated (there&rsquo;s certainly room for it).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also noticed the touchpad is significantly offset towards the left in an effort to keep it centered below the spacebar. Users with large hands should be wary, as this may cause your left hand to dangle a tad off the side of the palmrest. Personally, I prefer the Acer Chromebook 516 GE&rsquo;s approach. It ditches the numpad entirely to focus on a centered touchpad and keyboard. Your mileage will vary depending on how much you value the numpad&rsquo;s presence.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"lenovo-ideapad-5-gaming-chromebook-display-audio\">Lenovo IdeaPad 5 Gaming Chromebook: Display, audio</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming Chromebook\" class=\"wp-image-1677627\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lenovo-chromebook-16-6.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The IdeaPad 5 Gaming Chromebook I tested had a huge 16-inch 2560&times;1600 display with a 16:10 aspect ratio and a 120Hz refresh rate. This is an upgrade from the entry-level mode, which instead offers a 16-inch 1920&times;1200 screen with a 60Hz refresh rate. Both displays use IPS LCD technology and have an anti-glare, non-gloss finish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Image quality is mediocre. The IPS LCD display offers attractive color and a reasonable maximum brightness of up to 350 nits, but the display&rsquo;s unimpressive contrast ratio saps depth and drama from the image. Dark scenes often look hazy and shadows lack detail.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite these flaws, the IdeaPad 5 Gaming Chromebook&rsquo;s display is an improvement over most budget gaming laptops, such as entry-level <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/700135/acer-nitro-5-review-a-gamers-gaming-laptop.html\">Acer Nitro 5</a> and Asus TUF gaming laptops. Windows gaming laptops in this price range tend to have a narrow, dull color gamut and an even lower contrast ratio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Lenovo&rsquo;s 120Hz refresh rate is another advantage. It looks extremely smooth in games, but also enhances the day-to-day visual experience. Scrolling feels slick and animated transitions between apps or web pages look responsive.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the display is a perk, there is one big catch: not all cloud gaming services support 2,560 x 1,600 resolution at up to 120Hz. As far as I&rsquo;m aware, Nvidia GeForce Now and Shadow Blade are the only widely available services that support this resolution and refresh rate. You can use other services, of course, but the image may appear softer than you&rsquo;d expect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gaming aside, the display looks great when browsing the web or writing in Google Docs. The display&rsquo;s sharp, bright image renders fine fonts with outstanding clarity, and the anti-glare coat takes the edge of harsh lighting. The 16-inch, 16:10 aspect ratio provides plenty of screen space for multi-tasking, too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The laptop&rsquo;s built-in speakers are great for the price. They&rsquo;re upward-firing, which means the sound won&rsquo;t be muffled by your laptop, and provide good stereo stage separation along with a hint of loud-end oomph in music and movies. The mid-range can still be muddy at times and volume is merely adequate, but the speakers are a cut above most Chromebooks and similarly priced Windows laptops.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"lenovo-ideapad-5-gaming-chromebook-webcam-microphone-biometrics\">Lenovo IdeaPad 5 Gaming Chromebook: Webcam, microphone, biometrics</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Lenovo serves up a basic 720p webcam for the IdeaPad 5 Gaming Chromebook. Brightness and color reproduction are acceptable, but video looks soft and imprecise. Those concerned about privacy will be happy to see the inclusion of a physical privacy shutter that can completely block the camera.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microphone quality is good, with strong volume and clarity. Background noises can intrude depending on their volume and consistency, but minor hums (like a space heater) are not a problem. The privacy shutter doesn&rsquo;t disable the microphone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biometric login isn&rsquo;t an option on this Chromebook. That&rsquo;s not a surprise, as very few Chromebooks choose to include this feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"lenovo-ideapad-5-gaming-chromebook-connectivity\">Lenovo IdeaPad 5 Gaming Chromebook: Connectivity</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Lenovo IdeaPad 5 Gaming Chromebook ports\" class=\"wp-image-1677650\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lenovo-chromebook-16-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>This Chromebook leans into USB-C with two ports that support USB Power Delivery and DisplayPort Alternate Mode. Both USB-C ports can charge the laptop and provide video input to a USB-C monitor. A USB-C power brick is bundled with the laptop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A pair of USB-A ports are included, too, for use with older wired devices. A MicroSD card reader and 3.5mm combo audio jack round out the options.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m happy to report the laptop supports Bluetooth 5.1 and Wi-Fi 6E, which is the latest Wi-Fi standard. That&rsquo;s important for a gaming Chromebook. Wi-Fi 6 is more than capable of handling cloud gaming, but extra bandwidth is never a bad thing. <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/552421/wi-fi-performance-matters-more-than-you-think.html\">Wi-Fi 6E also has an additional 6GHz band</a> that may improve network reliability if you have numerous devices connected. You&rsquo;ll need a Wi-Fi 6E router to take advantage of this, however.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"lenovo-ideapad-5-gaming-chromebook-performance\">Lenovo IdeaPad 5 Gaming Chromebook: Performance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The IdeaPad 5 Gaming Chromebook is equipped with Intel&rsquo;s Core i5-1235U, a 10-core processor with two performance cores and eight efficient cores. It&rsquo;s a modest processor compared to Windows gaming laptops but extremely powerful for a Chromebook. That&rsquo;s good news for the laptop&rsquo;s benchmark results.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lenovo doesn&rsquo;t skimp on the extra, providing 8GB of RAM and 256GB of solid state storage. That&rsquo;s excellent for a Chromebook and offers plenty of room for owners to work with. In my experience, a 256GB SSD on a Chromebook feels similar to a 1TB drive on a Windows laptop, as the reduced storage space is offset by the fact most apps (including games) run in the cloud.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s how the Lenovo IdeaPad 5 Gaming Chromebook fared in five browser-based benchmarks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>CrXPRT 2: 184</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Speedometer: 124</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Basemark Web 3.0: 1193</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Kraken: 502.7</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Jetstream 2: 211.928</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These are strong scores that go toe-to-toe with other recent Chromebooks with Intel Core i5 processors, such as the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1427108/acer-chromebook-vero-514-review.html\">Acer Chromebook Vero 514</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1431799/framework-laptop-chromebook-review.html\">Framework Laptop Chromebook</a>. The Intel-powered Lenovo is a tad ahead of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1475407/the-acer-chromebook-spin-514-review.html\">Acer Chromebook Spin 514</a> with AMD Ryzen processor in most tests, though the benchmark results are close overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What about gaming? Games installed to the Chromebook don&rsquo;t run well&mdash;or at all. Android games are technically available through the Google Play Store and Android emulation, but demanding titles are out of the question. <em>Call of Duty: Mobile</em> crashes to desktop. <em>Genshin Impact</em> will launch and is vaguely playable, but looks terrible and suffers several hitching. <em>Asphalt 8</em> is smooth enough to play but struggles with infrequent stutters that sour the experience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cloud gaming, on the other hand, is an excellent experience. The IdeaPad 5 Gaming Chromebook can stream a cloud gaming service at up to 2,560 x 1,600 resolution and 120Hz. Using <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/630335/geforce-now-review.html\">Nvidia&rsquo;s GeForce Now with an Ultimate Membership</a>, which provides access to RTX 4080-class hardware, I ran <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>at 136 FPS with Ultra detail and Ultra ray-tracing on (with DLSS 3 enabled). And here&rsquo;s the kicker: I was on Wi-Fi 6 in a detached shed that&rsquo;s 50 feet and several walls away from my home router.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s an amazing result. You&rsquo;d have to spend thousands for similar performance from a Windows laptop rendering the game locally. I was equally surprised by how solid the IdeaPad 5 Gaming Chromebook&rsquo;s Wi-Fi adapter performed in this situation. It&rsquo;s a tough scenario, as the range between the router and the Chromebook results in just 90 Mbps of bandwidth and spotty latency, but the game felt smooth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The catch? You&rsquo;ll need to pay a monthly fee for access to the GeForce Now service (or any other that you choose to use). You&rsquo;ll also be limited to games supported by cloud services. If you can deal with those constraints, however, cloud gaming on a Chromebook is a fantastic experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"lenovo-ideapad-5-gaming-chromebook-battery-life\">Lenovo IdeaPad 5 Gaming Chromebook: Battery life</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Lenovo IdeaPad 5 Gaming Chromebook packs a large 71 watt-hour battery into its ample chassis. It&rsquo;s a beefy battery for a Chromebook and it pays off when you&rsquo;re on the road. I recorded 15 hours and 56 minutes of battery life in the CrXPT 2 battery life test.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s healthy endurance, beating out the Acer Chromebook Vero 514, Acer Chromebook Spin 514, and Framework Chromebook Laptop, among others we&rsquo;ve recently reviewed. It&rsquo;s also a huge leap over Windows gaming laptops, which often struggle to hit five hours of battery life on a charge.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"lenovo-ideapad-5-gaming-chromebook-conclusion\">Lenovo IdeaPad 5 Gaming Chromebook: Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The IdeaPad 5 Gaming Chromebook is a solid entry into the Chromebook arena for both cloud and day-to-day productivity. It has a bright, sharp display, good performance, great network connectivity, tons of ports, and long battery life.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lenovo&rsquo;s design is a whiff, though, and that&rsquo;s a wrinkle. The Acer Chromebook 516 GE, an alternative gaming-focused Chromebook with a 16-inch display, offers everything found in the Lenovo alongside a more attractive and luxurious chassis. Acer also provides a slightly quicker Intel Core i5-1240P processor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That makes the Lenovo tough to recommend, especially when the Acer is on sale (<a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Facer-chromebook-516-ge-cloud-gaming-chromebook-16-2560x1600-120hz-intel-core-i5-1240p-8gb-ram-256gb-ssd-rgb-kb-titanium-gray%2F6516347.p%3FskuId%3D6516347%26%23038%3Bref%3D212%26%23038%3Bloc%3D1%26%23038%3BextStoreId%3D453%26%23038%3Bref%3D212%26%23038%3Bloc%3D1%26%23038%3B%26%23038%3B%26%23038%3Bgclid%3DCjwKCAjw_YShBhAiEiwAMomsEKCIyFAiQjBL2lEv4QaOCCV7vWkRnwdAMgzu9z84AJ-c78PoaSfRIxoCWR4QAvD_BwE%26%23038%3Bgclsrc%3Daw.ds&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed\" rel=\"nofollow\">it&rsquo;s currently available for $549.99 at Best Buy</a>).
