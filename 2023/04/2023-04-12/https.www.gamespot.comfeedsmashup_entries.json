One of the most impactful changes is the barter feature, which lets you find recipes to barter for items you need. Here we walk you through the best recipes in Season 3 of DMZ.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">How DMZ's barter recipes work</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Season 3's new barter system isn't player-to-player trading, but more of a way to swap scavenged items at a Buy Station to trade for something else you need. This bartering is done using recipes, which are component lists needed to receive the new items.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">These recipes are found at the Buy Stations around the maps, and they are set lists that can be memorized for easy bartering. Most recipes will be common across all maps, but Building 21 and Ashika Island locations each have a few of their own unique sets of barter options across its Buy Stations, but we'll highlight the important ones here.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-2-dmz-best-barter-recipes-in-season-3/1100-6513224/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link":

The first-party <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Core-Controller-Robot-White-one/dp/B08DF26MXW?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20\">Xbox Wireless Controller</a> has held the top spot on our list since the Xbox One era, and that probably won't change during the Xbox Series X|S lifecycle either. Similarly, the best <em>premium </em>Xbox controller is still the superb <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Elite-2-Controller-Black-Xbox-One/dp/B07SFKTLZM?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20\">Elite Series 2</a>--though now there are <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Elite-Wireless-Controller-Core-Controllers/dp/B0B789CGGQ?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20\">a few different models</a> to choose from. Having said all that, there are a bunch of truly great third-party Xbox controllers that are worth checking out, especially if you're looking for pro-style customization features without breaking the bank. We've rounded up the best Xbox Series X|S controllers available now.</p><p>Outside of the pair of first-party Xbox controllers that are probably always on your mind when shopping for a new controller, there are compelling alternatives from popular third-party brands, including 8BitDo, HyperX, Razer, Turtle Beach, and more.</p><p>For instance, if you prefer aligned joysticks or play a lot of games that work better with D-pad controls, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/8BitDo-Wired-Controller-Xbox-Windows-x/dp/B07P5K93ZN?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20\">8BitDo Pro 2</a> is a better pick than Microsoft's controllers. If you are focused on competitive multiplayer, you may want to consider the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Wolverine-Chroma-Gaming-Controller/dp/B09CKFSRK7?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20\">Razer Wolverine V2 Chroma</a>, which features ultra-quick actuation and other features aimed at improving multiplayer performance. Also, Xbox gamers might be nostalgic for the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Hyperkin-Wired-Controller-Windows-Green-Limited/dp/B07GC2YSBG?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20\">Duke</a>--the ill-fated original Xbox controller that some folks fondly remember for some reason. Of course, Xbox is also home to the most inventive and important gaming controller of our time.

The excellent \"Chapter 23: The Spies,\" directed by series staple Rick Famuyiwa, is quite dense with lore--by and large, these Easter eggs are substantial updates on characters and situations we've wondered about for years.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Even better, some of these Easter eggs are introducing direct plot throughlines from Return of the Jedi to The Force Awakens the likes of which we've never had before. This is a <em>big</em> episode.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Warning: This article contains major spoilers for Chapter 23 of The Mandalorian, titled \"The Spies.\"</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Most of this week's episode concerns the return of the Manadalorians to their homeworld in force, but before that we had our first scene with Giancarlo Esposito's Moff Gideon this season--he's receiving an update from the spy Elia Kane within the New Republic about the threat that a united Mandalorian force might pose to the Empire's short-term plans.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">As soon as that phone call ends, Gideon steps into a Zoom meeting with other Imperial leaders to talk about how to handle that Mandalorian threat--and also to talk about Thrawn, the blue Imperial Grand Admiral who's been missing since the series finale of Rebels.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">From there, we move to the titular Mandalorian Din Djarin and the massive new army of fighters from Bo-Katan's old crew and Din's Mando cult. And this combined force immediately makes its big move toward Mandalore. There they meet even more Mandalorians--survivors of the Purge of Mandalore who have just been living down there the whole time--and then they all walk right into Moff Gideon's trap.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">This episode is easily the best of the entire series, and it's got plenty of Easter eggs--but these are largely meaty and substantial references to the greater franchise that hold serious big-picture story implications. Let's dive in.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. Imperial Shadow Council</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4124624-themandalorianprojectnecromancerimperialshadowcouncilmoffgideon.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p dir=\"ltr\">In the second scene of the episode, Moff Gideon meets with a group he refers to as the \"Shadow Council.\" This is a secretive Imperial leadership group that was established by Imperial Admiral Gallius Rax immediately after the Emperor's death in the Aftermath trilogy of novels. The group was formed to serve as an oligarchy that secretly ran the Empire behind a figurehead, but it looks like they currently secretly run the Empire while pretending they have no manner of combined leadership at all.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Only one member of the original Shadow Council is still around in the new one. We'll talk about him in a moment.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. Grand Admiral Thrawn</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4124819-themandalorianchapter23eastereggsthrawn.jpg\" /><br /><em>Thrawn on Rebels</em><br /><h3><p>Originally created by author Timothy Zahn for the Expanded Universe novel Heir to the Empire in 1991, Thrawn was conceived as an unrivaled tactical genius who nearly managed to keep the Empire together after the Emperor's death. Thrawn was brought into Disney's Star Wars continuity as a major antagonist on Rebels, and he's been missing since the Rebels series finale--but apparently he now runs the remnants of the Empire through his representative on the Shadow Council, Captain Pellaeon. While we didn't actually <em>see</em> him in this episode, this is the first time he's been mentioned in live-action Star Wars. And <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-rebels-lars-mikkelsen-will-portray-grand-admiral-thrawn-on-ahsoka/1100-6513110/\">we already know</a> he'll be here soon enough.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. Captain Pellaeon</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4124817-themandalorianchapter23eastereggscaptainpellaeon.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Pellaeon himself is also an interesting pull, because he also originated in Heir to the Empire as the captain of Thrawn's flagship, the star destroyer Chimaera. But aside from one very brief cameo in the Rebels finale and a new backstory in one of the Thrawn novels, he hasn't really been much of a part of the Disney timeline. Until now, anyway. Pellaeon is played by TV veteran Xander Berkeley, who isn't really the sort of actor you hire for a cameo--it would be very unsurprising if we saw him again, either in the Mandalorian season finale next week or on the Ahsoka series later this year.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. Commandant Hux</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4124820-themandalorianchapter23eastereggscommandanthux.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>You remember General Armitage Hux, that First Order guy in the sequel trilogy who screamed that speech about order before blowing up the New Republic capital planet? Well, this is his dad, the previously mentioned only surviving member of the original Shadow Council from the Aftermath novels. Commandant Brendol Hux goes on to help found the First Order, and then eventually he's killed by Captain Phasma on behalf of his son--he wasn't a great dad.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">General Hux was played by Domhnall Gleeson in the sequel trilogy, and here his father, Commandant Hux, is played by Gleeson's brother Brian.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. Project Necromancer</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4124812-themandalorianchapter23eastereggsprojectnecromancer.jpg\" /><br /><em>Cloning tanks on Exegol, in The Rise of Skywalker</em><br /><h3><p>We learn that Commandant Hux is in charge of something called Project Necromancer, which involves cloning and is intended to provide a new leader for the remnants of the Empire. This <em>has</em> to be the project to resurrect Emperor Palpatine's spirit in a clone body that is strong enough to support it. If it isn't that, then this would have to be something new we haven't heard about before.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6. Praetorian Guard</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4124816-themandalorianchapter23eastereggspraetorianguard.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>During this scene, Gideon manages to convince Pellaeon and Hux to provide him with reinforcements for his losses against the Mandalorians, as well as the use of three members of the Praetorian Guard. And we didn't have to wait too long to see these badass Praetorians in action, because they duke it out with Paz Viszla at the end of the episode. If these guys look familiar, it's because we previously saw the Praetorian Guard protecting Supreme Leader Snoke in The Last Jedi--until Kylo Ren and Rey killed them and Snoke, anyway.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7. Fake Chess</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4124815-themandalorianchapter23eastereggsnewchess.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Star Wars has a lot of different versions of chess, like the one with holographic monsters they played on the Millennium Falcon in A New Hope. And this one that we see Paz Viszla and Axe Woves playing in this episode is a new chess-like game that was invented for The Mandalorian. Though in Star Wars these are not actually variations on chess--in this universe, all of these chess-like games <em>and</em> chess itself are derived from a board game called Shah-tezh. This is not an important fact, but it <em>is</em> a fun one.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>8. Ankylosaurus</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4124814-themandalorianchapter23eastereggsankylosaurus.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>We were all waiting for our merry band of Mandos to fight the mythosaur that we saw at the beginning of the season, but instead they had to face a different gigantic lizard monster with a massive spiked tail. While we never got a full-body shot of this guy, everything we <em>did </em>see looked like this was a kaiju-sized ankylosaurus--a real dinosaur that existed on Earth during the late Cretecaous Period. On Earth, though, these things were only a couple dozen feet long, rather than the size of a large building.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>9. Beskar stormtroopers look more like First Order stormtroopers</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4124813-themandalorianchapter23eastereggsbeskarstormtroopers.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Moff Gideon didn't just bomb Mandalore to smithereens and then move on with his life--no, he set up a base there to mine beskar ore, and he's been outfitting stormtroopers with beskar armor and jetpacks. But this new stormtrooper armor isn't just better at protecting the wearer. It also looks different. In fact, the helmet looks a lot like they crossed Mandalorian stylings with the helmets of the First Order stormtroopers from the sequel trilogy.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">And, as Poe Dameron once said: They fly now.</p></h3></p><br />", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-mandalorian-season-3-episode-7-easter-eggs-9-things-you-missed-in-chapter-23-the-spies/2900-4714/", "date_published": "2023-04-12 19:56:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Super Mario Bros.

It still features familiar elements from the series' past--back when Tiger Woods was front and center--such as slow-motion heartbeat moments and climactic power shots. But after an eight-year hiatus from the world of golf simulation, EA has returned to the fairway with a more demanding recreation of the sport that's as much about feel as it is mastering the game's robust mechanics. With 30 courses covering all four majors--including The Masters at Augusta National--EA Sports PGA Tour has a plethora of golfing action to sink your teeth into. It's just a shame there are a few notable issues in critical areas that hold it back from greatness.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The first of these is the game's swing mechanic. If you've played a golf game before, the actual act of swinging a driver or 5-iron will be familiar. You pull down on the analog stick to bring the club back, then push forward again to unleash your shot. This has been a staple in golf games for a number of years now, and there aren't any alternatives at the moment--not until a three-click system is implemented in a later update. The issue with EA Sports PGA Tour is that there's a slight delay between your input and the on-screen visual. Your swing isn't 1:1, so there's an uneasy disconnect where you never quite feel like you're in total control. The general malaise of each swing doesn't help matters either, with the slow, clunky pacing and frustrating lag making it difficult to nail the timing and power of each shot. I eventually grew accustomed to these idiosyncrasies over time, but it never feels quite right and fails to capture the satisfaction that hitting a 300-yard tee shot should achieve.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">To compound the issue, EA Sports PGA Tour also lacks any sort of meaningful tutorial. There are tooltips that pop up and cover the basics the first time you play, but these brief snippets barely scratch the surface of everything going on under the hood. Instead, the game has a suite of challenges that happen to include a Coaching Academy. This is the best place to start, even if these challenges still neglect to offer any tips or feedback to help you along the way. What you get is a variety of contextual situations covering different aspects of the sport, from putting downhill to dealing with elevation changes and the multitude of shot types on offer. There's a lot of trial and error involved, but the repetition of replaying each situation does give you a greater understanding of how everything works. It's not a very user-friendly approach, but it sets expectations and is genuinely helpful in an unconventional way, even if it might prove frustrating for some. Plus, completing these challenges also earns you XP that can be used to improve your created character.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ea-sports-pga-tour-review-hit-the-links/1900-6418053/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ea-sports-pga-tour-review-hit-the-links/1900-6418053/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-04-12 17:38:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "The Best Gaming Controller Deals For Switch, Xbox, And PS5", "description": "<p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1702/17023653/4124613-xboxcontrollers%281%29.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>If you're looking for a new controller for Nintendo Switch, Xbox, PS5, PC, or even your mobile device, you've come to the right place.

Though more recent expansions, like Dragonflight, do feature more cutscenes and dialogue than in WoW's early days, the vast majority of the game's NPCs and quests are not voiced.</p><div>          </div><p dir=\"ltr\">That's where the fan made add-on called <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/voiceover\">VoiceOver</a> comes in. Created by Evan Pierce (who goes by MrThinger), the free VoiceOver addon for WoW Classic adds \"high quality AI generated voices for NPCs,\" and it's a bit of a game changer. The add-on takes into account the race and gender of the NPC giving quests when generating voices and overall makes for a more immersive, less text-heavy version of Blizzard's old-school MMO. Players can even replay NPC dialogue via the quest log, allowing users to listen for their next objective while on the move without the need to scan paragraphs of text for where they need to go or what they need to collect.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-classic-ai-add-on-gives-old-school-mmo-full-voice-acting-for-the-first-time/1100-6513205/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-classic-ai-add-on-gives-old-school-mmo-full-voice-acting-for-the-first-time/1100-6513205/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-04-12 16:51:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "The Mandalorian Season 3 Just Casually Teased Emperor Palpatine's Resurrection", "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">One of the biggest criticisms of the Star Wars sequel trilogy from die-hard fans was the lack of context and world-building--even now we have very little sense of how we got from the end of Return of the Jedi to the beginning of The Force Awakens.

One of the most prominent sources since the franchise's creation has been video games, with studios reimagining Star Wars' existing stories and characters or creating new ones across dozens of gaming genres, including racing games, shooters, flight simulators, and role-playing games. And though <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/its-time-for-star-wars-games-to-get-weird/1100-6486292/\">Star Wars games could stand to get a little bit weirder</a> going forward, there have already been plenty of wonderful games that take place in a galaxy far, far away. Ahead of the release of <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-survivor-final-preview/1100-6512918/\">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a>, we've rounded up the 10 best Star Wars games.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">As a quick note: These games are not listed in the order of best to worst, or vice versa. We've simply listed them in the order by which they launched, from 1994's <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-tie-fighter/\">TIE Fighter</a> to 2021's <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-republic-commando/\">Republic Commando Remastered</a> and every game we loved in between. And yes, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic/\">KOTOR</a> is on the list. You do not have to keep scrolling if you came here just to make sure that we didn't forget to list KOTOR--we got you. A <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kotor-remake-for-ps5-and-pc-changes-developers-still-two-years-away-report/1100-6506752/\">KOTOR remake</a> is in the works, though we haven't heard anything new since it switched development studios last summer.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">With <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/star-wars-jedi-survivor-preorder-guide/2900-4523/\">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor releasing later this month</a>, there's a chance this list could change in the near future--if it matches or builds on the greatness of Fallen Order. Plus, Survivor is just one of <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-upcoming-star-wars-game/2900-3917/\">many Star Wars games in development</a>.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Star Wars: TIE Fighter</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1595/15950357/3973024-1starwarstiefighter.jpeg\" /><br /><h3><p>Developer Totally Games' Star Wars: TIE Fighter is a flight simulator meets space combat game set in the Star Wars universe that wowed fans back in 1994 and surprisingly still holds up in several ways today. It begins immediately following the events of The Empire Strikes Back and continues until the final battle of Return of the Jedi, having you play as a talented TIE pilot charged with going after pirates or traitors to the Galactic Empire. It's a shame that TIE Fighter is no longer canon, as it tells a superb story about what it was like to be an Imperial during the events of the original Star Wars trilogy. The game provides insight into \"the bad guys\" of Star Wars, showing that most Imperial soldiers weren't Emperor Palpatine-level evil. It's a perspective that other Star Wars video games--like Battlefront II and Squadrons--have tried to replicate, but have never quite done as well as TIE Fighter. Star Wars: TIE Fighter is available for PC.</p><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://www.gog.com/game/star_wars_tie_fighter_special_edition\">See on GOG</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1595/15950357/3973025-2jediknight2.jpeg\" /><br /><h3><p>Developer Raven Software's Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast is the third game in the Jedi Knight series, which began with 1995's Dark Forces. The series follows Kyle Katarn, a mercenary-turned-Jedi who briefly embraces the Dark Side and thus can use all manner of Force abilities. In Jedi Outcast, Kyle has forsaken the Force, only to learn that he needs to reconnect with his Force sensitivity in order to combat a threat posed to the New Republic. Jedi Outcast is the point in the Jedi Knight series where combat fully transitions to a hybrid of shooter and lightsaber combat. That, along with the really good single-player campaign, makes Jedi Outcast the best of the Jedi Knight games. Jedi Outcast also sees Kyle meet with several popular Star Wars characters, like Luke Skywalker and Lando Calrissian, providing a look at their lives (admittedly, one that is no longer canon) after the events of Return of the Jedi. Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast is available for PS4, Switch, Xbox, GameCube, and PC.</p><p><em>See our <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/jedi-knight-ii-jedi-outcast-review/1900-2859529/\">Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast review</a>.</em></p><ul><li><span class=\"norewrite\">           <a href=\"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1032-CUSA16624_00-STARWARSOUTCAST1/\">See on PlayStation Store</a> </span></li><li><span class=\"norewrite\">           <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/star-wars-jedi-knight-ii-jedi-outcast-switch/\">See on Switch eShop</a> </span></li><li><span class=\"norewrite\">           <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/6030/STAR_WARS_Jedi_Knight_II__Jedi_Outcast/\">See on Steam</a> </span></li><li><span class=\"norewrite\">           <a href=\"https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/star-wars-jedi-knight-ii-jedi-outcast/9pgjx8s0zxd9\">See on Xbox Store</a> </span></li></ul></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1595/15950357/3973026-3kotor.jpeg\" /><br /><h3><p>Developer BioWare's Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is beloved by Star Wars fans as one of the best (if not the best) Star Wars games ever made. Set thousands of years prior to the events of The Phantom Menace, KOTOR sees you exploring the Star Wars galaxy in an effort to find a way to stop Darth Malak, a Sith who killed his master, Darth Revan, to take over the Sith armada and launch an invasion against the Galactic Republic and a fractured Jedi Order. Along the way, you recruit new allies, learn Force abilities, and make meaningful choices that influence both how the story ultimately ends and whether you embrace the Light or Dark Side of the Force. KOTOR also introduces some of the best Star Wars characters ever created, such as Jedi Knight Bastila Shan, Twi'lek street urchin Mission Vao, and assassin droid HK-47. Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is available on Xbox, Switch, PC, and both Android and iOS devices. As mentioned already, a KOTOR remake is currently in development at Aspyr.</p><p><em>See our <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-review/1900-6071718/\">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic review</a>.</em></p><ul><li><span class=\"norewrite\">           <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic/bs8lfd7729cl\">See on Xbox Store</a> </span></li><li><span class=\"norewrite\">           <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/32370/STAR_WARS__Knights_of_the_Old_Republic/\">See on Steam</a> </span></li><li><span class=\"norewrite\">           <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-switch/\">See on Switch eShop</a> </span></li></ul></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Star Wars: The Old Republic</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1595/15950357/3973027-4theoldrepublic.jpeg\" /><br /><h3><p>Developer BioWare Austin's Star Wars: The Old Republic has come a long way since its launch in 2011--this massively multiplayer online role-playing game is still kicking too, with a thriving playerbase and an eighth major content expansion, Legacy of the Sith, coming out in celebration of its 10-year run. Taking place hundreds of years after the events of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, The Old Republic allows you to play through eight distinct storylines during the ongoing conflict between the Sith Empire and Galactic Republic. Each storyline sees you recruiting different squadmates, responding to different moral-based dialogue choices, wielding different weapons and abilities, meeting different characters, and having the chance to fall in love with different romance options. So you basically have eight different story-driven RPGs here, all of which feature missions you can tackle alongside well-written NPC companions or real-world players. Star Wars: The Old Republic is available for PC.</p><p><em>See our <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-the-old-republic-review/1900-6348266/\">Star Wars: The Old Republic review</a>.</em></p><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1286830/STAR_WARS_The_Old_Republic/\">See on Steam</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Star Wars: Battlefront II</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1595/15950357/3973028-6battlefront2.jpeg\" /><br /><h3><p>Developer DICE's Star Wars: Battlefront II (not to be confused with Pandemic Studios' 2005 game Star Wars: Battlefront II) made an <em>extremely </em>rough first impression in 2017--there aren't many games that can claim to have a microtransaction controversy prior to their official launch on par with this one. But to the credit of DICE (and support studios Criterion Games and Motive Studios), Battlefront II got substantial post-launch content, balancing updates, bug fixes, and (most importantly) adjustments to how the in-game economy works. It's now a rewarding game to play, with a decent-but-not-fantastic single-player campaign about an elite Galactic Empire special forces trooper defecting to the New Republic, and an expansive online multiplayer experience with plenty of awesome modes to play. Star Wars: Battlefront II is available for Xbox One, PS4, and PC.</p><p><em>See our <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-battlefront-ii-review/1900-6416810/\">Star Wars: Battlefront II review</a>.</em></p><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Battlefront-II-PlayStation-4/dp/B06ZXTGFDR\">See on Amazon</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Vader Immortal: A Star Wars VR Series</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1595/15950357/3973029-7vaderimmortal.jpeg\" /><br /><h3><p>There are very few moments in Star Wars that capture how terrifying Darth Vader is--the final moments of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, his few appearances in Star Wars: Rebels Season 2, and his adventures in Kieron Gillen's Star Wars: Darth Vader are the standouts. But that overwhelming sense of fear that many feel when standing in Darth Vader's presence wasn't fully-realized within video games until developer ILMxLAB's Vader Immortal: A Star Wars VR Series. You don't quite realize just how imposingly tall and intimidating Vader is until he's looming over you and threatening your life. The game's story takes place in between Revenge of the Sith and Rogue One, seeing you play as a smuggler who gets caught up in Darth Vader's attempts to bring Padm\u00e9 Amidala back to life. Vader Immortal: A Star Wars VR Series is available for Oculus Quest, Oculus Rift, and PSVR.</p><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Vader-Immortal-Star-Wars-VR-PlayStation/dp/B0969VV4SK\">See at Amazon</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1595/15950357/3973030-8fallenorder.jpeg\" /><br /><h3><p>Developer Respawn Entertainment's Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is an action-adventure game that incorporates a Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice-like parry system for its lightsaber combat and takes inspiration from both metroidvania and Souls-like games for its exploration and progression. Taking place after Revenge of the Sith, Fallen Order sees you play as Jedi Padawan-turned-scrapper Cal Kestis, who goes on the run with Jedi Knight-turned-outlaw Cere Junda, pilot Greez Dritus, and droid BD-1 when Imperial Inquisitors Second Sister and Ninth Sister (former Jedi turned to the dark side and trained by Darth Vader) start hunting him. Fallen Order digs deep into some of the themes only glossed over in other Star Wars media, such as understanding yourself enough to fight against your own darkness and knowing how and when to ask for help when tackling an overwhelming adversity. There's some excellent storytelling going on when Cal meets Nightsister Merrin and the two try to broach common ground through the trauma of watching their respective orders fall. Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is available for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, and PC. A direct sequel, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, releases on April 28.</p><p><em>See our <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review-a-good-feeling-/1900-6417364/\">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order review</a>.</em></p><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Jedi-Fallen-Order-PlayStation/dp/B094F45TDX\">See at Amazon</a> </div></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Star Wars: Squadrons</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1595/15950357/3973031-9starwarssquadrons.jpeg\" /><br /><h3><p>Developer Motive Studios' Star Wars: Squadrons is fantastic. Though the game's single-player campaign--which sees you alternate between the newest members of the New Republic's Vanguard Squadron and the Galactic Empire's Titan Squadron following the events of Return of the Jedi--isn't very good beyond acting as a decent story-driven tutorial, online multiplayer is a blast to play. Matches put you into fast-paced 5v5 dogfights where communicating with your team and managing how much energy you're putting towards your shields, engines, or weapons is just as important as being a good shot. Squadrons is simple to learn but rewards commitment with a high skill ceiling--there are few things as satisfying as finally mastering an advanced maneuver and pulling it off at the end of a match to get the winning kill. Star Wars: Squadrons is available for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS4, and PC. The PS4 and PC versions can be played in VR.</p><p><em>See our <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-squadrons-review-catch-me-if-you-can/1900-6417582/\">Star Wars: Squadrons review</a>.</em></p><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Squadrons-PS4-playstation-4/dp/B08B6QBD53\">See at Amazon</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Star Wars: Republic Commando Remastered</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1595/15950357/3973032-10republiccommandoremastered.jpeg\" /><br /><h3><p>Developer LucasArts' Star Wars: Republic Commando was one of the earliest stories to explore the identical faces but vastly different personalities of the soldiers that make up the Galactic Republic's Clone Army. Aspyr Media's enhanced port is the same excellent game but with prettier visuals, a better control scheme, and no multiplayer (though Republic Commando's online multiplayer was never that good to begin with). Despite being an older game--Republic Commando first launched in 2005--it's still wonderful to get to know the members of Delta Squad (Boss, Scorch, Fixer, and Sev) as the four take part in three special ops missions in between the events of Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith. Star Wars: Republic Commando Remastered is available for PS4 and Switch.</p><p><em>See our <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-republic-commando-remastered-review/1900-6417662/\">Star Wars: Republic Commando Remastered review</a>.</em></p><ul><li><span class=\"norewrite\">           <a href=\"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1032-CUSA19302_00-STARWARSCOMMANDO/\">See on PlayStation Store</a> </span></li><li><span class=\"norewrite\">           <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/star-wars-republic-commando-switch/\">See on Switch eShop</a> </span></li></ul></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1595/15950357/3973033-11skywalkersaga.jpeg\" /><br /><h3><p>Multiple Lego Star Wars have been released over the years, but the latest iteration is the pinnacle of the sub-series. Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker improves on the sturdy foundation that has been built ever since the first game in Traveller's Tales sprawling Lego series--Lego Star Wars: The Video Game--released in 2005. The Skywalker Saga features a revamped combat system that makes gameplay feel fresh as well as more differentiated character types that add a ton of variety. Additionally, the visuals are markedly improved over previous Lego games. Yes, there are some visual bugs and performance issues that standout more on legacy platforms and Nintendo Switch, but overall The Skywalker Saga has a gorgeous world that's a joy to explore. </p><p>Where The Skywalker Saga really stands out is in its scope. Containing condensed versions of all nine Skywalker Saga films that can be played in any order, this Lego game is a charming romp through more than 40 years of Star Wars stories that features hundreds of characters. The writing is humorous and fun, and it's as fun as ever to play through cooperatively with family on the couch.</p><p><em>Read our <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga-review-duel-of-the-bricks/1900-6417859/\">Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga review</a>.</em></p><div><div class=\"norewrite\" title=\"\">           <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Lego-Star-Wars-Skywalker-Saga-PlayStation/dp/B07SK462S5\">See at Amazon</a> </div></div><p> </p></h3></p><br />", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-star-wars-games/2900-4064/", "date_published": "2023-04-12 16:36:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Disney Plus Drops Groovy Trailer For Musical Muppet Series Starring Dr. Teeth And The Electric Mayhem", "description": "<p>Disney+ has released the trailer for The Muppets Mayhem, a musical series set to premiere on May 10.

Nowadays, the relationship between these two types of RPGs is symbiotic--just as the adventures that players go on using pens, papers, dice, and mini figs have influenced game developers, the ideas explored in video games have inspired game makers and game masters alike, ultimately contributing greatly to TTRPGs' growing popularity. In that sense, the idea of another type of tabletop game, like a board game, being heavily influenced by video games isn't particularly novel--several video games have even been adapted into spectacular board games themselves. However, just about everything else in WizKid's upcoming board game, Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Trials of Tempus, is well-worth taking note of.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Set in the battle realm of Tempus, Trials of Tempus sees players compete in a mysterious, mystical, and high-stakes tournament in which there are multiple ways to emerge victorious. The half-cooperative, half-competitive board game divides players into two adventuring parties, each between 2 to 4 players (for games with only two players, the team recommends playing at least two characters each), and throws at them quests, obstacles, massive monsters, and opportunities to attack other players directly as they attempt to take home the gold--literally, in this case. The nature of the board game--which relies on quick-yet-deep character work, deck building, and random quests rather than a book of scenarios--makes for an experience offering hours of play, and its maps and mini figs all display a high level of polish. While unboxing the game with all its various components and figures was impressive enough, playing it was somehow even moreso. The game is incredibly fun and finds the sweet middle ground between a full Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaign and a game of Munchkin. While the copy I received is subject to change, I loved what I got to see.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In addition to playing Trials of Tempus myself, I got the chance to speak with publisher WizKids and the design team behind the game, Heavy Dragon, about the newly revealed board game. The trio of designers were quick to express how their love of games across every medium led to their desire to create Trials of Tempus. MOBAs like League of Legends, battle royale-style games like Apex Legends, and even the dystopian world of The Hunger Games all contributed to Heavy Dragon's vision of a Dungeons &amp; Dragons experience that was not only fast-paced, competitive, immersive, and replayable, but easy to play, easy to customize, and easy to fall in love with as well.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dungeons-and-dragons-meets-league-of-legends-in-wizkids-new-board-game-dungeons-and-dragons-trials-of-tempus/1100-6513182/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dungeons-and-dragons-meets-league-of-legends-in-wizkids-new-board-game-dungeons-and-dragons-trials-of-tempus/1100-6513182/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-04-12 16:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Star Wars TV Series Ahsoka Adds Hunger Games Actor - Report", "description": "<p>The Star Wars TV series Ahsoka has reportedly added a new cast member. <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2023/04/wes-chatham-ahsoka-disney-1235322615/\">Deadline</a> reports that Wes Chatham, whose credits include The Expanse, Hunger Games, and Tenet, will play a major character in the upcoming sci-fi show.</p><p>The report said Chatham will play the right-hand man to the villain Admiral Thrawn, who is played by Lars Mikkelsen.</p><p>Ahsoka stars Rosario Dawson as Ahsoka Tano.
