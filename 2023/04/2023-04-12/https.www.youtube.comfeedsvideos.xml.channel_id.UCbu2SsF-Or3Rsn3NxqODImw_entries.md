Draw power from Apocrypha itself and master three new Skill Lines with the Arcanist, an all-new class arriving with The Elder Scrolls Online: Necrom. Lay low your enemies with beams of eldritch light, protect yourself behind writhing tentacles, and summon healing shards of Oblivion to revitalize you and your allies. Manipulate arcane energies to further amplify your forbidden abilities, but be warned, there is a price to be paid when calling upon the unknown. Will you wield the power of the Arcanist?

Pre-purchase Necrom now to receive unique bonus rewards at launch and immediate access to the Sadrith Mora Spore Steed mount and Sadrith Mora Spore Pony pet*. Don't miss out!

*Sadrith Mora Spore Pony pet is only available until April 18, 2023.
