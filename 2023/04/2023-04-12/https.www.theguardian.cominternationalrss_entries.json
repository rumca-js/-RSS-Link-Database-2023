During lockdown I took on a challenge to reimagine great artworks in my home \u2013 and so brought Black history to life and explored what it means to take up space as a Black man</p><p>As <a href=\"https://www.peterbrathwaitebaritone.com/\">a Black British opera singer,</a> I am used to being a rare breed \u2013 still. Moreover, I am accustomed to having quizzical glances cast in my direction, as if I am something of a novelty or a curious anomaly. A large part of my musical career to date has been based on balancing and reconciling the tricky dichotomy of otherness in relation to myself and the canon of western classical music that I love and love to perform. And given that they are so few and far between, representations of people who look like me in the classical canon have always been of interest. As a student of opera, I clung to the album covers of the African American soprano Leontyne Price and a black-and-white postcard portrait of the Black British composer Samuel Coleridge-Taylor. These totemic images, my superheroes, became talismanic, protective figures when I found myself on the receiving end of everyday racism from fellow musicians \u2013 things like \u201cYou\u2019re the whitest Black man I know,\u201d, or \u201cYour performance was so good, I thought you were a white singer blacked up,\u201d or \u201cYou would have been a slave when this opera was written.\u201d Or the time a singing coach put her finger in my mouth because she just didn\u2019t understand how I, \u201ca Negro,\u201d could have an alveolar ridge.</p><p>In opera, I have been cast as an enslaved African man twice. Both times turned out to be opportunities to humanise Black characters that have all too often existed on the stage as one-dimensional stereotypes. With one of these roles in particular \u2013 the enslaved African Kaidam\u00e0 in Gaetano Donizetti\u2019s Il furioso all\u2019isola di San Domingo, a 19th-century opera set in the Caribbean \u2013 there was an urgent need to restore agency to an operatic character who has been portrayed in blackface well into the 21st century.
