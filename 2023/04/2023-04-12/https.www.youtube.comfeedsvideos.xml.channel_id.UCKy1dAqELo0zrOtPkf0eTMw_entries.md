## Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened Review

Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened reviewed by Tristan Ogilvie on PC. Also available on PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

"While Sherlock Holmes Chapter One may have its own fair share of flaws, it was still reasonably competent as a detective simulation. In comparison, this remade version of The Awakened feels far more like an inferior throwback to old-fashioned point-and-click adventures where trial and error was just as effective an approach as logic and reason, making its forensic deductions feel more like foregone conclusions. This wouldn’t be so bad if its Lovecraft-inspired mystery was compelling enough to sustain interest in its run-of-the-mill casework, but unfortunately it fumbles that too, with its hamfisted attempts at horror more likely to tickle ribs than raise hairs. Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened could have been an intriguing clash of Cluedo/Clue with Cthulu, but instead it’s just a case of squandered potential."
