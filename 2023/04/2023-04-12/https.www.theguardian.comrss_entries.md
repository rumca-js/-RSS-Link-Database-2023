<p>Local government ombudsman rules that delay in finding suitable accommodation for family caused serious health risks</p><p>A severely disabled child missed out on vital NHS surgery and was left in chronic pain for more than three years because a council failed to move them out of unsuitable housing despite repeated pleas from health professionals, a watchdog has ruled.</p><p>Lambeth council in London was fined £20,000 by the local government and social care ombudsman for a catalogue of service failures and administrative errors that left the child unsafe and in “significant and avoidable distress” and her mother at risk of serious injury.</p><p>Child Y’s constant pain, requiring injections and medication, could be relieved only through surgery, yet this was being delayed because the unsuitability of the family’s home meant Child Y could not safely return after an operation.</p><p>Sitting in the wheelchair for long periods caused so much pain that Child Y’s school had bought a specialist bed in which they would be wheeled around the school to ensure they could access lessons.</p><p>At home, Child Y and her mother were at risk of injury from manual handling because they were unable to use proper equipment. Because of the lack of space, Child Y could not be positioned properly for eating and was at risk of choking.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/apr/13/council-failures-disabled-child-chronic-pain-three-years-watchdog">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Todd Boehly’s belief didn’t last long. Stopped outside the restaurant where directors from these two teams had lunch in the hours before this Champions League quarter-final first leg, the club’s owner had told Chelsea fans: “Have faith, we’re going to win 3-0 tonight.” A prisoner of his words as well as his deeds, within 20 minutes of kick-off, he had been proven wrong, Karim Benzema’s goal giving Madrid the lead. By the time the clock reached ninety, it wasn’t just the game that had escaped them, it might have been the tie.</p><p>Ultimately, that did not surprise much. In fact, although Chelsea had a huge chance three minutes into injury time, Antonio Rüdiger diving in to stop Mason Mount, they might still have been relieved that the deficit is only two – something, however small, to hold on to in the second leg, some tiny glimmer of hope not really born out by what they had seen here. By the end Madrid had racked up 18 shots, Benzema headed the last of them over when he had an open goal. The current European champions were ultimately too good for the previous winners and are well positioned to progress.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/12/real-madrid-chelsea-champions-league-quarter-final-first-leg-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

Like the young Ukrainian men who have just stepped off a plane, we are tossed in and must quickly adjust.</p><p>Dooley lurks on the periphery as the men spend just more than one month trying to learn what new British army recruits would cover in six.

<p>The government has for too long exploited the goodwill of NHS staff to cover for inadequate resources</p><p>The final result of this week’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/apr/11/junior-doctors-in-england-begin-four-day-strike-over-pay" title="">strike by junior doctors</a> cannot be predicted, but some scenarios are likelier than others. It is improbable that the government will accede to the British Medical Association’s call for a 35% pay rise, and it is unlikely that doctors will lose the will to protest without improvement in their working conditions. That leaves a spectrum of compromises that can only be achieved by negotiation, which makes the government’s refusal to talk pointless and, for NHS patients, dangerous.</p><p>The Department of Health and Social Care is approaching the dispute with junior doctors much as it handled industrial action <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/feb/16/next-nurses-strike-to-include-ae-and-intensive-care-units-in-major-escalation" title="">by nurses</a>, which is to say, negligently. The opening gambit is a refusal to engage, in the hope that public opinion will move against the strikers. Ministers also hope for splits in the medical profession, with consultants (whose financial situation is less precarious and whose pension arrangements were ameliorated in the recent budget) withdrawing solidarity from younger colleagues.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/12/the-guardian-view-on-doctors-on-strike-a-symptom-of-a-deeper-crisis">Continue reading...</a>

Even as Covid gripped the world, optimists piped up that <a href="https://bigthink.com/the-present/roaring-twenties-2020s/" title="">the economy would come roaring out of the pandemic</a>, bolstering incomes and kickstarting an almighty boom. Harking back to the Spanish flu pandemic of a century earlier, they saw a decade of glorious growth ahead.</p><p>Well, they were wrong. Ahead lies not roaring but snoring; no boom, but ever-deepening gloom. That is the message from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which are holding their spring meetings in Washington DC this week. In its economic outlook, the IMF not only outlines what a mediocre few years lie ahead, it is also worried that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/apr/11/imf-inflation-financial-stability-world-economic-outlook" title="">things could get even worse</a>. As for the World Bank, it has published a 564-page book whose chief preoccupation is in its title: <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/publication/long-term-growth-prospects" title="">Falling Long-term Growth Prospects</a>. It warns of a “lost decade in the making”, and projects that the meagre growth of the 2010s will “extend into the remainder of the current decade”. We may be less than a third of the way into the 20s but, as far as the serried ranks of the top economists in Washington are concerned, it is already game over.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/12/the-guardian-view-on-the-world-economy-another-bleak-era-beckons">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Dr David Veevers </strong>highlights the important distinction between the dehumanisation of people from west Africa and the treatment of indentured labourers in the colonies</p><p>Robert Godsill (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/11/britains-monarchy-backed-slavery-from-day-one" title="">Letters, 11 April</a>) is right to say that the connection between England’s rulers and slavery goes back further than William III. However, in referring to the Drogheda massacre of 1649 – Oliver Cromwell’s sacking of the city during his invasion to destroy the Irish Confederation – he is wrong to say that the lord protector sent many of the survivors to Barbados as slaves.</p><p>Ireland was the grisly theatre of England’s first colony and the laboratory in which it perfected its strategies of colonial atrocities against civilian populations. The Irish were displaced from their land, suffered through English-engineered famines and massacred on a regular basis, all in the name of English imperialism. Queen Elizabeth’s lord deputy of Ireland, Arthur Chichester, declared that Irish “barbarism gives us cause to think them unworthy of other treatment than to be made perpetual slaves to Her Majesty”. Despite this, while thousands of Irish people were deported to the Caribbean, none were actually enslaved.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/12/irish-people-sent-to-the-caribbean-were-not-enslaved">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Fans are dismayed by the club pulling out of a move for the England star but Liverpool cannot compete financially with UAE and Qatar</p><p>It would have been a summer like no other for Fenway Sports Group had they beaten Europe’s richest clubs to Jude Bellingham and committed in excess of £200m to one Liverpool transfer. Bellingham or not, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/11/liverpool-pull-out-of-race-to-sign-jude-bellingham-from-borussia-dortmund">it’s now not for Liverpool</a>, the pressure has increased on the club’s owners to deliver a summer like no other to prevent a season of regression leaving lasting damage.</p><p>When Jürgen Klopp, in a rare but minor dig at his employers earlier this season, expressed a wish for FSG to take greater risks in the transfer market and act more decisively, pulling out of the race for a long-time leading target in April was presumably not what he had in mind. If the Liverpool manager knew that was the case last Friday, however, when warning that “Whatever we do next year will never be enough from people’s point of view, but with smart recruitment we will improve”, he appeared extremely relaxed about a situation that has dismayed the fanbase.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/12/jude-bellingham-decision-is-a-dose-of-reality-for-liverpool-and-klopp">Continue reading...</a>

## The BBC gazed into the yawning chasm of Elon Musk’s sense of humour – and didn’t find much to envy | Emma Brockes

<p>‘I keep telling you I’m not the CEO of Twitter, my dog is the CEO of Twitter,’ he said. It truly was no-holds-barred stuff</p><p>It is wrong to enjoy the pain of others, unless that person is Elon Musk and the pain is about his purchase of Twitter. In an interview with the BBC reporter James Clayton this week, Musk <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/12/elon-musk-says-bbcs-twitter-tag-will-be-changed-from-government-funded-media">enumerates the ways</a> in which buying Twitter “hasn’t been some kind of party”, describes the thousands of lay-offs at the company as “not fun at all” and puts the pain level of the whole experience at “extremely high”. As interviews with CEOs go, these comments count as immensely revealing, although for me the real takeaway has been that you can be the second richest man in the world and still struggle to find dental veneers that fit.</p><p>Apologies; that was petty. But there is something about the ludicrousness of Musk that triggers the most childish responses. To watch Clayton grapple with him in the last-minute interview – Musk apparently gave the reporter a 20-minute heads up, not a controlling manoeuvre at all – is to witness an almost unmatchably awkward collision between reverence and contempt. The BBC, with its forelock-tugging “just happy to be here” energy (I don’t fault the reporter for this, by the way; there’s an argument that Clayton’s unthreatening demeanour extracted more from Musk than Emily Maitlis would have done), and Musk, working hard to get his reasonable-guy persona off the runway but coming across like a character from an Anthony Trollope novel.</p><p>Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/12/bbc-elon-musk-sense-of-humour-twitter">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sarina Wiegman suffered her first loss in 31 matches in charge of the Lionesses – but what can she alter before the World Cup?</p><p>Critical to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/31/england-germany-womens-euro-2022-final-match-report" title="">England’s success at the Euros</a> last year was the balance between a strong and experienced starting XI and a youthful and hungry bench of substitutes. Match after match the introduction of Manchester United duo Alessia Russo and Ella Toone breathed life into the Lionesses attack. With <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/22/ellen-white-announces-retirement-from-football-england-manchester-city-euro-2022" title="">the retirement of Ellen White</a> and injury to Fran Kirby, Russo and Toone are staples of Sarina Wiegman’s starting XI, but they have left a gaping hole on the bench. Against Australia, three of the four forwards on the bench (Katie Robinson, Jess Park and Lauren James) were not involved in the Euros and they have 18 caps between them. It would be silly to dismiss the potential impact of Park, Robinson and, in particular, James. Each is capable of becoming supersub a la Russo and Toone. The problem is the short turnaround between the Euros and World Cup means we haven’t seen much of them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/12/five-questions-for-wiegmans-england-to-answer-after-defeat-by-australia">Continue reading...</a>

Call it a bi-flat white. Between two old Mochas.</p><p>Whatever it was, it didn’t seem to amount to much. Just a chance for Biden to fill in time before his lunchtime speech. The US president seemed more interested in the view from the hotel window than in the UK prime minister. There’s a grudging respect between the two men, but not a natural connection. Sunak just looked vaguely uncomfortable as he sipped a cup of coffee. There was no way he could spin this as a triumph of statecraft. It wasn’t even as if he and Biden had a great deal to talk about with Stormont still out of action. So they just had to ad lib awkwardly.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/apr/12/sunak-and-bidens-bilat-falls-flat-as-duty-briefly-calls-in-northern-ireland">Continue reading...</a>

Not Jarred Gillett, an Australian once held up as the standard-bearer for how the job should be done after a flamin’ clip of him in action during an A-League game went viral, but who has been embroiled in more than his fair share of controversies since hitching his Ute to the PGMOL wagon. Not the Spanish match officials who have brandished an astonishing 95 red cards in La Liga already this season, compared to the 24 shown by their counterparts in the Premier League. And not the Brazilian fellow who incensed so many English players, pundits, hacks and fans with his performance in the HR World Cup quarter-final against France. No, foreign whistleblowers are contention-proof and we need more of them coming over here, taking our referees’ jobs.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/12/football-daily-polish-match-officials-greece">Continue reading...</a>

## Up all night to get jeté! Thomas Bangalter on hanging up his Daft Punk helmet – and leaping into ballet

<p>Two years after the French funkmeisters unplugged, the electro legend is releasing his first new material – a ballet score. He explains why working with ‘real live humans’ was scary</p><p>On 1 January 2000, childhood friends Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo decided to become robots. For the release of their second album, Discovery, the Daft Punk duo enlisted Hollywood effects designer Tony Gardner to fit them with helmets and articulated gloves, which they would then unveil in a photoshoot for the Face magazine and wear in public unfailingly until their split in 2021.</p><p>Like Discovery – a gilded, chart-bound spaceship built from shreds of 80s pop, funk and metal – the robots offered us a very retro vision of the future. Bangalter, taller, in the silver helmet, was convinced that the human-machine interface had gone haywire. “The difference between reality and fiction is gone,” he told NME in 2001. “You’ve got Photoshop, deformed images, a speech of the president of America that says things he’s never said, animatronics, androids. You can’t believe what you see on television any more.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/12/thomas-bangalter-daft-punk-helmet-leaping-ballet-french-mythologies">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Local commissioners in Memphis will vote today on whether to reappoint Pearson to his seat in state house of representatives</p><p>Good morning, US politics blog readers. <strong>Justin Pearson</strong> was one of two Democratic lawmakers the Tennessee house of representatives expelled last week for holding a noisy protest in favor of gun control, but his exile could end today.

<p>Three years on from my interview with Azeem Rafiq, it’s surreal to see where we and the game have ended up</p><p>Azeem Rafiq sat well outside cricket’s consciousness in July 2020. It had been nearly two years since Yorkshire had let him go for a second time and it took <a href="https://www.thepca.co.uk/press-release/rafiq-opens-matki-chai/">an interview with the Professional Cricketers’ Association</a>, published on their website and probably read by a handful of people, to bring him back into my mind. The subject was a new business Rafiq had opened with his family, a tea shop in Rotherham. While mapping a future outside cricket, he still had ambitions to keep playing.</p><p>I arranged <a href="https://wisden.com/stories/interviews/the-extraordinary-life-of-azeem-rafiq">an interview with Rafiq</a> because I wanted to know how a once trailblazing Yorkshire captain found himself out of professional cricket at 29. We got talking about the players he’d once led for England’s under-19s – Ben Stokes and Joe Root among them – his ambition to become an international coach and, most painfully, the tragedy that had underpinned the last couple of years: the stillbirth of his son. In the wake of George Floyd’s death, I wondered about his experiences as a British Asian making his way at Yorkshire, a side that had once excluded players born outside the county’s boundaries.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/apr/12/yorkshire-racism-saga-cricket-azeem-rafiq-the-spin">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Swedish-Egyptian film-maker behind The Nile Hilton Incident discusses the rewarding reaction to his spy thriller Cairo Conspiracy – and how being a graffiti artist set him free</p><p>When you’re confronted with a truly groundbreaking piece of art, a certain disorientation is sometimes what you experience first. “A lot of journalists ask me: ‘What is real? What is real in this film?’” says the Swedish director Tarik Saleh, suddenly seized by a chuckling fit. “And I think this obsession is because the way the media portrays Muslims is so fictional that when people see a fictional film that portrays al-Azhar [University], they feel like they’ve seen a documentary. And I try to tell them: ‘No, it’s fiction!’”</p><p>He is talking about his new film <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/20/boy-from-heaven-review-cannes-2022">Cairo Conspiracy</a>, so seductive because it appears to give us privileged entry into what has been for most westerners a hitherto invisible world: al-Azhar University in the Egyptian capital, a vast hub of learning and theological wellspring for Sunni Islam. But it’s not the real al-Azhar, as it was all recreated in Turkey, following Saleh’s expulsion from Egypt in 2015 three days before his previous project <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/02/the-nile-hilton-incident-review-fares-fares-tarik-saleh">The Nile Hilton Incident</a> was due to begin shooting. What is real is the outrage the 51-year-old continues to hurl at Egypt’s powers-that-be in this clenched and cowed film.

But every so often – once in a generation, occasionally more if you are lucky – there are those that come along who are a cut above.

She bowed to the 32,000 fans, each and every one showing their appreciation for a player who many see as the most technically capable to play for the national team.

<p>John Lyly’s long-forgotten Galatea – featuring gods, mortals and a highly elastic approach to gender and sex – is being revived at the Brighton festival. We meet the team behind it </p><p>Wickedly funny, astonishingly queer and over 430 years old, John Lyly’s dramatic comedy Galatea upends gender binaries and sheds power structures like they’re merely a change of clothes. Written in the 1580s, the play “gets deep into the DNA of Shakespeare and his contemporaries”, says theatre historian Andy Kesson, but has been largely forgotten.</p><p>This spring, as part of Brighton festival, live artist Emma Frankland is leading a daring outdoor, large-scale production of Galatea that blends academic exploration with queer contemporary performance. Adapted by Frankland and spoken-word artist Subira Joy, and edited by Kesson, this is a collaborative celebration of an under-appreciated play and a reckoning with the way early modern texts are treated – too delicately and exclusively, the team argue. Plus, Frankland says with a cool smile: “We’re going to set shit on fire.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/apr/12/galatea-john-lyly-queer-trans-shakespeares-cross-dressing-brighton-festival">Continue reading...</a>

## Top 10 badly behaved biographies

<p>Life writing is usually a conventional business, but these writers take on the job by discarding the rules, with thrilling results</p><p>Biography is a classic, difficult art, and biographers, those torch-bearers of one of literature’s oldest genres, tend to be scrupulous, detail-oriented obsessives. Yet under rigid control there is often a strange and passionate devotion; they might fall in love with a ghost in order to begin their work, but they have to fall out of love in order to finish it.</p><p>Aspiring biographers have a thousand reasons not to embark on a biography – these books tend to take a decade or more of work and rarely can anyone survive on an advance for that long. But alongside the more or less conventional authors are those biographers who, for whatever reason, meet their task by changing the rules. These slanted, badly behaved books tend to captivate me, which is why I chose to write <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/biography-of-x-9781783789276">a novel in the shape of such a biography</a>. Here are 10 of my favourite such books.<br /><strong><br />1. </strong><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/31/after-kathy-acker-by-chris-kraus-review">After Kathy Acker by Chris Kraus</a></strong><br />Kraus admits outright that this biography of Acker may not, in fact, be a biography and I would argue that it is, but also that it isn’t – regardless, I couldn’t put it down. Kraus had a front row seat to Acker’s antics and her crowd in a version of New York that only exists now in shadow and legend. After Kathy Acker is as much a book about a scene and a moment as it is about one woman in the midst of it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/12/top-10-badly-behaved-biographies-catherine-lacey-biography-of-x">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After decades of offensively terrible video game adaptations, I’m more than happy to settle for one that is simply OK</p><p>I don’t think I’ve ever been to see a film on its opening day – but I made the effort for the Super Mario Bros Movie last week. Using my six-year-old as a convenient excuse to see a children’s movie in the middle of the day, I sat in a suspiciously quiet cinema and tried to keep a handle on my trepidation. The reviews had come out the day before, and they <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/04/the-super-mario-bros-movie-review-wackily-eccentric-gamer-guys-fall-flat-on-screen">weren’t</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/09/the-super-mario-bros-movie-review-game-over-for-this-lazy-animated-mess">good</a>. I anticipated spending the next 90 minutes feeling bitterly disappointed that, yet again, Hollywood had screwed up a golden opportunity to bring a beloved game to the big screen.</p><p>Perhaps my expectations were just exceedingly low – I have, after all, suffered through 30 years of offensively terrible movie adaptations of video games, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/dec/02/from-tron-to-jumanji-the-greatest-ever-movies-about-video-games">with only the occasional reprieve</a> – but I thought it was <em>fine. </em>It’s not as surreal and funny as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/03/pokemon-detective-pikachu-review-ryan-reynolds-grabs-film-by-scruff-of-the-neck">Detective Pikachu</a>, nor as creative as the video-game-inspired <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/feb/07/wreck-it-ralph-review">Wreck-it Ralph</a> or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/aug/05/free-guy-review-ryan-reynolds-taika-waititi-jodie-comer-video-game">Free Guy</a>, but it looked right, sounded right, and didn’t labour the nostalgia too much. Plenty of critics have characterised the film as a lazy and meaningless sequence of empty references – and, yes, it suffers from a distinct absence of plot – but how much narrative justification do we actually need for a trip down Rainbow Road in go-karts? (Side note: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiIRlg4Xr5w">a Mad Max/Mario Kart mashup road battle</a> was <em>not</em> something I was expecting from this film.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/apr/12/pushing-buttons-super-mario-bros-movie">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This eye-opening analysis of the British way of governing reveals a system set up for failure</p><p>Ian Dunt starts his lacerating analysis of Westminster with an extended case history. It concerns <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/chrisgrayling" title="">Chris Grayling </a>at the time he became secretary of state for justice in 2012. Having inherited a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/09/the-guardian-view-on-the-probation-service-a-crunch-has-been-building-for-years" title="">probation service</a> that was creaking at the seams, he decided to privatise the whole thing, turning over the delicate business of managing ex-offenders to a selection of security firms that had no experience of that kind of work. The big idea was that they would be incentivised with a “payment by results” system, calculated according to how many people fell back into crime.</p><p>What followed can best be described as a fiasco. The firms had no insight into the many causes of recidivism. Some clients simply got lost in the system because payment by results was not conducive to careful record-keeping across different agencies. It is perhaps consoling to know that several of the private companies that signed up for the promised unlimited profits ended up bankrupt. And Grayling? He went on to transport, where he acquired the moniker “Failing Grayling”. Ian Dunt, though, thinks this is unfair, since Grayling is actually “a completely standard example of the quality of the ministerial class in Britain”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/12/how-westminster-works-and-why-it-doesnt-by-ian-dunt-review-a-savage-indictment-of-the-status-quo">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Scorsese’s brutally nihilist biopic of the self-hating, self-sabotaging middleweight champion remains full of despairing beauty and unforgettable performances</p><p>No matter how many times I see it, I know its hardest punch is coming at the very end and I am helplessly leading with my chin. Director Martin Scorsese flashes up a quotation from John 9:24-26, its verses individually illuminated in succession: “So for the second time, the Pharisees summoned the man who had been blind and said: / ‘Speak the truth before God. We know this fellow is a sinner.’ / ‘Whether or not he is a sinner, I do not know,’ the man replied / ‘All I know is this: once I was blind and now I can see.’”</p><p>But has redemption really finally come for Jake LaMotta – the corrupt, self-hating, self-sabotaging and not especially repentant boxer so unforgettably played by Robert De Niro in Scorsese’s 1980 classic Raging Bull, incandescent with monochrome beauty. LaMotta ends his days without reconciliation with his wife whom he abused, without reconciliation with his longsuffering brother Joey (an equally unforgettable performance from Joe Pesci). The final act comes with his blandly sentimental, self-congratulatory nightclub act in which this bloated, ruined figure is simply pleased to have survived, as uninterested in moral judgment as the blind man who refuses to condemn Jesus.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/12/raging-bull-review-still-packs-a-punch-like-no-boxing-movie-before-or-since">Continue reading...</a>

## The trauma doctor: Gabor Maté on happiness, hope and how to heal our deepest wounds

<p>The physician, author and self-help guru came to worldwide prominence when he appeared with Prince Harry last month. He discusses the mind-body connection, the reality of addiction and why trauma can be treated</p><p>Gabor Maté was arriving at Vancouver airport one day when his phone lit up with a text from his wife, Rae. She asked if he still wanted a lift home, and mentioned she hadn’t yet left their house. The physician, mental health expert and bestselling author, who was 71 at the time, replied brusquely: “Never mind.” So enraged was he, as Maté writes in his new book, The Myth of Normal: Trauma, Illness &amp; Healing in a Toxic Culture, that, when he got home, he “growled a hello” and then “barely made eye contact” for the next day. “Is this the response of a mature adult in his eighth decade?” he asks.</p><p>This kind of candour about his failings has won him fans for his work on trauma, addiction, attention deficit disorder (ADD), stress and childhood development, but it is the wisdom he squeezes from it that has made him a self-help guru for some. With more than 1.4 million followers on Instagram, he has an impact on people akin to that of a rock star, but a cerebral one – more Leonard Cohen or Joni Mitchell than Justin Bieber (his husky drawl would sound almost as good narrating the lyrics to I’m Your Man).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/12/the-trauma-doctor-gabor-mate-on-happiness-hope-and-how-to-heal-our-deepest-wounds">Continue reading...</a>

## I want to feel proud of being an NHS doctor, but the job is so difficult now. I’m not sure I’d want my daughter to do this | Nish Manek

<p>If I think about the pressure, the erosion in working conditions and the declining level of pay, so much would have to change</p><p>“Mummy, I want to be a doctor”. Is this simple role play, or a genuine career intention from my three-year-old? I look down at her playing with her doctor’s set and teddy bear, and I want to feel proud. But I realise something has changed. Getting some headspace on maternity leave, watching the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/11/junior-doctors-strike-pay-nhs-corridors">junior doctor discontent</a> bubble up again and seeing my husband quit his neurology registrar job for an infinitely happier career in research have all contributed to my unease.</p><p>Perhaps we should have known what we signed up for. I’ve heard senior doctors mutter that things were much harder for them, and our generation of snowflakes needs to be more resilient. But when you’re 17, how can you really know what you’re committing to for your lifetime? You’ve earned good grades, you want to make your family proud, and there is an element of vocation, challenge and nobility attached to medicine that is hard to ignore. You’re reverent of the senior doctors you meet on work experience. They are respected by their patients, proud of their contributions and live a relatively stable, comfortable life.</p><p>Nish Manek is an NHS GP, podcaster and blogger</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/12/nhs-doctor-pressure-working-conditions-pay-strike">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The basketball legend whose legal case improved the landscape for generations of young stars may finally be getting his due in history with a forthcoming biopic</p><p>Spencer Haywood was standing in the Cincinnati snow, freezing his butt off. The stylish green and gold bellbottom Seattle SuperSonics warmups he wore did little for the cold wind, which would blow up the thighs thanks to the wide ankle hem. The short-sleeve top didn’t help much, either. The 1970s had just begun but Haywood’s career, remarkable as it was, as a former ABA Rookie of the Year and MVP, had stalled again. But for the future multi-time All-Star, who later dealt with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oq97XhfggXM">substance abuse issues</a> while in the NBA with the Los Angeles Lakers, he wasn’t standing in the sub-freezing night because of any personal or professional infraction. No, he was in the process of changing the league forever. As such, he wasn’t even allowed to stand on the Cincinnati Royals court, opposite Tiny Archibald and Norm Van Lier, or go back into the locker room and get his street clothes. He was an “illegal player” and banned from the game before it started because, simply, he was in court fighting a bigger battle.</p><p>“‘We’ve got an illegal player on the floor,’ <em>blah-blah-blah</em>,” Haywood tells the Guardian, remembering back to his first year in the NBA with the SuperSonics. “There was <em>another</em> injunction against me. So, they put me out into the snow.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/apr/12/spencer-haywood-nba-star-biopic-supreme-court-case">Continue reading...</a>

<p>London life after Grenfell is powerfully portrayed in this sequel-of-sorts to Ordinary People</p><p>Barack Obama’s 2008 election victory gave a jubilant opening to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/25/diana-evans-the-tory-rhetoric-asks-us-to-forget-im-trying-to-make-sure-that-we-dont" title="">Diana Evans</a>’s third novel, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/11/ordinary-people-diana-evans-review-couples-marital-angst-black-mixed-race" title="">Ordinary People</a>; the horrific <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/grenfell-tower-fire" title="">Grenfell</a> tragedy begins the sequel-of-sorts, A House for Alice. The blaze is described as “a massacre by negligence, a criminal activity, a corporate atrocity, an obliteration of families”. Evans imagines the fire with a righteous rage rarely seen in British contemporary fiction. The narration is nobly elegiac, too, envisioning in the flames “families rich in entireties of love [...] wars remembered and seas remembered and sections of homework completed and others pending, and rows of dolls in children’s bedrooms […] and rivers of futures flowing through shared water pipes […] and mothers lying on their sides with headscarves on and their eyelids moist and warm and gently flickering”. It’s a sequence of startling grace and directness.</p><p>The choice to position alongside the recollection of this fire a fictional blaze that happens on the same night might surprise – perhaps even unnerve – readers. This second fire is at the Kilburn home of Cornelius Pitt, estranged father of Melissa, one of the characters in Ordinary People. His death brings Melissa’s mother, Alice, back to a nagging ache. Alice wants to build a house in Nigeria, the place she left to come to the UK half a century ago. She wants to return to “the red-flecked paths of Benin City, with the voices of the air being her own kind of voice, the loneliness and exclusion of foreignness erased”. She wants to go back to her motherland, leaving her children and grandchildren in London, to see out the final part of her life. It’s moving to find the thinking and desires of often overlooked older African women beautifully attended to in this part of the novel. The dignity and seriousness with which Evans characterises the quietly sagacious Alice call to mind strands of Bernardine Evaristo’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/08/girl-woman-other-by-bernardine-evaristo-review" title="">Girl, Woman, Other</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/12/a-house-for-alice-by-diana-evans-review-a-follow-up-with-fire-and-fury">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A remarkable meditation on friendship, success, madness and violence that refuses to oversimplify </p><p>There’s a feeling you get rewatching a movie that ends in disaster. A hope against hope that this time the hero will cheat fate; that the captain of the Titanic’s desperate attempts to swerve the iceberg will pay off. Maybe that tear in the hull isn’t as bad as it looks? Though the jacket of The Best Minds, novelist Jonathan Rosen’s extraordinary account of his friend Michael Laudor’s mental illness, speaks only of a “horrific act” committed by its subject, readers are well aware that something dreadful is coming. It is testament to the author’s ability to immerse us in the world he builds that this doesn’t stop us from willing a different outcome, feeling that every success might just stick, and each calamity could in fact be a temporary setback. In doing so we mirror the reactions of those around Laudor at the time, from friends to teachers to the titans of media and Hollywood – reactions that arguably helped seal his fate and that of his fiancee, Carrie Costello.</p><p>To say that this is a memoir, a case study, or a book about schizophrenia is to dramatically undersell it. Though Rosen’s lens is particular, his view is panoptic. This is a magisterial work, as much a sociological study of late 20th-century America as it is a book about madness. It is also a book about childhood and friendship, the long shadow of the second world war and its unexpected intellectual legacy, about ambition and delusion and the danger of stories. Despite weighing in at more than 500 pages, the narrative scarcely drags thanks to Rosen’s style, which is easygoing, but spiced with moments of pin-sharp brilliance.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/12/the-best-minds-by-jonathan-rosen-review-when-hope-fails">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Trump’s only child with Marla Maples seems to have gone from avoiding the spotlight to being her father’s biggest fan</p><p>Well, it looks like Melaniawatch is officially over. The former first lady has a habit of periodically <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/01/politics/melania-trump-camp-david/index.html">disappearing</a>, sparking fanciful theories that she has left her philandering husband and is crashing at the Obamas’ mansion to write a <a href="https://people.com/politics/snopes-ceo-melania-trump-conspiracy-theories/">tell-all.</a> Her latest vanishing act came, understandably, after Trump was arrested last week for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/10/trump-lawyer-jim-trusty-defense-strategy">hush money payments</a> to the adult film star Stormy Daniels. Melania was conspicuously absent from Trump’s arraignment and he failed to mention her in a speech where he thanked his entire family, and – bizarrely – praised his son Barron for being very tall. Like Jesus, however, Melania made a public reappearance on Easter Sunday.</p><p>As soon as the where-is-Melania speculation was laid to rest, the what’s-Tiffany-up-to conjecture started. Eyebrows were raised when Trump thanked Tiffany, his youngest daughter, in his post-arraignment speech, because Trump famously has a habit of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/03/tiffany-trump-flying-like-a-bird-above-the-hurtful-rumours">forgetting that Tiffany exists.</a> Her siblings reportedly aren’t much kinder. According to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/08/michael-cohen-releases-book-disloyal-trump-racism-toxic-family-dynamic">Michael Cohen’s memoir</a> about his time as Trump’s lapdog, Donald Jr, Eric and Ivanka (Trump’s children with his first wife, Ivana Trump) referred to Tiffany, who Trump fathered with his second wife, Marla Maples, as the “red-haired stepchild”. Cohen also claims the former president and Ivanka were rude about Tiffany’s looks.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/12/after-ivanka-trumps-strategic-exit-is-tiffany-the-new-first-daughter">Continue reading...</a>

I share ownership of my flat with housing association L&amp;Q, which took nearly four years to survey the block to ensure fire safety compliance. It found it may not meet current safety guidelines (the estate was built by </strong><strong>Rydon</strong><strong>, which led the refurbishment of Grenfell). Further inspections are needed and remediation work on the estate won’t start until 2025 at the earliest.</strong></p><p><strong>Since my block is only four storeys, it’s likely to be one of the last on the estate to be addressed, so it could take years more. This leaves residents unable to sell or staircase their ownership share. In the meantime I am faced with inflation-busting rent and service charge increases for a property that is essentially worthless, not to mention the potential costs of remedial works. And because the building is below 11 metres high, it is not eligible for the government’s building safety fund.</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/apr/12/were-trapped-by-the-cladding-scandal-and-cant-find-a-way-out">Continue reading...</a>

## I was used as a scapegoat when Baby P died – Sunak’s attacks on social workers are dangerous | Sharon Shoesmith

<p>I lost my job and was vilified in the media. Social workers must stand up against baseless accusations</p><ul><li>Sharon Shoesmith is a former director of education and children’s social care</li></ul><p>Harm to children and young people seems to be reported almost daily in the media – from the renewed interest in so-called grooming gangs, to<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/21/logan-mwangi-mother-stepfather-and-unnamed-teen-found-guilty-of"> tragic cases such as that of Logan Mwangi</a> that horrify the entire UK for weeks at a time. These cases shock and disturb us, but when it comes to blaming someone, social workers can be painted as incompetent or unwilling to act to prevent harm to children. Rishi Sunak <a href="https://www.basw.co.uk/resources/psw-magazine/psw-online/pm-criticised-offensive-comments-about-social-workers">recently claimed</a> social workers often “ignore” sexual abuse when it is reported to them. Prof Andrew Cooper suggests that the pain of knowing that children are harmed is too great to bear, and the perceived incompetence of social workers functions as a defence for society against having to tolerate this horrifying knowledge.</p><p>Names of children tragically killed by a known adult live on in our memories and populate images in the media. The case of Peter Connelly (known as Baby P) in Haringey, which came to public attention in 2008, is probably the best known. I was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/dec/01/baby-p-childprotection1">sacked from my position</a> as Haringey’s director of<strong> </strong>education and children’s services by<strong> </strong>the then secretary of state for children, Ed Balls, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/may/27/sharon-shoesmith-court-win-baby-p">on live TV</a>. This was less than a month after Peter’s mother, her boyfriend and her boyfriend’s brother were convicted of “causing or allowing” his death. I was closely followed by four social workers and a paediatrician from Great Ormond Street children’s hospital (GOSH). The scapegoating and vilification of me and other social workers in this case and others has had many unintended consequences.</p><p>Sharon Shoesmith is a former director of education and children’s social care, now working as a writer, researcher and public speaker.

<p>Britain’s 2.7 million greys are on the rampage, starting fires, flooding homes and destroying ancient trees. But is it really right to kill and eat them?</p><p>‘This poor lady didn’t close her loft hatch properly and the squirrel got into the flat,” recalls John Silby, a 58-year-old pest controller. “She thought she’d been burgled. The telly was off the wall, plates were smashed, furniture was ripped. We put traps in. When we went back and opened the door, we could smell dead rodent. But the traps hadn’t gone off.”</p><p>Silby’s grey squirrel stories have the urgency, mystery and gore of a Sherlock Holmes tale. Once, one of his colleagues was bitten by a squirrel, whose massive incisors went through his thumbnail and out the other side. Silby couldn’t get the animal off, because it was locked on and wriggling, so he had to decapitate it, then wrap the thumb – and the squirrel’s head<em> – </em>in a bandage to take his colleague to A&amp;E.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/12/the-secret-lives-of-grey-squirrels-the-telly-was-off-the-wall-plates-were-smashed-furniture-was-ripped">Continue reading...</a>
