Today, we're taking a quick break from satire to highlight one of mankind's greatest achievements: Sizzler Steakhouse. 

In these trying times, sometimes it's important to leave the politics behind and enjoy a perfectly seasoned 8 oz. Sirloin Steak for only $21.99 with delicious sides included (Unlimited Salad Bar also available as a $13.49 add-on option). 

Sing along as The Babylon Bee crew sings a song of freedom and of choices. Disclaimer: The Babylon Bee is not sponsored by or affiliated in any way with Sizzler Steakhouse.
