Meaning, California will allow young <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/prisha-mosley-texas\" target=\"_blank\">gender-confused children</a> to travel to the state and pay thousands of dollars for, ahem,  \"gender-affirming medical care,\" if they live in a state where such \"care\" is outlawed. </p><p>One center providing such \"medical care\" is Rady Children's Hospital. Rady has a Center for Gender-Affirming Care that <a href=\"https://www.rchsd.org/programs-services/gender-affirming-care/services/\" target=\"_blank\">treats children, adolescents and young adults</a> with gender dysphoria with surgical referrals, hair-removal referrals, gender-affirming vocal therapy, and more. </p><p>Megan Brock, a parental rights advocate active on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MegEBrock\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>, highlighted this promotional ad for the Rady Center's youth services. It features numerous child patients who transitioned with the help of the center. One former patient, a biological female, proudly shows off her double mastectomy scars. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cA clip from a video promoting @radychildrens Center for Gender Affirming care. \\n\\nIt includes a girl who transitioned to a boy who proudly shows her double mastectomy scars. \\n\\nThe clinics director says, \\u201cMany parents want to do the right thing and there is a lot of fear.\\u201d\\n\\n\\ud83d\\udc94\\ud83d\\udc94\\ud83d\\udc94\\u201d</div> \u2014 Megan Brock (@Megan Brock)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MegEBrock/status/1645902959291641857\">1681248819</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Clinic Director Bixby Marino-Kibbee said, \"I think it's something that feels daunting for parents. Many parents want to do the right thing and there is a lot of fear, and they're scared, they just want their kid to grow up to live a happy, healthy life.\" Which is absolutely true. But many clinics capitalize on this fear and tell parents their children will commit suicide if they don't transition, as they did to de-transitioner Chloe Cole. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cMy testimony against SB107 in front of Wiener and the Senate Judiciary Committee.\\u201d</div> \u2014 Chloe Cole \\u2b50\\ufe0f (@Chloe Cole \\u2b50\\ufe0f)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChoooCole/status/1565356240598810633\">1662044985</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Kibbee went on to explain that the protective factor for their adolescent patients is a family that is supportive of their transition, which the Rady Center seeks to facilitate from the beginning. </p><p>There is no mention in the ad of anyone asking the child if they are sure about their life-altering decision, or if the child is even old enough to <em>make</em> such a decision. No one seems concerned about that detail. The adults are so concerned with \"affirmation,\" it seems they don't even pause to <em>consider</em> it might not be the right choice. </p><p>How many children grow up and, like Chloe Cole, regret their transition only when it's too late? We don't know. The other side claims it's a tiny proportion, but there's literally no way of knowing. De-transitioners often say they are completely ostracized from the community once they express their regret. So something tells me the powers-that-be aren't all that interested in including them in any statistical studies. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Lily is a Zoomer college dropout who somehow landed a writing gig here at LwC.com.

Regarding the DIY bleaching trend, Liew said, \"There are cases where use of the wrong concentration of bleach has killed the tooth and when that happens you end in pain and usually require root canal therapy.\"</p><p>Though dentists can use bleach when whitening teeth, the Therapeutic Goods Association controls the levels of bleach used by dentists for safety. Hydrogen peroxide is only safe for teeth in very small doses. Dr. Jeffrey Kho, another Australian dentist, said one of the worst trends he's seen is people attempting to clean their own gums with a scaler hook purchased online, which causes damage to gums, recession, and sensitivity.</p><p>My friends, I think this goes without saying but...please don't drink bleach.

Just chillin'. </p><p>The footage showed three separate fights, including two between two girls, and one between several students whose identities were completely redacted. Footman denied that she organized the fights, but admitted she failed to intervene, call for help, or report the fights. Likely since she was caught on camera doing so. </p><p>But the students who were involved in the fights told investigators the fights were in fact pre-planned and that Footman allowed them to take place in her classroom.

I cannot fathom what overtakes a person, especially a young woman, to do something so cruel and evil. And why were these women in this line of work at all of they hated it so much? They <em>clearly</em> do not have a passion for healthcare work. There are plenty of other jobs out there that don't require the high level of compassion needed for jobs like this.  Unfortunately, I suspect a huge contributing factor to abuse like this is understaffing. Perhaps better vetting of employees is needed to ensure these horrific instances of abuse don't happen.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Lily is a Zoomer college dropout who somehow landed a writing gig here at LwC.com.

Clayton then deflected to other organizations that have said there is more hateful content. To which Musk asked for an example. To which Clayton had none. </p><p>After Musk pointed out that Clayton had said something false by claiming to see hateful content, Clayton tried to change the topic to \"<a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/whitmer-gardening-cnn\" target=\"_blank\">COVID</a> misinformation\". But Musk wouldn't let him get away with it, and asked him about the BBC's COVID misinformation. </p><p>This guy definitely did not know what he was getting into when he stepped into the arena with Musk.

This is why we have the saying \"eat a dick.\"</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"c55c1\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33452316&amp;width=980\" />\n</p>\n<p>But dig further, Rick Scott actually PASSED gun control laws that Hogg wants to be passed. Scott was the Florida governor during the Parkland tragedy where he, per the New York Times,  BROKE WITH THE NRA and signed gun control measures into law <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/florida-red-flag-law\" target=\"_blank\">like red flag laws</a> and <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/fl-gov-scott-raises-gun-purchasing-age-21\" target=\"_blank\">raising the age to buy a firearm to 21</a>.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">Again, there is no incentive to pay attention or negotiate with the gun control activists. Especially when they behave like ghouls trying to dunk on people suffering loss. <br /><br />Rick Scott did what they wanted after Parkland and they still respond to him like this. <a href=\"https://t.co/6xBK7Uvq63\">pic.twitter.com/6xBK7Uvq63</a><br />\u2014 AG (@AGHamilton29) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AGHamilton29/status/1645791177910915072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 11, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>This is why you don't negotiate with gun control terrorists. It's never enough. </p><p>But more maddening is that after Hogg was scumbag enough to blame Scott for his friend being murdered, he had the audacity to tweet this:</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">To be honest I think it might be social media more than anything that prevents us on making progress on addressing gun violence together- because it kills all nuance and only polarizes people more.

Why? Because that senator has a different opinion than you on gun rights. EVEN THOUGH, that senator has found common ground with you on gun control before.</p><p>You are a shit person.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.

It's a perfect example of why I say <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/stephen-a-smith-trump\" target=\"_blank\">conservative primary voters need to hold Trump to standards and think long and hard about the general election</a>. Donald Trump, who is running to be the presidential nominee for the GOP, sings the praises of California's progressive globalist governor Gavin Newsom. Because Gavin said nice things about him.</p><p><strong>CONTEXT MATTERS.</strong> Prior to this clip, Trump said a lot of conservative things that Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, and Vivek Ramaswamy (and starting today, Tim Scott) also say. Trump also said of Gavin. \"You have a very ambitious guy in California but he's done a terrible job with the state.\" </p><p>Keep that context in mind. Also, keep in mind the context of if <strong>ANY OTHER REPUBLICAN</strong> said that and then followed up with this:</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">TRUMP: \"I used to get along great with\" Gavin Newsom!\"<br /><br />TUCKER: \"Wait, you got along with Gavin Newsom?!\"<br /><br />TRUMP: \"He was always very nice to me.

If DeSantis ever said this exact same thing of Gavin Newsom -- <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/gavin-newsom-florida-ad\" target=\"_blank\">who is pro-abortion, anti-gun, pro-lockdowns, anti-energy independence, pro-eliminating fossil fuels while also limiting when people can charge their electric cars, pro-illegal immigration, pro-genital mutilation, anti-protecting girls' sports, and pro-sexualizing children in public schools</a> -- DeSantis would not be my guy anymore. He would go in time out.</p><p>Newsom is also touring America not only attacking Ron DeSantis (something he and Trump are brothers-in-arms over) but attacking every conservative reform we have fought for over the past few years. That's the guy who Trump has always gotten along with because Newsom would blow smoke up his ass.</p><blockquote>\"That's why I could never hit [Newsom] because he was so nice to me.\"</blockquote><p>All it would take is for Democrats to pull their heads out of their asses and instead of attacking Trump or sending the feds after him, start saying nice things about Trump. Run commercials on Fox News \"only someone as handsome as Trump would have a big enough brain to legalize abortion on demand and socialize the healthcare industry.\"</p><p>Conservatives will be making a huge mistake if they don't take advantage of the primary. And not just settle for the guy who says it's his turn and he deserves it.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.
