Now, that feature is changing soon&mdash;although you don&rsquo;t have to let it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this month, Microsoft began pushing Build 22624.1546 to the Windows Insider Beta Channel&mdash;the channel for changes that <em>will</em> come to your PC sometime in the future. That build changes the behavior of the <strong>PrtScn</strong> button. Instead of triggering the Print Screen function, it opens the Snipping Tool app instead by default.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be fair, the Snipping Tool app is quite flexible. It doesn&rsquo;t offer the one-click functionality of <strong>PrtScn</strong>, but the tool does offer a full-screen snip capability, just like the legacy shortcut. It also offers the ability to &ldquo;snip&rdquo; whatever&rsquo;s in your current window, the entire screen, or a custom region. Microsoft even plans on adding the ability to <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1430275/windows-snipping-tool-will-add-screen-recording.html\">record video clips from the Snipping Tool</a>, so you&rsquo;ll be able to record a small video of how to do something&hellip; like a screen snip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What you may not know is that this functionality is already live in Windows 11, which <em>also</em> allows you to turn it off. If you enter the Windows Settings menu, you should see <em>Accessibility</em>, then <em>Keyboard</em>. There&rsquo;s a specific option to &ldquo;Use the Print screen button to open screen snipping.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s most likely off by default.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Windows 11 Snipping tool screen recorder\" class=\"wp-image-1430290\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Windows-Snipping-tool-screen-recorder-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"782\" /><figcaption>In the future, here&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll see when you hit the &ldquo;Print Screen&rdquo; key.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Microsoft</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft says that it will preserve that preference even when the new functionality is pushed to Windows users sometime in the future. We suspect that won&rsquo;t be the case, but at least you know how to adjust it once it does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, is the traditional <strong>PrtScn</strong> or &ldquo;Print Screen&rdquo; function is going away? Probably not. On our test machine (a Microsoft Surface, which generally reflects Microsoft&rsquo;s changes), the &ldquo;Print Screen&rdquo; function still works, although there&rsquo;s no &ldquo;flash&rdquo; to indicate that it does. Simply opening Paint and pasting onto the canvas using <strong>CTRL-V</strong>, however, works just fine.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Windows 11 print screen settings\" class=\"wp-image-1784294\" height=\"932\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Print-screen-settings.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Want to prevent Print Screen from opening the Snipping Tool?

According to the agreement, announced Wednesday by both companies, the deal will first focus on mobile SoCs for smartphones and tablets, and then expand into automotive, embedded products for the so-called Internet of Things, then data centers, aerospace, and government. Exact terms were not announced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Intel-Arm deal doesn&rsquo;t involve Intel&rsquo;s Client Computing Group (CCG), which designs the Core processors used in PCs and desktops. Instead, it&rsquo;s an extension of<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/394293/intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-pledges-a-return-to-greatness-through-chip-design.html\"> Intel&rsquo;s new foundry business</a>, established in 2021 as a way to spur Intel&rsquo;s development of manufacturing technology but also provide an important new revenue stream. Intel essentially &ldquo;walls off&rdquo; its foundry services from the rest of its business, protecting the intellectual property of its customers. While <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/394297/intel-will-build-x86-chips-for-other-companies.html\">Intel will also license and sell its own X86 chip designs</a> to those customers, a company like Arm can also choose to simply treat Intel as a manufacturing line like TSMC. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outsourcing chip production to an outside company is typical in today&rsquo;s chip world, with Intel being a notable exception. Nvidia, like Arm, also uses foundries to manufacture its chips. The difference is that Arm adds another layer: customers like Qualcomm and Samsung who can opt to use a chip foundry if they choose. It is those companies that will have additional freedom to do just that, according to the deal; instead of relying on a company like TSMC, the Intel-Arm agreement allows them to manufacture an Arm processor on Intel&rsquo;s own manufacturing lines.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Intel manufacturing roadmap\" class=\"wp-image-1784246\" height=\"674\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Intel-18A-roadmap.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Intel showed off its manufacturing roadmap two years ago.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Intel</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Specifically, Arm customers will have access to Intel&rsquo;s 18A process technology, which Intel said last year is scheduled to come on line in 2024 for Intel&rsquo;s own PC processors, its Xeon line, and foundry customers as well. Intel has highlighted two technologies as critical for its 18A process: PowerVia power delivery and RibbonFET, a gate-all-around technology. (Both were originally slated for Intel&rsquo;s earlier 20A technology.) The importance of RibbonFET, or gate-all-around technology, is that it allows chip designers to start building up, in three dimensions, rather than just a flat two-dimensional chip. PowerVia complements that by shifting how Intel routes power throughout the chip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intel can also hypothetically provide an Arm customer with additional innovations in packaging and chiplets. The latter is considered to be significant, as it allows designers to package together smaller chip logic on individual dice inside a larger package. Traditionally, all of that logic would be manufactured on the same process technology. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chiplets allow a chip designer to mix and match, so that they can ask different companies to fabricate logic, connecting them and packaging them all together at the final stage. Hypothetically, this would allow an Arm licensee to more quickly tweak, manufacture, and ship Arm processors. Arm and Intel will work together to co-optimize Arm&rsquo;s designs for Intel&rsquo;s own chip design and process methodology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;There is growing demand for computing power driven by the digitization of everything, but until now fabless customers have had limited options for designing around the most advanced mobile technology,&rdquo; said Pat Gelsinger, Intel&rsquo;s chief executive, in a statement. &ldquo;Intel&rsquo;s collaboration with Arm will expand the market opportunity for IFS and open up new options and approaches for any fabless company that wants to access best-in-class CPU IP and the power of an open system foundry with leading-edge process technology.&rdquo;</p>\n\nCPUs and Processors</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1784223/intel-will-likely-make-your-next-phones-chip.html", "date_published": "2023-04-12 16:54:39+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "IronVest review: Protection beyond password management", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n<div class=\"review\" id=\"review-body\"><span class=\"review-title\">At a glance</span><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"experts-rating\">Expert's Rating</h3><div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n<div><div class=\"review-columns\"><div class=\"review-column\"><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"pros\">Pros</h3><ul class=\"pros review-list\"><li>Manages login credentials</li><li>Hides email addresses and credit card numbers</li><li>Blocks trackers</li></ul></div><div class=\"review-column\"><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"cons\">Cons</h3><ul class=\"cons review-list\"><li>Requires paid subscription to unlock advanced features</li><li>Some features still in beta</li></ul></div></div></div><h3 class=\"review-subTitle review-subTitle--borderTop\" id=\"our-verdict\">Our Verdict</h3><p class=\"verdict\">IronVest&rsquo;s privacy service is a great option for shopping more securely in an increasingly risky online environment.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>A simple scroll through your social media feed will reveal how willingly people give away intimate information. Oversharing can result in more than cringe-inducing posts&mdash;it can have significant security implications when enterprising advertisers, scammers, and cybercriminals can analyze that information for personal details. But you can curb your impulse to overshare in a social media setting. When you shop at an online retailer, however, you have no choice but to share your credit card number, email, home address, and a raft of other identifying data. Unless you use IronVest, that is.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>Further reading:</strong> See our roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407092/best-password-managers-reviews-and-buying-advice.html\">best password managers</a> to learn about competing products.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-ironvest\">What is IronVest?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>IronVest is a privacy service that goes beyond password management to provide features such as email and credit-card masking and tracking prevention. A free account lets you manage passwords for all your accounts, autofill identity profiles and credit cards, block trackers, and mask three email addresses. IronVest&rsquo;s Plus plan syncs across devices, and adds masked credit cards, masked phone numbers, and enhanced biometric 2FA protection for $5.95 a month or $39 a year. Note that each masked credit-card use costs an additional $2 to cover transaction-handling costs. The Ultimate plan adds unlimited masked email addresses and gives you the first two masked credit cards fee-free for $14.95 per month or $99 a year. There&rsquo;s a 30-day free trial for the premium plans.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"ironvest-features\">IronVest features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To get started with IronVest, you just need to sign up online and create a master password. This password provides access to your account and protects all your saved login credentials and other personal data, so it should be longer and stronger than what you might typically create for an online service. Once you verify your account with an emailed code, IronVest provides you with a backup passphrase. This is a string of 12 random words you can use to recover all your saved passwords if you forget your master password. IronVest doesn&rsquo;t store your backup passphrase with your other credentials but rather tells you to write it down and store it in a safe place. IronVest also gives you the option at this point to enable facial biometric authentication.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>IronVest goes the extra mile by not only managing your passwords but also masking any identifying data that gets shared when you&rsquo;re shopping online. </p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"IronVest\" class=\"wp-image-1683007\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IronVest-Masked-email.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>You can create and manage masked emails for all your online accounts so vendors don&rsquo;t see your actual email address.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Ansaldo/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>After completing this setup, the IronVest dashboard loads and immediately prompts you to install the IronVest browser extension. Like other popular password managers, the extension puts a small button on your browser&rsquo;s toolbar. Pressing it opens a small panel that allows you to perform various functions on the current website, including creating a new masked account or auto-filling existing masked addresses, credit card numbers, and so on. You can access your full dashboard by clicking the IronVest icon in the upper left of the panel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The dashboard includes tiles for seven areas: Access Guard, Identity, Privacy, Pay, Tracking Crypto, and Phishing. Each tile includes one or two buttons that provide access to information in that area. Access Guard, for example, is where you manage your login credentials and passcodes, and Identity is where you manage your snail-mail addresses and identity profiles. The layout is fairly intuitive, but IronVest includes a quick start guide on the dashboard that you can use at any time to get some some wizard-style instruction on masking credit cards, protecting passwords, and other features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Password management in IronVest is similar to other products. You can import login credentials from 1Password, Bitwarden, Dashlane, LastPass, KeePass, Nord Pass, RoboForm, and True Key, as well as from the Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, Opera, and Brave browsers. You can also import from a CSV file from a service not listed here, but you&rsquo;ll have to manually match columns with the proper fields.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"IronVest\" class=\"wp-image-1683008\" height=\"660\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IronVest-Masked-Cards.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>IronVest can mask your credit card information before submitting it to vendors.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Ansaldo/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Capture and replay work as expected. When you access a secure website for the first time, IronVest captures your credentials and offers to fill them in each time you revisit it. You can view, edit, and delete saved passwords from your dashboard. IronVest also provides audit info for each password entry, highlighting unique passwords with a bright green label and repeated passwords with a yellow label showing how many times it&rsquo;s been used. Each password is also linked to related masked emails or credit cards, which you can access from a small icon next to the entry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>IronVest includes a password generator you can use to create a new password or update an existing one. Password length ranges from 10 to 30 characters, with the default set at 20, using both numbers and special characters. You can disable either of the latter two for sites that don&rsquo;t accept them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"ironvest-masking\">IronVest masking</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Protecting your passwords is only one part of securing your online shopping experience. Every time you submit your phone number, email address, or credit card number to a website, there&rsquo;s a risk it will be sold, leaked, or stolen. IronVest mitigates the problem with masking. The feature works similarly for email addresses and credit cards. In either case, you enter your actual information and IronVest creates and submits a masked version so that the vendor never sees your actual email address or credit card number. Your real email address will still receive any messages from the vendor and your real credit card will be billed. IronVest&rsquo;s mobile edition for Android and iOS extends this masking feature to your phone number. In this case, however, it creates a new phone number that forwards calls, texts, and voicemail messages to your real number.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"IronVest\" class=\"wp-image-1683006\" height=\"657\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IronVest-Tracker.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>IronVest blocks trackers and shows who is trying to follow you.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Ansaldo/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Anti-tracking prevents advertisers, social media sites, and other online entities from shadowing your web surfing. You can see how many trackers IronVest has blocked and who they are from your dashboard, but you get finer control over this feature in the browser extension where you can enable or disable the feature on specific sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"is-ironvest-worth-it\">Is IronVest worth it?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With so much more of our lives moving online in the wake of Covid-19, cybercriminals and scammers have gotten more brazen in their attempts to get ahold of our data. It makes sense, then, to take better care with all your personal information. IronVest offers an intuitive and straightforward way to protect your identity, passwords, credit cards, email addresses, and other sensitive information while ensuring you can still shop and communicate online easily. It&rsquo;s early days for IronVest, and some features were still only available to beta testers at the time of this review, but based on my experience with it, the service is well worth using to secure your online activities. It&rsquo;s free to test it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Editor&rsquo;s note:</strong>&nbsp;Because online services are often iterative, gaining new features and performance improvements over time, our reviews are subject to change in order to accurately reflect the current state of the services.</em></p>\n\nSecurity</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1682997/ironvest-password-manager-review.html", "date_published": "2023-04-12 16:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "AMD pokes Nvidia for not giving gamers enough GPU memory", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Does <em>The Last of Us </em>send your gaming PC into <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1675637/the-last-of-us-pc-port-is-a-disaster-at-launch.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a zombie-like shuffle</a>?

And wouldn&rsquo;t you know it, AMD&rsquo;s Radeon graphics cards tend to beat Nvidia&rsquo;s GeForce cards at the same price, at least when you narrow the scope of comparison to onboard VRAM alone. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A handful of comparisons show the advantages in Radeon cards at approximately the same price level: The $580 Radeon RX 6800 XT has 16GB of RAM versus the $640 GeForce RTX 3070 Ti&rsquo;s 8GB, the $1000 Radeon RX 7900 XTX has 24GB of RAM versus the $1200 GeForce RTX 4080&rsquo;s 16GB, and so on.

While the post doesn&rsquo;t offer any direct comparisons, Nvidia&rsquo;s new $600, 12GB card is positioned to compete performance-wise with either the RX 6800 or the RX 6800 XT, both of which offer the same 12GB of video memory. However, those cards are 2.5 years old &mdash; AMD doesn&rsquo;t have a 7000-series card going for anywhere near that price level, at least officially. We&rsquo;ll have to wait for AMD to round out its newest offerings for a more direct comparison. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And speaking of direct comparisons, it&rsquo;s telling that AMD is making an appeal to gamers&rsquo; sense of value&hellip;but hasn&rsquo;t mentioned the dark horse in this race. Intel&rsquo;s Arc series of discrete GPUs is still fresh, in its very first generation, and leaving a lot to be desired in terms of software extras.

The mechanical keyboard I use every day for work and gaming is on sale. Best Buy&rsquo;s currently selling the <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fcorsair-k70-rgb-mk-2-low-profile-rapidfire-full-size-wired-mechanical-cherry-mx-low-profile-speed-switch-gaming-keyboard-black%2F6298657.p%3FskuId%3D6298657&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Corsair K70 mechanical keyboard for $99.99</a>, which is a savings of $50. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the tactile feedback to the loud click-clack sounds the keys make, mechanical keyboards are a lot of of fun to use and a top choice among gamers due to their responsiveness. The Corsair K70 features <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.cherrymx.de/en/cherry-mx/mx-low-profile/mx-low-profile-red.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1783714-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cherry MX Speed Silver switches</a>, which are quiet and have a total travel distance of 3.4 mm. Plus, Cherry MX switches are considered the gold standard as far as mechanical keyboards go, so you&rsquo;re in for a really good deal here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Corsair K70 is a full-sized keyboard with a total of 104 keys. It has dedicated multimedia controls, a detachable wrist rest, a USB pass-through port, and more. It&rsquo;s not a wireless keyboard, which may deter some folks, but I&rsquo;ve been using it for about a year and I don&rsquo;t mind the cable at all. It&rsquo;s not much of a problem, especially if you&rsquo;ve got superb cable management skills. By the way, the cable length is 5.91 feet and it plugs in via USB Type-C.

It&rsquo;s less well-suited for 4K gaming due to its memory design, but the power efficiency and diminutive size of the Founders Edition impresses.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Finally, Nvidia&rsquo;s 70-class GeForce graphics cards get more than 8GB of memory. And finally, there&rsquo;s a member of the RTX 40-series possibly worth buying other than the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html\">$1,600 flagship</a>. Meet the 12GB GeForce RTX 4070. It&rsquo;s hitting the streets for $599 on April 13.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The GeForce RTX 4070 delivers exceptionally fast 1440p gaming performance while sipping power, a combination that let Nvidia create an adorably tiny Founders Edition version of the GPU. Those frame rates climb even higher in games that support Nvidia&rsquo;s DLSS upscaling technology, and astronomically higher in games embracing DLSS 3 Frame Generation&mdash;even with ray tracing flipped on. Exceptional software features like Nvidia Broadcast, Reflex, and RTX Video Super Resolution help sweeten the pot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The RTX 4070 may be worth considering but it&rsquo;s not a slam-dunk recommendation. Paying $599 for a 70-class graphics card explicitly marketed for 1440p gaming deeply aches, especially when Nvidia made technical decisions that actively hurt the GPU&rsquo;s 4K gaming prowess. We&rsquo;d also like to see 16GB of memory in a $600 graphics card in 2023. Still, while the RTX 4070 costs $100 more than its predecessor, it&rsquo;s nowhere near as insultingly overpriced as the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444726/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-review.html\">$800 RTX 4070 Ti</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1379747/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-tested-5-things.html\">$1,200 RTX 4080</a> are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With those broad-strokes impressions out of the way, let&rsquo;s dig into the details.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>Further reading: </strong><a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/416006/the-best-graphics-cards-for-pc-gaming.html\">The best graphics cards for PC gaming</a></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"toc\" id=\"what-are-the-geforce-rtx-4070s-specs\">What are the GeForce RTX 4070&rsquo;s specs?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nvidia&rsquo;s $599 GeForce RTX 4070 uses a cut-down version of the 4N &ldquo;Ada Lovelace&rdquo; AD104 GPU found in the RTX 4070 Ti. Here&rsquo;s a look at its core specifications:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Graphics Processing Clusters</strong>: 4</li><li><strong>Texture Processing Clusters</strong>: 23</li><li><strong>Streaming Multiprocessors</strong>: 46</li><li><strong>CUDA Cores</strong>: 5888</li><li><strong>Tensor Cores</strong>: 184 (4th Generation)</li><li><strong>RT Cores</strong>: 46 (3rd Generation)</li><li><strong>Texture Units</strong>: 184</li><li><strong>ROP Units</strong>: 64</li><li><strong>Base Clock</strong>: 1920MHz</li><li><strong>Boost Clock</strong>: 2475MHz</li><li><strong>Memory Clock</strong>: 10500MHz</li><li><strong>Memory Data Rate</strong>: 21Gb/s</li><li><strong>Total Video Memory</strong>: 12GB GDDR6X</li><li><strong>Memory Interface</strong>: 192-bit</li><li><strong>Total Memory Bandwidth</strong>: 504GB/s</li><li><strong>Transistor Count</strong>: 35.8 billion</li><li><strong>Connectors</strong>: 3x DisplayPort, 1x HDMI</li><li><strong>Power Connectors</strong>: 2x PCIe 8-pin cables (adapter in box) OR 300W or greater PCIe Gen 5 cable</li><li><strong>Power Supply Required</strong>:650W</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This all represents solid advances over the technology inside last generation&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/393649/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-founders-edition-review-vs-2080-ti.html\">$499 RTX 3070</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/394671/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-ti-review.html\">$599 RTX 3070 Ti</a>, though it&rsquo;s a significant step back from the 4070 Ti&rsquo;s might&mdash;that card runs roughly 15 to 25 percent faster, depending on the game and resolution. The performance gap widens slightly at 4K resolution.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"RTX 4070 backside\" class=\"wp-image-1781170\" height=\"766\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DSC02121.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>You don&rsquo;t really want the GeForce RTX 4070 for 4K gaming anyway&mdash;a conclusion that&rsquo;s supported by Nvidia&rsquo;s decision to market this GPU around playing games at 100 frames per second at 1440p resolution. As we discussed extensively in the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444726/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-review.html\">RTX 4070 Ti&rsquo;s review</a>, Nvidia equipped the AD104 GPU used by both 4070 cards with a surprisingly narrow 192-bit memory bus, which constrains overall memory bandwidth. The RTX 4070 comes with GDDR6X, faster memory than its predecessor, as well as a much larger L2 cache (36.8K) for keeping more tasks on the GPU itself. Both of those help boost memory performance but I wouldn&rsquo;t buy this card for 4K gaming&mdash;only 1440p.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>By contrast, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/393472/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-founders-edition-review.html\">RTX 3080</a>&mdash;which, again, was a higher-tier card that cost $100 less than the 4070 Ti&mdash;wielded a 320-bit bus, which is typical for a high-end GPU. Even the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/394671/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-ti-review.html\">already-pandemic-overpriced $600 RTX 3070 Ti</a>&nbsp;had a 256-bit bus.

That said, with <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1780649/the-full-nerd-ep-251-is-8gb-of-vram-enough-and-bad-pc-gaming-ports.html\">games gobbling ever-increasing amounts of VRAM</a> now that the latest console generation (and 16GB of shared memory) are the standard, I&rsquo;d be nervous about buying a graphics card for 4K gaming with less than 16GB of memory. The RTX 4070&rsquo;s 12GB should be fine for most games at 1440p, though note that flipping on ray-tracing effects eats heavily into VRAM as well.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"RTX 4070 FE vs RTX 4080 FE\" class=\"wp-image-1781168\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DSC02122.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"RTX 4070 FE vs RTX 4080 FE\" class=\"wp-image-1781166\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DSC02123.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>The GeForce RTX 4070 Founders Edition is substantially smaller than the gargantuan RTX 4080 FE.</p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a tremendously energy-efficient graphics card, which let Nvidia craft a smaller, totally adorable dual-slot version of its Founders Edition board. Nvidia&rsquo;s fantastic-looking FE designs treat almost every part of the card as a heatsink and utilize unorthodox flow-through fan cooling. That all holds true with the RTX 4070 FE&mdash;it&rsquo;s just <em>so much smaller</em> than its triple-slot siblings. This beast will be popular in high-end small form-factor gaming builds.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>The GeForce RTX 4070 delivers exceptional 1440p gaming performance in even the most strenuous games, with best-in-class ray tracing performance if you want to turn those cutting-edge lighting features on.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Nvidia equipped the RTX 4070 Founders Edition with a single HDMI 2.1 port as well as three DisplayPort 1.4a connections. It also uses the new 16-pin 12VHPWR connector despite its relatively modest power demands&mdash;you only need a 650W supply&mdash;so be prepared to look at the unsightly too-short adapter plugs in your case if you don&rsquo;t want to invest in a <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1369361/what-you-need-to-know-before-buying-a-new-pc-power-supply.html\">new ATX 3.0 power supply</a> (or at least custom 12VHPWR cords).

Nvidia&rsquo;s software stack is a <em>major</em> feather in its cap. It&rsquo;s worth noting that while the RTX 4070 supports AV1 encoding, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1375901/tested-nvidias-geforce-rtx-4090-is-a-content-creation-monster.html\">new to GeForce this generation</a>, product manager Justin Walker told me the 4070 only includes a single AV1 encoder rather than the pair found in higher-priced RTX 40-series offerings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Got it? Good. Let&rsquo;s get to the benchmarks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"toc\" id=\"our-test-system\">Our test system</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We test graphics cards on an AMD Ryzen 5900X PC used exclusively for benchmarking GPUs. We now test with PCIe Resizable BAR (also known as Smart Access Memory on Ryzen systems) active, as most modern gaming PCs released in the last four years support the performance-boosting feature, either natively or via a motherboard firmware update. Nvidia also recommends turning on the optional &ldquo;Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling&rdquo; option in Windows to let the RTX 40-series stretch its legs to the fullest, so we&rsquo;ve made that tweak as well. Most of the hardware was provided by the manufacturers, but we purchased the storage ourselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>AMD Ryzen 5900X, stock settings</li><li>AMD Wraith Max cooler</li><li>MSI Godlike X570 motherboard</li><li>32GB G.Skill Trident Z Neo DDR4 3800 memory, XMP active</li><li>Corsair <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-HX1500i-Platinum-Ultra-Low-Connectors/dp/B0B3S8GMCK&amp;xcust=2-1-1781139-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">HX1500i power supply</a> (and optional <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.corsair.com/us/en/Categories/Products/Accessories-%7C-Parts/PC-Components/Power-Supplies/600W-PCIe-5-0-12VHPWR-Type-4-PSU-Power-Cable/p/CP-8920284&amp;xcust=2-1-1781139-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">$20 12VHPWR 600 cable</a> for Nvidia GPUs)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/3440740/sk-hynix-gold-s31-review-a-great-sata-ssd-from-the-largest-vendor-youve-likely-never-heard-of.html\">1TB SK Hynix Gold S31 SSD</a> x2</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We test a variety of games spanning various engines, genres, vendor sponsorships (Nvidia, AMD, and Intel), and graphics APIs (DirectX 9, 11, DX12, and Vulkan), to try to represent a full range of performance potential.

We&rsquo;ve also enabled temporal anti-aliasing (TAA) to push these cards to their limits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We run each benchmark at least three times and list the average result for each test. Outside of esports, we&rsquo;ve limited our benchmarks to 4K and 1440p resolutions, as those are the natural fits for these juggernaut GPUs (despite the 4070 Ti&rsquo;s paltry bus width). We test features like ray tracing and DLSS in a separate section, as upscaling features like DLSS and AMD&rsquo;s rival FSR tweak the look of games to help them run faster. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&rsquo;re going to show these benchmarks without individual game commentary. In addition to paying attention to how the RTX 4070 performs in relation to the 4070 Ti, 3080, and 3070, also note how it compares against AMD&rsquo;s Radeon RX 6800 XT and 6900 XT&mdash;two last-generation models that are faster and more memory-packed than Nvidia&rsquo;s new offering, and can often be found for less on the street. Nvidia&rsquo;s GPUs womp in ray tracing and extra features, though they lag behind Radeon in raw esports frame rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"toc\" id=\"how-fast-is-the-geforce-rtx-4070\">How fast is the GeForce RTX 4070?</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"RTX 4070 benchmarks\" class=\"wp-image-1781160\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cyberpunk.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1142\" width=\"1142\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"RTX 4070 red dead redemption 2 benchmarks\" class=\"wp-image-1781149\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/rt-rdr2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1142\" width=\"1142\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"RTX 4070 benchmarks\" class=\"wp-image-1781165\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/csgo.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1142\" width=\"1142\" /><figcaption><p>The RTX 4070 and 4070 Ti deliver especially underwhelming 4K performance in CSGO.</p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"RTX 4070 benchmarks\" class=\"wp-image-1781157\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cod-mw2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1142\" width=\"1142\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"RTX 4070 benchmarks\" class=\"wp-image-1781155\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/gears-tactics.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1142\" width=\"1142\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"RTX 4070 benchmarks\" class=\"wp-image-1781151\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/f1-22.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1142\" width=\"1142\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"RTX 4070 benchmarks\" class=\"wp-image-1781158\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/hzd.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1142\" width=\"1142\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"RTX 4070 benchmarks\" class=\"wp-image-1781161\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/hitman-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1142\" width=\"1142\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"RTX 4070 total way troy benchmarks\" class=\"wp-image-1781152\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/total-war-troy.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1142\" width=\"1142\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"RTX 4070 watchdogs legion benchmarks\" class=\"wp-image-1781147\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/watch-dogs.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1142\" width=\"1142\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"toc\" id=\"how-is-the-rtx-4070s-ray-tracing-and-dlss-performance\">How is the RTX 4070&rsquo;s ray tracing and DLSS performance?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to traditional gaming tests, we separately benchmark how graphics cards perform with ray tracing enabled at the highest possible settings (though we stick to Ultra, not Psycho, in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since ray tracing tanks frame rates, we also test how Nvidia and AMD&rsquo;s DLSS and FSR upscaling technologies, respectively, manage to claw back performance using their Balanced quality presets, which straddle the line between optimizing for better image quality and faster frame rates. We&rsquo;ve also chosen benchmarks that show how <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html#toc-5\">Nvidia&rsquo;s new DLSS 3 Frame Generation</a> can supercharge frame rates and visual smoothness even further by inserting AI-generated frames between every GPU-rendered frame. Nvidia says DLSS 3 is being adopted 7x faster than DLSS 2 was and it can deliver truly transformative visual smoothness in games that support it, but it&rsquo;s only available for new RTX 40-series offerings.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that DLSS and FSR both work by rendering a frame at a lower resolution, then scaling it to fit your screen using software smarts. They also have several different quality presets available. Comparing DLSS vs. FSR in raw frame rate isn&rsquo;t as apples-to-apples as comparing native gaming performance, in other words, but still worth examining as they&rsquo;re features most gamers will use in the real world. That warning goes doubly so for DLSS 3&rsquo;s radical AI frame generation, which can <em>sometimes</em> generate artifacts and other slight inconsistencies, as Hardware Unboxed&rsquo;s excellent video above shows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The charts below show native 1440p performance; native 1440p with ray tracing ultra active; upscaled DLSS/FSR Balanced mode performance with ray tracing ultra active; and, for RTX 40-series GPUs only, DLSS 3 Frame Gen performance with ray tracing ultra active. You can also activate DLSS/FSR or DLSS 3 without ray tracing active for even faster frame rates but we only tested that scenario in <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> because there are only so many hours in the day, y&rsquo;all.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"RTX 4070 benchmarks\" class=\"wp-image-1781162\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/rt-cyberpunk.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1142\" width=\"1142\" /><figcaption><p>Cyberpunk 2077&rsquo;s showcases the best that Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX technology suite has to offer.</p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"RTX 4070 Hitman 3 RT benchmarks\" class=\"wp-image-1781159\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/rt-hitman-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1142\" width=\"1142\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"RTX 4070 benchmarks\" class=\"wp-image-1781154\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/rt-f1-22.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1142\" width=\"1142\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"RTX 4070 watchdogs legion RT benchmarks\" class=\"wp-image-1781156\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/RT-watch-dogs.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1142\" width=\"1142\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"RTX 4070 red dead redemption 2 benchmarks\" class=\"wp-image-1781149\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/rt-rdr2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1142\" width=\"1142\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"toc\" id=\"is-the-geforce-rtx-4070-power-efficient\">Is the GeForce RTX 4070 power efficient?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We test power draw by looping the&nbsp;<em>F1 22</em>&nbsp;benchmark at 4K for about 20 minutes after we&rsquo;ve benchmarked everything else (to warm up the GPU) and noting the highest reading on our Watts Up Pro meter, which measures the power consumption of our entire test system.

Nvidia&rsquo;s killer software stack enhances every aspect of the GPU, from creation to streaming to gaming, with features like <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/393646/tested-how-nvidia-reflex-can-make-you-a-better-esports-gamer.html\">Nvidia Reflex</a>, Broadcast, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1525299/nvidia-rtx-video-super-resolution-tested.html\">RTX Video Super Resolution</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html#toc-5\">DLSS 3 Frame Generation</a> truly improving your day-to-day experience.

It&rsquo;ll fit into most any system. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s not a slam dunk though. Nvidia&rsquo;s decision to equip the RTX 4070 with a 192-bit bus and 12GB of memory prevent us from being able to recommend it for long-term 4K gaming, especially with memory requirements only rising in modern games. (We applaud the bump in memory from 8GB to 12GB, but $600 graphics cards really should have 16GB or more in 2023.)</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget is-half-width is-float-right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"a-rival-with-more-vram-and-4k-gaming-capabilities\">\n\t\t\t\t\tA rival with more vram and 4k gaming capabilities\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"radeon-rx-6800-xt\">Radeon RX 6800 XT</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Radeon RX 6800 XT\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"4000\" src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/11/dsc01295-100866113-orig.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"6000\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__pricing-details  \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08TJ2BHCQ?tag=pcworld02-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;xcust=2-1-1781139-5-392735-9919&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$579.99 at  Amazon</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"amp-bar\"> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/321564/633495/10014?prodsku=6453268&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.bestbuy.com%2Fclick%2F-%2F6453268%2Fpdp&amp;intsrc=CATF_4831&amp;subid1=2-1-1781139-5-392735-9919\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$579.99 at  Best Buy</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>If you want a 4K graphics card around this price range, complete with more memory, consider AMD&rsquo;s last-generation <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/393807/amd-radeon-rx-6900-xt-review.html\">Radeon RX 6800 XT</a> or <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/393807/amd-radeon-rx-6900-xt-review.html\">6900 XT</a> instead (or the 6850 XT and 6950 XT variants). Both come with 16GB of VRAM, wide memory buses, and run as fast or faster than the RTX 4070, especially at 4K resolution. Radeon GPUs also excel at esports frame rates.

You give up AV1 encoding, DLSS, and Nvidia&rsquo;s excellent ray tracing chops and extra features, however. Avoid the $800 4070 Ti for 4K gaming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&rsquo;re giving up something with either side these days. It remains a fairly bleak time for $500-plus graphics cards.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"RTX 4070 FE vs RTX 4080 FE\" class=\"wp-image-1781168\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DSC02122.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>The RTX 4070 is smol.</p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said right up top, the $599 GeForce RTX 4070 is the only current Nvidia 40-series graphics card potentially worth your money aside from the flagship RTX 4090. That&rsquo;s because Nvidia didn&rsquo;t jack its price as painfully as the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444726/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-review.html\">$800 RTX 4070 Ti</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1379747/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-tested-5-things.html\">$1,200 RTX 4080</a>, <em>not</em> because it&rsquo;s a good value. The $599 RTX 4070 is $100 more than its predecessor, and $100 less than the RTX 3080. In most games, the RTX 3080 trades blow or is a handful of frames faster than the RTX 4070. Sure, the RTX 4070&rsquo;s power efficiency and DLSS 3 Frame Gen features are deeply impressive indeed, but in raw gaming performance, Nvidia&rsquo;s 40-series continues to offer stagnant gen-on-gen value, 2.5 years after the 30-series launched. Not every game will support features like DLSS or FSR.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buy the GeForce RTX 4070 if you want a reasonably sized, highly efficient 1440p gaming beast, complete with access to all the latest and greatest Nvidia software features&mdash;and if you&rsquo;re willing to spend $600 on a graphics card like that. Avoid it for long-term 4K usage, and <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/416006/the-best-graphics-cards-for-pc-gaming.html\">comparison shop before you buy</a> as last-gen graphics cards may offer better value. &nbsp;</p>\n\nGaming, Graphics Cards</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1781139/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-review.html", "date_published": "2023-04-12 13:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Nvidia\u2019s RTX Video Super Resolution gets VLC support to beautify offline videos", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Nvidia&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1525299/nvidia-rtx-video-super-resolution-tested.html\">awesome new RTX Video Super Resolution feature</a> is about to get even better. When the technology launched earlier this year, promising AI-enhanced video upscaling to get rid of blurry web videos, it only supported videos played in Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. Today, alongside the launch of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1781139/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-review.html\">$599 GeForce RTX 4070</a>, Nvidia revealed that <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1781216-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">VideoLAN&rsquo;s legendary VLC media player</a> is also gaining RTX Video Super Resolution support today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Yesssssss</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bringing VLC into the fold means RTX Video Super Resolution can now work its magic on your offline video collection too&mdash;obviously a humongous boon for cinephiles. Nvidia&rsquo;s feature puts the AI tensor cores found inside GeForce RTX 30- and 40-series graphics cards to work by beautifying ugly video. It can upscale low-resolution videos to higher resolutions and run your video through an algorithm that softens the darks that tend to get crushed and blown out and blocky while also sharpening high-contrast areas (like user interface elements).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In my experience using RTX Video Super Resolution for the web, video looked substantially better when you&rsquo;re viewing streams with polished production values and high bitrates, such as on Netflix or Disney+. It&rsquo;s especially good for anime and cartoons. Fast-paced action with lower bitrates (such as <em>Call of Duty</em> Twitch streams) don&rsquo;t tend to see as much benefit. I&rsquo;d wager that the local video stored on many people&rsquo;s PCs will look amazing viewed through RTX Video&rsquo;s AI-enhanced lens, though I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to play around with it yet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, you&rsquo;ll need to make sure both your GeForce drivers and VLC are running the latest builds to unlock the feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>RTX Video Super Resolution does increase the power output of your graphics card and can affect performance if you&rsquo;re playing games and watching upscaled videos at the same time. You&rsquo;ll also need to manually activate it and choose a quality level in Nvidia&rsquo;s clunky Control Panel. All that said, the feature is still <em>very</em> much worth using and perhaps even considering when you&rsquo;re <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/416006/the-best-graphics-cards-for-pc-gaming.html\">shopping for a new graphics card</a>&mdash;it&rsquo;s basically DLSS for crappy videos.

I&rsquo;m talking about fast, simple changes that improve the feel of the operating system, turn off annoying ads, reduce the data you send to Microsoft, and more. Better yet, you can do them all in under five minutes&mdash;something I did mere weeks ago when I needed to <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/436674/the-best-pc-laptops-of-the-year.html\">pick up a Windows 11 laptop</a> for some travel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are five Windows 11 settings worth changing immediately, with an added bonus at the end.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"1-move-the-start-button-to-the-left-corner\">1. Move the Start button to the left corner</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What can I say, I&rsquo;m a traditionalist. I understand Microsoft&rsquo;s desire to revamp Windows 10&rsquo;s interface to more closely mirror the style of Macs and Chromebooks&mdash;legions of kids get schooled on those, after all&mdash;but Windows 11&rsquo;s shifting taskbar icons drive me batty. I want mousing over to the Start menu to be muscle memory, not yet another task I have to look at and mentally process.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"windows 11 settings \" class=\"wp-image-1782370\" height=\"466\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/taskbar-alignment.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, Microsoft makes it easy to move the Start menu back to the left-hand corner. Simply open the Start menu and head to <em>Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Taskbar &gt; Taskbar behaviors.</em> You&rsquo;ll see a field labeled&nbsp;<strong>Taskbar alignment&nbsp;</strong>with a drop-down menu. Change the drop-dox menu from Center to Left.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Boom! Onto the next.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"2-turn-off-annoying-notifications\">2. Turn off annoying notifications</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, it&rsquo;s time to turn off those annoying pop-up notifications. Windows 11 itself spawns some, but the worst offenders are third-party apps, especially if your laptop or desktop came preloaded with bloatware. Making the distractions stop is simple.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"windows 11 settings \" class=\"wp-image-1782369\" height=\"749\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/notifications-list.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Head to <em>Start &gt; System &gt; Notifications</em>. You can turn notifications off universally if you desire. I prefer to work through the list manually, leaving notifications on for critical tools like Slack, Discord, and my <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407277/best-antivirus-for-windows-pc.html\">antivirus software</a>. (If my AV scanner wants to shout about something, I want to hear it!) Either way, this menu cures many headaches.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"3-turn-off-microsoft-ads\">3. Turn off Microsoft ads</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>That segues neatly into the next tip. Keep scrolling down beyond the bottom of the list of apps that can send you notifications. There, you&rsquo;ll see a couple of additional boxes that relate to Windows 11 itself providing &ldquo;tips and suggestions&rdquo; on how to use your PC. If you know your way around well enough, deselect the <strong>Offer suggestions on how I can set up my device</strong> and <strong>Get tips and suggestions when I use Windows </strong>boxes. I prefer to leave the <strong>Show me the Windows welcome experience&hellip;</strong> option checked so I&rsquo;m notified of new features when a big update drops.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"windows 11 settings \" class=\"wp-image-1782367\" height=\"475\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ads-settings-app.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>We&rsquo;re not done yet, though. If you don&rsquo;t like seeing Microsoft promotions pop up in your Settings app, head to <em>Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; security &gt; General</em>. Disabling &ldquo;Show me suggested content in the Settings app&rdquo; does the trick, though you may want to turn off all these options.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"windows 11 settings \" class=\"wp-image-1782371\" height=\"812\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ads-windows-usage.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, head to <em>Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Device Usage</em>. The options here tell Microsoft how you use your computer so Windows 11 can provide tailored recommendations for apps, websites, Office 365 trials, and more. Turn them all off if you&rsquo;re not interested in your $100+ copy of Windows 11 upselling you on more Microsoft services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are other places Microsoft promotions lurk such as the beautiful lock screens provided by Bing Images, but tweaking this handful of settings eradicates the most irritating ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"4-change-your-default-browser\">4. Change your default browser</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft Edge is pretty darned good, actually, but if you&rsquo;re a diehard Chrome, Firefox, Opera, or Brave user, switching your default browser is easy. (<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/630863/firefox-and-vivaldi-call-foul-on-microsofts-default-browser-fix.html\">Well, these days</a>).</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"windows 11 settings default app\" class=\"wp-image-1782365\" height=\"581\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/windows-11-browser-default.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>After downloading and installing the browser of your choice, it should ask if you want to make it the default. Do so, duh. But if you missed your chance during setup, navigate to <em>Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Default apps</em>, find the name of your browser in the list, and click on it. A &ldquo;Make &lt;browser name&gt; your default browser&rdquo; banner with a <strong>Set default</strong> button at the top of the page does the trick.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"5-declutter-the-taskbar\">5. Declutter the taskbar</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep, Windows 11&rsquo;s nerfed taskbar sucks and Microsoft stuffs it to the brim with icons and features you probably have no interest in. Make it easier on the eyes and reclaim some space by heading to <em>Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Taskbar</em> and deselecting any of the taskbar items you&rsquo;ll never use. Adios, Widgets and Teams Chat.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"windows 11 settings \" class=\"wp-image-1782366\" height=\"506\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/win11-taskbar-icons-default.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>While we&rsquo;re on the topic, spending $5 on <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/549492/hands-on-stardocks-start11-largely-solves-the-sins-of-windows-11.html\">Stardock&rsquo;s Start11</a> or <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/552936/startallback-fixes-what-i-hate-about-the-windows-11-ui.html\">StartIsBack</a> is well worth it. The programs offer granular options that expand the look and functionality of the taskbar and Start menu alike, making it a lot easier to <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/541452/make-windows-11-look-like-windows-10.html\">make Windows 11 look like Windows 10</a>. They&rsquo;re beyond the scope of this article but deserve a shout-out.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"bonus-dark-mode-baby\">Bonus: Dark mode, baby!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, an optional personal preference. Some folks like staring at black text on white screens all day. Others, like me, prefer not to sear their retinas. So, the very first thing I always do with a new Windows install is activate dark mode, a preference that carries over into several apps once you&rsquo;ve set it.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"windows 11 settings \" class=\"wp-image-1782368\" height=\"635\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/dark-mode.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply head to <em>Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Colors </em>and look for a field called <strong>Choose your mode</strong>. Change the drop-down menu from Light to Dark. Your eyes will thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s about it for this rundown of quick Windows 11 settings to change immediately.
