  <p id="CcFs9c">Warner Bros. Discovery’s revamped subscription service is just called “Max,” and the company explained why it dropped the HBO branding at a press event on Wednesday. A key reason was to help Warner Bros. Discovery broaden the appeal of the app so that it’s not mostly targeted at content for adults.</p>
<p id="HLhrBY">“We want [Max] to be welcoming to all and easily recognizable, including to a key customer segment, kids and families,” JB Perrette, president and CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery’s global streaming and games, said at the event. “We all love HBO. And it’s a brand that has been built over five decades to be the edgy, groundbreaking trendsetter in entertainment for adults. But it’s not exactly where parents would most eagerly drop off their kids.”</p>

  <p id="jzTNTA"><a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/04/12/xbox-april-2023-update-available-today/">Microsoft is getting ready</a> to roll out its new energy-saving features for the Xbox Series X / S consoles this week. This includes an active hours feature that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/11/23549812/microsoft-xbox-series-x-s-energy-saver-mode-switch">Microsoft initially started testing in January</a> that will let Xbox owners boot their console quickly during certain hours and shut it down fully to save on energy during times when it’s used less.</p>
<p id="ONcGIm">Active hours means an Xbox will only draw 0.5 watts when it’s fully shut down, instead of 10–15 watts during the Standby mode. You can either set active hours times yourself or let your Xbox adjust them automatically depending on when you use the console the most. In other words, if your active hours are set between 12PM and 10PM, that means your console will be ready to boot in seconds...</p>

The film made its debut <a href="https://tiff.net/events/sanctuary-wigon">at TIFF</a> last year, and it stars Margaret Qualley (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20941606/death-stranding-review-ps4-hideo-kojima"><em>Death Stranding</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/1/15469148/the-leftovers-hbo-lost-finale-review"><em>The Leftovers</em></a>) and Christopher Abbott (<em>Girls</em>, <em>Possessor</em>) and is the second feature from director Zachary Wigon. The new trailer is a back-and-forth game of power dynamics filled with safe words, hidden cameras, and some light betrayal.</p>
<p id="k8TBfZ">Here’s the official premise:</p>
<blockquote><p id="P2Osp4">In the wake of inheriting his father’s hotel chain, Hal (Abbott) attempts to end his long and secret relationship with Rebecca (Qualley).

  <p id="zhsPde"><em>Redfall</em>, which is set to be one of Microsoft and Bethesda’s biggest Xbox releases of the year, won’t have a 60fps performance mode on consoles at launch, <a href="https://twitter.com/playRedfall/status/1646158836103880708">developer Arkane Austin announced on Wednesday</a>. Instead, the game will be limited to a quality mode that enables 30fps at 4K resolution on Xbox Series X and 30fps at 1440p on Xbox Series S.</p>
<p id="CHbNoi">The announcement is disappointing, especially so close to the game’s nearly here <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/25/23500219/redfall-release-date-xbox-bethesda">May 2nd launch date</a> and when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR8GVePOdpY">previous footage has been in 60fps</a>. <em>Redfall</em> looks like it will be a decently fast-paced shooter, and I’m worried that the 30fps limitation on Xbox will make the game feel sluggish. (And personally, I always pick a higher frame rate over higher-quality graphics anyway.)</p>

  <p id="1Dt7gQ">Microsoft is bringing Windows 11 to its HoloLens 2 headset. The update will be available free of charge, and Microsoft says it should appear by the end of June as an optional upgrade. HoloLens 2 owners can continue to use Windows 10, but Windows 11 will offer better app performance and some key developer-focused additions.</p>

It’s also a completely impossible, completely subjective question that depends on everything from your budget to your favorite <em>Mission: Impossible </em>movie. The streaming market is a teeming mass of stuff, with various platforms rising and falling, and nothing ever stays the same for very long.</p>

So, for this episode of <em>The Vergecast</em>, we decided to answer that big question the only way we know how: chaotically and at great length. So we held the first annual Vergecast Streaming Services draft in which our three co-hosts each drafted their top five streaming services. There were surprises from the very beginning,...</p>

  <p id="WG05lF">After months of leaks saying Apple will ditch the physical volume and power buttons on this year’s iPhone 15 Pro in favor of fancy solid-state replacements, one of the original sources of the rumor now says it’s not happening. </p>
<p id="TksTJA">“My latest survey indicates that due to unresolved technical issues before mass production, both high-end iPhone 15 Pro models (Pro &amp; Pro Max) will abandon the closely-watched solid-state button design and revert to the traditional physical button design,” reputable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo wrote in a <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/two-iphone-15-pro-models-removal-of-solid-state-button-design-negatively-affects-cirrus-logic-and-a456d5e7386c">Medium post</a>. <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/04/11/iphone-15-pro-may-not-have-new-volume-buttons/"><em>9to5Mac</em> reports</a> that another analyst, Haitong Tech’s Jeff Pu, also thinks Apple will stick with traditional mechanical buttons for iPhone 15 Pro models.</p>

  <p id="5jDvNx">Strava has been around since 2009, but today, the popular fitness app is finally, <em>finally</em> adding an in-app Spotify integration.

When asked about the possibility of adding other platforms, Ortega didn’t rule out the possibility but noted that Spotify was a clear first step.</p>
