Drawing on 20 years of on-the-ground reporting and revealing new interviews with both U.S. and Taliban officials, award-winning producers Marcela Gaviria and Martin Smith chronicle how what began in the wake of the 9/11 attacks as an effort to eliminate Al Qaeda and oust its ruling ally, the Taliban, became America’s longest war with nearly 50,000 Afghan civilians dead, approximately 2,400 American servicemembers killed — and how it ended in defeat in August 2021 with U.S. troops withdrawing, the Western-backed Afghan government collapsing, and the Taliban once again in control.

Part Two of “America and the Taliban” focuses on how the war effort, which started under President George W. Bush, played out during President Barack Obama’s tenure. The documentary examines how a pattern of Afghan civilian casualties incurred during raids and other errant attacks severely undercut the U.S. military’s effort to win “hearts and minds” in the country, how U.S. efforts to train Afghan forces ran up against corruption and low morale and how the Taliban regained ground in Afghanistan.

Watch Parts One and Two now. Part Three premieres April 25.
