Not Jarred Gillett, an Australian once held up as the standard-bearer for how the job should be done after a flamin\u2019 clip of him in action during an A-League game went viral, but who has been embroiled in more than his fair share of controversies since hitching his Ute to the PGMOL wagon. Not the Spanish match officials who have brandished an astonishing 95 red cards in La Liga already this season, compared to the 24 shown by their counterparts in the Premier League. And not the Brazilian fellow who incensed so many English players, pundits, hacks and fans with his performance in the HR World Cup quarter-final against France. No, foreign whistleblowers are contention-proof and we need more of them coming over here, taking our referees\u2019 jobs.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/12/football-daily-polish-match-officials-greece\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/12/football-daily-polish-match-officials-greece", "date_published": "2023-04-12 15:06:14+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Up all night to get jet\u00e9!

But every so often \u2013 once in a generation, occasionally more if you are lucky \u2013 there are those that come along who are a cut above. They make their craft look effortless, gliding and dancing across the grass. They are the artists of the sport who paint different pictures on the pitch and exist at least three paces ahead of everyone else around them, directing play like a conductor does an orchestra.</p><p>Germany\u2019s Dzsenifer Marozs\u00e1n belongs to this unique set of players. As she entered the field on Tuesday for the 112th and final time in a Germany shirt, there was a real sense we were saying goodbye to one of her country\u2019s best ever. She bowed to the 32,000 fans, each and every one showing their appreciation for a player who many see as the most technically capable to play for the national team. For a girl who \u201cjust wanted to play football\u201d, hers has been an international career that has spanned 13 years as her and her nation became European champions for the eighth time and Olympic gold medallists for the first.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/12/germany-legend-dzsenifer-marozsan-bows-out-in-typically-graceful-style\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/12/germany-legend-dzsenifer-marozsan-bows-out-in-typically-graceful-style", "date_published": "2023-04-12 11:04:21+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "\u2018Explicitly queer and trans\u2019: the 1580s play that inspired Shakespeare\u2019s cross-dressing love plots", "description": "<p>John Lyly\u2019s long-forgotten Galatea \u2013 featuring gods, mortals and a highly elastic approach to gender and sex \u2013 is being revived at the Brighton festival.

The blaze is described as \u201ca massacre by negligence, a criminal activity, a corporate atrocity, an obliteration of families\u201d.

This second fire is at the Kilburn home of Cornelius Pitt, estranged father of Melissa, one of the characters in Ordinary People. His death brings Melissa\u2019s mother, Alice, back to a nagging ache. Alice wants to build a house in Nigeria, the place she left to come to the UK half a century ago. She wants to return to \u201cthe red-flecked paths of Benin City, with the voices of the air being her own kind of voice, the loneliness and exclusion of foreignness erased\u201d. She wants to go back to her motherland, leaving her children and grandchildren in London, to see out the final part of her life. It\u2019s moving to find the thinking and desires of often overlooked older African women beautifully attended to in this part of the novel.

Though the jacket of The Best Minds, novelist Jonathan Rosen\u2019s extraordinary account of his friend Michael Laudor\u2019s mental illness, speaks only of a \u201chorrific act\u201d committed by its subject, readers are well aware that something dreadful is coming. It is testament to the author\u2019s ability to immerse us in the world he builds that this doesn\u2019t stop us from willing a different outcome, feeling that every success might just stick, and each calamity could in fact be a temporary setback. In doing so we mirror the reactions of those around Laudor at the time, from friends to teachers to the titans of media and Hollywood \u2013 reactions that arguably helped seal his fate and that of his fiancee, Carrie Costello.</p><p>To say that this is a memoir, a case study, or a book about schizophrenia is to dramatically undersell it. Though Rosen\u2019s lens is particular, his view is panoptic. This is a magisterial work, as much a sociological study of late 20th-century America as it is a book about madness. It is also a book about childhood and friendship, the long shadow of the second world war and its unexpected intellectual legacy, about ambition and delusion and the danger of stories. Despite weighing in at more than 500 pages, the narrative scarcely drags thanks to Rosen\u2019s style, which is easygoing, but spiced with moments of pin-sharp brilliance.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/12/the-best-minds-by-jonathan-rosen-review-when-hope-fails\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/12/the-best-minds-by-jonathan-rosen-review-when-hope-fails", "date_published": "2023-04-12 06:30:06+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "After Ivanka Trump's strategic exit, is Tiffany the new 'first daughter'? | Arwa Mahdawi", "description": "<p>Trump\u2019s only child with Marla Maples seems to have gone from avoiding the spotlight to being her father\u2019s biggest fan</p><p>Well, it looks like Melaniawatch is officially over.

The planet\u2019s shortest living dog, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guinness-world-records\">Guinness World Records</a> has announced.</p><p>Pearl qualified for the title after a veterinarian at the Crystal Creek animal hospital in Orlando, Florida, where she was born, used a special dog-measuring wicket to determine she was just under 3.6in (9.14cm) tall and 5in (12.7cm) long. Those dimensions mean she is shorter than the standard television remote and about as long as a dollar bill, Guinness said in <a href=\"https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2023/4/pocket-sized-chihuahua-certified-as-worlds-shortest-dog-743720\">a statement</a>.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/12/guinness-world-record-shortest-dog-pearl-chihuahua\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/12/guinness-world-record-shortest-dog-pearl-chihuahua", "date_published": "2023-04-12 05:00:05+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Russia-Ukraine war live: Russia \u2018risks becoming economic colony of China\u2019 as isolation deepens, says CIA director", "description": "<p>William Burns says Moscow may become dependent on Beijing for export of energy resources and raw materials</p><ul><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance\">Russia-Ukraine war at a glance</a></strong></li></ul><p>Russia risks becoming an \u201ceconomic colony\u201d of China as its isolation from the West deepens after the invasion of Ukraine, CIA Director William Burns said on Tuesday.</p><p>\u201cRussia is becoming more and more dependent on China and, in some respects, runs the risk of becoming an economic colony of China over time, dependent for export of energy resources and raw materials,\u201d Burns said at an event at Rice University in Houston.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/apr/12/russia-ukraine-war-live-russia-risks-becoming-economic-colony-of-china-as-isolation-deepens-says-cia-director\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/apr/12/russia-ukraine-war-live-russia-risks-becoming-economic-colony-of-china-as-isolation-deepens-says-cia-director", "date_published": "2023-04-12 04:55:22+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Every street lamp in Wellington at risk of falling down, residents warned", "description": "<p>Residents in New Zealand\u2019s capital urged to report \u2018drooping\u2019 lights as council starts work on fixing all 17,000 lamps, which weigh more than 11kg each</p><p>It began with a single street lamp.
