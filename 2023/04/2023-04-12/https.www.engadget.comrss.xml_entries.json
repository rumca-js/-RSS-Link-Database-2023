At least three other states are currently considering similar legislation.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The laws are also controversial.

The legislation includes a number of exemptions that would seem to excuse some prominent platforms.</p><p>For example, it states that platforms focused on \u201cprofessional networking\u201d and \u201ccareer development\u201d are exempt, which would seem to be a direct reference to LinkedIn. It also has exceptions for gaming-focused companies, as well as companies that allow  \u201ca user to generate short video clips of dancing, voice overs, or other acts of entertainment in which the primary purpose is not educational or informative,\u201d which could be interpreted as excluding TikTok.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/arkansas-passes-social-media-law-requiring-age-verification-230716388.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/arkansas-passes-social-media-law-requiring-age-verification-230716388.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-12 23:07:16+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Juul will pay $462 million to 6 states in underage vaping settlement", "description": "<p>The New York Attorney General has announced that its youth vaping lawsuit against <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/juul/\">Juul </a>is over, ending with an agreement that distribute a $462 million settlement between six states and Washington DC. \u201cJUUL lit a nationwide public health crisis by putting addictive products in the hands of minors and convincing them that it\u2019s harmless,&quot; Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. &quot;Today they are paying the price for the harm they caused.\u201d The settlement will be split among the states of New York, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-18-juul-california-lawsuit-teen-vaping.html\">California</a>, Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Mexico and the District of Columbia.</p><p>The 2019 lawsuit <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-19-juul-lawsuit-new-york-attorney-general.html\">alleged that Juul engaging in deceptive marketing</a> and illegally sold products to minors by glamorizing vaping with ads that featured &quot;young models using fruity, sweet and minty flavors that appealed to youth.&quot; In addition to the monetary penalty, the settlement includes strict restrictions to keep Juul from marketing its products that way in the future, including a ban on showing persons under 35 years of age using its products and rules that would keep Juul product placement from appearing in movies, tv shows, video games and even virtual reality.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>This is the largest multi-state settlement Juul has made yet, but it's only a small part of the total the company has paid so far.

Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav, who <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/warnermedia-discovery-merger-hbo-max-discovery-plus-214335645.html\">spearheaded the $43 billion merger</a> between WB and his previous company Discovery, announced the new service during a media event this morning. It's been a year since Zaslav finalized that merger and announced his intentions to combine each network's content. And, given the increasingly volatile world of streaming media, he likely had to move quickly. But the rebranding seems like a missed opportunity to align the new service with something people already know and love.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Now, to be clear, Zaslav's desire to build something new makes sense. HBO Max's May 2020 launch was notoriously rocky, so much so that it led to <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjODEzYWUzOS03ZDU4LTQxY2ItYWM2Ni1hZDgzMDYwNmNlZWYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMC8wOC8xNi9idXNpbmVzcy9tZWRpYS9ob2xseXdvb2Qtc3R1ZGlvcy1maXJpbmdzLXN0cmVhbWluZy5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlMjcxMWEzOC1iMzYxLTQ5YmUtYTliMC0yNGYxM2YwZmI5OTEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAd_OcQKf-3xCO8rIv_-HAKHSQzVjnt7jSYX3mtorzgQ4&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2020%2F08%2F16%2Fbusiness%2Fmedia%2Fhollywood-studios-firings-streaming.html\">a round of executive firings</a>. HBO Max was a blatant attempt to catch up with Disney+, which <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/disney-says-disney-plus-has-over-10-million-signups-1203403515/\">hit 10 million subscribers </a>just a day after its debut. But it couldn't compete with Disney's seemingly limitless library of content. A month after HBO Max arrived, AT&amp;T (TimeWarner's owner at the time) said the service only had <a href=\"https://variety.com/vip/hbo-max-subscriber-math-demystified-1234715002/\">4.1 million active users</a>. The company tried to make it seem more popular by saying it had 23.6 million \"wholesale\" subscribers, but those were mostly existing HBO customers who had never touched the HBO Max app.</p><p>As a relatively new Warner Bros. leader, Zaslav likely wanted to make a mark with a service of his very own. (Media executives just can't help themselves, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-08-quibi-mobile-video-turnstyle.html\">remember Jeffrey Katzenberg's Quibi</a>?) So long HBO Max, hello something that combines HBO's prestigious content with Discovery's vast library of unscripted reality shows. During today's media event, Warner Bros. executives stressed that the company wanted to highlight HBO's world-renowned branding \u2014 \"HBO is not TV, HBO is HBO!\" someone proclaimed boldly. But they also hinted that the company didn't want to stuff too much into \"HBO\" as a concept.</p><div id=\"84018c6a5fca4fc1b8cb5fac12b98031\"><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>I also bet that Zaslav and crew talked to plenty of advisors and focus groups who made it clear that HBO would never be considered as family-friendly as Disney. A cautious parent may not want to subscribe to an HBO service, even if it was the only way to watch a new Discovery series for kids. As one WB executive pointed out, the company used to see double-digit shares of kids programming across their many networks, but that's \"virtually disappeared\" in the streaming era.</p><p>With the Max refresh, Warner Bros. is trying to fix many of HBO Max's underlying problems. The company says it's aiming to increase engagement (having a ton of new content helps!), enhance retention, strengthen performance and optimize monetization. A carousel of personalized recommendations should help to surface content users may ignore, and WB says Max will also be able to alert people if their subscription payments fail. These are basic features for any modern subscription service, so it's shocking to learn that HBO Max couldn't manage them on its own.</p><div id=\"fb0a2372c812418a80cdf8d732016a89\"><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>Of course, WB is also trying to \"optimize monetization\" by raising the subscription cost for 4K viewers. If you want to see <em>Game of Thrones</em> or the upcoming <em>Flash</em> movie in 4K, you'll need to spend $4 more for Max's \"Ultimate tier.\" That's similar to Netflix's 4K strategy, so it's not entirely surprising, but it's still annoying.&nbsp;</p><p>Let me be truly cynical: It doesn't really matter what Max is called. We're awash in terribly-named streaming services, like Peacock and Paramount+. It would have been nice to see WB highlight one of its most prominent properties, but lopping off the first half of HBO Max probably makes more sense than trying to hype up another ridiculous media name (Hulu somehow made it work, but Quibi will forever sound dumb).&nbsp;</p><p>No matter what it's called, we'll still rush to Max to catch the latest episode of <em>Succession</em> or <em>The Last of Us</em>. In this era of streaming networks dumping mountains of content on us, it's somewhat refreshing to have premium shows airing weekly. That gives us time to truly absorb major events (like the most recent <em>Succession</em> shocker), and space to anticipate what comes next. Ultimately, that's HBO's superpower, and Zaslav knows it. When combined with the onslaught of cheap and addictive content from Discovery, he might be able to turn Max into a true Disney+ competitor.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/max-hbo-max-rebrand-analysis-194800553.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/max-hbo-max-rebrand-analysis-194800553.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-12 19:48:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Philips' new 'Ultra Efficient' LED bulbs use 40 percent less energy", "description": "<p>LED light bulbs are already supposed to be energy-efficient, but Signifiy thinks it can improve on the formula.

In a <a href=\"https://thesoc.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/SOC_In-Denial_Amazon-Injury-Report-April-2023.pdf\"><ins>report released on Wednesday</ins></a> (PDF link), the Strategic Organizing Center (SOC) said data collected by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) shows Amazon warehouse workers continue to suffer injuries more frequently than their non-Amazon counterparts. It also claims those injuries were often more severe.</p><p>In 2022, Amazon reported a total of 38,609 recordable injuries. Per the SOC, those are incidents that require a worker to either take time off from their regular job or seek medical treatment beyond first aid. Of those injuries, 95 percent were those the organization considers serious either because Amazon had to temporarily reassign the worker to a less strenuous role or give them time off to recover.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>After crunching the data, the SOC found Amazon\u2019s total injury rate in 2022 was 6.9 injuries per 100 workers. Comparatively, that\u2019s a better rate than the 7.9 injuries per 100 workers the company recorded last year, and the staggering nine injuries per 100 workers the SOC says Amazon managed in 2019, but the organization contends the data shows Amazon \u201cfailed to make meaningful progress on worker safety.\u201d Specifically, the SOC points to the rate at which Amazon workers suffered \u201cserious\u201d injuries. At 6.6 per 100 workers, the organization says Amazon\u2019s 2022 serious injury rate is 12 percent higher than the one the company recorded in 2020 and more than double the rate seen at non-Amazon warehouses last year.</p><p>Put another way, the SOC claims more than half of all serious US warehouse injuries in 2022 occured at Amazon, despite the company only employing 36 percent of all US warehouse workers last year. \u201cFor a corporation that prides itself on moving quickly and decisively informed by sophisticated data analysis, Amazon\u2019s ongoing failure to provide safe working conditions raises major questions about whether the company\u2019s management is serious about becoming \u2018earth\u2019s safest place to work,\u2019 or whether it continues to put profits before the safety of the very people responsible for its success,\u201d the report states.</p><p>Amazon disputes the Strategic Organizing Center\u2019s interpretation of the data it shared with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Specifically, it takes issue with SOC\u2019s use of \u201cserious injury rate,\u201d noting it\u2019s not an official OSHA metric. The agency does track when a workplace injury requires a worker to either change roles or take time off. However, Amazon contends that metric \u2013 known as DART or \u201cdays away, restricted, or transferred rates\u201d \u2013 is not shorthand for a serious injury. It claims DART metrics often incorporate \u201crelatively minor\u201d injuries. Instead, the company says critics should look at its recordable injuries and how long workers have taken off to recover from workplace incidents. When you look at those numbers, Amazon says the <a href=\"https://safety.aboutamazon.com/\"><ins>data shows</ins></a> it has made significant progress in recent years.</p><p>\u201cThe safety and health of our employees is, and always will be, our top priority, and any claim otherwise is inaccurate.

In the <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/04/07/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-22621-1546-and-22624-1546/\"><ins>latest</ins></a> Windows 11 Insider Preview builds, however, pressing the button launches the more versatile Snipping Tool instead.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/how-to-take-a-screenshot-on-any-device-163053556.html\">Snipping Tool</a> enables users to capture a section of their screen, rather than the entire display (although that's still an option). You can capture everything in a single window or just a portion of what you see, thanks to the rectangular and freeform modes.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>While the Snipping Tool has more utility than Print Screen's traditional function, power users may not benefit much from the switch. The Print Screen button is out of the way on most keyboards and, for many people, it may be easier to continue using the existing Snipping Tool shortcut (Win key + Shift + S). The Xbox Game Bar app can instantly save a screenshot without any extra steps, though you'll still need to move your hand over to the Print Screen button (the shortcut combo is Win key + Alt + Print Screen).&nbsp;</p><p>As <a href=\"https://betanews.com/2023/04/11/microsoft-is-changing-the-function-of-the-print-screen-key-in-windows-11/\"><em><ins>BetaNews</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>notes, those who aren't happy with the change will be able to revert the Print Screen button's role to the same thing it's been doing for decades through their system's accessibility settings. Moreover, if you've already assigned a custom function to the key, Windows 11 won't automatically change that.</p><p>Microsoft is testing the change at the minute and, depending on user feedback, it may reverse course and keep the Print Screen's function as is in retail builds of Windows 11. Still, expanding what the key can do may make it more useful for many folks.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-is-testing-a-way-to-make-the-print-screen-button-more-useful-143011706.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-is-testing-a-way-to-make-the-print-screen-button-more-useful-143011706.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-12 14:30:11+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The best sous vide machines for 2023", "description": "<p>Learning how to cook sous vide (which translates literally to \u201cunder vacuum\u201d in French) can be intimidating. Not only do you need to have a sous vide machine (aka an immersion circulator), some people will also say you need additional equipment like a vacuum sealer, special plastic bags and more. And while those things do help, they\u2019re not 100 percent necessary and they shouldn\u2019t scare you off one of the best and most accurate ways of cooking, especially proteins like meat and fish.</p><p>The hard part, though, is choosing the right device for you, as sous vide machines are relatively recent newcomers to home kitchens. After all, the first immersion circulator priced under <a href=\"https://www.americastestkitchen.com/cooksillustrated/articles/1142-the-history-of-sous-vide-explained\">$500 went on sale in 2009</a>. Prior to that, these devices were typically only found in high-end restaurants or as playthings for celebrity chefs. So if you want to see which sous vide machine can up your cooking game, take a look at our picks for the best devices you can buy right now.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><h2>What we look for</h2><p>While they might have a fancy name, the main things we look for in a quality sous vide machine are quite straightforward: ease-of-use, reliability and a good design. It should be easy to clean and have clear, no-nonsense controls. It should also have some way of attaching to a tank or pot so it doesn\u2019t become dislodged during use. And most importantly, it should have a strong heating element and motor that can deliver consistent water temperatures to ensure your food hits the correct level of doneness every time.</p><h2>The best overall: Anova Precision Cooker</h2><p></p><p>Anova is one of the oldest names in the game. I\u2019ve personally been using one of their older models for almost seven years and it\u2019s still going strong. However, on the latest version of the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Bbm92YS1DdWxpbmFyeS1BTjUwMC1VUzAwLVByZWNpc2lvbi1JbmNsdWRlZC9kcC9CMDdXUTRNNVRTP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXNoLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0MDgzOGE4OC0wNmE0LTQzNWItYjU4Ny05ZjdmYjdhNDc0NTUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAW7t4VMEgalOOCbv7Yi8__mjdagtPyyaR8z2wBOMxQcJ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAnova-Culinary-AN500-US00-Precision-Included%2Fdp%2FB07WQ4M5TS\">Anova Precision Cooker</a> you get a number of handy upgrades like digital touch controls, a longer power cord, a water-resistant IPX7 design and even Wi-Fi connectivity. And with a flow rate of eight liters per minute, it can heat up water faster than less expensive competitors.</p><p>But perhaps the best part is that, thanks to a collaboration with chef <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=89f68c82-f255-44fa-8db9-03fec996b93a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YouTube&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4OWY2OGM4Mi1mMjU1LTQ0ZmEtOGRiOS0wM2ZlYzk5NmI5M2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vQEpLZW5qaUxvcGV6QWx0IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0MDgzOGE4OC0wNmE0LTQzNWItYjU4Ny05ZjdmYjdhNDc0NTUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAWYjPE6ll_2drjf7qrhNtebIbUhYe3EShPT3UP_SasWY&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2F%40JKenjiLopezAlt\">J. Kenji Lopez-Alt</a>, the Anova app has one of the largest collections of tried and tested sous vide recipes from any manufacturer. So not only is it easy to use, the Anova Precision Cooker can help you find a ton of tasty dishes to try</p><p>Alternatively, if you like Anova\u2019s devices but want something a bit more compact, consider the Precision Cooker Nano 3.0. Priced at $149, it\u2019s a bit more expensive than the standard model but you still get all the most important features including dual-band Wi-Fi connectivity, a two-line touchscreen and onboard controls so you don\u2019t need to ever pair your phone to the Nano if you don\u2019t want to.</p><h2>Our upgrade pick: Breville Joule Sous Vide</h2><p></p><p>If you want a more sophisticated immersion circulator, <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9DaGVmU3RlcHMtSm91bGUtV2F0dHMtV2hpdGUtU3RhaW5sZXNzL2RwL0IwMU04TU1MQkkvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXNoLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI0MDgzOGE4OC0wNmE0LTQzNWItYjU4Ny05ZjdmYjdhNDc0NTUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAY_dvWo5OJzP8V2yWLAdrFJ08yY1M25bQLLAJAMoiMXh&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FChefSteps-Joule-Watts-White-Stainless%2Fdp%2FB01M8MMLBI%2F\">Breville\u2019s Joule Sous Vide</a> is a great choice. It has a slick, compact design, which is great for people with smaller kitchens, and because its motor is located at the very base of the device, you don\u2019t need to use as much water to cook. So instead of requiring a huge dedicated tank, you can simply fill a three or four-quart pot with water and go from there. On top of that, because it has a magnetic base, it can clamp to the bottom of a pot without needing a separate clip or stand. It also supports both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity. The one downside is that because it doesn\u2019t have onboard temperature controls, you need to pair it with your phone and use Breville\u2019s free companion app every time you want to use it.</p><h2>The best budget immersion circulator: Inkbird Sous Vide Precision Cooker (ISV-200W)</h2><p></p><p>For those who want to try out sous vide cooking without dropping a bunch of money, <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9JbmtiaXJkLVByZWNpc2lvbi1DaXJjdWxhdG9yLUNvbXBvbmVudHMtVGVtcGVyYXR1cmUvZHAvQjA4R0tRRlQ2Qi8_dGg9MSZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1zaC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNDA4MzhhODgtMDZhNC00MzViLWI1ODctOWY3ZmI3YTQ3NDU1In0&amp;signature=AQAAARc7vAYgYfyCw5MKiI4hIuMRJdH1zoPJO9mc5yec6WY2&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FInkbird-Precision-Circulator-Components-Temperature%2Fdp%2FB08GKQFT6B%2F%3Fth%3D1\">Inkbird\u2019s Precision Cooker</a> is a great entry-level choice. While it\u2019s not quite as powerful or fancy as more expensive rivals, it covers all the bases for just under $90 (and it\u2019s often on sale for even less). Not only do you get a built-in screen with Wi-Fi connectivity, the Inkbird has a powerful heating element with a 0.1-degree Celsius accuracy. Cooking temps range from 77 degrees Fahrenheit to 210 degrees and with a timer setting that goes up to 99 hours, you can try to recreate some of those super long, multi-day recipes like you\u2019ve seen on YouTube in your own kitchen.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-sous-vide-133025288.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/best-sous-vide-133025288.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-12 13:30:25+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Samsung's Galaxy S23 Ultra is down to $1,000 right now", "description": "<p>Don't worry if you were put off by the initially high price of the Galaxy S23 Ultra.

Now it's down to $599 with the new RTX 4070, a mid-range card focused on 1440p gaming. While it's $100 more than its predecessor's launch price, the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-rtx-3070-review-ray-tracing-130052152.html\">fabulous RTX 3070</a>, that card typically sold for more than $1,000 due to the supply chain crunch, scalpers and insatiable crypto bros. Based on what we've seen from the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-rtx-4070-ti-review-3090-ti-power-for-799-140001316.html\">4070 Ti</a>, NVIDIA's new cards are actually staying close to their retail price, which is great news for anyone itching for an upgrade.</p><p>Judging from <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/videocard/\">Valve's Steam hardware statistics</a>, I'd wager many gamers are waiting on the eventual RTX 4060 before giving up their old cards, especially if it ends up selling closer to $400. But based on my testing, the 4070 is still a solid choice for practical gamers who may wan to splurge a bit. It's fast enough to deliver excellent 1440p performance <em>with</em> ray tracing enabled, and it can even deliver solid 4K gaming in a pinch too. Even though it's noticeably slower than the $799 RTX 4070 Ti in most benchmarks, that may not matter much when you're actually in the heat of battle. (Just think of all you could do with that extra $200!)</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The RTX 4070 features NVIDIA's new Ada Lovelace architecture, sporting 5,888 CUDA cores, a base clock speed of 1,920 MHz (boost to 2,475 MHz) and 16GB of GDDR6X RAM. The 3070, meanwhile, had the same amount of CUDA cores, but it was based on NVIDIA's older Ampere architecture. It could only reach up to 1,725 MHz and had 8GB of slower GDDR6 memory. Despite those differences, the 3070 still holds up well, so I wouldn't rush out to replace it anytime soon. But if you're still holding onto an RTX 20-series GPU or something older, the 4070 may be the GPU you've been waiting for.</p><figure><img alt=\"NVIDIA RTX 4070 port view\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/5449ac01-d8e8-11ed-9fef-4b58ea4832e6\" style=\"height: 1066px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>We received the RTX 4070 Founder's Edition card from NVIDIA, which basically looks like a shrunken down version of the 4080 and 4090. It feels like a premium card, with a sleek metal case, a bevy of heatsink fins and two large fans to deal with heat. It's also a two-slot GPU, like the 4070 Ti, allowing it to fit inside of smaller cases far better than the enormous 4080 and 4090. Port-wise, there are three DisplayPort connections and a single HDMI. As with all of NVIDIA's recent cards, it also includes an adapter to connect two 8-pin PCIe power cables (a single PCIe Gen 5 cable will also work).</p><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><p>3DMark TimeSpy Extreme</p></td><td><p>Port Royal (Ray Tracing)</p></td><td><p>Cyberpunk</p></td><td><p>Blender</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>NVIDIA RTX 4070</p></td><td><p>8,610</p></td><td><p>11,195/52 fps</p></td><td><p>1440p RT DLSS: 120 fps</p></td><td><p>6,020</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti</p></td><td><p>10,624</p></td><td><p>14,163/66 fps</p></td><td><p>1440p RT DLSS : 135 fps</p></td><td><p>7,247</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>NVIDIA RTX 3070</p></td><td><p>6,226</p></td><td><p>8,032/37 fps</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td><td><p>3,500</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT</p></td><td><p>11,688</p></td><td><p>13,247/61 fps</p></td><td><p>1440p FSRT RT: 114 fps</p></td><td><p>3,516</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Once I started benching and playing games with the RTX 4070, it performed just as I expected: Somewhere between the RTX 3080 (which launched at $699) and the 3080 Ti ($1,119). The difference, though, is that it supports NVIDIA's DLSS 3 technology, which can help speed up ray tracing performance by inserting AI-generated frames. I was particularly impressed by how well it handled <em>Cyberpunk</em> 2077: in 1440p with maxed out graphics and \"ultra\" ray tracing settings, it delivered a smooth 120 fps. The RTX 3070, in comparison, struggled to hold 75 fps with the same settings using the older DLSS 2, which doesn't use frame generation.</p><p><em>Control</em>, an older title that only supports DLSS 2, had a less dramatic performance bump with the 4070. While playing in 1440p with maxed graphics and all of its ray tracing settings flipped on, it reached 106 fps, compared to 90 fps with the 3070. Still, it's a bit of a shock to see a mid-range card scoring triple digit frame rates with all of the game's ray tracing features enabled (which includes reflections, shadows and debris). Not too long ago, <em>Control </em>used to humble the mightiest video cards.</p><section><img alt=\"NVIDIA RTX 4070 rear profile\" class=\"e2ehero-url\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/544a9660-d8e8-11ed-be7d-8c7ffb020206\" style=\"height: 1129px; width: 2000px;\" /></section><p>NVIDIA is clearly positioning the 4070 as a 1440p-focused card, but it can still handle some 4K scenarios, so long as you're not too demanding. It hovered at 70 fps in <em>Cyberpunk</em> with maxed graphics and \"ultra\" ray tracing settings \u2014 that's certainly better than you'd see on any modern game console. <em>Control</em>, meanwhile, hit 56 fps on average. If you're only dabbling in 4K occasionally, perhaps for a lazy Sunday session on your TV, that's not too bad.&nbsp;</p><p>As with all of NVIDIA's new hardware, the RTX 4070 is also a useful tool for streamers and media creators thanks to its hardware-based AV1 encoder. The company claims it's around 40 percent more efficient than the previous generation H.264 encoder \u2014 that means it'll take less bandwidth to deliver clear streams, a boon for anyone who wants to show off 1440p or 4K streams. The popular broadcast software OBS will soon be updated to support AV1 streaming to YouTube, which offers some dramatic clarity boons, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1674202/the-future-of-gpu-streaming-is-here-youtube-adds-av1-support.html\">according to </a><a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1674202/the-future-of-gpu-streaming-is-here-youtube-adds-av1-support.html\"><em>PCWorld</em></a><em>. </em>When it comes to typical H.264 encoding, the 4070 converted 4K test clip to 1080p in 33 seconds, three seconds longer than the 4070 Ti.</p><figure><img alt=\"NVIDIA RTX 4070 front fan\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/5448c1a0-d8e8-11ed-93b6-faa186c5b568\" style=\"height: 1223px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Thanks to the 4070's excellent cooling setup and relatively modest power demands (it requires a 650W PSU), its temperature never climb above 70 Celsius during my testing. I could only hear its two fans when I spent more than 30 minutes in a game using ray tracing. But really, it's not anything that'll distract you during gameplay.</p><p>Now that we've seen NVIDIA's RTX 4070 in action, is it actually worth $599? For anyone with a GPU older than the RTX 30-series, I'd say so. (Though if you can spare an extra $200, the 4070 Ti is noticeably better.) A few years ago, we were hoping and praying for GPU prices to come back down to Earth. We've seen 4070 Ti cards stick close to its initial $799 launch price, so there's a good chance you'll actually be able to find a 4070 this year without overpaying too much. To be smart, it's worth waiting a few months for the 4060 to drop before you make any decisions.&nbsp;</p><p>But if you've been hankering for better framerates and playable ray tracing, go with the gaming gods. The RTX 4070 is the new king of mid-range GPUs.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-rtx-4070-review-the-new-1440p-gaming-leader-130010874.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-rtx-4070-review-the-new-1440p-gaming-leader-130010874.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-12 13:00:10+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 4070 comes with 12GB of RAM for $599", "description": "<p>True to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nvidias-geforce-rtx-4070-will-reportedly-cost-599-210058860.html\">the leaks</a>, NVIDIA has unveiled the standard GeForce RTX 4070 \u2014 and it might hit the sweet spot, provided you're willing to accept the price hikes that have defined the RTX 40 lineup. The $599 desktop GPU is considered a successor to the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-rtx-3070-ti-review-2070-super-replacement-130036224.html\">RTX 3070 Ti</a> and offers a similar 5,888 CUDA cores, but adds more RAM (12GB instead of 8GB), higher clock speeds (1.92GHz base versus 1.58GHz), more level 2 cache (36MB compared to 4MB) and greater floating point computing power (29 teraflops versus 22). At the same time, it reduces the typical gaming power consumption from 290W to 200W. Some games quickly ran into the 8GB ceiling of RTX 3070 variants, so the extra memory alone may have a significant effect.</p><p>NVIDIA pitches the RTX 4070 as ideal for 1440p gaming at over 100 frames per second with ray tracing turned on, although you'll have to enable <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-dlss-3-ada-lovelace-160404110.html\">DLSS3 upscaling</a> to hit that target. While many games don't support the feature yet (over 50 do so far), this might make it feasible to play big titles like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Spider-Man: Miles Morales</em> at maximum visual detail without compromising on frame rates.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The RTX 4070 will be available tomorrow, April 13th, and will include a Founders Edition card from NVIDIA itself. In other words, the $599 price is more likely to reflect what you can actually buy. You might not have to pay extra for a vendor's factory-overclocked board or otherwise accept artificial markups.</p><p>Whether or not the new GPU is a good deal depends on your perspective. NVIDIA sees the RTX 4070 as an upgrade path for users coming from a GTX 1080 or RTX 2070. You're paying similar money for a major leap in performance. It's also decidedly more affordable than the $799 <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-rtx-4070-ti-review-3090-ti-power-for-799-140001316.html\">RTX 4070 Ti</a>. However, the new model still costs $100 more than the base 3070. Like it or not, the days of sub-$500 upper mid-range cards appear to be over in NVIDIA's world.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/nvidias-geforce-rtx-4070-comes-with-12gb-of-ram-for-599-130002404.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/nvidias-geforce-rtx-4070-comes-with-12gb-of-ram-for-599-130002404.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-12 13:00:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The Environmental Protection Agency proposes stricter vehicle emission rules", "description": "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/04/12/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-proposes-new-standards-to-protect-public-health-that-will-save-consumers-money-and-increase-energy-security/\">Biden-Harris administration has proposed stricter pollution standards</a> across the auto industry as part of their goal to increase EV production and slow climate change.

In California, EVs made up almost <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/zero-emission-vehicles-made-up-nearly-19-percent-of-car-sales-in-california-last-year-182852495.html\">19 percent of yearly new car sales</a>. That upswing is set to continue in 2023 with 225,000 EVs sold in the first quarter \u2014 about seven percent of all new vehicles. The same period saw <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/used-us-electric-vehicle-sales-jump-prices-fall-group-2023-04-07/\">used EV purchases increase by almost a third</a>, thanks potentially to their prices decreasing.</p><p>At the same time, cost is still a huge barrier for making EVs mainstream. Last year, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/president-joe-biden-signs-inflation-reduction-act-200724230.html\">President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act</a>, providing EV buyers subsidies up to $7,500 for SUVs, trucks, and vans under $80,000 and cars under $55,000. Even used EV purchases could get up to $4,000. Recent updated guidance from the US Treasury Department, however, limited how many <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/stricter-guidance-means-fewer-evs-will-qualify-for-7500-federal-tax-credit-180350889.html\">EVs would qualify for a subsidy</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Another issue is making sure people have somewhere to charge all these EVs while they're on the go. Currently, there are 130,000 public charging stations across the United States, with President Biden aiming to tackle demand by<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/us-government-opens-25-billion-in-funding-for-community-ev-chargers-213048517.html\"> building another 500,000 by 2030</a>. Part of this plan entails teaming with local officials to build them in widely accessible spaces, with regional governments needing to apply for funds by May 30th. If all goes well, no one would live farther than 50 miles from a charger.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-environmental-protection-agency-proposes-stricter-vehicle-emission-rules-123026451.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/the-environmental-protection-agency-proposes-stricter-vehicle-emission-rules-123026451.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-12 12:30:26+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The Morning After: Biden administration wants help making rules for AI models like ChatGPT", "description": "<p>ChatGPT, Bard and Bing AI: You can\u2019t escape the AI models and chatbot evolution and headlines.
