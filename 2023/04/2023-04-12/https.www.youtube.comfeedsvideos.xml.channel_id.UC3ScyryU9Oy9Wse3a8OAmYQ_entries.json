Bush, played out during President Barack Obama\u2019s tenure. The documentary examines how a pattern of Afghan civilian casualties incurred during raids and other errant attacks severely undercut the U.S. military\u2019s effort to win \u201chearts and minds\u201d in the country, how U.S. efforts to train Afghan forces ran up against corruption and low morale and how the Taliban regained ground in Afghanistan.\n\nWatch Parts One and Two now.
