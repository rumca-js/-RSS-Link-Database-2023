<p>My newly mindful driving may cause fury in those stuck behind me, but I find it much more enjoyable and less stressful</p><p>I’ve never been a particularly fast driver. I can’t have been, because in four decades at the wheel, driving far too many miles every year, I’ve only been nicked three times for speeding. Once was in 1985 doing 65mph in a 40mph limit on the A456 just outside Halesowen. I was in my dad’s car, wearing mirrored sunglasses, which I decided not to remove when the police officer addressed me. Idiot. (Me, not the copper.) Perhaps he saw his own irritated reflection as he issued the reprimand. I got a fine no bigger than the speed I was doing, and three richly deserved points. It should have been more.</p><p>The second time was more recently, on the Adriatic coast road in Croatia. An outstretched arm, palm facing towards me, indicated I should stop. On this occasion I removed my sunglasses; the <em>policajac</em> didn’t. After a brief admonishment and a spot of form-filling, his arm was outstretched again – now with his palm facing upwards, indicating I should put some cash in it. This I did. Job done.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/12/nicked-three-times-for-speeding-life-in-slow-lane-revelation-adrian-chiles">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Try as it might, the Food and Drug Administration cannot escape the abortion debate. The agency must be bolder</p><p>On Friday, the nation was treated to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/04/07/texas-abortion-pill-ruling-mifepristone/">dueling decisions</a> from federal judges regarding the first drug in a medication abortion: mifepristone. A judge in Texas ruled that the Food and drug Administration (FDA) likely improperly approved the drug, staying its approval while the case plays out. Minutes later, a judge in Washington state ruled that the FDA could not change the status quo regarding mifepristone’s availability.</p><p>In response to these two cases and two other less-publicized cases involving the FDA and medication abortion, the agency needs to chart a course consistent with its mission to protect patient health and to follow the evidence. As the Biden administration has <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/01/22/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-sign-presidential-memorandum-on-ensuring-safe-access-to-medication-abortion/">stated</a>, protecting medication abortion is a public health imperative now that states can ban all abortion outright.

Pinging haphazardly and often nonsensically around central and eastern Europe, this trashy runaround sees French action specialist Camille Delamarre (Brick Mansions, The Transporter Refuelled) emerging from sometime mentor Luc Besson’s shadow, for better or worse. Liberated from Besson’s more questionable fetishes but also untethered from a healthy line of credit, the result never rises above generic multiplex filler. Everyone is travelling economy, with a tatty script stuffed way down, out of shame, in their carry-on luggage.</p><p>After doing for an assailant who attacks him and his schoolmarm girlfriend, nice-guy assassin Morgan (Henry Golding) learns he’s been unknowingly entered in effectively a hitpersons’ Champions League. On the plus side, it provides the perfect opportunity to deploy the improbably wide-ranging personal surveillance network he maintains from his shabby digs. Sam Neill is Morgan’s urbane handler, found tickling the harpsichord at one point; Noomi Rapace occupies a botched dual role, requiring her to alternate between big specs as the head of some security agency and blond frosting as the most vicious of Morgan’s rivals. The casting is simpler elsewhere: grizzled ex-doormen abound.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/12/assassin-club-review">Continue reading...</a>

## Cooking oil, Grandpap’s cou-cou stick and a quilt – how I recreated Black portraits and celebrated the stories of people of colour

<p>As an opera singer, I’m used to breathing life into characters. During lockdown I took on a challenge to reimagine great artworks in my home – and so brought Black history to life and explored what it means to take up space as a Black man</p><p>As <a href="https://www.peterbrathwaitebaritone.com/">a Black British opera singer,</a> I am used to being a rare breed – still. Moreover, I am accustomed to having quizzical glances cast in my direction, as if I am something of a novelty or a curious anomaly. A large part of my musical career to date has been based on balancing and reconciling the tricky dichotomy of otherness in relation to myself and the canon of western classical music that I love and love to perform. And given that they are so few and far between, representations of people who look like me in the classical canon have always been of interest. As a student of opera, I clung to the album covers of the African American soprano Leontyne Price and a black-and-white postcard portrait of the Black British composer Samuel Coleridge-Taylor. These totemic images, my superheroes, became talismanic, protective figures when I found myself on the receiving end of everyday racism from fellow musicians – things like “You’re the whitest Black man I know,”, or “Your performance was so good, I thought you were a white singer blacked up,” or “You would have been a slave when this opera was written.” Or the time a singing coach put her finger in my mouth because she just didn’t understand how I, “a Negro,” could have an alveolar ridge.</p><p>In opera, I have been cast as an enslaved African man twice. Both times turned out to be opportunities to humanise Black characters that have all too often existed on the stage as one-dimensional stereotypes. With one of these roles in particular – the enslaved African Kaidamà in Gaetano Donizetti’s Il furioso all’isola di San Domingo, a 19th-century opera set in the Caribbean – there was an urgent need to restore agency to an operatic character who has been portrayed in blackface well into the 21st century. This is a “tradition” that has done much to distort the dignity of Black lives.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/12/recreating-black-portraits-history-peter-brathwaite-getty-lockdown-challenge">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I’m getting pelted by ‘low-hanging fruit’ and trapped in a vortex of ‘deliverables’. Can I get a Google Generational Translator?</p><p>We’re 45 min into the job interview and I’ve heard the word “literally” 27 times. And don’t even get me started on “pivot.” I’m about to pivot my 53-year-old keister out of this freakin’ interview. <em>Literally</em>. Never mind that I need an interpreter to understand 75% of what this communications director has been talking about since we started the interview.</p><p>I applied to this opening for a “creative services manager” two weeks ago, confident that my more than two decades as a graphic designer would qualify me. Following a rocky 2.5-hour call with HR (that I mistook for the actual interview), followed by a perplexing assessment test (that had nothing to do with the job description), my optimism is waning.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/12/banished-to-boomer-island-tales-of-a-menopausal-gen-xer-for-hire">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Even in the realms of extreme, it’s extreme’: how UK music festivals are planning for freak weather

<p>Whether waterlogged from flooding or parched and prone to wildfires, festival sites are having to plan for every eventuality – and the costs are substantial</p><p>Wellies and sun hats are the traditional first guard against the elements at festivals, but this summer they may not be enough to protect revellers. Flood defences, wildfire response teams and satellite weather-monitoring technology are among the ways UK music festivals are adapting to extreme weather events fuelled by the climate crisis.</p><p>Last summer’s record high temperatures in the UK hit during festival season, and the changing climate has become one of the industry’s biggest challenges, increasing the frequency, severity and likelihood of weather such as heatwaves and thunderstorms. With preparations underway for this year’s festival season, event organisers are increasing their contingency plans to secure their events, at a time of higher costs in labour, energy and insurance.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/12/freak-weather-affecting-music-festivals-standon-calling">Continue reading...</a>

<p>At eight, I was sent from England to live with relatives in Goa for four years. The experience shook me out of my timid existence and led to a profound sense of belonging</p><p>In 1984, I boarded a musty Air India plane with my aunt, leaving my parents and baby sister in the south of England, and flew to live with my maternal grandparents in a tiny fishing town south of Goa. At a time when many Indians were emigrating to Britain in search of a more prosperous life, I seemed to be the only brown person going in the other direction.</p><p>I was eight years old. I was being sent to India to get up to speed with the language (Kannada) before my family followed, as we were planning to relocate from England. It would only be for a few months, I was assured. The separation ended up lasting four years because the big move never materialised.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/12/a-moment-that-changed-me-i-was-separated-from-my-parents-and-it-gave-me-inner-strength">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Frank Lampard wants to emulate Roberto Di Matteo’s 2012 win but beating the kings of Europe is the toughest assignment</p><p>They would have to call it The Miracle of Frank Lampard. It would be the barely plausible tale of the man who was guiding Everton into the Championship landing a new job three months later and, in defiance of all logic, being summoned to rescue the club he knows best before masterminding a series of staggering upsets and ending the campaign as the interim head coach who led Chelsea to the most unlikely of Champions League triumphs.</p><p>It would be the latest example of football’s ability to surprise and bewilder. It would be romance over reality, an invocation of the spirit of 2012, the kind of content ripe to be packaged into a 10-part Netflix documentary.

My life has been defined by wars, violent sanctions, and a US/UK occupation that caused insurmountable tragedy to my life and to the lives of millions of others.

<p>This starry vampire caper borrows from the best bits of Hollywood monster movies and features some truly resplendent gore, but its tone and its morals are a bit off</p><p>The 1988 movie Vampire’s Kiss, about a lonely lothario with delusions of vampirism, might have flopped at the box office, but it did help to establish Nicolas Cage’s idiosyncratic performance style. Inevitably, he’s now brought his eye-popping instincts and shouty charisma to the role of Count Dracula – with most pleasing results.</p><p>Cage’s Dracula doesn’t have top billing here, however; that goes to his longtime servant, played as a meek-but-mighty Englishman by Nicholas Hoult. In this telling, Renfield’s bug-eating is the source of his super-strength, not a mark of madness, and he wants out of what he sees as an abusive relationship with his over-demanding boss. But breaking free is complicated by a blossoming romance with Rebecca Quincy (Awkwafina), a New Orleans cop determined to bring a local crime family to justice.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/12/renfield-review-gory-fun-as-nicolas-cage-gets-his-teeth-into-dracula">Continue reading...</a>
