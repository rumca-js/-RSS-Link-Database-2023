In comparison, this remade version of The Awakened feels far more like an inferior throwback to old-fashioned point-and-click adventures where trial and error was just as effective an approach as logic and reason, making its forensic deductions feel more like foregone conclusions. This wouldn\u2019t be so bad if its Lovecraft-inspired mystery was compelling enough to sustain interest in its run-of-the-mill casework, but unfortunately it fumbles that too, with its hamfisted attempts at horror more likely to tickle ribs than raise hairs.
