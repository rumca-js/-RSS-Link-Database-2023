Which sounds like a pretty rad condition - though I prefer wine myself. But it's actually not as fun as it sounds. </p><p>Forty-year-old Mark Mongiardo of <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-gavin-newsom-california\" target=\"_blank\">Florida</a> says he has the rare condition, dubbed \"auto-brewery syndrome,\" which causes an imbalance of microbiota to convert sugar to alcohol in his gut. It can be caused by a poor diet or antibiotic use.</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cI have a rare condition that causes my body to produce BEER https://t.co/X1Gb7vv61y\\u201d</div> \u2014 Daily Mail Online (@Daily Mail Online)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MailOnline/status/1642014590731943937\">1680321760</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The syndrome causes Mark to appear drunk even when he hasn't had a drop of alcohol. He used to be a schoolteacher, but lost his job due to his constant state of apparent drunkeness. His bosses accused him of \"smelling like beer\" at school, which he probably did - but the scent was coming from the sugars in his gut. </p><p>He even got pulled over twice for \"drunk-driving,\" telling <a href=\"https://www.today.com/health/disease/man-shares-auto-brewery-syndrome-symptoms-rcna77263\" target=\"_blank\">TODAY</a>: <em>\"<span></span>'For years, [my wife] thought I was hiding drinking and I would come home each day and I would basically be drunk. I had symptoms of being intoxicated from slurring speech to balance issues. And this happened even at social events where I had not been drinking.'</em></p><p>He \"lost everything\" after the second time getting pulled over:<em> \"I had to sell my house, I had to sell my car. I couldn't get a job in education, I couldn't get a job at the grocery store. I had pending felony charges. You know, I was facing prison time for two DWI's when I had not been drinking.\"</em></p><p>To keep the syndrome under wraps, Mongiardo has to take 30 tablets of medication per day and eat an extreme low-carb diet, no pizza or pasta allowed. He takes a breathalyzer before every drive and now works at Target. </p><p>But there is some good news - the felony charges were dropped after the police took too long to bring them to trial. And at least now he and his family have a diagnosis. I can't imagine how bizarre and troubling it would be to never drink, but constantly feel and appear drunk. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Lily is a Zoomer college dropout who somehow landed a writing gig here at LwC.com.

British farmers will soon be ordered to feed their cows \"methane suppressants\" to prevent their stinky burps and farts from polluting the environment. Priorities, people. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cFarmers will be ordered to feed cows 'methane suppressants' under net zero plans \\n https://t.co/trNlq9UOj9\\u201d</div> \u2014 Daily Mail Online (@Daily Mail Online)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MailOnline/status/1642466040079691778\">1680429394</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The suppressants are apparently \"compound feeds\" that contain seaweed, essential oils, organic acids, probiotics, and antimicrobials that apparently reduce the amount of methane produced during a cow\u2019s digestion. These suppressants could be introduced in 2025 \"at pace,\" or as \"soon as practically possible.\" </p><p>This is all part of the effort to reduce emissions by 20% by 2030, as required by Britain's commitment to the Global Methane Pledge. The methane suppressant addition came after concerns that the governments existing plans to reach \"net-zero carbon\" by 2050 were not detailed enough. </p><p>Oh, and of course this will increase the cost of milk. But who cares about money, right? We've got a planet to save. From cow farts. And good news -former government advisor on food strategy Dustin Benton told The Telegraph that the feed could soon be given to sheep, too! Yaay!</p><p>He also said this is just the start and that more must be done to prevent the dastardly emissions that come from livestock. </p><p>Let's hope our beloved AOC doesn't get wind of this. Cow farts have been her nemesis for years now, challenged perhaps only by the lovely lady behind <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/aoc-libs-tiktok\" target=\"_blank\">Libs of TikTok</a>. Recall in 2019 she literally tried to ban cow farts in her <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/herere-8-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-idiotic-green-new-deal\" target=\"_blank\">Green New Deal:</a></p><p><em>\"We </em><em>set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren\u2019t sure that we\u2019ll be able to fully get rid of </em><strong>farting</strong><em> cows and airplanes that fast, but we think we can ramp up renewable manufacturing and power production, retrofit every building in America, build the smart grid, overhaul transportation and agriculture, plant lots of trees and restore our ecosystem to get to net-zero.\"</em></p><p>So, yeah.
