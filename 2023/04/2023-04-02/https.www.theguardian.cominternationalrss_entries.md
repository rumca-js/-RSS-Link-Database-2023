<p></p><p>The difference was that West Ham just looked a little bit cannier than Southampton in the areas that mattered. It was a dreadful game, high on tension and low on quality, but it was not a surprise that the points belonged to the more robust side.</p><p>Southampton, who had more of the ball and a few decent chances, had fallen short. West Ham, who needed the VAR to confirm that Nayef Aguerd’s winning goal was onside, had not impressed. But they had done enough.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/02/west-ham-southampton-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>(Polydor/Interscope)<br />The US indie-rock supergroup skewer the male ego on this magnificent meeting of harmonies and minds</p><p>“In another life we were arsonists,” goes a lyric on this first album from <a href="https://shopuk.xboygeniusx.com/">Boygenius</a>, the supergroup consisting of Julien Baker, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jul/30/phoebe-bridgers-o2-academy-brixton-london-live-review">Phoebe Bridgers</a> and Lucy Dacus – three of the most thoughtful, wry and quietly powerful indie-rock songwriters of the past decade. It’s a telling line for music that blazes with feeling, and is unabashed about drolly skewering and examining the male ego (see: songs about internalised notions of masculinity and lines such as “And I am not an old man having an existential crisis at a Buddhist monastery writing horny poetry” on a track called Leonard Cohen).</p><p>On the unassumingly titled <em>The </em><em>Record</em>, this formidable trio of singer-storytellers complement one another with their often harrowing, diary-like candour. When their strikingly pure vocals combine in folky, elegiac harmony they are extraordinary, as on the opener, Without You Without Them, or in starker, lyrical moments , when they address love, friendship, philosophy, self-effacement.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/02/boygenius-the-record-review-julien-baker-phoebe-bridgers-lucy-dacus">Continue reading...</a>

## If there’s one thing Italians won’t stomach, it’s dishing the dirt on their cuisine | Tobias Jones

Wisconsin parmesan and an academic’s claims over culinary purity have caused an outcry in the country<p>Food in Italy is an emotive, even metaphysical, subject. It’s through food (and wine) that Italians understand who they are and where they are from. Food is the central sacrament of family and of companionship, its simplicity providing an unbroken link to ancestors and soil. Its excellence proves that Italians really do have the best taste in the world.</p><p>That connection between Italians and their food has been cemented in popular culture. Paul Cicero (Paul Sorvino) in <em>Goodfellas</em> slices prison garlic with a razor blade; Joey Tribbiani in <em>Friends</em> loves nosh so much that he “doesn’t share food”. “Leave the gun, take the cannoli,” is one of the most famous lines in 20th-century cinema (from <em>The Godfather</em>) and TV schedules are full of presenters such as Stanley Tucci drooling over Italian food.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/02/one-thing-italians-wont-stomach-dishing-dirt-their-cuisine">Continue reading...</a>
