As a teenager, he liked the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, but his abiding passion was New York\u2019s underground avant garde art scene \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jan/30/fat-felt-fall-earth-making-and-myths-joseph-beuys\">Joseph Beuys</a>, Fluxus, Andy Warhol \u2013 and its accompanying experimental music: he was fond of pointing out to interviewers that he was born the year that John Cage composed 4\u201933. At university, he studied the work of modern composers Boulez, Stockhausen and Ligeti; he had a particular interest in the challenging electronic compositions of Iannis Xenakis. The first album to bear Sakamoto\u2019s name, 1975\u2019s Disappointment/Hateruma, was a collaboration with percussionist Toshiyuki Tsuchitori that consisted entirely of free improv. If he was going to have a role in the Japanese pop world at all, it was in the background, using his keyboard skills and interest in the fast-developing world of synthesisers to find employment as a session musician.</p><p>But a pop star was exactly what Sakamoto became, at least for a time. A 1978 session for singer Haruomi Hosono led to the suggestion that they should form a band with drummer Yukihiro Takahashi. Yellow Magic Orchestra went on to become both the biggest band in Japan \u2013 inspiring a degree of paparazzi attention and screaming fervour among fans that Sakamoto seems to have loathed every minute of \u2013 and the first Japanese artists to find more than novelty or cult status in the west.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/02/ryuichi-sakamoto-the-avant-gardist-who-became-a-groundbreaking-pop-star\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/02/ryuichi-sakamoto-the-avant-gardist-who-became-a-groundbreaking-pop-star", "date_published": "2023-04-02 14:04:38+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Social media analyst Emily Hund: \u2018We can never know the truth behind an influencer\u2019s seeming authenticity\u2019", "description": "<p>Today influencers sell ideas about science and medicine as well as products.

But after internships with New York media companies and having witnessed falling circulations and redundancies, she switched to studying one of the catalysts for these changes: social media and the influencers whose YouTube, TikTok and Instagram posts sell ideas, lifestyles and products to their followers. The influencer industry ranges from global stars such as the Kardashians to micro-influencers who post on niche interests. What they have in common is that they work with brands to promote or sell to an audience.

And I had the feeling that finally we are building the future Russian culture, where mutual understanding is important. And then later the Crimea annexation came and I saw people I\u2019d been sitting at the table with shouting: \u201cCrimea is ours! Crimea is ours!\u201d It was like the famous play by [Eug\u00e8ne] Ionesco, <em>Rhinoceros</em>, where people turn into rhinoceroses. It wasn\u2019t possible to talk to them. It was impossible to talk to my brother who lives in Moscow. So we became strangers. There is something like a civilisation gap between us in Russian culture. I can understand why people who don\u2019t read books support this war. But it\u2019s impossible for me to explain why cultured people support this war.</p><p><em>My Russia: War Or Peace?</em> by Mikhail Shishkin, translated by Gesche Ipsen, is published by riverrun (\u00a318.99).
