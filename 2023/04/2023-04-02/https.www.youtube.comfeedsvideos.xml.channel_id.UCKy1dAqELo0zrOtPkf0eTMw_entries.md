Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising is the latest fighting game in the Granblue Fantasy Versus series. This trailer debuted at EVO Japan 2023 showcasing new battle mechanics from the game along with a teaser for the next playable character, Siegfried. Siegfried uses his sword's long-reach attacks to excel at mid-range combat and can consume some of his health to activate Manigance, which gives him a temporary large boost to his attack power. Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC in 2023 with an Open Beta Test scheduled in May 2023 for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.
