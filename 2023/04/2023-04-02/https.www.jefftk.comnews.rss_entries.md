There's also an instrument in this category that could have been
built any time in the last ~500y: talkbox bagpipes.  While the
mouth-blown pipes are probably most familiar, all the mouth is doing is
putting air into a bag.  Bellows pipes replace this with an
arm-operated pump.  This opens up an opportunity to point the drones
into your mouth so you can manipulate the sound of your accompaniment,
turning the drones from a continuous, well, drone, into something
lively and danceable.  Or, at least, it should.  As far as I know no one
has built these, and my attempts to convince my <a href="https://www.thomfordewoodcraft.com/">bagpipe-maker cousin</a> to
work on this haven't been successful.

I was finally successful in convincing my cousin to let me try this,
and it does work!

Probably would be slightly better with a louder drone, or by
amplifying the drone separately so it can be turned up relative to the
chanter.

You'd need to adjust the angles so it could fit in the player's own
mouth, and if you want multiple drones it's mildly tricky to get them
to terminate in the same place, but this seems very doable.  You could
also use your tongue to tap drones on and off.  Possibly this would
even let you switch between dissonant drones, like A and G for an Amix
tune?

If you want to play with this, though, be sure you're using bellows
pipes.  With mouth-blown pipes you'd be risking <a href="https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20160823/wind-instruments-bagpipe-lung">bagpipe
