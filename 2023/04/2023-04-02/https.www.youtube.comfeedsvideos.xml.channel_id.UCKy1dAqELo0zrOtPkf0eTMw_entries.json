This trailer debuted at EVO Japan 2023 showcasing new battle mechanics from the game along with a teaser for the next playable character, Siegfried. Siegfried uses his sword's long-reach attacks to excel at mid-range combat and can consume some of his health to activate Manigance, which gives him a temporary large boost to his attack power. Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC in 2023 with an Open Beta Test scheduled in May 2023 for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.\n\n#GranblueFantasyVersusRising #Siegfried #EVOJapan2023", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LFgQ-mb9CU", "date_published": "2023-04-02 19:45:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Resident Evil 4 Remake: 5 Big Scenes Cut From the Original - Podcast Beyond Clip", "description": "Brian loves Resident Evil 4 so much, he's bought it on practically every available platform.
