Keanu Reeves had a global hit with his action-packed movie The Matrix, and none of his movies since then really lived up to how amazing it was. That is, until John Wick rolled around in 2014. This action-packed shooter with a simple plot became a surprise hit and introduced the world to some awesome gun-fu action.

The movie does raise a few questions though! Like how did they manage to get the producers to get off their back about worldbuilding details and love interests? How does anyone feel safe at the Continental Hotel? Why didn’t Viggo stick around to make sure his men took care of John Wick, and why did John make a deal with Viggo just moments later? Also, why didn’t anyone Google Baba Yaga?

To answer all these questions and more, step inside the pitch meeting that led to John Wick! It’ll be super easy, barely an inconvenience.
