The problem is that, in the metadata, classical music doesn\u2019t just rely on the typical stuff like artist, genre, song title, or album title. There are soloists to consider, and composers, and conductors, and pieces performed by an orchestra and a choir. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/27/23659326/apple-music-classical-available-download-app-store-ios\">Apple Music Classical</a>, based on the Primephonic app <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/30/22648604/apple-acquires-primephonic-classical-music-streaming-service\">that Apple acquired in 2021</a>, addresses the problem with the metadata and has me wondering why more apps aren\u2019t this rich in the stuff.</p>\n<p id=\"kwiXkl\">I didn\u2019t realize how little classical music...</p>\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/2/23659934/apple-music-classical-metadata-is-good\">Continue reading&hellip;</a>\n  </p>", "link": "https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/2/23659934/apple-music-classical-metadata-is-good", "date_published": "2023-04-02 15:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "title": "The Home Assistant SkyConnect is a great excuse to demolish your smart home and start from scratch", "description": "<figure>\n      <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dTAoZz3JVDe7vn5N8EZzjAxeAGE=/0x86:2048x1451/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/72139853/IMG_3627_2.0.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption><em>Adding Zigbee and Thread to Home Assistant has never been easier.</em> | Image: Chris Person</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n\n  \t\t <p>For years, I have been waiting for an excuse to make the transition to Home Assistant.
