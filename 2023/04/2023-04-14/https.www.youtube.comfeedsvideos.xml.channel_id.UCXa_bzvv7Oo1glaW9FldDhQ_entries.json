To that end, then, here, we're going to follow up on our recent recap of Dead Island's story and cover the full story of Dead Island: Riptide.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Sh5oaT6kSg", "date_published": "2023-04-14 13:30:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "Minecraft Legends Review - The Final Verdict", "description": "Minecraft Legends is relatively easy to pick up and play while offering a healthy amount of depth and some fun battles that grow more challenging as you progress. \n\nWhether it's looked back on in the same vein as other action strategy greats is a toss-up, but it offers an endearing gameplay loop and plenty of charm that makes for an enjoyable ride.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4bC1uakHxg", "date_published": "2023-04-14 09:00:36+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
