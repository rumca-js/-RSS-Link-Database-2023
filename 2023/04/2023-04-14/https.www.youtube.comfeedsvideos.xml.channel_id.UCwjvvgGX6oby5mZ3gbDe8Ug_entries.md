In the world's perception, Chinese entering the U.S. illegally seems like a distant past. But data from Panama's immigration department show that in the first two months of 2023, more than 2,000 Chinese have already reached the southern border of the U.S... They are crossing into the US by way of the dangerous Darien Canyon jungle. Both local authorities and private agencies that help migrants say they have never seen so many Chinese ventures north. This number is likely to increase in the future.
