Yesterday, a conservative social media mogul launched a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ultra-right-beer-bud-light" target="_blank">woke-free alternative beer</a>. Now today, a conservative group launched an alert system to notify customers of woke brands. </p><p>The system comes from Consumers' Research, a conservative nonprofit based in D.C. The 'Woke Alert' has consumers enter their phone number to receive text updates on companies that have veered into the woke abyss. So far, it's issued warnings on Bud Light and Jack Daniel’s 2021 “Small Town, Big Pride” campaign.</p><p>Executive Director Will Hild told <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/04/14/conservatives-plot-text-warning-woke-products" target="_blank">Axios</a>, "We are launching Woke Alerts to help consumers make better-informed decisions about where to spend their money. We believe companies should focus on their customers and not woke politicians and progressive activists.”</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>Lefties were quick to mock the woke text system. Of course. Political consultant Anna Bahr told Axios, "I hate to break it to the radical right, but people in this country are a lot more concerned about paying for an eighty-dollar tank of gas than the color of their Budweiser bottle." <br /></p><p>But what if - hear me out - the same people driving up the price of gas are <em>also</em> pushing for rainbow colored beer bottles? And it's all part of the same agenda?</p><p>Rep. Robert Garcia called the service "laughable" and claimed the right is "hell-bent on moving the country backwards". If by backwards he means back to traditional values of morality and Christianity, then I 100% agree. </p><p>I don't know about you, but to me, this system seems like a great idea. It makes it incredibly easy for consumers to avoid buying products in conflict with their values, without spending their own valuable time researching the brands. Perhaps it can help bring about that cultural change we're all hoping for. And quickly. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Watch: Man Who De-Transitioned  Proves Skeptics Wrong With Heartbreaking Video

The pro-trans cult wants to silence them and pretend they don't exist, since they aren't <em>exactly</em> poster children for the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/rady-center-transgender-children" target="_blank">trans movement</a>. They are very real people who have been very badly hurt. </p><p>Seth W. on Twitter is one of those people, and he recently joined Twitter to detail his painful de-transition story. In one tweet, he explained how when he was just 18 years old, a male-to-female trans person told him, “Why would you be a ridiculous gay man when you could be a beautiful woman?” This was just part of the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/journalist-transition-bulimia" target="_blank">pressure</a> he felt when he chose to transition. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cWords that were said to me by an MTF when I was 18 and decided to detransition after starting as a minor: \u201cWhy would you be a ridiculous gay man when you could be a beautiful woman?\u201d I was pressured to keep transing. A decade later, I\u2019m undoing the damage. Tell me it\u2019s not a cult\u201d</div> — Seth W (@Seth W)

</blockquote>

<p>Twitter peeps, of course, didn't believe him and accused him of being a "fake public aggravator" to "manufacture ammunition for anti-trans people". So  to prove that he and his story are real, Seth responded with an absolutely heartbreaking video. </p><p>In the video, you can see and hear for yourself how feminine he appears and sounds. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cThis is as much of the video as it would let me share. Maybe this\u2019ll help put an end to those questioning my detransition story.\u201d</div> — Seth W (@Seth W)

</blockquote>

<p>"If you want to see the truth, this is the truth. I'm an almost thirty-year-old man. This is what I look like, this is what I sound like as an almost thirty-year-old man. This is what happens when you let people transition in adolescence before they’ve had a chance to grow up."</p><p>He explained he transitioned in secret as a minor because people told him if he allowed himself to age, he would become too "masculine" and wouldn't be as feminine of a transwoman. Which is the left's exact argument for putting children on puberty blockers. They claim the effects are reversible, but clearly, they are not. </p><p>I just hope and pray for the day this will all come to an end. And it's incumbent on our side to be there for these people after they escape the cult. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Anheuser-Busch CEO Issues Lackluster Statement Amid Dylan Mulvaney Controversy And Billion Dollar Losses

How exactly is the boycott working, you ask? Anheuser-Busch lost about $6 billion in market cap following the whole Dylan Mulvaney fiasco. Sooo...yeah. That's a lotta dough. </p><p>Today, Anheuser-Busch CEO Brendan Whitworth released a statement about this whole controversy, but declined to issue an apology or specifically mention Mulvaney. Instead, the <a href="https://www.anheuser-busch.com/newsroom/our-responsibility-to-america" target="_blank">statement</a> simply reads: </p><p><em>"As the CEO of a company founded in America’s heartland more than 165 years ago, I am responsible for ensuring every consumer feels proud of the beer we brew.</em></p><p><em>We’re honored to be part of the fabric of this country.

<p>So that sounds like a big ol' nothing burger. But I actually don't think they're lying when they say they didn't intend to divide people. I think the issue of transgenderism is so deeply enmeshed into American culture, <em>especially</em> among the elite and wealthy, it doesn't even cross their minds that some normal folks aren't 100% on board with men claiming to be women. They are very severely detached from the thoughts and opinions of everyday Americans. </p><p>And I doubt this statement will do much, if anything, to quell the brewing boycott of Bud Light. Viable alternatives are already popping up, and Americans seem more than ready to ditch the woke. For good. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## "The taste of penis": Student shares pornographic book his teacher read to the class, along with the horrific excuse

Another school board meeting. Another example of why you should homeschool.  A student didn't think it was appropriate for his teacher to be reading about the taste of penises to a high school class. He addressed the school board to ask how they felt about the taste of penises themselves. Also, the taste of balls.</p><p>Not sure what book it was.

</p>
<p>Is it a simple case of sexual deviancy and needing to be 500 yards away from playgrounds at all times? Or in the teacher's twisted mind, do they think there is educational value in these assignments? In this teacher's case, they found there WAS educational value. Kinda. I'm not quite sure "this is how you kids talk" is a rationale for reading about the taste of penis to high schoolers. </p><p>Context matters. When teens talk about sex and penis and balls to each other, it's in the context of being teens. When a teacher gets off on talking about sex and penis and balls to teens, it's in the context of needing to be 500 yards away from those teens.</p><p>At least the teacher pretended there was educational value, I suppose. In our last school board post, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/school-board-father-eugene-orgegon" target="_blank">that teacher just wanted to know if girls preferred oral or anal</a>. I have to search those words waaaaaay too often to find older posts about school board meetings to reference.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Watch: Media finally reports on IRS coming after your $600 side hustles, but leaves out an important fact

	With tax day next week, the media is FINALLY getting around to reporting on Biden's IRS and their new tax law targeting your side hustles. We've been talking about it since last year. CBS News? They got around to it a few days ago.
</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
		Starting next year, a new IRS rule will require anyone earning over $600 on payment apps, like Venmo, in 2023 to receive a 1099-K form. The old threshold was earning $20,000 over 200 transactions. <a href="https://t.co/TaygGwFBep">pic.twitter.com/TaygGwFBep</a><br />

</blockquote></div><p>
	It used to be you would need to file a 1099-K if you made $20,000 dollars on the side with 200 transactions. The new tax rule is $600 dollars for every ONE transaction. Also, apps like Venmo and PayPal will report those $600 transactions directly to the IRS.
</p><p>
	But CBS News left out a key detail. They said it is a new rule, but where did this new rule come from? It was snuck into Biden's American Rescue Plan. AKA, the stimulus bill. If your elected official voted for it, they voted to lower the threshold to $600. If your elected official is a Democrat, they voted for it.
</p><p><img alt="" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32294934&amp;width=440&amp;quality=80" /></p><p>
	By now you're saying to yourself, <em>"But Brodigan, I'm not a millionaire or a billionaire. I was told that Biden looking to increase taxes on the middle class was misinformation. What the deuce?"</em>
</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

</blockquote></div><p>
	Two things. One, LOL... you said "butt Brodigan." B, I'm not a journalist or an expert. I'm not qualified to answer your question.</p><p>However, there are some things I find interesting that has happened over the past two years. Things that happened all under the guise of protecting the middle class during the, and resulting from, the pandemic. You might find them of interest yourself.
</p><p>
<span></span>- Democrats snuck lowering the threshold to $600 in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. Critics called the bill "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dan-crenshaw-stimulus-bribe" target="_self">bribing us with our own money.</a>" If you opposed this part of the Biden agenda, you were told you didn't want to help taxpayers by sending them stimulus checks.<br />
</p><p>
<img alt="" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32215228&amp;width=440&amp;quality=80" />
</p><p>
	- Funding for 87,000 new IRS employees was snuck into the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/irs-going-for-middle-class" target="_self">Inflation Reduction Act</a>. If you opposed this part of the Democrat agenda you were told you didn't want to reduce inflation.
</p><p>
<img alt="" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32215229&amp;width=440&amp;quality=80" />
</p><p>
	- PayPal, which is willing to work with the Administration, tried sneaking in a penalty that <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/paypal-terms-changed" target="_self">they will take up to $2500 out of your account over what they call "misinformation."</a> Whether what they call "misinformation" is the same as what the Administration defines as "misinformation" is unclear. But I know that you know that I know that you know.
</p><p>
<img alt="" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32215230&amp;width=440&amp;quality=80" />
</p><p>
	- The IRS didn't post an "explainer" about this new rule -- this new rule that was buried in "comprehensive legislation" -- <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11491943/Lawmakers-cry-against-Biden-IRS-reporting-requirements-600-transactions.html" target="_blank">until two weeks after Election Day 2022</a>.</p><p>
<img alt="" src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=32215231&amp;width=960&amp;quality=80" />
</p><p>
	Now the media is reporting on it days before tax day 2023. This new rule that goes into effect on tax day 2024. If taxpayers/voters have a problem with it, there is no longer anything they can do until Election Day 2024, seven months after they get screwed by the IRS.<br /></p><p>In a perfect world, one where there was an institution whose sole job was to hold our elected officials accountable, this new IRS rule would be reported on and exposed PRIOR to it being snuck into a ginormous piece of comprehensive legislation no one was allowed to read.</p><p>Instead, that institution was too busy fluffing the President and the elitists who demanded the law passed to care about anyone else in America.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Waitress gets fired for putting her blood in someone's cocktail, but more shocking is the customer's reaction

Yes, I am quite disturbed. </p><p>A <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/waffle-house-cook-shares-story" target="_blank">waitress</a> in Japan has been fired for mixing her own <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/blood-donation-refused-man" target="_blank">blood</a> into a cocktail. At the customer's request, which makes it <em>slightly</em> better. It'd be even more terrifying if she did it unprompted. </p><p>The restaurant she worked at is called Mondaiji Con Cafe Daku, which loosely translates to "Problem Child Dark Cafe." They tweeted out the news with an apology  and called her actions “absolutely not acceptable.”</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

<p>She apparently put her blood into the cafe's signature drink, which usually uses fruit or syrups. After learning about her actions, the restaurant closed down for a day to replace all of the contaminated glasses and dump any bottles of alcohol that could potentially be tainted. They also called her actions, "job terrorism". </p><p>I must say, if there were ever a place to suspect someone put blood in your drink, this cafe is the one. For starter's, it's literally called "Problem Child Dark Cafe". The waitstaff also dress in gothic attire, donning dark clothing and makeup, which the restaurant itself describes as signals of “mentally unstable” or “problematic” women. </p><p>In case you weren't already aware, drinking other people's blood is a huge medical no-no. Dr. Zento Kitao told a Japanese news site, "Drinking the blood of other people is an extremely dangerous act. Cases of people getting infected from drinking another person’s blood are rare, but major diseases can be transmitted through blood, including HIV, hepatitis C, hepatitis B and syphilis. If there are wounds in the mouth, it is easy to be infected by blood transmissions.”</p><p>So this is all bizarre enough. But I can't get over the fact that a customer <em>requested</em>  this chick's blood be put into his drink. I don't want to think about the motives there. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## US classified docs leaker claims government knew about Buffalo Shooting in advance, and let it happen

The documents included American national security secrets about <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/biden-tanks-escalate" target="_blank">Ukraine</a>, the Middle East, and China, and revealed detailed plans like maps, delivery schedules, and troop strength numbers for the Ukraine Military. So that's not good. </p><p>But the leaker allegedly disclosed even more troubling information to members of an invite-only Discord chat. The leaker said the United States government hides "horrible truths" from the American people and <a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/leaker-of-us-classified-docs-claims-government-knew-about-white-supremacist-buffalo-shooter-in-advance-but-let-it-happen-to-get-more-funding" target="_blank">claimed</a> the government knew about the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/show-notes-buffalo" target="_blank">Buffalo shooter</a> in advance, but allowed it to happen to get more funding. </p><p>Oh. </p><p>The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/04/12/discord-leaked-documents/" target="_blank">Washington Post</a> called this claim "baseless," for whatever that's worth. One of the members of the Discord server told the Washington Post he was impressed by the leaker's ability to predict major events before they hit the news. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cThis line buried in WaPo coverage of Ukraine docs leaker is interesting to say the least:\n\n"OG told his online companions that the government hid horrible truths from the public.

</blockquote>

<p>The claim about the Buffalo shooting is particularly chilling due to the number of red flags missed by federal agencies. Authorities <a href="https://buffalonews.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/authorities-investigating-if-retired-federal-agent-knew-of-buffalo-mass-shooting-plans-in-advance/article_bd408f18-dd39-11ec-be53-df8fdd095d6f.html" target="_blank">reportedly</a> suspected the shooter had informed a retired federal agent of his plans to shoot up the grocery store over Discord prior to the attack.  And he had been investigated just a year beforehand for making a violent threat. Specifically a threat about wanting to carry out a shooting. Which you'd think would raise some alarm bells. But no. </p>
<p>As for the leaker himself, yesterday, 21-year-old Jack Texeira was <a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-massachusetts-national-guardsman-arrested-in-connection-to-pentagon-classified-docs-leak" target="_blank">arrested</a> in connected to the leaks. Texeira is a member of the Massachusetts Air National Guard's intelligence wing and reportedly oversaw the invite-only Discord where the documents were leaked. It wasn't confirmed if he is <em>the</em> leaker, but one official said he may have information relevant to the investigation. </p><p>It will be interesting to see how this all shakes out, and if there's ever an official denial to the claim that the government knew about the Buffalo shooter in advance. At this point, nothing seems too far-fetched. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Watch: Matthew McConaughey exposes condescending” anti-Christian bias in Hollywood

	I wanted to title this <em>Matthew McConaughey: Jesus Is Alright, Alright, Alright with Me.' </em>But it was too dependent on a Zoomer audience knowing who or what the Doobie Brothers were. Google it. If a stoner ever uploads a video of him skateboarding to one of their songs on TikTok, the Doobies will be trendingAF.
</p><p>
	And, yes, I know 
	<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dont-believe-matthew-mcconaughey" target="_blank">McConaughey says dumb things about guns</a>. Dumb things he <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/matthew-mcconaughey-fears-marchforourlives-will-get-hijacked" target="_blank">doesn't always understand while he's saying them</a>. If he runs for president, I'm not voting for him. But I <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mark-wahlberg-first-job" target="_blank">wrote about Mark Wahlberg yesterday</a> being one of the few in Hollywood brave enough to admit he's a practicing believer. It reminded me of this McCoughey clip about when he sees celebrity friends WHO HE HAS PRAYs WITH in public.

<em>"I have had moments where I was on stage receiving an award in front of my peers in Hollywood, and there were people in the crowd that I have prayed with before dinners many times, and when I thanked God, I saw some of those people go to clap, but then notice that, 'bad thing on my resume' and then sit back on their hands. Some people in [Hollywood] ... go to the Left so far ... to the illiberal Left side so far that it's so condescending and patronizing to 50% of the world."</em>

</p><p>What's sad is those commonsense, milquetoast, rational comments will be enough for that "illiberal left" to attack the actor as a Jesus freak and a closet DeSantis supporter, who is literally no better than <em>The Handmaid's Tale</em>. Just for him saying it's silly that people have to fear for their lives instead of outing themselves as Christians. Not even just as "Christians," but as "believers" in general. Unless of course, you're a believer in illiberal politics.
</p><p>
	The funny thing is, Matthew McConaughey isn't afraid to say what his beliefs are and yet has still managed to have a pretty successful career in the entertainment industry. Wahlberg and Chris Pratt too. If more of these closet believers would start to show the same courage, it would actually make a positive difference in the world.</p><p>Now if we can figure out what's going on with <em><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/search/?q=yellowstone" target="_blank">Yellowstone</a></em>. McCounghey has signed on to star in a... spin-off? Taking over as the lead character in the main show? No one seems to know.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

<p>The incident took place in 2019. Jussie claimed he was attacked by Trump supporters in the southside of Chicago--yes, Trump supporters in the southside of Chicago--who called him anti-gay and anti-black slurs, put a noose around his neck, and poured bleach on him. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/eat-crow-celebrities-politicians-who-supported-jussie-smolletts-hoax-hate-crime" target="_blank">Celebrities, politicians, and future presidents and vice presidents of the United States all believed Jussie</a>. After all, why would any decent human being lie about such a heinous crime?</p><p>Turns out Jussie was full of shit. He and the Osundairo brothers -- who Jussie paid by check -- <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jussie-smollett-trial-day-1" target="_blank">rehearsed the hate crime hoax</a>. Why did Jussie do this? Because<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/jussie-smollett-trial-update" target="_blank"> he knew the media would fall for it and uncritically believe him</a>. </p><p>Smollet <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chris-rock-mock-smollett" target="_blank">has become</a> a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/watch-charles-barkley-has-too-much-fun-mocking-jussie-smollett" target="_blank">laughingstock</a> ever since <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/watch-trevor-noahs-silver-lining-of-the-jussie-smollett-story-is-perfect" target="_blank">his hoax</a> was <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dave-chappelle-jussie-smollett" target="_blank">exposed</a>.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>There is no better way to end this story than with the two African brothers paid to pretend to be from MAGA Country discovering for themself, "Self, this MAGA Country is a great place to live."</p><p>Jobs were up. The economy was up, We weren't fighting a war. And most importantly, there wasn't a senile old coot with pudding for brains (<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/hunter-biden-book-dementia" target="_blank">and who critics say has dementia</a>) in the White House. A guy whose handlers need to hide him from the press because they never know when he'll have another "bathroom incident."</p><p>Two African brothers walked into the southside of Chicago and walked out into MAGA Country. THAT, my friends, is the American Dream.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
