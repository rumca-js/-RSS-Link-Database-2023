<ul><li>Manager says keeper has come good ‘against the odds’</li><li>Eddie Nketiah likely to make his return on Sunday</li></ul><p>Mikel Arteta has hailed the form of Aaron Ramsdale, describing his progress at Arsenal as “against the odds” and describing how the club supported the goalkeeper in the face of social media abuse after his arrival.</p><p>Ramsdale has been outstanding in Arsenal’s push for the title, most recently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/09/liverpool-arsenal-premier-league-match-report">saving them a point at Anfield last Sunday</a> with remarkable late stops from Mohamed Salah and Ibrahima Konaté. He has cut a commanding, charismatic figure who shapes much of the team’s buildup play, but Arteta harked back to a less certain spell earlier in the player’s career. Before moving to north London he was relegated from the top flight with Bournemouth and Sheffield United, meaning question marks sprung up externally when Arsenal paid the latter an initial £24m for him in August 2021.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/14/arteta-ramsdale-arsenal-west-ham-preview">Continue reading...</a>

The ruling was met with widespread opposition, with hundreds of protesters pouring out on to Paris's streets to march against the bill.

<p>From the Nazi in Inglourious Basterds to James Bond’s nemesis Blofeld, the Austrian actor has made charismatic bad guys a speciality. Send us your questions – we have ways of making him talk …</p><p>After more than 40 years in the business, Christoph Waltz’s list of awards – including two Academy Awards, two Golden Globes and two Baftas – may be almost as long as his filmography. His first performances, for example as Maksymilian Gierymski in 1997’s Our God’s Brother or Karl August in 1999’s The Bride, probably won’t be familiar to audiences outside of Germany. But then he made the crossover to Hollywood, thanks to Quentin Tarantino casting him as Hans “the Jew Hunter” Landa, a Nazi, in 2009’s Inglourious Basterds, and again as the dentist turned bounty hunter Dr King Schultz in 2012’s Django Unchained.</p><p>Waltz went on to play one of the best known baddies of all time – James Bond’s arch nemesis Ernst Stavro Blofeld – first in Spectre in 2015, and again in 2021 in Daniel Craig’s last stand, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/no-time-to-die">No Time To Die</a>.

<p>The comedian narrates his book about the gruelling treatment of his young son and the love and grief that enveloped his family</p><p>When Henry, the 11-month-old son of Catastrophe actor Rob Delaney and his wife, Leah, began vomiting, his parents weren’t worried – they had two older boys and were accustomed to their kids being ill. But the sickness persisted and, after a series of tests (and several misdiagnoses), Henry was found to have a large tumour near his brain stem. On hearing the news, Delaney recalls: “We sank inside ourselves. The heaviest pain in the world. I felt like I had suddenly quadrupled in weight, and an oily, black whirlpool began to swirl where my heart had been.”</p><p>A Heart That Works – the title is taken from a Juliana Hatfield lyric – is his tender, visceral and improbably funny memoir detailing the gruelling treatment that followed, and Henry’s eventual death, aged two, at home surrounded by his family. As the narrator, who also happens to be a seasoned standup, Delaney knows how to land a one-liner. When his father-in-law says he wishes it were him with the terminal diagnosis rather than Henry, Delaney tells him: “We do too, Richard.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/14/a-heart-that-works-by-rob-delaney-audiobook-review-a-tender-memoir-about-the-death-of-a-child">Continue reading...</a>
