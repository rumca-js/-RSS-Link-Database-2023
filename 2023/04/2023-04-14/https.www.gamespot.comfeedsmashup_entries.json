But games and hardware have also made strides in another key area: audio. Your 4K TV can go a long way toward showcasing these visual improvements, but it won't help the audio shine--unless you also have a high-end soundbar or speaker system on your entertainment stand. To really increase the immersion without spending an exorbitant amount of cash on a speaker system, you can use a dedicated Xbox headset. Many games even recommend wearing a headset for the ideal audio experience. In 2023, there are a bunch of great gaming headsets for Xbox that are worth considering. We've rounded up the best Xbox headsets.</p><p>One great thing about Microsoft's approach to the Xbox Series X|S is that accessories are backward- and forward-compatible. All of your Xbox One gear, including headsets and controllers, are fully compatible with Xbox Series X|S. You may already have a solid headset, but if you're here, chances are you're considering an upgrade. And as mentioned, major manufacturers have made welcome improvements to gaming headset design and feature sets in recent years.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-xbox-headset/1100-6485694/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-xbox-headset/1100-6485694/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-04-14 18:47:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Diablo 4's Dungeons Are Becoming Less Repetitive And Tedious Thanks To Beta Feedback", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/\">Diablo IV's</a> dungeons will be undergoing some big changes in the final version of the game to be less tedious and repetitive, thanks to player feedback.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In a new <a href=\"https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/23938289/diablo-iv-open-beta-retrospective-transforming-feedback-into-change\">blog post</a>, Blizzard dives into all the major changes the team is implementing based on feedback from the game's <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-had-the-biggest-beta-in-diablo-history/1100-6512844/\">record-breaking open beta</a>.
