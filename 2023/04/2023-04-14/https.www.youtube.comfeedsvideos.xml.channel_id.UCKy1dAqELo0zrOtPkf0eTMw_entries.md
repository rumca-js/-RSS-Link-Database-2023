## Super Mario Bros. Movie Smashes Video Game Adaptation Box-Office Record - IGN The Fix: Entertainment

The highest-grossing movie of 2023 so far is The Super Mario Bros. movie. As for video game adaptations, Mario is the highest grossing film, ever - surpassing Warcraft and out-sleuthing Detective Pikachu. Universal is definitely pulling in the dough with this one, as the Mario movie is the studio’s 10th biggest animated movie worldwide. This film might answer the question for some fans: Who’s the better, more profitable video game mascot between Sonic and Mario? With the #Mariomovie hitting number one at the domestic box office for highest grossing video game adaptation of all time, Sonic is surprisingly left in the dust. The film currently stands at number 2 in the animated film category, somehow knocking Demon Slayer: Mugen Train down a peg. Gru and his minions, however, are well ahead of Mario with Minions: The Rise of Gru at $942.5 million. There’s apparently an age requirement to play James Bond, new details on when to expect The Flash movie on streaming, plus a lot more on today’s fix with Akeem Lawanson.

## The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Final Trailer Map Comparison

Nintendo just released their final trailer for Tears of the Kingdom and gave us a brand new look at the sequel's version of Hyrule. But how different is the map from Breath of the Wild? We jumped back in to our old saves to find out.

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom appears to feature new dungeons (or at least dungeon-like areas) in addition to the new Sky Islands. New ways to traverse the old map and interact with the materials should breathe new life into TotK, and hopefully will keep it from feeling too much like BotW. Between Hyrule Castle, Hateno Village, and even the Thyphlo Ruins, it’s clear that plenty has changed between these two games.

April 15, 2023, marks the 40th anniversary of the original Evil Dead film. To celebrate that occasion, feast your eyes on this exclusive gross-out clip from Evil Dead Rise, the latest entry in the iconic horror franchise.

New Line Cinema and Renaissance Pictures present Evil Dead Rise, from writer/director Lee Cronin (The Hole in the Ground). The movie stars Lily Sullivan (I Met a Girl, Barkskins), Alyssa Sutherland (The Mist, Vikings), Morgan Davies (Storm Boy, The End), Gabrielle Echols (Reminiscence) and introducing Nell Fisher (Northspur).

Moving the action out of the woods and into the city, Evil Dead Rise tells a twisted tale of two estranged sisters, played by Sutherland and Sullivan, whose reunion is cut short by the rise of flesh-possessing demons, thrusting them into a primal battle for survival as they face the most nightmarish version of family imaginable.

“Evil Dead Rise” is produced by Rob Tapert (Ash vs Evil Dead, Don’t Breathe) and executive produced by series creator and horror icon Sam Raimi and cult legend and “Ash” himself, Bruce Campbell, along with John Keville, Macdara Kelleher, Richard Brener, Dave Neustadter, Romel Adam and Victoria Palmieri. Cronin is joined behind the camera by director of photography Dave Garbett (Z for Zachariah, Underworld: Rise of the Lycans), production designer Nick Bassett (Guns Akimbo, Sweet Tooth), editor Bryan Shaw (Ash vs Evil Dead, Spartacus) and costume designer Sarah Voon (Chasing Great, Inside), with a score by Stephen McKeon (The Hole in the Ground, Primeval).

A New Line Cinema / Renaissance Pictures presentation of a Pacific Renaissance and Wild Atlantic Pictures production, Evil Dead Rise will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures and is set to open in theaters in North America on April 21, 2023, and internationally beginning 19 April 2023.

Minecraft Legends Reviewed by Justin Koreis on Xbox Series X, also available on Xbox One, PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch.

This Minecraft spin-off is an engaging strategy game that does a great job streamlining a notoriously complex genre without sacrificing the ever-important element of choice and consequence. The difficulty curve does have the potential to make the late game frustrating, but stellar co-op and PVP play still make this RTS very worthwhile.
