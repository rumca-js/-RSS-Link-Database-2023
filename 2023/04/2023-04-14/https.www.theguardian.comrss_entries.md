<p>St George’s Park visit shows lengths officials go to in pursuit of right decisions and how they deal with things going wrong</p><p>It is just past midday on Wednesday and after Mr Blue Sky plays over a montage of talking points from a busy Easter weekend of matches in the Terry Venables Room at St George’s Park, 19 referees and 30 assistant referees are plugged into the words of Kevin Friend, the select group two Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) manager. An hour earlier the referees were hurtling up and down the grass, honing their acceleration and sprint techniques in the first session of the two-day training camp at the Football Association’s sprawling national hub. “There is a lot to play for in the coming weeks,” Friend says, “and they are also really big games for us.”</p><p>This is a sacred place – Gareth Southgate is on site reviewing England’s latest displays – and 24 hours behind the scenes with Championship referees, some of whom have officiated in the top flight, is insightful and eye-opening. A referee makes on average about 300 decisions a game, an assistant about 200. Across an English Football League season referees make more than 530,000 decisions. Naturally, some are scrutinised more than others. “A referee is pretty much like a goalkeeper,” says Friend, a former Premier League referee. “If a goalkeeper makes a mistake, they usually concede a goal; if a referee makes a mistake, it’s a penalty or something like that, [something] everyone is talking about. If we make a decision that is perceived wrong, that hurts a lot.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/14/pgmol-referee-training-camp-behind-the-scenes">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Publishing internal documents in wartime will always be controversial. But the US secrecy world is not fit for purpose either</p><p>There must always be a place for necessary whistleblowing from inside governments. This newspaper will always stand, responsibly, for that principle. Yet leaks are also serious matters, which challenge a state. In a particularly serious case, or at a particularly serious time, such as during a war, a leak can help an enemy, dismay allies, weaken morale and, at least potentially, change the military balance and put lives at risk.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pentagon-leaks" title="">The leak</a> of highly classified US intelligence documents covering plans to aid Ukraine’s war against Russia is unquestionably grave, both in its content and context. In Ukraine, Nato is in the midst of by far its most serious conflict for a generation. The inherent seriousness of the leaks is enhanced by other factors, including the details and numbers they contained, the breadth of the secrets’ online distribution, including to potential enemies, the length of time they were accessible, and the likelihood that the material becomes part of a disinformation campaign.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/14/the-guardian-view-on-the-pentagon-leaks-this-system-puts-lives-at-risk">Continue reading...</a>

## The Guardian view on China and Europe: Macron’s careless words were costly | Editorial

<p>Despite the French president’s post-visit remarks, there is growing concern about Beijing and keenness to act in unity</p><p>Four years ago, Emmanuel Macron remarked that the era of European naivety on China was over. As Andrew Small establishes in his book <a href="https://www.hurstpublishers.com/book/the-rupture/" title="">The Rupture</a>, the shift was not born primarily of US pressure to pick sides – though that was unquestionably felt – but of Europe’s own dealings with Beijing. Views have hardened further thanks to China’s increasing forcefulness in foreign policy, its handling of Covid and its support for Russia over Ukraine. Last month, the EU Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/speech_23_2063" title="">urged</a> a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c89c9472-51d6-42fc-a305-22dba159cca2" title="">“de-risking”</a> of relations with China. The French president’s insistence on including her in his trip to Beijing last week sent a welcome message of unity.</p><p>But it was his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/10/emmanuel-macron-sparks-anger-europe-vassal-us-china-clash" title="">remarks</a> to journalists on the way home that seized attention. Observing – in the context of Taiwan – that Europe should not be a “vassal” to the US or get caught up in crises that “are not our own” undermined support for a democracy and sparked anger across European capitals. The German parliamentarian Norbert Röttgen <a href="https://twitter.com/n_roettgen/status/1645416956185530369" title="">attacked</a> “a PR coup for Xi [Jinping] and a foreign policy disaster for Europe”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/14/the-guardian-view-on-china-and-europe-macrons-careless-words-were-costly">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ronnie O’Sullivan begins his quest for an eighth world title on Saturday hoping age proves no barrier to success</p><p>We have known for quite some time that Ronnie O’Sullivan is not your typical snooker player.

<p>Inflation and the climate crisis are hitting developing economies hardest. Trade is the key to helping them</p><ul><li>Mia Mottley is prime minister of Barbados. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala is director-general of the World Trade Organization</li></ul><p>The Covid-19 pandemic derailed economies everywhere, and in most developing countries incomes remain well below pre-pandemic levels.<strong> </strong>Inflation, made worse by the war in Ukraine, is particularly painful for low-income and vulnerable countries, where essentials like food and energy dominate household budgets. Higher interest rates are exacerbating debt distress across much of the developing world, squeezing public and private investment and paring back growth. To compound this, the climate crisis is hitting the very countries that contribute least to the problem, and which have the most limited means to cope.</p><p>Already, we are seeing the reversal of hard-won development gains. The World Bank estimates that the pandemic and the war in Ukraine have pushed <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/pandemic-prices-and-poverty">up to 95 million more people</a> into extreme poverty.

## Dubravka Ugrešić: a droll genius with an unwavering devotion to literature

<p>The writer, who died last month, was a fiercely funny social commentator whose prose always radiated a playful profundity</p><p>I discovered that Dubravka Ugrešić had died last month, aged 73, in that strange, uniquely modern way one does: by noticing a sudden proliferation of quotes from her works on Twitter. For a moment I could suspend the sadness and scroll through her sharp-witted wisdom. But there was a darker irony to the scene – one that Ugrešić, a writer all too attuned to the impoverishment of literature in the name of consumption, would have found quite amusing. Visit her website and the text that greets you reads: “Who knows, maybe one day there will no longer be Literature. Instead … there will be quotes, fragments of texts, which prove that there used to be complete texts once.” In other words, literature as content, content as literature. Dubravka the playful, Dubravka the prophetic.</p><p>Ugrešić was born in 1949 in Kutina in the former Yugoslavia, to a Bulgarian mother and Croatian father, but spent the majority of her working life in exile in Amsterdam. When war took hold of Yugoslavia in the early 90s, Ugrešić spoke out against the creeping nationalism of newly independent Croatia – for which she was shunned by the literary establishment (“whatever that word means,” I can hear her mutter). Booksellers stopped displaying her books and critics boycotted her works. The media even accused her of being a witch. Well versed in the intimate link between the history of sexism and tired literary tropes, Ugrešić would later respond to this charge with characteristic class: “I accepted it as an honourable name,” she told an interviewer in 1999. “I decided to take my broom and fly away.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/14/dubravka-ugresic-a-droll-genius-with-an-unwavering-devotion-to-literature">Continue reading...</a>

In principle, making a semifreddo is very simple: it’s composed of a cooked-out, sweetened, rich egg yolk base and lightly whipped cream that are folded together and, once frozen, equal semifreddo (or, for a version of a mousse, refrigerated). Make this as a loaf, and slice or scoop straight from the container.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/apr/14/rum-and-raisin-semifreddo-recipe-ravneet-gill">Continue reading...</a>

## Frank Auerbach: Twenty Self-Portraits review – savage, compassionate and pineapple-like

<p><strong>Hazlitt Holland-Hibbert, London<br /></strong>Now in his 90s, the great German-British painter is finally putting his own face up for scrutiny – with wondrously strange results</p><p>Old age is relative. When Rembrandt painted his Self-Portrait at the Age of 63, showing his pummelled, bankrupted, bereaved face, he looked ancient. He died that year. All his self-portraits as an “old man” were done in his 50s and early 60s. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/frank-auerbach">Frank Auerbach</a>, by contrast, will be 92 this month. He is marking the moment with an extraordinary series of self-portraits that examine his face with such relentless honesty, he’s like a 21st-century Rembrandt.</p><p>Auerbach has said that he never used to find his own head visually interesting – but “now that I’ve got bags under my eyes, things are sagging and so on, there’s more material to work with”. In these 20 paintings and drawings – many finished in the early months of this year – he makes the most of that saggy material. Over a soft-shaded pencil drawing of his walnut-like phiz, jagged lines are added like time’s graffiti. In another, the flesh is almost invisible under a network of disembodied wrinkles. One painting suggests the shadowy features of a skull, yet from its depths a fire-red eye blazes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/14/frank-auerbach-twenty-self-portraits-review-hazlitt-holland-hibbert-london">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Twenty minutes in the changing room is all that stands between you and your forever denims</p><p>Why is it so tricky to shop for jeans? You walk into a store where 2,458 almost-identical slivers of blue denim are stacked in forbiddingly neat piles in front of you. You approach this wall of denim and a sales assistant immediately barks CAN I HELP YOU? in a tone of voice you recognise as code for, “I spent all morning lining those up, madam, and if you so much as lay a finger on my masterpiece I will put a curse on your unborn children.”</p><p>So, of course, being British you say “Oh no, I’m fine, thank you so much” and peer at the shelves trying to deduce from the obtuse names of the jeans – “Baxter”, say, or “Houston” – which are going to magically make you look like Jane Birkin in St Tropez or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2016/jun/24/kate-mosss-glastonbury-dress-code" title="">Kate Moss at Glastonbury</a>.<br /><br />The labels on jeans are a bit like labels on wine bottles, in that they are dense with geeky vocabulary that means absolutely nothing to the overwhelming majority of people buying them. You just want to know which jeans will make your bum look nice/which bottle of red will not taste of vinegar or leave you feeling poisoned for two days. When I’m looking at a pair of jeans, the weight in ounces of the fabric per yard is about as helpful as the topographical details of the vineyard when I’m choosing a bottle wine.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/apr/14/your-perfect-jeans-do-exist-you-just-need-to-know-what-to-look-for">Continue reading...</a>

<p>At the start of the 2010s, the Londoner released two tracks that would change the sound of the next decade. Then he vanished. This weekend, he rewards faithful fans with his first ever show</p><p>The Coachella lineup sparks discourse every year without fail: it can tell you who might have an album dropping soon or who’s less famous than they may have initially seemed, the sounds that will dominate pop over the coming year and the legacy acts set to re-form. This year, <a href="https://coachella.com/">the poster</a> featured a jarring but not unwelcome surprise: on the second line of the Friday lineup, ahead of upstart rappers GloRilla and Latto, below near-mythical figures Frank Ocean and Björk, was Jai Paul – the London producer who sent ripples through the pop landscape with two singles in the early 2010s, before basically disappearing altogether.</p><p>Billing on a festival poster might seem inconsequential, but it can mean the world to an artist – just ask Lana Del Rey, who <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/lana-del-rey-glastonbury-lineup-b2294450.html">threatened to pull out of Glastonbury</a> this year after not appearing high enough on the lineup. It symbolises a career milestone that some artists spend their entire lives trying to reach. Which is why it’s unheard of for an artist such as Paul, who has never even played a live show, to achieve that status on his first go. Of course, it’s not unwarranted: Paul’s music remains totally singular and goodwill towards him is strong.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/14/jai-paul-coachella-festival">Continue reading...</a>

<p>ITV’s Hunt for Raoul Moat follows the 2010 search for fugitive killer, but some in Northumberland say it is dredging up bad memories</p><p>“It was all quite surreal,” said Helen Lee recalling the week in which a quiet market town, her home, became ground zero for one of the biggest manhunts in British history. “There were so many reporters … police with machine guns. We were told if we wanted to go home that it was in our own hands.”</p><p>“Later we had people coming here asking ‘do you know where Raoul Moat shot himself?’,” she added. “People came with flowers and all sorts, it was just appalling. One lady came on the bus with her two children to show them where it happened … it was sick.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/14/hunt-for-raoul-moat-itv-drama-rothbury-northumberland">Continue reading...</a>

Until, that is, he came across five spandex-wearing masked superheroes battling outlandish rubber monsters – and decided to adapt Japanese show, Super Sentai, for US TV, as Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.</p><p>When its pilot made it to air in 1993, viewers were treated to an evil space witch escaping moon imprisonment to battle an android-assisted character who was simultaneously a wizard and a big head in a jar. There were giant mech robots known as Zords, plus the martial arts and acrobatic skills of their operators – “five teenagers with attitude”. Their grandiose hope? To save the Earth from the forces of evil – and hopefully keep the actors playing them away from the breadline.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/14/power-rangers-reunion-mighty-morphin-netflix">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Genuine contenders run right down to 11th place and Preston are a rare form team outside top three as they head to Millwall </p><p>Different protagonists but the same breathless scramble. Gary Rowett struck a chord when, asked whether the Championship’s essence had changed in almost a decade of guiding some of its contenders towards the run-in, he alighted on the perfect descriptor. “It’s pretty much the same,” the Millwall manager began. “You get a lot of different nationalities, styles, different ways people run their clubs. But ultimately ‘carnage’ is probably the one consistent word I would use.”</p><p>Rowett has taken Millwall through 41 games of what, for most behind the runaway leaders Burnley, has been the standard rollercoaster ride. They are fifth and holding on in a chase for top-six spots that have come to resemble the hottest of potatoes. The Lions have won only once in their past five games; incredibly that goes for every side between fourth and 13th, except one.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/14/championship-playoff-race-millwall-preston">Continue reading...</a>

<p>You can see about 700 gambling ads in every Premier League game.  Each one is a potential hook into a lifetime of addiction</p><p>In the depths of my gambling addiction, I hit a moment when I vowed to never gamble again and closed all my betting accounts. But then as I watched Match of the Day that evening, a new company was advertised in the hoardings, and I was straight back online placing a bet.</p><p>In fact, it was the wall-to-wall advertising around football that first drew me in at 16. It started at the bookies, but after signing up with the big brands online, I was soon sent daily “free spin” offers for the even more addictive online slots and casino games. When I started really losing, I was made a ”VIP customer” where – still on minimum wage – I was sent free Premier League tickets and other gifts. Over the next 12 years I lost every penny I could scrape together. But the money wasn’t even the biggest problem. Gambling turned a happy, bright and motivated young person into a broken, depressed and hopeless 28-year-old wreck.

I’ve always regarded Invisibilia, which launched back in 2015, as one of podcasting’s mainstays: one of, say, 10 shows that anyone who has even a passing interest in podcasts has probably heard of. It was clever in an unshowy way but also compulsively moreish, with great sound design and likable hosts.

The stone will sit in the centrepiece of the crown worn by Camilla, the Queen Consort, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/feb/14/camilla-wear-queen-mary-crown-coronation">replacing the Koh-i-noor</a>, the better known but controversial jewel that was plundered from India.</p><p>Unlike the Koh-i-noor, the replacement diamond is not part of the state-owned crown jewels.

They usually sit in what is probably the most valuable brooch in the world; one that, with its royal connections, could be worth well over £180m.

<p>Inland fish restaurants are peculiar places; the older I get, the more I question why they exist at all</p><p>The area around Birmingham New Street on Saturday night gave me a taste of how weekend nightlife in Britain used to be, before the heart fell out of so many of our towns and cities. Once upon a time, almost everywhere looked like this from about 7pm on Saturdays; sort of Hogarthian, but with a flavour of an episode of <a href="https://screenrant.com/last-of-us-episode-1-plane-crash-scene/">The Last of Us</a> in which a full-scale riot, peppered by zombies, is crashed into by a flaming 747. Anyway, it’s safe to say that, on this particular evening, Birmingham’s revellers had started their sessions early. The queues outside <a href="https://thebotanist.uk.com/locations/birmingham">The Botanist</a> and <a href="https://www.revoluciondecuba.com/bar/birmingham/">Revoloción de Cuba</a> were already buoyant with hens in sashes and stags planning strategic <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=chunder">chunders</a>, while outside McDonald’s, one young woman wearily asked her friends: “Can’t we just, like, stop drinking, get a Maccy’s and go home?” A peal of cackles was their reply.</p><p><a href="https://www.the-oyster-club.co.uk/">The Oyster Club</a>, on the other hand, which sits at the top of Temple Street, is altogether classier. It’s a posh seafood restaurant with a marble counter where you can eat Loch Ryan native oysters at £28 for six and omelette Arnold Bennett at £21.50. It’s a special-occasion place, with some lovely birthdays and anniversaries taking place on the night we went, but even they couldn’t drown out the noise from the “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Kum8OUTuk">considerably richer than yous</a>” sitting to both my right and left, and who were forensically detailing their properties, post-tax profits and jetsetting adventures at a volume so loud, it blew the sorrel off my rhubarb-dressed oysters.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/apr/14/the-oyster-club-birmingham-restaurant-review-grace-dent">Continue reading...</a>

## Bold, brash and easy to grow – the dahlia’s Instagram reign is never over

<p>Get planting now for a summer and autumn garden packed with these colourful blooms</p><p>There’s one flower whose relevance in the zeitgeist fascinates me beyond all others: the dahlia. Bold, brash, blooms as big as your head, they can command devotion bordering on obsession among some flower-growers, especially – and intriguingly – among the relatively inexperienced gardener. This is, I think, because they can be straightforward to grow, and look good on Instagram.</p><p>I suspect in some gardens dahlias have never been out of fashion. However, they’ve certainly enjoyed a prolonged moment over the past decade. A couple of summers ago, though, I chaired a panel with experts Sarah Raven and Arthur Parkinson, who admitted to being a bit fed up with the cream-coloured queen of Pinterest, dahlia “<a href="https://www.crocus.co.uk/plants/_/dahlia-caf-au-lait/classid.2000015160/" title="">Café au Lait</a>”. This, combined with their absence during the one-off September <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/chelseaflowershow" title="">Chelsea flower show</a> a few months later, had me convinced the dahlia’s millennial reign was over. Nevertheless, they persevere on Instagram – and life is too short to grow flowers according to trends.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/14/dahlias-grow-the-insta-favourite-thats-never-out-of-fashion">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Experts share their dos and don’ts to avoid embarrassing yourself on social media</p><p>Social media is bad. And awkward. And one of the easiest places to make an idiot of yourself. We all know it, and we all know why, but it exists and most people are on it one way or another because there’s something deeply and irreparably wrong with us.</p><p>So, given that millions of us are in this position, how can we avoid some of the endless pitfalls that come with presenting ourselves on social media? And how do we avoid embarrassment or falling out with friends, partners or employers? With the caveat that each generation uses social media differently (here’s to you over-50s, and your love of ending a message with an ellipsis, and to Gen Z’s obsession with the term “low-key”), here are some general dos and don’ts for online behaviour, corroborated by social media and etiquette experts.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/14/how-to-behave-online-expert-guide-avoid-making-an-ass-of-yourself-on-social-media">Continue reading...</a>

There are tavernas and bars in the pretty village, and various accommodation options. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/porto_trizonia/?hl=en">Porto Trizonia Taverna</a> is our favourite.

There was time for Alastair Cook to purr his old mate through the covers for four before Anderson tethered his man, Cook exiting stage left for an lbw that technology may not have smiled at. All the cogs in the machinery seemed in good working order for the Ashes.<br /><br />Earlier, <strong>Lancashire</strong> had opted to bat after winning the toss, but had to bank on a maiden fifty from their young wicketkeeper George Bell to inch their innings towards respectability. Sam Cook frisked five more wickets to the pleasure of the <strong>Essex</strong> CEO, John Stephenson, who said: “There’s no way England can ignore [him].” Simon Harmer fielded in a snood pulled up to his nose.<br /><br />At The Oval, the 2022 champions, <strong>Surrey</strong>, were visited by likely pretenders <strong>Hampshire</strong>, who rescued their innings from the doldrums of 114 for six on a pitch where the ball nipped about like a rogue pea on a plate. Ben Brown, who fell five runs short of his hundred, and Keith Barker put on 96 for the seventh wicket, grinding runs and gathering a bonus point. Rory Burns and Dom Sibley saw Surrey through till stumps.<br /><br />A career-best seven for 84 for Lewis Gregory, on a pitch the colour of a lime jelly, kept <strong>Somerset</strong> in contention at Trent Bridge. Haseeb Hameed and Ben Duckett– one careful and slow-flowering, sitting 28 balls on 0, the other attacking and lucky, reaching fifty with a reverse-swept six off Jack Leach – cantered to an opening partnership of 125 for <strong>Nottinghamshire</strong>.<br /><br />Duckett was lbw to Craig Overton, who had earlier walked off the field after three overs, striking fear into the hearts of Somerset supporters. But it was Hameed’s wicket which precipitated a collapse of five for 22. Stuart Broad opened the bowling for Notts, and immediately had Tom Lammonby dropped behind the stumps.<br /><br /><strong>Middlesex’s</strong> top order continued its impression of a dropped trifle, as <strong>Northamptonshire’s</strong> Ben Sanderson (three for 19) tucked in. Ryan Higgins was, once more, left to pick up the pieces, backed up by John Simpson – their only two players to make double figures.<br /><br /><strong>Durham’s</strong> batters yet again started the round in fine fettle, this time against <strong>Worcestershire</strong>. David Bedingham, who at the start of the season expressed a wish to play for South Africa, made a glorious century.</p><p>DIVISION ONE</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/apr/14/surrey-v-hampshire-warwickshire-v-kent-and-more-county-cricket-live">Continue reading...</a>

The format sees adults with a range of body types disrobing in front of an audience of 14- to 16-year-olds. It’s overseen by the bombastic, boundary-pushing Anna Richardson and set in a school. It’s this latter fact that appears to have inspired the most pearl-clutching, with some even suggesting the show “<a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/channel-4-defends-educational-nudity-of-naked-education-6dlrgrnkm">promotes paedophilia</a>”.</p><p>British culture has a messed-up relationship with nudity.

<p>What better final bonding experience than a video game about a prison break before heading off to uni?</p><p>My son Charlie leaves home in a few weeks. He will be 3,000 miles away. My heart is breaking. I decide we need one more formative games playing experience. Something we can bond over, that will maybe teach him a few life lessons along the way.</p><p>A Way Out (PS4, Windows, Xbox One) is a two-player co-op game that has you trying to escape from a prison.

I fuck people up.” Understandably, I’m wondering whether this will be the light, fun bonding experience I’d hoped for.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/apr/14/my-son-is-moving-out-but-we-had-time-to-play-one-last-game">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Prime minister told tackling target difficult if more NHS strikes ahead</p><p>The <strong>RCN</strong> ballot of members on the NHS pay deal closed at 9am. The result should be announced this afternoon, the union says. A spokesperson said:</p><p>Voting closed at 9am and we have no verified result until later today. An announcement of the final result will take place during the day and we will set out the next steps.</p><p>Sources close to the union said the vote is so close that it has been forced to make contingency plans for a no vote. Those plans would mean the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs">NHS</a> in England would be hit by another wave of nursing strikes, starting within weeks and going on for what union officials say would be a prolonged period of time.</p><p>Such a result could leave patients having to deal with strikes by nurses and junior doctors at the same time, leading to more delayed treatments and missed appointments. It would also deal a heavy blow to the government, which had hoped a deal with nurses would pave the way for a series of settlements and bring an end to the winter’s wave of industrial action.</p><p>NHS bosses are particularly concerned about the RCN, whose members are expected to vote against by a “narrow” margin, with some predicting a 55-45 split. Unison members, who include ambulance workers and other frontline staff, are considered more likely to accept.</p><p>Three sources with knowledge of the process said it was becoming increasingly apparent that RCN members were likely to vote against the deal. Although voting will continue until 9am tomorrow, one NHS source said: “It’s not looking good”.</p><p>Another set of strikes would mean that it would become very very difficult, perhaps almost impossible, for the health service, hospitals, to meet targets that they set this year for reducing waiting lists.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/apr/14/rishi-sunak-rcn-nurses-pay-deal-suella-braverman-small-boats-uk-politics-live">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Dynamite chemistry, effortlessly zingy dialogue and whip-smart gags delivered at breakneck pace – this glorious comedy-drama gets the utterly fitting send-off it deserves</p><p>Tits up! Amy Sherman-Palladino’s Emmy-winning comedy-drama, The Marvelous Mrs Maisel, is taking a final bow with this fifth season. Some argue that along the way, the show’s quality has dipped in parts and run for one season too many – but a woman’s journey from being a doting 1950s housewife to a divorced standup comedian was never going to be swift.</p><p>After opening with a surprise flash-forward scene (a new one is cleverly used at the start of each episode to help tell the whole story), the series returns to the usual timeline and picks things up the morning after Midge (Rachel Brosnahan) got caught out in the blizzard that ended the previous season. Having said no to the Tony Bennett gig because of her new “no opening acts!” manifesto, she is in bed, delirious with hypothermia, clinging to a frostbitten toe and full of regret. “Six months!” declares her agent Susie (Alex Borstein). That is, she is only expecting the performer to last another six months before she loses the will to carry on with comedy altogether. So it’s back to the clubs for Midge and her 10 toes (phew!), where Susie pounces on a TV producer to secure her gal a job in a joke writing room for a primetime chat show.</p><p>The Marvelous Mrs Maisel is on Prime Video.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/14/the-marvelous-mrs-maisel-season-five-review-this-exquisite-show-gets-the-finest-possible-farewell">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There’s a ton of plot packed into this standalone movie derived from the TV series, but the deluge of detail gets steadily more absorbing</p><p>Here is a standalone feature film and final capstone in Netflix’s British-made TV series The Last Kingdom, an epic in every sense of the word that’s based on novels by Bernard Cornwell and unfolds in the 10th century, just before the Norman invasion. Even if you’ve never seen a single episode from any of the show’s previous five seasons of dramatised yet highly researched British history, you’ll probably quite like to go back and start watching the whole saga from the beginning because it gets more gripping the more you surrender to it. This is largely down to the thoughtful way it tries to present a society composed of pagan Danes and Christian Saxons – and folks who are a bit of both – trying with some difficulty to all get along.</p><p>The main dude is one such mixed-heritage chap named Uhtred (Alexander Dreymon), who apparently was born a Saxon but raised by Vikings and believes in the Norse gods. A fearsome warrior wielding a sword with a chunk of amber on the hilt, and a mane of tangled hair shaved at the sides so he looks like a new age traveller from the 1990s, Uhtred is the leader of a community in Northumbria, eschewing the title king. His alliance with the royal family of Wessex to the south is tested when newly crowned King Aethelstan (Harry Gilby) comes to power and is persuaded by his closest adviser Ingilmundr (Laurie Davidson) (a fanatical convert to Christianity) to use this moment to seize control of all Britain’s kingdoms, from the Shetland and Orkney islands to Wessex. There are, as the title might imply, eight kings in all, but the wife of a friend of Uhtred’s with a history of making prophecies foretells that seven of them will die.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/14/the-last-kingdom-seven-kings-must-die-review-gripping-spin-off-from-netflix-show">Continue reading...</a>

The score was Ding 2 Nepomniachtchi 2 before Friday’s rest day.</p><p>Ding’s troubles began in game one, after Nepomniachtchi chose a rare variant of the DERLD (Delayed Exchange Ruy Lopez Deferred), known as the Deadly Derld when it was popular in London tournaments in the 1970s. His selection of 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 Bb5 a6 4 Ba4 Nf6 5 0-0 Be7 6 Bxc6 dxc6 7 Re1 even causing Magnus Carlsen to ask his aides whether that move had been considered during the prep for his 2016 match against Sergey Karjakin (yes, it had).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/apr/14/ding-liren-strikes-back-hard-after-poor-start-against-ian-nepomniachtchi">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Free Dirt)<br /></strong>Multi-instrumentalist Amelia Baker conjures realms of poetic sound on a lush, complex, sometimes overwhelming album <br /></p><p>American roots music thrives on independent labels such as Washington DC’s Free Dirt, home to the likes of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/sep/27/jake-blount-on-his-afrofuturist-folk-climate-eulogy-what-would-music-sound-like-when-were-dead">Jake Blount</a> and Anna &amp; Elizabeth: artists who use traditional archives and instruments to tell alternative stories about our present and future. But it is Cinder Well, AKA multi-instrumentalist Amelia Baker, who could be the label’s breakout star.</p><p>Her earlier work included earthy arrangements of Appalachian songs and Roud ballads, but on <a href="https://cinderwell.bandcamp.com/album/cadence">Cadence</a> she is more interested in mythological expanses of poetry and sound than stormier swells of texture and drone. The album explores her love for the sea, as befits an artist who lives between her Pacific-side US birthplace and her adopted home town in coastal County Clare. She sings about it compellingly, in a strangely soft, mid-range rasp, like a peculiar cousin of Laura Veirs.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/14/cinder-well-cadence-review-free-dirt">Continue reading...</a>

## Kathleen Hanna’s feminist party band Le Tigre reunite: ‘It’s depressing our lyrics are still relevant 20 years later’

<p>They got back together for a one-off show on Hanna’s doorstep. Then they realised they had unfinished business: to affirm their place in the punk canon and get warring feminists offline and revelling together</p><p>Most bands wring their hands over whether to reunite or not, but for Le Tigre it was easy. The impetus was a festival in Pasadena, Los Angeles, in 2022. “It was three miles from my house,” says frontwoman <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jul/02/kathleen-hanna-im-a-punk-rock-stripper-with-sexual-abuse-counsellor-training">Kathleen Hanna</a>, laughing. “I was like: ‘I want to do this because I can cruise down the hill and go to the festival and all my friends can come.’” Then they concluded that the rehearsals for the festival – done over video call, and in LA and New York where bandmates Johanna Fateman and JD Samson live – shouldn’t be wasted. They announced a full tour, their first since 2005, which hits the UK in June.</p><p>Returning now, with Hanna free from the Lyme disease that severely limited her life for more than eight years, feels cathartic. “Getting back together to perform these songs is a bit of resolution for us artistically,” says Fateman. “We were either under too much pressure from promoting an album or we didn’t totally get to realise our vision, so we’re able to scale it up almost 20 years later, which is a crazy opportunity – who wouldn’t take that?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/14/kathleen-hannas-feminist-party-band-le-tigre-reunite-its-depressing-our-lyrics-are-still-relevant-20-years-later">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A stirring call to make justice and equity a reality by applying the ideas of liberal philosopher John Rawls</p><p>If members of the shadow frontbench seek inspiration on how to differentiate their future administration from the mendacious nonentities who have run the country for the past 13 years, they could do worse than read this book. Free and Equal is a stirring call by an LSE philosopher and economist for egalitarian liberalism based on the ideas of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2020/dec/20/john-rawls-can-liberalisms-great-philosopher-come-to-the-wests-rescue-again" title="">John Rawls</a>. The late Harvard professor wrote a book 50 years ago that saw him feted as a political thinker of the calibre of Plato, Hobbes and Mill, but, as far as I can tell, he had precisely zero impact on the real world. Maybe now his time has come.</p><p>In A Theory of Justice, Rawls invited us to imagine what a just society would look like by means of an elegant thought experiment. Suppose, Rawls suggested, that we are all behind what he calls a “veil of ignorance”, with knowledge of our talents, income and wealth, as well as our core values, temporarily erased. In this “original position”, what principles of justice would we agree to be bound by? What kind of social contract would we devise to ensure the society we lived in was a good one? Rawls argued that we would choose a set of basic liberties necessary for flourishing, including freedom of expression and of conscience, and a free choice of occupation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/14/free-and-equal-by-daniel-chandler-review-the-road-to-fairness">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It’s important to acknowledge ‘fertility privilege’, but let’s not dismiss those whose privilege has been hard won</p><p>I first came across the idea of “fertility privilege” in a <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/s2-ep-2-best-friend-therapy-fertility-whats-the/id1614793299?i=1000571029808">podcast</a> by the author Elizabeth Day, who has been admirably open about her desperate desire to be a mother after repeat miscarriages and fertility treatment. The podcast made me cry, though Day would be well within her rights to tell me to stuff my tears, because I got my baby. I joined the club. I have what she terms “fertility privilege”, ie I have conceived and carried a child without too much difficulty.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/what-not-to-say-to-a-childless-woman-infertility-ivf-miscarriage-elizabeth-day-qjh7vqdzm">an article</a> that caused something of a furore, Day wrote: “We rightly talk about privilege in this era of social change – an era marked by Black Lives Matter and #MeToo – but hardly anyone acknowledges fertility privilege. Those of us who have had complicated journeys to parenthood are only too aware of its existence. … I know how it feels to be the infertile one in a world of apparent abundance. I wouldn’t post about my glorious babies on social media in much the same way as I wouldn’t post about my expansive mansion or my fleet of Bentleys (not that I have any of those), because it’s thoughtless to those who don’t have these things.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/14/emotions-infertility-raw-solidarity-fertility-privilege">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Phoebe Waller-Bridge has received $60m from Amazon without making a new show, and it appears she’s not alone</p><p>How hard do you have to work to earn $60m in just three years? The answer, for Phoebe Waller-Bridge, at least, is not very hard at all. In 2019 the Emmy-winning creator of the hit TV show Fleabag signed a $20m-a-year deal with Amazon Studios. Originally, she was supposed to collaborate with Donald Glover on a series based on the 2005 movie Mr and Mrs Smith, but she reportedly left the show after a few months because of clashing creative styles. No worries, Amazon said, you can work on a Tomb Raider series instead. However, the <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/inside-amazon-studios-jen-salke-vision-shows-1235364913/">Hollywood Reporter</a> notes, since a showrunner (the person who has overall creative authority over a show) was also being hired, it’s questionable just how much work would actually be needed by the Fleabag creator. In short: Waller-Bridge has collected $60m from Amazon over the last few years without ever making a new show.</p><p>I’m not shaming Waller-Bridge, to be clear. I think this is brilliant work if you can get it. Taking away some of Jeff Bezos’s joyrides-in-space money as payment for staring into space? A+ work! And I should state for the record that Amazon Studios has rejected recent allegations that Waller-Bridge is being paid simply to exist. Apparently, she is “feeling very committed” to Tomb Raider and they expect her to be worth the money. “When she does deliver, she delivers,” the Amazon Studios head of television, Vernon Sanders, has said. Not everyone is so sure the deal was a good idea, however. One showrunner described Amazon’s behavior to the Hollywood Reporter as “star-fucking”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/14/phoebe-waller-bridge-amazon-deal-fleabag">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Her husband is missing, she earns improbable amounts of money from carving dishes and …  that’s all there is to Garner’s one-note character. Brace for a total lack of entertainment</p><p>Behold the rotten fruit of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/feb/17/big-little-lies-nicole-kidman-and-reese-witherspoon-shine-in-masterful-twist-on-desperate-housewives" title="">Big Little Lies</a>’ loins. Ever since Reese Witherspoon’s production company turned that Liane Moriarty novel into a glossy, compulsive TV hit series, no female-authored page-turner has been safe from miniseries adaptation. There was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/17/little-fires-everywhere-review-reese-witherspoon-kerry-washington" title="">Little Fires Everywhere</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/07/tiny-beautiful-things-review-kathryn-hahn-cheryl-strayed-disney" title="">Tiny Beautiful Things</a>; now, there is The Last Thing He Told Me, adapted from Laura Dave’s New York Times bestseller of 2021, with Jennifer Garner (the erstwhile star of 13 Going on 30 and the ex-wife of Ben Affleck) in the lead.</p><p>Garner plays Hannah, a fortysomething woman whose dreamy life in the picturesque waterside community of Sausalito, California, turns nightmarish when her husband’s software startup is raided by the FBI and he disappears into thin air. All that is left is a handwritten note with the instruction “PROTECT HER”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/14/the-last-thing-he-told-me-review-jennifer-garner-is-as-wooden-as-her-fancy-salad-bowls">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘I’m building a patchwork quilt’: Nicholas Hoult on fame, fatherhood and playing Dracula’s wingman

<p>The star of not one but two hot vampire films talks lockdown, eating caramel cockroaches and why he wants to make a romcom </p><p>In <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/12/renfield-review-gory-fun-as-nicolas-cage-gets-his-teeth-into-dracula">Renfield</a>, a comedy slasher about Dracula’s lickspittle victim, Nicholas Hoult eats insects for his super-strength, which is prodigious. He decapitates and disarms with ease, his eyes flash amber as his power grows, but otherwise he plays it with a self-effacing British charm so pure that it’s like watching Hugh Grant rebooted.</p><p>In a hotel in central London to talk about the film, he looks – well, first of all, weirdly young. His breakthrough role, in 2002, was Grant’s titular co-star in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0276751/">About a Boy</a>, though he appeared in his first film, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116643/">Intimate Relations</a>, six years before that, when he was five. So, he has now been in the business for nearly three decades, but, at 33, he has not just the face, but also the self-effacing manners, of someone much younger, as if he’s living his own, personal vampire story and got bitten by a svengali a century ago (or maybe by Grant in About a Boy?).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/14/im-building-a-patchwork-quilt-nicholas-hoult-on-fame-fatherhood-and-playing-draculas-wingman">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The country depends overwhelmingly on secondhand cars from Japan, which  makes barely any electric vehicles</p><p>New Zealand has long been known for its high ratio of sheep to people. But really what stands out on various per-capita lists is just how much we love to drive.</p><p>Exact comparisons are tricky and blurred by tiny countries, but we definitely have one of the highest rates of car ownership in the world, with something like nine cars for every 10 people, and each car driven over 8,000km a year. Given that a fifth of the population are children, this is a strikingly high rate of car ownership – and presents a key challenge to the country’s net zero goals.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2023/apr/14/is-driving-on-the-left-stopping-new-zealand-reaching-its-climate-goals">Continue reading...</a>
