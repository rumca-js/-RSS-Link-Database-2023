Film franchises getting prematurely canned is becoming increasingly common (my condolences to the seven people who were looking forward to that next Fantastic Beasts sequel).

I\u2019ve always regarded Invisibilia, which launched back in 2015, as one of podcasting\u2019s mainstays: one of, say, 10 shows that anyone who has even a passing interest in podcasts has probably heard of. It was clever in an unshowy way but also compulsively moreish, with great sound design and likable hosts. It felt like a podcasting dead cert \u2013 so for it to get a sudden scything feels ominous for the whole industry.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/apr/14/the-guide-podcasts\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/apr/14/the-guide-podcasts", "date_published": "2023-04-14 11:05:12+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "How Uniqlo\u2019s \u00a315 crossbody bag conquered the world", "description": "<p>In this week\u2019s newsletter: It wasn\u2019t the catwalk or even influencers that made this the bestselling bag of 2022 \u2013 it was good old-fashioned word of mouth</p><ul><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/sep/20/sign-up-for-the-fashion-statement-newsletter-our-free-fashion-email\">Don\u2019t get Fashion Statement delivered to your inbox?

Ben Brown, who fell five runs short of his hundred, and Keith Barker put on 96 for the seventh wicket, grinding runs and gathering a bonus point. Rory Burns and Dom Sibley saw Surrey through till stumps.<br /><br />A career-best seven for 84 for Lewis Gregory, on a pitch the colour of a lime jelly, kept <strong>Somerset</strong> in contention at Trent Bridge.

But it was Hameed\u2019s wicket which precipitated a collapse of five for 22. Stuart Broad opened the bowling for Notts, and immediately had Tom Lammonby dropped behind the stumps.<br /><br /><strong>Middlesex\u2019s</strong> top order continued its impression of a dropped trifle, as <strong>Northamptonshire\u2019s</strong> Ben Sanderson (three for 19) tucked in. Ryan Higgins was, once more, left to pick up the pieces, backed up by John Simpson \u2013 their only two players to make double figures.<br /><br /><strong>Durham\u2019s</strong> batters yet again started the round in fine fettle, this time against <strong>Worcestershire</strong>.

Suppose, Rawls suggested, that we are all behind what he calls a \u201cveil of ignorance\u201d, with knowledge of our talents, income and wealth, as well as our core values, temporarily erased. In this \u201coriginal position\u201d, what principles of justice would we agree to be bound by? What kind of social contract would we devise to ensure the society we lived in was a good one? Rawls argued that we would choose a set of basic liberties necessary for flourishing, including freedom of expression and of conscience, and a free choice of occupation.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/14/free-and-equal-by-daniel-chandler-review-the-road-to-fairness\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/14/free-and-equal-by-daniel-chandler-review-the-road-to-fairness", "date_published": "2023-04-14 06:30:05+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Official jewellery gifts to royals worth \u00a380m are not in national collection", "description": "<p>Palace refusing to explain why official state gifts worn by Princess of Wales and Camilla are not in the royal collection</p><p>Buckingham Palace is refusing to explain why 11 pieces of jewellery potentially worth \u00a380m that were official gifts to the royal family are not held in a trove of national heritage.</p><p>The jewels, which have been worn by Queen Elizabeth II; Camilla, the Queen Consort, and Catherine, Princess of Wales, are not contained in the royal collection, the custodian of culturally significant items held in trust for the nation.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/14/official-jewellery-gifts-to-royals-worth-80m-are-not-in-national-collection\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/14/official-jewellery-gifts-to-royals-worth-80m-are-not-in-national-collection", "date_published": "2023-04-14 06:29:56+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Dead Ringers to The Diplomat: the seven best shows to stream this week", "description": "<p>Rachel Weisz inhabits the weird, troubling Mantle twins in the new mini-series adapted from David Cronenberg\u2019s film, while a glossy thriller plunges a US ambassador into a huge international crisis</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/14/dead-ringers-to-the-diplomat-the-seven-best-shows-to-stream-this-week\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/14/dead-ringers-to-the-diplomat-the-seven-best-shows-to-stream-this-week", "date_published": "2023-04-14 06:00:05+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Emotions around infertility can be raw.

The answer, for Phoebe Waller-Bridge, at least, is not very hard at all. In 2019 the Emmy-winning creator of the hit TV show Fleabag signed a $20m-a-year deal with Amazon Studios. Originally, she was supposed to collaborate with Donald Glover on a series based on the 2005 movie Mr and Mrs Smith, but she reportedly left the show after a few months because of clashing creative styles. No worries, Amazon said, you can work on a Tomb Raider series instead. However, the <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/inside-amazon-studios-jen-salke-vision-shows-1235364913/\">Hollywood Reporter</a> notes, since a showrunner (the person who has overall creative authority over a show) was also being hired, it\u2019s questionable just how much work would actually be needed by the Fleabag creator. In short: Waller-Bridge has collected $60m from Amazon over the last few years without ever making a new show.</p><p>I\u2019m not shaming Waller-Bridge, to be clear. I think this is brilliant work if you can get it. Taking away some of Jeff Bezos\u2019s joyrides-in-space money as payment for staring into space? A+ work! And I should state for the record that Amazon Studios has rejected recent allegations that Waller-Bridge is being paid simply to exist. Apparently, she is \u201cfeeling very committed\u201d to Tomb Raider and they expect her to be worth the money. \u201cWhen she does deliver, she delivers,\u201d the Amazon Studios head of television, Vernon Sanders, has said.
