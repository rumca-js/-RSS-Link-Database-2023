In its release notes for the patch that added Overdrive Mode (along with Nvidia DLAA, Intel XeSS, and a revamped benchmark screen), CD Projekt Red says &ldquo;it requires the highest-performing hardware available to run it properly.&rdquo; Only the RTX 40-series lineup is technically supported, along with last-generation&rsquo;s RTX 3090 flagship&mdash;and that former titan is only rated to hit 30 frames-per-second at 1080p resolution, per CDPR. Gross.

Here&rsquo;s a video showing what it looks like, courtesy of an early Digital Foundry preview:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You&rsquo;ll find <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> Overdrive Mode performance results for the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html\">$1,600 GeForce RTX 4090</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1379747/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-tested-5-things.html\">$1,200 RTX 4080</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444726/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-review.html\">$900 RTX 4070 Ti</a> below. They were all tested on our <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html#toc-2\">usual GPU benchmarking system</a>, which runs on a Ryzen 9 5900X processor paired with 32GB of memory. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>Update: </strong>The <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1781139/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-review.html\">$599 GeForce RTX 4070</a> came out a day after this technical preview dropped, so it isn&rsquo;t included in the charts, but at the 1440p resolution the GPU is built for, it hits eight frames per second with path tracing on, but no DLSS active, while turning on DLSS Balanced and DLSS 3 Frame Gen propels it just past the hallowed 60fps mark. Don&rsquo;t try using it at 4K&mdash;even with DLSS 3 on, it can&rsquo;t hit a consistent 30fps, as Nvidia neutered the 4070&rsquo;s 4K chops.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>We <em>only</em> tested with Overdrive Mode active, at both 1440p and 4K resolutions, using the new Overdrive preset. Playing the game without path tracing enabled results in much higher frame rates, as our previous GPU reviews show. We then tested the game with DLSS on and manually set to Performance mode. (You can get slightly higher frame rates using Ultra Performance mode, but it made the upscaled image look terribly aliased and glitchy in our testing. Performance looks fine). Finally, we flipped on DLSS 3 Frame Generation as well to see just how fast this puppy can go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the results:</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"cyberpunk 2077 overdrive mode benchmarks\" class=\"wp-image-1782505\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cyberpunk-2077-overdrive-4k-perf.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1142\" width=\"1142\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"cyberpunk 2077 overdrive mode benchmarks\" class=\"wp-image-1782504\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cyberpunk-2077-overdrive-1440p-perf.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1142\" width=\"1142\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Nvidia and CDPR aren&rsquo;t joking when they say <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>&rsquo;s Overdrive Mode can bring even these monstrous GPUs to their knees. Without DLSS active, even the RTX 4090 struggles to spit out <em>20</em> frames-per-second at 4K, with the 4070 Ti hitting single digits. Ouch. Flipping on DLSS Performance mode alone gets you to the 60fps gold standard at 1440p resolution, but these results drive home a harsh truth: You need DLSS Frame Gen to hit smoothly playable frame rates in Overdrive Mode, especially at 4K resolution.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"the-best-gpu-for-cyberpunk-2077-overdrive-mode\">\n\t\t\t\t\tthe best gpu for cyberpunk 2077 overdrive mode\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"geforce-rtx-4090-founders-edition\">GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"1667\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Nvidia-GeForce-RTX-4090-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"2500\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review product-widget__review-details\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Editors' Choice\" class=\"product-widget__review-details--editors-choice-logo\" src=\"https://www.pcworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PC-ED-CHOICE.png\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__rating-and-review-link\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__review-details--rating\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>That said, if you&rsquo;re a fiend for drool-worthy gaming pics, CDPR tossed you a bone.

This is possible because it means rendering just one frame, as opposed to rendering several frames every second (i.e. FPS), which would happen when playing the game&hellip;</p><p>If your graphics card has more than 8GB VRAM and this option is still greyed out, it means you need to lower your in-game resolution.

You can enable Path Tracing for Photo Mode in Settings &gt; Graphics in the Ray Tracing section.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>So, there you have it. <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>&rsquo;s redemption story continues with Overdrive Mode, one of the most truly impressive technical feats ever pulled off in gaming graphics.

However, it also produces a line of premium, competition-ready game controllers. The Wolverine V2 is available in several flavors, including the PS5-optimized Pro and the colorful Chroma edition. The base model Wolverine we&rsquo;ve been testing offers most of the premium Razer features for half as much as those gamepads. Still, at $100, the Wolverine V2 is more expensive than <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/831843/xbox-wireless-controller-review.html\">Microsoft&rsquo;s Series X controller</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1533048/sony-dualsense-controller-review-a-gamepad-from-the-future.html\">Sony DualSense</a>, and it&rsquo;s not even wireless. Add-ons like the mechanical buttons and adjustable triggers help to justify the price, but you really want to wait for a sale on this one.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"razer-wolverine-v2-design-and-build-quality\">Razer Wolverine V2 design and build quality</h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Razer Wolverine V2 controller\" class=\"wp-image-1784351\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Razer-wolverine-v2-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Ryan Whitwam / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Razer doesn&rsquo;t do anything outlandish with the basic design of its controller. It&rsquo;s recognizable as an Xbox/PC controller with asymmetrical thumbsticks and standard ABXY button cluster. However, upon closer inspection, you will notice a few unusual aspects. For example, there are two extra buttons on the top edge, which you can program to do whatever you want. And what&rsquo;s this next to them? Switches to change the trigger travel distance, similar to the triggers on <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1367331/xbox-elite-controller-series-2-core-review.html\">Microsoft&rsquo;s Elite Series 2</a> gamepad. However, Razer only offers short and long options, whereas Microsoft&rsquo;s more expensive controller has three trigger settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The USB-A cable is non-removable and connects to the top of the controller. It&rsquo;s reasonably long at just under 10 feet (3 meters). If you&rsquo;re going to be stuck with one cable, USB-A is probably still the way to go, but in a few years, you might end up needing a USB-C adapter.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Razer Wolverine V2 controller top edge.\" class=\"wp-image-1784350\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Razer-wolverine-v2-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>The top edge of the Razer Wolverine V2 controller.</p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Ryan Whitwam / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the strangest design choice is the placement of the option and menu buttons, which are way up at the top of the face. You get all the other Xbox buttons in their usual arrangement, including the share button that debuted with the Series X/S. There&rsquo;s also a button below share that, when used in concert with the d-pad, lets you control the game and chat volume for wired headphones. You can plug those in with the 3.5mm jack on the bottom edge of the Wolverine V2.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget is-half-width is-float-right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"mentioned-in-this-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\tmentioned in this article\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"xbox-wireless-controller-2020\">Xbox Wireless Controller (2020)</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Xbox Wireless Controller (2020)\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/xbox-wireless-controller-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"2000\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review product-widget__review-details\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__rating-and-review-link\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__review-details--rating\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/831843/xbox-wireless-controller-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__pricing-details  \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.xbox.com/en-US/accessories/controllers/xbox-wireless-controller&amp;xcust=2-1-1784348-5-831856-10994&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$59.99 at  Microsoft</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>The overall shape of the controller is very hand-friendly, with L-shaped grips covered in textured soft-touch plastic. A strip of Razer green separates the grips from the face of the gamepad, but there are no glowing lights like with the DualSense or the Chroma Wolverine V2. This controller has Razer&rsquo;s custom &ldquo;Mecha-Tactile&rdquo; buttons for the ABXY cluster as well as the d-pad. They make a little more noise than other buttons, but the quicker response could appeal to many gamers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"razer-wolverine-v2-features-and-hands-on-experience\">Razer Wolverine V2 features and hands-on experience</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the Wolverine V2 lacks wireless connectivity, all you have to do to get started is plug in the USB cable. The Wolverine has a slightly wider footprint than Microsoft&rsquo;s standard controller, but the Razer gamepad is also lighter thanks to the lack of an internal battery. The thumbsticks are smooth, quiet, and have the right amount of resistance. They have the same rubberized feel as the grips, but they are not replaceable like the Xbox Elite controller or Razer&rsquo;s more expensive Wolverine variants.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>We truly like the way the Razer Wolverine V2 feels in the hand, thanks to the lower weight, clicky buttons, and adjustable triggers.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We can&rsquo;t say enough good things about the controller&rsquo;s Mecha-Tactile buttons. Other game controllers use membranes under the buttons, but Razer&rsquo;s buttons are more like the switches on a mechanical keyboard. They have very short travel (0.65mm) for a quick response, and the audible click and tactility make them very satisfying to press. They click on the press and return, and they&rsquo;ll make that noise for many thousands of presses. The noise is worth it as that means they&rsquo;ll also have the same excellent tactility even after uncountable hours of gaming. Membrane buttons are sometimes loud at first, but then get softer as the controller is broken in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re playing a shooter, the adjustable triggers will be a godsend. The switches on the back are easy to use and out of the way, so you don&rsquo;t accidentally snag them while playing. With the trigger travel limited, you&rsquo;ll be able to press much faster and with less movement. Not only is this good for fast-paced gameplay, but it&rsquo;s also easier on the joints. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Razer Wolverine V2 controller\" class=\"wp-image-1784353\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Razer-wolverine-v2-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Ryan Whitwam / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"razer-wolverine-v2-compatibility\">Razer Wolverine V2 compatibility</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Razer Wolverine V2 is an officially licensed Xbox accessory, so it&rsquo;s detected as an Xbox controller on both Windows and the Xbox. You can take screenshots with the share button and open the Xbox guide screen or Windows game bar with the Xbox button. There&rsquo;s no Bluetooth, so the Wolverine won&rsquo;t be useful to mobile gamers. We tested with a USB-C adapter and were unable to get the Wolverine working on an Android phone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Configuring the extra buttons requires a Razer Controller Setup app, which is available for both Windows and Xbox. The app is a bit clunky&mdash;it forces a full-screen Modern UI interface on Windows&mdash;but it only takes a few clicks to change the button mapping.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"is-the-razer-wolverine-v2-worth-it\">Is the Razer Wolverine V2 worth it?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Razer Wolverine V2 has a few things going for it. For one, the mechanical buttons feel great and should remain just as precise after years of use. Maybe it&rsquo;s just confirmation bias, but our in-game performance was better with the Wolverine than with the stock Xbox controller. The adjustable triggers and remappable buttons are also useful extras that we&rsquo;ve seen on much more expensive gamepads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, the Wolverine V2 lacks Bluetooth connectivity, and the USB-A cable is non-removable. The $100 MSRP is also tough to justify when the standard Xbox controller is $60 or less on sale and has Bluetooth. Despite that, we truly like the way this controller feels in the hand, thanks to the lower weight, clicky buttons, and adjustable triggers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most people looking for a new Xbox-style controller should look elsewhere&mdash;most gamers value wireless connectivity more than mechanical buttons or the Razer brand name. That said, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with the Wolverine V2 if you want a wired controller for PC or console use. $100 is too much, but luckily, it does go on sale relatively often. If you can get the Wolverine for closer to $70, it&rsquo;s a solid purchase.</p>\n\nComputer Accessories, Gaming, Gaming PCs</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1784348/razer-wolverine-v2-review.html", "date_published": "2023-04-14 14:30:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Hey gamers!

This Razer bundle includes the Cynosa Lite keyboard, the BlackShark V2 X headset, the Gigantus V2 mouse mat, and the Death Adder Essential mouse. It&rsquo;s currently on <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Razer-Power-Up-Gaming-Bundle-V2-Cynosa-Lite-Gigantus-V2-L-DeathAdder-Essential-BlackShark-V2-X/377460042&amp;xcust=2-1-1786608-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">sale for just $39 at Walmart</a>, which is a savings of $40. That&rsquo;s terrific value right there. I almost couldn&rsquo;t believe my eyes when I first spotted it. Let&rsquo;s get into the details of this bundle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, let&rsquo;s start with the Cynosa Lite keyboard. It features Chroma RGB lighting and a spill-resistant design. According to reviews on Walmart, the typing experience is surprisingly quiet. As for the wired BlackShark headset, it has breathable memory foam ear cushions, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.razer.com/technology/razer-triforce-drivers&amp;xcust=2-1-1786608-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">TriForce 50MM</a> audio drivers, and a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.razer.com/technology/razer-hyperclear-mic&amp;xcust=2-1-1786608-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">HyperClear Cardioid mic</a>. Razer claims the headset is designed to tune &ldquo;high, mid, and low audio frequencies individually.&rdquo; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Gigantus V2 mouse mat is soft and massive. It&rsquo;s made of textured micro-weave cloth, so your mouse should glide smoothly along the surface. Speaking of mice, the DeathAdder Essential has a maximum DPI of 6,400 and five programmable buttons. Here at PCWorld, we generally dig <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/632192/razer-deathadder-v2-x-hyperspeed-review.html\">DeathAdder mice</a>, as they&rsquo;re both reliable and ergonomic. The Essential isn&rsquo;t so sensitive that it&rsquo;ll get away from you either, making it a great pick for casual gamers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a phenomenal value. However, as of this writing, 500+ units have already been sold. You better hustle and nab this bundle, as we don&rsquo;t expect this deal to last long.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"cta wp-block wp-block-button\"><a class=\"cta__btn\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Razer-Power-Up-Gaming-Bundle-V2-Cynosa-Lite-Gigantus-V2-L-DeathAdder-Essential-BlackShark-V2-X/377460042&amp;xcust=2-1-1786608-7-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Get the Razer Power Up Gaming Bundle for $39 at Walmart</a></p>\nAccessories</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1786608/1786608.html", "date_published": "2023-04-14 13:59:29+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Doom scrolling is giving you brain rot", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/what-is-doomscrolling-and-why-is-it-bad-for-us/143139/&amp;xcust=2-1-1681249-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Doom scrolling</a>,&rdquo; the act of endlessly scrolling through social media feeds and news websites in search of negative or distressing information, has become an increasingly common behavior in today&rsquo;s digital age.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While many of us may engage in this behavior as a way to stay informed, a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9580444/&amp;xcust=2-1-1681249-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">growing body of research suggests</a> that doom scrolling may be doing more harm than good.

The constant stream of negative news and images can also disrupt sleep patterns and lead to emotional exhaustion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The behavior is often driven by a combination of factors, including the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8992377/#:~:text=Reward%20is%20a%20natural%20process,for%20that%20particular%20positive%20stimulus.&amp;xcust=2-1-1681249-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">brain&rsquo;s reward system</a>, which can be activated by the anticipation of getting new information, and the &ldquo;<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://positivepsychology.com/3-steps-negativity-bias/&amp;xcust=2-1-1681249-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">negativity bias</a>,&rdquo; which causes the brain to prioritize and remember negative information more than positive information. Social media algorithms and news outlets tend to prioritize and promote negative content to generate more engagement and clicks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"the-brains-reward-system\">The brain&rsquo;s reward system</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The brain&rsquo;s reward system is a complex network of structures and neurotransmitters that are involved in regulating feelings of pleasure and motivation. When we engage in activities that are pleasurable or rewarding, like eating or socializing, our brains release a chemical called <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22581-dopamine&amp;xcust=2-1-1681249-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">dopamine</a>, which helps to reinforce these behaviors and make us want to do them again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, when we engage in certain activities that are pleasurable in the short term but ultimately harmful, such as doom scrolling or excessive social media use, this can lead to brain rot. This is because these activities can actually alter the functioning of the brain&rsquo;s reward system, making it harder for us to feel pleasure and motivation from other activities that are more beneficial in the long term.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"A laptop with an AI brain\" class=\"wp-image-1511528\" height=\"1073\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/A-laptop-with-an-AI-brain.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG via Artbot/Stable Horde</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Doom scrolling, in particular, can be particularly <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://dana.org/article/how-addiction-hijacks-our-reward-system/&amp;xcust=2-1-1681249-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">damaging to the brain&rsquo;s reward system because it&rsquo;s a form of addictive behavior</a> that provides a constant stream of negative stimuli, such as news stories and social media posts that trigger feelings of anxiety, fear, and helplessness. Over time, this can lead to a desensitization to these negative stimuli, which can make it more difficult to experience positive emotions or derive pleasure from other things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To counteract this, it&rsquo;s important to take breaks from doom scrolling and other forms of excessive social media use and engage in other activities that are more beneficial to the brain&rsquo;s reward system, such as exercise, socializing with friends and family, or pursuing hobbies and interests that provide a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"the-consequences-of-doom-scrolling\">The consequences of doom scrolling</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The consequences of doom scrolling can be significant. This behavior can have several consequences on mental health, emotional well-being, and even physical health. Here are some of the major consequences of doom scrolling, which all contribute to brain rot:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Increased </strong><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.healthline.com/health/stress-and-anxiety&amp;xcust=2-1-1681249-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>anxiety and stress</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Constant exposure to negative news and information can trigger feelings of anxiety and stress, leading to a heightened sense of fear and helplessness.</li><li><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/depression/what-is-depression&amp;xcust=2-1-1681249-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Depression</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Prolonged doom scrolling can contribute to feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and despair, increasing the risk of developing or worsening depression.</li><li><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/insomnia&amp;xcust=2-1-1681249-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Insomnia</strong></a><strong> and sleep disturbances:</strong> Doom scrolling late into the night can disrupt our sleep patterns and make it harder to fall asleep or stay asleep, leading to chronic sleep disturbances that can have negative effects on our overall health and well-being.</li><li><strong>Decreased productivity:</strong> Constantly checking social media and news feeds can be distracting and can interfere with our ability to focus on tasks, leading to decreased productivity and performance.</li><li><strong>Physical health consequences:</strong> Chronic stress and sleep disturbances can have negative effects on our physical health, leading to an <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/stress/art-20046037&amp;xcust=2-1-1681249-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">increased risk of various health problems</a>.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, doom scrolling can have significant negative consequences for our mental and physical health. Keeping a healthy balance of news and social media consumption, and setting boundaries around social media platforms, helps to reduce the negative effects of doom scrolling.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-combat-doom-scrolling\">How to combat doom scrolling</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To prevent brain rot caused by doom scrolling, you need to be intentional about your media consumption habits and prioritize your mental well-being. One way to do this is to set limits on the amount of time you spend on social media and news websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should also diversify your media sources. Instead of focusing solely on negative news, check out content that educates, inspires, or entertains you. This can help maintain a balanced perspective on the world and foster a more positive mindset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you consume content is also important. Avoid social media and news before bedtime to prevent sleep disturbances. Instead, try reading a book, meditating, or taking a warm bath.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from setting a strict schedule of when you can consume news and engage in social media, you need to minimize the temptations. Turn off notifications for news and social media apps. This helps you create the necessary boundaries that prevent constant exposure to negative content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, you&rsquo;ll need to engage in activities that promote mental well-being, such as exercise, meditation, or pursuing hobbies. These activities can serve as a healthy distraction from doom scrolling and contribute to a more balanced and positive lifestyle.</p>\n\nInternet</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1681249/doom-scrolling-is-giving-you-brain-rot.html", "date_published": "2023-04-14 13:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "DLSS 3 explained: How Nvidia\u2019s AI-infused RTX tech turbocharges PC gaming", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>You might spend top dollar for fancy new graphics card hardware, but one of the key components to gaming performance is actually software. While the brute force of the hardware gets most of the glory (and is indeed essential), the software side is the magic that pieces it together. Without good software, even the ferocious <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html\">Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090</a> is reduced to a fancy paperweight&mdash;especially when running <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1782490/cyberpunk-2077-overdrive-mode-benchmarks-nvidia-rtx.html\"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>&lsquo;s glorious new path traced Overdrive mode</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Software can also substantially <em>improve</em> the hardware performance. Enter Nvidia&rsquo;s DLSS 3.0, or Deep Learning Super Sampling. Including both AI-powered frame generation and <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/393646/tested-how-nvidia-reflex-can-make-you-a-better-esports-gamer.html\">Nvidia&rsquo;s wondrous latency-reducing Reflex technology</a>, DLSS 3.0 makes for a potent recipe.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t the same old DLSS upsampling you&rsquo;re used to, however. We&rsquo;re going to go over some basics of what DLSS 3.0 is, and its application to Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX 40-series GPUs. We&rsquo;ll let you know how to use this feature, and tell you about optimal settings on some popular supported games. Let&rsquo;s get cracking.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>Further reading: </strong><a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/416006/the-best-graphics-cards-for-pc-gaming.html\">The best graphics cards for PC gaming</a></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-does-dlss-3-work\">How does DLSS 3 work?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>DLSS 3 greatly accelerates gaming frame rates using a mixture of AI tasks running on dedicated tensor cores. It has three components that make it tick.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Super Resolution (a.k.a. DLSS 2)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also known as super sampling, DLSS 3&rsquo;s core &ldquo;upscaler&rdquo; functionality is actually the DLSS 2 technology already integrated into countless games. DLSS renders game imagery at a lower resolution than your monitor runs at to increase raw gaming frame rates, then uses AI tensor cores to reconfigure the image with machine learning so that it looks sharp on your screen. This bypasses the performance penalty that your higher resolution would impose, while keeping graphics fidelity high.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Frame generation</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The novel element to DLSS 3 is in the &ldquo;Optical Multiframe Generation&rdquo; AI technology. After analyzing two images from a game back-to-back, DLSS 3 uses this information to insert an extra AI-created frame that does not have to be rendered by the game itself. This result is in even higher frame rates than standard DLSS 2. It can also help dramatically increase the smoothness in CPU bottlenecked games.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nvidia Reflex low latency</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third piece of the puzzle is in Nvidia&rsquo;s Reflex technology. Frame generation is not free. Those AI-generated frames aren&rsquo;t controlled by the player, since the game isn&rsquo;t rendering them, so it can actually add latency (read: reduce responsiveness) in games. To combat this, Nvidia Reflex helps harmonize the GPU and CPU so that latency is reduced. It helps to bypass the traditional bottlenecks presented by both the GPU and CPU by deeper integration into the game engine itself. Reflex was created years ago to <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/393646/tested-how-nvidia-reflex-can-make-you-a-better-esports-gamer.html\">improve performance in esports games to amazing effect</a>, but Nvidia now requires it in games that support DLSS 3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of&hellip;  &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What do you need to run DLSS 3?</strong></h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Nvidia DLSS 3\" class=\"wp-image-1662196\" height=\"813\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2022-12-06-at-3.09.37-PM.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>An RTX 40-series graphics card</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>DLSS 3 is exclusive to Nvidia&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ada Lovelace&rdquo; RTX 40-series graphics cards. It is available for both desktop and laptop offerings, but not any RTX 30-series or prior GPUs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nvidia says that&rsquo;s because the new Lovelace GPU architecture includes more powerful AI tensor cores and, more critically, a new &ldquo;Optical Flow Accelerator&rdquo; that provides scene movement info critical to creating those AI frames. Performance on RTX 30 or older GPUs would not provide a good experience, so for now this technology is limited to the more powerful hardware.&nbsp;Currently, four RTX 40-series graphics cards are available that meet those requirements:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html\">$1,600 RTX 4090</a></li><li>The <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1379747/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-tested-5-things.html\">$1,200 RTX 4080</a></li><li>The <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444726/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-review.html\">$800 RTX 4070 Ti</a></li><li>The <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1781139/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-review.html\">$600 RTX 4070</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>DLSS 3 is not supported on rival AMD Radeon or Intel Arc graphics cards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Certain Windows settings need to be active</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&rsquo;ll also need to turn on &ldquo;Hardware Accelerated GPU&rdquo; in your Windows display settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Certain in-game settings need to be active</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only specific games directly support DLSS 3. You&rsquo;ll have to turn on &ldquo;Frame Generation&rdquo; settings after activating DLSS upscaling. This will also necessitate &ldquo;Nvidia Reflex&rdquo; being turned on, and most (but not all) games will do this by default. You&rsquo;ll further have the option to set Reflex to additional &ldquo;Boost.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Supported DLSS 3 games</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are currently over 25 games that are playable now, with many more coming. High profile titles like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Forza Horizon 5 </em>have recently received DLSS 3 updates, along with new releases such as <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/confirmed-ray-tracing-and-dlss-games&amp;xcust=2-1-1662185-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rock Paper Shotgun</a> maintains a helpful guide to all available and upcoming DLSS 3 games (they&rsquo;re after the ray traced and DLSS games in the list).</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Nvidia DLSS 3\" class=\"wp-image-1662201\" height=\"651\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-13-at-12.02.11-PM.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>Hitman 3 menu: DLSS &nbsp;on Balanced, with Frame Generation and Reflex set to On.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-are-dlss-3s-drawbacks\">What are DLSS 3&rsquo;s drawbacks?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>DLSS 3 is fantastic for increasing overall visual smoothness, but as it develops during its early days, it also has a few potential issues to be aware of.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Latency</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Nvidia Reflex addresses a lot of DLSS 3&rsquo;s latency concerns, it&rsquo;s also not the rapid response some users may expect from esports titles. That&rsquo;s why DLSS 3 is better suited for single player games such as <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, <em>Plague Tale Requiem</em>, <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em>, etc.&nbsp;Even with Reflex on, DLSS 3 can play a sort of trick on your mind if you&rsquo;re especially sensitive to how fast frame rates and responsiveness are intertwined, as PCWorld&rsquo;s Brad Chacos explained during his review of the RTX 4090:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&ldquo;While the DLSS 3 experience shines, it doesn&rsquo;t always&nbsp;<em>feel</em>&nbsp;more responsive in your hands. Running&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>at 138fps with every possible bell and whistle active thanks to DLSS 3 looks absolutely stunning, full stop. But one of the perks of faster frame rates is increased responsiveness, and while Reflex greatly helps with that,&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>&nbsp;running at 138fps doesn&rsquo;t&nbsp;<em>feel</em>&nbsp;substantially more responsive than running it at the 77fps or so it hits in native 4K. Having twice as many frames looks fantastic but those AI frames aren&rsquo;t responding to your controls in the actual moment, though it&rsquo;s close.</p><p>This is not a negative. This is not a drawback. It can&rsquo;t be after running&nbsp;<em>Flight Sim&nbsp;</em>at 120fps, and&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>&nbsp;with ultra ray tracing at 138fps (the RTX 3090 tops out at 48fps). But it&rsquo;s worth highlighting.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Visual artifacts</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the DLSS 3 gaming experience looks fantastic. You won&rsquo;t notice any visual issues or quirks. That said, there are some games that showcase some onscreen &ldquo;artifacts&rdquo; or abnormalities. UI elements can also not be displayed properly in some titles, all areas that are undergoing improvement. The good news is that software updates can remedy these issues as gamers age. The Hardware Unboxed deep dive embedded below does a great job of walking through DLSS 3&rsquo;s visual quality, including highlighting potential quirks.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Needs powerful hardware</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>DLSS 3 shows some of its best results on already powerful hardware, like the Nvidia RTX 4080 or 4090. It also seems to do better when it&rsquo;s boosting an already-okay frame rate to a higher one, such as 60 FPS to 120 FPS. Time will tell if upcoming weaker GPUs such as the RTX 4060 will still have the same impressive results, but it should be promising.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Settings overload</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Console gamers have it easy without as much customization sometimes! PC games not only have dozens of graphics settings, but it also has different levels for each one. Add to that DLSS 3, which now has its own hierarchy of graphic settings to learn.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Nvidia DLSS 3\" class=\"wp-image-1662202\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-24.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>Hogwarts: Legacy has a lot of settings to tinker with, including DLSS tiers.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>DLSS 3 settings explained&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dozens more settings variations have entered the fray &ndash; making it confusing for gamers when choosing your graphics settings. After activating DLSS, Frame Generation, and Reflex, you have a few more choices to make.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>DLSS feature options</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>DLSS Auto</strong>: This will try and keep the frames as best it can to your monitor&rsquo;s refresh rate</li><li><strong>DLSS Quality</strong>: The best visual performance, with modest or not much FPS uplift&nbsp;</li><li><strong>DLSS Balanced</strong>: A good combination of higher frames and maintaining graphical fidelity.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>DLSS Performance</strong>: You&rsquo;ll notice somewhat less impressive visuals, but FPS frames are considerably higher.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>DLSS Ultra-performance</strong>: Better FPS, but worse visuals &ndash; typically when you really want to overreach existing hardware or to hit a specific FPS at a higher resolution. (8K Gamers, you&rsquo;ll want to learn this one!)&nbsp;</li><li><strong>DLSS Frame Generation</strong>: This setting will just be a simple &ldquo;On or Off&rdquo; toggle in your game settings. Remember, you&rsquo;ll need Ada Lovelace RTX 40 series GPUs to work.&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Nvidia Reflex and Boost</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>These are often found near DLSS options, but may be elsewhere in a video menu as well (as in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>). Nvidia Reflex will often be turned on automatically in most games with Frame Generation being active. That&rsquo;s not always true, however, and many games let you disable Reflex manually even when running DLSS 3 Frame Gen. (We don&rsquo;t recommend doing that.) You&rsquo;ll also have the option for a &ldquo;Boost&rdquo; feature in many games. Reflex Boost overclocks your GPU so it can help in CPU limited scenarios even more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Even more options</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To make matters a bit more complicated, some games even allow you to select only <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.techpowerup.com/review/nvidia-dlaa-anti-aliasing/&amp;xcust=2-1-1662185-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nvidia&rsquo;s DLAA</a> along with Frame Generation and Reflex. <em>Plague Tale&rsquo;s Requiem</em> is one such title. DLAA basically runs DLSS at your native monitor resolution for enhanced visual sharpness and clarity. When given this option, it offers the highest possible graphical setting you can achieve, balanced out by the obvious performance cost. You can usually choose DLSS instead if the DLAA performance is too low.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In most games, such as <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, DLAA will automatically be grayed out when you select DLSS.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The best DLSS 3 settings</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"the-most-powerful-gpu-is-a-dlss-3-monster\">\n\t\t\t\t\tThe most powerful gpu is a dlss 3 monster\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"geforce-rtx-4090-founders-edition\">GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"GeForce RTX 4090 Founders Edition\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"1667\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Nvidia-GeForce-RTX-4090-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"2500\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review product-widget__review-details\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Editors' Choice\" class=\"product-widget__review-details--editors-choice-logo\" src=\"https://www.pcworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PC-ED-CHOICE.png\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__rating-and-review-link\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__review-details--rating\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s how we use DLSS 3 settings in our own rigs. For the most powerful hardware, such as the RTX 4080 and 4090, DLSS Quality should keep respectable frames in most games, even at 4K, and doubly so with DLSS Frame Generation enabled.&nbsp; If you prefer a bit more pep in performance, DLSS Balanced would be the next ideal step.&nbsp; You can also always just set DLSS to Auto and see if you&rsquo;re happy with the results, as they will vary from game-to-game.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have slightly less powerful hardware, such as the RTX 4070 or some mobile RTX 40 GPUs, DLSS Balanced and DLSS Performance become good settings to make sure you&rsquo;re hitting good frames, with the nod still going to DLSS Balanced as preferred.&nbsp;We&rsquo;d typically recommend avoiding DLSS Ultra Performance, as it upscales from such a low resolution image that it degrades visual fidelity a noticeable amount.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some games are just more demanding than others, so you&rsquo;ll be able to judge if changes are needed, especially when adding ray tracing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>DLSS 3: Let&rsquo;s play some games!&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"msi-titan-gt77-hx-13v\">MSI Titan GT77 HX 13V</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"MSI Titan GT77 HX 13V\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/msi-titan-gt77-4-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1500\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review product-widget__review-details\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Editors' Choice\" class=\"product-widget__review-details--editors-choice-logo\" src=\"https://www.pcworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PC-ED-CHOICE.png\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__rating-and-review-link\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__review-details--rating\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1561127/msi-titan-gt77-hx-13v-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>Time to put this theory to practice. We&rsquo;re going to play some particularly intense games and see how DLSS 3 can help. These games were tested at 4K, generally with Ultra or similar max settings, and ray tracing on. The hardware is an <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1561127/msi-titan-gt77-hx-13v-review.html\">MSI Titan GT77 laptop with a 4090 inside</a>, which is similar to an RTX 3090 Ti desktop GPU in performance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that this is at 4K, so people playing at lower resolutions such as 1440p or 1080p will always see higher FPS in general. Ray tracing also substantially lowers frame rates when on, so disabling that is another way you can achieve higher numbers. The idea with DLSS 3 is that we can have our cake and eat it too! You can experience ray tracing on Ultra, then flip on DLSS 3 to achieve better performance without compromising on other visual settings.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>DLSS 3: Cyberpunk 2077</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> has been around for a few years now, and recently it received DLSS 3 support. This game is notorious for crushing almost any GPU when ray tracing is on Ultra so it&rsquo;s welcomed news.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Nvidia DLSS 3\" class=\"wp-image-1662205\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/nodlssnoframegen.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>Ray tracing Ultra, DLSS Off at 4K.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s go over how some of the settings affect the overall performance by really pushing the system. On the MSI GT77 Titan, ray tracing on Ultra without any DLSS gives us a measly 27 FPS in this portion. That frame rate is too low to actually play, so let&rsquo;s see how DLSS 3 can help us without having to reduce any other graphics settings.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Nvidia DLSS 3\" class=\"wp-image-1662206\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/dlssbalnoframegen.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>DLSS Set to Balanced, without Frame Generation or Reflex.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, let&rsquo;s turn on DLSS to Balanced, but without switching on Frame Generation or Nvidia Reflex. Our frame rate jumps to 61, a much better result. The game still looks great and behaves much smoother with this extra FPS boost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"A picture containing text, tollbooth, bus\n\nDescription automatically generated\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Sq2B21BRPU_6Q_9lz4v8e5BAvmN14M1iPPxI00vkUeSKiqSQrPHGOwarH6O9OJdx9waPqxof_7Vn7xUP-xFfNjiVNdBp9PF9p598hTdIosX9hbA-1wjTrHXMGMnaVLaRjXxJfVP2k3SCd-z7nVD4iQ\" style=\"width: 1200px;\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our next option will have us once again setting DLSS to Balanced, but this time we&rsquo;re also going to turn on Frame Generation in the menu. Nvidia Reflex, on the adjacent &ldquo;Video&rdquo; menu, will also be on. The result here is substantially better&mdash;a whopping 87 FPS. Remember that we started with just 27 FPS before turning on any DLSS features.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How does it play with DLSS 3 Frame Gen active? Quite well, actually. It feels superior in every way to native rendering, or with just regular DLSS on. The game play is smooth, and no glaringly obvious artifacts or issues present themselves. (They can still happen, however, such as UI elements being a bit quirky at times.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only downside here is that you&rsquo;re increasing latency, which is somewhat by Nvidia Reflex. The latency in this game is acceptable, as it&rsquo;s mostly a single player game where you&rsquo;re exploring and occasionally engaging in faster scenes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A faster paced game, such as an online multiplayer esports title, is not an ideal match for DLSS 3 due to this latency factor.&nbsp; In <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, it works beautifully. You can also turn on Frame Generation and Reflex without DLSS, giving you FPS of around 47, but here the greater benefit seems to be pairing it with DLSS so you can achieve maximum frame rates.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Nvidia DLSS 3\" class=\"wp-image-1662209\" height=\"1021\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/dlss3-cyberpunk.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption><p>From Brad Chacos&rsquo; RTX 4090 review.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Brad Chacos</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In Brad Chacos&rsquo; <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html\">RTX 4090 desktop GPU review</a>, we can see that even this ferocious flagship gets massive help from DLSS 3. Playing it at 4K resolution with ray tracing at Ultra pins the game to 42 FPS, but DLSS performance with Frame Generation brings it to 138 FPS. These are staggering numbers&mdash;with ray tracing still on!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>DLSS 3: Hitman 3</strong></h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Nvidia DLSS 3\" class=\"wp-image-1662212\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/nodflss.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>Hitman 3 without DLSS at 4K, and all settings maxed out to their highest.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hitman 3</em> is a popular game that also taxes systems quite heavily. With ray tracing on and DLSS off, this scene gave us only around 30 FPS at maxed-out 4K settings. This game is much like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, in the sense that it&rsquo;s a slower paced style game, so DLSS 3 can be a big help here.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Nvidia DLSS 3\" class=\"wp-image-1662213\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/dlssnbalnoframegen.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>Hitman 3: DLSS Balanced only, no Frame Generation or Reflex.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Switching DLSS on to Balanced, but keeping Frame Generation Off, wielded 64 FPS. That&rsquo;s surely a significant boost, and makes the game feel tremendously more playable and smooth.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Nvidia DLSS 3\" class=\"wp-image-1662216\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/dlssbalframegen.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>DLSS Balanced, with Frame Generation and Reflex On.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, switching DLSS to Balanced, but turning on both Frame Generation and Reflex, give us truly impressive results. We&rsquo;re now around 91 FPS, a big leap from the original 30 FPS without DLSS 3. The game feels much smoother, and behaves very well. It&rsquo;s difficult to even notice the DLSS process occurring unless you&rsquo;re pixel-peeping for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like with the other games, latency will also be increased, and helped with Nvidia Reflex. This title is one that benefits much more from the higher FPS and better performance, and any additional latency is not very noticeable. You can also select only Frame generation and Reflex without DLSS, giving you around 50 FPS. We&rsquo;d still recommend going all the way with DLSS Quality or Balanced however, so you get all of the combined DLSS 3 benefits.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>DLSS 3: Hogwarts Legacy</strong></h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Nvidia DLSS 3\" class=\"wp-image-1662219\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/nodlssnoframegen-1.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>Hogwarts legacy: No DLSS, Ray Tracing Ultra 4K.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Continuing the trend of highly taxing ray traced titles, we arrive at <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>. Without any DLSS, and when set to Nvidia DLAA, this scene in Hogmeade netted us only 36 FPS at 4K. Ick. Ray tracing and all settings are set to Ultra.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Nvidia DLSS 3\" class=\"wp-image-1662220\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/dlssbal.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption> DLSS Balanced, no Frame Generation or Reflex.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>We see better results with DLSS set to Balanced, with frame rates hitting around 59. The game feels much better already, and even the frame rate time seems more consistent. (You can also turn on just Frame Generation without DLSS, getting around 56 FPS, but your latency will also increase more that way, so better to pair it with DLSS.)</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Nvidia DLS 3\" class=\"wp-image-1662223\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/dlssframegenbal.png?w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>DLSS Balanced, Frame Generation and Reflex On.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>DLSS Balanced alongside Frame Generation and Reflex give us 82 FPS, a huge boost from the 36 FPS we first saw. The game plays considerably better, with much more consistent and smooth performance. Without DLSS 3, we&rsquo;d have to lower ray tracing or adjust other settings to achieve better results, so this is certainly a much more preferable option.&nbsp;Reflex kept the game feeling nice and responsive.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>DLSS 3: Flight Simulator 2020</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 is a notoriously difficult game to max out thanks to its beautifully expansive open world. It&rsquo;s a highly CPU bottlenecked game, making a perfect pairing with DLSS 3.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Nvidia DLSS 3\" class=\"wp-image-1662228\" height=\"1005\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/dlss-3-flight-sim.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption><p>From Brad Chacos&rsquo; RTX 4090 review.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Brad Chacos</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The results here are nothing short of impressive. With the desktop RTX 4090 and a Ryzen 9 5900X processor, 4K native hits a playable 65 FPS&mdash;a standard result for this heavily CPU-bottlenecked game. Turning on Frame Generation and bypassing that bottleneck brings us to 122 FPS, almost doubling the visual smoothness by blowing past the bottleneck with AI frames. Nvidia Reflex helps to keep the latency in check, and this is a game generally well suited to DLSS 3 improvements.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This title also has numerous detailed UI and in-cabin graphics that have to be generated properly, so it&rsquo;s a great test of how DLSS 3 can render minute details in sharp clarity. While it&rsquo;s not always perfect, the boost in FPS and bypassing CPU bottlenecks are more than a win here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>DLSS 3: Final thoughts&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nvidia&rsquo;s DLSS 3 combines the great benefits of DLSS, along with Frame Generation and Nvidia Reflex. While support is still limited to select games and hardware, and there are sometimes niggling artifacting and text issues, it&rsquo;s extraordinarily promising.&nbsp;By allowing GPUs to stretch their legs well beyond traditional hardware limits, we can experience higher and better frontiers in games as developers take advantage of the technology.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, you&rsquo;re getting some more latency, but Nvidia Reflex does a good job at keeping it under control. Often, it makes DLSS 3 games even <em>more</em> responsive than running at native resolution.

Being the first PCIe 5.0 drive we&rsquo;ve tested, that&rsquo;s hardly surprising. But it is quite delightful to see a drive sustain reads and writes over 10GBps. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-are-the-gigabyte-aorus-gen5-10000-specs\">What are the Gigabyte Aorus Gen5 10000 specs?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Aorus Gen5 10000 wouldn&rsquo;t be much to look at on its own. It&rsquo;s your usual 2280 (22mm wide, 80mm long) M.2 NVMe SSD with a plain-ish black label. That&rsquo;s if you omit the massive heatsink that Gigabyte provides. And I mean massive. See below. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>Further reading:</strong> See our roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407542/best-ssds.html\">best SSDs</a> to learn about competing products.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Gigabyte Aorus Gen5 10000 SSD heatsink\" class=\"wp-image-1780663\" height=\"760\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Aorus-Gen5-10000-c.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>The massive heatsink that accompanies the Auros Gen5 10000 in the box.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Jon L. Jacobi</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>This heatsink is overkill for most users, and during our benchmarking the drive ran relatively cool, never once threatening to throttle during multiple benchmark runs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Gen5 10000 uses Phison&rsquo;s new E26 controller and the latest 232-layer 3D TLC NAND. Though the drive is not widely available yet, we did see it available online for $340 in the 2TB flavor we tested. That&rsquo;s roughly twice what a bargain 2TB PCIe 4.0 drive will cost, and three times a PCIe 3.0 SSD. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Gigabyte Aorus Gen5 10000 SSD angle\" class=\"wp-image-1780661\" height=\"723\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Aorus-Gen5-10000-b.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>The Gigabyte Auros Gen5 10000 without its heatsink.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Jon L. Jacobi</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The drive is covered by a limited five-year warranty. The limit is a 700TBW (terabytes that may be written) per 1TB of capacity rating. That&rsquo;s not very generous given the rather steep pricing, though some of that pricing reflects the presence of the huge heatsink. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-fast-is-the-gigabyte-aorus-gen5-10000\">How fast is the Gigabyte Aorus Gen5 10000?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Does PCIe 5 make a difference? Yes. Big time, if you go by synthetic benchmarks; marginally, if you go by real-world transfers. As you can see below, the Aorus Gen5 10000 destroyed the competition in CrystalDiskMark 8&rsquo;s sustained throughput tests. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Said competition was the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/828399/wd-black-sn850x-ssd-review.html\">WD SN850X</a>, the fastest PCIe 4.0 SSD we&rsquo;ve tested, and the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/793848/crucial-p3-review-top-pcie-3-speed-insanely-low-price.html\">Crucial P3</a> which is a very fast entry-level PCIe 3.0 SSD. The three drives should give you a good idea of the relative performance across the generations of PCIe. Note that the Gen5 10000 is also NVMe 2.0 where the others are 1.4 max.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>The Aorus Gen5 10000 destroyed the competition in CrystalDiskMark 8&rsquo;s sustained throughput tests.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1780572\" height=\"524\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Aorus-Gen5-CDM8-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption>If the CrystalDiskMark 8 numbers translated into real life, you&rsquo;d be talking massive gains in performance. Alas, they are only partially applicable.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Sobering the discussion quite a bit is the lack of effect that PCIe 5.0 seems to have with random performance. Indeed, if these numbers are to be believed, you&rsquo;re better off running your operating system with the WD SN850X than the Aorus Gen5 10000. Save the latter for large file transfers.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1780638\" height=\"524\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Aorus-Gen5-CDM8-rnd.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption>Random performance seems far less affected by PCIe 5.0&rsquo;s greater bandwidth. In fact, as you can see, the Gen5 10000 lost badly to the WD SN850X.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our real-world 48GB transfers, the Gen5 10000 is indeed faster than previous generations, but again, not by the same large margins we saw in the synthetic benchmarks. Note that there are PCIe 4.0 SSDs that are even faster in this test than the SN850X.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1780526\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Aorus-Gen5-48GB.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>While the Gen5 10,000 offers a noticeable improvement in our 48GB transfers, it&rsquo;s not nearly the margin you get in synthetic benchmarks.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, during our 450GB write test shown below, the margin of victory, while welcome, was decidedly underwhelming. However, this test is also dependent upon the drive transferring the file (a Samsung 990 Pro). We actually run this test to see if the transfer bogs down at any point due to lack of, or poor secondary NAND caching (writing as single-bit SLC rather than three-bit TLC). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All three drives are 2TB, meaning secondary cache shouldn&rsquo;t factor in, and didn&rsquo;t slow at any point.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1780527\" height=\"596\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Aorus-Gen5-450GB.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1197\" /><figcaption>Though 5 seconds is a nice improvement, subjectively it would be hard to notice. Note that this test is also dependent upon the drive (a Samsung 990 Pro) delivering the file. This test is designed to reveal issues with secondary caching, not necessarily real-world performance.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing I did notice is that the Gen5 10000 is relatively slow formatting, taking up to 15 seconds. I&rsquo;ve experienced this with other SSDs on occasion. It may be that the drive is house-keeping the NAND so that it&rsquo;s cleared and ready for action without incurring erase-before-write performance penalties before the next TRIM operation occurs.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>Internal drive tests currently utilize Windows 11 64-bit running on an X790 (PCIe 5.0) motherboard/i5-12400 CPU combo with two Kingston Fury 32GB DDR5 modules (64GB of memory total). Intel integrated graphics are used. The 48GB transfer tests utilize an ImDisk RAM disk taking up 58GB of the 64GB total memory. The 450GB file is transferred from a Samsung 990 Pro 2TB. </em></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>Each test is performed on a newly formatted and TRIM&rsquo;d drive so the results are optimal. Note that in normal use, as a drive fills up, performance will decrease due to less NAND for caching, as well as other factors.</em></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>The performance numbers shown apply only to the drive we were shipped and of the capacity tested. SSD performance can vary by capacity due to more or fewer chips to shotgun reads/writes across and the amount of NAND available for secondary caching.</em> <em>Vendors also occasionally swap components. If you ever notice a large discrepancy between the performance you experience and that which we report (systems being roughly equal), please let us know.</em></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that PCWorld just updated its test bed to a new platform with PCIe 5.0 M.2, as well as onboard Thunderbolt/USB4 and 20MBps USB. The test bed now uses integrated Intel graphics in lieu of a discrete GPU. All the SSDs listed in the charts were retested on the new platform, so the numbers may not match those in their individual reviews.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-platform-do-i-need-for-the-gigabyte-aorus-gen5-10000\">What platform do I need for the Gigabyte Aorus Gen5 10000?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s, of course, the elephant in the room: the relative lack of PCIe 5.0 support for SSDs. Though PCIe 5.0 is no longer a rarity in mid- to high-priced motherboards, M.2 slots that support it are. Indeed, picking the motherboard for our test bed was a chore because of this. Also, there&rsquo;s a dearth of PCIe 5.0 M.2 adapter cards for utilization in the far more common PCIe 5.0 slots. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there&rsquo;s the need for a late model CPU. Only Intel&rsquo;s 12th- and 13th-gen processors support PCIe 5.0. None of the current Intel chipsets do, so the platform controller hub is still limited to PCIe 4.0. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>AMD&rsquo;s latest Ryzen CPUs support PCIe 5.0, and offer quite a few more lanes so it&rsquo;s easier to run both graphics cards and SSDs at the new standard. That had us interested, but Intel&rsquo;s native support for Thunderbolt 4/USB4, which we need to test occasionally, was the difference maker, along with price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If our considerations aren&rsquo;t yours, then you&rsquo;re just as well off with AMD for PCIe 5.0 SSDs. </p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget is-half-width is-float-right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"our-favorite-pcie-4-0-ssd\">\n\t\t\t\t\tOur favorite Pcie 4.0 SSD\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"wd-black-sn850x\">WD Black SN850X</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"WD Black SN850X\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"696\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/WD_BLACK-SN850X-NVMe-SSD-flat.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"2000\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review product-widget__review-details\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Editors' Choice\" class=\"product-widget__review-details--editors-choice-logo\" src=\"https://www.pcworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PC-ED-CHOICE.png\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__rating-and-review-link\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__review-details--rating\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/828399/wd-black-sn850x-ssd-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__pricing-details  \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/321564/1175784/1036?prodsku=WDBB9G1BNC&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fwdbb9g1bnc.html&amp;intsrc=CATF_9102&amp;subid1=2-1-1681210-5-828400-11151\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$94.99 at  Adorama</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"amp-bar\"> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B7CKVCCV?tag=pcworld02-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;xcust=2-1-1681210-5-828400-11151&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$94.99 at  Amazon</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"amp-bar\"> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/321564/633495/10014?prodsku=6512131&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.bestbuy.com%2Fclick%2F-%2F6512131%2Fpdp&amp;intsrc=CATF_4831&amp;subid1=2-1-1681210-5-828400-11151\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$99.99 at  Best Buy</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<h2 id=\"is-the-gigabyte-aorus-gen5-10000-worth-it\">Is the Gigabyte Aorus Gen5 10000 worth it?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt that the Aorus Gen5 10000 is the fastest NVMe SSD for sustained throughput that we&rsquo;ve tested.
