  <p id="SrHr5g">Sega is reportedly close to buying Rovio Entertainment — the company that owns the <em>Angry Birds</em> mobile game franchise — for a whopping $1 billion, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sega-nears-deal-for-angry-birds-mobile-game-maker-12bc7984">according to <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>. Sega may lock in the big deal by early next week, according to people speaking with <em>WSJ</em>.</p>
<p id="oHSifl">It’s surprising to think that Sega — specifically, its parent company Sega Sammy Holdings — would want to spend so much on Rovio given the decline in popularity of the <em>Angry Birds</em> games. The original game was a smash success in 2009, but the franchise has seemingly fallen off since its 2014 peak, when Rovio reported <a href="http://time.com/3750618/angry-birds-rovio-profits/">falling profits</a> and <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/10/2/6893259/rovio-may-lay-off-130-as-growth-slows">layoffs</a>.</p>
<p id="HsfG23">In 2016, Rovio tried a movie adaptation, <em>The Angry Birds Movie, </em>which was a box office success and is still the seventh <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films_based_on_video_games">highest...</a></p>

  <p id="EPFAgT">A massive blaze at a plastic recycling facility in Richmond, Indiana, is a terrifying reminder that plastics are a pollution nightmare, one that recycling can’t fix. The fire started Tuesday night at a recycling and resale warehouse, which officials described as six buildings filled from floor to ceiling with plastic waste.</p>
<p id="i2u1tB">“We’re looking at close to 14 acres worth of plastic that’s piled everywhere,” Richmond Fire Department chief Tim Brown said at a press conference on Wednesday. “The entire complex is either burning or has burned.”</p>
<p id="tJLP8j">A billowing column of black smoke hovered over the burning facility and the surrounding community. Some 2,000 residents within half a mile of the fire were forced to evacuate because the smoke is toxic....</p>

  <p id="tPkv5v">Twitter Blue subscribers now have a maximum tweet length of 10,000 characters and support for bold and italic text formatting. The <a href="https://twitter.com/twitterwrite/status/1646674962055565319">announcement</a> comes just weeks after the character limit for Twitter Blue was first bumped up from 280 characters <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/8/23591472/twitter-blue-subscribers-longer-tweets-4000-characters">to 4,000 back in February</a>, with the latest increase and additional formatting features seemingly designed to help Twitter compete with newsletter platforms like Substack — which has recently found itself <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/6/23673067/twitter-api-shutdown-bots-botpocalypse-begins">in Elon Musk’s crosshairs</a>.</p>

  <p id="sqQEkb">Hackers who claim to have breached Western Digital have reportedly stolen around 10 terabytes of data from the company and are holding it hostage. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/13/hackers-claim-vast-access-to-western-digital-systems/?guccounter=1"><em>TechCrunch </em>spoke to the hackers</a> who appear to have control over Western Digital’s code-signing certificate, private phone numbers belonging to company executives, stolen SAP Backoffice data, and even managed to gain administrator access to Western Digital’s Microsoft Azure instance.</p>

  <p id="OrVRey">A new drone video has surfaced showing the Cybertruck’s ridiculously large windshield wiper in action. And you know what? It’s functional — and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/4/23625131/the-cybertruck-wiper-does-not-appear-to-extend">perhaps improved</a> — but still doesn’t reach a good chunk of the glass in front of the passenger.</p>
<p id="6965t7">The video shot by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BradSloanvideos">Brad Sloan</a> above Tesla’s Texas Gigafactory location on Thursday (and <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/04/13/first-video-of-tesla-cybertrucks-absurdly-large-windshield-wiper-in-action/">surfaced by <em>Electrek</em></a>) shows the Cybertruck undergoing a wind tunnel test. At the 13:42 mark you can see the truck’s single XL wiper blade start moving, with decent reach across the majority of windshield. Maybe it’s the angle, but it does seem like an improvement over some prototypes we’ve seen.</p>
