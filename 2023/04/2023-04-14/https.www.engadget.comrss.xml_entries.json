Despite her obvious talent, numerous employers declined to hire her after graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. For example, Sikorsky Aircraft told her they would never pay her requested salary, equivalent to the lowest rank in the civil service. Another food lab she applied for asked her to promise not to get pregnant as a condition of her employment. (She withdrew her application.) Finally, the gun manufacturer Remington appreciated her \u201cbrilliant\u201d ideas in an interview but told her they were hiring a man instead.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Her career finally progressed after landing jobs with the US Army Signal Corps Laboratories (where she designed a radar reflector for weather balloons) and Sylvania Electronic Defense Labs (where she set up the company\u2019s first antenna lab). Norwood began working in the 1950s as one of a small group of women at Hughes Aircraft Company, where she gained a reputation as a resourceful problem-solver. \u201cShe said, \u2018I was kind of known as the person who could solve impossible problems,\u2019\u201d her daughter, Naomi Norwood, told NASA. \u201cSo people would bring things to her, even pieces of other projects.\u201d</p><figure><img alt=\"1963 black &amp; white image of Virginia Norwood, sittind down with a sly smile on her face.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/60865b80-db09-11ed-bff7-6afe267cc1fd\" style=\"height: 431px; width: 720px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Hughes Aircraft / NASA</div></figure><p>In the late 1960s, the director of the Geological Survey wanted to take photographs of the Earth from space to help manage land resources; partnering with NASA, a plan was hatched to send satellites into space. Then working on an advanced design team in Hughes\u2019 space and communications division, Norwood formed the idea that would define her legacy. She gathered feedback from agriculture, meteorology and geology experts to develop a scanner to record different light and energy spectra. Although it used existing technology made for (lower-altitude) agricultural observations, she adapted the tech to meet the Geological Survey\u2019s and NASA\u2019s goals.</p><p>However, she faced numerous obstacles in securing a spot for her Multispectral Scanner System (MSS) on the launch satellite. It was already hauling an enormous three-camera system developed by RCA using television tube technology, which the agencies viewed as the primary imaging source. To get the MSS onboard, Norwood was tasked with scaling back its size to no more than 100 lbs, a significant downsizing; the RCA system took up most of the satellite\u2019s 4,000 lb. payload.</p><p>She reduced the device to recording only four energy bands (down from its original seven) to ensure it would make the trip as a secondary measurement system. The satellite launched on July 23rd, 1972, and the MSS captured its first images \u2014 of Oklahoma\u2019s Ouachita Mountains \u2014 two days later. The results exceeded all expectations, forcing a quick reevaluation of the satellite payload\u2019s hierarchy. Norwood\u2019s system performed better and was more reliable than the clunky RCA project, which caused power surges and had to be shut down for good two weeks into the mission.</p><p>Landsat quickly became the de facto method of surveying the Earth\u2019s surface. Norwood continued to improve the system, leading the development of Landsat 2, 3, 4 and 5. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2013-02-12-nasa-launches-landsat-8-satellite.html\">Landsat 8</a> and 9, the current versions monitoring the effects of climate change today, are still based on her initial concept. Her other projects included leading the microwave group in Hughes Aircraft\u2019s missile lab and designing the ground-control communications equipment for NASA\u2019s Surveyor lunar lander.</p><p>She reportedly had no issue with the \u201cthe mother of Landsat\u201d moniker her peers gave her. \u201cYes, I like it, and it\u2019s apt,\u201d she said. \u201cI created it, I birthed it, and I fought for it.\u201d</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/remembering-virginia-norwood-the-mother-of-nasas-landsat-program-213705046.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/remembering-virginia-norwood-the-mother-of-nasas-landsat-program-213705046.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-14 21:37:05+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Montana is about to become the first state to ban TikTok", "description": "<p>Montana is poised to become the first state to ban TikTok.

itself. The speaker is about the size (and sort of looks like) a clutch bag, but still manages to deliver good clarity and significant bass.

The router will cover 2,000 square feet, offers support for WiFi 6 and can deliver speeds of up to a gigabit per second. If you've got a lot of smart home devices, the Eero Pro 6 can connect up to 75 of them at once.

Researchers used a breakthrough combination of indirect and direct planetary detection to locate the distant world known as HIP 99770 b. It could inch us closer to finding Earth-like exoplanets among our (distantly) neighboring stars.</p><p>Direct imaging is what most casual observers would expect to lie at the heart of exoplanet hunting: using powerful telescopes with advanced optics to capture images of distant planetary bodies. However, direct imaging is most effective for planets orbiting far from their stars; an exoplanet closer to its sun is usually obscured by the star\u2019s bright light, making it difficult to detect or image. (When they\u2019re farther away, there\u2019s greater contrast between the exoplanet\u2019s and the star\u2019s light.)</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Meanwhile, indirect imaging (precision astrometry) looks for stars that appear to \u201cwobble,\u201d meaning their gravity may be affected by an (otherwise unseen to us) exoplanet. This method can more easily detect the presence of planets orbiting closer to their stars \u2014 like the Earth\u2019s relationship to the Sun. As a result, indirect imaging has yielded over 5,000 exoplanet discoveries, while direct imaging has only captured about 20.</p><p>The international team of researchers, led by Thayne Currie of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ) and the University of Texas at San Antonio, combined the two methods to discover the new exoplanet. First, they used data from the Hipparcos-Gaia Catalogue of Accelerations \u2014 a map tracking the precise positions and motions of nearly two million stars in the Milky Way \u2014 to identify the star HIP 99770 as a prime candidate for hosting an exoplanet. Then, they used Japan\u2019s ultra-powerful <a href=\"https://subarutelescope.org/en/results/2023/04/13/3256.html\">Subaru telescope</a> (in Mauna Kea, Hawaii) to directly image the newly discovered exoplanet, creatively titled HIP 99770 b.</p><figure><img alt=\"ESA illustration of the newly discovered HIP 99770 b, orbiting the star HIP 99770.

Despite having an orbit over three times longer than Jupiter\u2019s orbit around our Sun, HIP 99770 b receives around the same amount of light as Jupiter because its sun is about twice as massive as ours. The researchers say it may have water and carbon monoxide in its atmosphere.</p><p>Astronomers believe the new method combining direct and indirect imaging opens an exciting new door for future discoveries. \u201cIt provides a new path forward to discovering more exoplanets, and characterizing them in a far more holistic way than we could do before,\u201d says Currie. Additionally, the group views Gaia\u2019s upcoming fourth data release, which will yield nearly double the previous version\u2019s data, will make it easier to identify stars wobbling from the gravity of planetary bodies. \u201cThe discovery of this planet will spawn dozens of follow-on studies.\u201d The team is now studying data from about 50 other stars showing promise for hosting exoplanets.</p><p>\u201cThis is sort of a test run for the kind of strategy we need to be able to image an earth,\u201d said Currie. \u201cIt demonstrates that an indirect method sensitive to a planet\u2019s gravitational pull can tell you where to look and exactly when to look for direct imaging. So I think that\u2019s really exciting.\u201d</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/researchers-use-novel-method-to-find-a-distant-exoplanet-175055335.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/researchers-use-novel-method-to-find-a-distant-exoplanet-175055335.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-14 17:50:55+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "\u2018The Super Mario Bros.

Scientists conducted tests in which they altered the genomes of skin-based microbes and bacteria to fight cancer. These altered microbes were swabbed onto cancer-stricken mice and, lo and behold, tumors began to dissipate.</p><p>The bacteria in question, Staphylococcus epidermidis, was grabbed from the fur of mice and altered to produce a protein that stimulates the immune system with regard to specific tumors. The experiment seemed to be a resounding success, with the modified bacteria killing aggressive types of metastatic skin cancer after being gently applied to the fur. The results were also achieved without any noticeable inflammation.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>\u201cIt seemed almost like magic,\u201d said Michael Fischbach, PhD, an associate professor of bioengineering at Stanford. \u201cThese mice had very aggressive tumors growing on their flank, and we gave them a gentle treatment where we simply took a swab of bacteria and rubbed it on the fur of their heads.\u201d</p><p>This is yet another foray into the misunderstood world of microbiomes and all of the bacteria that reside there. Gut biomes <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wyss-institute-living-cellular-therapeutic-device-175604690.html\">get all of the press these days</a>, but the skin also plays host to millions upon millions of bacteria, fungi and viruses, and the purpose of these entities is often unknown.</p><p>In this instance, scientists found that staph epidermidis cells trigger the production of immune cells called CD8 T cells. The researchers basically hijacked the S. epidermidis into producing CD8 T cells that target specific antigens. In this case, the antigens were related to skin cancer tumors. When the cells encountered a matching tumor, they began to rapidly reproduce and shrink the mass, or extinguish it entirely.</p><p>\u201cWatching those tumors disappear \u2014 especially at a site distant from where we applied the bacteria \u2014 was shocking,\u201d Fischbach said. \u201cIt took us a while to believe it was happening.\u201d</p><p>As with all burgeoning cancer treatments, there are some heavy caveats. First of all, these experiments are being conducted on mice. Humans and mice are biologically similar in many respects, but a great many treatments that work on mice are a dud with people. Stanford researchers have no idea if S. epidermidis triggers an immune response in humans, though our skin is littered with the stuff, so they may need to find a different microbe to alter. Also, this treatment is designed to treat skin cancer tumors and is applied topically. It remains to be seen if the benefits carry over to internal cancers.</p><div id=\"4405ce5a9c3b4f3abe51909383039504\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">This is a major breakthrough. <a href=\"https://t.co/CgVYcf3lRY\">https://t.co/CgVYcf3lRY</a></p>\u2014 MIT Technology Review (@techreview) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/techreview/status/1646878492070408192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 14, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>With that said, the Stanford team says they expect human trials to start within the next few years, though more testing is needed on both mice and other animals before going ahead with people.

That\u2019s because this often adds a whole lot more features than you might otherwise have. We suggest getting models with a companion app that will help you set up and monitor your sous vide temperature remotely. Bluetooth-only models work when you're within 30 to 40 feet of the cooker, while those with WiFi let you supervise your food from anywhere in your home, or as long as you're on the same network.

Rather than using a vacuum sealer to get rid of air, you would use the water displacement method: Immerse the bagged food in the water while partially unsealed, and water pressure will push the air through the opening. Once everything is mostly underwater, you can seal the bag and it'll stay submerged.</p><p>If it still floats, you can stick one or two spoons in the bag, and that will hopefully weigh things down. (J. Kenji Lopez-Alt from <em>Serious Eats</em> also suggests using <a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/how-to-keep-sous-vide-bags-submerged\">a large binder clip</a> attached to the bottom of the bag along with a heavy spoon.)

You could also consider a torch like the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9CZXJuem9tYXRpYy1UUzgwMDAtSW50ZW5zaXR5LVRyaWdnZXItU3RhcnQvZHAvQjAwMTlDUUw2MD90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby10MS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYmEyMGZiNzQtNDEwNi0zMGQ5LWFlOGQtMDQyZDI1YmRkYmRhIn0&amp;signature=AQAAATCfuaKhhXFJszPdEhaSyTybYQ5aI32rdQ5aft3LG4WF&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBernzomatic-TS8000-Intensity-Trigger-Start%2Fdp%2FB0019CQL60\">Bernzomatic TS8000</a>, and we've seen others use a <a href=\"http://www.bookeranddax.com/searzall\">Searzall</a> \u2014 but a cast iron skillet is far more affordable than either option.

Lopez-Alt likes having a pot lid organizer immersed in the container to help separate several submerged bags. If you want to make custard, yogurt or breakfast cups with your sous vide cooker, you should get yourself some mason jars too.</p><p>One more indispensable item worth considering: a trivet to rest your water vessel on so you don't destroy your countertop.</p><h2>Sous vide recipe resources</h2><p>Since affordable sous vide cookers have been in the market for a few years now, there\u2019s no shortage of recipes and guidelines online to help you figure out what to do with your newfangled kitchen gadget. The links below are some of our favorites, though bear in mind that a lot of this is based on personal taste. Your mileage may vary.</p><h3><a href=\"https://recipes.anovaculinary.com/\">Anova</a></h3><p>It only makes sense that the maker of one of the most popular sous vide machines also has a deep library of sous vide recipes. If you're ever at a loss as to what to make via sous vide, simply peek at this website, where you can search for recipes from professionals and amateurs alike.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/2016/01/first-thing-to-cook-with-sous-vide-immersion-circulator-essential-recipes.html\">Serious Eats</a></h3><p>We've mentioned it several times here already in this guide, but <em>Serious Eats</em> truly is a remarkably useful resource for all things sous vide. Its guide to <a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/2015/06/food-lab-complete-guide-to-sous-vide-steak.html\">sous vide steak</a> is a favorite among Engadget staffers, as is its take on slow-cooked <a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/2013/10/sous-vide-101-all-about-eggs.html\">sous-vide style eggs</a>, which results in some of the best eggs I've ever had.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.chefsteps.com/activities/a-map-of-sous-vide-cooking\">Chefsteps</a></h3><p>Years before making the Joule, Chefsteps made a name for itself as a cooking school with a heavy emphasis on food science, tech and molecular gastronomy. That's probably why the sous vide recipes from Chefsteps are some of the more creative ones we've seen. One recipe, for example, teaches you how to make that perfect <a href=\"https://www.chefsteps.com/activities/sous-vide-chicken-breast\">chicken breast</a> along with the perfect accompaniment for said chicken breast \u2014 perhaps a crunchy apple fennel salad and a buttery carrot puree. Other favorite recipes include wonderfully tender <a href=\"https://www.chefsteps.com/activities/sous-vide-salmon\">salmon filets</a>, juicy <a href=\"https://www.chefsteps.com/activities/sous-vide-pork-chop\">pork chops</a> and Chefsteps' own interpretation of the \"<a href=\"https://www.chefsteps.com/activities/your-favorite-sous-vide-egg-bites-at-home\">sous vide egg bites</a>\" you sometimes find in certain Starbucks shops.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0399578064/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=productpost2019text-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0399578064&amp;linkId=9e6cfbe4c687335959313ff40302df4f\">Sous Vide at Home</a></h3><p>This is actually a cookbook from the people behind the Nomiku WiFi sous vide machine (which has since been discontinued), but the recipes in it will work with any sous vide device.

Several <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-15-instant-pot-guide.html\">Instant Pots</a>, for example, offer such a feature. Unfortunately, however, they do not circulate the water like the aforementioned immersion circulators, and the temperatures aren\u2019t quite as precise (which is a definite downside if you need something cooked to a specific temperature). But if you don\u2019t really care about that, or you just want to dabble occasionally in sous vide, this might be a viable option.</p><p>If you\u2019re dead set on a multi-tasking appliance and you have the money to spend, consider the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=ce1fdbb0-87c7-4856-a25a-d4bfd4a8b910&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Anova+Culinary&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjZTFmZGJiMC04N2M3LTQ4NTYtYTI1YS1kNGJmZDRhOGI5MTAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9hbm92YWN1bGluYXJ5LmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0cy9hbm92YS1wcmVjaXNpb24tb3ZlbiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYmEyMGZiNzQtNDEwNi0zMGQ5LWFlOGQtMDQyZDI1YmRkYmRhIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAbifg_T1B9IiukNe_puFPGLj6K2bviPXDyvYIT9jmpcb&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fanovaculinary.com%2Fproducts%2Fanova-precision-oven\">Anova Precision Oven</a>. Thanks to its use of steam, you can indeed use it to cook foods via sous vide but <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/anova-precision-oven-review-133035865.html\">without the need for plastic bags</a>. It also uses a fan to circulate the moist air around the food and a probe thermometer helps keep foods at a precise temperature. And, of course, the Precision Oven can be used as a regular oven as well, and is great for baking breads and bagels. It is, however, quite expensive at $700 and takes up a lot of counter space.</p><p><em>Images: Will Lipman for Engadget (Anova / holiday light background)</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/smart-sous-vide-guide-151821790.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/smart-sous-vide-guide-151821790.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-14 15:18:21+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Spotify will shut down 'Heardle' on May 5th", "description": "<p>Spotify has some disappointing news for <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/heardle/\"><em>Heardle</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>fans: the company is shutting down the song-guessing game, which <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/spotify-is-buying-daily-music-trivia-game-heardle-165602642.html\">it bought last summer</a>. \u201cThanks for playing <em>Heardle</em>, but unfortunately we have to say goodbye,\u201d a message on <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=449e2503-c6b5-44c5-bdb8-b3045047b3e5&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Spotify&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0NDllMjUwMy1jNmI1LTQ0YzUtYmRiOC1iMzA0NTA0N2IzZTUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3BvdGlmeS5jb20vaGVhcmRsZS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImNlNTY1NGFhLWE5OTItNDEwZi1hOTkwLWMyODU0NWY1Y2IwMiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAacKPePEZRTszAW0ED8TTp1A34NhGiT7asqGOs4l3yDN&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.spotify.com%2Fheardle%2F\">the <em>Heardle </em>webpage reads</a>. \u201cFrom May 5th, <em>Heardle </em>will no longer be available.\u201d</p><p>Players who want to keep a record of their stats for posterity should take a screenshot, Spotify says.

In turn, it became one of the more prominent and successful <em>Wordle</em> clones. Third-party data suggests that <em>Heardle </em>reached a high of 69 million monthly visitors last March.</p><p>The makers of <em>Heardle </em>sold the game to Spotify in July. However, just before that deal was announced, <em>Heardle</em>'s monthly visitor numbers had seemingly dipped to 41 million, according to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/14/spotify-is-shutting-down-heardle-the-wordle-like-music-guessing-game-it-bought-last-year/?guccounter=1\"><em>TechCrunch</em></a>, suggesting that the game's popularity was already tapering off. In comparison, <em>The New York Times</em>, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wordle-nyt-new-york-times-sale-215510156.html\"><em>Wordle</em>'s owner</a>, says tens of millions of people are <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=60e97fc3-5759-41aa-a73b-6317bb989588&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=BBC&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2MGU5N2ZjMy01NzU5LTQxYWEtYTczYi02MzE3YmI5ODk1ODgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmJjLmNvbS9uZXdzL3VrLWVuZ2xhbmQtbG9uZG9uLTY0NjI3MjA2IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJjZTU2NTRhYS1hOTkyLTQxMGYtYTk5MC1jMjg1NDVmNWNiMDIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAeoCM3n88BE6vN-LUmJ52zgTw-w4wRPNbaXwyJ3CPsJ0&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fnews%2Fuk-england-london-64627206\">still playing that game</a> each week.</p><p>When it bought <em>Heardle</em>, Spotify said it saw the game as a music discovery tool. Whether a player successfully guessed each day's song based on the intro or not, they were provided with a link to hear the full track on Spotify. It may be the case that Spotify wasn't seeing a high level of clickthrough rates, so <em>Heardle</em> may ultimately not have helped much in terms of music discovery. Moreover, the game is said to have aped some music discovery functions that are also present in Spotify's app.</p><p>It's hard to imagine that Spotify's daily song choices helped matters. Along with many classic tracks, <em>Heardle </em>often featured music that didn't exactly light up the <em>Billboard </em>charts but instead went viral on TikTok. It seems that Spotify didn't quite strike the balance of using <em>Heardle </em>as a music discovery tool while also making each song recognizable enough for fans to identify and keep their streaks going.</p><p>In addition, some players were frustrated that <em>Heardle </em>kept going back to the same wells over and over by featuring several songs from one artist over a relatively short time. Within the space of five months last year, <em>Heardle</em> featured six Green Day tracks, despite there being thousands of well-known artists and hit songs to choose from. Far too many Imagine Dragons songs have popped up over the last few months too (one would have been more than enough).</p><p>Spotify reportedly didn't have a team dedicated to working on <em>Heardle</em>, so there won't be any layoffs as a result of the game's closure. It's hard to imagine that picking one song each day and maintaining <em>Heardle </em>would have taken a ton of work. Engadget has contacted Spotify for comment.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/spotify-will-shut-down-heardle-on-may-5th-151454849.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/spotify-will-shut-down-heardle-on-may-5th-151454849.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-14 15:14:54+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Microsoft hackathon project looked at putting Windows on Steam Deck", "description": "<p>You can technically <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/steam-deck-windows-drivers-available-194017822.html\">run Windows</a> on gaming handhelds like the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/steam-deck-review-small-hands-180026719.html\">Steam Deck</a>, but it's not really designed for small-screened devices and their specialized hardware. However, there's at least one person at Microsoft who would like to improve the situation. Developer and Reddit user AndrewMT has <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/12kjgkh/microsoft_is_experimenting_with_a_windows_gaming/jg3lsvm/\">confirmed</a> that a Walking Cat <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_h0x0d_/status/1646339289230483458\">video leak</a> represents a hackathon project meant to optimize Windows 11 for Steam Deck-style devices. The proposal from September would have not only improved driver support, but fine-tuned the interface and introduced tools to help you quickly launch and exit games regardless of which service they came from.</p><p>The project was spurred by the desire to use multiple non-Steam services (such as Xbox Game Pass and GOG) and Windows' support for game mods and trainers, AndrewMT says. He also <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/13/23681492/microsoft-windows-handheld-mode-gaming-xbox-steam-deck\">notes</a> that <em>The Verge</em> isn't right in suggesting that this is an ongoing initiative. The handheld Windows proposal &quot;didn't go much of anywhere,&quot; the developer explains. While Xbox head Phil Spencer offered contact with people who could help, they were occupied at the time. AndrewMT is hopeful the publicity will help pitch the idea a second time.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"0cae7e79b8394ed396505d3892dbb7d4\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"zxx\"><a href=\"https://t.co/OWiw0f2k2v\">https://t.co/OWiw0f2k2v</a><a href=\"https://t.co/RdSGMmhgBd\">pic.twitter.com/RdSGMmhgBd</a></p>\u2014 WalkingCat (@_h0x0d_) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_h0x0d_/status/1646339289230483458?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 13, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>Numerous gaming handhelds, including the new <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/asus-rog-ally-is-yet-another-steam-deck-competitor-204535105.html\">ASUS ROG Ally</a> as well as portables from <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ayaneo-2-review-specs-price-a-more-premium-and-pricier-take-on-the-steam-deck-143039617.html\">Ayaneo</a> and GPD, already run Windows out of the box.
