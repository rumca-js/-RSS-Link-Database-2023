## Saudi Arabia’s grand sportswashing campaign comes to finish off cricket’s current order | Geoff Lemon

<p>A lucrative T20 tournament is the country’s latest shameless attempt to forge a better reputation for itself – and it seemingly comes without care for the game itself </p><p>First the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia came for golf, and I did not speak out, because it’s for men named Chad who want to network while supporting the manufacturers of boat shoes. Then Saudi Arabia came for Newcastle United, and I did not speak out, because frankly it was Newcastle United. Actually, Saudi Arabia already had Formula One racing, but that was a natural fit between those who produce oil and the pastime that most conspicuously torches it. By the time they came for Cristiano Ronaldo he too seemed largely made of hydrocarbon polymer, though he is biodegrading faster.</p><p>Now Saudi Arabia is coming for cricket – just another step in the grandest sportswashing campaign in history. The country is an autocratic monarchy run on the fundamentalist principles of Wahhabist Islam. Laws of ‘guardianship’ mean that women cede control of their lives to male relatives. The legal system uses prison, torture or execution against political dissent and anyone outside proscribed sexual or gender norms. The Saudi-led war in Yemen killed hundreds of thousands. The engine driving all this is Saudi Aramco, the biggest oil company in the world, the single biggest driver of our climate crisis, source of over 4% of global carbon emissions since 1965. Its only plan for the future is to increase production.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/apr/22/saudi-arabias-grand-sportswashing-campaign-comes-to-finish-off-crickets-current-order">Continue reading...</a>

## Chet Baker: Blue Room review – gorgeous unreleased sessions by maestro of drowsy jazz

<p><strong>(Jazz Detective)</strong><br />On previously unheard 1979 recordings for Dutch radio, impulsive improvisations by the trumpeter-vocalist are expressed with his inimitable featherlight phrasing</p><p>In 1988, the Vogue photographer and occasional film-maker <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/may/30/filmandmusic1.filmandmusic47">Bruce Weber</a> made Let’s Get Lost, a lingeringly homoerotic but revealing documentary homage to “the white Miles”, jazz trumpeter Chet Baker. Like Clint Eastwood’s Charlie Parker biopic Bird and Bertrand Tavernier’s Round Midnight (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/nov/07/jazz-film">also released in the jazz-fashionable late 80s</a>), it was a serious film about the music itself, even if the movie business’s conviction that improvisational genius, addiction and mental turmoil were natural bedfellows wasn’t far away.</p><p>Baker’s life was tailor-made for that treacherous storyboard: a James Dean-like doomed youth and Charlie Parker sideman in the 1950s; the star of the era’s chamber-jazzy cool school movement whose heroin habit brought jail terms, domestic strife, a playing life of one-night stands and early death at 58. Yet through it all, Baker kept conjuring beautiful jazz, particularly in Europe. The previously unreleased Blue Room joins together two 1979 studio sessions for Dutch radio, with classy trios led by pianists Phil Markowitz and the late Frans Elsen. The Latin-swaying Beautiful Black Eyes introduces Baker’s inimitable trumpet sound, blown as if he’s barely exhaling, the phrasing a mix of drowsy musing and impulsive flurries that hardly jolt his hypnotically flatlining dynamics.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/21/chet-baker-blue-room-review-gorgeous-unreleased-sessions-by-maestro-of-drowsy-jazz">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Strike by Russian warplane on Russian city leaves crater 20 metres wide; China’s foreign minister says it wants peaceful resolution through dialogue and diplomacy</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/21/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-422-of-the-invasion">Russia-Ukraine war: day 422 at a glance</a></li></ul><p>Welcome back to our continuing live coverage of the war in Ukraine with me, Helen Sullivan.</p><p>Our top story this morning: A Russian warplane has accidentally fired a weapon into the city of Belgorod near <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a>, causing an explosion and damaging buildings, the Tass news agency cited the Russian defence ministry as saying.</p><p><strong>Ukraine’s future lies in Nato, the western military alliance’s chief said during his first visit to the country since Russia’s invasion 14 months ago.</strong> Jens Stoltenberg pledged continued military support for Ukraine, saying: “Nato stands with you today, tomorrow and for as long as it takes.” He invited the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to the Nato summit in Vilnius in July.</p><p><strong>Zelenskiy said Nato needed to invite Ukraine to become a member and give it a timeframe for accession.</strong> “There is not a single objective barrier to the political decision to invite Ukraine into the alliance,” he said. “And now, when most people in Nato countries and the majority of Ukrainians support Nato accession, is the time for the corresponding decisions.”</p><p><strong>Zelenskiy has asked Mexico for its support to organise a summit with Latin American countries</strong> to help end the Russian invasion. The appeal on Thursday follows comments by the Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who said in China last week that Washington should stop “encouraging” the war, and that the United States and the European Union “need to start talking about peace”.</p><p><strong>The US president, Joe Biden, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, signalled efforts Thursday to ease tensions</strong> in the wake of the French leader’s recent remarks on Taiwan and the European security relationship with Washington. Referring to Macron’s push for China to play a role in forging a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine, a statement from his office said: “China had a role to play in contributing, in the medium term, in ending the conflict in accordance with the principles and aims of the United Nations charter.” It also said: “The two heads of state agreed on the importance of continuing to engage Chinese authorities on this basis.”</p><p><strong>Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, will meet the UN secretary general, António Guterres, on Monday,</strong> according to Russia’s ambassador to the UN. The two last met at the G20 summit in Bali in November. According to ambassador Vassily Nebenzia, the Black Sea grain deal will be an item for the meeting on Monday.</p><p><strong>Denmark, together with the Netherlands, is to donate 14 Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine.</strong> Denmark’s acting defence minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, said they were not Danish tanks, but tanks “which are bought in collaboration with the Netherlands”. The foreign minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, described it as “a very significant contribution”.</p><p><strong>The admiral of Russia’s Pacific fleet has left his position after a check of its combat readiness.</strong> Admiral Sergei Avakyants <a href="https://www.svoboda.org/a/32371755.html">left his post</a> as commander as it was announced he will oversee a new centre for military sports training and “patriotic education”. Units from the Pacific fleet had been taking part in inspection exercises that were announced by the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, last week.</p><p><strong>The Financial Times has reported that a leaked US intelligence report shows that China refused a request from the Wagner mercenary group for weapons. </strong>Wagner’s request in early 2023 suggested “it had some confidence Beijing would be open to arming Moscow, going beyond other non-lethal forms of support for the military campaign provided by Chinese companies”, according to the FT.</p><p><strong>A group of Ukrainian servicemen have been accused of treason for giving away information during an unauthorised mission that enabled Russia to attack a military airfield, </strong>Ukraine’s SBU security agency said. The SBU announced in a statement that the servicemen had attempted, “without coordination with the relevant state authorities”, to seize a Russian plane last July after its pilot said he would defect.</p><p><strong>The US and other allies of Ukraine are considering an outright ban on most exports to Russia </strong>in an attempt to increase economic pressure on the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. The report by Bloomberg says discussions are under way ahead of the G7 leaders’ summit in May. It is thought that it will be followed by similar actions by EU member states.</p><p><strong>The US announced $325m in new military aid for Ukraine,</strong> including additional ammunition for high mobility artillery rocket systems (Himars), advanced missiles and anti-tank mines. It is the 36th security package since the war began in February 2022.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/apr/21/russia-ukraine-war-live-moscows-accidental-strike-on-belgorod-injures-two-china-says-it-is-not-inflaming-conflict">Continue reading...</a>

## Evil Dead Rise review – solid horror reboot brings the gore

<p>A well-made new chapter in Sam Raimi’s splatter series delivers some impressively nasty violence but fails to leave much of a lasting impression</p><p>There was a surprisingly straight face attached to 2013’s bracingly nasty <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/apr/18/evil-dead-review">Evil Dead</a> reboot, a surprise given both the knockabout humour of Sam Raimi’s original films and the genre landscape at the time. A visceral demonic body horror performed without a knowing wink and with a decent budget was not exactly run-of-the-mill back then and isn’t exactly commonplace now, despite the genre’s ever-increasing churn, and could explain why its robust box office performance didn’t immediately translate to more Evil outings.</p><p>A decade later at a time when dead franchises are coming back to life with more gusto than arguably ever before, Evil Dead Rise is an inevitable resurrection, following on from recent revivals of Scream, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/oct/07/hellraiser-review-remake-hulu">Hellraiser</a> and Halloween and before we see more of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jul/26/the-exorcist-new-trilogy-ellen-burstyn">The Exorcist</a>, <a href="https://movieweb.com/the-thing-reboot-is-moving-forward-teases-john-carpenter/">The Thing</a> and <a href="https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/friday-the-13th-prequel-series-crystal-lake-peacock-bryan-fuller-1235418509/">Friday the 13th</a>. Originally slated for an HBO Max premiere, it’s been wisely upgraded to a theatrical release, smart because of the genre’s consistent theatrical success and deserving because, unlike so many other straight-to-streaming productions, it looks and feels like a real movie. Irish writer-director Lee Cronin, whose debut, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/28/the-hole-in-the-ground-review-seana-kerslake-lee-cronin">The Hole in the Ground</a>, received polite acclaim back in 2019, has made an impressive leap to studio fare and while his film doesn’t have quite the horrifying impact of the last installment, it’s a solid stab.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/20/evil-dead-rise-review-solid-horror-reboot-brings-the-gore">Continue reading...</a>

## Ghosted review – dreadful big star action comedy deserves to be ignored

<p>Chris Evans and Ana de Armas make for a chemistry-free pairing in Apple’s catastrophically misfiring mockbuster</p><p>It’s easy to see the commercial allure of Apple’s pre-summer mockbuster Ghosted, the package: a snappy buzzword title, an idea from the Deadpool team later fleshed out by some Marvel writers, a big, sexy star pairing proved on screen twice before, an action-comedy-romance hybrid designed to appeal to the widest possible audience. One can only imagine the enthused high-fives that took place in some cold, pristine LA boardroom when it was given the green light. But it’s utterly impossible to see the appeal of Ghosted, the movie, a staggeringly, maddeningly atrocious heap of increasingly boneheaded decisions that will act as depressing documentation of just how rotten things got in the current oversaturated streaming landscape.</p><p>Ghosted is content dictated by algorithm at its absolute, industry-shaming worst, so carelessly and lifelessly cobbled together that we’re inclined to believe it’s the first film created entirely by AI. It’s almost avant-garde in its all-consuming awfulness, made with sheer contempt for the usual base staples one expects from a movie, head-shakingly shambolic on all fronts. It’s smug elevator pitch over plot – a guy gets ghosted by a woman who ends up being a secret agent – and while the early inevitable trailer scenes that take us to the end of this logline are bad enough they’re nowhere near as bad as what follows. Chris Evans plays Cole, a farmer slash history academic slash plant obsessive who meets Ana de Armas’s mysterious art curator Sadie one day at the farmers’ market. After some truly painful banter about plants, they decide to go on an impromptu date, the kind that cuts to them in an art gallery with her beaming “Oh my God, I love Monet!” or the pair next to the tower of Lincoln books and her noting “Sounds like you love Lincoln!”, crushingly bland meet-cute dialogue that removes us from their journey before it truly begins.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/20/ghosted-review-dreadful-action-comedy-chris-evans-ana-de-armas">Continue reading...</a>
