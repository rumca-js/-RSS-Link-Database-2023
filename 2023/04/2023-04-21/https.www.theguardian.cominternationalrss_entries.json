Yet through it all, Baker kept conjuring beautiful jazz, particularly in Europe. The previously unreleased Blue Room joins together two 1979 studio sessions for Dutch radio, with classy trios led by pianists Phil Markowitz and the late Frans Elsen. The Latin-swaying Beautiful Black Eyes introduces Baker\u2019s inimitable trumpet sound, blown as if he\u2019s barely exhaling, the phrasing a mix of drowsy musing and impulsive flurries that hardly jolt his hypnotically flatlining dynamics.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/21/chet-baker-blue-room-review-gorgeous-unreleased-sessions-by-maestro-of-drowsy-jazz\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/21/chet-baker-blue-room-review-gorgeous-unreleased-sessions-by-maestro-of-drowsy-jazz", "date_published": "2023-04-21 08:00:06+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "Sunak right to delay decision on Raab bullying report, senior minister says", "description": "<p>Transport secretary defends PM after he is criticised by senior Conservatives for \u2018dithering\u2019</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/apr/21/dominic-raab-bullying-report-rishi-sunak-tories-uk-politics-latest-news\">UK politics live \u2013 latest updates</a></li></ul><p>Rishi Sunak is right to delay the decision on the fate of Dominic Raab, a senior minister has said, as the prime minister pores over a lengthy report into allegations that his deputy bullied staff.</p><p>Mark Harper, the transport secretary, said on Friday morning Sunak was doing the right thing by waiting to make his mind up over whether Raab should resign over the allegations, a day after he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/apr/20/dominic-raab-fights-for-political-future-as-pm-ponders-stinging-bullying-report\">received the report from Adam Tolley KC</a>.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/apr/21/rishi-sunak-right-delay-decision-dominic-raab-bullying-claims-senior-minister-says\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/apr/21/rishi-sunak-right-delay-decision-dominic-raab-bullying-claims-senior-minister-says", "date_published": "2023-04-21 07:59:42+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/international/rss", "title": "Russia-Ukraine war live: Moscow\u2019s accidental strike on Belgorod injures two; China says it is \u2018not inflaming\u2019 conflict", "description": "<p>Strike by Russian warplane on Russian city leaves crater 20 metres wide; China\u2019s foreign minister says it wants peaceful resolution through dialogue and diplomacy</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/21/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-422-of-the-invasion\">Russia-Ukraine war: day 422 at a glance</a></li></ul><p>Welcome back to our continuing live coverage of the war in Ukraine with me, Helen Sullivan.</p><p>Our top story this morning: A Russian warplane has accidentally fired a weapon into the city of Belgorod near <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a>, causing an explosion and damaging buildings, the Tass news agency cited the Russian defence ministry as saying.</p><p><strong>Ukraine\u2019s future lies in Nato, the western military alliance\u2019s chief said during his first visit to the country since Russia\u2019s invasion 14 months ago.</strong> Jens Stoltenberg pledged continued military support for Ukraine, saying: \u201cNato stands with you today, tomorrow and for as long as it takes.\u201d He invited the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to the Nato summit in Vilnius in July.</p><p><strong>Zelenskiy said Nato needed to invite Ukraine to become a member and give it a timeframe for accession.</strong> \u201cThere is not a single objective barrier to the political decision to invite Ukraine into the alliance,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now, when most people in Nato countries and the majority of Ukrainians support Nato accession, is the time for the corresponding decisions.\u201d</p><p><strong>Zelenskiy has asked Mexico for its support to organise a summit with Latin American countries</strong> to help end the Russian invasion. The appeal on Thursday follows comments by the Brazilian president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who said in China last week that Washington should stop \u201cencouraging\u201d the war, and that the United States and the European Union \u201cneed to start talking about peace\u201d.</p><p><strong>The US president, Joe Biden, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, signalled efforts Thursday to ease tensions</strong> in the wake of the French leader\u2019s recent remarks on Taiwan and the European security relationship with Washington. Referring to Macron\u2019s push for China to play a role in forging a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine, a statement from his office said: \u201cChina had a role to play in contributing, in the medium term, in ending the conflict in accordance with the principles and aims of the United Nations charter.\u201d It also said: \u201cThe two heads of state agreed on the importance of continuing to engage Chinese authorities on this basis.\u201d</p><p><strong>Sergei Lavrov, Russia\u2019s foreign minister, will meet the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, on Monday,</strong> according to Russia\u2019s ambassador to the UN.
