  <p id="3TqOt8">Tesla has won a lawsuit that tried to blame the company’s Autopilot driver assist software for a 2019 crash, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-jury-set-decide-test-case-tesla-autopilot-crash-2023-04-21/"><em>Reuters</em> reports</a>. The jurors in the case found that the software wasn’t at fault in a crash where the car turned into a median on a city street while Autopilot was engaged. The jury awarded plaintiff Justine Hsu, who sued Tesla in 2020, no damages.</p>
<p id="Al8Tx7">The trial is believed to be the first regarding Autopilot, and could prove to be an important case if Tesla faces future lawsuits over the technology. While <em>Reuters</em> reports that the result of the trial “is not legally binding in other cases,” Tesla is under intense scrutiny for its Autopilot and its Full Self-Driving driver assistance features, which don’t make its cars fully autonomous...</p>

  <p id="IUyNmP">With iOS 16, Apple added <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/6/23151443/ios-16-notification-features-apple-wwdc">a feature called Live Activities</a> as part of a broader update to notifications and the lock screen. Live Activities are a little different from a standard push notification or widget — they offer a way for apps to put real-time information in a persistent notification bubble on your lock screen. They’re especially useful for sports scores if you want to keep tabs on a game without committing your full attention to it (there are, after all, 162 games in a baseball season). Better yet, if you have an iPhone 14 Pro or Pro Max, you’ll see live scores in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23341555/apple-iphone-14-pro-max-notch-dynamic-island-fix">the Dynamic Island</a> when you’re following a game.</p>

  <p id="4ykdTI">Back in early 2020, as the covid pandemic drove classrooms online, school districts found themselves needing to bulk purchase affordable laptops that they could send home with their students. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/30/22256873/chromebook-best-year-ever-double-yearly-sales">Quite a few</a> turned to Chromebooks. </p>
<p id="jQeg21">Three years later, the US Public Interest Research Group Education Fund concludes in a new report called <em>Chromebook Churn </em>that many of these batches are already beginning to break. That’s potentially costing districts money; PIRG estimates that “doubling the lifespan of Chromebooks could result in $1.8 billion in savings for taxpayers.” It also creates quite a bit of e-waste.</p>
<p id="avxedY">One of the big problems is repairability. Chromebooks are harder to upgrade and repair, on average, than Windows laptops. That’s in part,...</p>

  <p id="KOcnap">You’ve obviously heard of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22579493/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc">Steam Deck</a>, and perhaps Asus drew your attention to the upcoming ROG Ally <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/1/23666084/asus-rog-ally-handheld-windows-gaming-portable">with its not-an-April-Fools’-joke</a>.

<p id="RS6GTU">One of the reasons we got so excited about the Asus ROG Ally is that Asus hinted it might be the first handheld since Steam Deck to offer a custom part specifically tuned for portables — and a growing body of <a href="https://twitter.com/hifihedgehog/status/1648326604643246082">leaks</a> suggests that collaboration with AMD is called the Ryzen Z1. </p>

  <p id="qt7F2Q">Redbox wants to give Netflix’s DVD business a second chance at life, but Netflix isn’t budging. That’s <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/redbox-wants-buy-netflix-dvd-business-1235392145/">according to a report from <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a> (<a href="https://www.nexttv.com/news/redbox-owner-chicken-soup-makes-another-overture-to-netflix-for-its-sunsetting-dvd-rental-business">via <em>NextTV</em></a>), which says that Redbox’s parent company has already expressed interest in acquiring Netflix’s DVD business, only to get turned down by the streamer several times.</p>
<p id="dN9Voa">Bill Rouhana, the CEO of Chicken Soup for the Soul, which <a href="https://variety.com/2022/digital/news/redbox-deal-close-chicken-soup-for-the-soul-entertainment-1235338943/">acquired Redbox for $370 million last year</a>, tells <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> that Netflix has brushed off his attempts to purchase its DVD business “three or four times” before Netflix <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/18/23688543/netflix-dvd-com-business-25-years">announced its decision to sunset the offering on Tuesday</a>. “I’d like to buy it,” Rouhana says. “I wish Netflix would sell me that business instead of shutting it down.” </p>

  <p id="rr9hYa">For more than a decade, Snapchat has been a fixture in the lives of young people. But the business side of the app has been much less stable. This week I flew down to LA to check in on the company — and while Snap still has plenty of big ideas, I was struck by how much the company’s ambitions seem to be limited at the moment by the recent downturn in the economy.</p>
<p id="uRNTg4">The occasion for my visit was the annual <a href="https://www.snappartnersummit.com/">Snap Partner Summit</a>. For the past three years, due to the pandemic, the event had been online-only. But this year the company gathered together its business partners and the press together in person again, in a giant airplane hangar in Santa Monica.</p>

This can vary depending on your location or the specific feed that YouTube TV is serving you, but if you scan the YouTube TV subreddit, you’ll see picture quality as a common grievance.

  <p id="iFBArv">Twitter has removed the “government-funded” and “state-affiliated” labels that led several news outlets to stop tweeting on the platform. When asked why Twitter has dropped the labels, Elon Musk says it was a “suggestion” from Walter Isaacson, the author of his upcoming biography, <a href="https://twitter.com/BobbyAllyn/status/1649372906558717953?s=20">according to NPR reporter Bobby Allyn</a>.</p>

The National Weather Service uses it to share hurricane and tornado alerts. Firefighting agencies tweet updates about where a blaze is headed. It’s supposed to give people a heads-up so that they can take precautions to keep themselves safe.</p>

  <p id="CPewim">Computing storage manufacturer Seagate has agreed to pay a $300 million penalty imposed by the <a href="https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/documents/about-bis/newsroom/press-releases/3264-2023-04-19-bis-press-release-seagate-settlement/file">US Department of Commerce</a> (DOC) for shipping over $1.1 billion worth of hard disk drives to Huawei, violating export control restrictions. An investigation by Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) determined that Seagate shipped 7.4 million hard drives to Huawei between August 2020 and September 2021 without obtaining an export license, despite a rule introduced in August 2020 that restricts sales to the Chinese company.</p>
<p id="yaCcvj">The $300 million penalty is the largest fine ever imposed by the BIS that isn’t tied to a criminal case. The BIS says it’s more than double Seagate’s profits in selling the hard drives.</p>

<p id="k8xNdh">WhatsApp <a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/keep-in-chat-your-new-sender-superpower">describes the adjustment as a “sender superpower,”</a> and assuming it all works as designed, it still keeps the sender in control of what ultimately happens to the message.

  <p id="b7mIIe"><em>Dota 2</em>, one of the world’s most popular esports titles serving over 300,000 concurrent players on Steam <a href="https://steamcharts.com/">as I write these words</a>, has just dropped <a href="https://www.dota2.com/newfrontiers?v=2">a massive update called New Frontiers</a> that will likely change the free-to-play game forever. And the biggest difference by far is <em>real estate</em>: the game’s entire map is now 40 percent larger, letting you explore around the edges.</p>
<p id="4ZYICS">“The core objective of the game remains the same,” assures Valve — “your lanes aren’t further away from each other, and everything you need to win is still in the center of the map.”</p>
