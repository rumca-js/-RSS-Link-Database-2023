A new version of Combat Patrol for Warhammer 40,000 will be coming out this summer with the release of 10th edition - and it's important to the hobby.

Vince Venturella and I made another game! Check out Space Station Zero at http://www.spacestationzerogame.com

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
