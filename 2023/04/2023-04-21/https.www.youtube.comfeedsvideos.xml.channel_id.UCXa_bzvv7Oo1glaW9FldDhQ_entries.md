Trepang Studios’ upcoming Trepang 2 is one such game that we will be looking at today. Trepang 2 is shaping up to be one of the most brutal looking FPS games of recent memory, and the game features some interesting gameplay mechanics and design choices borrowed from popular PS2 era shooters with some of its own tricks that should hopefully result in an experience that’s equal parts fresh and nostalgic for long time fans of the genre. 

The game puts you in the shoes of a soldier who wakes up in a jail cell with no memory of his past life. And being the hot headed berserk that you are, you immediately take up arms and set out on a quest to exact revenge from who captured you in the first place and hopefully regain your memories in the process. As you can imagine, it’s an incredibly straightforward narrative setup with minimal characters and exposition - so it’s obviously best not to expect a deeply engrossing story with Trepang 2.
