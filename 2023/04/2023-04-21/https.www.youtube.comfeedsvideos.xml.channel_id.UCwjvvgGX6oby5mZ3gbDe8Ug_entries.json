The province is forcing central government to bail it out, but CCP has no more money.", "description": "#chinainsights \nWhat the Guizhou government did was very unusual. The rule of the Chinese Communist Party CCP officialdom has always been to report the good news but not the bad. The provincial research center, according to the usual procedure, should report to the provincial government first and then address the matter in private. However, what happened was before it officially reported to the central government, it posted an article publicly to expose its own scandal, saying that the province wasn\u2019t able to solve the problem and needed help from the top. \nSuch a move is like calling out directly to the Premier of the State Council of China, demanding financial assistance from the central government. It also serves as a public push to Zhongnanhai, where the central government is: Help me, or I will die!\n\nHave questions? Do you have something to share with us about China?
