Adam Sandler without question is a comedy icon.  Movies like Billy Madison, The Waterboy, Happy Gilmore, and The Wedding Singer put Sandler on the map.  Though as his career moved forward it became obvious that Adam Sandler was building every movie essentially off the same character type.  But audiences didn't care.  There have been some less than great Adam Sandler movies, but overall his roles in both comedy and dramatic movies have cemented him as an icon.
