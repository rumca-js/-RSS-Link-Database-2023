## Turtle Beach Stealth Pro Review - Phenomenal, With A Price To Match

<p dir="ltr">With the arrival of the Stealth Pro, Turtle Beach has once again cemented itself as a leader in the gaming headsets market. Yes, Turtle Beach has been one of the most recognizable names in the gaming audio space for nearly two decades, but as the field crowded with formidable competitors, Turtle Beach fell behind the pack in terms of quality. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stealth-Multiplatform-Wireless-Noise-Cancelling-Xbox-X/dp/B0BX77C1LD?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Turtle Beach's Stealth Pro</a> is not only the manufacturer's best headset ever, but also one of the best gaming headsets you can buy in 2023 across all platforms.</p><p dir="ltr">One glance at the sticker price will probably make you think: <em>Well, I would hope it's good for that price</em>. And <em>that </em>price happens to be $330. So, yeah, you're wearing a headset that costs more than the Xbox Series S or Nintendo Switch you're potentially playing on. The price is undoubtedly hard to stomach, and it puts the Stealth Pro in a niche but growing category of ultra-premium gaming headsets. Most flagship headsets nowadays retail in the $150-to-$200 price range--headsets like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-Platform-Headset/dp/B0B15QM5LL?tag=gamespot-promos-20">SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-BlackShark-Wireless-Gaming-Headset/dp/B08FQG96RP?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Razer BlackShark V2 Pro</a>. And for most players, those headsets offer more than enough in terms of performance, comfort, looks, and durability.</p><p dir="ltr">The Stealth Pro is a different beast; it's a headset that attempts to do for gaming audio what Sony and Bose did for studio headphones. And Turtle Beach isn't actually breaking new ground here. The Stealth Pro was obviously designed to compete with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Multi-System-Gaming-Headset/dp/B09ZWF9BCJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20">SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro</a>, a $350 gaming headset that was quite easily the best headset I've ever tried from basically the moment I started gaming with it.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/turtle-beach-stealth-pro-review-phenomenal-with-a-price-to-match/1100-6513476/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Dead Island 2 Skills - Best Skill Cards To Equip And Best Build

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dead-island-2/">Dead Island 2</a> uses a deep skill card system that allows you to further customize your Slayer character beyond their initial starting build. You'll unlock new skill cards early and often throughout the 15-hour story mode, but they won't all come in handy. Some are much better than others, including an early binary decision that, though it can be reversed, features a clear better and worse option. Here are the best skills to unlock in Dead Island 2.</p><h2>Dead Island 2's best skills</h2><p>The skill tree is broken into four categories: Abilities, Survivor, Slayer, and Numen. <strong>This guide will contain light spoilers</strong> as some late-game skills give away plot points, so just know that in advance. If that doesn't bother you, then continue onward. Even if you are spoiler-wary, you can still read about the best skills in the first two categories, Abilities and Survivor.</p><h3>Abilities</h3><h4>Dodge</h4><p>This one is very important, as you can only equip dodge <em>or </em>block. You can change them at will, but everyone on our team agreed: Dodge is superior.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-island-2-best-skill-cards-to-unlock-and-equip/1100-6513459/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>You can now dance dance away with your fingers using some tech wizardry plus crochet. <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kims_threads/video/7223949955126299909">TikTok creator kims_threads</a> (Via <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23692824/crochet-ddr-mat-tiktok-creation-tutorial">Polygon</a>) posted a tutorial explained how they made a functional DDR pad by crocheting yarn, weaving conductive thread in-between the crocheted pattern, and plugging the creation into the open-source software project Arduino. They then shows footage of them playing DDR with their fingers.</p><p>As Polygon points out, you could enlarge the project in theory by crocheting granny squares, making a cozy and customizable full-size DDR mat. Such a mat would need some extra work or a base mat to place under it so that it wouldn't slip around while you are trying to dance.</p><div><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@kims_threads/video/7223949955126299909" class="tiktok-embed"><section><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kims_threads?refer=embed">@kims_threads</a> I followed a tutorial by Andy Clark on Popsci.com but had to make lots of adjustments to suit my project.

## Here's The Deep Cut Power Rangers Character You Might Have Missed In New Special

<p>Fans watching Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Once And Always may have noticed the mention of J.J., Kat Hillard-Oliver's (Catherin Sutherland) son as she's teleported to the Command Center. It's a quick mention, but the last time J.J. was mentioned on air was five years ago during the 25th-anniversary episode "Dimensions in Danger" during the Super Ninja Steel season.</p><p>During that scene, it was Tommy Oliver (played by Power Rangers icon, the late Jason David Frank) telling his son to put away his bike. There was a voice off-screen that simply replied "Sorry, Dad." While we don't hear J.J. in Once And Always, Kat mentions that they don't have to tell her son what happened to her and his dad during the recent events to worry him. It's unknown at this point if J.J. knows his parents are Power Rangers, but one can assume it's hard to avoid coming to that conclusion.</p><p>The relationship between Kat and Tommy was hinted all the way back in Power Rangers Zeo with the two having to be "married" for a class project. Kat even borrowed a baby named Joey to give the project more realism. At this point, Kim (Original Pink Ranger Amy Jo Johnson) had already sent Tommy the infamous Dear John letter from Florida, where she met someone, ending their on-again-off-again relationship.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-the-deep-cut-power-rangers-character-you-might-have-missed-in-new-special/1100-6513473/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Based on the 2022 submarine horror game of the same name by David Szymanski, plot details remain tightly under wraps. Markiplier is directing and also serving as a producer on the project, along with Will Hyde and Jeff Guerrero. Caroline Rose Kaplan (The Plot Against America) will star opposite Markiplier.</p><p dir="ltr">Iron Lung takes place in a distant future, after the Quiet Rapture causes all habitable planets and stars in the universe to vanish, leaving only space stations and starships as remnants of known life. An expedition is sent to AT-5, a desolate moon with a blood ocean, to search for natural resources. The player, in a small submarine called "Iron Lung," confirms resource readings while encountering strange objects and facing challenges like decreasing oxygen, pressure damage, and fires.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/markiplier-takes-lead-role-directors-chair-in-iron-lung-horror-film-adaptation/1100-6513471/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Illumination and Nintendo's animated Super Mario Bros. Movie is almost assuredly going to cross the billion-dollar mark, and will probably spawn a sequel and spin-offs before it finishes its theatrical run. An interesting effect of the success of this movie is the original 1993 Super Mario Bros. live-action film getting a second life with a younger audience. </p><p>One of the original stars of the movie, John Leguizamo, has talked at length about his thoughts on the animated feature, calling it a missed opportunity to have a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/john-leguizamo-speaks-out-against-mario-movie-for-lack-of-diversity/1100-6509292/">minority casting</a>, and actually ended up <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-luigi-actor-john-leguizamo-is-boycotting-the-super-mario-bros-movie/1100-6513051/">boycotting the blockbuster</a>. In between those thoughts, he's talked about some very risque behind-the-scenes bits including the directors hiring real-life strippers.</p><p>"[The directors] had this dark, dark vision that Disney was not okay with so there was all this butt-heading that was incredible," Leguizamo told <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/john-leguizamo-1993-super-mario-movie-strippers-disney-angry-1235590797/">Variety</a>. "That party scene? Those were all strippers from North Carolina that they put on the set and they had them in the most revealing clothes and costumes."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/john-leguizamo-recalls-production-hiring-real-strippers-for-super-mario-bros-movie/1100-6513472/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Twitter Removes Checkmarks From Game Companies, And Fake Game Announcements Are Afoot
 - [https://www.gamespot.com/articles/twitter-removes-checkmarks-from-game-companies-and-fake-game-announcements-are-afoot/1100-6513468/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/twitter-removes-checkmarks-from-game-companies-and-fake-game-announcements-are-afoot/1100-6513468/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f)

<p dir="ltr">The world of game announcements has become a lot more confusing recently, as Twitter has removed the last of the "legacy checkmarks" that verified the identities of notable accounts. Since many game companies have decided not to pay the new monthly fee for the checkmark, this means that fake game announcements are more difficult to disprove--and we've already seen a few do the rounds.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">Trolls: “Are you the real Tony Hawk?”<br />me: yes, last I checked<br />Twitter: check again <a href="https://t.co/SvI7VepJ5W">pic.twitter.com/SvI7VepJ5W</a></p>  — Tony Hawk (@tonyhawk) <a href="https://twitter.com/tonyhawk/status/1649271795684614150?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">April 21, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">A fake <a href="https://twitter.com/bafeldman/status/1649198962958532608">announcement</a> for a remake of SSX Tricky was posted to Twitter yesterday by an account claiming to be a revival of EA Sports Big. Gaming figure Tony Hawk referenced the confusion in a viral tweet, joking that the people who often fail to recognize him may have even more trouble thanks to the change.</p><p dir="ltr">Twitter's new policy is that organizations must pay $1,000 a month for a gold "verified" checkmark. Many notable game companies no longer have the checkmark on Twitter, including PlayStation, Nvidia, AMD, and Nintendo of Europe. This is far from a gaming-only issue, as organizations like the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/new-york-times-says-it-wont-pay-twitter-verified-check-marks-2023-04-02/">New York Times</a> have stated that they will not pay the fee, as well as the <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/03/31/twitter-verification-white-house-biden-check-mark">White House</a>. As such, you should check any prospective gaming announcement carefully before you assume that it's accurate, as they're likely to surge in the coming weeks.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/twitter-removes-checkmarks-from-game-companies-and-fake-game-announcements-are-afoot/1100-6513468/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Xbox Game Clips Can No Longer Be Shared To Twitter Directly From Consoles

<p>Xbox has confirmed that sharing game clips directly from Xbox consoles and PCs (via the Windows Game Bar) to Twitter has been disabled, likely due to Twitter's API changes. While Microsoft hasn't offered a reason for why this function has been removed, it does come in the wake of a new Twitter policy that charges companies a starting fee of $42,000 per month for API access.</p><p>Microsoft is now advising that users make use of the Xbox mobile app to directly share clips on Twitter from their accounts. The Xbox DVR system has been fairly popular for sharing clips online since its inception, as it's relatively simple to tap a button and show off a noteworthy moment of gaming within seconds.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">We have had to disable the ability to share game uploads to Twitter directly from the console and Game Bar on Windows.

Now, two sets of updates are being planned for Lifeweaver--the first a control scheme rework, and the second a set of balance-related changes.</p><p>The control rework aims to make Lifeweaver feel a little less clunky to play, and will come into play next week. To cut down on clunky time spent swapping between Healing Blossom and Thorn Volley as primary weapons, Thorn Volley will now be Lifeweaver's alt fire. The auto-reload time on Thorn Volley will be slowed a bit to compensate for the change.</p><p>Petal Platform will be replacing Rejuvenating Dash as ability 1, and is cancellable with the same button. Rejuvenating Dash in turn will be changed over to Lifeweaver's double jump, similar to Hanzo's Lunge.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2s-lifeweaver-is-getting-a-control-rework-and-healing-buff-soon/1100-6513462/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
