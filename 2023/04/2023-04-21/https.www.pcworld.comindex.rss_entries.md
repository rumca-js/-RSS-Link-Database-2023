## Let’s compare Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1070, RTX 2070, 3070, and 4070

<p>Ever since the introduction of the GTX 470 more than a decade ago, the xx70 card has been something of a standard for PC gaming, the go-to tier of performance that won&rsquo;t wreck your budget for more than a month or so. But with graphics card prices climbing ever higher, is that still the case? PCWorld&rsquo;s Keith May took it upon himself to answer that question, testing and comparing the improvements in the last four generations of cards: the GTX 1070 (2016), RTX 2070 (2018), RTX 3070 (2020), and RTX 4070 (<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1781139/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">right freakin&rsquo; now</a>). </p>

</div></figure>



<p>Using some of our usual gaming benchmarks across four generations of cards reveals a fairly steady and predictable delta for performance, even in some older games without the benefit of more modern graphics optimization techniques. There are a few exceptions, like <em>Modern Warfare 2</em>, but generally you&rsquo;ll see the performance curve improve with each card. </p>

<p>But since jump from GTX to RTX, Nvidia has been boasting less tangible improvements like support for ray tracing and DLSS, and used some of those claims to justify the increases in pricing. Are they worth it? Running through <em>Cybeprunk&rsquo;s </em>benchmark on the RTX 2070, 3070, 4070, and 4070 with ray tracing and DLSS turned on, you can see a steady improvement in framerates thanks to these graphical shortcuts. The jump is even higher when you enable the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1662185/dlss-3-explained-how-nvidias-ai-infused-rtx-tech-turbocharges-pc-gaming.html">improved DLSS 3</a>, exclusive to the RTX 40 series. You can see similar jumps when enabling <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1782490/cyberpunk-2077-overdrive-mode-benchmarks-nvidia-rtx-path-tracing.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">the new Overdrive Mode with path tracing</a>. </p>



<p>And do these jumps in performance justify the relative increase in price? For reference, the GTX 1070 launched at a retail price of $380 in 2016, while a new RTX 4070 will run you $600 today. (The Zotac card used in this comparison is $670.) That&rsquo;s a massive jump, even accounting for inflation&hellip; but it&rsquo;s also the same price as the RTX 2070Founders Edition, after a brief drop last generation. Kieth concludes that the RTX 4070 is a predictable and justifiable improvement in performance, especially with the addition of DLSS 3, but it&rsquo;s nothing to get too excited about. </p>

## Blizzard’s Diablo IV beta is coming back for one more weekend

<p>Yesterday, Blizzard announced that <em>Diablo IV</em>&lsquo;s <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/23938755/help-us-gear-up-for-launch-during-the-diablo-iv-server-slam&amp;xcust=2-1-1794486-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">open beta is returning for one final weekend</a>, from May 12th to May 14th. This is exhilirating news and a sure fire way to ramp up excitement levels before the official June 6th release date. It also happens to fall on the same weekend that <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> launches. If you haven&rsquo;t already played the past couple of open betas, I can&rsquo;t recommend it enough. I&rsquo;m a longtime fan of this franchise and this particular game, from the top-down camera to the snappy combat, plays like <em>Diablo II</em>. Again, this is positively thrilling, as <em>Diablo II</em>, though it released 23 years ago, is arguably one of Blizzard&rsquo;s best games. </p>

</div></figure>



<p>Originally, the beta was only reserved for those who pre-ordered the game (hi). Blizzard then later opened up the beta for anyone to play and enjoy (which is the way it should&rsquo;ve been from the beginning). This beta will include rewards from the previous weekends, namely the wolf puppy backpack. Again, levels will cap at 20. Progress from previous weekends will not transfer over to the May beta, either. However, Blizzard will implement a few changes, namely <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/23938289/diablo-iv-open-beta-retrospective-transforming-feedback-into-change&amp;xcust=2-1-1794486-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">better dungeon layouts</a>, which will reduce the need to backtrack. Unfortunately, they&rsquo;ve nerfed Necromancers. That means your precious summoned minions will die more often. UI interface and monster encounter fixes will also be implemented in this beta.</p>



<p>If I learned anything from the previous beta weekends, it&rsquo;s to expect long queue times. If you&rsquo;re able to, I&rsquo;d recommend logging in as soon as the beta goes live at 9 a.m. PDT. <em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://diablo4.blizzard.com/en-us/&amp;xcust=2-1-1794486-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Diablo IV</a></em> officially releases on June 6th for the PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. The beta (aka the Server Slam) will become available on May 10th via download. </p>

## Proton Mail now includes an encrypted password manager

<p>Proton Mail is the email service for users who <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/411764/encrypted-email-service-protonmail-is-now-accessible-over-tor.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">value privacy and security</a>. You know what else needs to be both private and secure? Your collection of hundreds of login passwords, for everything from your favorite recipe site to your banking app. So, adding a password manager to Proton&rsquo;s offerings is kind of a no-brainer and here we are: <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://proton.me/blog/proton-pass-beta&amp;xcust=2-3-1794474-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Say hello to Proton Pass</a>. The beta service is available now for premium Proton Mail subscribers, but the company says that it&rsquo;ll eventually become free for everyone. </p>



<p>Proton Pass&rsquo;s <em>raison d&rsquo;etre </em>is the same as the email service: end-to-end encryption, implemented in such a way that even Proton itself can&rsquo;t see your personal information. This is achieved by encrypting absolutely everything&mdash;the password, login field, associated web address, additional notes, everything&mdash;and performing all cryptographic operations on local hardware, not servers. So, theoretically, even if Proton itself is compromised, your data can&rsquo;t be accessed. </p>



<p>The service is available now as a dedicated app for desktops and phones, plus browser extensions in Chrome and Brave, with support for Firefox and other browsers coming sometime soon. Proton Pass includes two-factor authentication and also randomly generates email aliases that can replace your real address, a trick borrowed from Proton&rsquo;s acquisition of SimpleLogin in 2022. Planned updates include an open-source release and bug bounty program as well as support for hardware security keys, which <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/20/23691097/proton-end-to-end-encrypted-password-manager-e2ee&amp;xcust=2-3-1794474-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The Verge notes</a> is missing at launch. </p>



<p>It&rsquo;s a particularly good time to launch a new password manager, as the fallout from the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1419901/lastpass-got-hacked-again-and-this-time-your-data-got-taken.html">highly public hack of LastPass</a> is shaking users&rsquo; faith in one of the market&rsquo;s biggest players. Just don&rsquo;t imagine that using a password manager alone fills out your data security checklist&mdash;especially if you&rsquo;re <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1656351/dont-use-autofill-on-your-password-manager-especially-if-its-bitwarden.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">still letting it auto-fill your passwords</a> into webpages. </p>

<p>Most mice unbox with something unique in the pack, like grips, stickers, or an extra adapter. But not many come with interchangeable micro switches and a little pair of tweezers as the Asus ROG Gladius III does. I must admit, it appeals to the tinkerer in me, the inner child that still gets excited by plaster dinosaur eggs and fancy DIY ship kits.</p>



<p>That said, this little bonus has a very practical application. The Gladius III sports Push-Fit Gen II Sockets compatible with either Asus 3-pin Mechanical Switches or 5-pin Omron Optical Switches so that you can customize its left and right main buttons. </p>



<p>That means if they&rsquo;re worn out, or just not to your liking, you can fix them up. My review unit came with two 3-pin mechanical switches rated for 70 million clicks already installed, with two additional red 3-pin mechanical switches provided in the box.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Further reading:</strong> See our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/452384/best-gaming-mice.html">best gaming mice</a> to learn about competing products.</p></blockquote>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Gladius III" class="wp-image-1681495" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Back.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>A hump rises from the back of the mouse to the base of the index finder.&nbsp;</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<h3 id="asus-rog-gladius-iii-design">Asus ROG Gladius III design</h3>



<p>Beyond the ingenious hot-swappable switches, the Gladius III is also beautifully shaped. Its right-handed design sports a high hump that rises from the back and peaks beneath your little finger. It reminds me of another superbly-shaped mouse, the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1663595/razer-deathadder-v3-pro-gaming-mouse-review.html">Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro</a>, which also raises your index finder for speedier clicking&mdash;it&rsquo;s a feature I rate very highly.</p>



<p>The Gladius III is also quite a large mouse&mdash;it measures 4.86 x 2.68 x 1.75 inches. To use a football analogy, that makes it more of an offensive lineman to the smaller running back-sized gaming mice like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1418294/roccat-burst-pro-air-wireless-gaming-mouse-review.html">Roccat Burst Pro Air</a>. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Being able to swap out micro switches for better actuation, click force, and feel is a big boon for competitive gamers&hellip; when the difference between winning or losing depends on a mouse&rsquo;s ability to respond.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>However, it still fits most medium-sized hands. Larger hands are themselves better catered to under the generous proportions. The mouse&rsquo;s high back also makes it best suited to palm and claw grippers, but it&rsquo;s by no means impossible for fingertip grippers to play with.</p>



<p>The Gladius III looks outstanding next to any gaming rig. It comes in just the one elegant black color, but has three funky Aura Sync RGB lighting zones. There&rsquo;s one in the mouse wheel, an ROG logo on the back end, and, my personal favorite, an RGB light zone on the left-hand side that illuminates five lines of laser-engraved text. </p>



<p>Despite this, the shiny plastic finish can occasionally show up oil from your hands, so you&rsquo;ll need a cloth handy if you want to maintain a flawless look.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Gladius III" class="wp-image-1681485" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Left-side.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>An Aura Sync RGB lighting zone illuminates five lines of text on the mouse&rsquo;s left-hand side.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>If you opt for the wired version like my review unit, you&rsquo;ll be tethered by a very smooth, shoelace-like ROG Paracord, which, although it gets a little tangled at times, seems to glide well over surfaces. There&rsquo;s a wireless version too, which has two connectivity options: 2.4GHz wireless and Bluetooth. This option weighs 81 grams, while the wired version weighs two grams lighter at 79 grams.</p>



<h3 id="how-does-the-asus-rog-gladius-iii-perform">How does the Asus ROG Gladius III perform?</h3>



<p>The Gladius III comes with a 19,000 DPI Optical Sensor which is tuneable up to 26,000 DPI using the Asus ROG software. Apart from that, it has a maximum speed of 400 IPS (inches per second), maximum acceleration of 50 G and pro-grade polling rate of 1,000Hz.</p>



<p>Flicking the curser around through the different DPI settings in games like <em>CounterStrike: Global Offensive </em>and <em>Insurgency</em>, proved that the sensor was steady and accurate at lower settings and super-quick and sensitive at the highest DPI setting. It also tracked beautifully without a hint of lag or stuttering.</p>

<p>At 79 grams, however, the Gladius III did feel a little too heavy for truly outstanding performance in FPS games. Wired mice tend to be much lighter today than they were previously&mdash;with some of the most recent releases even dipping below 65 grams. By comparison, the Gladius III did occasionally feel sluggish. In fact, I could hear my teeth grinding a little each time I overswung the mark on targets.</p>



<p>Still, it overswung so very infrequently that it never became a hassle. The Gladius III is still perfectly suitable for most casual and competitive play. I also really like the generous assortment of PTFE feet (and the spares in the box)&mdash;they made movement smooth and effortless over my neoprene mouse mat.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Gladius III" class="wp-image-1681487" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Underside.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The underside of the Asus ROG Gladius III</p>. </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>In regards to the buttons, I did encounter a small hiccup. For some reason the left main button, which in most competitive gaming mice is clicky and soft, felt a bit tight at first. To remedy that I swapped out the button&rsquo;s default micro switch for one of the spare mechanical 3-pin options, and that fixed the issue immediately. The right-hand button, on the other hand, felt perfectly balanced and clicky right off the bat.</p>



<p>On the upside, the Gladius III&rsquo;s buttons do feel exceptionally comfortable. They dip down slightly in the center keeping your fingers nice and snug and ensuring clicks always register in the middle rather than at the sides where you&rsquo;re more prone to slippage.</p>



<h3 id="asus-rog-gladius-iii-customization">Asus ROG Gladius III customization</h3>



<p>When it comes to button configuration, the Gladius III has a fairly typical FPS style setup, sporting two main clicks, two on the left-hand side, a single click in the mouse wheel, and a tiny DPI button behind it. On the underside, an oblong-shaped button toggles you through five onboard memory profiles.</p>



<p>All these buttons are configurable in Asus&rsquo;s Armoury Crate software app, where you can easily assign commands and macros via a helpful visual diagram. But there&rsquo;s a lot more on offer in Armoury Crate if you want to fine-tune your performance settings even further.</p>

<p>For example, you can change the polling rate, DPI resolution, and Aura Sync RGB lighting and effects. Additionally, you can calibrate the Gladius III for selected Asus ROG mouse mats, or manually to your own surfaces. If you&rsquo;re prone to lifting, you can also choose between high and low lift-off distances to reduce the chances lifting will affect your play&mdash;a luxury we don&rsquo;t always see in supporting software apps.</p>



<h3 id="asus-rog-gladius-iii-vs-razer-deathadder-v3-pro-vs-logitech-g-pro-x-superlight">Asus ROG Gladius III vs. Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro vs. Logitech G Pro X Superlight</h3>



<p>There&rsquo;s no denying that the Asus ROG Gladius III&rsquo;s 79-gram weight turns the clock back to 2021, when such a weight would have been status quo for pro-grade mice. But that was back then, and now in 2023 lighter rivals like the Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1475704/logitech-g-pro-x-superlight-wireless-gaming-mouse-review.html">Logitech G Pro X Superlight</a> really push the envelope on lightness, weighing just 63 grams. That fact makes this mouse a hard sell on weight alone. </p>



<p>Instead, gamers should consider the Gladius III on the balance of its other key features. The first is the hot-swappable switches; being able to swap out micro switches for better actuation, click force, and feel, is a big boon for competitive gamers&mdash;this one feature is worth its weight in gold when the difference between winning or losing depends on a mouse&rsquo;s ability to respond.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Gladius III" class="wp-image-1681482" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Inside.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The Gladius III features Push-Fit Gen 2 Sockets,  which allow you to hot-swap out the main buttons&rsquo; micro switches</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>But the Gladius III also has more up-front functionality in terms of the RGB lighting and the on-top positioning of the DPI button. Indeed, neither the V3 Pro nor Superlight have these two features, which makes the Gladius III arguably the more stylish, better to see in dark environments, and definitely the quickest of the three for switching DPI on-the-fly.</p>

<p>Finally, at its current price of just $89.99 it&rsquo;s the most affordable option. The V3 Pro by comparison costs $149.99 and the Superlight is more expensive still, currently wearing a $159.99 price tag on the Logitech G website. For gamers on a budget, this cost saving could make all the difference at online checkouts.</p>



<h3 id="is-the-asus-rog-gladius-iii-worth-it">Is the Asus ROG Gladius III worth it?</h3>



<p>The ROG Gladius III has a powerful sensor that&rsquo;s up to speed and a shapely design that provides you with a comfortable and performance-inducing fit. Yes, there are lighter and quicker options on the market for FPS gaming, but none I can think of that offer you anywhere near the level of button customization and up-front functionality as this one, or for a price so reasonable.</p>

<p>Folks, this deal is so hot, I singed my fingertips on it (not really). If you&rsquo;re looking to pick up a gaming keyboard and mouse combo on the cheap, you&rsquo;ve come to the correct place. Walmart&rsquo;s currently selling the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Wired-Gaming-Keyboard-Mouse-Combo-RGB-Backlit-Mechanical-Feel-W-Multimedia-Keys-Anti-ghosting-Spill-Resistant-Windows-PC-Gamers-Desktop-Computer-Lapt/1468383760&amp;xcust=2-1-1794303-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Shipadoo wired gaming keyboard and mouse combo for just $19.99</a>, which is a phenomenal value. It&rsquo;s kind of like a friendly starter pack for the beginner or casual gamer. Also, it&rsquo;s two peripherals for the price of one and you really can&rsquo;t go wrong with that. </p>



<p>The keyboard features 104 keys, RGB lighting, 12 multimedia keys, and a stair-up keycap design. The stair-up design helps keep your arms in a more natural position, which reduces wrist strain and hand fatigue. Although it&rsquo;s not a mechanical keyboard in the traditional sense, the keys have a &ldquo;mechanical feel&rdquo; to them. According to the manufacturer, the keyboard has a &ldquo;more tactile and &lsquo;clickly&rsquo; feel.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s also equipped to deal with accidental spills thanks to the drain hole design. Walmart reviewers claim that these peripherals work great and were easy to set up.</p>



<p>This is a fantastic value. Don&rsquo;t miss out.</p>

## Twitter’s check marks explained: What Blue, Gold, and Gray mean

<p>The saga of verified accounts on Twitter has reached its end. (Finally.) After months of beleaguered changes, the program that once identified notable accounts&mdash;like those held by journalists, major corporations, and public figures&mdash;has faded permanently into the past.</p>



<p>However, the blue check marks originally signifying verified status <em>aren&rsquo;t</em> disappearing. Instead their meaning is now different. Check marks of other colors have now joined the line-up, too.</p>



<p>You can boil the whole system down as a set of subscriber badges, with distinctions between each one. We&rsquo;ve explained them for you below, but be warned: Twitter has continually shifted its approach to check marks and how they&rsquo;re applied to accounts. What&rsquo;s current now might not be so in even just a couple of weeks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As for being sure a Twitter account is official, you&rsquo;ll now need to verify the account name (e.g., cross-check against an official website) on your own.</p>



<h2 id="blue-check-mark">Blue check mark</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Blue verified check mark on twitter" class="wp-image-1793311" height="695" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/twitter-verified-4.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>An example of the blue check mark on a Twitter account.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<p>Prior to Elon Musk&rsquo;s takeover of Twitter, a blue check mark meant an account was verified&mdash;that is, the person&rsquo;s identity had been confirmed. This distinction made it easier for people to trust that an account was truly held by a notable entity, like a business, government official, journalist, or other public figure or brand. These legacy verified accounts lost their badge on April 20.</p>



<p>Now that blue check mark signifies that the account is subscribed to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-blue&amp;xcust=2-1-1793292-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Twitter Blue</a>. For $8 per month via the web (or $11 per month via iOS and Android), eligible accounts get the badge plus extra features like reduced ads, the ability to edit tweets, longer tweets up to 10,000 characters, and text formatting. To be eligible, an account must be active within the last 30 days, have a display name, photo, and a confirmed phone number, and cannot impersonate another account or entity. (That last requirement is likely due to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1381758/dont-get-scammed-why-you-cant-trust-elon-musks-twitter-right-now.html">the chaos that unfolded</a> when Twitter Blue first gave check marks to subscribers immediately.)</p>



<h2 id="gold-check-mark">Gold check mark</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Twitter account showing a gold check mark" class="wp-image-1793314" height="691" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/twitter-verified-5.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>An example of a gold check mark on a Twitter account held by a business.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<p>Twitter is hurting for cash, and it wants subscription money from those who can really pay for it: businesses. Companies that participate in <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/verified-organizations&amp;xcust=2-1-1793292-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Twitter&rsquo;s Verified Organization</a> program get a yellow checkmark to indicate their participation, as well as a square avatar icon, Twitter Blue features, and the option to add affiliate accounts (i.e., individuals, divisions, or sub-brands affiliated with the organization).</p>



<p>Given the subscription cost&mdash;$1,000 per month in the U.S.&mdash;it&rsquo;s less likely that you&rsquo;ll encounter a false account for, say, a bank or other major institution, but not impossible. The terms and conditions of the program <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://legal.twitter.com/en/purchaser-terms.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1793292-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">don&rsquo;t describe</a> an actual verification process. Twitter no longer has a media relations team to field questions on this point, either.</p>



<h2 id="gray-check-mark">Gray check mark</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Twitter account showing gray check mark" class="wp-image-1793320" height="699" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/twitter-verified-6.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>An example of a gray check mark on a Twitter account held by a government agency.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<p>A variant of the Verified Organizations mark, this flavor of subscription badge signifies a government organization or official&mdash;or a multilateral institution like the United Nations.</p>



<p>Twitter previously used this icon to also identify media outlets, but that policy has now changed to identifying such organizations with a gold check mark. Labels further identifying media with ties to government remain, though <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/government-media-labels&amp;xcust=2-1-1793292-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">the company&rsquo;s definition includes orgs</a> that take any government funding, rather than only those under direct government control of editorial content. Rival Facebook follows <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.facebook.com/help/767411547028573&amp;xcust=2-1-1793292-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">the latter guideline</a>.</p>



<p>As a consequence, news outlets typically regarded as independent now show a gold check mark along with a label identifying them as government-funded. High-profile examples include <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://apnews.com/article/twitter-npr-state-affiliated-media-label-dea3e04905e423f7a8df9ba077d421f3&amp;xcust=2-1-1793292-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">NPR</a>, which chose to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://apnews.com/article/npr-quits-twitter-stateaffiliated-media-label-elon-musk-94afa8e82cdc4bfc784a70725c9a8839&amp;xcust=2-1-1793292-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">discontinue using Twitter</a> altogether, and the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://apnews.com/article/cbc-canada-twitter-pause-musk-government-funded-41bfb23aaea84c65c682f52fb5c3fd59&amp;xcust=2-1-1793292-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Canadian Broadcasting Company</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When the CBC explained its funding, Twitter adjusted the account&rsquo;s label as state-funded media to include the following detail:&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="CBC's special government-funded media label on Twitter" class="wp-image-1793323" height="588" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/twitter-verified-7.png" width="1024" /><figcaption>The number here is not based on straight math.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>

<p>If you&rsquo;re accustomed to longtime Windows creature comforts such as <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/549576/the-windows-11-taskbar-is-an-annoying-step-backward.html">the &ldquo;Never Combine&rdquo; taskbar</a>, upgrading to Windows 11 can be a big adjustment. Microsoft <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/828207/7-frustrating-windows-11-annoyances-how-to-fix-them.html">changed or eliminated a lot of those features</a> in pursuit more modern, streamlined interface, and in doing so made it harder for some of us to get work done.</p>



<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t have to be that way. With a free, open-source program called <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher/wiki&amp;xcust=2-3-1786965-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Explorer Patcher</a>, you can bring back many older features of Windows without missing out on Windows 11&rsquo;s benefits.

<p>Still on board? Let&rsquo;s walk through all the things Explorer Patcher can do.</p>



<h2 id="how-to-modify-the-windows-11-taskbar">How to modify the Windows 11 taskbar</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Explorer Patcher taskbar settings" class="wp-image-1786967" height="661" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/noncombinetaskbar.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>&ldquo;Never combine&rdquo; taskbar icons, it&rsquo;s nice to have you back.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>Right-click the taskbar after installing Explorer Patcher, and you&rsquo;ll see a new &ldquo;Properties&rdquo; option that brings you to the app&rsquo;s main menu.</p>



<p>Your first stop should be the &ldquo;Taskbar&rdquo; section. Set the Taskbar Style to &ldquo;Windows 10,&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ll see all kinds of options for modifying it. A few options of note:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Combine taskbar icons:</strong> Choose &ldquo;Never combine&rdquo; to bring back labels for each individual window.</li><li><strong>Primary taskbar location:</strong> Move the Windows 11 taskbar to the top or sides of the screen instead of the bottom.</li><li><strong>Taskbar icon size:</strong> Information density diehards can opt for smaller icons and labels here.</li><li><strong>Start button style:</strong> Explorer Patcher sets the angled Windows 10 icon as the default, but you can also switch back to the flat Windows 11-style icon.</li></ul>



<p>This section also has options for hiding the search and task view buttons, but these settings are also available in Windows 11 without any extra software.</p>



<h2 id="modify-windows-11s-clock-and-notification-panel">Modify Windows 11&rsquo;s clock and notification panel</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Explorer Patcher and Windows 7 clock" class="wp-image-1786968" height="886" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/win7clock.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Prefer the Windows 7 clock? Enable it here.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>As long as you&rsquo;re tweaking the Windows 11 task bar, take a minute to visit the &ldquo;System tray&rdquo; section in Explorer Patcher. You&rsquo;ll find some useful options here as well:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Show seconds in the clock:</strong> Self-explanatory.</li><li><strong>Control Center button:</strong> Explorer Patcher breaks out separate taskbar icons for Wi-Fi and sound, so you can hide the gear-shaped Control Center icon for these functions if you like.</li><li><strong>Clock:</strong> Choose either the Windows 10 or Windows 7 style, and you&rsquo;ll see only the calendar view instead of the full notifications panel when clicking on the time. (After doing this, consider minimizing the Windows 11 clock in the notification panel as well.)</li><li><strong>Network:</strong> Choose what happens when you click the Wi-Fi or ethernet icon.</li><li><strong>Sound and Battery:</strong> Switch between Windows 10 and Windows 7 menus for these icons.</li></ul>



<p>Note that you&rsquo;ll need to click &ldquo;Restart File Explorer&rdquo; in Explorer Patcher&rsquo;s menu to apply any settings that have an asterisk next to them. This will make the taskbar icons temporarily disappear and reappear, and will close any Explorer windows that are already open.</p>



<h2 id="modify-windows-11-file-explorer">Modify Windows 11 File Explorer</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Explorer Patcher and File Explorer settings" class="wp-image-1786969" height="757" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/explorerpatcherfileexplorer.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The Windows 7 control bar holds up surprisingly well.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>Explorer Patcher&rsquo;s &ldquo;File Explorer&rdquo; section is another big attraction, allowing you to eliminate some of Windows 11&rsquo;s more confounding design choices. Notable options in this menu:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Disable the Windows 11 context menu:</strong> Bring back the Windows 10-style menu, which gives quicker access to shell extensions and uses text instead of cryptic icons for things like copy and paste.</li><li><strong>Control Interface:</strong> Swap the Windows 11 ribbon for the Windows 10 version or the old Windows 7 command bar (which holds up surprisingly well).</li><li><strong>Register as shell extension:</strong> Required for settings have have ** next to them, including &ldquo;Shrink address bar height,&rdquo; &ldquo;Disable navigation bar,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hide search bar completely.&rdquo;</li></ul>



<h2 id="tweak-the-windows-11-start-menu">Tweak the Windows 11 Start menu</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Explorer Patcher Start menu settings" class="wp-image-1786970" height="717" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/win11norecs.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Hiding the &ldquo;Recommended&rdquo; section leaves more room for pinned apps.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>While Explorer Patcher doesn&rsquo;t offer the deep Start menu customization found in <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/549492/hands-on-stardocks-start11-largely-solves-the-sins-of-windows-11.html">Start11</a>, it does offer a few helpful options:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Start menu style:</strong> Bring back Windows 10&rsquo;s expandable Start menu, complete with tiles and zones. (Note that you can only add apps to this Start menu through File Explorer.)</li><li><strong>Disable the &ldquo;Recommended&rdquo; section:</strong> Adds two more rows for pinned apps in the Windows 11 Start menu by hiding the section for recent apps and documents.</li><li><strong>Open Start in All Apps by default:</strong> Jumps straight to the alphabetical app list when you click the Start button.</li></ul>



<h2 id="choose-your-windows-11-alt-tab-menu">Choose your Windows 11 Alt-Tab menu</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Explorer Patcher task view" class="wp-image-1786972" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/explorerpatchertaskview.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Explorer Patcher&rsquo;s &ldquo;Simple Window Switcher&rdquo; is deeply customizable.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>Explorer Patcher&rsquo;s other tentpole feature is its ability to customize the multitasking menu. Just head to the &ldquo;Window switcher&rdquo; section, and you&rsquo;ll see a single item with a handful of options in its drop-down menu:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Windows 11:</strong> A wide Alt-Tab menu with rounded window corners.</li><li><strong>Windows 10:</strong> A slightly more compact menu with not-as-rounded corners.</li><li><strong>Windows NT:</strong> A super compact menu with app icons only.</li><li><strong>Simple Window Switcher:</strong> A menu with customizable height, width, opacity, padding, and scroll wheel controls, plus an option to show the desktop.</li></ul>



<h2 id="more-explorer-patcher-options">More Explorer Patcher options</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="More options in Explorer Patcher" class="wp-image-1786974" height="683" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/explorerpatchermore.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /><figcaption>Not a fan of Windows 11&rsquo;s rounded corners? Not a problem.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>Beyond the options above, Explorer Patcher has a handful of other toggles that are worth considering, which you&rsquo;ll find in the appropriately-named &ldquo;Other&rdquo; tab:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Open clock flyout:</strong> Use Win+C to show the clock instead of Teams.</li><li><strong>Disable rounded corners:</strong> Brings back more of the Windows 10 aesthetic.</li><li><strong>Disable quadrants when snapping windows:</strong> This makes two-way split-screen much easier to invoke.</li></ul>



<h2 id="uninstalling-explorer-patcher">Uninstalling Explorer Patcher</h2>



<p>Explorer Patcher is easy to remove, as you&rsquo;ll find it inside Windows 11&rsquo;s app list. Just head to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Installed Apps, search for &ldquo;Explorer Patcher,&rdquo; then hit &ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo; and click the Uninstall button. Depending on which options you&rsquo;ve enabled, you may need to restart your PC to complete the removal, otherwise you&rsquo;ll merely see the taskbar disappear for a moment before reverting to its old self.</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re a veteran PC user struggling with Windows 11, however, chances are you won&rsquo;t want to go back after giving Explorer Patcher a try.</p>

</div>


<p>One of the things we love about <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1781139/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-review.html">Nvidia&rsquo;s GeForce RTX 4070 Founders Edition</a> graphics card is its diminutive size. Finally, after an RTX 40-series rollout exclusively composed of monstrous triple-slot beasts, a traditional two-slot design arrives! But what if you want the extreme cooling and ample extras a bigger graphics card provides? Enter the Zotac Gaming GeForce RTX 4070 Amp Airo.</p>



<p>Ostensibly a $699 offering (though we&rsquo;re seeing it going for $669 in some places <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1784253/where-to-buy-the-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070.html">RTX 4070s are sold</a>), Zotac delivers a lot more heavy metal in the 2.5-slot Amp Airo, enhanced by attractive RGB lighting you won&rsquo;t find in the Founders Edition. It also comes with a slight factory overclock. The tweaks help Zotac&rsquo;s 4070 flagship run cooler, quieter, faster, and <em>flashier</em> than Nvidia&rsquo;s homegrown model. Is it enough to justify the price increase?</p>



<p>Let&rsquo;s dig in.</p>



<h2 id="zotac-geforce-rtx-4070-amp-airo-specs-and-features">Zotac GeForce RTX 4070 Amp Airo specs and features</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>At its core, the Zotac Amp Airo revolves around the same &ldquo;GA104&rdquo; GPU all RTX 4070s are built upon (which itself is a cut-down version of the GA102 die found in the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444726/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-review.html">$800 GeForce RTX 4070 Ti</a>). Check out our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1781139/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-review.html">original RTX 4070 review</a> for the full details.</p>



<p>In a nutshell, Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX 4070 GPU delivers highly efficient, ultra-fast 1440p gaming and best-in-class ray tracing performance, bolstered by DLSS 3 Frame Generation and GeForce&rsquo;s arsenal of fantastic software features (like RTX Video Super Resolution and Nvidia Reflex). It mercifully comes with 12GB of fast GDDR6X memory, an improvement over the RTX 3070&rsquo;s 8GB of basic GDDR6, but Nvidia equipped it with a narrow 192-bit memory bus that limits its future potential at 4K resolution. Essentially, the RTX 4070 is an absolutely killer 1440p graphics card but don&rsquo;t buy it if you&rsquo;re looking to play at 4K long-term.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Zotac RTX 4070 Amp Airo" class="wp-image-1792042" height="732" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/side-angel.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Keith May/IDG</p></div>



<p>Zotac changed a few things up, however&mdash;namely, applying a factory overclock. The RTX 4070 Amp Airo is rated for 2,535MHz boost clock speeds, compared to the Founders Edition&rsquo;s 2,475MHz. That jolt, along with the flashy RGB lights, bump the rated power consumption to 215 watts, up from the Founders Edition&rsquo;s 200W. It uses the same 16-pin 12VHPWR connector as Nvidia&rsquo;s card, however, which connects to dual 8-pin power cables via an included adapter.</p>



<p>But the real reason to consider buying this particular graphics card is for its kitted-out custom cooling design. The Zotac Gaming GeForce RTX 4070 Amp Airo offers an excellent take on the GeForce RTX 4070. While it may be at the upper end of the RTX 4070 pricing segment, the Amp Airo certainly has the construction to back up the increase.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Zotac RTX 4070 Amp Airo" class="wp-image-1792044" height="732" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/isometric.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Keith May/IDG</p></div>



<p>Coming in at 2.5 slots, it&rsquo;s as big and bold as pricier RTX 40-series graphics cards, but because of the much lower power the 4070 operates at, this beefy beast runs ice cold and whisper quiet. The triple fans on the Icestorm 2.0 cooler allow Zotac&rsquo;s Amp Airo to reach core clocks of around 2,750MHz under gaming loads while maintaining a sub-65C temperature. Better yet, we couldn&rsquo;t capture the Amp Airo&rsquo;s noise levels because the Arctic Cooling Liquid Freezer 2 420mm cooler used in our testing rig made more noise than the graphics card.</p>



<p>Seriously. It&rsquo;s that quiet.</p>



<p>While the card is massive for this performance segment, it still has a sleek design that isn&rsquo;t too garish, and Zotac had the foresight to toss a tasteful GPU support stand in the box. Thankfully, the card is built rock solid, so sag should be minimal anyway&mdash;meaning the support bracket won&rsquo;t have to work too hard to keep the GPU nice and level. Still, we appreciate Zotac adding it.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Zotac RTX 4070 Amp Airo" class="wp-image-1792043" height="732" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/lit-up.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Keith May/IDG</p></div>



<p>And this is a card that will want to be shown off. When the RTX 4070 Amp Airo is powered on, the side of the card illuminates in a surprisingly tasteful array of colors. By default, it&rsquo;ll take you for a ride on rainbow road, but the RGB lighting can be configured with <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.zotac.com/page/firestorm&amp;xcust=2-1-1792027-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Zotac&rsquo;s FireStorm Utility</a> if you desire. Note, however, that this version of the Amp Airo lacks the dual BIOS switch found on pricier models.</p>



<p>With that out of the way, let&rsquo;s get to the benchmarks!</p>



<h2 id="our-test-system">Our test system</h2>



<p>Keith May tested the Zotac GeForce RTX 4070 Amp Airo on his testing system, which runs using the same core components as Brad&rsquo;s main PCWorld GPU testing rig. You can see Keith explain the components in his rig <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://youtu.be/00T15aL1pkA?t=102&amp;xcust=2-1-1792027-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">in video form here</a>, while <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1781139/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-review.html#toc-2">this link</a> details what&rsquo;s inside the main GPU rig. Keith provided numbers for the Zotac card; the comparison data was pulled from our just-updated database of GPUs using the main test rig.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Zotac RTX 4070 Amp Airo" class="wp-image-1792045" height="732" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/test-bench.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Keith May/IDG</p></div>



<h2 id="zotac-geforce-rtx-4070-amp-airo-performance-benchmarks">Zotac GeForce RTX 4070 Amp Airo performance benchmarks</h2>



<p>Since we already know how the standard RTX 4070 performs, we performed several tests to see how the Zotac RTX 4070 Amp Airo performs, using the standard testing methods outlined in detail in the second link above. We also included ray tracing and DLSS benchmarks after the standard rasterization tests.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ll let these benchmarks speak for themselves, merely setting the stage with some initial commentary. The Zotac Amp Airo&rsquo;s mild factory overclock and outrageous cooling solution helps it run about 5 percent faster on average than the RTX 4070 Founders Edition, though that jumps to 11 percent in <em>Total War: Troy</em>. Differences in memory timings between the two test rigs may account for some of that, however, but expect the Zotac to run slightly faster than the Founders Edition overall.</p>



<p>Again: This is a great, highly efficient 1440p graphics card with top-notch ray tracing and DLSS.</p>

<h2 id="zotac-geforce-rtx-4070-amp-airo-power-and-thermals">Zotac GeForce RTX 4070 Amp Airo power and thermals</h2>



<p>We test power draw by looping the&nbsp;<em>F1 22</em>&nbsp;benchmark at 4K for about 20 minutes after we&rsquo;ve benchmarked everything else (to warm up the GPU) and noting the highest reading on our Watts Up Pro meter, which measures the power consumption of our entire test system. The initial part of the race, where all competing cars are onscreen simultaneously, tends to be the most demanding portion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This isn&rsquo;t a worst-case test; this is a GPU-bound game running at a GPU-bound resolution to gauge performance when the graphics card is sweating hard. If you&rsquo;re playing a game that also hammers the CPU, you could see higher overall system power draws. Consider yourself warned.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Zotac RTX 4070 Amp Airo" class="wp-image-1792036" height="1200" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Airo-Power-Draw.png?w=961" width="961" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Keith May/IDG</p></div>



<p>As you can see, the RTX 4070 and Zotac&rsquo;s Amp Airo absolutely sips power while delivering knockout 1440p performance. Props to Nvidia for the efficiency it achieved with this GPU.</p>



<p>When it comes to cooling, the Amp Airo stayed below 65 degrees Celsius at all times. That&rsquo;s deeply impressive, but it&rsquo;s worth noting that the Founders Edition topped out at 67 degrees, so damned-good temperatures are a calling card for the 4070. Where Zotac adds its special sauce is in the noise levels: We couldn&rsquo;t even try to capture those because the CPU cooler in our testing rig was louder than the Amp Airo&rsquo;s fans. For all intents and purposes, this card is virtually silent&mdash;something the Founders Edition can&rsquo;t claim.</p>



<h2 id="should-you-buy-the-zotac-rtx-4070-amp-airo">Should you buy the Zotac RTX 4070 Amp Airo?</h2>



<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a highly efficient 1440p graphics card backed by a bevy of modern features, like DLSS 3 Frame Generation and best-in-class ray tracing, the RTX 4070 is worth considering. It&rsquo;s not a slam dunk recommendation given its high price, and you should look elsewhere for 4K gaming. We delve deeper into that breakdown in our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1781139/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-review.html#toc-6">original RTX 4070 review</a>.</p>



<p>But if you want a 4070 specifically, is the Zotac RTX 4070 Amp Airo worth buying? It depends on your desires.</p>

<p>Nvidia&rsquo;s RTX 4070 Founders Edition delivers essentially the same performance and power efficiency in a smaller two-slot design. Go that route if you&rsquo;re building a small form-factor PC. If you&rsquo;re rocking something more large and in charge, the beefier Zotac Amp Airo is worth considering. Its heft not only helps it perform a wee bit faster than the Founders Edition, but all that heavy metal also keeps this beast running ice-cold and utterly silent even when under the most strenuous gaming loads. Silent running is a massive quality-of-life upgrade that can&rsquo;t be understated. And hot damn, its rainbow LEDs look good.</p>



<p>The problem is that the RTX 4070 is already priced uncomfortably high for our tastes. Adding extra costs on top only exacerbates that. That said, you&rsquo;ll always pay a price premium for a slickly designed, well-engineered custom card like the Zotac Amp Airo. We&rsquo;re seeing it go for anywhere from <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.microcenter.com/product/665451/zotac-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-amp-airo-overclocked-triple-fan-12gb-gddr6x-pcie-40-graphics-card&amp;xcust=2-1-1792027-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">$669</a> to <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1761047-REG/zotac_zt_d40700f_10p_geforce_rtx_4070_amp.html?BI=21883&amp;KBID=28249" rel="nofollow">$699</a> depending on where you shop. If the whisper-quiet noise levels, slightly faster performance, eye-catching RGB lights, and frigid temperatures are worthwhile to you, go for it&mdash;though we&rsquo;d suggest going with one of the lower priced retailers if you can.</p>
