Shocking defending early on helped Carlos Alcaraz and Theo Walcott, who both finished superbly, put Saints two up before Gabriel Martinelli appeared to begin restoring the natural order.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/21/arsenal-southampton-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>England are sure to miss their captain’s influence and importance following her tournament-ending anterior cruciate ligament injury</p><p>Picking over the bones of what Leah Williamson’s anterior cruciate ligament injury means for England feels brutal. Cruel even. Because, in reality, none of it matters. Where Arsenal finish in the league and Champions League doesn’t matter, whether England win the World Cup doesn’t matter. In this moment all that does matter is that a 26-year-old footballer in her prime has had to let short-term dreams die to embark on a mentally and physically bruising journey.</p><p>“The noise around the situation is loud and I need some quiet to let it all sink in,” said Williamson on Instagram after the extent of her injury was announced. Yet, here I am, adding to the noise. Hopefully Williamson never sees this article, hopefully she is switched off from the outside world and being engulfed in the embrace of the tight unit of friends and family that mean more to her than anything else.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/21/williamsons-woe-could-be-difference-between-winning-the-world-cup-or-not">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Blades stand in way of Manchester City’s quest for treble and are ready to ‘attack the game’ in FA Cup semi-final</p><p>Last week George Baldock enjoyed watching Manchester City obliterate Bayern Munich courtesy of complimentary tickets from Erling Haaland, but he and his Sheffield United teammates travel to Wembley for Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final fully aware they cannot afford to hand the striker any freebies. Baldock went to the Etihad Stadium with the Blades midfielder Sander Berge, who is close with his Norway teammate and stayed with Haaland after the match. So it is good to have friends in high places? “Exactly, it’s who you know,” Baldock says, smiling. “He’s a monster, isn’t he? He is a goalscoring machine. Everything he touches at the minute seems to turn to gold.”</p><p>Baldock and his teammates stand in the way of City’s quest for the treble. Sheffield United’s manager, Paul Heckingbottom, presented a video analysis of Pep Guardiola’s side on Thursday and Friday, and his squad are under no illusions about the severity of the task. Baldock has studied clips of City’s wingers and forwards to prepare. “You owe it to yourself to give yourself the best possible opportunity to nullify them in the game,” he says. “With the quality of players like [Kevin] De Bruyne, sometimes they can put it in an area where it is impossible to defend. Some of the goals they score, it’s not because of bad defending but formidable attacking play. We’re not just going there to make up the numbers. We’ll go there to attack the game and try to have a go.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/21/sheffield-united-continue-to-excel-on-the-pitch-despite-unsettling-backdrop">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Yes, they are marketing tools – but cataloguing culture says much about the society we live in</p><p>Like it or not, pretty much everyone today lives in a world of lists. If the lists are not made for us, we compile them ourselves: places to go, things to do and to see. The Italian novelist Umberto Eco found this so interesting as to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/dec/12/umberto-eco-lists-book-review" title="">write a book</a> about it (he also mischievously nominated the telephone directory as the book he would like to be cast away with, on Radio 4’s <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0093p3y" title="">Desert Island Discs</a>.)</p><p>Mischief and triviality have always been part of the cultural role of lists, but they are also serious and revealing in all sorts of ways. “[N]othing seems simpler than making a list, but in fact it’s much more complicated than it seems: you always leave something out, you’re tempted to write etc, but the whole point of an inventory is not to write etc,” <a href="https://aphelis.net/simpler-making-list-georges-perec-1976/" title="">opined the Oulipian thinker Georges Perec</a>, in a 1976 essay.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/21/the-guardian-view-on-grantas-best-of-young-british-novelists-why-we-love-a-list">Continue reading...</a>

So said one senior business figure at the start of this week about the crisis engulfing the CBI. The prediction was accurate. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/apr/21/aviva-ends-cbi-membership-in-light-of-very-serious-allegations">Aviva, a big insurer, was first to resign from the lobby group on Friday morning</a>. Phoenix, a fellow FTSE 100 insurer, quickly followed. By mid-afternoon, it was hard to keep up.</p><p>Not all stances took the form of a straightforward Aviva-style resignation “with immediate effect”. Some involved a “suspension” or “pausing” of activities with the CBI, leaving the door open for a return. Even within the latter category, however, one could detect weakening loyalty. The big four auditing firm PwC said it saw value in an organisation that represented UK business, and the issues that mattered most to business as a whole – but did not say specifically that the organisation had to be the CBI.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/apr/21/cbi-members-quit-aviva-lobby-group">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Dr Phil Frampton</strong>, <strong>Kathryn Fletcher</strong> and <strong>Patricia Borlenghi</strong> respond to calls for the city and its two Premier League football clubs to remove ship emblems from their logos</p><p>Simon Hattenstone’s excellent piece questioning the retention of the “slave ship” emblem in Manchester’s coat of arms and the badges of the city’s two Premier League football clubs is a classic illustration of how institutional racism operates, with such organisations turning a blind eye to the racism from which they or their members flourished (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/19/abandon-ship-does-this-symbol-of-slavery-shame-manchester-and-its-football-clubs" title="">Abandon ship: does this symbol of slavery shame Manchester and its football clubs?, 19 April</a>).</p><p>Graham Stringer MP and the council say the ship is to celebrate “free trade”, notably a trade that principally benefited the wealthier classes in Manchester’s cotton towns. The area’s mill workers suffered terrible conditions and impoverishment, which is why they led the general strike movements in the 19th century. Meanwhile, it is recorded that terrible atrocities were carried out in the British colonies in the name of “free trade”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/21/slave-ship-is-not-a-fitting-symbol-for-manchester">Continue reading...</a>

On this evidence it is hard to see why. The setting is dramatic, the plot darkly compelling, the hero <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arminius">one of the great icons of German history</a> and the score contains occasional top-notch Handel. This new production, in the Royal Opera’s smaller downstairs theatre, brings <a href="https://www.roh.org.uk/tickets-and-events/arminio-by-jette-parker-artists-details">Arminio</a> back to Covent Garden, where it was premiered in 1737.</p><p>Staging and music are mostly in the hands of members of the Royal Opera’s Jette Parker Artists programme. Past projects of this kind have sometimes struggled to find their stride, but that can’t be said this time. There is impressively confident artistic smartness from the start in <a href="https://www.mathildadutillieulmcnicol.co.uk/">Mathilda du Tillieul McNicol</a>’s direction and Noemi Daboczi’s sets and costumes. They give the opera’s military and political settings contemporary zing without ripping up its classical roots. The set initially evokes a hospital ward, and the curtains move back and forth to keep the narrative pace admirably brisk, which is not easy in Handel.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/21/arminio-review-handel-linbury-royal-opera-house">Continue reading...</a>

Ralph had set out to pick up his younger siblings at a nearby house with a similar address: he’d made a mistake, for which he is now fighting for his life. Meanwhile, 84-year-old Andrew Lester has entered a plea of not guilty on a charge of first-degree assault.

Sign up now!</a></p><p>With the possible exception of overtaking Roy Keane and gleefully unfurling your middle finger a split-second before realising it’s him, nothing in football tests nerve and moral fibre quite like a tough away fixture. Manchester United’s results against the top nine in the Premier League this season make for a grisly character reference: 0-4, 3-6, 1-3, 2-3, 0-7, 0-2. (Yes, sure, they won 2-1 away to 10th-placed Fulham, but that’s got nothing to do with the narrative we’re peddling here.) Six games, six defeats, 25 goals conceded and a general acceptance that United can’t handle football’s hotter kitchens. On Thursday night in Seville, they gave the most emphatic response to such slurs by folding just as miserably against the 13th-best team in Spain!</p><p>Corsham Town, of the Hellenic Premier League, have been forced to play nine games in 21 days to complete their fixtures. An amazing FA Vase run to the semi-final has meant an impossible end-of-season promotion push: three games a week in the last three weeks, with the last five games in nine days. Why not an extension to the season? It’s happened before. Has anyone else got similar stories?” – Mike Smith [we’ll point you the way of <a href="https://www.sandhursttownfc1910.com/">Sandhurst Town</a> – Football Daily Ed].</p><p>As a West Ham supporter, I hope Chelsea’s radical strategy of appointing whoever was in charge four gaffers ago doesn’t catch on” – Steve Butler.</p><p>Just catching up on Wednesday’s Football Daily (full email edition) and the piece about UCLA developing a robot that can kick a ball while withstanding shoves.

<p>The film How to Blow Up a Pipeline makes a case for using sabotage, but hope remains that we can build rather than destroy</p><p>The new film <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/20/how-to-blow-up-a-pipeline-review-explosively-tarantino-esque-eco-thriller">How to Blow Up a Pipeline</a> raises loudly the question that many protesters are asking quietly: what happens when peaceful climate protest fails? In its sympathetic depiction of a group of climate activists who set out to blow up a huge oil pipeline with homemade explosives, it gives the same answer in fiction that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/18/moral-case-destroying-fossil-fuel-infrastructure">Andreas Malm</a>’s 2021 <a href="https://www.versobooks.com/en-gb/products/2649-how-to-blow-up-a-pipeline">book</a> of the same name gave in nonfiction: sabotage.</p><p>Its UK release could hardly be more timely. As thousands prepare to gather for Extinction Rebellion’s new wave of peaceful protests <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/apr/19/extinction-rebellion-pledges-to-help-guard-london-marathon-from-protests">this weekend</a>, there is a sense of desperation in the air. So much has already been tried – so many marches and choirs, sit-downs and stunts, assemblies and pickets. Yes, we will gather again. Yes, we will paint more placards. Yes, we will sing more songs.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/21/climate-despair-violence-film-how-to-blow-up-a-pipeline">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Paparazzi pictures of Jack Nicholson, Gene Hackman and Bridget Fonda have circulated online, feeding into an odd desire to force reclusive actors back into the spotlight</p><p>Few headlines get people clicking like “OMG, you won’t BELIEVE how UNRECOGNISABLE this star looks today”. People fall for it every time. They fall for it when the star has succumbed to the natural ageing process (Steve Perry from Journey, seen this week with grey hair). They fall for it when the star is wearing movie prosthetics on set (Colin Farrell filming as the Penguin, the iconic character he played in a highly successful film). They even fall for it when the star has simply chosen to accessorise (“Australian actress looks unrecognisable in a pair of quirky sunglasses during a stroll through London – can you identify the star?” above some photos of Cate Blanchett looking exactly like Cate Blanchett). It’s a cheap trick, basically.</p><p>But over the last few weeks, these headlines have taken on a grottier note. A month ago, photographs of Gene Hackman, a 93-year-old man who retired from acting almost two decades ago, emerged online. Shortly after that, someone snapped a picture of Jack Nicholson – an octogenarian actor who retired 12 years ago, hasn’t been seen for 18 months and reportedly suffers from dementia – standing on the balcony of his home. And then, this week, the same thing happened to Bridget Fonda. She’s 59, she hasn’t acted in 20 years, and yet the sight of her visiting a landscaping supply store got the whole world fizzing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/21/hollywood-actors-privacy-paparazzi-trend">Continue reading...</a>

It was everything I did off stage.” Watson was the most striking British ballet dancer of his generation; he performed with the Royal Ballet for 27 years before retiring in 2021.</p><p>In among a hectic schedule of principal roles, there was a parallel life of photoshoots for magazines, fashion features, book projects and backstage shots. Now, 200 of those images have been gathered in a book, Ed Watson: A Different Dance, one that Watson insists isn’t really about him.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/apr/21/edward-watson-a-different-dance-royal-ballet-interview">Continue reading...</a>

## Need a top-flight spring jacket? Zip out and get a bomber | Jess Cartner-Morley

<p>A combination of Top Gun glamour and off-duty Hailey Bieber, the bomber is a jacket for all occasions</p><p>Spring is an excellent season. Spring is lilac wisteria and chocolate eggs and bank holiday Mondays. It is respite from worrying about heating bills, and booking a pedicure on payday instead. We get to crack open a window and let the light in after months of hibernation.<br /><br />Spring is the absolute magical fluffy best in every way except one, which is the crucial matter of what on earth to wear. Every other season is pretty straightforward. Winter is puffy coats and colourful gloves, summer is cotton dresses and sandals and autumn is knitwear and shiny boots.</p><p>But spring? Spring is putting all your coats away and then getting caught in a downpour in a cardigan. It is going sockless in a pair of loafers and then catching sight of your anaemic-looking ankles and ricocheting back to tights.<br /><br />If only there was a perfect spring jacket, one that would keep the last blasts of chilly air at bay while looking ahead to the sunny horizon. Well, I think I have found it. The bomber jacket is the perfect spring jacket.<br /><br />Well, no, you are thinking, because why would I want to look like a getaway driver in a dodgy action movie? Think again, sunshine. The bomber jacket is not that guy any more. It is what you might wear if you were engaged in some ultimately zeitgeist-ish lifestyle. Like, I don’t know, opening an artisanal sourdough bakery in Copenhagen.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/apr/21/need-a-top-flight-jacket-for-spring-go-for-the-bomber">Continue reading...</a>

<p>What sort of changes are being made by the brands who have earned the B Corp badge of social responsibility, and why should we buy from them?</p><p>Maybe it’s the “corp” bit of B Corp, but my initial reaction on hearing about this on-trend certification scheme was that it sounds like one of those often tokenistic corporate responsibility sections you see in annual reports. But there are now more than 1,000 certified <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2020/jan/04/guardian-b-corp-status-julie-richards-climate">businesses</a> in the UK, including several drinks companies such as <a href="https://www.innocentdrinks.co.uk/">Innocent</a> and <a href="https://sipsmith.com/">Sipsmith</a> gin.</p><p>To become a <a href="https://bcorporation.uk/">B Corp-registered company</a>, you have to tick a lot of boxes. The certification covers the way you treat your staff and the social and environmental impact of the way you run your business, and also requires you to be transparent about it. This is obviously designed to reassure consumers thatthey’re buying from a company that trades ethically, but there are significant business advantages, too: “People applying for jobs now look for it,” says Philip Everett-Lyons of <a href="https://www.hattiers.com/">Hattiers rum</a>, “and retail buyers are more interested.

Emery is staring into his laptop, right hand clasped to a wireless mouse. It is a snapshot that chimes with the workaholic and obsessive coach known to regularly rack up 16-hour days. Emery often cuts his own clips of games to review with players individually and sometimes watches back Villa’s matches as many as five times to prepare feedback for his staff and squad.</p><p>It is easy to forget that Villa were outside the Premier League relegation zone only on goals scored when Emery’s predecessor, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/oct/20/steven-gerrard-leaves-aston-villa-after-disappointing-start-to-season">Steven Gerrard, was sacked</a> at the end of October. Villa have won 12 of 18 league matches under Emery and would be third if the season had started the day the Spaniard <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/06/aston-villa-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report">outfoxed Erik ten Hag</a> in his first game. There was much promise against Manchester United but nobody predicted the remarkable turnaround that has put Villa firmly in the hunt for the top six and led Emery to dilute discourse about qualifying for the Champions League. A top-10 finish for the first time since 2010-11, the last season they played in Europe, looks likely.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/21/how-unai-emery-has-transformed-aston-villa">Continue reading...</a>

## Bannau Brycheiniog: is this Welsh national park where Tory culture warriors will meet their Waterloo? | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett

<p>Restoring the Brecon Beacons’ original name is not part of a ‘woke’ agenda. It’s just Welsh people, speaking Welsh in Wales</p><p>There’s a tired <a href="https://nation.cymru/opinion/welsh-speakers-switch-english-walk-into-pub/">old trope</a> that some visitors to Wales invoke when they reflect on having walked into a pub or bar: “Immediately,” they say, “everyone started speaking Welsh.” This is taken as an affront, an act of rudeness, exclusion or even aggression. Never is it considered that the Welsh clientele may have been simply speaking their own language in their own country anyway, despite the fact that if you transpose the scenario to most other world nations it ceases to make any sense.</p><p>I was thinking about this during the furore about the Brecon Beacons national park reverting to its indigenous name of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/17/brecon-beacons-relaunches-with-welsh-name-bannau-brycheiniog-as-picture-of-hope-for-future">Bannau Brycheiniog</a>.

## Follow the money: the story of slavery and Shakespeare’s First Folio

<p>As we reckon with the UK’s colonial past, we need to examine the history behind valuable books – even our beloved Shakespeare</p><p>Two stories, usually seen as disconnected, unfold themselves during the second half of the 18th century. The first is the increased dominance of Britain in the transatlantic slave trade. According to estimates from the <a href="https://slavevoyages.org/">Slave Voyages database</a>, the number of enslaved people carried by British ships more than doubled, from around 410,000 in the first quarter of the century to more than 830,000 in the third. The second is the establishment of William Shakespeare as the national bard. As scholar Gary Taylor puts it, “Shakespeare’s coronation as the King of English poets” dates from the third quarter of the 18th century, boosted by the actor David Garrick’s lavish Shakespeare Jubilee celebrations in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1769.</p><p>These stories have their meeting point in one specific object: the valuable book known as Shakespeare’s First Folio, published 400 years ago in 1623. And the history of this book also contributes to ongoing debates about what happened to the vast profits made from the trade and exploitation of enslaved peoples in the late 18th century and beyond.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/21/slavery-and-shakespeares-first-folio">Continue reading...</a>

Watkins sees less of the ball – his touches per 90 minutes have dropped from 34.5 to 27.6 – but he has more of an impact when he does receive possession. Crucially, he is touching the ball more often inside the box, up from 4.8 per 90 minutes to 5.7, and he is scoring a lot more goals.</p><p>It was an uncharacteristic performance from us. We have been so consistent home and away.</p><p>The only process I know it to analyse, reflect, go to work and then put it right. Training has been very good, the attitude of players has been very good. There has been no fallout from the game and no energy lost.

## ‘Muted, soft, like watercolours’: The Last Guardian’s soundtrack was an appeal to the heart

<p>Composer Takeshi Furukawa talks about creating the soundtrack for Fumito Ueda’s touching tale about the relationship between human and beast</p><p>From the opening moments of The Last Guardian, developer Japan Studio and legendary game director Fumito Ueda need you to understand one simple thing: this game is about empathy. Before you are given the opportunity to learn anything about its gorgeous, ruined world, you must heal the broken creature you find in your cell. Taking in its cropped horns and the spears jammed into its back, you know something is wrong. This creature, Trico … it is feral, it is feared. And yet, you must care for it. You know that, immediately. Anyone who has ever had a troubled pet will know how it feels to pursue compassion through fear, demonstrate love despite frustration.</p><p>“I believe the reason Ueda-san’s games are so successful in establishing a bond, whether it be with a girl in Ico, or a horse in Shadow of the Colossus, is because he lets those moments play out without music,” says composer Takeshi Furukawa, who penned the score for The Last Guardian. It’s odd to hear a composer praise the space in between the notes, but it makes sense when you listen to the game, because for the most part, the score is notably absent. It says more with silence than it does with anything else.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/apr/21/the-last-guardian-soundtrack-takeshi-furukawa-interview">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(Anti-)</strong><br />Warm, subtle jazz rubs shoulders with hip-hop and R&amp;B in an evocative album that hits the sweet spot between accessible and experimental</p><p>On Borderline, the second track on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/nov/08/the-beat-goes-on-the-new-british-jazz-messengers">Alfa Mist</a>’s fifth album, the multi-instrumentalist and MC succinctly decries the unfair assumptions, oppressive limitations and relentless hardship faced by Black British youth. “Everyday trauma, normalised – three options: music, sport or crime,” he raps in his understated, deadpan flow over an ambling beat and soporifically twinkly synths that bely his lyrical scorn.</p><p>After shelving ambitions to be a footballer, the east Londoner born Alfa Sekitoleko embraced the first option – yet his music is a world away from the cold, abrasive grime and drill stereotypically associated with such an escape from poverty in the capital. Instead, Variables is a collection of warm, subtle and often delicately beautiful jazz and hip-hop. It’s also largely instrumental: Mist’s vocals only appear on two songs – Borderline and the trippy, cello-adorned 4th Feb (Stay Awake). Elsewhere, Kaya Thomas-Dyke brings honeyed tones to the densely textured R&amp;B of Aged Eyes, while South African folk singer Bongeziwe Mabandla leads the exquisite Apho.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/21/alfa-mist-variables-review-his-own-universe-of-genre-transcending-music">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There is a seemingly limitless supply of reactionary politics on offer today. But it looks increasingly out of step with reality</p><p>If you’re a social conservative in Britain, these are the best of times and the worst of times. They are the worst because, as the rightwing press warns daily, liberal and other subversive values are spreading: in universities, cultural bodies, local councils, corporate boardrooms and big cities. Even private schools, previously assumed to be a reliable conservative production line, are showing signs of malfunction. “The hard-left’s woke private school revolution is here to stay,” <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/columnists/2022/04/20/hard-lefts-woke-private-school-revolution-stay/">despaired the Telegraph</a> last year. “Private schools have started eagerly introducing their pupils to all the hottest new progressive ideas.”</p><p>Yet while social conservatism appears to be under threat in many institutions, in politics it seems more influential than ever. On complex issues such as crime, immigration, patriotism and the value of work, family and the monarchy, Labour and the Tories compete to offer the most traditionalist stances and policies, presented in a ritualised language calculated to appeal to socially conservative voters: “crackdowns”, “security”, “stability”, “respect”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/21/britain-socially-liberal-politicians-conservative-politics">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This taut debut about a working-class young man wrestling with masculinity and lack of opportunity feels like a genuinely necessary book</p><p>Novels about precarity are a precarious business. Far too many debuts of recent years claim to capture what it is like to be a young person in this age of intersecting economic and social crises, when in reality they focus on a set of experiences that are much narrower, much more class-specific and much more temporary. If you were being uncharitable, you could boil many such books down to “recent arts graduate feels emotionally, financially and erotically unsatisfied and works in the service industry while they figure their life out”. This sense of ennui simply isn’t a luxury that is available to many who are living at the sharp end, where the parlous state of things feels both systemic and permanent.</p><p>Close to Home, the taut and impressive debut by Michael Magee, has none of these limitations and, as a result, feels like that rarest of things: a genuinely necessary book. The novel depicts a period of readjustment for Sean, a reflective, slightly sullen man in his 20s who has returned to Belfast after university. He finds exactly what he left; a network of lives being shaped and misshaped by poverty, addiction, casual violence and trauma. Sean spends his days drinking and sniffing, wrestling with his masculinity, falling in and out of employment and vaguely hoping that a different way of living might eventually present itself. The structural forces that underpin his sense of stasis are ever-present and stifling; a collapsing economy, rampant landlordism and the long, complex shadow that continues to be cast by the Troubles.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/21/close-to-home-by-michael-magee-review-belfast-struggles">Continue reading...</a>

## Living With Chucky review – family history behind notorious horror doll

<p>Documentary profile of the interconnections behind the past and current makers of the long-running franchise is bit of a love-in<br /><br /><br /></p><p>“The family that slays together stays together” finishes this blow-by-blow retrospective of the Child’s Play/Chucky franchise, and it’s certainly impossible to contest that. Not only does the homicide-happy doll gain his own family during the course of the seven films, but actor Brad Dourif – who voiced him – has been succeeded by daughter Fiona as the head of proceedings, and this documentary is directed by Kyra Elise Gardner, daughter of current head puppeteer Tony Gardner. The close-knit ethos might well explain the franchise’s gleefully perverse sense of fun, but the truth is this love-in features too much filler.</p><p>Gardner charts Chucky’s progress from straight-up malefic totem through camp horror icon to revitalised golden-age bogeykid, all under the supervision of creator and series writer Don Mancini (who also directed the last three). As well as spotting a gap in the market that no evil doll had apparently been the star of a movie, Mancini’s great lightbulb moment was amplifying the inherent campness and comedy. In 1998’s pivotal fourth instalment, Bride of Chucky, the formidable Jennifer Tilly was introduced as Chucky’s other half, Tiffany; the actor is on hand here to discuss the shift, summed up even more pertly by John Waters. Why horror’s unshakeable gay following? “They’re drama queens.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/21/living-with-chucky-review-family-history-behind-notorious-horror-doll">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Self-proclaimed ‘pro-natalists’ don’t go around saying that they only want white babies, but there’s a thin line between their movement and the ‘great replacement theory’</p><p>Simone and Malcolm Collins are a thirtysomething couple with three kids called Torsten, Octavian, and Titan Invictus.

Maybe the sort of fantasy you’d be best off keeping to yourself? The Collinses disagree. They’ve made themselves the poster children of “pro-natalism” and are taking it upon themselves to combat what they describe as “<a href="https://pronatalist.org/">fertility collapse</a>” – not only by having multiple kids themselves but by trying to push for policies that would increase birth rates in the developed world.

## Zoe Lyons: Bald Ambition review – taking on midlife with ‘grief and relief’

<p><strong>The Hawth, Crawley<br /></strong>The standup’s new show takes a while to get going, but squares up to hitting 50 with material finely balanced between the thoughtful and the uproarious</p><p>Given how often comics joke about getting old – all those grumpy gags about young people and the confusing nature of modern living – it’s surprising how seldom one encounters meaningful consideration of the midlife crisis in standup. Or so I found myself thinking midway through <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/oct/18/zoe-lyons-comedian">Zoe Lyons</a>’ touring show Bald Ambition. Lyons’ show isn’t perfect: the first half is partly throat-clearing before the main event, and sometimes her depiction of existential drift aged 50 tends towards the sitcom. But there are also vivid jokes and set-pieces here, in an account of hitting the (just past) halfway stage of life that’s distinguished by emotional honesty as well as good humour.</p><p>Most of that comes after the interval, when the show is strongest. Act One roams across Covid, an accident Lyons had while skiing, and her supposedly faltering career – which tees up a risky running joke about how little she wants to be here. It culminates with our host becoming the public face of alopecia after losing her hair to stress – prompted, she says, by midlife angst, among other things.</p><p><a href="https://zoelyons.seetickets.com/tour/zoe-lyons">Touring until 14 May</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/apr/21/zoe-lyons-review-taking-on-midlife-bald-ambition">Continue reading...</a>

## Cholera resurges in Syria after earthquakes hamper efforts to control outbreak

<p>Successful vaccination campaign has been severely disrupted by the devastation in February that caused widespread damage to water supply and transport links</p><p>It had been difficult, but by January, doctors across north-west Syria believed they had almost beaten a major outbreak of cholera. An estimated 50,000 infections and almost 100 deaths had been recorded in Idlib and neighbouring Aleppo governorates between August and December. The outbreak had even spilled over into neighbouring Lebanon, <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2022-DON416">the first case</a> in the country since 1993, resulting in at least one death. But a planned vaccination campaign was meant to mark the end of the surge in cases.</p><p>Then <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/12/what-shall-we-do-millions-displaced-in-turkey-and-syria-after-earthquake">two earthquakes</a> struck the region in early February, compounding the worsening living conditions, destroying infrastructure and further displacing many people who had already fled to Idlib to escape fighting elsewhere. The earthquakes killed more than 4,000 people across north-west Syria, rupturing underground piping and damaging hospitals. Floods and windstorms destroyed thousands of homes in the weeks after the shocks.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/apr/21/cholera-resurges-in-syria-after-earthquakes-hamper-efforts-to-control-outbreak">Continue reading...</a>

## Dead Ringers review – Rachel Weisz has wicked fun as terrifying, sex-swapped twins

<p>This reworking of David Cronenberg’s creepy 80s movie is fast, fierce, funny and properly feminist. Weisz’s turns as a pair of gynaecologist siblings are absolutely knockout</p><p>Dead Ringers opens with a bravura set piece that establishes much of the tone for what’s to come. Twin doctors Elliot and Beverly Mantle are in a bar after a hard day of delivering babies and battling emergencies when a tiresome man decides to disturb their peace with his “friendliness” and “banter”. They take it in turns to beat the verbal crap out of the dickhead – whom they decide, over his baffled objections, to name “Larry”. This perks them up at least as much as their drinks and ends in their total victory. It’s fast, fierce, very funny, properly feminist and a fine way to open a show about a pair of gynaecologist sisters bent on revolutionising maternity and women’s health care. That at least one of the pair is already edged with delicious wildness is just a bonus.</p><p>The Mantle twins are played by Rachel Weisz and what a great time she has with them both, and what a great time she gives the viewers. Beverly is the quieter, more insecure, more cerebral half of the pair and her vision of the future Mantle birthing centre revolves round the empowerment of patients and the removal of the accrued stigmas and myths around pregnancy, childbirth and women’s bits generally. Chillier Elliot is happiest in the lab and envisions a state-of-the-art facility where she can make fertility miracles happen and push the boundaries of what is feasible in bespoke babies. But I’m sure their radically different approaches will prove nothing but fruitfully complementary and definitely not tear them apart like a perineum in a breech birth.</p><p>Dead Ringers is on Prime Video.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/21/dead-ringers-review-rachel-weisz-has-wicked-fun-as-terrifying-sex-swapped-twins">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Record Store Day will have music fans queuing up this weekend – but how do these shops survive, and what do they bring to the high street in 2023? Our writer puts in a shift at Jumbo in Leeds to find out</p><p>As a teenager in Leeds in the 1980s, the centre of my universe was<a href="https://www.jumborecords.co.uk/index.asp"> Jumbo Records</a>. I bought all my New Order and Smiths singles there. The tiny unit in the Merrion Centre shopping precinct even hosted one of my earliest conversations with a pop star, when Billy Bragg played an in-store gig with loudspeakers on his shoulders. My week was geared around listening to John Peel, reading NME, watching Top of the Pops and heading to Jumbo on a Saturday to pick up the latest vinyl treasure.</p><p>“Saturday was like <a href="https://recordstoreday.co.uk/">Record Store Day</a> is now, but every week,” remembers Choque Hosein, who worked in Jumbo then. “People queued up for us to open and then they’d be four deep at the counter.

<p>High-profile protests at the Grand National and the World Snooker Championships made headlines around the country; the London Marathon could be next.
