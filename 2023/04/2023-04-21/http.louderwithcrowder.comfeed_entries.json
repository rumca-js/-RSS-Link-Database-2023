The girls closed their eyes and tried to shower as quickly as possible. The girls reportedly weren't sure what to do at first, and didn't immediately report the incident. But another student whom the girls had confided in reported the incident to student services. However, the Title IX coordinator was not contacted about the alleged sexual assault. Instead, the Associate Principal asked for the names of the girls. </p><p><em>\"There is no indication anyone at EHS took any action at that time.\"</em></p><p>The school also failed to contact the girls' parents, did not file the federally-required Title IX complaint, provided zero support to the victimized girls, and did not act as \"mandatory reporters\" under Wisconsin law. </p><p>Three words: HOME.
