[{"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Google reportedly halts construction of its giant San Jose campus", "description": "<p>Google's long-planned <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/san-jose-google-downtown-west-approved-225211005.html\">80-acre San Jose campus</a> may be on hold, at least for now. <em>CNBC</em><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/21/googles-80-acre-san-jose-mega-campus-on-hold-amid-economic-slowdown-.html\">sources</a> say the Alphabet brand has halted construction of its Downtown West facility after an initial demolition phase. The company reportedly &quot;gutted&quot; the campus development team as part of its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-parent-alphabet-is-laying-off-12000-employees-105523115.html\">large-scale layoffs in January</a>, and froze construction with no word to contractors on when it might resume.</p><p>In a statement to Engadget, a representative says the firm wants its office space to reflect the &quot;future needs&quot; of the business, hybrid workers and the community. Google is still determining &quot;how to best move forward&quot; with the San Jose campus but is &quot;committed&quot; to long-term development in San Jose, the spokesperson adds.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Google <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-21-google-closer-building-city-san-jose.html\">spent years</a> negotiating and designing Downtown West, and received approval in 2021 after promising concessions that include 15,000 housing units across Silicon Valley, $200 million in community support (such as helping displaced businesses) and devoting more than half the campus to public uses. Construction was supposed to start in earnest later this year and take 10 to 30 years. Critics objected to the elimination or relocation of well-known businesses and landmarks, but the potential economic boon for the city was such that Governor Gavin Newsom touted the deal as playing a major role in recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>However, it's the pandemic that ultimately put Google in its current position. The company has hired aggressively in previous years (its ranks have grown 20 percent since 2017), but is laying off around 12,000 employees this year as would-be ad and cloud service customers tighten their budgets. Google is also adopting a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-wants-employees-to-return-to-the-office-on-april-4th-204334929.html\">hybrid work strategy</a> that lets staff stay home some of the time. Simply put, there's not as much need for offices as there was before.</p><p>This doesn't mean Downtown West is dead. The potentially decades-long timeframe for the project gives Google some flexibility. However, the uncertainty leaves San Jose in an awkward state. Google has cleared out a large area, but isn't building the campus that's supposed to bring jobs and economic activity to the region.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-reportedly-halts-construction-of-its-giant-san-jose-campus-210845053.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/google-reportedly-halts-construction-of-its-giant-san-jose-campus-210845053.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-21 21:08:45+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "GMC decks out new EV Hummer SUVs and trucks with delayed 3X trim option", "description": "<p>After the successful launch of the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/hummer-ev-first-drive-an-enormous-electric-super-truck-133030316.html\"><ins>GMC Hummer EV Pickup</ins></a>, the company announced new electric trucks and SUVs with plenty of customization options, including a 3X trim option.

The 3X trim package will be available for the <a href=\"https://media.gmc.com/media/us/en/gmc/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2023/apr/0421-hummer.html\"><ins>2023 Hummer EV Pickup and the 2024 Hummer EV SUV</ins></a> and will ship standard with 22-inch wheels and 35-inch all-terrain tires.</p><p>Overall, the SUV and pickup both come in two trims, Edition 1 and 3X. For the pickup, you can get the 3X trim with an optional extreme off-road package; for the SUV, you can get both models with the off-road package. In addition to the increased customization options available for these vehicles, GMC has updated range estimates for the forthcoming models. The company announced that these trucks will ride up to 355 miles per charge, though this metric does decrease with certain configuration packages.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>For instance, choosing the Extreme Off-Road Package nets you rubber tires designed for mud, extra skid plates and additional underbody cameras, but your range slides down to 329 miles per charge. The original Edition 1 of these EV trucks got 330 miles in the lightest configuration, so the battery tech has certainly improved since the 2020 launch. The EV SUV line boasts a slightly lower range, at 298 to 314 miles per charge (again depending on which trim and configuration you choose).</p><p>GMC is still holding some specs close to the chest, but we do know that the new models still feature the same three-motor layout as prior generations, with an estimated 1,000 horsepower. That\u2019s plenty of get-up-and-go. Depending on the configuration, you\u2019ll be able to tow anywhere from 7,500 to 8,500 pounds with one of these electric beasts.</p><p>Despite a robust starting price tag of $80,000, consumers are definitely interested in GMC\u2019s new electric trucks. Preorders went live back in September and quickly sold through 65,000 units. In other words, reservations are currently full but that could change in the future. We\u2019ll keep you updated.

This is a two-quart model, so it's not ideal if you want to cook for several people, but we've found it effective for smaller servings and side dishes like french fries, tofu, wings and the like. Its dial controls and four preprogrammed settings (air fry, bake, roast, reheat) are simple to use, and the whole thing takes up little countertop space. This deal is $5 more than the device's all-time low but roughly $10 less than its typical street price.

It carries over features like <a href=\"https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/9984225?hl=en\">HVAC system monitoring</a> and voice assistant control as well, and unlike the pricier model, it supports the new <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/matter-smart-home-standard-released-160059101.html\">Matter smart home standard</a>.

Boost has emerged as an option with a more elegant and easier way of doing things than some of its rivals. Rather than wire in controllers, battery hardware and a hall effect sensor, almost all of the necessary gear is built into a custom-made rear-hub motor. Everything else, meanwhile, is included in a circular battery pack that sits inside a bottle cage, or something that looks a lot like it, which is mounted to your downtube.</p><p>Whereas with, say, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/swytch-air-kit-hands-on-2023-140001457.html\">Swytch</a>, which sells you a custom front wheel for you to attach to your bike, Boost goes on the back. That means the initial installation is a little more intensive, since you\u2019ll need to add your cassette, string-in the chain and get the analog stuff all set up nicely. Or, you know, ask the technicians at your local bike repair store to do it for you if you\u2019re a ten-thumbed menace to engineering like me. But, after that point, all you\u2019ll need to do is screw in the bottle cage and ziptie a wire that runs from the rear wheel the downtube and you\u2019re pretty much set.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>It\u2019s screenless, and part of this is because all of the torque sensors are included within the motor, and also to help keep costs down. Users can, if they need, connect to the companion app where they can set the power assist in either Eco or Boost modes. You\u2019ll also get a short speed-boost option to help you get away from traffic, which maxes out the motor for a very brief period of time. The app also has a dashboard mode so, if you mount your phone on the handlebars, you can keep an eye on your speed, distance and battery level.</p><p>And the battery itself has a USB-A port hidden under a dust cover, enabling you to charge your device, or run a USB-powered light set, while riding.</p><p>Since the Boost was set up at the UK\u2019s Cycle Show today, I was able to give it a go while hooked up to a turbo trainer. I found that it didn\u2019t take very long at all before the level of boost the eco mode offered felt like it would be more than enough to get me across town each day. When the boost mode was activated, it quickly felt like too much power, an option you\u2019d only ever need when you\u2019re tackling steep hills and little else.</p><p>In terms of pricing, <a href=\"https://boostbike.uk/shop\">Boost</a> is presently available in the UK and costs \u00a3695 when installed by a local cycling store. If you fancy tackling the installation yourself, you can also pick up the kit for \u00a3645, although the company also offers the motor and battery set for people to build their own wheels. It\u2019s certainly an interesting twist on e-bike conversion kits, and one I\u2019d be very interested in trying for myself in future.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/boosts-e-bike-conversion-kit-offers-elegant-and-discreet-power-145512381.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/boosts-e-bike-conversion-kit-offers-elegant-and-discreet-power-145512381.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-21 14:55:12+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "How to shop for a smart grill", "description": "<p>Smart grills are expensive. Companies definitely make you pay a premium for the conveniences that a little WiFi can afford. When it comes to pellet grills, you\u2019re likely going to pay over $1,000. Ditto for gas models that have wireless connectivity. For this reason, it\u2019s important to consider what types of cooking you plan to do and how often you plan to do it when you\u2019re shopping. Do you cook burgers for warm-weather holidays or sear the occasional steak? Dropping that much money might be overkill. But if you prefer to cook outdoors nearly year-round and are ready to expand your culinary skills to include low-and-slow smoking, you\u2019re in the right place.</p><p>The real benefit of a smart grill is being able to keep tabs on your food without having to stand next to it the whole time.

This adds nearly every smart function to any grill. Weber\u2019s app not only offers tips for how to prep food, but it also walks you through the entire process \u2013 from flipping to wrapping and resting. Timers let you know when the next step is coming and the hardware/software combo can even estimate when the cook will be complete. That last bit comes in handy when smoking things like brisket that can take 8-12 hours. The Hub can accommodate up to four probes, so you can keep tabs on multiple foods and grill temp via the simple on-board interface.</p><p>If having cables criss-crossing the inside of your grill sounds like a hassle, and it very well can be at times, there are wireless options available for keeping tabs on temperature.

It\u2019s completely wire-free and it\u2019s equipped with two temperature sensors: one for internal food temps and one for the ambient temp of your grill on the other end. The Meater app has a guided cook system for step-by-step directions and an estimator algorithm predicts how long it will take to cook and rest your food. Meater Plus also has a built-in Bluetooth repeater in the charger that extends range up to 165 feet.</p><h2>Pellet grills</h2><figure><img alt=\"Traeger Pro 575 pellet grill\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-05/291129c0-dc39-11ec-9d84-163a65ef6c92\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Traeger\n </div></figure><p>When it comes to smart grills, the backyard cookers that burn wood pellets are some of the most popular models. Basically, a heating element in the bottom of the grill ignites compressed wood that\u2019s fed to the fire pot via an auger. A fan that\u2019s run by a controller on the grill regulates the size of the flame and overall temperature. Of course, all of this is done automatically once you set the temperature. What\u2019s more, WiFi-enabled pellet grills allow you to monitor and adjust temperatures from your phone, so you can stay inside and entertain your guests.</p><p>A key advantage of pellet grills is their versatility. Most of them can handle low-and-slow cooking at as little as 180 degrees Fahrenheit, as well as searing high-heat temps of 600 degrees or higher. This gives you the ability to cook everything from brisket, ribs and pork butts to burgers, pizza and steaks. Some even have a slider that allows you to sear over the flame of the fire box. These grills allow you to \u201cset it and forget it\u201d for long cooks, and even for short ones, they don\u2019t require much attention other than flipping or saucing foods.</p><p>There are more affordable smart pellet grills on the market, but for the mix of hardware and software performance, <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy50cmFlZ2VyLmNvbS9wZWxsZXQtZ3JpbGxzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzNmJmZTAwMi01ZDFlLTRmNzItOTA1Mi03OTc3YjM4OWRkYjcifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUq3Ih3SzGsphVNHruYVHk3nqxHnJea47eydwfMsZv-w&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.traeger.com%2Fpellet-grills\">Traeger</a> and <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=de57025b-1082-4622-af33-0312dca51a60&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Weber+USA&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJkZTU3MDI1Yi0xMDgyLTQ2MjItYWYzMy0wMzEyZGNhNTFhNjAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2ViZXIuY29tL1VTL2VuL3dvb2QtcGVsbGV0LyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzZiZmUwMDItNWQxZS00ZjcyLTkwNTItNzk3N2IzODlkZGI3In0&amp;signature=AQAAAaCTbQXN6ye4-55021QM0ct_GPQJImQKg3aKhKkklqEB&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.weber.com%2FUS%2Fen%2Fwood-pellet%2F\">Weber</a> are the best picks. Traeger has a variety of models, almost all of which are WiFi-equipped, starting at $800. The company\u2019s completely redesigned Timberline series is basically an outdoor kitchen. It can accommodate a variety of accessories to expand its abilities and there\u2019s a built-in induction burner on the side for making sauces, cooking sides, and searing. The cook chamber has double-wall insulation and the grill comes with a set of Meater wireless thermometers that connect to its touchscreen controller. However, all of the updates to the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy50cmFlZ2VyLmNvbS90aW1iZXJsaW5lIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzNmJmZTAwMi01ZDFlLTRmNzItOTA1Mi03OTc3YjM4OWRkYjcifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfg8b_Jr4mMETR9wA0daq3jrkW9AJ6J98UlFujwOnVov&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.traeger.com%2Ftimberline\">Timberline</a> will cost you a whopping $3,500. And that\u2019s for the smallest size.</p><p>For 2023, Trager also redesigned the Ironwood series, giving it a lot of the updates that the new Timberline offers. There\u2019s no induction burner, wood shelving, storage or dual-wall construction, but the touchscreen controls, new accessories (including a modular rail system) and, most importantly, the company\u2019s redesigned grease and ash management system are all here. The Ironwood does have an open shelf on the bottom and a large side shelf in place of the Timberline\u2019s burner. And while it doesn\u2019t ship with Meater probes, this grill does support them if you buy them separately ($230 for a two-pack). The lack of high-end features makes the Ironwood far more affordable, starting at $1,800.</p><p>With the Traeger app, you get access to a massive library of recipes, all of which can be sent to the grill so you don\u2019t have to dial in the settings. You also get step-by-step instructions, timers, food probe temps and the ability to activate special modes. All of that is in addition to remote control and monitoring for grill temperature. The software is compatible with all of the company\u2019s WiFire-enabled models, including older ones, so you don\u2019t need the newest Timberline or Ironwood to take advantage of what the app has to offer.</p><p>With <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=de57025b-1082-4622-af33-0312dca51a60&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Weber+USA&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJkZTU3MDI1Yi0xMDgyLTQ2MjItYWYzMy0wMzEyZGNhNTFhNjAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2ViZXIuY29tL1VTL2VuL3dvb2QtcGVsbGV0L3Ntb2tlZmlyZS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjM2YmZlMDAyLTVkMWUtNGY3Mi05MDUyLTc5NzdiMzg5ZGRiNyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAUGITL43UJhbbKsAyFoEnYkP9CbBuiBw8tld4ArabXW9&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.weber.com%2FUS%2Fen%2Fwood-pellet%2Fsmokefire%2F\">Weber\u2019s SmokeFire grill</a>, you get the connectivity and convenience a lot of pellet grills can offer. There\u2019s only one model, but it comes in two sizes to suit your needs, and the company has refined it with multiple versions since the original debuted in 2020. Weber Connect is a handy culinary companion that not only controls the grill, but it also provides guided details for every step in the cooking process. One of its key features is the estimated completion time, which helps you to know when your food will be ready. It\u2019s very handy when you have a hungry crowd asking how the pulled pork sandwiches are coming. During my tests, I was also impressed by how much smoke flavor the SmokeFire gave the food. Weber\u2019s pellet grill doesn\u2019t have a solid plate covering the fire pot like some Traeger models, so smoke moves around the cook chamber differently.</p><h2>Gas grills</h2><figure><img alt=\"Weber Genesis E-325s gas grill\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-05/45e69a30-dc39-11ec-b37b-2fe2781b1822\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Engadget\n </div></figure><p>Smart options aren\u2019t limited to pellet grills, though. If you don\u2019t have a need for the lower-temperature cooking, a propane or natural gas model might be a better option. In 2021, Weber brought its Connect smart grilling platform to its <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=de57025b-1082-4622-af33-0312dca51a60&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Weber+USA&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJkZTU3MDI1Yi0xMDgyLTQ2MjItYWYzMy0wMzEyZGNhNTFhNjAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2ViZXIuY29tL1VTL2VuL2dhcy9nZW5lc2lzLz8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjM2YmZlMDAyLTVkMWUtNGY3Mi05MDUyLTc5NzdiMzg5ZGRiNyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAfCZe-02RXKJsbtJi9J5JO0S9sDaeH_ZZ4mMl4N6o8Vy&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.weber.com%2FUS%2Fen%2Fgas%2Fgenesis%2F%3F\">gas grills</a>, offering three- and four-burner configurations, some of which also have a side burner for extra cooking space. Just like on the SmokeFire, Weber Connect not only allows you to monitor both food and grill temperatures from a comfy chair, it can guide you through the process and give you time updates. You still have to manually adjust the burners, but Weber\u2019s app can alert you when you\u2019re running low on fuel (propane models).</p><h2>Other types of smart grills</h2><figure><img alt=\"Masterbuilt Gravity 560\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-05/5b535fc0-dc39-11ec-9e3f-a5db6f6cb4c2\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Masterbuilt\n </div></figure><p>Both pellet and gas grills have their merits, but some folks prefer the tried-and-true flavor of charcoal when cooking outdoors. While the purchase of one of the previously mentioned accessories will probably achieve what you're after for a kettle or kamado-style grill you already have, there are some charcoal smart grills that offer a degree of connectivity for your cooks.</p><p>For fans of the kamado-style ceramic grills, Kamado Joe recently announced the <a href=\"https://www.kamadojoe.com/products/konnected-joe\">Konnected Joe</a>. Silly spellings aside, the unit addresses two key issues with these types of grills: lighting the charcoal and regulating temperature. To help with the former, the company installed an ignition system in the bottom of the cooking chamber that lights the fuel at the press of a button. The Konnected Joe is also equipped with built-in smart grilling features that help you keep the temps consistent while being able to monitor food and grill temps remotely via an app. Before now, if you wanted smart features on a Kamado Joe grill, you had to invest in the iKammand add-on. The big caveat here is that I haven\u2019t yet tested one yet. They were announced in March but won\u2019t ship until June (pre-orders are open though). At $1,699, this grill is another significant investment, though that figure is on par with the company\u2019s other models that lack the added features connectivity brings.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-smart-grills-and-how-to-choose-one-153006286.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/best-smart-grills-and-how-to-choose-one-153006286.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-21 14:47:31+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Quella\u2019s gorgeous retro cafe racer e-bikes are for people who don\u2019t want to ride an e-bike", "description": "<p>I\u2019m no cyclist, but I\u2019ve always had a soft spot for retro-style cafe racer bikes with clean lines and a lack of unnecessary engineering. A lovely triangular frame, two narrow wheels, caliper brakes and a lovely paint job make the perfect bike for tootling around town. Years ago one company \u2014 <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2012-07-17-faraday-e-bike-launches.html\">Faraday</a> \u2014 made an early hit on Kickstarter with its version of the old-school bike that, sadly, I never got to ride. Today at the UK\u2019s Cycle Show, however, I stumbled across Quella\u2019s range of retro e-bikes and already I\u2019m in love.</p><p>Its <a href=\"https://www.quellabicycle.com/shop/quella-electric-varsity-collection-oxford/\">Varsity collection</a> has been around for a while, but the addition of electric options is relatively new. Rather than screw on a whole bunch of tech to the existing frame, all of the electronics are contained within the Zehus-made rear hub. That includes the battery, torque sensor, a GPS tracker, Bluetooth and, of course, the motor itself, with a peak output of 250W. The idea being you should just start pedaling and let the bike work out how much power you need at any given time.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>There\u2019s a lack of gears, both to add a greater level of mechanical simplicity and also because that\u2019s just how these bikes usually roll. And while it ships as a single-speed, it\u2019s packing a flip-flop hub, so you can convert it into a fixie if you\u2019re, you know, a fixie rider (it\u2019s okay, I won\u2019t judge). Of more interest to me, however, is that if you pedal backwards when coasting, you can trigger the bike\u2019s energy-recovery system to re-charge the battery. It\u2019s a great feature given the lack of obvious tech here, and also ideal for a low-stakes bike like this.</p><p>This sense of low-stakes carries on through to the fact it\u2019s really only designed for commutes on flat ground. The pedal assist will only push you to speeds of 15 miles per hour, and with 40Nm of torque and the lack of gearing, it probably won\u2019t help you on a serious hill climb. But you can edit your speed profile with the companion app, letting you switch from low to high-power when you need that little bit more <em>oopmh</em>. The company says you should hope to get close to 40 miles of range from a single charge, and more if you\u2019re particularly judicious about its use.</p><p>If there\u2019s a downside, it\u2019s that you\u2019ll be spending the better part of \u00a32,000 (around $2,475) on one, which is a serious chunk of change. But if you\u2019re in the market for something that offers style first, practicality second and a lightweight frame third, this is something it\u2019d be worth checking out.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/quellas-gorgeous-retro-cafe-racer-e-bikes-are-for-people-who-dont-want-to-ride-an-e-bike-143056450.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/quellas-gorgeous-retro-cafe-racer-e-bikes-are-for-people-who-dont-want-to-ride-an-e-bike-143056450.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-21 14:30:56+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "You can't share Xbox clips directly to Twitter anymore", "description": "<p>Gamers who want to post clips of a cool multikill they pulled off in <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/halo-infinite/\"><em><ins>Halo Infinite</ins></em></a> or something ridiculous that happened in <em>Sea of Thieves</em> to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/twitter/\"><ins>Twitter</ins></a> may need to take an extra couple of steps to share their captures.

Any advertiser already running at least $1,000 in ads will automatically be considered verified. The requirements reflect broader verification system changes that will make for a &quot;superior&quot; experience, Twitter claims.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Both changes come a day after Twitter acted on its months-long plan to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-starts-pulling-legacy-blue-verification-checkmarks-205010576.html\">remove legacy verification checkmarks</a>. Now, only Blue subscribers receive a blue checkmark. Businesses can receive gold verifications, while government and multilateral organization accounts can have gray checks. Numerous previously verified stars and organizations have resisted paying for the blue tick, and Elon Musk has even acknowledged <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1649181726395052039\">paying</a> for Blue subscriptions for celebrities like LeBron James, Stephen King and William Shatner.</p><p>Blue and the new advertiser rules are meant to reduce Twitter's dependence on conventional ad revenue and move toward subscriptions. However, memberships might be enough this year.

As with the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-blue-subscriptions-not-working-134310199.html\">initial Blue launch</a>, there has also been a rash of impersonators abusing the lack of verifications.

It had the usual mix of rough dialog, clunky plotting and pandered to its audience with a mix of nostalgia and continuity porn in place of saying anything of note. But what it, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-picard-309-vox-review-140046969.html\">and the previous episode</a>, did do was offer up a breezy hour of action that, above all else, was fun. After choking down on eight hours of stodgy, high-school-level melodrama, this was a vital and necessary corrective.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>\u201cThe Last Generation\u201d opens with a plea from President Anton Chekov* (Walter Koenig) saying Earth is about to fall to the Bio Borg fleet. The Enterprise races to the (hopefully) last Borg Cube hiding in Jupiter\u2019s eye, where the Borg Queen has ensnared Jack as her transmitter. How do we know this? Well, it was obvious that Jack, as the Queen\u2019s \u201cvoice,\u201d would be key to activating the drones, but also because this series can\u2019t help but remind us what\u2019s going on.</p><p>Remember the last episode, when the fleet was taken over by the Borg and was about to launch an offensive on Earth? This show doesn\u2019t think you did, which is why we have Patrick Stewart say lines like \u201cthe fleet is being controlled by the collective,\u201d and \u201cthat cube is projecting a signal across the solar system\u201d and \u201cthe only way to save Earth is to sever that connection, no matter the cost\u201d You know, stuff you saw at least once last week and then again in the \u201cPreviously On.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a similar problem when we watch the surprisingly-small Federation fleet point toward Earth. On the Titan\u2019s bridge, we see a map of the world\u2019s major locations quickly engulfed by a series of red dots, which was a neatly elegant way of communicating what was going on. Unfortunately Raffi, so often relegated to exposition dispenser, has to restate what we\u2019ve literally just seen. \u201cThe fleet is targeting every city,\u201d \u2013 yup, we saw, thanks \u2013 \u201cevery major population center on the planet,\u201d \u2013 yup, still with you. Given how often this crops up, I wonder if Paramount did research that found most people scroll their phones while watching so need their hands holding with some nice radio-style narration.</p><p>The Enterprise shows up at Jupiter and is utterly dwarfed by the cube lurking in the storm, and I love the sense of scale afforded here. Picard, Riker and Worf \u2013 Michael Dorn given yet another goofy gracenote as he pledges to make the away team a threesome \u2013 set off. They give their milky-eyed farewells and then beam over to the cube with a mission to both stop the signal and rescue Jack. The pace at which the narrative moves here, again, makes the preceding eight episodes feel like more of a punishment. Here, things happen, there\u2019s no paddling around in circles trying to stretch the runtime, in fact, it\u2019s quite the opposite.</p><p>Meanwhile, the crew of the Titan manage to fight their way to the bridge and beam the Bio Borg to a locked transporter room. Severed from the fleet, it\u2019s up to Seven, Raffi and some low-ranking crew to mount a single-handed defense of Earth. Sadly, the Titan doesn\u2019t have a regular crew, full of competent professionals who crack on with the job at hand, but a <em>movie</em> crew. You know, who have almost no prior experience but after a (not very) rousing pep-talk, will rise to the occasion and save the day.</p><p>On the cube, the gang find the Borg are a shadow of their former shelves, with a handful of drones still alive. The rest have withered away courtesy of Captain\u2026 Janeway, who doesn\u2019t even get an honorable mention for her trouble. The Queen (Alice Krige), meanwhile, looms in the darkness over Jack, who is now wearing the Locutus outfit and controlling the fleet. If you\u2019re waiting for me to make the obvious comparison to <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em>, you\u2019ll have to wait \u2013 I'm saving my one <em>Star Wars</em> reference for the next paragraph. We even get time for one more goofy joke featuring Riker trying, and failing, to pick up a Mek\u2019leth, too.</p><p>Over on the Enterprise, the crew quickly work out that they\u2019ll need to physically destroy the wireless transmitter that is beaming instructions to the Bio Borg drones. And this wireless transmitter is, for some reason, lurking at the heart of the cube accessible only through an impossible route. And so Data\u2019s gracenote is to ask the gang to trust his gut while he drives the Enterprise on an homage through the half-completed Death Star from <em>Return of the Jedi</em>. Whoops, wrong <em>Star</em> franchise, Terry! But if they do destroy the transmitter, it\u2019ll also burn out the whole cube (pesky WiFi radios, with their explosive power and all), with Geordi and Beverly locking eyes knowing that to act now will condemn Jack to death, but to delay won\u2019t just condemn Sidney and Alandra to death, but everyone else as well.</p><p>The Queen, who I\u2019m fairly sure didn\u2019t have her own arms in any of her appearances before and yet now has grown a pair, has Jack under her control. After repeating several of the same lines from their confrontation in <em>First Contact,</em> Picard decides to plug himself back into the collective to save his son. The only way he can do so, of course, is by opening up to Jack, admitting that this need for connection while also keeping people away is what drove him to Starfleet. But, because we\u2019ve got plenty more stuff to get through, all it takes is Picard to hug Jack and his Hedgehog\u2019s Dilemma is resolved. There\u2019s even a montage of shots from earlier in the series which, if you weren\u2019t paying attention, might suggest this thread was properly developed, but it\u2019s hard not to be carried away \u2013 again, mostly on the vibes.</p><p>With Jack free, the Enterprise opens fire to destroy the cube and then makes a last-second run to rescue the gang. It\u2019s all very, uh, triumphant, isn\u2019t it, and I reckon that if we\u2019d seen this happen in 1993 or so, it would have blown our tiny minds. With the cube destroyed, the Bio Borgs all return to normality, and we can crack on with our happy ending. Data overstays his welcome in a therapy session with Deanna, Worf leaks details of Raffi\u2019s heroism so her family respects her again, Crusher finds a way to fix the Borg mutation (and catch changelings in the process) and Tuvok hands Seven command of the Titan, as recommended by Shaw. Now, we could rightly ask why Shaw privately praised Seven, even using her chosen name in his annual review, and yet serially belittled and humiliated her in front of the crew. But you knew from the get go his arc would be redemptive, and the groundwork has already been laid for his potential resurrection.</p><p>A year later, the Enterprise D is in the fleet museum, and Jack Crusher has been nepo-baby fast-tracked through the academy and is now ready for his first posting. We know we\u2019re going to get a hero ship reveal, because the<em> Picard </em>theme suddenly includes the bells used so well in Leonard Rosenman\u2019s <em>Voyage Home</em> score. At the rebuilt spacedock, we see the Titan A \u2013 already an awkward re-brand from the original Titan \u2013 has now been re-rechristened as the Enterprise G. Why? Because, uh, heroism, or something, and not as part of a shameless attempt to use this entire third season as a backdoor pilot for a spinoff.</p><p>The new Enterprise heads off, back to the M\u2019Talas system, with Seven, Raffi and Jack all now on the bridge. Jack may be an ensign, but he\u2019s been posted as \u201ccounselor to the captain\u201d to keep Ed Speelers on the bridge. Who\u2019d have thought that Starfleet would have given command of the Federation\u2019s flagship to a \u201cthief, a pirate and a spy,\u201d well, not this dude. But then this is new Star Trek, where narrative gravity will pull everything into a structure that closely resembles what went before.</p><p>There\u2019s a new Enterprise with a Crusher in one chair and a LaForge in another, because a family name and the inherited genes that come along with it are far more important than anything else these days. There\u2019s even a mid-credits stinger featuring John deLancie\u2019s Q, who you might recall very prominently died in season two. He\u2019s back in full asshole mode, and is ready to put Jack through the same paces he did with his father back in the late \u201880s. Meet the new villain, quite literally the same as the old one.</p><p>You know, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll hear the news that <em>Terry Matalas\u2019 Star Trek: Legacy, featuring the Enterprise G\u2019s adventures in the M\u2019talas system,</em> has been commissioned in the next week. Paramount needs to capitalize on <em>Picard\u2019s</em> outgoing hype and popularity, and I\u2019m interested to see which flavor of show we get \u2013 one with the tone of the first eight episodes, or the last two. And to see how many elements of Golden-Era Trek history will get strip-mined for inspiration to keep fans onside. I wish it well, though, because this has worked for some sections of the fans, and I\u2019m happy that they liked it, even if it left an often sour taste for me.</p><p>And while the <em>next </em>next generation, or what\u2019s left of it, heads off, our crew go to Ten Forward to get hammered together. If you know your <em>Next Generation</em> history, you\u2019ll know this gang went through a fairly rough time together and bonded in that early adversity. The chemistry, warmth and love exhibited by these characters isn\u2019t fake, as anyone who has seen this bunch on the convention circuit will tell you. Their history is <em>our</em> history and I can\u2019t begrudge anyone who opted to point a camera on these seven and let it play out. Of course they have to wind up playing poker, because that\u2019s what these characters did. It was a sign of Picard\u2019s growth the first time around that he opted to join the weekly poker game, and now they\u2019ve all not just grown old, but grown old together, off-screen at least. And as, by my ear, the <em>Final Frontier</em> mix of the Goldsmith theme starts to play, we roll credits. At least that last bit was fun, wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>* Much as it reinforces the hateful shrinking of the Trek narrative universe, because<em> of course</em> Chekov\u2019s kid winds up as Earth President, it was a nice nod to the late Anton Yelchin.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-picard-3-10-the-last-generation-review-140006372.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-picard-3-10-the-last-generation-review-140006372.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-21 14:00:06+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The best grills and grill accessories in 2023", "description": "<p>It\u2019s not quite summer yet, but early spring is a good time to get ready for the grilling season.

The company completely redesigned its high-end <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy50cmFlZ2VyLmNvbS9wZWxsZXQtZ3JpbGxzL3RpbWJlcmxpbmUiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijc3MGUzZjBmLWQ1NzMtMzViNC1iYWY3LTY3MTE4ZDQ3YTVmZCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAY6xk7AJryYndkbXlUQosd_ev4NmjvSQodyPfMedOgBX&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.traeger.com%2Fpellet-grills%2Ftimberline\">Timberline series</a>, turning its premium pellet grills into outdoor kitchens. While the cooking chamber may look like any other Traeger grill, the company decided to put these new models on a rolling cart instead of four legs. Of course, this gives you more storage, but it also makes it easier to empty the pellet hopper. There\u2019s a rail system on the front and sides of the grill to hold a range of accessories from paper rolls, to sauce and rub compartments.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>In terms of tech, Traeger swapped out the basic controls from its previous WiFi-equipped D2 grills in favor of a color touchscreen. There are more sensors inside to keep tabs on the cooking process and added lighting to help you see the cooking surface better after dark. The new Timberlines will also work with a specially-designed version of the wireless Meater probes (Traeger bought Meater in 2021), so you\u2019re not reliant on the corded version that comes standard. Perhaps most importantly, the company added what it says is the first outdoor-rated induction burner for sauces, sides and searing.</p><p>All of those upgrades lead to a starting price of $3,500. If you can forgo some of those niceties (I\u2019d argue your grill doesn\u2019t need a touchscreen, for example), the first-gen Ironwood has been a workhorse for me since I reviewed it <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-24-traeger-ironwood-650-review-wifi-pellet-grill-smoker.html\">in 2019</a>. It still runs like a champ and works well with the company\u2019s full-featured app. It\u2019s a great option for someone looking to dive into pellet grills, offering a bit more than the entry-level Pro series from Traeger. The company still sells the original Ironwood even though <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/traegers-redesigned-ironwood-grills-pack-touchscreen-controls-and-more-efficiency-150010372.html\">it updated the model for 2023</a>, and you can get the larger size for $2,000 less than the smallest of the new Timberlines.</p><h2>Weber Genesis II EPX-335</h2><p></p><p>In 2021, Weber introduced <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/weber-connect-smart-gas-grills-171237945.html\">its first smart gas grills</a>. After developing its Weber Connect platform for the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/weber-smokefire-review-wifi-pellet-grill-140000499.html\">SmokeFire pellet grills</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-04-03-weber-connect-smart-grilling-hub-review.html\">Smart Grilling Hub</a>, the company brought its Wi-Fi-connected cooking to a more widely used fuel source. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/weber-2022-grill-lineup-genesis-smokefire-weber-connect-140518150.html\">Last year</a>, the company refined things a bit with PureBlu high-heat burners, sear zone, side table, expandable top cooking grate and \"Nightvision\" LED lighting. If the 2022 <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=de57025b-1082-4622-af33-0312dca51a60&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Weber+USA&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJkZTU3MDI1Yi0xMDgyLTQ2MjItYWYzMy0wMzEyZGNhNTFhNjAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2ViZXIuY29tL1VTL2VuL2dhcy9nZW5lc2lzLzM3ODEwMDAxLmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijc3MGUzZjBmLWQ1NzMtMzViNC1iYWY3LTY3MTE4ZDQ3YTVmZCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAWNp3XItqsMdY7aDMg6z_PvLs2xhizIR1RSh294cx8u0&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.weber.com%2FUS%2Fen%2Fgas%2Fgenesis%2F37810001.html\">EPX-335</a> doesn\u2019t suit your needs, there are other options that come in three- and four-burner configurations with porcelain enamel or stainless steel finishes. Plus, there are both propane and natural gas models, and some come with a side burner if you need it.</p><p>Of course, the main attraction here is the Weber Connect integration. Just like it does on the SmokeFire pellet grills and the Smart Grilling Hub, the technology can guide you through every step of the grilling process. A mix of instructions and videos inside the Weber Connect app offer assistance to grillers of all skill levels, right down to when to flip your steak. What\u2019s more, the system offers real-time food temperatures and estimated readiness countdowns right on your phone so you can better time side dishes (and keep the hangry crowd at bay). On its gas smart grills, Weber Connect can also keep tabs on fuel level so you\u2019ll know when it\u2019s time to swap tanks.</p><p>Weber has also introduced a host of accessories that expand the capabilities of its gas grills. The company makes searing grates, a grilling basket, rotisserie items and a pizza stone. There\u2019s also a griddle insert that allows you to make everything from breakfast to smash burgers. And if you want to transform the entire grilling area, Weber has a full-size griddle accessory that will do just that.</p><h2>Ooni pizza ovens</h2><p></p><p><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=0de15002-ec35-49d8-b24c-3d060213cd2b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Ooni+Pizza+Ovens&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIwZGUxNTAwMi1lYzM1LTQ5ZDgtYjI0Yy0zZDA2MDIxM2NkMmIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9vb25pLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijc3MGUzZjBmLWQ1NzMtMzViNC1iYWY3LTY3MTE4ZDQ3YTVmZCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAejJfnRtktOMij-Jitrj0piUQHMLO_lU1a5e1lGHJHw5&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fooni.com%2F\">Ooni</a> has built a stellar reputation for its pizza ovens, and rightfully so.

First, a hinged door allows you to see what you\u2019re cooking through a glass window. Second, there\u2019s a front-mounted digital thermometer that shows the ambient temperature inside of the oven. Like other Ooni pizza cookers, the Karu 16 heats quickly, reaching 950 degrees Fahrenheit in about 15 minutes. And of course, the larger cooking area will allow you to make things besides pizza. If you can stand a smaller oven and analog thermometers, the company recently introduced the Karu 12G that still has the glass door, increased fuel efficiency and can be outfitted with a gas burner add-on ($100).</p><h2>Thermoworks Thermapen One</h2><p></p><p>Over the years, a Thermapen has become my most-used grilling tool. I rely on it like a sous chef to make sure I\u2019m cooking things to the correct temperature, especially chicken. It\u2019s a versatile tool at the grill and in the kitchen. ThermoWorks' <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8ec42127-5c25-4160-a755-9edb36e27b1b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=ThermoWorks&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4ZWM0MjEyNy01YzI1LTQxNjAtYTc1NS05ZWRiMzZlMjdiMWIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlcm1vd29ya3MuY29tL3RoZXJtYXBlbi1vbmUvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3NzBlM2YwZi1kNTczLTM1YjQtYmFmNy02NzExOGQ0N2E1ZmQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAaga3aSO_DiG9sWk_mFdWFcwY2u1QIwaLZ0DkYjYOJ85&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thermoworks.com%2Fthermapen-one%2F\">Thermapen One</a> is the follow up to its massively popular Thermapen Mk4. This new model shows temps lightning quick, giving you a reading in one second. ThermoWorks also improved accuracy and used a brighter display than the previous model. An automatically rotating screen makes the numbers easy to see no matter how you hold it, plus an auto-wake and sleep feature preserves battery life and IP67 rating protects it from accidental spills.</p><h2><strong>Meater Plus</strong></h2><p></p><p>A wireless meat thermometer may seem like overkill when there are so many great (and affordable) wired options available. I too was skeptical at first, but I can assure you that not having to avoid those metal cables when you\u2019re flipping or wrapping a large cut of meat is definitely worth the investment.

Each probe has two sensors, so you can keep tabs on both internal food temp and the ambient temperature of your grill. Stats are sent to the company\u2019s app, and you can set target temps, view an estimated completion time or get some help with a cook if you need it.</p><h2>Anova Precision Cooker Nano 3.0</h2><p></p><p>The latest version of Anova\u2019s Precision Cooker Nano still offers sous vide in a compact form factor. It\u2019s an updated version of the device I\u2019ve been using for a long time thanks most to its accuracy and reliability. The company has swapped Bluetooth connectivity for dual-band WiFi so you can venture further away from the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=ce1fdbb0-87c7-4856-a25a-d4bfd4a8b910&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Anova+Culinary&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjZTFmZGJiMC04N2M3LTQ4NTYtYTI1YS1kNGJmZDRhOGI5MTAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9hbm92YWN1bGluYXJ5LmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0cy9hbm92YS1wcmVjaXNpb24tY29va2VyLW5hbm8tMyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNzcwZTNmMGYtZDU3My0zNWI0LWJhZjctNjcxMThkNDdhNWZkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAWzLclrAZYzNouP6ntRP4NYvHiclp57i37i_sKBU-DJk&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fanovaculinary.com%2Fproducts%2Fanova-precision-cooker-nano-3\">Nano 3.0</a>. This model also has a two-line touchscreen display, so time and temperature can be viewed simultaneously. Manual controls are ever present here too, if you want to bypass the iOS or Android apps. That software will provide you with recipes and step-by-step guidance, so it\u2019s good to consult it even if you\u2019re experienced with this cooking method.</p><p>In order to make the most of your sous vide setup, you\u2019ll want to also invest in a vacuum sealer. I have the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Gb29kU2F2ZXItRk0yMDAwLU1hY2hpbmUtU3RhcnRlci1DZXJ0aWZpZWQvZHAvQjAxRDVUTUJFMD90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby11Mi0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNzcwZTNmMGYtZDU3My0zNWI0LWJhZjctNjcxMThkNDdhNWZkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAQS2Rwktsr_B9EeOTE4eXtVxzj6xvX38m7BfdRPHCpd9&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFoodSaver-FM2000-Machine-Starter-Certified%2Fdp%2FB01D5TMBE0\">FoodSaver FM2000</a>. It doesn\u2019t have some of the flashy features of more expensive units, but it covers the basics just fine. If you prefer something more robust with options like automatic bag detection, retractable handheld sealer and a dry/moist setting, I\u2019d recommend the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Gb29kU2F2ZXItVjQ0NDAtQXV0b21hdGljLURldGVjdGlvbi1DZXJ0aWZpZWQvZHAvQjAwREkzNDJCND90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby11Mi0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNzcwZTNmMGYtZDU3My0zNWI0LWJhZjctNjcxMThkNDdhNWZkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAATAoqpg-fCggIU0Hr5acSnJASH3lOLTM712H28jFwzOX&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFoodSaver-V4440-Automatic-Detection-Certified%2Fdp%2FB00DI342B4\">FoodSaver V4400</a>. With both, you can use them to seal leftovers for the freezer or store other goods you don\u2019t want air to get to in addition to sous vide cooking. I\u2019ve also found vacuum-sealed packs handy for reheating things like pulled pork. When you reheat with a sous vide, the meat doesn\u2019t dry out like it would in the microwave. Sure, you could just use Ziploc bags, but I\u2019ve done that, and a FoodSaver is worth the investment.</p><h2>Stanley IceFlow Tumblers</h2><p></p><p>I\u2019d argue one of the most important grilling tools is a cold beverage. And as the days get hotter, you\u2019ll need to plan your drinkware carefully so your monster cocktail or water supply remains at a frigid temperature. I\u2019ve tried a number of insulated aluminum cups over the years, but Stanley has been the best. The company is known for its classic thermos, but its lineup of cups, bottles and more are affordable and do a great job of keeping drinks cold for hours at a time.</p><p>Stanley has a ton of options that serve as alternatives to popular brands like Yeti, but the <a href=\"https://fave.co/2TgQcqC\">IceFlow Tumblers</a> have been my go-to this spring. The larger 30-ounce cup can keep drinks cold for up to 12 hours while the 20-ounce version can do so for up to seven hours. There\u2019s a solid handle and the built-in flip-down straw means the drinking area isn\u2019t exposed to the elements quite as much. At $25 and $30 each, these are a fraction of the cost of the most expensive options, and they have better ice retention than some of those too.</p><h2><strong>Brumate Hopsulator Duo and Trio</strong></h2><p></p><p>Brumate\u2019s Hopsulator products are warm weather essentials for me.

The tech giant said that coding has been one of its users' top requests, and now it has <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/ai/code-with-bard/\">given Bard the ability</a> to generate, debug and explain code. Bard can now write in 20 programming languages, including C++, Java, JavaScript and Python.

It could be especially useful if you've only just started learning programming, since it will show you why a particular block has the output that it has. And yes, Bard can now also help you debug code that isn't quite working like you want it to.&nbsp;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Google admits that at this point, Bard might spit out code that &quot;doesn\u2019t produce the expected output&quot; or code that's incomplete.

In fact, Bard can debug its own output if you find that it's returning an error \u2014 just type in &quot;this code didn\u2019t work, please fix it.&quot; Finally, if you're not a programming beginner but still need a help of help, you can ask the chatbot to optimize your code by making it faster or more efficient.</p><figure><img alt=\"A screenshot showing how Google Bard can help you debug code.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/ce26c3e0-e03c-11ed-abf7-99c667482892\" style=\"height: 983px; width: 1000px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Google</div></figure><p>The tech giant <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-is-opening-up-access-to-its-bard-ai-chatbot-today-140047434.html\">opened up access</a> to its AI chatbot in March, though it still has a ways to go to reach the popularity that ChatGPT is enjoying today.
