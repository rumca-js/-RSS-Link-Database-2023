Din Djarin and Din Grogu living that quiet life on Nevarro. For once, our heroes get a pretty happy ending and IGN host Max Scoville is here to break down why that ending is a huge part of what makes The Mandalorian so special. 

The Mandalorian is wrapped once again after The Mandalorian Season 3 finale! Star Wars of the current era is largely built around our titular Mandalorian; season 3 leaves us in a place we didn’t necessarily think of, be we’re still got our “The Mandalorian” reaction ready for you.

The Mandalorian and Grogu decide they have to face Moff Gideon or he’ll just keep coming, so The Mandalorian Season 3 Episode 8 finale episode is where they stood him down. Bo Katan also reaches a milestone from her story spanning several Disney Plus shows, but don’t worry, the focus is on “baby Yoda” (Grogu) and Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal). The Mandalorian Season 3 Finale shows us what a “good” ending is for the main characters, and it involves the glory of the Darksaber and the Mandalorian Mythosaur less than you might expect.

We’ve got our predictions for the Mythosaur, and why it’ll be important well beyond The Mandalorian season 3 episode 8 (unlike maybe, The Praetorian Guards). Axe Woves character gets more development, we have thoughts on what’s going on with Moff Gideon- light cruiser and all- as well as what’s next for Mandalore and The Great Forge! What do you think is the next chapter of the story?

## Dredge Video Review

Dredge reviewed by Gabriel Moss on PlayStation 5. Also available on PC, Switch, Xbox, and PS4.
Dredge erupted out of the left field as 2023’s most unforgettably creepy fishing simulator. Without spoiling anything, its slow dive into Lovecraftian horror intermingles with subtle elements of seabound thrillers like Jaws and Moby Dick, and yet despite its twists, its fishing and sailing mechanics are simple enough to be relaxing – just as long as you don’t stay out past dark. Its colorful graphics, intelligent story, and seafaring sound design are alluring, but calling it a management sim betrays how simple and approachable it is. Though it still may not excite anyone in search of abyssal depths, its world map, upgrade tree, and story offer more than enough interesting decisions of their own to make a 12-hour fishing expedition feel concise. At the same time, a lack of combat and meaningful customization give little weight to its excessive grinding, and these are clear opportunities for improvement on the next voyage.

Both systems are getting some important—and console-exclusive—games this summer, like Redfall and Diablo 4 for Xbox, and Final Fantasy XVI for PS5. And let's not forget about Nintendo, whose last-gen Switch is getting arguably its biggest and most important game: The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. The hype around that game is so huge, it might even eclipse the exclusives for the other current-gen consoles. Plus we have last week's poll results, and a new poll for you to vote on at IGN.com.

Disney Speedstorm Early Access reviewed by Luke Reilly on PC. Also available on PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch.

"Disney Speedstorm in Early Access is a fundamentally good kart racer that’s currently too light on tracks and too repetitive to warrant the required investment. Worse still, it’s buried beneath a veritable Splash Mountain of gacha garbage and so many discrete currencies that do different things that it almost seems like a parody of the entire free-to-play genre. Nothing sucks like gacha, plucks your bucks like gacha, makes you jump through hoops for Donald Duck like gacha."
