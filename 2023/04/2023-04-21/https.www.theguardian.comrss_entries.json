(Yes, sure, they won 2-1 away to 10th-placed Fulham, but that\u2019s got nothing to do with the narrative we\u2019re peddling here.) Six games, six defeats, 25 goals conceded and a general acceptance that United can\u2019t handle football\u2019s hotter kitchens.

Ever since I was a teen gobbling up Scream, Friday the 13th and Final Destination at sleepovers, I\u2019ve always found a good horror film to be one of life\u2019s little pleasures, like an early finish on a Friday or a Double Big Mac.</p><p>Of course, horror has got more high-concept in recent years, from Ari Aster\u2019s artfully nightmarish flicks Midsommar and Hereditary to the work of one Jordan Peele. Often, such films are described as \u201celevated horror\u201d, a term which has become popular in recent times and tends to refer to films which tackle contemporary social issues in arthouse fashion as well as scaring us witless.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/apr/21/the-guide-horror-films-scream-vi-evil-dead-rise\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/apr/21/the-guide-horror-films-scream-vi-evil-dead-rise", "date_published": "2023-04-21 10:45:09+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Spotlight turns to what Rishi Sunak knew about Dominic Raab and when", "description": "<p>PM is loyal towards his former deputy but it is hard to see how Raab\u2019s reputation could have escaped notice</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/apr/21/dominic-raab-bullying-report-rishi-sunak-tories-uk-politics-latest-news\">UK politics live \u2013 latest updates</a></li></ul><p>It took Rishi Sunak hours of agonising until he finally made the call that Dominic Raab could not stay in his job.

The first is the increased dominance of Britain in the transatlantic slave trade. According to estimates from the <a href=\"https://slavevoyages.org/\">Slave Voyages database</a>, the number of enslaved people carried by British ships more than doubled, from around 410,000 in the first quarter of the century to more than 830,000 in the third. The second is the establishment of William Shakespeare as the national bard. As scholar Gary Taylor puts it, \u201cShakespeare\u2019s coronation as the King of English poets\u201d dates from the third quarter of the 18th century, boosted by the actor David Garrick\u2019s lavish Shakespeare Jubilee celebrations in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1769.</p><p>These stories have their meeting point in one specific object: the valuable book known as Shakespeare\u2019s First Folio, published 400 years ago in 1623.

Taking in its cropped horns and the spears jammed into its back, you know something is wrong. This creature, Trico \u2026 it is feral, it is feared. And yet, you must care for it.
