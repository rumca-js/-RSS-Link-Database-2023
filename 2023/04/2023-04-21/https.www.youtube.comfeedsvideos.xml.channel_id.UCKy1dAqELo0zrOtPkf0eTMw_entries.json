For once, our heroes get a pretty happy ending and IGN host Max Scoville is here to break down why that ending is a huge part of what makes The Mandalorian so special. \n\nThe Mandalorian is wrapped once again after The Mandalorian Season 3 finale! Star Wars of the current era is largely built around our titular Mandalorian; season 3 leaves us in a place we didn\u2019t necessarily think of, be we\u2019re still got our \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d reaction ready for you.\n\nThe Mandalorian and Grogu decide they have to face Moff Gideon or he\u2019ll just keep coming, so The Mandalorian Season 3 Episode 8 finale episode is where they stood him down. Bo Katan also reaches a milestone from her story spanning several Disney Plus shows, but don\u2019t worry, the focus is on \u201cbaby Yoda\u201d (Grogu) and Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal). The Mandalorian Season 3 Finale shows us what a \u201cgood\u201d ending is for the main characters, and it involves the glory of the Darksaber and the Mandalorian Mythosaur less than you might expect.\n\nWe\u2019ve got our predictions for the Mythosaur, and why it\u2019ll be important well beyond The Mandalorian season 3 episode 8 (unlike maybe, The Praetorian Guards). Axe Woves character gets more development, we have thoughts on what\u2019s going on with Moff Gideon- light cruiser and all- as well as what\u2019s next for Mandalore and The Great Forge! What do you think is the next chapter of the story? \n\nSubscribe to IGN for more!\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/IGNentertainment?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#ign#starwars#themandalorian#themandalorianseason3", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRM_vlj1DkA", "date_published": "2023-04-21 20:00:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Warframe: The Duviri Paradox - Official Release Date Trailer", "description": "Warframe is a cooperative, free-to-play third-person looter shooter set in a constantly evolving sci-fi universe.

Without spoiling anything, its slow dive into Lovecraftian horror intermingles with subtle elements of seabound thrillers like Jaws and Moby Dick, and yet despite its twists, its fishing and sailing mechanics are simple enough to be relaxing \u2013 just as long as you don\u2019t stay out past dark. Its colorful graphics, intelligent story, and seafaring sound design are alluring, but calling it a management sim betrays how simple and approachable it is. Though it still may not excite anyone in search of abyssal depths, its world map, upgrade tree, and story offer more than enough interesting decisions of their own to make a 12-hour fishing expedition feel concise.
