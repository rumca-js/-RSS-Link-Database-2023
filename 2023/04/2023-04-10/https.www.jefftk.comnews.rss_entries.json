[{"source": "https://www.jefftk.com/news.rss", "title": "Outrage and Statistics into Policy", "description": "<p><span>\n\nHere's a pattern that doesn't work very well: a tragedy catches our\nattention, we point to statistics to show it's an example of a\ndistressingly common problem, and we propose laws to address the\nissue.  Except the event is rarely representative of the larger\nproblem, and so these policy changes won't help much with the issues\nreflected in the statistics.  Instead, we should combine the anger and\npassion the tragedy evokes with a deeper interpretation of the\nstatistics to identify what changes we most need.\n\n</span>\n\n<p>\n\nFor example, with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Covenant_School_shooting\">recent\nNashville school shooting</a> a lot of people are giving statistics\nlike how there were <a href=\"https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/past-tolls\">600+ mass\nshootings</a> and <a href=\"https://www.edweek.org/leadership/school-shootings-this-year-how-many-and-where/2022/01\">51\nschool shootings</a> in 2022, or how guns are now the <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2023/04/06/gun-deaths-among-us-kids-rose-50-percent-in-two-years/\">largest\ncause of death for children</a>.  But let's look into the kind of\nevents these statistics represent.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe Gun Violence Archive maintains a <a href=\"https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/reports/mass-shooting\">listing\nof mass shootings</a>: incidents in which at least four people are\nshot.  They link news stories for each, and while they're frustrating\nand depressing they're very rarely \"someone senselessly shoots up an\nelementary school\".  Instead they're people fighting and one of them\n<a href=\"https://www.live5news.com/2023/04/08/2-arrests-made-after-iop-beach-shooting-city-council-holds-emergency-meeting/\">pulls\nout a gun</a>, people arguing at a park and then escalating to <a href=\"https://www.fox8live.com/2023/04/07/4-shot-including-2-juveniles-i-10-new-orleans-east/\">shooting\non the highway</a>, or a targeted attack <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/news/philadelphia-shooting-kensington-rorer-street/\">at\na garage</a>.  In half of the incidents exactly four people are shot,\nsince most shootings are fewer people and the cutoff is four.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nEducation Week maintains a <a href=\"https://www.edweek.org/leadership/school-shootings-this-year-how-many-and-where/2022/01\">listing\nof school shootings</a>: incidents in which at least one person is\nshot on school property or a school bus.  Looking over them they're\nagain mostly not the kind that makes national news.  Two\nteenagers fighting in the schoolyard and one of them <a href=\"http://pgpolice.blogspot.com/2022/12/teenage-suspect-wanted-for-shooting-at.html\">has\na gun</a>, a drug deal between two armed people in a school parking\nlot <a href=\"https://www.kalb.com/2022/11/15/2-people-shot-near-camp-livingston-road-ball/\">escalates\ninto a shooting</a>, or an adult was shot in their car in the school\nparking lot <a href=\"https://www.wlbt.com/2022/11/12/hinds-county-deputies-investigate-shooting-parking-lot-after-raymond-high-basketball-game/\">after\na basketball game</a>.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIf you look at the Nashville school shooting, or others that have made\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting\">especially\nlarge</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robb_Elementary_School_shooting\">impacts\nnationally</a>, they're attacks against younger kids.  And hearing the\n\"number one cause of death among children\" statistic you might think\nthis is common.  But \"children\" here is being used literally to mean\n\"under 18\": 47% of those dying were 17, and 76% were 16 or 17. Only\n18% were under 15:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/firearm-homicide-rate-by-age-big.png\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"413\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/firearm-homicide-rate-by-age.png\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n<i>Source: CDC, <a href=\"https://github.com/jeffkaufman/firearm-deaths\">code</a></i>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nNone of this is to minimize the suffering and loss these shootings\nrepresent: ten incidents in which four people die isn't better than\none in which forty die, and someone dying at 17 isn't more acceptable\nthan dying at 9.  All of these deaths are too many.  But if we're\ngoing to make things better, we need to target our responses to the\ncommon cases, and not the unusual ones that make the news.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nHere's the demographic breakdown:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/firearm-homicide-rate-by-age-and-race-and-gender-big.png\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"413\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/firearm-homicide-rate-by-age-and-race-and-gender.png\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nAnd as a proportion of deaths at each age:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/firearm-homicide-death-fraction-rate-by-age-and-race-and-gender-big.png\"><img class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" height=\"413\" src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/firearm-homicide-death-fraction-rate-by-age-and-race-and-gender.png\" width=\"550\" /><div class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThat the impact of these shootings so strongly reinforces existing\ndisadvantage makes the misplaced focus especially tragic.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nTranslating this into policies, the <a href=\"https://www.theolympian.com/news/politics-government/article274115110.html\">efforts</a>\nto re-ban <a href=\"https://joebiden.com/gunsafety/\">assault rifles</a>\ndon't make sense: gun homicides are overwhelmingly from handguns.\nSame with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_flag_law\">red\nflag laws</a>, where a judge can order someone's guns confiscated,\nsince most of the homicides are via illegally possessed guns which\ncould already be confiscated.  An approach of <a href=\"https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-illegally-carried-handguns-are\">enforcing\nexisting laws on handgun possession</a>, however, making it less likely that\nteenagers and young adults who get into fights will be armed, is the\nkind of policy that fits the bulk of the problem, and sounds much more\nlikely to make an impact.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid0Kb9MoFEktp4weZ3FEKkWKoymHA2SDShRszw9bR3ENGVdgdPWaWAr4CRkYDbF24oZl\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://lesswrong.com/posts/Cu3SrLfQtCfAPKWEz\">lesswrong</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@jefftk/110174884364403179\">mastodon</a></i></p>", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/outrage-and-statistics-into-policy", "date_published": "2023-04-10 08:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
