Thanks to OriginPC for sponsoring today's video! Win your very own ChronosV3 Desktop PC challenge-free at https://www.originpc.com/landing/2023/linus-chronos-giveaway/ (Link will be live soon!)

Origin PC sent us a white Chronos V3 gaming pc complete with an Intel i9-13900K process and an RTX 4080 GPU, but they told us we weren’t allowed to keep it. Of course, we don’t plan to give it back to them either, so we broke it good and invited our subscriber Calvin down to try to fix it. We told him he’d get to keep this beautiful, compact gaming rig IF he could get it in working order in under 2 hours. Will he succeed, or will we have to find someone else to take this compact ivory obelisk off our hands?
