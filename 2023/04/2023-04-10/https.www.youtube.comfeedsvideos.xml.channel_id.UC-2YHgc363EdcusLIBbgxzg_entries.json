Go to http://www.thatjoescott.com/madness to vote!\nChemical rockets have made it possible for us to launch satellites into orbit and land humans on the moon, but if we want to go further, into the solar system and beyond, we'll need a different kind of engine, and NASA has recently partnered with DARPA to build a new nuclear thermal propulsion engine named DRACO. If successful, it could change the trajectory of our future in space.\n\nSee my full reaction to the Sketch Madness results on my second channel: https://youtu.be/eZLUzVkv8yo\n\nAnd go vote in the Quarterfinal round at www.thatjoescott.com/madness\n\n\nWant to support the channel?
