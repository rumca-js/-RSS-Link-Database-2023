Peterson and Miriam Grossman discuss the grief and trauma associated with the Transgender movement, not just for those transitioning, but for the parents and family who now find themselves shunned and alienated if they refuse to affirm their own child's delusion. They also go into detail on the history of the ideology, the monstrosity of Dr. John Money, and his horrendous failed experiment for which he built his doctrines on.\n\nMiriam Grossman MD is a physician, author, and public speaker.  Before gender ideology was on anyone\u2019s radar, she warned parents about its dangers in her 2009 book, \u201cYou\u2019re Teaching My Child WHAT?\u201d Dr. Grossman has been vocal for many years about the capture of her profession by ideologues, leading to dangerous and experimental treatments on children and betrayal of parents. Dr. Grossman was featured in the Daily Wire\u2019s hit documentary \u201cWhat Is A Woman?\u201d The author of four books, her work has been translated into eleven languages. After graduating with honors from Bryn Mawr College, Dr Grossman attended New York University Medical School.  She completed an internship in pediatrics at Beth Israel Hospital in New York City, and a residency in psychiatry through Cornell University Medical College, followed by a fellowship in child and adolescent psychiatry. Dr. Grossman is board certified in psychiatry and in the sub-specialty of child and adolescent psychiatry.\n\nDr Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8\n\n\n- Sponsors -\n\nBirch Gold Group: Text \"JORDAN\" to 989898 for your no-cost, no-obligation, FREE information kit.\n\nHallow: Try Hallow for 3 months FREE: https://hallow.com/jordan\n\nExpressVPN: Get 3 Months FREE of ExpressVPN: https://expressvpn.com/jordan\n\n\n- Links -\n\nFor Miriam Grossman MD:\n\nLost in TransNation (Book) - https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Trans-Nation-Psychiatrists-Madness/dp/1510777741 \n\nYou\u2019re Teaching My Child WHAT?
