So much for after the lord mayor’s show.</p><p>The reason for this anomaly, of course, can be found in the multiple kitchen sinks the Tour threw at leading players in order to prevent a talent drain to LIV Golf.

## Utopia in corduroy concrete: the mesmerising architecture of a Mexican master

<p>Guadalajara is often seen as a place of tequila and mariachi music. Can Alejandro Zohn, whose buildings include a market roofed by giant shells, make it famous for architecture?</p><p>A miniature billboard pokes up above the neatly trimmed hedge in the garden of the Schindler House in Los Angeles, as if a roadside ad had blown in from nearby Sunset Strip. Cantilevered from a chunky steel column, strapped to a base of pink concrete blocks, it is a startling arrival on the grounds of this hallowed modernist sanctuary. It’s particularly strange as the hoarding in question is not advertising injury law or a Hollywood movie about a coked-up bear, but a 1970s public housing project in the Mexican city of Guadalajara.<br /><br />“The billboards are trying to make trouble,” says Mimi Zeiger, co-curator of an exhibition here about the work of Mexican-Austrian architect <a href="https://www.makcenter.org/exhibitions/seeking-zohn">Alejandro Zohn</a>. She gestures to a range of hoarding structures scattered around the garden of the famous house, like fragments of a more brash urban realm impinging on the quiet oasis, each displaying an image of Zohn’s work. “It’s a way to bring the scale of the city into the more secluded, domestic space, creating a bridge between Guadalajara and LA.”<br /><br />The bold signs are a provocative addition to the West Hollywood sanctum built by Austrian émigré architect Rudolph Schindler in 1922 and often regarded as the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/celebrating-the-centennial-of-arguably-the-worlds-first-modern-house-in-west-hollywood">Ur-monument of southern California modernism</a>. The house was designed after Schindler and his wife spent the summer in a cabin in Yosemite national park, and it embodies his desire to channel the sense of camping out in nature in the form of a bohemian shack.</p><p>For all the sanctity heaped on it since, the house is a refreshingly rough and ready thing, built on a shoestring. A poured concrete slab serves as both the foundation and finished floor surface, <a href="http://kingsroadhouse.blogspot.com/2012/12/the-construction_9.html">on which the walls were cast flat then hauled up into place</a>, topped with a simple redwood roof, with big canvas panels that slide open to the garden. It is a poetically primitive place, exuding the excitement of outdoor living from someone freshly arrived from colder climes – complete with “sleeping baskets” on the roof (on the assumption that LA was warm enough to spend nights outside. They soon found it wasn’t.)<br /><br />Since the 1990s, the house has been home to the <a href="https://www.makcenter.org/schindler-house">MAK Center for Art and Architecture</a>, an outpost of the Museum of Applied Arts in Vienna, hosting a programme that explores the intersection of the two disciplines, while always being careful not to screw anything into the precious walls (the property is owned and maintained by local non-profit, Friends of the Schindler House). It is a fine balancing act of keeping the house sparse enough for the pilgrims who come to worship the purity of the architecture, while injecting enough variety to keep local audiences coming back.<br /><br />The choice of Zohn is an inspired one. Like Schindler, he was a Jewish émigré to the Americas – his parents fled Vienna in 1939 when he was eight – and a prolific architect, with around 500 projects to his name, yet he remains virtually unknown outside Mexico. Unlike Luis Barragán or Félix Candela, icons of mid-century modernism whose photogenic work travelled widely, Zohn was a generation later (he died in 2000), and was based in the western city of Guadalajara – often regarded by Mexico City’s taste-making elite as a provincial place of tequila and mariachi music.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/10/alejandro-zohn-guadalajara-mexican">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Mark Rowley wants new powers to sack officers – but the more difficult task will be transforming the force’s internal culture</p><p>Sir Mark Rowley joined the police a decade after the departure of Sir Robert Mark, the former Met commissioner whose campaign against a culture of corruption led to an exodus of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/oct/01/sir-robert-mark-obituary" title="">478 police officers</a>. Nearly 40 years later, the culture is still rotten. With Sir Mark now at its helm, the Met has been found institutionally racist, misogynistic and homophobic. Transforming it will be an uphill battle and an even bigger challenge than that faced by Sir Robert. Corruption in the Met today is less about back-handed bribes than widespread tolerance of behaviours that could threaten the very existence of the force.</p><p>Sir Mark intends to start by sacking officers. Last week, he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/09/dont-delay-moves-to-clean-up-met-police-sadiq-khan-tells-suella-braverman" title="">wrote to Suella Braverman and Sadiq Khan</a> calling for new powers to do so. The Met is prevented from directly firing officers by a requirement that misconduct hearings be heard by an independent chair. The Home Office is currently reviewing this system, but changes should be approached carefully: as the president of the body that represents tribunal chairs <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m001kwtq" title="">pointed out</a> on Monday, the current rules were introduced in 2015 to make the process more open. Returning to the old system, where hearings were private, would not bring more transparency. Instead, the Home Office should heed Louise Casey’s advice and give chief constables the right to appeal tribunal decisions to reinstate officers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/10/the-guardian-view-on-the-met-police-change-will-be-an-uphill-battle">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Other regions would benefit from a similar levy in the interests of sustainable tourism</p><p>Valencia will introduce one by the beginning of next year. Bologna <a href="https://www.italyvacations.com/tourist-city-taxes-italy" title="">charges</a> €4 a night, about average for an Italian city, and French resorts have been able to impose a <em>taxe de séjour</em> since 1910. But local authorities in Britain have consistently wavered when it comes to imposing a tourist tax similar to those <a href="https://www.euronews.com/travel/2023/03/28/this-uk-city-will-soon-charge-tourist-tax-where-else-in-europe-do-you-have-to-pay-to-visit" title="">commonplace</a> in the rest of Europe. In recent years Oxford, Bath and Hull reportedly contemplated a levy but decided against it.</p><p>At the start of this month, however – in time for the Easter bank holiday weekend – Manchester finally took the plunge, after winning surprisingly strong backing from the city’s hoteliers. Visitors staying in a Manchester city centre hotel or holiday apartment are now required to pay a £1 per night City Visitor Charge. An estimated £3m worth of annual revenue will be dedicated to tourism-related and cultural projects, as well as more mundane necessities such as street cleaning. The Welsh government is <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-65121438" title="">preparing</a> to follow suit, giving councils power to institute a levy to pay towards the upkeep of beaches, parks, pavements and footpaths. Edinburgh is reportedly considering a £2 a night tourist tax, subject to approval from the Scottish parliament.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/10/the-guardian-view-on-manchesters-tourist-tax-blazing-a-trail">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Readers are unimpressed by Keir Starmer’s strategy of personal attacks against the prime minister</p><p>As someone who led BBC News, Newsnight and Today teams through the spin battles in the 1990s, I share Marina Hyde’s shock at the tactics the Labour leader now uses to attack Rishi Sunak (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/07/keir-starmer-high-horse-politics-labour-rishi-sunak" title="">What was that dreadful thud? The sound of Keir Starmer falling off his high horse, 7 April</a>). As a party member, in 2020 I voted for Keir Starmer. He seemed a man who’d tell the truth, stick by his word and offer a generous vision of Britain’s future. Sadly, that brave vision never materialised. Instead, within weeks he’d abandoned many of the manifesto promises on which he’d been elected. And then, despite having led a campaign for a second referendum, he shut down talk of a Labour government ever rejoining the single market. Did any solid core of belief exist under the lawyerly caution?</p><p>Now he goes several steps further in personal attacks on Rishi Sunak that might make even Boris Johnson blush. These attack ads are simple lies about a new prime minister’s personal beliefs. Did Keir Hardie, Clement Attlee, Harold Wilson, Neil Kinnock, Tony Blair or Gordon Brown ever stoop so low?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/apr/10/labours-advert-attacking-rishi-sunak-is-a-new-low-for-the-party">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Dr Stephen Vallely </strong>lends his support to junior doctors who are striking this week to highlight dangerous staffing levels</p><p>Your article (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/apr/04/critically-ill-patients-inevitably-die-junior-doctors-strike" title="">Critically ill patients ‘will inevitably die’ due to junior doctors’ strike, 4 April</a>) is based on the views of three, admittedly eminent, cardiac doctors, but totally misses the point. Critically ill patients are dying every day because of the reckless underfunding of our health service by consecutive governments of whatever shade.</p><p>What the “junior” doctors – a phrase I despise to refer to individuals who have often dedicated 20-plus years to the health service – are trying to highlight is the dangerous staffing levels that the public are forced to experience in hospitals all over the UK, where patients with potential cancers wait for scans weeks beyond what they should have to, and the standard of care is, at best, barely tolerable. They are highlighting the fact that patients are dying needlessly every day.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/apr/10/nhs-underfunding-is-causing-patient-deaths-not-doctors-strikes">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Nigerian winger was unstoppable against Real Madrid and is approaching his peak after a long, hard journey to Spain</p><p>His boots are on fire, and not for the first time. When Samuel Chimerenka Chukwueze was a boy growing up in Umahia, southeast Nigeria, all he wanted to do was play football but his mum had other ideas. The way he recalls it, Sarah was so determined for him to become a doctor, and for sport not to get in the way of school work, that one time he came home to find that she had burned all his kit. That day, he cried; on Saturday, he laughed his head off, live on TV. “It’s a mad <em>golazo</em>, isn’t it?” he said, and then he cracked up.</p><p>It certainly is, Samu. Ten minutes remained at the Santiago Bernabéu when he received the ball on the right one last time. Before him, poor Nacho Fernández, whose insides still hadn’t straightened out, unravelling the knots the Nigerian spent the evening tying them in, must have felt his heart sink. Chukwueze rolled the ball under his studs, headed for him, neatly evaded Eduardo Camavinga and gave it to Álex Baena, which might have been a relief to Real Madrid, except Chukwueze got it straight back and then broke them again. For good this time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/10/samuel-chukwuezes-cartoon-golazo-seals-his-place-as-villarreals-new-hero">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Exclusive: EMFS, devised by Treasury and Bank of England as backstop fund, was quietly closed this year</p><p>The Treasury spent almost half a million pounds on an unused emergency scheme for energy traders launched by Liz Truss that was quietly closed earlier this year.<br /><br />The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/oct/17/uk-energy-firms-energy-markets-financing-scheme-emfs">energy markets financing scheme (EMFS)</a> was devised by the Treasury and the Bank of England as a £40bn government-guaranteed backstop fund to provide stability for energy and financial markets.<br /><br />The scheme was designed to offer energy traders liquidity to deal with massive margin calls – demands from brokers to deposit further cash or securities to cover possible losses – but was shut in January as a sharp fall in wholesale gas prices earlier this year eased pressure on energy firms.<br /><br />In response to a freedom of information request by the Guardian, the Treasury said it spent £465,000 on “external technical consultants to support the creation of the EMFS”.<br /><br />It said that 11 commercial banks and 20 energy firms were invited to technical video calls with the Treasury relating to the scheme. Energy firms would have applied jointly with a bank but no applications were made during a window from October to late January.<br /><br />FTI Consulting, the global management consultancy, received £400,000 for its advisory role, while the law firm Hogan Lovells received £65,000.<br /><br />The government contract was originally worth up to £4.9m for FTI to provide market research and consultancy services, <a href="https://client.tussell.com/award_notices/742347-f52b261776d7cc83c07c0f4c3d9e77ee-provision-of-business-economic-analysis-services">according to analysis by the data firm Tussell</a>. <br /><br />Truss announced the scheme in September <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/08/liz-truss-energy-bills-plan-key-points">as part of a package of measures</a> to prevent the energy crisis causing further damage during the winter. The then prime minister also announced support for households and businesses, both of those schemes were later pared back to reduce the cost.<br /><br />The Treasury said: “The scheme was introduced as part of a range of contingency measures to support the energy sector.<br /><br />“Since the launch of the scheme prices in the wholesale gas markets have declined markedly and this has reduced some of the pressure facing eligible energy firms.”<br /><br />It added: “Due to improvements in market conditions since the launch of the scheme, energy firms were able to access the necessary lines of credit from commercial lenders without the need for the government-backed guarantee.<br /><br />“The EMFS was designed to supplement existing commercial financing where this alone was not sufficient with penal pricing and conditions upon drawdown set so it would only be used if commercial and competitively priced financing was unavailable on the market. It was not intended to replace commercial lending.”<br /><br />The Bank of England refused to state how much it spent on its part in the creation of the EMFS.<br /><br />Industry sources said that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/oct/17/uk-energy-firms-energy-markets-financing-scheme-emfs">strict conditions</a> preventing companies paying bonuses to executives or dividends to shareholders after using the scheme had also deterred energy companies. <br /><br />The government’s spending on energy support schemes has been under intense scrutiny as households and businesses attempt to cope with the high bills inflated by the gas prices linked to the war in Ukraine.<br /><br />In his budget, Jeremy Hunt <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/15/jeremy-hunt-makes-u-turn-on-planned-cut-to-energy-bills-support">made a U-turn</a> on a plan to make household support less generous but has stuck with a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/09/business-energy-bill-support-to-be-reduced-from-march-treasury-confirms">cut in financial energy aid for businesses</a>, which began on 1 April.<br /><br />The support for firms <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/mar/23/a-third-of-care-homes-in-england-have-considered-closing-due-to-rising-energy-bills">has been labelled “scattergun” </a>by business groups, which have warned that many are now considering closure in the face of unaffordable bills.</p><p>Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of UKHospitality, which represents pubs, restaurants and hotels, said: “The significant reduction in energy support comes as a hammer blow to thousands of hospitality businesses that are already struggling with extortionate energy bills that are already double what they were a year ago.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/apr/10/uk-spent-almost-500000-on-unused-support-scheme-for-energy-firms">Continue reading...</a>

## Rishi Sunak as a paedophile-protecter? Attack ads are back - and they’re as daft as ever
 - [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/10/starmer-paedophile-attack](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/10/starmer-paedophile-attack)

<p>From Tony Blair as Bambi to William Hague with Thatcher’s hair, political adverts are often incredibly silly. So why do they keep getting made?</p><p>I have no strong views about Keir Starmer’s attack ad, in which he accuses Rishi Sunak of letting paedophiles walk free. I have managed to keep abreast of the objections, though. Some think he shouldn’t have personalised it, since Sunak has only been in parliament since 2015, and paedophiles have been walking free since, oh, ages before that. Others think that Starmer has opened the floodgates for the Conservatives to be extremely personal and vindictive against him. This is a rather quaint and sweet, and also stupid, view of the Tories, that they never say anything unfair until someone has hurt their feelings first.</p><p>The problem with personalised electioneering is not that it’s unfair – someone has to be held responsible for government decisions, and it may as well be the prime minister. No, it’s because it’s daft. Attack ads start off understood only by the four people in the room where they were devised. I bet even the graphic designer responsible for photoshopping Margaret Thatcher’s hair on to William Hague’s head in 2001 wasn’t completely sure what the point was – is he masquerading as Thatcher, but is actually different from her? Or is he pretending to be different, when he’s actually Thatcher 2.0? Or is it just better when prime ministers have hair?

<p>Meatless meatballs bursting with flavour, and bolognese with a lower meat content but all the texture and taste</p><p>In terms of sheer volume of DNA at least, farm animals could be seen as evolution’s biggest winners. There are currently about 80bn of them on this planet being reared for food, and their combined weight is more than twice that of the entire human race. But what a strange success this is: the lives of these animals are too often miserable and short, and the effects on the environment are disastrous. The single best thing each of us can do for the environment is to cut back on our meat consumption – and by at least 30%. If, like me, you have carnivorous children, you’ll need a few tricks up your sleeve.

<p>From his blistering drag act Lily Savage to programmes about dogs and his exceptional daytime TV show, the sheer strength of feeling that O’Grady inspired beats through in every frame</p><p>Paul O’Grady’s death came as a huge shock. If you didn’t feel that at the time, you almost certainly did during For the Love of Paul O’Grady, ITV’s tribute to the late comedian. The most scattershot, breakneck, flung-together hour of television you may ever watch, the show was, quite frankly, all over the place. It was unevenly structured, oddly paced and contained a bizarre framing device, in which edit points were covered with footage of dogs watching a television, one of whom posed mournfully next to a tissue box, making the whole thing look like an especially macabre canine-based obituary episode of Gogglebox. Clearly, ITV didn’t know this was coming any more than we did.</p><p>So with that in mind, it’s all the more remarkable that the show was as moving as it was. What beat through every frame was the sheer strength of feeling that O’Grady inspired, in his friends, colleagues and fans alike. I am deliberately trying to avoid using the word “love” here, because that doesn’t seem quite right. This was a man for whom a huge spectrum of people felt tangible affinity. They felt as if he belonged to them and them alone.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/10/for-the-love-of-paul-ogrady-review-breakneck-tribute-to-beloved-comedian-is-remarkably-moving">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A move to allow Australian psychiatrists to treat depression with psilocybin may herald a new era</p><p>So-called magic mushrooms (those that contain the molecule psilocybin) have been used by people around the world medicinally and ceremonially for a very long time. Rock art in Kimberley, Western Australia, that depicts mushroom-headed beings, suggests people were using them 10,000 years ago to attain trance-like states. Strikingly similar images have been found in the Sandawe paintings of eastern Tanzania and in the Algerian Sahara. Now, after decades of these hallucinogenic fungi being consigned to the grubby margins of illegality <strong>OR LEGALITY?</strong>, humans appear to be rediscovering their benefits.</p><p>From July, authorised psychiatrists in Australia will be permitted to prescribe psilocybin to patients with treatment-resistant depression. This hasn’t come out of the blue: the drug is a major ingredient in what has been dubbed the psychedelic renaissance – a resurgence of public interest and research in substances that began to be recognised for their medicinal qualities in the 1950s, before a wave of moral panic and irrational legislation placed them off-limits for years.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/10/the-big-idea-should-doctors-be-able-to-prescribe-psychedelics">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In the 1960s, Pat and Ann Samson used to go to Joan Eardley’s studio to eat cheese and treacle sandwiches by the fire – and be painted in now famous works. What happened to the girls? The maker of a new Radio Four show tracked them down</p><p>Pat Samson’s ginger hair needs a good brush and there’s a squint in her right eye. She’s smiling, bouncy almost, sitting with her hands in her lap, wearing a red frock and a pink cardigan. Beside her is her sister Ann, who looks more sombre, her lips closed over buck teeth. She’s in a white dress with yellow flowers. The pair, wearing clothes kept in a box by the woman painting them, are captured shoulder to shoulder, close – just as they are today.</p><p>Pat and Ann Samson are two of a family of 12 children who became subjects for the painter Joan Eardley, now recognised as one of the great talents of 20th-century Scottish art. Drawn to Glasgow’s Townhead area, and especially Rottenrow, where soot-covered, often overcrowded tenement buildings were awaiting demolition, Eardley found first a studio and then her subjects, the sparky “weans” who clattered round the streets and closes. These included the Samsons: seven boys and five girls.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/10/urchins-glasgow-tearaways-joan-eardley-painted-pat-ann-samson-radio-4">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As Respawn’s new game set in the Lucasfilm universe is released, director Stig Asmussen explains how it took a while to persuade its guardians that a Jedi is a game character </p><p>For almost a decade, my husband and I have had an annual tradition of setting aside a full day to watch all of the Star Wars films, back-to-back. When we first met, this was a six-film undertaking, or occasionally four, if we swapped the prequels for the fan-made Neon Noir edit. Now, a Star Wars marathon means making it through 11 films – sorry, Clone Wars fans – which is less a cosy day with snack breaks, and far more like a real marathon, complete with precisely timed bathroom breaks and energy gels for sustenance.</p><p>And, of course, this year’s traditional viewing came after we’d also devoured the first season of Andor, binged The Book of Boba Fett, been re-introduced to Obi-Wan Kenobi, and caught up on season three of The Mandalorian. Plus, we played through Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, and visited Galaxy’s Edge, the Star Wars themed world at Disneyland. Twice.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/apr/10/the-making-of-star-wars-jedi-survivor-lucasfilm-stig-asmussen">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With sights set on European glory, Great Britain’s high flyer is reaching new heights with the help of sports psychology</p><p>The balance beam is the destroyer of dreams. It exposes tension and nerves like no other apparatus, provoking falls from its knife-edge surface. For many years it betrayed British gymnasts in high pressure moments, but now they are increasingly at ease on it.</p><p>They are also, at times, even spectacular. Few routines in GB’s programme are as satisfying as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzOukIAChbo#t=44s">the daring combination executed by Alice Kinsella</a> on the beam. Early in her display, Kinsella launches herself into a no-hands cartwheel, which she immediately follows with two consecutive back somersaults with her body in a straight position.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/apr/10/it-feels-like-im-flying-gymnast-alice-kinsella-on-conquering-self-doubt">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As I approach my vintage years, why not spend life doing something I love – travelling and meeting new people</p><p>I am a former flight attendant with a passion for travel. My motto in life has always been to experience, learn and then grow.

I was the first person to sign up.</p><p>That may sound like a surprising decision, but I’ve never been one for a nine-to-five life. I retired in 1989, and since then have spent my days travelling. I’ve been on long trips before: I spent two and half months journeying from Mongolia to Jordan. But this will be the longest by far. It doesn’t faze me – once I embark on a trip, I could go on for ever. Despite spending decades in airports around the world, I don’t like them. Life onboard cruise ships, like Life at Sea’s MV Gemini, offers an opportunity to see the world without the threat of flight cancellations and long queues.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/10/first-person-three-year-cruise">Continue reading...</a>

The stakes were high: Wisconsin’s state legislature has been gerrymandered out of competitiveness for more than a decade, for one thing, meaning that the state, which has a roughly even split between Democratic and Republican voters, had nevertheless become a grim experiment in one-party rule, with Republicans commanding a majority of statehouse seats despite receiving far fewer votes proportionally. Federal elections in Wisconsin seemed worryingly vulnerable, too: when Trump sued over his 2020 loss there, making spurious claims of election fraud, the Republican-controlled state supreme court ruled against him by only one vote.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/10/republican-party-2024-divided">Continue reading...</a>

## The Pope’s Exorcist review – demonslayer-in-chief Russell Crowe has devil of a job

<p>The Exorcist rerun as a Tiktok video is a papal potboiler saved from eternal damnation by Crowe, who is no doubt eyeing a late-career franchise</p><p>Hustled out over Easter, Julius Avery’s papal potboiler derives brisk if well-trodden hokum from the writings of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/26/father-gabriele-amorth-obituary">Father Gabriele Amorth</a>, the Vatican’s demonslayer-in-chief between 1986 and 2016. The film’s Amorth is a wry old pro, finding the levity in a devilishly tricky day job; not unhelpfully, he’s played by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/russellcrowe">Russell Crowe</a>, alternating gruff Italian and Italianate English, and possibly eyeing the prospect of a late-career franchise-slash-retirement plan. Crowe is by far the film’s strongest suit, pre-empting (some of) our gigglier responses and mitigating against (some of) the material’s flimsiness. We still have movie stars, even if the pictures thrown up around them are getting smaller, staler and sillier.</p><p>Crowe’s Amorth is pulled away from Dan Brown-ish Vatican politicking to attend a gloomy San Sebastián abbey being renovated by single parent Julia (Alex Essoe). Here, things are going bump in the night, chiefly Julia’s son Henry (Peter DeSouza-Feighoney), possessed by a pesky demon who scratches “GOD IS NOT HERE” on his host’s chest, like an “I’m with stoopid”-style T-shirt slogan. Only Father Gabriele is a worthy enough opponent for this entity: propelling an earnest local cleric (Daniel Zovatto) across an adjoining corridor, Henry’s demon bellows: “Wrong fucking priest!” – with the voice of Finchy from The Office, for extra chuckles. The subsequent growl-off is like The Exorcist redone as a TikTok video.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/10/the-popes-exorcist-review-russell-crowe">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A city slicker moves his family to Alabama in search of a wholesome life and sets off for a solo hunting trip. It’s not going to go well</p><p>Robert Machoian is an indie film-maker drawn to a certain type of troubled American masculinity: the type that’s never so toxic as when weak or insecure. His previous drama <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jun/02/the-killing-of-two-lovers-review">The Killing of Two Lovers</a> was about male anger, and this tense, suspenseful new film has similar ideas: a Dostoevskian parable set over a single day in remote woodland, with a slow-moving simplicity that belies its storytelling ingenuity and force, and again featuring Machoian’s longtime collaborator, actor-producer Clayne Crawford. This actually looks as if it could have been conceived in the 1970s, with a hint of Boorman’s Deliverance: right down to the Burt Reynolds moustache that the male lead smugly sculpts for himself one morning in front of the shaving mirror, to his wife’s annoyance.</p><p>Crawford plays Joseph Chambers, a prosperous insurance salesman and Christian family man who has moved to rural Alabama with his wife Tess (Jordana Brewster) and their two boys, to find a more wholesome place away from the city for the children’s upbringing. But Joseph has got it into his head to have a day’s hunting on his own in some nearby woodland belonging to his friend Doug (Carl Kennedy), to learn some survival skills and generally prove his manhood. Tess, who grew up with a dad and brothers who hunted, and actually knows more about this kind of stuff than her naive city-slicker husband, is dead against him going on his own like this.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/10/the-integrity-of-joseph-chambers-review-tense-parable-of-troubled-masculinity">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The key to getting <em>pasta alla papalina</em> just right is the five-second wait before you add the cheese and egg …</p><p>For a while, I thought there was a recipe called <em>fettuccine alla pappardelle</em>. It was the result of me skimming through a book looking for something else. But like a dozing passenger on a high-speed train passing through a station and trying to read its name, I caught a glimpse of <em>fettuccine alla pap </em>… And decided it was <em>fettuccine alla pappardelle</em> before racing on. The glimpse stuck because it was weird. <em>Alla</em> means “in the style of”, so pasta in the style of pasta! That is, fettuccine (narrow ribbons typical of Lazio) in the style of pappardelle (thick ribbons typical of Tuscany, Umbria etc), which could mean wild boar, or porcini, or duck. All delicious, and such a musical name: fettuccine alla pappardelle! I would make it, one day.</p><p>The Italian food historian Massimo Montanari begins his book <a href="https://blackwells.co.uk/bookshop/product/9781787703285?gC=5a105e8b&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw8e-gBhD0ARIsAJiDsaUPndQ9m6kuo1om1pTHszwRtR2LoS-aNGTI6YUFvLMiakq-JNw3f14aAtjrEALw_wcB">A Short History of Spaghetti with Tomato Sauce</a> by talking about the origins of recipes, the age-old search for “the exact moment when someone had the idea to make something for the very first time” – the invention and the inventor, if you like. This has given rise to all sorts of stories that might have flecks of truth in them, but are more often the work of fantasy, fables, wordplay and mistakes. Montanari is clear to note that he isn’t negating the relevance of origins, or the reassuring value of “a beginning that explains”; rather, he simply reminds us that fiction has replaced history. The origin of fettuccine alla pappardelle, for example: a short-sighted woman in a rush misreads a recipe name and makes up a recipe she thinks about often enough to believe it is true –until she comes across the right page in the right book and discovers that it isn’t <em>fettuccine alla pappardelle</em> at all, but <em>fettuccine alla papalina</em>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/apr/10/pasta-peas-ham-egg-cheese-recipe-rachel-roddy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Tropical cyclone brews off the Kimberley while freezing rain causes chaos in Quebec and Ontario</p><p>At the weekend a tropical low that was situated in the Timor Sea moved west-south-west into waters north of the Kimberley, Western Australia. Deepening as it moved, the low developed into a tropical cyclone on Sunday night that brought gale-force winds of up to 56 mph (90km/h) to the coast. Squally thunderstorms across northern parts of the region produced strong winds and heavy rain.</p><p>The tropical cyclone is forecast to reach category 3 by Tuesday. From Wednesday it is expected to turn south, prompting the Australian Bureau of Meteorology to warn that a significant risk of further instability could steer the storm south-east into central or eastern Pilbara, or western Kimberley. Given sea surface temperatures will be 30-32C (86-90F), the cyclone is expected to deepen to a category 4, with some models forecasting central pressure as low as 910hPa.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/10/weather-tracker-storms-australia-canada-tropical-cyclone-kimberley-quebec-ontario">Continue reading...</a>

My gaze<br />slides along pewter-coloured horizontals<br />that evening sunlight turns to bronze.<br />It is a habitat where rare plants learn<br />to live with salt, and birds nest on the ground.<br />It is the place I am. It should be empty<br />of any presence otherwise.<br />Rage and tales of unmapped quicksand<br />are not discouraging enough.<br />The landscape fades. I fade. I mourn its beauty<br />leached into sketch and photograph<br />or into notebooks that birdwatchers carry.<br />The sea is close. I fear death by erosion.<br />It has grown dark but now the sky is starry.<br />I’ll jot down where I’d like my body found<br />but not by whom.

<p>The din of Britain’s conurbations affects poorer people disproportionately, blighting lives in cheaply built homes</p><p>Two years ago, my most lovingly overbearing and melodramatic auntie came to stay at my flat on an east London high road. Each morning she would emerge, fully dressed except for the eye mask left on her forehead like Chekhov’s gun, taking a few moments to chitchat before erupting: “Aren’t you going to ask how I slept? Just terrible! Sirens! Buses all night, driving sinners around. This noise will kill me. You’ll be sorry when I’m dead!”</p><p>Her exclamations may sound over the top. But it turns out that not even the most hyperbolic of relatives could overstate the dangers of this threat, which has lurked unrecognised for too long.

<p><strong>Electronic Arts; PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S<br /></strong>The controls can be tough to get the hang of, but the visuals are stunning, the commentary impressive and the play itself gives you all the challenge and realism you could want </p><p>After an eight-year hiatus from the world of golf simulation, Electronic Arts is back on the fairway, bringing its considerable licensing power and slick sports TV presentation skills with it. Featuring 30 courses, a large roster of current professionals, and a physics model built around the <a href="https://www.pgatour.com/article/news/latest/2022/02/02/pga-tour-selects-trackman-tracking-tracing-solution-beginning-in-2022">official TrackMan data</a> for authentic ball flight measurement and swing analysis, this game is exactly what you’d expect from EA Sports – comprehensive, packed with options and deadly serious about the sport.</p><p>Those hoping for an accessible knockabout are going to be quickly disappointed. The new swing mechanic, which requires you to pull down on the analogue stick to bring the club back, then forward again to unleash your shot, takes considerable time and effort to master. There’s a slight lag between your input and the onscreen swing visual, which makes timing tricky, especially when you’re not going for a full-power shot. Consequently, you spend a lot of matches over-hitting wildly, and this isn’t helped by the fact that the transition on the stick from pull-back to forward has to be precise or your golfer just pulls a practice swing. The difficulty is compounded by the fact that there’s no real tutorial mode. Instead you get a Coaching Academy section in the Challenge mode, which has lots of little mini-games based around various elements of the sport – but these don’t provide tips or feedback, so it’s all trial and a <em>lot</em> of error.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/apr/10/ea-sports-pga-tour-2023-review-serious-players-have-much-to-master-in-eas-return-to-the-virtual-fairway">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The author’s search for her childhood friend who shared her dreams of fleeing Clinton, Arkansas, is an elegiac story of lost opportunities</p><p>When journalist <a href="https://www.monicapotts.com/">Monica Potts</a> came across multiple studies concluding that, over the past decade, the life expectancy of the least-educated white Americans showed the longest and most sustained decline in 100 years, she determined to investigate. The downward trend was most marked among women, and she could easily have become one of those statistics.</p><p>Potts grew up in Clinton, Arkansas, a rural, majority-white town in the Ozark mountains, where poverty and lack of educational opportunities combined with the pervasive culture of evangelical Christianity to steer girls into early marriage and motherhood. Addiction and domestic abuse were widespread, though rarely acknowledged or addressed. A 2015 study by Princeton economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton attributed the drop in life expectancy among poor middle-aged white people to increases in drug overdoses, suicides and complications from alcoholism: “a trio of ailments they called ‘deaths of despair’”. “Words like <em>malaise</em> and <em>despair</em> hint at stories that can’t be told with data and statistics,” Potts writes. So she returned to Clinton, “with its ageing, shrinking population, governed by a small group of people who worshipped at the same churches as their parents and who had knit around themselves an ever thicker and tighter web of personal and political self-deceits”, in search of the women behind the statistics.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/10/the-forgotten-girls-by-monica-potts-review-a-quietly-raging-lament-for-wasted-lives-in-21st-century-america">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Brighton get deserved apology, Trent Alexander-Arnold looks a natural fit in midfield and Unai Emery continues to excel</p><p>There was no stadium VAR delay on Saturday to check whether Kaoru Mitoma had been fouled by Pierre-Emile Højbjerg. Why did neither Stuart Attwell nor Stockley Park see it as a penalty? To be generous, perhaps Mitoma hit the ground a little easily but the incident became a lighting rod for Brighton fans to argue that officialdom (rather than failing to close down Harry Kane for Tottenham’s winner) was the reason for defeat. Sixth place might have become fifth. When Howard Webb, on Sunday, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/09/pgmol-admits-brighton-should-have-been-awarded-penalty-in-defeat-to-spurs">apologised to Brighton</a> on behalf of PGMOL, there was vindication but no extra points on offer. “I think it was clear, very clear,” said Roberto De Zerbi, who had enjoyed the benefit of a dressing-room TV replay of the Mitoma incident, already red-carded for the touchline rumble that followed VAR ruling out Danny Welbeck’s goal. Soon enough, Kane seized on Brighton’s lack of concentration. “The smart people can adapt different habits,” admitted De Zerbi, asked about being red-carded for a second time. His excellent team are surely better off with a manager on the sidelines than not, as will be the case for next week’s FA Cup semi-final with Manchester United. <strong>John Brewin</strong></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/08/tottenham-brighton-premier-league-match-report">Tottenham 2-1 Brighton</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/09/liverpool-arsenal-premier-league-match-report">Liverpool 2-2 Arsenal</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/08/wolves-chelsea-premier-league-match-report">Wolves 1-0 Chelsea</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/08/aston-villa-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report">Aston Villa 2-0 Nottingham Forest</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/08/manchester-united-everton-premier-league-match-report">Manchester United 2-0 Everton</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/08/brentford-newcastle-premier-league-match-report">Brentford 1-2 Newcastle</a></em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/10/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action">Continue reading...</a>

## Will capital gains tax apply if a sale of a buy-to-let property is used to purchase another?

<p>The proceeds for the first house would be fully used as a deposit for the larger second one</p><p><strong>Q</strong> I own a buy-to-let property and am considering selling it to fund the purchase of a larger buy-to-let investment property. In essence, I would be moving the investment from property one to property two. The sale proceeds of property one (after deduction of the outstanding mortgages) would be fully used as a deposit for property. Would capital gains tax still apply, even though the investment has moved to another property?<br /><strong>DP</strong></p><p><strong>A</strong> Yes, capital gains tax (CGT) would still apply but, no, you wouldn’t be able to defer paying the tax by claiming business asset rollover relief – which is what I assume you are hoping to do. If you are eligible to claim it – which you are not – rollover relief lets you put off paying any CGT due on the gain from the sale of a business asset until you sell the business asset to replace it but only – among other things – if you are trading. Unfortunately for you, HM Revenue and Customs doesn’t consider investing in a buy-to-let property as trading. So you will have to pay CGT at 18% or 28% (depending on the rate of income tax you pay) on the gain you make on property one less the new £6,000 CGT allowance (which is down from £12,300 in the 2022-23 tax year and due to go down further to £3,000 in 2024-25).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/apr/10/will-capital-gains-tax-apply-if-a-sale-of-a-buy-to-let-property-is-used-to-purchase-another">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From the treatment of BAME patients historically to the disproportionate number of Covid deaths, this important study by an NHS doctor exposes discrimination in healthcare</p><p>Annabel Sowemimo is an NHS doctor, a registrar in sexual and reproductive health, and an academic and broadcaster on the intersection of race and medicine. Her new book, <em>Divided,</em> began as a column on decolonising healthcare for <em>gal-dem</em> – an influential platform for writers of colour – which, sadly, recently closed. Those articles have led to this important and ambitious title, which seeks to educate readers about the racist origins of western medicine, asking for recognition of the mistreatment of patients in the past, and calling for a correction to systemic and institutionalised discriminatory practice.</p><p>She is refreshingly honest about the lack of easy answers and acknowledges her frustration. “Well, what do you suggest we do instead then?” as a master’s student asks in the epilogue. But <em>Divided</em> is a necessary book, and pertinent, if also of its time in that it reads as if much of it was written during the pandemic, fuelled by those terrifyingly pointed losses of BAME clinicians in spring 2020 (the first 20 NHS workers who died from the virus were non-white). It soon became obvious that BAME staff were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/16/bame-people-more-likely-to-die-from-covid-than-white-people-study">disproportionately exposed and dying from the virus</a>, at risk from the patients for whom they provided care. <a href="https://www.fsrh.org/authors/dr-annabel-sowemimo/">Sowemimo</a> felt she “had to write the book” as no one could deny “that health inequalities and uneven power relations exist”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/10/divided-by-annabel-sowemimo-review-the-roots-of-racism-in-medicine">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Shot like still tableaux, this poignant documentary follows a mother and son as they try to extricate the latter from the clutches of heroin </p><p>The loneliness of addiction – and the toll it can take on an individual’s psyche and their relationships – is intimately explored in Paloma Sermon-Daï’s unassuming yet poignant documentary. In his small Belgian village, 43-year-old Damien Samedi has been known as Petit Samedi since childhood, an endearing nickname that bittersweetly reflects his state of arrested development. Having struggled with drug dependency for most of his adult life, Damien attempts to turn over a new leaf with therapy and the support of his mother, Ysma.</p><p>Documentaries often rely on handheld cameras to relay immediacy or intimacy; Petit Samedi, fortunately, is a welcome relief. Shot like still tableaux, evoking the style of posed family photos, every day conversations between mother and son gently unfold over the dinner table or in front of the TV. Keeping a respectful distance from its subjects, the film doesn’t sensationalise Damien’s plight, even when glimpses of his heroin habit quietly show up on screen. Here, addiction is not treated as a spectacle, but rather an alienating routine from which Damien works hard to escape.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/10/petit-samedi-review-intimate-exploration-of-the-loneliness-of-drug-addiction">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When she retired, Rosemary Griggs discovered a passion for researching 16th-century clothes. It led her to another adventure: telling the stories of history’s forgotten women</p><p>Rosemary Griggs has had two retirements, she says. Her first adventure, after retiring from the civil service at 55, was when she and husband, David, “did the sort of thing you would never advise your kids to do”: they bought a wooden house on stilts on 20 acres of rainforest in Belize (where David had worked for the Foreign Office). They also travelled extensively around Central America. But when David experienced a period of poor health, Griggs says: “That globetrotting bit of life came to an end.” Her “second retirement” has involved a very different kind of adventuring, through history, and in the guise of a Tudor noblewoman.</p><p>Back home in Devon, Griggs says, “it soon became clear that pottering in my garden and tending my allotment would not be enough for me”. When she was 63, she started volunteering at a nearby National Trust property, Compton Castle, and as part of her work there was invited to get involved with making a Tudor costume. Despite not having done any dressmaking since school, she agreed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/10/a-new-start-after-60-i-left-the-civil-service-and-started-dressing-in-tudor-costume">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Zodiacal constellation of the lion was recognised by Mesopotamians as early as 4000BC</p><p>Northern spring is the perfect time to see the constellation of Leo, the lion. Being a zodiacal constellation, it sits in the plane of the ecliptic, which marks the path followed by the sun throughout the year. It is bordered to the west by Cancer, the crab, and to the east by Virgo, the virgin.</p><p>Leo is a highly recognisable constellation because of its size and the number of bright stars it contains. The lion’s head is marked by the star Algenubi, and together with the stars that represent the mane and chest, forms an asterism known as “the sickle” because of its shape. The lion’s body is marked by four stars, Regulus, Algieba, Zosma, Denebola; the last star is named after the Arabic phrase meaning lion’s tail.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/apr/10/starwatch-spring-is-the-perfect-time-to-spot-leo-and-its-bright-stars">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Since Covid, the actor has been fighting for a legal change, determined no one should have to die alone. She discusses Partygate, rule-breaking – and getting drunk with King Charles</p><p>One day in June 2020 Ruthie Henshall – actor, singer, dancer, star of musical theatre – went to visit her mother, Gloria, at her residential care home in Suffolk. This was the first time Ruthie had seen her mum for three months – not because she didn’t want to go, or through neglect, but because of lockdown. They had done a few Zoom calls, but there was only one iPad to go around the 50 or so residents in the home, it needed to be booked and there had to be a carer free to help, so it only happened every couple of weeks. And anyway, Gloria, who had Alzheimer’s, didn’t get on very well with Zoom. “She thought she was watching us on television,” says Henshall.</p><p>“Visit” is perhaps an exaggeration. Henshall and her two sisters weren’t allowed in; they could only go to the window and wave at their mother inside. “She would wave back – she still recognised us. She couldn’t understand why we couldn’t come in, so she cried.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/apr/10/ruthie-henshall-while-mps-were-drinking-and-snogging-i-was-waving-at-mum-through-a-care-home-window">Continue reading...</a>
