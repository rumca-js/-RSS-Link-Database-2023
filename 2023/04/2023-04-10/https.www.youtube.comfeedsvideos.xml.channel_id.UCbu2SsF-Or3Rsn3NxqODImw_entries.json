This version of LA \u2013 cleverly nicknamed HELL-A by the game\u2019s developers \u2013 is brimming with undead creatures of all shapes and sizes. At the start of the game, you\u2019re making an attempt to escape the city by plane. Unfortunately things don\u2019t go as planned and you end up right back in the condemned street of LA, fighting your way through hordes of zombies, looking for fellow survivors.\n\nDead Island 2 is a first-person, semi-open-world action-RPG. Throughout the game you\u2019ll be able to explore iconic Los Angeles locations such as Venice Beach and Beverly Hills, but all these areas are stitched together by loading screens instead of being one big seamless world.  \n\nIn our preview of the game, Mark Delaney said, \u201cSometimes the way these areas would snake around surrounded by unclimbable walls felt very restrictive, closer to a game as tightly set as BioShock rather than even the original Dead Island's large hubs. While this is a much more linear game than its predecessors, there are many optional nooks in each area. I encountered many locked rooms, safes, and loot caches that would each require further investigating or even backtracking, some of which wasn't possible in my limited demo.\u201d", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-tKd1tO0z0", "date_published": "2023-04-10 15:30:21+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
