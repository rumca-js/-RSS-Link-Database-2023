On Friday, Perry was convicted of murder for shooting Garrett Foster during a 2020 Black Lives Matter protest. In his statement on the ruling, Texas Governor Greg Abbott said,<em> \"I am working as swiftly as Texas law allows regarding the pardon of Sgt. Perry,\" </em>and explained, <em>\"Unlike the President or some other states, the Texas Constitution limits the Governor's pardon authority to only act on a recommendation by the Board of Pardons and Paroles,\" [...] \"I have made that request [for a pardon] and and instructed the Board to expedite its review.\" </em></p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cI am working as swiftly as Texas law allows regarding the pardon of Sgt.

If you recall, roaming armed Antifa militias were somewhat common during the summer of 2020. </p><p>According to the Austin Police department's description, the Antifa group surrounded Perry's car, which included Foster, who was armed with a rifle. Perry's defense team said he had to defend himself against the mob. Perry told the 911 operator that night,<em> \"I made a wrong turn, a guy pointed a freakin weapon at me and I panicked. I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m just an Uber driver. I made a wrong turn; I\u2019ve never had to shoot someone before. They started shooting back at me, and I got out of the area.\" </em></p><p>Perry fired five shots out of the Uber, which hit Foster, who had not fired first. Another Antifa member fired three shots at Perry's car, but didn't hit anyone. </p><p>Now, I'm no lawyer, but it does seem like being surrounded by a gang of armed Antifa members would <em>probably</em> make someone fear for their life. Just a tad. And also probably warrant a \"Stand Your Ground\" situation. The prosecution, however, claimed Perry could have just driven away before he fired the shots. But as Perry himself said, he panicked because someone pointed a gun at him. </p><p>So only time will tell whether Perry will get off. But if he doesn't, he's facing up to life in prison. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Lily is a Zoomer college dropout who somehow landed a writing gig here at LwC.com.

But it has nothing to do with being a woman. </p><p>And it's also interesting that Mulvaney said this \"girlhood\" grows stronger when there are more people behind it, but only \"certain people are allowed in.\" This kiiiinda sounds like they'd like to \"recruit\" more people to \"girlhood.\" Does that mean trying to convince more people to become transgender? Because I thought it wasn't a choice. Or perhaps they just mean \"allies\"? Who can know, really. </p><p>Overall, I'm surprised this duo hasn't paired up before now since they're both dominating the TikTok trans trends. And what would we do without their important input on what it means to be a woman?</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Lily is a Zoomer college dropout who somehow landed a writing gig here at LwC.com.
