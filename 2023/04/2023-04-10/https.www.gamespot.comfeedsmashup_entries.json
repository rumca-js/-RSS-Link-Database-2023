Though the game was gorgeous and the gameplay as fun as ever, not much about Overwatch 2 seemed to differentiate it from its predecessor. To make matters worse, the one thing that <em>did </em>clearly separate it was Overwatch 2's shift away from the original's tone. Overwatch 2, with its sleek menus and battle pass system, didn't feel like the Overwatch I fell in love with, but rather a stylish first-person shooter eager to assimilate rather than celebrate the original's charm and sincerity. But with Season 4, all that <em>could </em>be changing.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">After months of half-heartedly picking up and dropping the game I once cherished so dearly, I find myself growing more invested in Overwatch 2. After months of pestering the game's development team with questions like, \"Can you explain how this new map/character will fit into the game's story or PvE?\" I finally feel a bit satisfied not knowing what's next--though to be clear, I do maintain my belief that launching the game without its highly anticipated PvE component was a misstep. The reason for this is not because I'm suddenly on board with the sequel's new direction, but because I feel like after taking the game a bit <em>too </em>seriously, the team is ready to return to what it does best: Creating a hopeful world filled with characters you can't help but adore, and putting the community first.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The beacon of this effort might very well be the game's newest hero, Lifeweaver. Though I'd argue Ramattra could easily end up being the most narratively important addition to the Overwatch roster and that every new character is well-designed and fun to play, there is something uniquely comforting about Lifeweaver--something that makes him feel a bit like the heroes we first met back in 2016.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-season-4-could-be-the-start-of-the-games-redemption-arc/1100-6513124/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-season-4-could-be-the-start-of-the-games-redemption-arc/1100-6513124/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-04-10 17:25:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Stranger Things Franchise Expands with New Animated Series", "description": "<p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Stranger Things universe is expanding yet again with the announcement of an animated series set in the show\u2019s world.

I mean, it's something that they're probably the most protective of, except for maybe Baby Yoda. So we had to kind of earn that. We had to go through a whole process of, why do you want it to be a Jedi? What do you want to do with the Jedi? They were really uncomfortable with Jedi, and they said, 'Let's reset this. Let's call this character a Force user,'\" Asmussen said.</p><p>Lucasfilm, Asmussen said, wanted to change Respawn's game to focus on a bounty hunter or a smuggler.

Eagle-eyed fans will spot the resemblance here to another Gen'dai enforcer, Durge, who showed up two decades ago in Star Wars: Clone Wars, the series of short episodes spearheaded by Genndy Tartakovsky of Dexter's Lab fame. While the latest trailer shows Rayvis executing some brutal physical attacks in the direction of Kestis, don't be too surprised if that fight takes a turn towards Resident Evil territory, as Gen'dai typically have a body composed of a mass of slimy tentacles that can quickly regenerate when they suffer any damage.</p><p>Their armor keeps their biomass in check, and this warrior race usually adheres to a code of honor when it comes to taking on worthy opponents.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-star-wars-jedi-survivor-gameplay-trailer-teases-an-epic-showdown-with-droids-and-bounty-hunters/1100-6513097/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-star-wars-jedi-survivor-gameplay-trailer-teases-an-epic-showdown-with-droids-and-bounty-hunters/1100-6513097/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-04-10 12:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Super Mario Bros.
