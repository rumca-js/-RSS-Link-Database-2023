## Is Solus Dead? (If you have to ask, the answer's probably YES!)

In the last couple of weeks, I've received some questions about Solus.  Their website was offline for a couple weeks.  Packages are horribly out of date.  And their doesn't appear to be anyone really in charge.  Now, DistroWatch is labelling Solus as a "dormant" distro.
