Can Alejandro Zohn, whose buildings include a market roofed by giant shells, make it famous for architecture?</p><p>A miniature billboard pokes up above the neatly trimmed hedge in the garden of the Schindler House in Los Angeles, as if a roadside ad had blown in from nearby Sunset Strip. Cantilevered from a chunky steel column, strapped to a base of pink concrete blocks, it is a startling arrival on the grounds of this hallowed modernist sanctuary. It\u2019s particularly strange as the hoarding in question is not advertising injury law or a Hollywood movie about a coked-up bear, but a 1970s public housing project in the Mexican city of Guadalajara.<br /><br />\u201cThe billboards are trying to make trouble,\u201d says Mimi Zeiger, co-curator of an exhibition here about the work of Mexican-Austrian architect <a href=\"https://www.makcenter.org/exhibitions/seeking-zohn\">Alejandro Zohn</a>. She gestures to a range of hoarding structures scattered around the garden of the famous house, like fragments of a more brash urban realm impinging on the quiet oasis, each displaying an image of Zohn\u2019s work. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to bring the scale of the city into the more secluded, domestic space, creating a bridge between Guadalajara and LA.\u201d<br /><br />The bold signs are a provocative addition to the West Hollywood sanctum built by Austrian \u00e9migr\u00e9 architect Rudolph Schindler in 1922 and often regarded as the <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/celebrating-the-centennial-of-arguably-the-worlds-first-modern-house-in-west-hollywood\">Ur-monument of southern California modernism</a>. The house was designed after Schindler and his wife spent the summer in a cabin in Yosemite national park, and it embodies his desire to channel the sense of camping out in nature in the form of a bohemian shack.</p><p>For all the sanctity heaped on it since, the house is a refreshingly rough and ready thing, built on a shoestring. A poured concrete slab serves as both the foundation and finished floor surface, <a href=\"http://kingsroadhouse.blogspot.com/2012/12/the-construction_9.html\">on which the walls were cast flat then hauled up into place</a>, topped with a simple redwood roof, with big canvas panels that slide open to the garden. It is a poetically primitive place, exuding the excitement of outdoor living from someone freshly arrived from colder climes \u2013 complete with \u201csleeping baskets\u201d on the roof (on the assumption that LA was warm enough to spend nights outside. They soon found it wasn\u2019t.)<br /><br />Since the 1990s, the house has been home to the <a href=\"https://www.makcenter.org/schindler-house\">MAK Center for Art and Architecture</a>, an outpost of the Museum of Applied Arts in Vienna, hosting a programme that explores the intersection of the two disciplines, while always being careful not to screw anything into the precious walls (the property is owned and maintained by local non-profit, Friends of the Schindler House). It is a fine balancing act of keeping the house sparse enough for the pilgrims who come to worship the purity of the architecture, while injecting enough variety to keep local audiences coming back.<br /><br />The choice of Zohn is an inspired one. Like Schindler, he was a Jewish \u00e9migr\u00e9 to the Americas \u2013 his parents fled Vienna in 1939 when he was eight \u2013 and a prolific architect, with around 500 projects to his name, yet he remains virtually unknown outside Mexico. Unlike Luis Barrag\u00e1n or F\u00e9lix Candela, icons of mid-century modernism whose photogenic work travelled widely, Zohn was a generation later (he died in 2000), and was based in the western city of Guadalajara \u2013 often regarded by Mexico City\u2019s taste-making elite as a provincial place of tequila and mariachi music.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/10/alejandro-zohn-guadalajara-mexican\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/10/alejandro-zohn-guadalajara-mexican", "date_published": "2023-04-10 17:32:43+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Leak of secret US defense papers could be \u2018tip of the iceberg\u2019, report says", "description": "<p>Disclosure already represents worst national security breach in years, and analysts suggest damage to US could get worse</p><p>The recent leak of more than a hundred secret US defense documents could just be the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d of a trove of material that had started circulating long before it was widely noticed, according to a new report.</p><p>The disclosure of highly classified material already represents Washington\u2019s worst national security breach in many years, including details about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/10/ukraines-air-defences-could-soon-run-out-of-missiles-apparent-pentagon-leak-suggests\">Ukraine\u2019s lack of ammunition</a>, US <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/09/politics/pentagon-leaked-documents-us-spying-allies-foes/index.html\">intelligence collection methods</a> used against Russia, and embarrassing evidence pointing to US spying on close allies such as Ukraine, South Korea and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/08/world/middleeast/israel-mossad-leaked-documents-pentagon.html\">Israel</a>.

The new swing mechanic, which requires you to pull down on the analogue stick to bring the club back, then forward again to unleash your shot, takes considerable time and effort to master.
