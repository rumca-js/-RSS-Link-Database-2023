This video was originally posted on March 10th, 2021. 

After 36 years, there have been a lot of Mario games, with hundreds of levels between them and most of them are pretty great. So we decided it was time to comb through the treasure trove of stages and poll our entire staff to find out which levels have stood the test of time better than all the rest. 

Please note, while certain members of the staff championed to include wonderful levels from games like Paper Mario, and even Super Mario World 2 (which is undoubtedly part of the Yoshi series), we opted to stick with games from the main series So expect to see levels from Super Mario 64, Super Mario Odyssey, Super Mario Sunshine, and even Super Mario Bros. for NES!

Star Wars Celebration brings the biggest Star Wars news of what’s to come to Disney Plus and there was a certain Star Wars celebration panel that fulfilled the promise. Three brand-new Star Wars films were announced, set in three different periods of the Star Wars canon timeline, but as prior Star Wars film projects have stalled out during the development process, is there any guarantee that these films will eventually make it to the big screen? Join IGN Host Kim Horcher as she breaks down the film's chances.

Star Wars Celebration brings the biggest Star Wars news of what’s to come to Disney Plus and there was a certain Star Wars celebration panel that fulfilled the promise. At Star Wars Celebration 2023, a New Jedi Order movie with Daisy Ridley was announced, James Mangold will be taking on The Old Republic (unclear if Revan will be part of it), and while a New Jedi ORder movie is cool, Dave Filoni and what looks like a Mandalorian movie, or rather New Republic movie, has us hyped! Shameen Obaid Chinoy will direct the new Jedi Order, and we talked to Kathleen Kennedy about that new Jedi Oder movie along with all the Star Wars lore we could to get some answers about Rey. “New Jedi Order” will be brand new territory, but will a new Jedi order be like, as Rey may essentially form a new version, Luke Skywalker’s New Jedi Order, of sorts. Rey and Daisy Ridley returning is huge, and she’ll be facing problems perhaps greater than even the yuuzhan vong! But while we’re excited by the movie prospects for Ahsoka, the Jedi order, Grogu, new takes on Order 66, the possibility of John Boyega (fn-2187 aka Finn), Jedi lore, and more, we have to wonder given the history…will these movies happen?
