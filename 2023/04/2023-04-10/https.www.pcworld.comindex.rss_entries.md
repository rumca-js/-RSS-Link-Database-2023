<p>YouTube Premium feels like one of the more expensive services out there, since it&rsquo;s asking more than something like Disney+ or HBO Max, but just to make a free service work better, by eliminating ads and more. The newest additions to Premium probably won&rsquo;t change your mind on that, whether you&rsquo;re willing to pay for it or not. But they might just tip the scales if you&rsquo;re a videophile, or you want to watch videos along with your remote friends. </p>



<p>According to the latest <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/5-premium-features-to-up-your-youtube-game/&amp;xcust=2-2-1781123-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">YouTube blog post</a>, the new additions to Premium include a &ldquo;1080p premium&rdquo; tier of video quality, which boosts the bitrate for playback similar to VuDu&rsquo;s enhanced video options. At the moment it&rsquo;s only available on iOS devices, but it&rsquo;ll be rolling out to Premium web users as an experiment in the near future. There&rsquo;s also better integration across web and mobile devices: Premium users will see a &ldquo;continue watching&rdquo; mini-video if they&rsquo;ve paused on their other gadget, without having to dive into the Library or History tab. </p>



<p>YouTube is now supporting iOS SharePlay, which allows different users to watch a video in sync while talking on FaceTime. (Only one person on the call needs to be subscribed to Premium.) Android users could already do this through the Live Sharing feature on Google Meet, likewise locked behind the Premium tier. Android and iOS YouTube apps will also get the ability to add videos to the upcoming queue without needing to create a new playlist. </p>



<p>YouTube Premium remains <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/premium&amp;xcust=2-2-1781123-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an $11.99 a month subscription</a>, which is odd, since the YouTube TV service <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/youtube-tv-price-hike#:~:text=YouTube%20TV%20will%20cost%20subscribers%20%2472.99%20per%20month%20beginning%20in%20April%202023.&amp;text=Anna%20Helhoski%20is%20a%20senior,an%20authority%20on%20student%20loans.&amp;xcust=2-2-1781123-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">keeps jumping up in price</a>. Existing benefits (which aren&rsquo;t going anywhere) include ad-free playback, background playback on mobile devices, mobile offline downloads, and ad-free access to the YouTube Music app. </p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to saddle the 70mai Dash Cam Omni with the adjective <em>cute</em>, though the onboard and app graphics animations push that aesthetic somewhat. (If you&rsquo;re familiar with the movie Wall-E, you&rsquo;re familiar with the vibe.) <em>Clever</em> and <em>unique</em> are far better terms to describe the unit with its motorized, rotatable camera.</p>



<p>More than that, the Omni is an effective dash cam that takes detailed video from any direction you point it at&mdash;day or night.</p>



<p>Note that all images are showing the Omni resting its mount. Normally, the mount&rsquo;s flat end would be stuck to your windshield with the camera body hanging down.</p>



<h2 id="70mai-dash-cam-omni-design-and-features">70mai Dash Cam Omni design and features</h2>



<p>The Omni looks very much like a very large pill or capsule. The bottom third of the ellipsoid is occupied by the 1080p, 60fps camera, which rotates 360 degrees. It&rsquo;s not a 360 degree view; you use the app to point the 140 degree field-of-view camera in <em>any</em> direction. </p>



<p>You&rsquo;d use the app because the camera is motorized. In fact, when you first boot, it will orient itself to the forward position. There are warnings not to rotate the camera by hand, lest you break it, but I didn&rsquo;t see them until after I had already attempted using my paws. I was gentle and the camera still functioned, but I&rsquo;d stick with the app for this.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s odd that you must rotate the camera clockwise (with the camera end pointed down) to cover areas to the rear&mdash;there&rsquo;s a stop at around the 270 degree mark when you rotate counter-clockwise. </p>



<p>The Dash Cam Omni features a 1.2-inch display, which is good for seeing large text, but the display&rsquo;s curved plastic covering can create some mild glare and distortion&mdash;one of the downsides of a capsule design. It can be a tad problematic as the driver will be sitting off-center and must lean over to get a good view. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1679700" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/70Mai-Dash-Cam-Omni-controls.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Here, with the Dash Cam Omni sitting upright on its base, you can see the camera lens at the top of the screen. In your car the orientation would be reversed.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>There&rsquo;s another potentially negative aspect to the Omni, depending on your car and where you park it: The mount, while being a clever, hinged affair (think Pacman&rsquo;s mouth), is affixed to your windshield with a semi-permanent adhesive and can&rsquo;t be easily removed from the windshield, or removed from the camera itself. </p>



<p>Parking here in San Francisco on the street, with a convertible, no less, makes leaving a dash cam in the car tantamount to yelling &ldquo;Steal this!&rdquo; at the top of your lungs. If you park under more secure circumstances, it&rsquo;s a non-issue.</p>



<p>Connecting the phone app with the camera via Wi-Fi is required to use and configure the camera. That in itself is fine, but I absolutely don&rsquo;t like having to sign up with the company and register the camera before it will record.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>More than just a novelty, the Omni is an effective dash cam that takes detailed video from any direction you point it at&mdash;day or night.</p></blockquote></figure>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1679699" height="752" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/70Mai-Dash-Cam-Omni-port.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure></div>



<p>I do it for the sake of you readers (and because it&rsquo;s my job), but on my own, this is a non-starter. I asked the company about telemetry and they assured me that no data is being gathered. The response seemed sincere, and indeed it would not be an easy deal to grab video data, which is relatively massive. </p>



<p>Still, when I buy something, I don&rsquo;t want to be forced online before using it.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1681121" height="620" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/70mai-app-main.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The 70mai app provides a live view, access to previous captures, and the ability to change all the settings. It&rsquo;s also required to register the camera for first use.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The app, as mentioned provides access to all settings, previous videos, and a live view. You may also offload video by simply attaching the unit via it&rsquo;s Type-C connector to a computer. That&rsquo;s a good thing as the 128GB of memory is internal eMMC, not on removable SD cards. </p>



<p>Other features are parking mode with motion detection and time-lapse captures. </p>



<h2 id="70mai-dash-cam-omni-captures">70mai Dash Cam Omni captures</h2>



<p>The Omni&rsquo;s 1080p video is very colorful and detailed. In fact, it compares quite well in this regard with many 1440p or 2160p dash cams. Sometimes there was shimmer and moire when the Omni&rsquo;s video was played back. Though noticeable, the artifacts were not particularly distracting. Given the purpose of a dash cam, we&rsquo;ll opt for detail every time.</p>



<p>We also like that the GPS info is watermarked. And yes, I never changed Km/H to MPH</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1679505" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/70Mai-Dash-Cam-Omni-capture-4.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Given the cloudy day, this is an excellent capture and note the detail in the license plate.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Detail is retained in night captures, as is the color. Headlight flare is handled well, though a clean windshield would&rsquo;ve shown that off to better effect. Hey, I live in a city. Schmutz happens. Note that lacking infrared, Omni interior night captures will require you to turn on your cabin lighting for best results.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1679506" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/70Mai-Dash-Cam-Omni-capture-1.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Sorry, finding a parking space this time of night trumped taking a normal head-on video. This does illustrate the amount of flare you&rsquo;ll see. And yes, my windshield could be cleaner. Think of this as real-life testing.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>There&rsquo;s a 300mAh battery on board the Dash Cam Omni which allows it to capture events after a possible power failure. Admittedly, sudden power loss isn&rsquo;t common, but it&rsquo;s nice to know you&rsquo;re covered if it does occur.</p>



<p>The Dash Cam Omni takes very colorful, highly detailed video day and night. It&rsquo;s also proof of the high quality you can wring from 1080p captures. You don&rsquo;t have to throw four times the space-wasting pixels at the task.   </p>



<h2 id="is-the-70mai-dash-cam-omni-worth-it">Is the 70mai Dash Cam Omni worth it?</h2>



<p>Though the mount makes this camera a poor fit for my parked-on-city-streets convertible, I quite like the Dash Cam Omni. It&rsquo;s unique and interesting, but it&rsquo;s also more than a novelty, as it takes detailed captures day and night. The integrated GPS and easy setup just sweeten the deal.</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for something effective that&rsquo;s also off the beaten path, by all means, this cutie is a contender. My biggest complaint is the register-before-use issue, which I find intrusive.</p>

## InWinâ€™s origami PC case brings new meaning to DIY

<p>A PC case is typically just a nice box for you to put all your parts in, with a few standardized mounting brackets, sufficient air ingress and egress for cooling, and maybe a USB port or two. But this year manufacturers <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1502500/three-new-products-making-it-even-easier-to-build-a-pc.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">seem to be stepping up their innovation</a>, if only because PC-building customers are desperate for something new. The latest example is the POC from InWin, a Mini-ITX case that you literally assemble yourself by folding sheets of steel. </p>



<p>With its vibrant primary colors and interactive assembly guide, the POC seems more like an adult LEGO kit or Nintendo&rsquo;s LABO cardboard line than a conventional PC case. But rest assured, once you&rsquo;ve meticulously followed the instructions, complete with full 3D illustrations, you&rsquo;ll have an ITX-compatible PC case ready to accept all your parts. A surprisingly capable case, too &mdash; thanks to an isolated and extended graphics card chamber, it can handle GPUs up to 3.5 slots wide and 346mm long. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="InWin POC case instructions" class="wp-image-1781026" height="704" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/inwin-instructions.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">InWin</p></div>



<p>Once you&rsquo;ve carefully folded all the metal pieces <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084HJ276L/&amp;xcust=2-1-1780988-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a la a Metal Earth kit</a>, you can install the electronics hardware: a 120mm RGB fan, a front panel with a USB Type-C port and two USB 3.2 Gen1 ports, and a combination audio jack, and a PCIe 4.0 riser for the graphics card. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Internally the case can handle just one 2.5-inch hard drive or SDD, and power supplies of up to 160mm long. The design is travel-friendly with side handles (hello, GameCube!), but a little awkward to fit into a conventional desktop setup, with the front panel sitting squarely in the middle of the top of its rectangular frame. There appears to be only one mounting location for the included fan and no others, so those with high-power components and air cooling might want to pop out the triangular front-facing vents. </p>

It comes with a free aluminum mousepad at the time of writing. </p>

<p>Look at the left side of your row of email in Gmail. See the star there? You can click on it to track different messages&mdash;things you want to follow up on, remember for later, or otherwise find quickly.</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;ve used it before, you likely only know it as a yellow star that can be toggled on and off. But did you know that other colors exist too as well as other icon shapes that include different colored exclamation marks, a check mark, and a question mark?</p>



<p>To expand your lineup of star types, click on Gmail&rsquo;s gear icon, then choose <em>See all settings</em>. Under <em>General</em>, scroll down to <em>Stars</em>. By default, the &ldquo;1 star&rdquo; option will be selected, but you can instead choose the option for &ldquo;4 stars&rdquo; (yellow and blue stars, green checkmark, and red exclamation mark) or &ldquo;all stars&rdquo; (six colored stars, plus a variety of six additional icons). After you pick the 4 stars or all stars option, keep clicking when starring an email to cycle through the set.</p>

<p>This is one of my long-time favorite features in Gmail&mdash;I&rsquo;ve used it daily since I discovered it well over a decade ago, back when it was part of Google Labs experimental add-ons. (RIP). Fortunately, it graduated to becoming an official integration into Gmail and survived the reaper. I use it to more distinctly flag items for my mental to-do list, separating out what&rsquo;s high priority, requires follow-up, and potential reference material. You can search for email <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://gmail.googleblog.com/2011/08/tuesday-tip-stars.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1683414-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">tagged with a specific star type</a>, too, which is helpful when seeking specific groups of email.</p>



<p>There are other ways to get more out of Gmail, of course, so it&rsquo;s worth learning other tricks, like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394750/change-your-display-name-in-gmail-outlook-aol-yahoo-mail-and-more.html">how to change your display name</a>, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1367164/how-to-block-and-unblock-someone-in-gmail.html">how to block (and unblock) someone</a>, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/414716/5-ways-to-search-gmail-that-everyone-should-know-about.html">how to better search</a> your email. But I find that this tiny feature can supercharge email sorting, especially when combined with Gmail&rsquo;s filters and labels.</p>

Give it a starting point by providing certain information about the desired dish, such as the type of cuisine, the main ingredients you want to use, or any dietary restrictions you may have. ChatGPT will then provide a recipe with step-by-step instructions, ingredient quantities, and cooking tips.</p>



<p>I asked ChatGPT to create a whiskey-based cocktail using a Swedish meatball as one of the ingredients. It quickly acknowledged that this was an unconventional request, but then proceeded to provide a recipe based on my requirements. It even named the cocktail &ldquo;The Smokey Meatball Swizzle,&rdquo; though I think &ldquo;Meatball Manhattan&rdquo; is a much better name.</p>

<h2 id="draft-a-personalized-workout-plan">Draft a personalized workout plan</h2>



<p>ChatGPT can create <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/614205/5-apps-that-make-exercising-fun-and-easy.html">personalized workout plans</a> tailored to your fitness level, goals, available equipment, health condition, and more. To get started, you&rsquo;ll need to provide some information about yourself, like your basic information, current fitness level, workout experience, goals, health condition, and access to equipment.</p>



<p>I asked ChatGPT to create a 3-month exercise plan for me. I input my age, gender, weight, and told it I have a bad knee. I also mentioned that I don&rsquo;t have access to gym equipment and that my goal was to lose 15 lbs. It let me know that it&rsquo;s important to consult with a healthcare professional or certified personal trainer before starting a new exercise routine and to monitor my form to make sure I don&rsquo;t injure myself. Regardless, it outlined a routine for me based on the information I gave it.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="ChatGPT prompt and result" class="wp-image-1681262" height="622" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Workout-plan.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Marshall Gunnell/IDG</p></div>



<p>If you don&rsquo;t know which information to put in, you can ask ChatGPT what it requires to develop the most accurate and personalized workout plan possible.</p>



<h2 id="engage-in-trivia-games">Engage in trivia games</h2>



<p>You can challenge ChatGPT to, or have it create, trivia games by providing questions, answers, or interesting facts on a wide range of subjects. Just tell ChatGPT you want to play, specify the topic or theme you&rsquo;d like to focus on, and then ChatGPT will generate questions for you to answer. Or, you can challenge ChatGPT with your own trivia questions.</p>



<p>I told ChatGPT that I wanted to play a trivia game with it and asked it to give me five questions related to quantum physics. I told it I would give it my answers and it should tell me if I&rsquo;m correct. I got three out of five questions correct (with the help of Google). As it turns out, quantum physics is hard.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="ChatGPT prompt and result" class="wp-image-1681257" height="619" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Trivia.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Marshall Gunnell/IDG</p></div>



<h2 id="free-virtual-travel-guide">Free virtual travel guide</h2>



<p>ChatGPT can act as a virtual travel guide by providing information, recommendations, and advice about various travel destinations. One thing to keep in mind is that ChatGPT&rsquo;s knowledge is, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1669890/chatgpts-new-web-browsing-power-means-its-no-longer-stuck-in-2021.html">at least for now</a>, based on data up to 2021. This means that it can&rsquo;t recommend anything that may have popped up recently, such as a new restaurant. It can still offer valuable insights about places to visit, local customs, cuisines, and other travel-related topics.</p>



<p>I told ChatGPT that I&rsquo;m planning a trip to Taipei, Taiwan, and asked it to recommend some must-visit attractions and some food that&rsquo;s popular among the locals. It sent a solid list of places to visit, and the list of food that it recommended was pretty accurate, though I was disappointed it didn&rsquo;t add <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.wandercooks.com/dan-bing-tuna-egg-crepe/&amp;xcust=2-1-1681251-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Dan Bing</a> to the list.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="ChatGPT prompt and result" class="wp-image-1681263" height="624" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Travel.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Marshall Gunnell/IDG</p></div>



<h2 id="compose-music">Compose music</h2>



<p>While ChatGPT can&rsquo;t directly <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/727351/best-laptops-for-music-production.html">compose music or create audio files</a>, it can help with various aspects of music composition like writing lyrics, suggesting chord progressions, or providing tips on song structure and arrangement. You can ask for guidance on specific musical concepts or brainstorm ideas for melodies or harmonies.</p>



<p>I asked ChatGPT to give me suggestions for a good chord progression for a jazz piece that I&rsquo;m writing in E-flat minor. It then suggested the i &ndash; iv &ndash; VII7 &ndash; III7 &ndash; V7 &ndash; i(9) chord progression, and encouraged me to experiment with chord extensions, substitutions, and alterations to add depth to the jazz piece.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="ChatGPT prompt and result" class="wp-image-1681259" height="626" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Music.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Marshall Gunnell/IDG</p></div>



<h2 id="get-help-with-meditation-and-mindfulness-exercises">Get help with meditation and mindfulness exercises</h2>



<p>For those who like to meditate, ChatGPT can help guide you through mindfulness exercises by providing instructions and support. For example, if you want to do a five-minute mindful breathing exercise, ChatGPT will give you detailed step-by-step instructions on what to do.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="ChatGPT prompt and result" class="wp-image-1681261" height="625" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Meditate.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Marshall Gunnell/IDG</p></div>



<p>If you want to do a different type of meditation or mindfulness exercise, but aren&rsquo;t sure what to do, you can always ask ChatGPT to give you some suggestions.</p>



<h2 id="craft-a-resume">Craft a resume</h2>



<p>There are many <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://resumegenius.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1681251-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">resume builders</a> out there, but ChatGPT can provide guidance, suggestions, and tips for content and formatting if you want to create your resume yourself. You&rsquo;ll need to provide information about your work experience, education, skills, achievements, and other relevant details that you&rsquo;d like it to include.</p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re not comfortable doing that, you can ask ChatGPT to give you a resume template for the job you are applying for. I told it that I was applying for a job as a staff writer at PCWorld but I didn&rsquo;t want to give it my personal information, and it made a decent resume template for me. All I&rsquo;d need to do later would be to fill in the blanks.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="ChatGPT prompt and result" class="wp-image-1681256" height="620" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Resume.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Marshall Gunnell/IDG</p></div>



<h2 id="get-a-personal-stylist">Get a personal stylist</h2>



<p>AI hasn&rsquo;t made it to the point where it can physically style someone, but it can offer fashion advice by suggesting outfit ideas, color combinations, accessorizing, and more. It can also give you tips on what to wear for specific occasions.</p>



<p>You&rsquo;ll need to share some personal details with it, like your style preferences, body type, what the occasion is, or other specific requirements you may have. I told ChatGPT that I was going to a Nintendo-themed party and needed suggestions for a business-casual style that incorporated Nintendo&rsquo;s corporate colors. Its suggestions were very detailed.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="ChatGPT prompt and result" class="wp-image-1681264" height="622" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Stylist.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Marshall Gunnell/IDG</p></div>



<h2 id="play-a-text-based-rpg">Play a text-based RPG</h2>



<p>ChatGPT can create text-based role-playing <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1502954/100-great-pc-games-you-should-play-before-you-die.html">games that you can play</a> by responding to the given prompts and making choices based on the scenario. You can leave it up to ChatGPT to create the setting of the game or you can give it a detailed explanation yourself.</p>



<p>I told ChatGPT that I wanted to play a text-based role-playing game set on a distant, hostile planet that I&rsquo;ve just crashed on. I&rsquo;m the only surviving member of the crew, and the planet has very little vegetation and water. The goal is to survive and make it back to my planet. ChatGPT didn&rsquo;t fail to deliver.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="ChatGPT prompt and result" class="wp-image-1681260" height="623" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/RPG.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Marshall Gunnell/IDG</p></div>



<h2 id="write-poetry">Write poetry</h2>



<p>ChatGPT can write poetry in various styles and themes. Give ChatGPT the basic information it needs to create the poem, like a topic, style, desired mood, or anything else you think is relevant. It will then generate a poem based on that information.</p>



<p>I asked ChatGPT to write a poem about Mario rescuing Zelda from Ganondorf, and Princess Peach getting jealous and running away with Luigi. I told it that it should be written in the style of Walt Whitman, who is generally considered the father of free verse. It generated a fantastic poem and then turned that into a haiku when asked.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="ChatGPT prompt and result" class="wp-image-1681255" height="623" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Poetry.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Marshall Gunnell/IDG</p></div>



<h2 id="whats-next">What&rsquo;s next?</h2>



<p>ChatGPT has opened up a world of possibilities for users seeking assistance, entertainment, or creative inspiration. Its versatility in handling a diverse range of tasks&mdash;from generating recipes and workout plans to crafting resumes and composing poetry&mdash;demonstrates the power of AI in enhancing our everyday lives.</p>



<p>As technology continues to evolve, we can expect even more innovative applications of ChatGPT and similar AI models. The future of AI-powered assistance is bright, and we are only beginning to scratch the surface of its potential to revolutionize the way we interact with the digital world.

Buy this is you&rsquo;re obsessed with Apple-style design and want the best laptop display you can get right now.</p>
</div>


<p>Performance-minded gamers looking for sleek, understated design with a beautiful screen will find a worthy specimen in the Razer Blade 15 OLED. This smartly appointed machine boasts a 12th-Gen Intel i9 CPU and Nvidia RTX 3070 Ti GPU, generating impressive views on demanding gaming titles while looking clean and simple enough to carry to the office any day of the week.</p>



<p>While lovers of bombastic design aesthetics with aggressively styled air vents and sweeping angles may find the simplicity of the Blade 15 a bit mild for their taste, this laptop sports a beautifully flush RGB keyboard and ample ports for those focused on functionality over a flashy case. At $3,299, this is no entry-level machine, and it&rsquo;s bound to appeal more to mature gamers who prefer to distinguish themselves through their in-game action than their laptop&rsquo;s looks.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>For more options, check out our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407493/best-gaming-laptops.html">best gaming laptops</a> available right now.</p></blockquote>



<h2 id="razer-blade-15-oled-specs-and-features">Razer Blade 15 OLED: Specs and features</h2>



<p>The machine we tested came configured with high-end, but not extreme, components:</p>



<ul><li><strong>CPU: </strong>Intel Core 9i-12900H</li><li><strong>GPU: </strong>Nvidia RTX 3070 Ti with 8GB VRAM</li><li><strong>Memory: </strong>16GB DDR5</li><li><strong>Storage: </strong>1TB PCIe SSD</li><li><strong>Webcam: </strong>1080p IR Hello camera with IR facial recognition</li><li><strong>Display: </strong>15.6-inch 2560 x 1440 QHD 240Hz OLED</li><li><strong>Connectivity:</strong> 1 x Thunderbolt 4 (USB-C), 2 x USB-C 3.2 (15W), 3 x USB-A 3.2 Gen 2, 3.5mm combo audio jack</li><li><strong>Networking: </strong>Killer Wireless Wi-Fi 6E AX1690 (IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax/az), Bluetooth 5.2</li><li><strong>Battery capacity:</strong> 80 Watt-hour</li><li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 0.67 inches x 9.25 inches x 13.98 inches</li><li><strong>Weight:</strong> 4.4 pounds</li><li><strong>Price</strong>: $3,299</li></ul>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Razer Blade 15 OLED back" class="wp-image-1682978" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/razer-blade-15-oled-back.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The Blade 15 OLED is sleek and sophisticated, except for all the fingerprints you&rsquo;ll be constantly trying to wipe away.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Foundry / Robert Strohmeyer</p></div>



<h2 id="razer-blade-15-oled-design-and-build-quality">Razer Blade 15 OLED: Design and build quality</h2>



<p>Built for image-conscious gamers and content creators, the Razer Blade 15 OLED is a solidly built machine that delivers a substantial feel under the hands while showing nicely on your desk. Its matte-black T6 anodized aluminum case is beautiful when clean, but the black picks up smudges easily, even from clean hands, so keeping it looking new requires regular wipe-downs. The Venn diagram of people who will spend three grand on this machine and people who will be infuriated by how easily its surface picks up fingerprints has a great deal of overlap.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Razer&rsquo;s design aesthetic yields square corners and straight lines, letting the machine&rsquo;s actual performance speak to its gaming cred, rather than pretending at performance through overwrought, swoopy design gimmicks. Apple comparisons abound with the Razer Blade, and for good reason. In design and price, this machine is obviously built to appeal to the MacBook Pro crowd, and won&rsquo;t win over anyone looking for top performance at a bargain price.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Blade 15 OLED is heavier than it looks, and every time I picked it up I was somehow surprised by its heft. This is largely an optical illusion at play, as this machine looks so similar in construction to an aluminum Apple laptop, I found myself unconsciously expecting it to weigh about as much as my 16-inch Macbook Pro, though in reality it&rsquo;s almost a full pound heavier. Compared with similarly equipped laptops in the 16-inch range, however, 4.4 pounds is a modest weight. If anything, gamers will find this machine and its accompanying power brick fairly svelte relative to other machines in the field.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Razer Blade 15 OLED front" class="wp-image-1682983" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/razer-blade-15-oled.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The Razer Blade 15 OLED&rsquo;s fast 240Hz QHD display is the rightful center of attention on this luxury-oriented machine.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Foundry / Robert Strohmeyer</p></div>



<h2 id="razer-blade-15-oled-display">Razer Blade 15 OLED: Display</h2>



<p>The centerpiece of the Blade 15 OLED&rsquo;s design is its 240Hz 15.6-inch QHD OLED display, which delivers absolutely beautiful graphics at 2560&times;1440 resolution, making it the single most gorgeous laptop display. That crazy fast refresh rate makes for smooth, rich visuals on high-end games, with simply the best-looking HDR contrasts I&rsquo;ve seen on any laptop, ever. Blacks are deep and dark. Transitions are smooth and clean.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s nice and bright at roughly 400 nits, rivaling high-end desktop monitors for overall quality. The glossy surface, however, produced annoying glare when I tested it near windows or under bright lights.</p>



<p>Powering that outlandishly superior display, on our test unit, is a comparatively decent Nvidia RTX 3070 Ti GPU. Its gaming graphics performance is very good, but not unbelievable, which feels a little disappointing. At nearly $2,900 MSRP, it&rsquo;s hard not to want to take the GPU up a notch to match the capabilities of the display.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Razer Blade 15 OLED left side" class="wp-image-1682980" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/razer-blade-15-oled-left.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The left side of the Blade 15 OLED sports its power port, two USB-A ports, a USB-C, and a headphone jack.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Foundry / Robert Strohmeyer</p></div>



<h2 id="razer-blade-15-oled-inputs-and-outputs">Razer Blade 15 OLED: Inputs and outputs</h2>



<p>In line with the robust feel of the aluminum chassis, the Blade 15&rsquo;s RGB-backlit keyboard and trackpad feel substantial and solid under the fingers. Keyboard flex is minimal, even in heavy typing, and the precision glass trackpad feels firm to the touch, with a decisive clicking action, and highly responsive to Windows touch gestures. &nbsp;</p>



<p>On the left side of the machine you have power input, a USB-C port, two USB-A 3.2 ports, and a headphone jack. On the right you have an SD card slot, USB-C, another USB-A, HDMI, and a security lock port. The underside sports two fans with adequate air flow to blow out the heat this bad boy builds up.</p>



<p>The choice of both HDMI and Thunderbolt 4 (via USB-C) means plenty of options for driving high-end external displays.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Signing in is simple and secure with the 1080p Windows Hello-enabled IR webcam, and the camera produces rich HD video for all your Zooms and streams.</p>

</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Foundry / Robert Strohmeyer</p></div>



<h2 id="razer-blade-15-oled-performance">Razer Blade 15 OLED: Performance</h2>



<p>While its super-fast OLED display is truly astounding to behold, the overall performance of the Blade 15 OLED is surprisingly middling relative to other machines in its class. It performed well in gaming and productivity tests, but fell short on video rendering tests.</p>



<p>In <em>Rise of the Tomb Raider,</em> the Blade 15 OLED came in second with a score of 146.5 frames-per-second, behind the MSI GE76 Raider&rsquo;s killer score of 180 fps. That performance difference is pretty acceptable, given how much richer the darks and contrasts look, and how smooth the transitions are, on the Blade&rsquo;s high-refresh display.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage center"><figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img alt="Razer Blade 15 Rise of the Tomb Raider test" class="wp-image-1682988" height="371" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Razer-Blade-15-OLED-Rise-of-the-Tomb-Raider.png" width="600" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Foundry / Robert Strohmeyer</p></div>



<p>On our <em>Metro Exodus</em> average frame rate test, the Blade 15 came in center of the pack with an average frame rate of 51.5. These numbers are solid, but not great, and highlight how settling for a second-tier GPU on such an otherwise high-end machine leads to disappointing results.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage center"><figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img alt="Razer Blade 15 Metro Exodus Avg Framerate" class="wp-image-1682990" height="371" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Razer-Blade-15-OLED-Metro-Exodus-Avg-Framerate.png" width="600" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Foundry / Robert Strohmeyer</p></div>



<h2 id="razer-blade-15-oled-productivity-performance">Razer Blade 15 OLED: Productivity performance</h2>



<p>On PCMark 10, the Blade 15 again fell short of the MSI GE76 Raider, but just barely beat the other machines in the pack. With an overall score of 7,100, the Blade demonstrates very strong, but by no means best-in-class, productivity performance. Still, it&rsquo;s more than anyone needs for day to day business apps and video conferencing. Frankly, if I was looking at a laptop that could pull double duty at the office and the LAN party, I don&rsquo;t care much about sacrificing some productivity-app performance along the way.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage center"><figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img alt="Razer Blade 15 PCMark 10 Overall" class="wp-image-1682993" height="371" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Razer-Blade-15-OLED-PCMark-10-Overall.png" width="600" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Foundry / Robert Strohmeyer</p></div>



<h2><strong>Razer Blade 15 OLED</strong>: Video performance</h2>



<p>While the Blade 15 is generally strong on gaming and productivity performance, it really fell short across all our video performance tests. In our Handbrake 0.9.9 test, rendering a 30GB 1080p MKV file to MP4 to see how it can cool down before it needs to throttle performance, this Razer came in dead last, taking almost twice as long as every other laptop in the field to render the file. We were so surprised we went back to Razer to verify the results, and their technicians reported that this is normal.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage center"><figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img alt="Razer Blade 15 Handbrake 0.9.9" class="wp-image-1682991" height="371" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Razer-Blade-15-OLED-Handbrake-0.9.9.png" width="600" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Foundry / Robert Strohmeyer</p></div>



<p>In our Cinebench R20 multi-threaded test, which tests the performance of all the cores on the CPU working together, the Blade 15 came in last dead last with a score of 4,419 where the rest of the field scored above 6,000.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage center"><figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img alt="Razer Blade 15 Cinebench R20 Multi" class="wp-image-1682989" height="371" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Razer-Blade-15-OLED-Cinebench-R20-Multi-Threaded.png" width="600" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Foundry / Robert Strohmeyer</p></div>



<p>The Blade 15 OLED fared only slightly better on the single-thread Cinebench test, just barely edging out the Acer Predator Helios 300 with a score of 638 to the Acer&rsquo;s 609. Other machines in the lineup scored above 650, and the MSI GE76 Raider again topped the field with a score of 735.</p>

<h2 id="razer-blade-15-oled-battery-life">Razer Blade 15 OLED: Battery life</h2>



<p>Unlike its larger counterpart, the Razer Blade 17, the Blade 15 OLED performed well in our battery test. Playing a 4K movie on repeat until the battery runs out and the machine shuts down, the Blade 15 OLED gave us five hours and 48 minutes of life, which is about average for similar machines we&rsquo;ve tested.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="razer-blade-15-oled-bottom-line">Razer Blade 15 OLED: Bottom line</h2>



<p>At nearly three thousand bucks, the Blade 15 OLED sets high expectations, and at least where its killer display is concerned, it&rsquo;s worth the investment if you really want luxury design and the best display on any 15-inch laptop today. But the market moves fast and this Razer won&rsquo;t be the only system with this screen for long. If you&rsquo;re a sucker for understated design and a beautiful screen at any cost, and you can&rsquo;t wait for the next wave of gaming laptops to come out with similar display tech, this Blade 15 is a very worthy machine. If you want top performance, on the other hand, look elsewhere.</p>
