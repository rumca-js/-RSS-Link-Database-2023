Win your very own ChronosV3 Desktop PC challenge-free at https://www.originpc.com/landing/2023/linus-chronos-giveaway/ (Link will be live soon!)\n\nOrigin PC sent us a white Chronos V3 gaming pc complete with an Intel i9-13900K process and an RTX 4080 GPU, but they told us we weren\u2019t allowed to keep it. Of course, we don\u2019t plan to give it back to them either, so we broke it good and invited our subscriber Calvin down to try to fix it. We told him he\u2019d get to keep this beautiful, compact gaming rig IF he could get it in working order in under 2 hours. Will he succeed, or will we have to find someone else to take this compact ivory obelisk off our hands?\n\nIntel Core i9-13900K Processor: https://geni.us/Pr7AyZz\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 16GB GPU: https://geni.us/Lp07wc\nCorsair Vengeance DDR5 32GB (2x16GB) 5600MHz C36 RAM: https://geni.us/Ya6hr2\nASUS ROG STRIX X670E-I Motherboard: https://geni.us/yw1AIMb\nCorsair iCue H150i RGB Elite Liquid CPU Cooler: https://geni.us/KBk4Up\nCorsair SF Series PSU: https://geni.us/BiE72\n\nPurchases made through some store links may provide some compensation to Linus Media Group.\n\nDiscuss on the forum: https://linustechtips.com/topic/1499885-if-you-can-fix-this-pc-it%E2%80%99s-yours/\n\n\u25ba GET MERCH: https://lttstore.com\n\u25ba LTX 2023 TICKETS AVAILABLE NOW: https://lmg.gg/ltx23\n\u25ba GET EXCLUSIVE CONTENT ON FLOATPLANE: https://lmg.gg/lttfloatplane\n\u25ba SPONSORS, AFFILIATES, AND PARTNERS: https://lmg.gg/partners\n\u25ba OUR WAN PODCAST GEAR: https://lmg.gg/wanset\n\nFOLLOW US \n---------------------------------------------------  \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/linustech\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/LinusTech\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/linustech\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@linustech\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/linustech\n\nMUSIC CREDIT\n---------------------------------------------------\nIntro: Laszlo - Supernova\nVideo Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKfxmFU3lWY\niTunes Download Link: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/supernova/id936805712\nArtist Link: https://soundcloud.com/laszlomusic\n\nOutro: Approaching Nirvana - Sugar High\nVideo Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngsGBSCDwcI\nListen on Spotify: http://spoti.fi/UxWkUw\nArtist Link: http://www.youtube.com/approachingnirvana\n\nIntro animation by MBarek Abdelwassaa https://www.instagram.com/mbarek_abdel/\nMonitor And Keyboard by vadimmihalkevich / CC BY 4.0  https://geni.us/PgGWp\nMechanical RGB Keyboard by BigBrotherECE / CC BY 4.0 https://geni.us/mj6pHk4\nMouse Gamer free Model By Oscar Creativo / CC BY 4.0 https://geni.us/Ps3XfE\n\nCHAPTERS\n---------------------------------------------------\n0:00 FYI, the PC wasn't like this when we received it\n0:10 If you can fix it, you can have it!\n1:07 START!\n2:23 Rules to win\n5:09 30 min. mark\n9:34 1 hour mark\n11:19 Compromise?
