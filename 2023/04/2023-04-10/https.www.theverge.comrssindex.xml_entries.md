  <p id="gQhcM5">Last week, SpaceX announced it’s poised to launch the <a href="https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/1644044484026716160">fully stacked</a> Starship spacecraft for a first orbital flight test following a launch rehearsal this week and pending regulatory approval. Now SpaceX CEO Elon Musk is <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1644944993499357184">confirming</a> it’s ready, with launch “trending towards near the end of third week of April,” Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1645418134021500933">wrote in a tweet on Monday</a>.</p>
<p id="SKuIEr">Starship is SpaceX’s long-awaited flagship spacecraft that’s designed to take astronauts and payloads to deep space — including the Moon and, of course, Mars. Most importantly, the parts are designed to be reusable, and it is paired with a massive booster known as the Super Heavy to get it off the Earth’s surface. </p>

The mines — which are giant data farms — use vastly more electricity than the communities surrounding them, driving up pollution from coal and gas power plants.

  <p id="8Fl27W">On Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Agency plans to announce tough new tailpipe emission standards designed to effectively force the auto industry to phase out the sale of gas-powered cars. It’s an ambitious — and risky — move by the Biden administration to cement its climate goals by boosting the sale of electric vehicles while also ushering in the end of the era of the internal combustion engine (ICE). </p>
<p id="k0rtPt">But it won’t be as easy as banning the sale of gas-powered cars or mandating that companies only sell vehicles with electric powertrains. Rather, the new EPA rules would set an emissions limit on the total number of new cars each automaker sells in a year. That limit would essentially ensure that two-thirds of vehicles they sold...</p>

  <p id="xzE7i6">Mastodon has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23658648/mastodon-ceo-twitter-interview-elon-musk-twitter">one of the biggest beneficiaries</a> of Twitter’s ongoing meltdown, and since I started seriously using it late last year, it’s won me over. While I still use Twitter for monitoring news and talking to the occasional source, Mastodon is <a href="https://mastodon.social/@thedextriarchy">my new home</a> for shortform posting. But Mastodon has one significant problem: it’s very<em> </em>annoying to find things I like.</p>
<p id="BG6L8j">I’m not talking about “discoverability” in the sense of some tailored suggestion algorithm. I mean that by design, information on Mastodon’s many servers is diffuse and relatively obscure. Back on Twitter, I kept several columns of search terms open — some for serious topics I was covering, some for personal interests like my favorite games, all of them a potential gateway...</p>

  <p id="4s8DGM">A Texas judge ruled on Friday that the Food and Drug Administration improperly approved the abortion-facilitating pill mifepristone more than 20 years ago, just as a Washington state judge issued a directly conflicting ruling — setting up a likely Supreme Court fight and potentially threatening nationwide access to reproductive healthcare.</p>
<p id="woaEmq">In Texas, District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txnd.370067/gov.uscourts.txnd.370067.137.0_15.pdf">issued a long-awaited decision</a> on a suit from the Alliance Defending Freedom, which filed on behalf of antiabortion medical groups and doctors against the FDA. Kacsmaryk — nominated by former President Donald Trump — ruled largely in the group’s favor. While he didn’t outright reverse the FDA’s decision, he issued a stay that’s supposed to revert mifepristone...</p>
