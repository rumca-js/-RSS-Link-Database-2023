Initially, Gargoyles was a massive risk for Disney.  Known for their squeaky clean children's programming, Disney was not known for darker more mature stories in their shows.  But during the rise of Batman the Animated Series, Disney needed a show to compete, and that show was Gargoyles.  Gargoyles was not only a home run, but years later still has a big fan base.
