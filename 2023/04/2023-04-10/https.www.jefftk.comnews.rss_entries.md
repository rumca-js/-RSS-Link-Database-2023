Here's a pattern that doesn't work very well: a tragedy catches our
attention, we point to statistics to show it's an example of a
distressingly common problem, and we propose laws to address the
issue.  Except the event is rarely representative of the larger
problem, and so these policy changes won't help much with the issues
reflected in the statistics.  Instead, we should combine the anger and
passion the tragedy evokes with a deeper interpretation of the
statistics to identify what changes we most need.

<p>

For example, with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Covenant_School_shooting">recent
Nashville school shooting</a> a lot of people are giving statistics
like how there were <a href="https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/past-tolls">600+ mass
shootings</a> and <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/school-shootings-this-year-how-many-and-where/2022/01">51
school shootings</a> in 2022, or how guns are now the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2023/04/06/gun-deaths-among-us-kids-rose-50-percent-in-two-years/">largest
cause of death for children</a>.  But let's look into the kind of
events these statistics represent.

</p>

<p>

The Gun Violence Archive maintains a <a href="https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/reports/mass-shooting">listing
of mass shootings</a>: incidents in which at least four people are
shot.  They link news stories for each, and while they're frustrating
and depressing they're very rarely "someone senselessly shoots up an
elementary school".  Instead they're people fighting and one of them
<a href="https://www.live5news.com/2023/04/08/2-arrests-made-after-iop-beach-shooting-city-council-holds-emergency-meeting/">pulls
out a gun</a>, people arguing at a park and then escalating to <a href="https://www.fox8live.com/2023/04/07/4-shot-including-2-juveniles-i-10-new-orleans-east/">shooting
on the highway</a>, or a targeted attack <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/news/philadelphia-shooting-kensington-rorer-street/">at
a garage</a>.  In half of the incidents exactly four people are shot,
since most shootings are fewer people and the cutoff is four.

</p>

<p>

Education Week maintains a <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/school-shootings-this-year-how-many-and-where/2022/01">listing
of school shootings</a>: incidents in which at least one person is
shot on school property or a school bus.  Looking over them they're
again mostly not the kind that makes national news.  Two
teenagers fighting in the schoolyard and one of them <a href="http://pgpolice.blogspot.com/2022/12/teenage-suspect-wanted-for-shooting-at.html">has
a gun</a>, a drug deal between two armed people in a school parking
lot <a href="https://www.kalb.com/2022/11/15/2-people-shot-near-camp-livingston-road-ball/">escalates
into a shooting</a>, or an adult was shot in their car in the school
parking lot <a href="https://www.wlbt.com/2022/11/12/hinds-county-deputies-investigate-shooting-parking-lot-after-raymond-high-basketball-game/">after
a basketball game</a>.

</p>

<p>

If you look at the Nashville school shooting, or others that have made
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting">especially
large</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robb_Elementary_School_shooting">impacts
nationally</a>, they're attacks against younger kids.  And hearing the
"number one cause of death among children" statistic you might think
this is common.  But "children" here is being used literally to mean
"under 18": 47% of those dying were 17, and 76% were 16 or 17. Only
18% were under 15:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>

None of this is to minimize the suffering and loss these shootings
represent: ten incidents in which four people die isn't better than
one in which forty die, and someone dying at 17 isn't more acceptable
than dying at 9.  All of these deaths are too many.  But if we're
going to make things better, we need to target our responses to the
common cases, and not the unusual ones that make the news.

</p>

<p>

Here's the demographic breakdown:

</p>

<p>

And as a proportion of deaths at each age:

</p>

<p>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/firearm-homicide-death-fraction-rate-by-age-and-race-and-gender-big.png"><img class="mobile-fullwidth" height="413" src="https://www.jefftk.com/firearm-homicide-death-fraction-rate-by-age-and-race-and-gender.png" width="550" /><div class="image-vertical-spacer"></div></a>

</p>

<p>

That the impact of these shootings so strongly reinforces existing
disadvantage makes the misplaced focus especially tragic.

</p>

<p>

Translating this into policies, the <a href="https://www.theolympian.com/news/politics-government/article274115110.html">efforts</a>
to re-ban <a href="https://joebiden.com/gunsafety/">assault rifles</a>
don't make sense: gun homicides are overwhelmingly from handguns.
Same with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_flag_law">red
flag laws</a>, where a judge can order someone's guns confiscated,
since most of the homicides are via illegally possessed guns which
could already be confiscated.  An approach of <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-illegally-carried-handguns-are">enforcing
existing laws on handgun possession</a>, however, making it less likely that
teenagers and young adults who get into fights will be armed, is the
kind of policy that fits the bulk of the problem, and sounds much more
likely to make an impact.
