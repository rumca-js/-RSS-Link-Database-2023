  <p id="XGuoCO">Bungie is the latest online game developer to announce <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/twab-04-13-2023-best-dressed">it’ll start monitoring, warning, and even banning Destiny 2 players</a> who use controller-spoofing XIM hardware or similar to cheat. The company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/4/23669939/call-of-duty-warzone-xim-ban-suspension-warning">told <em>The Verge</em></a> in February that it was investigating ways to combat cheaters, and now its policy is drawing a clear line on what won’t be allowed. The move comes as other big online games, from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/4/23669939/call-of-duty-warzone-xim-ban-suspension-warning"><em>Call of Duty</em></a> to <em>Overwatch,</em> are also adopting methods to try to detect the hardware and either mess with or outright ban players using them.</p>
<p id="qqicPH"><a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/twab-04-13-2023-best-dressed">In its blog post today</a>, Bungie notes that “external aides” are a problem that the community is growing frustrated with — while avoiding actually mentioning the names of the devices to deter spotlighting them. </p>

  <p id="c8Nes5">EA on Thursday released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNP3ztvNBFI">a new trailer</a> for <em>Immortals of Aveum</em>, a single-player “first-person magic shooter” the company is publishing under its EA Originals label. The game is being developed by Ascendant Studios, which is “made up of BAFTA and Game of the Year award-winning industry veterans,” <a href="https://news.ea.com/press-releases/press-releases-details/2023/EA-and-Ascendant-Studios-Unveil-Immortals-of-Aveum-an-All-New-Single-Player-Magic-Shooter-Launching-July-20-2023/default.aspx">according to a press release</a>.</p>
<p id="NcwmY4">Based only on the trailer, it’s hard to tell exactly what to expect with <em>Immortals of Aveum</em> outside of a standard saving-the-world plot — the characters use a lot of in-world jargon. But here’s EA and Ascendant’s official description of the game from the press release:</p>
<blockquote><p id="A0Ls8r">Players experience this visceral and cinematic, story-driven game through the eyes of Jak, as he joins an elite order of battlemages, masters all three...</p></blockquote>

  <p id="jSmNgN">You could be forgiven at this point for not believing <em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em> is ever coming out. Rocksteady Studios, of <em>Batman: Arkham</em> series fame, has delayed the game yet again. This is the second time the game has been delayed this year and the third overall, taking the release date from 2022 to May 26th, 2023, to some later date in 2023 to, now, February 2nd, 2024. </p>
<p id="jUOElF">Earlier this year, <em>Suicide Squad</em> was heavily featured in Sony’s February State of Play. It was the first time players had an up-close look at the gameplay, and they were... less than enthused. Turns out, an always online, live service shooter with a battle pass is just not what people want right now. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/3/23584877/ea-meta-live-service-game-shutdowns-apex-legends-mobile-rumbleverse-knockout-city">Who’da thunk</a>?</p>

  <p id="DKWu6i">Amazon is making its AI-powered coding assistant free for individual developers, undercutting the $10 per month pricing of its Microsoft-made rival. In <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-codewhisperer-free-for-individual-use-is-now-generally-available/">a post shared on Thursday</a>, Amazon announced that its CodeWhisperer tool is now available to everyone who <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/">signs up to use it</a>.</p>
<p id="FRU2qi"><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/introducing-amazon-codewhisperer-the-ml-powered-coding-companion/">Amazon launched CodeWhisperer as a preview last year</a>, which developers can use within various integrated development environments (IDEs), like Visual Studio Code, to generate lines of code based on a text-based prompt. While it was originally only made available to Amazon Web Services customers, the newly announced free tier should make it much more accessible to developers who don’t use AWS.</p>

  <p id="lQC9WL">Arkansas is now the second US state to impose minimum age restrictions on social media, with Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders signing in a new bill on Wednesday that requires parents and guardians to consent to people under 18 opening a new account. The newly approved <a href="https://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/Bills/Detail?id=SB396&amp;ddBienniumSession=2023%2F2023R">SB 396</a> — otherwise dubbed the Social Media Safety Act — comes into effect in September and aims to protect minors in online spaces.</p>

<p id="tlwZNy">The three-minute trailer featured sweeping vistas of Hyrule, some new friendly faces, and one very old not-so-friendly face. It looks like Link will have some friends to help him along the way, like he did in <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, which is neat because exploring all of Hyrule alone can get pretty boring. It also looks like my girl Riju is back and all grown up, along with Prince Sidon, so I am <em>very</em> excited to see my old friends again.</p>

<p id="M7K2Um">The music festival will be featured inside of the game in a few different ways. Perhaps most notable is the “Coachella Island” that players can explore, built using the game’s Creative mode, and which features music from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/14/23205064/porter-robinson-interview-league-of-legends">Porter Robinson</a>, some mini-games to play, and a virtual merch tent. (The island will be available to check out starting on April 14th at 3PM ET.)</p>
<p id="B1LNZK">Meanwhile, 18 different songs from Coachella artists will be playing on <em>Fortnite</em>’s in-game radio station in the battle royale mode from now until May 12th. There will also be Coachella-themed quests to complete and, since this is <em>Fortnite</em>, a pair of...</p>

  <p id="DXp7dC">Everything about Apple’s newest streaming series is extreme — which you can probably tell since it’s a show about wine with the overly dramatic title <em>Drops of God</em>. And yet it works. It takes what may seem like a niche subculture full of snobs and millionaires and turns it into a high-stakes thriller that constantly kept me on edge. I really can’t believe how tense I got watching someone sniff a glass of red wine.</p>
<p id="HXEwFj">Loosely based on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drops_of_God">manga of the same name</a>, <em>Drops of God</em> is a story about family and competition. Things really kick off with a death.
