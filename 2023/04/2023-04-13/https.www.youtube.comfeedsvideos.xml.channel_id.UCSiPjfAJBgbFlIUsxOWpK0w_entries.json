Sara Niemietz & Moira Mack", "description": "Hip hip for this cover of Island in the Sun, because I really did feel transported to an island beach somewhere with an umbrella in my fancy fruity drink. There were so many great moments throughout this song! Swatty\u2019s high ditty on the keys made the whole song sound playful. Moira\u2019s and Sara\u2019s voices are so smooth and blend incredibly well, keeping everything mellow and relaxed. And Nick Campbell on the bass!?! He rarely needs introduction, but Jack\u2019s countdown led to such a great drum and bass section by Nick and Ben that I was hooked by the time Brian\u2019s guitar section came in. Such a fun cover, it\u2019ll be on everyone\u2019s summer music playlists!\n\nSave this song on Spotify: https://spoti.fi/3Th94Ql \nFollow us on instagram: https://instagram.com/pomplamoosemusic\nBecome a patron of our music (to vote on the songs we cover and get merch and stuff like that): http://www.patreon.com/pomplamoose\n\nA cover of Weezer's \"Island in the Sun\" by Magaziine ft.
