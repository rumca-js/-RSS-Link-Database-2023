<p>Labour deputy leader says intention behind attack ad against Rishi Sunak was to capture public’s attention   </p><p><strong>Chris Philp</strong>, the policing minister, has been giving interviews this morning, and he told LBC he was “deeply concerned” about figures showing <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/mobile-phone-thefts-robbery-london-police-crime-b1073286.html">one mobile phone is reported stolen in London every six minutes.</a> He said:</p><p>I’m concerned, deeply concerned, by those figures as a Londoner. As you say, it probably applies in other cities as well. That’s precisely why we’re recruiting all these extra police officers locally, so once they’re all through their training, being able to protect the streets to prevent these crimes in the first place and then follow up afterwards.</p><p>I think they’re really hard hitting, and I think there’s a reason why. It has caught the public’s attention, and that’s what our intention was – to ensure the public do see that the prime minister, and the Conservatives for the last 30 years, have failed to tackle serious crime and have let criminals off the hook.

And I think it’s right that we’ve highlighted that.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/apr/13/rishi-sunak-keir-starmer-labour-attack-ad-angela-rayner-politics-live">Continue reading...</a>
