The Nintendo video game franchise had become a massive worldwide phenomenon, so it only made sense for Hollywood to try and cash in on it. The Super Mario Bros movie was the first movie based on a video game ever made, and it did not exactly inspire confidence in the genre.\n\nStarring Bob Hoskins, John Leguizamo, Dennis Hopper and Samantha Mathis, the movie is completely bonkers and raises a whole lot of questions. Like how did dinosaurs also evolve into humans? Why do none of the characters have anything to do with their video game counterparts? Why did they go all-in on the plumbing aspect? Why does President Koopa not just go through the portal? How did they think this would get a SEQUEL?!\n\nTo answer all these questions and more, step inside the pitch meeting that led to Super Mario Bros! It\u2019ll be super easy, barely an inconvenience.\n\n\n#SuperEasyBarelyAnInconvenience\n\nCheck Out These Other Videos:\n\nVelma Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4K_sxI5Ui8\n\nAvatar The Way Of Water Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJBPO76TGUQ\n\nOur Social Media:\nhttps://twitter.com/screenrant\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant\n\nOur Website\nhttp://screenrant.com/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVsNLDmvViA", "date_published": "2023-04-13 19:00:03+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
