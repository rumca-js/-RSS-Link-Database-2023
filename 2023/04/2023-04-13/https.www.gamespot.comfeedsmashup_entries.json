Final Fantasy XVI releases exclusively on PS5 on <strong>June 22</strong>. The latest <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-xvi-state-of-play-start-time-and-how-to-watch/1100-6513180/\">State of Play</a> livestream provided a fresh look at the fast-paced and stylish combat. If you're looking forward to picking up one of the biggest PS5 games of the year, you can <strong><a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1801334714837349343?u1=subid_value\">preorder Final Fantasy XVI</a></strong> now. Ordering early will ensure you get multiple in-game bonuses, and you can also secure exclusive preorder bonuses at select retailers. </p><p>Here's a closer look at all three editions of Final Fantasy XVI: Standard, Deluxe, and <a href=\"https://store.na.square-enix-games.com/en_US/product/810774/final-fantasy-xvi-collector-s-edition-ps5\">Collector's--which is back in stock</a> but could sell out soon.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Final Fantasy XVI Preorder Bonuses</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1702/17023653/4076318-ff16preorderbonuses.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Preorder bonuses are a bit confusing for Final Fantasy XVI. Three different in-game items are available, but whether you get them depends both on where you preorder the game and which version you opt for. Just about every retailer is offering the Cat Sith Charm (which boosts the rate at which you gain Gil) along with the Braveheart weapon, but the Scholar\u2019s Spectacles item (which boosts XP gain) is only available with the following editions:</p><ul><li>Collector\u2019s Edition</li><li>Deluxe Edition (Digital)</li><li>Standard Edition (Digital)</li></ul><p>In other words, you\u2019ll want to pay close attention to the fine print when preordering FFXVI to ensure you\u2019re getting the best bonuses at your preferred retailer.</p><p>Multiple retailers also have exclusive preorder bonuses for Final Fantasy XVI. If you <strong><a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1801334714837349343?u1=subid_value\">preorder any edition from Best Buy, you'll receive an exclusive steelbook case</a></strong>. Meanwhile, <strong><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=VZfI20jEa0c&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=subid_value&amp;murl=https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/playstation-5/products/final-fantasy-xvi---playstation-5/357774.html\">physical editions at GameStop come with Realms of Valisthea patches</a></strong>. If you're interested in either of these bonuses, we'd recommend ordering ASAP. And if you'd rather get some cash back, <strong><a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/1804712/81938/2092?subId1=subid_value&amp;u=https://www.target.com/p/final-fantasy-xvi-playstation-5/-/A-88183537\">Target is giving away $10 gift cards with preorders</a></strong> of either edition.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Preorder Final Fantasy XVI Standard Edition</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1702/17023653/4076319-ff16standardedition.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p><strong>$70</strong></p><p>Looking for the cheapest way to pick up Final Fantasy XVI?

The State of Play focused on the combat of Final Fantasy XVI, some of the story and side content, and the massive Eikon fights.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">This new video showcased the real-time action combat, which is relatively new for the franchise. Snippets of Clive, the main character, fighting enemies on the ground were shown, as well as the battles where you control the Eikon, the massive summons in the game. The action is all in real time and Clive will learn a ton of different abilities and attacks from the different Eikons in the world, allowing players to adapt the combat to their own playstyle. These abilities can be found in a massive skill tree, which allows you to reset those abilities at any time and even let the game pick your abilities for you.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The massive Eikon versus Eikon fights can play out in a number of different ways, with one shown featuring a third-person shooting sequence and others feeling similar to an all-out wrestling match. Square Enix said that each Ekion battle would feel unique and be based around the specific Eikons fighting.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-xvi-state-of-play-showcases-real-time-combat-and-world-exploration/1100-6513260/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-xvi-state-of-play-showcases-real-time-combat-and-world-exploration/1100-6513260/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-04-13 21:35:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Best Buy Has A Bunch Of Great Gaming and Tech Deals Right Now", "description": "<p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1595/15950357/4125377-bestbuy.jpeg\" /><br /><h3><p>Best Buy is running an <span class=\"norewrite\">           <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1805409555201748351?u1=subid_value\">impressive sale</a> </span> right now, with a long list of gaming laptops, monitors, arcade cabinets, games, and other gaming accessories available at steep discounts.

More than a decade of Marvel Studios movies have trained many viewers to see bigger films through those glasses. That's why it's so refreshing to see a movie like <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/see-nicolas-cage-as-dracula-in-first-renfield-trailer/1100-6510331/\">Renfield</a>, which is full of the action, comedy, and ridiculous gore the trailers have been promising, without having to also worry about missing a post-credits scene or a nod to a potential future movie. It's entirely self-contained about Count Dracula's (Nicolas Cage) familiar, Renfield (Nicholas Hoult), which is exactly how writer Robert Kirkman wanted the story to be told.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Speaking to GameSpot, Kirkman readily admitted that he loves the Marvel Cinematic Universe and other large film franchises. Still, he adds, \"It [has] kind of done to death now where [at] the end of the movie, they kind of give you a preview of the movie you wish you would have been watching the whole time.\"</p><p dir=\"ltr\">And he's not wrong. As exciting as every new Marvel or DC movie is, in the back of your mind, you're wondering what's going to happen at the end to set up the next several films, rather than just taking the time to bask in what you're watching.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/renfield-isnt-here-to-kick-off-a-cinematic-universe-and-writer-robert-kirkman-couldnt-be-happier-about-it/1100-6513259/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/renfield-isnt-here-to-kick-off-a-cinematic-universe-and-writer-robert-kirkman-couldnt-be-happier-about-it/1100-6513259/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-04-13 19:57:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Get A 1TB SSD For PlayStation 5 Today Only", "description": "<p>Looking to upgrade your PS5 storage capacity?

Nintendo and Illumination Studio will more than likely continue their blossoming working relationship with both Shigeru Miyamoto and Chris Meledandri sure they'll come together again down the line.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Nintendo has a vast library of games spanning 40 years, with some of them being Easter eggs in the Super Mario movie. Video game movie adaptations are nothing new, but taking these games to the world of animation features could bring a new audience around once again to these legendary titles.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Super Mario Bros. already had two short-lived animated series, Donkey Kong and the spherical and whimsical Kirby also had their own respective series, but what about movies? What properties should this collaboration between Nintendo and Illumination look towards to make their next blockbuster? Let's look at a few examples of what could make really fun movies that they need to make next.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Luigi's Mansion</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15976769/4125325-luigis-mansion-3-egad.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir=\"ltr\">This feels almost obvious about where they should go next after the sequel. This was a Mario spin-off that put a spotlight on the younger Mario brother as he investigates a haunted mansion to find Mario and his friends. The latest Luigi's Mansion game came out on Halloween 2019 and quickly became one of the Nintendo Switch's highest-rated titles.</p><p>We saw the wispy menace King Boo near the end of the movie so we know he exists in this world. With King Boo being the main antagonist in the Luigi's Mansion series, this feels like the most probable of Nintendo movies to come. Even Luigi's voice, Charlie Day, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/seth-rogen-chris-pratt-and-charlie-day-all-want-mario-x-metroid/1100-6513085/\">wants a chance to bust some ghosts</a>.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Legend of Zelda</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15976769/4125326-0813d7ab-694f-42fb-8ee0-6901ea24d1fd-links_awakening_main.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>It's strange that Zelda hasn't hit the theaters or even a Netflix limited series, right? High-fantasy elements, beloved characters, rich mythos, what's not to like? Link, Zelda, and Ganon were featured as back-ups in the Super Mario Bros. Super Show on Friday's episodes, but nothing outside of that. Link and the rest of the denizens of Hyrule (maybe even Koholint Island) deserve their time in time in the sun, too--maybe even hot Ganondorf.</p><p>The thing about The Legend of Zelda is that there are already a multitude of stories to choose from and what timeline you could bring to the big screen. If you want something more kid-oriented, go down the Windwaker path, or even Link's Awakening. Both have characters that would translate well to a kid's movie, especially if you want to add the trading sidequest where you get folks like Chef Bear and her kitchen. There have been rumors circulating for years now, but there's never been a better time to get this into motion.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Metroid</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15976769/4125328-metroiddread-review-blogroll-1633478602333.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Samus and her galaxy of enemies at one point were headed to theaters helmed by director John Woo in the early 2000s, but that starship has long since sailed. It was announced back in January that the rights to a Metroid film were optioned off, but no director or even studio has been said to be attached. Samus' latest adventure, Metroid Dread, is the best-selling Metroid game of all time and the perfect blueprint for a feature film.</p><p>The world of Metroid is prime real estate\u2013pun intended\u2013for Illumination's next big thing and could break that barrier into an older audience. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>The Koopalings</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15976769/4125330-bowser-and-the-koopalings-marios-greatest-foe.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>How Illumination turned the Minions into weird pop culture icons that are used from bad Facebook memes to ecards to even their own movie is so interesting. It makes you wonder, though, if the success could be repeated again with Nintendo's own problem progeny: the Koopalings. Bowser's Koopa Kids were introduced back in Super Mario Bros. 3 and soon added to the Super Mario World animated series, but with different names (eg, Wendy became Cutie-Pie for some reason). A movie featuring the kids causing chaos throughout the Mushroom Kingdom or maybe even on Earth is the type of fare Illumination made their house with and seems like a logical fit.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Star Fox</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15976769/4125331-maxresdefault%281%29.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Every studio wants to have its own Star Wars/Guardians of the Galaxy-esque property, and Fox McCloud and company could be just the thing for Nintendo and Illumination. Created by video game legend Shigeru Miyamoto, Star Fox was released in February 1993 on the Super Nintendo with groundbreaking graphics for the time and delivered a classic arcade experience at home. The story centers around ace pilot Fox and his team of Slippy, Falco, and Peppy taking on the villainous Andross and protecting the Lytat system. It's one of Nintendo's most critically-acclaimed IPs that hasn't had any sort of animated or live-action series or movies but has been adapted into a few manga series.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Splatoon</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15976769/4125334-splatoon-3-1662492917051.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>One of Nintendo's newest franchises, Splatoon was released back on the Wii U in 2015 and spawned two sequels. The series has been such a huge success it even established its own esports tournament circuit in 2018. It's also spun off into a manga series and its own holographic concerts in Japan. The story is malleable enough to give it depth for a movie with the main story centering around the rivalry between two rival races known as Inklings and Octolings. The idea behind Splatoon is basically paintball across large-scale levels with whoever gets the most coverage wins the game. Focusing a film on a Turf War battle between two teams writes itself and could be easy money for Illumination and Nintendo.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Animal Crossing</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15976769/4125335-animal_crossing_new_horizons_isabelle.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Talk about a game so open-world, you can insert yourself into it. Animal Crossing burst onto the scene back in 2001 and has become one of Nintendo's top-selling franchises of all time. It's accessible to any player and can be picked up and played with ease. There are no bosses, and no stressful tasks, simply a game you can play at your own leisure if you need a quick getaway from life. The series has spawned both a manga and an anime back in 2006 based on the DS game and sequel, Wild World, but with the success of New Horizons on the Switch, Illumination could do wonders with these lovable characters we've come to know over 20 years.</p></h3></p><br />", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/after-super-mario-bros-here-are-7-movies-nintendo-should-make/2900-4717/", "date_published": "2023-04-13 18:59:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Ubisoft Explains Why Ubisoft+ Can Succeed Without Being Bundled With Game Pass", "description": "<p>Ubisoft has shed more light on its game subscription program, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-plus-launches-xbox/1100-6513235/\">Ubisoft +</a>, including why the company believes the <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-plus-launches-xbox/1100-6513235/\">Xbox version</a> can succeed on its own as opposed to being bundled with Game Pass.

Even though the EA Original is set to launch this year, developer Ascendant Studios has kept details about its upcoming first-person shooter close to the chest these past few months. I finally got a chance to see what the game looks like in action during a preview event, and it appears to be just the game to scratch my itch for a story-driven single-player shooter. Plus, Gina Torres (<a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/\">Destiny 2</a>'s Ikora Rey and Transformers: Prime's Airachnid) voices one of the main characters, and my geeky little heart is ecstatic.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In Immortals of Aveum, you play as Jak, a person who discovers he's Unforeseen--which is a fancy way of saying you unexpectedly develop magic powers as an adult way later than most people do. He also discovers he has the special talent of being able to wield all forces of magic, chaining different abilities together in devastating combinations.
