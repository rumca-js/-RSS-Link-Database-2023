The scammer then asks for personal information or tries to get the viewer to register for something. I decided to scam the scammer by pretending to be someone else and engaging them in conversation to see how they go about scamming people. The conversation involved the scammer recommending various investment opportunities in crypto, real estate, silver, and gold, with promises of a high daily profit percentage based on the viewer\u2019s startup capital. The scammer provided a website link for the viewer to sign up and invest, which could potentially harm their computer with a memory leak. Key takeaways include being cautious of unsolicited messages and links from unknown sources, researching investment opportunities thoroughly before investing, and being vigilant of scams to protect personal information and finances.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TotfPIIQyZE", "date_published": "2023-04-13 23:18:47+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
