Controlling Clive, you'll encounter these various Eikons and have to battle against them to win their favor, and have them join your side. While that isn't a new element to Final Fantasy games, what is new is the ability to fully control these Eikons, and use them to help battle against other Eikons. As shown in this trailer, these Eikon battles will completely change the overall gameplay, and merge seamlessly with the normal battle structure. Expect to see classic summons like Ifrit, Titan, Bahamut, Phoenix, Typhon, and more once FFXVI releases on June 22, 2023.  \n\n#finalfantasy16 #finalfantasy #gaming \n\nTimestamps\nIntro 0:00\nClive Gameplay 0:10\nEikon Gameplay 4:38", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3SusG-m8nI", "date_published": "2023-04-13 22:07:53+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Final Fantasy XVI Full Gameplay Presentation | State of Play April 2023", "description": "State of Play returns with an extended look at Final Fantasy XVI, the highly anticipated action-RPG arriving on PS5 June 22.
