If \"The Office\" were on the air today, Dwight would be walking around like The Boy in the Bubble to make sure he didn't catch the schmaronavirus.</p><p>Though to be charitable to Wilson, wearing a mask in a public place prevents people from pestering him with questions about beet farming and what a terrible lay Angela was.

It was the most popular streaming show during the pandemic.
