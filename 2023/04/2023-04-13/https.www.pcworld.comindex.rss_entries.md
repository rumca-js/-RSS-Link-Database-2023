<p>Someone inside of Microsoft is thinking about how to make a hyper-tailored version of Windows designed to run on Steam Deck-like handheld devices. Because, well, <em>duh</em>&mdash;of course that&rsquo;s happening.</p>



<p>First, some key details. The &ldquo;Windows Handheld Mode&rdquo; videos shared by prolific Microsoft leaker <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/_h0x0d_/status/1646339289230483458&amp;xcust=2-3-1785380-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">WalkingCat</a> are from a pitch created for an internal hackathon, <em>not</em> a proper Microsoft project. It very well may never see the light of day. It focuses on key features a Windows-powered Steam Deck rival would need such as an optimized onboarding experience, game launcher, driver handling, and more. The videos, embedded below, are definitely worth watching.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>The only surprising thing about this leak is that it&rsquo;s from a hackathon.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We looked at taking some of the first steps in creating a truly optimized Windows experience for the handheld PC market, a market that is really just starting to grow right now thanks to a device called the Steam Deck,&rdquo; an unnamed voiceover says in the Windows Handheld Mode video.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/617378/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-the-steam-deck.html">Valve&rsquo;s Steam Deck</a> launched early last year and instantly became the hottest thing in PC gaming, selling over a million units despite being severely supply constrained with long wait times for most of 2022. One firm expects it to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/report-steam-deck-to-pass-3-million-sales-during-2023/&amp;xcust=2-3-1785380-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">top three million sales</a> by the end of 2023. <em>Very </em>few singular PC products hit that level of adoption, much less right out of the gate. Handheld PCs like the Aya Neo existed before but the Steam Deck truly perfected (and essentially created) the market&mdash;and a large part of its success is due to Valve&rsquo;s homebrew SteamOS.</p>



<p>Valve spent years carefully building and tuning SteamOS and its <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394895/what-is-valve-proton-steam-deck-games-software-explained.html">foundational live-or-die Proton Linux software</a> as a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394953/why-does-the-steam-deck-run-linux-blame-windows.html">potential escape hatch after Microsoft&rsquo;s Windows 8 disaster</a>. The entire operating system revolves around making your Steam games run as awesomely as possible on Valve&rsquo;s affordable handheld, on Linux. Sure, you can run Windows on it, but that kind of sucks.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Handheld PCs are red hot. Running Windows on them pours cold water on the fun. And that&rsquo;s Microsoft&rsquo;s core problem. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/707281/cheaper-steam-deck-competitors-are-on-the-way.html">Cheaper Steam Deck rivals are on the way</a>, along with pricier, higher-powered alternatives like the recently revealed <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1680929/asus-takes-on-the-steam-deck-with-its-rog-ally.html">Asus ROG Ally</a>. Since Valve hasn&rsquo;t made the Deck-optimized version of SteamOS available for other PC manufacturers to install, those competitors need to run Windows. That delivers an inherently worse experience than SteamOS right now, putting potential Windows-powered Steam Deck clones behind right out of the gate.</p>



<p>So yes, <em>duh</em>, of course Microsoft is working on a Windows Handheld Mode. It&rsquo;s a bit concerning to see the concept only in hackathon stage as of last September, but hopefully a deeper dive into the project has been assigned by now. The next wave of handheld gaming PCs depends on it&hellip;unless Valve releases SteamOS for other devices first, which would probably be disastrous for Microsoft&rsquo;s ambitions.</p>



<p>But who knows? Microsoft <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/549576/the-windows-11-taskbar-is-an-annoying-step-backward.html">doesn&rsquo;t always make the smartest decisions</a> when it comes to Windows. On a related note, here&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/541452/make-windows-11-look-like-windows-10.html">how to make Windows 11 look like Windows 10</a>.</p>

## Your Steam Deck is about to get more storage space

<p>The Steam Deck does a lot of things well, but if you fill it up with high-end 3D games, you&rsquo;ll soon find its internal storage straining. The most expensive model only has 512GB of space, and even upgrades <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1441884/1tb-sabrent-rocket-2230-ssd-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">like the excellent Sabrent Rocket SSD</a> are limited by the 2230 form factor of the M.2 internal drive. But if an analysis of an upcoming software patch holds true, some of those space-hogging game files are about to shrink in a very satisfying way. </p>

Shader cache is a series of files that the game engine loads along with a game environment to more quickly and accurately render the graphics, among other things, and these little files make up a pretty sizeable chunk of a game&rsquo;s install size on your storage drive. (They&rsquo;re also one of the biggest things that contribute to loading times &mdash; <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1675637/the-last-of-us-pc-port-is-a-disaster-at-launch.html">just ask <em>The Last of Us</em> players</a>.) </p>



<p>Streamlining the way that the cache is implemented for Mesa in OpenGL and Vulkan means more compact shader files, which means more free space on your storage drive and (hopefully) faster loading times for complex 3D games. Exactly how much drive space is saved will depend on how specific games implement the Mesa driver, but it&rsquo;s common enough that anyone with a big enough Steam library should notice a definite savings in space. Hopefully Valve can add the improvements to the Steam Deck&rsquo;s Linux-based operating system sometime this summer. </p>

<p>When the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407558/razer-phone-hands-on.html">Razer Phone</a> created the &ldquo;gaming phone&rdquo; market in 2017, it rolled out with unique features rarely&mdash;if ever&mdash;seen in smartphones: a high refresh rate screen, binned processors, copper vapor chambers, and in-your-face &ldquo;gamer&rdquo; aesthetics. But in the years since, many of those &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; features have trickled down to mainstream phones from companies like Samsung, OnePlus, and many more. Don&rsquo;t be fooled: Despite the mainstream adoption of some of their features, fire-breathing enthusiast devices like the new <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://rog.asus.com/phones/rog-phone-7-ultimate/&amp;xcust=2-1-1781259-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate</a> continue to innovate and offer unique experiences. </p>



<p>Here are three key features that helps the Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate stand out from the mainstream masses, and one feature that falls far behind.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate" class="wp-image-1784400" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DSCF3135_PCW.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>I feel like I&rsquo;m cheating at COD: Mobile using the Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate</p>.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Patrick Murray/Foundry</p></div>



<h2 id="the-asus-rog-phone-7-ultimates-audio-rocks">The Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate&rsquo;s audio rocks</h2>



<p>As an audio engineer by trade, I&rsquo;ve always put great sound at the forefront of my purchasing decisions. Unfortunately, most major smartphones sacrifice on audio. Phones rarely have great speakers, digital to analog converters, or even a headphone jack. On top of that, many people have moved to Bluetooth headphones and prefer slim bezels to big, booming built-in speakers anyway.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate" class="wp-image-1784409" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DSCF3155_PCW.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Videos on PCWorld&rsquo;s YouTube channel never sounded better</p>. </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Patrick Murray/Foundry</p></div>



<p>Then there&rsquo;s the Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate. It sacrifices the thinnest bezels for front-facing stereo speakers that will make your ears quiver. The sound that comes out of this phone blows my mind compared to normal smartphone speakers. And even though I have plenty of headphones, sometimes I don&rsquo;t always want to put something in or on my ears. </p>



<p>The rich-sounding speakers and genius tuning of the ROG Phone is perfect for us audio nerds no matter whether you&rsquo;re gaming or watching videos. Even better, the ROG Phone stubbornly clings to the timeless 3.5mm headphone jack, and with the attached AeroActive Cooler 7 you get another headphone jack available for use in landscape mode. </p>



<h2 id="control-it-your-way">Control it your way</h2>



<p>For serious gaming sessions I don&rsquo;t always want to use the touch screen, pair a Bluetooth controller, or strap on a device like the Razer Kishi. Good news! The Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate offers so many extra control options that it makes my head spin. </p>



<p>The phone features 14 specific control inputs via touch-sensitive buttons as well as 10 different motion control options. Strap on the AeroActive Cooler 7 and you actually get four physical buttons along the back side. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate" class="wp-image-1784399" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DSCF3124_PCW.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>So many control options at your disposal.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Patrick Murray/Foundry</p></div>



<p>Having those extra inputs can make all the difference when you&rsquo;re playing games like <em>Call of Duty: Mobile</em> or <em>Fortnite</em>. Some games don&rsquo;t support controllers whatsoever, or limit them to specific uses, so gaming phones provide a definite advantage as opposed to relying on touchscreen-only methods. </p>



<p>For example, in a typical game of <em>COD: Mobile</em> I map reloading, crouching, aiming down the sights, and firing to four different button presses. This frees up my thumbs to focus on moving my character and aiming on the screen. Without those extra inputs I would have to pause movement with either thumb to press a button to do something like fire, making me a much easier target. So while I don&rsquo;t actually use all of the options available to me  it&rsquo;s awesome to have them in the first place and can allow for super customized setups.</p>



<h2 id="the-asus-rog-phone-7-ultimate-is-cool-as-a-polar-bears-toenails">The Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate is cool as a polar bear&rsquo;s toenails </h2>



<p>Most flagship phones are more than capable of playing the latest games, of course, but they just aren&rsquo;t optimized for it from a cooling standpoint. Keeping that beastly Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip running cool is essential to get maximum performance during gaming. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate" class="wp-image-1784398" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DSCF3137_PCW.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>You can tailor the power and cooling performance to your liking in the included Armoury Crate</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Patrick Murray/Foundry</p></div>



<p>Asus prioritizes performance by continuing to innovate its cooling system in the ROG Phone 7 Ultimate and doing things like placing the hottest components in the center of the device. This spreads heat across the whole phone for more even cooling, while also maximizing the cooling potential (and thus performance) when attaching the AeroActive Cooler 7 to the back of the device. </p>



<p>That upgraded cooler now features a Peltier cooler as well as an AeroActive Portal that further helps the heat dissipation. The upgrade to a Peltier cooler actually makes the AeroActive Cooler 7 a viable accessory compared to past iterations, and uses active cooling to wick away heat from the back of the phone. The AeroActive Portal (only available on the Ultimate version) opens up when the Cooler is attached and allows for more direct airflow to the hottest components. (It&rsquo;s also super fun to watch open.)</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate" class="wp-image-1784397" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DSCF3113_PCW.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The AeroActive Cooler 7 finally makes a serious impact to cooling.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Patrick Murray/Foundry</p></div>



<p>The cooling solutions inside of the ROG Phone 7 Ultimate itself have also been upgraded, specifically with new designs around its vapor chamber and graphite sheets. Improvements with snazzy names like <em>Liquid Return channels </em>and<em> Wick Column Structures</em> honestly go beyond my level of comprehension, but at the end of the day I <em>do</em> notice that this phone stays cool even after long gaming sessions. I know I can push this phone hard and have it not lose any performance despite how long I play. I also know that I don&rsquo;t have to worry about my hands getting hot and sweaty from holding a hot slab for an hour. The same certainly can&rsquo;t be said for every flagship smartphone on the market.</p>



<h2 id="the-camera-isnt-great-though">The camera isn&rsquo;t great though</h2>



<p>With so much to love about the beastly Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate, could it really have an Achilles&rsquo; heel? Unfortunately, it does possess one major downside that would keep me from using this phone daily: the camera. </p>



<p>As a professional photographer and video producer I just can&rsquo;t rely on this camera system to take photos and video the way I would like. While the camera hardware is more than capable, it&rsquo;s the processing that lags behind and just can&rsquo;t keep up with my needs. The photos coming out of the ROG Phone 7 just don&rsquo;t feel natural to life, suffering from things like poor white balance readings, over processed HDR, and liberal amounts of sharpening. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate" class="wp-image-1784396" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DSCF3148_PCW.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The camera system just can&rsquo;t keep up with the best of them.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Adam Patrick Murray/Foundry</p></div>



<p>To be fair, the photo quality of the ROG Phone line has improved over the years. It&rsquo;s not a horrible camera&mdash;it just doesn&rsquo;t come close enough to the other flagship smartphones in its price range and sticks out as a glaring weakness amidst a whole heap of awesomeness. And of course, it really depends on how much you personally care about camera performance in your phone, but it bums me out and I really hope Asus can continue to improve on it.</p>



<p>Regardless of the weak camera performance, the rest of this phone is a beast. The <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://rog.asus.com/phones/rog-phone-7-ultimate/&amp;xcust=2-1-1781259-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate</a> stands out from the crowd with cutting edge features. That&rsquo;s the key, really. Fully loaded, enthusiast-class gaming phones like this help push the entire mobile ecosystem forward, and I&rsquo;m thrilled that manufacturers like Asus continue to innovate in the space. Mainstream phones might not have adopted features like vapor chambers and high refresh rate screens as quickly if gaming phones didn&rsquo;t blaze the trail first. </p>



<p>Now if only we could get at least one headphone jack back on other phones&hellip;</p>

## Digital fingerprinting: The secret, insidious way youâ€™re tracked online

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>By now you probably know that your web activity is tracked at pretty much every step. Things like your IP address, a number associated with your connection to your internet service provider, and cookies, tiny files collected by your web browser, can identify you to websites, advertisers, and anyone who&rsquo;s interested enough in your data to pay for it. But there are far more complex methods of tracking users on the open internet&mdash;ways that can get past even blocked cookies or <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406870/best-vpn-services-apps-reviews-buying-advice.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">an IP address masked with a VPN.</a> </p>



<p>This collection of varied data to groups of users, and sometimes even a single user, is called a digital fingerprint. With a wide enough net cast to collect data through information gathered via websites and advertising, it&rsquo;s possible to get a startlingly accurate picture of what a specific user is doing online, sometimes down to a near-complete history of their web usage. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Check out these <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1526732/10-tricks-to-use-google-search-more-efficiently.html">10 tricks to use Google Search more efficiently</a>.</p></blockquote>



<h2 id="what-a-digital-fingerprint-isnt">What a digital fingerprint isn&rsquo;t </h2>



<p>Despite the allusion to something you might see on a TV show about cops and investigators, a digital fingerprint isn&rsquo;t a single file or point of data. Unlike <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/431095/super-cookies-can-track-you-even-in-private-browsing-mode-researcher-says.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">a tracking cookie</a> or an IP address, it&rsquo;s a wide and varied set of information variables collected from your devices (smartphones, laptops and desktops, even things like smart TVs or appliances) as you use the internet. Combining all of this data together can track a single user and collect a log of their activity. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Line of people using phones, tablet, laptop" class="wp-image-1722051" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/pexels-fauxels-3183177.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Digital fingerprints  can pinpoint specific users by combining a huge variety of data types. </figcaption></figure><a class="imageCredit" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.pexels.com/photo/photo-of-people-using-gadgets-3183177/&amp;xcust=2-1-1684308-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Fauxels/Pexels</a></div>



<p>So, the bad news is there&rsquo;s no magic pill or a single method of blocking a site or an advertiser from collecting all of this data. You can&rsquo;t just turn on Incognito Mode and assume someone can&rsquo;t get to your information. It means that if you want to keep from being monitored, you need to take a systemic approach to protecting your information and your activity. That goes for every device you&rsquo;re using, whenever you&rsquo;re using it. </p>



<h2 id="what-information-is-in-a-digital-fingerprint">What information is in a digital fingerprint? </h2>



<p>What kind of data is being collected? A huge variety, some of which you may never have even imagined was being recorded. Obvious things like the type of web browser and operating system you&rsquo;re using are some of the first steps, but with modern web technology, sites can gather data such as which browser extensions you have installed (like ad blockers or password managers), which programs or apps are installed on your device, the language your system is set to, or even the specific fonts you have installed. </p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s a long, but by no means definitive, list of the different kinds of data that can be combined to form a digital fingerprint: </p>



<ul><li>Your estimated location, gathered from data like IP address, country reporting and your device&rsquo;s time zone setting</li><li>Your device&rsquo;s type, manufacturer, operating system, and even the operating system version number</li><li>Your web browser (reported by its user agent), browser version number, and settings like &ldquo;Do not track&rdquo; and default language </li><li>Your browser&rsquo;s installed plugins and extensions, like a PDF viewer or ad blocker</li><li>Your device&rsquo;s display information, including resolution, size, and even the available display dedicated to the web page itself </li><li>Your device&rsquo;s hardware permissions granted to the browser, like camera control, microphone, or accelerometer </li><li>Your device&rsquo;s basic hardware information, like battery level or available RAM</li><li>Your installed video and audio formats for available media playback </li><li>Your default keyboard layout, and whether you&rsquo;re using a touchscreen or not</li><li>Your installed fonts </li><li>Complex browser information including HTTP headers, available APIs, CSS info, and JavaScript objects </li></ul>



<p>Some tracking systems can get even more complex. For example, an embedded bit of script can query your device&rsquo;s CPU to perform a quick cryptographic function, something it does in less than a second all the time. But by measuring how fast your gadget does the math, and comparing it to all the other devices performing the same test, it can get a benchmark of your processor and guess what type and model it is. </p>



<p>I should point out that there&rsquo;s a reason that all this information is shared in the first place, and it&rsquo;s typically harmless. For example, modern websites need to know your screen size and resolution in order to show you text you can read easily, and format it to fit on your screen so it doesn&rsquo;t cover other elements of the page. But advertisers and other actors have found ingenious ways to collect and combine this data into incredibly complex tracking systems that don&rsquo;t need old-fashioned cookies or IP numbers. </p>



<h2 id="what-can-someone-do-with-my-digital-fingerprint-info">What can someone do with my digital fingerprint info? </h2>



<p>Because modern devices are so complex, and modern always-online users tend to use their computers and gadgets so differently, it&rsquo;s easy to combine all of these data points and narrow them down into small groups of users. In fact, if you&rsquo;ve been using your phone or computer for more than a week or so and you haven&rsquo;t taken specific steps to mask yourself, your digital fingerprint is probably unique&mdash;a collection of data so complex and specific that it points right to you, and only you. </p>



<p>You can test this out with a service like <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://amiunique.org/&amp;xcust=2-1-1684308-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">AmIUnique.org</a> or the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/&amp;xcust=2-1-1684308-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Electronic Frontier Foundation&rsquo;s Cover Your Tracks</a> tool. Unsurprisingly, both of these tools determined that my desktop computer is leaving a completely unique digital fingerprint among more than a quarter million surveyed results. It&rsquo;s possible, and even pretty likely, that an advertiser can pinpoint my unique user profile among all the web traffic on the planet. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Am I unique screenshot" class="wp-image-1723272" height="587" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/amiunique.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">amiunique.org</p></div>



<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean that my digital fingerprint tells specific things about me, personally. It can&rsquo;t know my age, nationality, race, sex, home address, phone number, etc&mdash;at least, not without connecting to some other database of stored information. But what it CAN do is track the websites I visit and what I do there. </p>



<p>That&rsquo;s because websites and advertisers pass digital fingerprints around like trading cards. With a wide enough network collecting from websites and ads, especially the most commonly-visited sites like Google, Amazon, Facebook, YouTube, etc, you can build a nearly-complete record of what specific users are doing on the web. And by extension, you can build a profile of what they&rsquo;re interested in&hellip;and what they might want to buy. </p>



<p>Yup, this all comes back to advertising, the backbone of the modern internet. (Feel free to click on a few of the ads you see on this page, by the way, they keep food on my table.) Now, it&rsquo;s possible for governments, law enforcement agencies, hackers, and other scary people to track individuals using the same techniques. But unless you&rsquo;re incredibly wealthy, someone highly placed in government or industry, or you&rsquo;re on the run from the law, odds are pretty good you won&rsquo;t be individually targeted using these techniques. It&rsquo;s all about the ads, baby. </p>



<p>However, that advertising data <em>can </em>be connected to your personal information, at least if you&rsquo;re logged into any site that has that information available to it. That presents a more moderate danger for things like identity theft or more elaborate attempts at harm, like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406661/sneaky-gmail-phishing-attack-fools-with-fake-google-docs-app.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">phishing</a> or <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.propublica.org/article/whats-a-pig-butchering-scam-heres-how-to-avoid-falling-victim-to-one&amp;xcust=2-1-1684308-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pig butchering</a>. Again, you&rsquo;re more likely to be targeted by this if you&rsquo;re wealthy or important. </p>



<h2 id="how-can-i-protect-my-digital-fingerprint">How can I protect my digital fingerprint? </h2>



<p>Because a digital fingerprint is made up of so many data points, it&rsquo;s pretty hard to completely stop sites and advertisers from tracking you with it. Basics like spoofing your location with a VPN and blocking cookies just won&rsquo;t cut it, though they do make it a lot harder for the tracker to narrow you down to a specific web user. </p>



<p>Blocking JavaScript with a tool like NoScript will restrict a lot of the data points being collected. But just like completely blocking cookies, that can make a lot of websites simply not work, especially more complex web services and tools. Using an ad blocker will also stop some, but not all, fingerprint data collection. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Mullvad browser EFF Cover Your Tracks tool" class="wp-image-1723700" height="768" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/mullvad-browser-eff.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Setting Mullvad to super-safe mode lets me pass the EFF fingerprinting test, but&hellip;</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>Some browsers have systems that try to limit the amount of data accessible for fingerprinting&mdash;Firefox blocks at least some of it, and more privacy-focused browsers like Tor, Brave, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1681126/privacy-browser-from-mullvad-vpn-and-tor-tries-to-erase-your-digital-fingerprint.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Mullvad</a>, and DuckDuckGo either block the data or submit generic, non-specific information so fingerprinting becomes more difficult. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Wordpress editing window PCWorld" class="wp-image-1723433" height="384" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/wordpress-edit.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /><figcaption>When I disable JavaScript, I can&rsquo;t use PCWorld&rsquo;s WordPress editor&hellip;which makes it impossible to do my job. </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>But they aren&rsquo;t perfect. For example, the AmIUnique and EFF tools I mentioned earlier said switching from Chrome to Mullvad made tracking harder, but my desktop PC still gave off a unique user footprint based on my hardware and software. I had to completely disable JavaScript in the settings to pass the tests. But doing so makes YouTube show nothing but grey boxes, and the WordPress interface I use to write articles for PCWorld relies on JavaScript, so this high-security mode isn&rsquo;t really a feasible solution for me. </p>



<h2 id="a-difficult-compromise">A difficult compromise </h2>



<p>Digital fingerprinting has become a commonplace and ubiquitous practice for web advertising. So common, in fact, that it&rsquo;s nearly impossible to use the internet without giving at least some data away, which can be used to create a profile for you and your activity. You can take steps to lower the amount of information collected, but engaging with any sort of complex web service (like an online shop or social network) means sharing at least some data that can be tracked. </p>



<p>The danger in a digital fingerprint isn&rsquo;t immediate&mdash;there&rsquo;s very little risk to targeted advertising, aside from its tendency to be annoying. The potential for mischief occurs when that data is combined with more personal information. And keeping your personal information safe goes back to more basic, practical security measures: keeping as little of that data in as few hands as possible. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s no practical way to engage with the modern internet and leave zero fingerprints on your activity. The best you can do is make it a little harder for sites and advertisers to pin you down specifically.</p>

<p>It feels like we&rsquo;ve been waiting forever for a low-priced member of Nvidia&rsquo;s new RTX 40-series GPU family. (It&rsquo;s been <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">about six months</a>, but who&rsquo;s counting?) Six hundred bucks is debatable in terms of &ldquo;low-priced,&rdquo; but the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1781139/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-review.html">GeForce RTX 4070</a> has the cheapest retail price of any of the company&rsquo;s recent offerings, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1781139/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">it&rsquo;s a great card for 1080p or 1440p gaming</a>. The GPU launches this morning, and it might be hard to find even with multiple manufacturers and the usual retail suspects lined up to deliver it. </p>



<p>We&rsquo;ve scoured the web for direct purchase links to the RTX 4070, presented below by retailer. Note that, even though Nvidia is targeting $600 for its self-branded &ldquo;Founder&rsquo;s Edition,&rdquo; a <a href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fnvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-12gb-gddr6x-graphics-card-titanium-and-black%2F6539358.p%3FskuId%3D6539358&amp;publisher_slug=pcworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=pcworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Ffeed" rel="nofollow">Best Buy exclusive in the U.S.</a>, many manufacturers seem to be bumping that price up, by $50-100, questionably justified with their custom coolers and a little light overclocking. A surprising number of custom RTX 4070 cards look ready to hit that key $599 price point however, and there are some pretty unusual prices in play. Many overclocked (OC) variants are going for the same $599 as their non-OC counterparts, while some stores have the exact same RTX 4070 model on sale for much less than rival retailers. Peruse the following list carefully!</p>



<p>New graphics cards typically release at 9 a.m. Eastern / 6 a.m. Pacific time, but that&rsquo;s not a hard and fast rule depending on the retailer. We&rsquo;ll be updating this list throughout the day as retailers post new pages for RTX 4070 cards. </p>
