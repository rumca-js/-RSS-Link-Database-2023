Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Dr. Brian Keating discuss long-held theories of cosmology, from the big bang to the expansion of the universe, and why we might be totally wrong.

Dr. Brian Keating is a cosmologist, inventor, author, academic, and podcast host. He focuses on the exploration of the big bang, prodding current theories, and building arrays to test them. He has published two bestselling books: “Losing the Nobel Prize” in 2018 and “Think Like a Nobel Prize Winner” in 2021. Keating is the inventor of the BICEP and BICEP2 Array, which are used to study the inception of the universe, and he holds multiple patents for components found within these systems. Keating also hosts the podcast “Into the Impossible,” which boasts Nobel Prize winning guests, renowned scientists from across fields, and a continuous top ten spot in the science category.
