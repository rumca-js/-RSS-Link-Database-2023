<p>Amazon is joining the generative AI fray. Bedrock is the company’s new API for Amazon Web Services (AWS) that lets developers use and customize AI tools that generate text or images. Think of it as a cloud-based and configurable alternative to OpenAI’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chatgpt-is-suddenly-everywhere-are-we-ready-180031821.html">ChatGPT</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/open-a-is-dall-e-2-produces-fantastical-images-of-most-anything-you-can-imagine-170056814.html">DALL-E 2</a> aimed at businesses and developers.</p><p>AWS customers can use Bedrock to write, build chatbots, summarize text, classify images and more based on text prompts. It gives its users a choice of Amazon’s Titan foundation model (FM) and several startups’ models, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/anthropics-claude-ai-is-guided-by-10-secret-foundational-pillars-of-fairness-193058471.html">Anthropic’s Claude</a> (a Google-backed ChatGPT rival from former OpenAI employees), AI21’s Jurassic-2 (a language model specializing in Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Italian and Dutch) and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/stable-diffusion-version-2-update-artist-styles-nsfw-work-124513511.html">Stable Diffusion</a> (a popular open-source image generator). Additionally, businesses and developers can customize how the models work based on input — which Amazon says won’t be used for training the models, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/13/aws-launches-bedrock-generative-ai-service-titan-llms.html">according to</a><em>CNBC</em>. That should (theoretically) address a crucial privacy concern for businesses entering sensitive data.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Amazon views the range of AI models on offer as a way of providing flexibility to customers. The company’s description reads, “With Bedrock’s serverless experience, you can get started quickly, privately customize FMs with your own data, and easily integrate and deploy them into your applications using the AWS tools and capabilities you are familiar with (including integrations with Amazon SageMaker ML features like Experiments to test different models and Pipelines to manage your FMs at scale) without having to manage any infrastructure.”</p><p>“Most companies want to use these large language models, but the really good ones take billions of dollars to train and many years and most companies don’t want to go through that,” Amazon CEO Andy Jassy <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2023/04/13/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-on-message-to-investors-new-ai-tools-and-stock-price.html">told</a><em>CNBC</em> on Thursday. “So what they want to do is they want to work off of a foundational model that’s big and great already and then have the ability to customize it for their own purposes. And that’s what Bedrock is.”</p><p>Amazon says C3.ai, Pegasystems, Accenture and Deloitte are some early businesses lined up to try Bedrock. The company hasn’t yet announced pricing for the AWS toolset, and it’s currently opening access through a waitlist.

## Twitter replaces 'Super Follows' with 'Subscriptions'

<p>Twitter creators who want to make money on the platform will now turn to Subscriptions, not Super Follows, in <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1646560815003373568"><ins>a rebrand</ins></a> announced by Elon Musk. Twitter originally introduced Super Follows<a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-launches-super-follow-subscriptions-180050731.html"><ins> in 2021</ins></a> as a way for creators to charge for exclusive tweets. Now, subscriptions also include long-form content (thanks to those <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-blue-4000-characters-tweets-205319437.html"><ins>extra-long</ins></a> tweets) as well as “hours long videos,” according to Musk.</p><p>But the details of the program seem to be largely unchanged from Super Follows. Creators can charge $2.00, $4.99 or $9.99 a month, with exclusive content including subscriber-only chats in Twitter Spaces, as well as special badges for paid subscribers. Interestingly, as <em>The Verge</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/13/23682184/twitter-super-follows-subscriptions-rebranding"><ins>points out</ins></a>, a <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/subscriptions-creator"><ins>help page</ins></a> says that “we hope to include newsletters and other Twitter features as potential bonus content.” That’s notable given Musk’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-stops-throttling-tweets-with-substack-links-171858782.html"><ins>recent feud</ins></a> with Substack as well as because he <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-shutting-down-revue-171029741.html"><ins>shut down</ins></a> Revue, the newsletter platform Twitter acquired in 2021, soon after taking over as CEO.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="a7b63aa4e71a42899b7b05113315c455"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">For the next 12 months, Twitter will keep none of the money. <br /><br />You will receive whatever money we receive, so that’s 70% for subscriptions on iOS &amp; Android (they charge 30%) and ~92% on web (could be better, depending on payment processor).<br /><br />After first year, iOS &amp; Android fees…</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1646564065853194241?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 13, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p></p><p>Super Follows never seemed to gain much traction, even before Musk took over Twitter. Now, it seems he’s trying to lure creators with more favorable terms, at least initially. He said that Twitter would not be taking an additional cut of creators’ earnings from Subscriptions “for the next 12 months.” Instead, creators can expect 70 percent of their earnings from mobile and about 92 percent from web-based subscriptions, which should account for all revenue after app store and payment processing fees. “We will also help promote your work,” Musk said, though he didn’t elaborate on what that would entail.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/twitter-replaces-super-follows-with-subscriptions-203711756.html?src=rss

## 'Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League' is delayed until February 2nd, 2024

<p>It'll be quite a while before you can help take out the Justice League. As <a href="https://www.engadget.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-reportedly-delayed-yet-again-202326415.html">recent reports suggested</a>, Warner Bros. Games and Rocksteady Studios have delayed <em>Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League</em> once again following a brutal reaction to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/humanity-was-the-most-interesting-game-at-sonys-state-of-play-and-you-can-play-a-demo-today-215456616.html">a showcase</a> of the game. Rather than arriving on May 26th, the title now has a release date of February 2nd, 2024. That's yet another delay after Warner Bros. Games pushed back the game from an initial 2022 release window to sometime this spring.</p><p>&quot;We have made the tough but necessary decision to take the time needed to work on getting the game to be the best quality experience for players,&quot; <a href="https://twitter.com/suicidesquadRS/status/1646593761022038017">a statement</a> on the <em>Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League</em> Twitter account reads. &quot;Thank you to our amazing community for the continued support, patience and understanding. There is much more to share in the months ahead and we look forward to seeing you in Metropolis next year.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="aa8daee57f854e31bb36ba44434603f0"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="zxx"><a href="https://t.co/iycWye9X42">pic.twitter.com/iycWye9X42</a></p>— Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League (@suicidesquadRS) <a href="https://twitter.com/suicidesquadRS/status/1646593761022038017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 13, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>We got our most in-depth look at the game to date during a PlayStation State of Play in February, but it's fair to say that fans gave the deep dive a poor reception. The live service elements that Rocksteady showed off were the focus of the criticism, with many folks reacting negatively to the always-online requirement (something Arcane is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/redfall-developer-working-to-u-turn-on-single-player-always-online-restriction">working to nix</a> from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/redfall/"><em>Redfall's</em></a> single-player mode), as well as gating cosmetic items behind microtransactions and a battle pass system.</p><p>However, Rocksteady is reportedly using the extra time to polish the game rather than overhaul its live service aspects. The studio will be focusing on ironing out bugs and improving elements it feels aren't quite up to scratch, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>.</p><p>Whatever Rocksteady feels as though it needs more time to work on, announcing a delay of eight months only six weeks or so before the game was supposed to drop isn't a great look. That said, WB has the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-is-already-the-best-selling-game-of-2023-in-the-us/1100-6512789/">biggest-selling title of the year</a> so far under its belt, which perhaps gives it a bit more flexibility to scuttle off <em>Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League</em> into early 2024. When it does eventually arrive, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rocksteady-suicide-squad-game-005154513.html">co-op action-adventure game</a> will be available on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-is-delayed-until-february-2nd-2024-201547147.html?src=rss

## Meta has open-sourced an AI project that turns your doodles into animations

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/meta/"><ins>Meta</ins></a> has <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2023/04/13/meta-os-animated-drawings/"><ins>open-sourced</ins></a> an artificial intelligence project that lets anyone bring their doodles to life. The company hopes that by offering Animated Drawings as an open-source project other developers will be able to create new, richer experiences.</p><p>The Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) team originally released a <a href="https://sketch.metademolab.com/">web-based version of the tool</a> in 2021. It asks users to upload a drawing of a single human-like character or to select a demo figure. If you use your own doodle, you'll see a consent form that asks if Meta can use your drawing to help train its models. You don't need to provide consent to keep using the tool.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Next, you'll need to resize a capture box so it fits snugly around your creation. The tool gives you a pen and eraser to tweak the drawing before adjusting where the joints should be. After all that, you'll see an animated version of your sketch. You can pick from a variety of preset animations from four categories: dance, funny, jumping and walking.</p><div id="74fba42c20f246fa8a687b77c8ecdd0f"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>Animated Drawings harnesses object detection models, pose estimation models and image processing-based segmentation methods to capture a digital version of a drawing. It then uses traditional computer graphics techniques to deform and animate the image.</p><p>Within a few months of <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/12/using-ai-to-animate-childrens-drawings/"><ins>the demo going live</ins></a>, users had granted Meta permission to use more than 1.6 million images for training purposes. Some folks uploaded images of company logos, anime characters, fish and stuffed animals, despite the tool stipulating that only human figures would work.</p><p>Along with requests for a more in-depth toolset that includes sound effects and text overlays, the array of images that people uploaded to the tool suggested there was broad interest in more extensive drawing-to-animation experiences. That, in part, led to Meta open sourcing the project with a dataset of around 180,000 drawings. &quot;By releasing the models and code as open source, the project provides a starting point for developers to build on and extend the project, fostering a culture of innovation and collaboration within the open source community,&quot; Meta wrote in a blog post.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/meta-has-open-sourced-an-ai-project-that-turns-your-doodles-into-animations-183807106.html?src=rss

<p><em>Desta: The Memories Between</em> is officially coming to the Nintendo Switch and PC on April 26th. If you haven’t gotten a chance to play the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ustwo-new-game-desta-reveal-203322151.html"><ins>well-regarded roguelike</ins></a>, it's likely because it was previously tied to Netflix as an exclusive title for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ustwo-desta-netflix-game-173008612.html"><ins>burgeoning gaming platform</ins></a>.</p><p><em>Desta</em> was developed by the company ustwo, which also created the mega-popular mobile title <em>Monument Valley</em> and its sequel. Beyond some slight graphical similarities, however, <em>Desta</em> is its own beast. The title combines a roguelike gameplay style with turn-based mechanics, with plenty of quirky surprises. The story involves a twentysomething returning home after their dad’s death. You help neighbors deal with pressing issues by solving puzzles and, well, playing a whole lot of dodgeball. The dodgeball challenges change from run to run, which is why this title is sometimes compared to games like <em>Hades</em> and <em>Into the Breach.</em></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="ea35d0cd90b9460391a92e6b573cdcf6"></div><p>This is the <em>Dream Team Edition</em> of <em>Desta: The Memories Between</em>, so it includes every content update that came down the pike since the original launch last year. This includes new story scenarios, updated abilities and a range of difficulty settings. You can also play as three new characters, including Alba from <em>Alba: A Wild Adventure, </em>another ustwo title<em>.</em></p><p>Purchasing this game for Switch or PC also nets you a digital soundtrack and a 52-page digital artbook. Both the art style and the music are singled-out as positives in reviews, so these perks are likely to draw in pre-existing players. It costs around $20 to pick up on the Nintendo eShop or the Steam Store.&nbsp;</p><p>“We’ve packed this bundle with so many new abilities, characters, game modes and more – I can’t wait for our community to get their hands on it,” wrote Lead Designer Joel Beardshaw in a press release when the <a href="https://www.mynewsdesk.com/uk/bastion-uk/pressreleases/desta-the-memories-between-dream-team-edition-by-ustwo-games-is-coming-to-pc-and-switch-this-april-3230755"><ins>port was officially announced in January.</ins></a></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/desta-the-memories-between-comes-to-switch-and-pc-later-this-month-175037612.html?src=rss

You play a new battlemage who's thrust into a never-ending war for control of the world's magic.</p><p>This isn't Call of Duty with spells, though, or even a revival of classic fantasy shooters like <em>Heretic</em>. <em>Immortals</em> revolves around a combination system that rewards mixing up different magic types to defeat enemies. You can also draw on magical abilities to create shields or turn the environment against your foes. Ascendant is also promising a narrative-focused experience with an extensive backstory, not to mention recognizable voices like Darren Barnet (<em>Never Have I Ever</em>) and Gina Torres (<em>Firefly</em>).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="a8e9e8d3211441f0bf4893817901bd65"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>Ascendant is part of a wave of indie studios formed by departing leaders at major game developers. It's helmed by Bret Robbins, the creative director from the original <em>Dead Space</em>, who formed Ascendant in 2018 with <em>Immortals</em> in mind. The team also includes <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-21-telltale-games-layoffs-the-walking-dead.html">former Telltale Games workers</a> as well as people behind well-known games like <em>Spider-Man</em> and <em>Tomb Raider</em>.

## Researchers used machine learning to improve the first photo of a black hole

<p>Researchers have used machine learning to tighten up a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-10-first-image-of-black-hole.html">previously released image</a> of a black hole. As a result, the portrait of the black hole at the center of the galaxy Messier 87, over 53 million light years away from Earth, shows a thinner ring of light and matter surrounding its center in a <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/acc32d#apjlacc32df1">report published today</a> in <em>The Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>.</p><p>The original images were captured in 2017 by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), a network of radio telescopes around Earth that combine to act as a planet-sized super-imaging tool. The initial picture looked like a “fuzzy donut,” as <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/04/13/1169469591/goodbye-fuzzy-donut-the-famous-first-black-hole-photo-gets-sharpened-up">described</a> by <em>NPR</em>, but researchers used a new method called PRIMO to reconstruct a more accurate image. PRIMO is “a novel dictionary-learning-based algorithm” that learns to “recover high-fidelity images even in the presence of sparse coverage” by training on generated simulations of over 30,000 black holes. In other words, it uses machine learning data based on what we know about the universe’s physical laws — and black holes specifically — to produce a better-looking and more accurate shot from the raw data captured in 2017.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Black holes are mysterious and strange regions of space where gravity is so strong that nothing can escape. They form when dying stars collapse onto themselves under their gravity. As a result, the collapse squeezes the star’s mass into a tiny space. The boundary between the black hole and its surrounding mass is called the event horizon, a point of no return where anything that crosses it (whether light, matter or Matthew McConaughey) won’t be coming back.</p><p>“What we really do is we learn the correlations between different parts of the image. And so we do this by analyzing tens of thousands of high-resolution images that are created from simulations,” the astrophysicist and author of the paper Lia Medeiros of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, NJ, told <em>NPR</em>. “If you have an image, the pixels close to any given pixel are not completely uncorrelated. It’s not that each pixel is doing completely independent things.”</p><p>The researchers say the new image is consistent with Albert Einstein’s predictions. However, they expect further research in machine learning and telescope hardware to lead to additional revisions. “In 20 years, the image might not be the image I’m showing you today,” said Medeiros. “It might be even better.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/researchers-used-machine-learning-to-improve-the-first-photo-of-a-black-hole-170722614.html?src=rss

The biggest chunk of revenue, 31 percent, comes from donations from individuals. NPR, meanwhile, says federal funding makes up less than one percent of its average annual budget.

Lee reportedly knew Momeni and was a passenger in a car belonging to the suspect, the insiders say. A confrontation supposedly erupted in the car, and may have continued after Lee stepped out.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We've asked the San Francisco Police Department for comment.

He was also an investor in tech startups and helped develop the World Health Organization's mobile app during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>If accurate, the report would explain why Lee was killed in a section of San Francisco that rarely sees pedestrian traffic in the early morning. It would also make the death a historical rarity.

<p>Turning a radio show or any other live broadcast into a podcast isn't quite as simple as uploading the exact same file somewhere else. Downloading an episode from a radio platform, yanking ads, dropping in ad markers, making other edits and uploading it as a podcast typically takes up to an hour, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/spotify/"><ins>Spotify</ins></a> said. To take some of the sting out of that process, the company has released a tool that can automatically create podcast episodes from existing broadcasts.</p><p>Spotify is using tech from Whooshkaa, a company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-acquires-whooshkaa-podcast-platform-211237552.html"><ins>it bought in 2021</ins></a>, to power the tool. Users of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-megaphone-ad-tech-in-third-party-podcasts-145805535.html"><ins>Megaphone</ins></a>, Spotify's podcasting platform for businesses, will have access to it. Several publishers are already using Megaphone to convert radio broadcasts into podcasts, including Fox News Audio. The tech can identify existing ad marker locations, and publishers can replace or reposition them before the podcast episode goes live.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to data from Pew Research that Spotify cited <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-04-13/spotifys-new-publishing-tool-makes-it-easy-to-turn-broadcasts-into-podcasts/"><ins>in its announcement</ins></a>, Gen Z folks prefer to get news through digital mediums, such as podcasts. As such, radio publishers could use this kind of tech to reach new audiences without adding too much more to their workload. Spotify says more than half of Gen Z and millennials in the US use the platform, while it has more than 500 million users globally.</p><p>For consumers, the tool will likely bring an even wider selection of podcasts to Spotify. It could give YouTubers and Twitch streamers who host live podcasts an easy way to make their discussions available on Spotify too.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/spotifys-latest-publishing-tool-can-swiftly-turn-broadcasts-into-podcasts-153853714.html?src=rss

## How to choose the best pizza oven in 2023
 - [https://www.engadget.com/best-pizza-oven-141550352.html?src=rss](https://www.engadget.com/best-pizza-oven-141550352.html?src=rss)

<p>Small outdoor pizza ovens have become popular <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-fall-outdoor-tech-gear-150041103.html">backyard</a> cooking options in recent years. While anyone with a decent-sized patio could have a permanent one installed, these versatile products are more compact and store easily in a bag when you’re not using them. That makes them great for people who have limited outdoor space and allows you to take them on the road as needed. There are also great options for having a dedicated pizza oven indoors. Here are a few specs you’ll want to consider before making a purchase, plus some recommendations to get you started.</p><h2>What to look for</h2><p>When shopping for an oven, you’ll first want to consider what types of pizza you plan to make. Most portable outdoor pizza ovens from the likes of Ooni, Solo Stove and others use wood and are primarily designed for the high-heat cooking required for light and airy Neapolitan-style pies. We’re talking temperatures up to 900 degrees Fahrenheit. These units can certainly cook different styles at cooler temperatures, but they’re easiest to use when you’re running them wide open with a full load of wood.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you purchase a propane or natural gas burner, you can adjust temperatures easily by turning a knob. For this reason, I recommend you spend the extra $100 or so on that accessory. It makes your pizza oven a lot more versatile and gives you the option to still have a freshly fired pie when you don’t feel like messing with wood or charcoal. If you only want to cook with gas, there are models available that only use propane or natural gas.</p><p>The other key consideration is size. Most companies make ovens that fit 12-inch pizzas, a perfect size for one person. They’re also great for parties, since people can customize their own without having to pick off toppings they don’t like. If you want to make larger pizzas or plan to use your oven for other things (pans, etc), consider a larger version that can accommodate more than just small pies. The interior dimensions – or at the very least the stone size – will be listed on most product pages.</p><figure><img alt="The best pizza ovens for 2023" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/5d227b90-d88e-11ed-abef-0e6778381ba5" style="height: 1333px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><h2>Plan for success</h2><p>Making pizza at home requires a considerable amount of counter or table space. You’ll need room to stretch and prep your dough, lay out your toppings and load pizzas onto a peel. Of course, some folks will be comfortable working in the tight confines of a small kitchen, but I’ve found it much easier to use extra space to make sure I’m not constantly moving things around during the various steps in the process.</p><p>It’s also less hassle to set up your pizza station in close proximity to your pizza oven. As a rookie baker, I did the running back and forth from the kitchen to the back porch. It’s far from ideal. It’s difficult to maintain your fire (if using wood or charcoal) when you’re unable to watch it closely. The good news is a patio table can be easily converted into a pizza station with a large cutting board. This also gets your oven off the ground so it’s easier to access.</p><p>Ooni <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=0de15002-ec35-49d8-b24c-3d060213cd2b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Ooni+Pizza+Ovens&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIwZGUxNTAwMi1lYzM1LTQ5ZDgtYjI0Yy0zZDA2MDIxM2NkMmIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9vb25pLmNvbS9jb2xsZWN0aW9ucy9tb3JlIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlNTgyZGU0Ny04NTUxLTQzODMtYmVhNy0xMTI4OWIxNDMyZTgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVpCSPYvpwI5lfnVJUfzhd1ZlHNXKWc0Kq5RmAT8AHRu&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fooni.com%2Fcollections%2Fmore">sells tables</a> for its ovens that also offer shelving and storage for peels and other accessories. Solo Stove has a <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f5421854-3d3e-46b7-ba38-db91920c7f00&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Solo+Stove&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmNTQyMTg1NC0zZDNlLTQ2YjctYmEzOC1kYjkxOTIwYzdmMDAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9zb2xvc3RvdmUuY29tL2VuLXVzL3AvcGktc3RhbmQiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImU1ODJkZTQ3LTg1NTEtNDM4My1iZWE3LTExMjg5YjE0MzJlOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAUKHwEUykJvcI06_XD6oAcpNoanJJR--93u-mD8kpP85&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsolostove.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fpi-stand">rolling stand</a> for its Pi oven too, with small side shelves and a spot for your propane tank underneath. Of course, you can find other tables and stands to suit your needs, just make sure they can withstand any heat that may radiate from the bottom of the oven while cooking. Most ovens are either well insulated or don’t project too much excess heat toward the table, but you can never be too careful. For that reason, a stainless steel or metal surface is a good choice to set up an outdoor model.</p><p>Most of these pizza ovens cook quickly at high heat, especially if you’re making Neapolitan-style pies. Having everything you need nearby so you can keep tabs on the oven and quickly make the next pizza will ease a lot of unnecessary headaches. When your cook time is two minutes or less, you don’t want to venture too far.</p><h2>Outdoor pizza ovens</h2><h3>A good multi-fuel outdoor pizza oven: Ooni Karu 16</h3><p></p><p>If you’re looking to go all-in on an outdoor pizza oven, you can’t go wrong with <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Pb25pLUthcnUtTXVsdGktRnVlbC1PdXRkb29yLVBpenphL2RwL0IwOTVDSjVLU0QvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXNwLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlNTgyZGU0Ny04NTUxLTQzODMtYmVhNy0xMTI4OWIxNDMyZTgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAdlmvMi7k25EJJDjFNPU2W_bx6VJqdXqxG1Z6YBHWKI6&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FOoni-Karu-Multi-Fuel-Outdoor-Pizza%2Fdp%2FB095CJ5KSD%2F">Ooni’s Karu 16</a>. It’s the company’s largest multi-fuel model, which means you can choose between wood, charcoal or gas (propane and natural gas burners sold separately). This one is equipped with a hinged glass door for keeping tabs on your progress and a digital thermometer monitors the ambient temperature inside. The larger size means you can not only cook bigger pizzas, but the Karu 16 can also accommodate pans and cast iron, so baking, roasting and searing are all possible here. It’s this versatility that makes the Karu 16 our top pick.</p><h3>A solid outdoor pizza oven: Solo Stove Pi</h3><p></p><p>Solo Stove may be on your radar for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/solo-stoves-fire-pit-20-removable-base-plate-ash-pan-cleanup-143100211.html">its fire pits</a>, but the company also makes a <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Tb2xvLVN0b3ZlLUFzc2VtYmx5LUNvcmRpZXJpdGUtU3RhaW5sZXNzL2RwL0IwQjdYWFhDWkcvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXNwLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlNTgyZGU0Ny04NTUxLTQzODMtYmVhNy0xMTI4OWIxNDMyZTgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARw-Do09kGbwfRdiZRKlaXkKuq5J7mbqweiatd-dPp5f&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSolo-Stove-Assembly-Cordierite-Stainless%2Fdp%2FB0B7XXXCZG%2F">solid pizza oven</a>. Dubbed the Pi, this unit is made out of stainless steel and is round like the company’s trademark products. Solo Stove says Pi can hit temperatures of 850 degrees Fahrenheit with wood and 900 degrees with a gas burner (sold separately). It explains that those figures translate to maximum stone temps of 750 and 800 degrees respectively. The Pi’s big difference from the Karu 16 and other Ooni ovens is that it doesn’t have a front door and stays open the whole time like a brick oven.</p><h3>A great smaller option: Ooni Fyra 12</h3><p></p><p>The <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Pb25pLUZ5cmEtT3V0ZG9vci1Qb3J0YWJsZS1LaXRjaGVuL2RwL0IwODgzODVOOVovP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXNwLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlNTgyZGU0Ny04NTUxLTQzODMtYmVhNy0xMTI4OWIxNDMyZTgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAASFRLfAzMLiznhxBXI5Wuh0iHp4OF_3dwFo9cR_xUWyZ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FOoni-Fyra-Outdoor-Portable-Kitchen%2Fdp%2FB088385N9Z%2F">Ooni Fyra 12</a> was the first outdoor pizza oven I used and it remains one of my favorites. It’s compact compared to some of the alternatives (22 pounds), so it won’t take up quite as much storage space. It also runs on wood pellets instead of chunks, and once you get the fire going, you just refill the chute from the top. This means there’s much less tending a fire on the Fyra than other wood-burning models, so you can focus on making and cooking your pizzas. The Fyra does all the things other Ooni pizza ovens do well, including high-heat bakes (950 degrees) in as little as a minute.</p><h2>Indoor pizza ovens</h2><p>Let me preface this section by saying you probably already have an indoor option that you can use to make some great pizza. Whether that’s the main oven in your kitchen or a multi-function countertop unit, with some affordable accessories, you can easily up your game without spending $1,000 on a dedicated appliance. For example, my <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9CcmV2aWxsZS1CT1Y4NjBCU1MtQ291bnRlcnRvcC1Db252ZWN0aW9uLVN0YWlubGVzcy9kcC9CMDg1RlRCTEM2P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXNwLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlNTgyZGU0Ny04NTUxLTQzODMtYmVhNy0xMTI4OWIxNDMyZTgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVcylFxGokn8E7kN4RYhg0kXpXkUgvfVEyVbjXsQ9LQt&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBreville-BOV860BSS-Countertop-Convection-Stainless%2Fdp%2FB085FTBLC6">Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer</a> has a convection pizza setting that automatically adjusts cook time based on the size, temperature and whether the pie is fresh or frozen. A key consideration here is size. These things are massive, about the size of a large microwave, so you likely won’t want to keep them out all the time unless you have a huge kitchen.</p><h3>A versatile indoor pizza oven: Ooni Volt 12</h3><p></p><p>Ooni made its name on outdoor pizza ovens that primarily burn wood or run on gas. For 2023, the company is taking things indoors with the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=0de15002-ec35-49d8-b24c-3d060213cd2b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Ooni+Pizza+Ovens&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIwZGUxNTAwMi1lYzM1LTQ5ZDgtYjI0Yy0zZDA2MDIxM2NkMmIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9vb25pLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0cy9vb25pLXZvbHQiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImU1ODJkZTQ3LTg1NTEtNDM4My1iZWE3LTExMjg5YjE0MzJlOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAbs6K5UOSm8E-W_bMajznrC6hE6gSrwegRQG3GoG3gqs&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fooni.com%2Fproducts%2Fooni-volt">Volt 12</a>. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oonis-volt-12-is-the-companys-first-indoor-pizza-oven-173011466.html">Ooni’s first electric oven</a> can also be used outside thanks to weather resistant construction, but this behemoth brings the company’s design and efficiency to your kitchen for the first time. Capable of temperatures up to 850 degrees Fahrenheit in as little as 20 minutes, the Volt 12 can fire up Neapolitan style pies in 90 seconds. Controls on the front give you the ability to adjust both the top and bottom heating elements. There are also cooking presets and a Boost function to quickly get the stone back to temp between pizzas. The 13-inch stone inside is square, so you can slide in pans for Detroit recipes or other baked goods.</p><h3>A solid indoor pizza oven: Breville Pizzaiolo</h3><p></p><p>If you’re set on buying a dedicated pizza oven, the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9CcmV2aWxsZS1QaXp6YWlvbG8tQlBaODIwQlNTLUJydXNoZWQtU3RhaW5sZXNzL2RwL0IwOFI4WVpSMzI_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tc3AtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImU1ODJkZTQ3LTg1NTEtNDM4My1iZWE3LTExMjg5YjE0MzJlOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAZpOAEufnbwWCGDzjVUYurIRPrRyq2rE2abyRwwaeYbL&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBreville-Pizzaiolo-BPZ820BSS-Brushed-Stainless%2Fdp%2FB08R8YZR32">Breville Pizzaiolo</a> is another great option, but it’s just as pricey as the Volt 12. The Pizzaiolo cooks 12-inch pies as well, but the stone on this unit is perfectly sized for them and there’s a metal heat reflector panel inside that will also keep you from overshooting the cooking surface. This means you won’t be sliding larger rectangle pans in here like you can with the electric Ooni. Round pans fit just fine and some smaller square ones likely will too.</p><p>In terms of cooking ability, Breville offers presets for “Wood Fired,” New York, Pan, Thin &amp; Crispy and Frozen pizzas with the added option to run the oven full blast at 750 degrees Fahrenheit. A second dial allows you to adjust the top heating element depending on how dark you want your pizza. Like it does on other Breville appliances, Element IQ tech adjusts the heating elements based on the selected style, creating the ideal environment for each one. For advanced users, the company offers a manual mode that turns the timer dial into a control for the bottom deck while the style preset selector manages the top. Breville includes a magnetic overlay for the front panel to show you temperatures for the converted controls. The instruction manual also gives you recommendations for where to begin with manual mode for the aforementioned styles.</p><h3>The best pizza accessories for the oven you already have</h3><p>If you want to make good pizza at home without spending hundreds of dollars on a dedicated oven, you can definitely do it with the oven you already have in your kitchen. With a few accessories, you can improve your game without splurging on a Breville, Ooni or Solo Stove. First, I’d recommend a high quality baking steel or stone.</p><p><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9PbGQtU3RvbmUtT3Zlbi1SZWN0YW5ndWxhci1QaXp6YS9kcC9CMDAwMEUxRkRBP3JlZl89YXN0X3N0b19kcCZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1zcC0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZTU4MmRlNDctODU1MS00MzgzLWJlYTctMTEyODliMTQzMmU4In0&amp;signature=AQAAAYhn2BEXBjIlUhVUE-gcCDCKkKEbWS800nVc0GwssboU&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FOld-Stone-Oven-Rectangular-Pizza%2Fdp%2FB0000E1FDA%3Fref_%3Dast_sto_dp">Baking stones</a> are great for getting better browning on the bottom of your pies than a pizza or sheet pan. You can also use them for bread, cookies and other items. The stone absorbs heat to cook pizza quickly, like the inside of a brick oven, which leads to a crisp crust. They’re also more affordable compared to <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9CYWtpbmctU3RlZWwtT3JpZ2luYWwtVWx0cmEtQ29uZHVjdGl2ZS9kcC9CMDBOMjA1RzIyP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXNwLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlNTgyZGU0Ny04NTUxLTQzODMtYmVhNy0xMTI4OWIxNDMyZTgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAeEbDEKojEDMsFXyWihRBYfzEgwmrp2Q1uKdD4J5W_F7&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBaking-Steel-Original-Ultra-Conductive%2Fdp%2FB00N205G22%3F">baking steels</a>. Those metal slabs do have one key advantage: higher heat conductivity. This means a steel will cook your pizzas faster since it can absorb more heat from your oven. While baking steels can be used as griddles on your stovetop and for other types of baking, they’re not ideal for some leavened breads.</p><p>The second item you’ll want is a <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9OZXctU3Rhci1Gb29kc2VydmljZS01MDI5NS1Xb29kZW4vZHAvQjAwOUxQRE5QTy8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tc3AtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImU1ODJkZTQ3LTg1NTEtNDM4My1iZWE3LTExMjg5YjE0MzJlOCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAeHLwzq7fJFIm1-ixj3_YAjMRj60G1dLxlCwHW3rnnFH&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNew-Star-Foodservice-50295-Wooden%2Fdp%2FB009LPDNPO%2F">pizza peel</a>. These come in all shapes and sizes, made out of a variety of materials. I typically use a bamboo or wooden peel when topping and launching my pizzas and then a metal one for retrieving them. I’ve found that dough doesn’t stick as easily to bamboo during prep and the metal resists the high heat of the oven when turning or retrieving a finished pizza (bamboo will burn).

A peel is a great tool for loading and turning pizzas, and since you’ll typically be cooking them with your oven at 500 degrees or hotter, using something like parchment paper to move them around won’t work.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-pizza-oven-141550352.html?src=rss

## ‘Star Trek: Picard’ turns a corner and jumps on the rollercoaster

<p><em>The following article discusses Star Trek: Picard, Season Three, Episode 9, “Võx”</em></p><p>I’ve always found accusations that I <em>hate</em> Star Trek weird, since I make my love of Trek clear enough every time I write one of these reviews. Every time I watch a nü-Trek episode that I’m fortunate enough to do as part of my day job, I hope that I can genuinely talk about it with a sense of love. And so I am delighted to say “Võx” is the best episode of <em>Star Trek: Picard</em> ever made. It is not by any means perfect, but it’s such a leap from what’s gone before I’ve almost got whiplash.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>One of the reasons that “Võx” pops is that Picard’s quality ceiling has been relentlessly low over the last three seasons. The other is that the narrative’s brakes are off, allowing events to move at something faster than a snail’s pace. If I was in a less-generous mood, I’d say a lot of this stuff could have happened earlier in the run to improve the overall pacing. One of the biggest issues I’ve had is the very visible stretching of a thin, mystery-box story over a studio-mandated ten-episode running order.</p><p>By comparison, this feels like the first free meal after two 500-calorie-only days on the 5:2 fast diet. You devour a 12-inch pizza and, since you’ve starved yourself for the last 48 hours, you feel you deserve to go out for tacos afterward. In this episode, we learn that Jack is, as Reddit clocked weeks back, the product of a union ‘twixt Dr. Crusher and Picard’s Borgified sperm. We also get a whopping retcon to the plot hole in <em>First Contact</em>, where Picard could hear the Borg and knew the location of the cube’s weak spot despite not being connected to the collective.</p><p>Jack decides to go off and tackle the Borg Queen (voiced by Alice Krige!) herself, while Geordi, Data and Beverley start examining the conspiracy. The Queen has already picked a Borgified name for Jack — Võx — to commence his Locutus-like transformation as part of the collective, too. The Borg and Changelings are working together – I’d love to see how <em>that</em> meeting went – to undermine the Federation. They’ve set up every transporter in the fleet to re-write the genetic code of the under ‘25s who pass through it, seeding them with Bio-Borg DNA. When Frontier Day happens, the collective activates its new army of drones, who also turn the newly-connected fleet into an armada.</p><p>Fleeing a Titan similarly overrun with Bio-Borgs, the TNG crew get into a shuttle while Seven and Raffi guard Shaw, who takes a phaser to the chest. He even gets a nice valediction, finally using Seven’s chosen name to put a button on his much-discussed arc. Not long after, we get the first laugh-out-loud-on-purpose moment in the series when Geordi asks Data to be more optimistic. There’s a simple, glorious pleasure in letting the endlessly-talented Brent Spiner show off his natural comedic flair in the midst of all this darkness.</p><p>The gang race back to the Fleet Museum where, again Reddit called this a month or more back, the Enterprise D has been quietly rebuilt in secret by Geordi. There’s some moments of winking at the camera as the production team head off the obvious questions. How? They pulled the saucer section from Veridian to avoid breaking the Prime Directive and cobbled together other parts from other Galaxy Class ships. Why not the E? Blame Worf, now shut up and watch with a smile plastered on your face as they sit in their old chairs. Hell, they’ve even got <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-09-06-star-treks-iconic-computer-voice-may-live-on-in-your-phone.html">Majel Barrett Roddenberry’s voice</a> for the Enterprise D computer.</p><p>We need to be careful here, because I’ve slammed this series time and again for its empty, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-picard-3-1-the-next-generation-review-140048105.html">paraphilic use of nostalgia</a>. There are plenty of reasons why this makes no logical sense if you take the time to interrogate things. Maybe it’s because the episode moves at such a clip that there’s no time to overthink things before something else happens. Maybe it’s just the thrill of seeing these actors on this bridge, on <em>this carpet</em>, that the bulk of my critical thinking has been bypassed.&nbsp;</p><p>If I have concerns, it’s still about what <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-picard-307-dominion-review-140506376.html"><em>Picard</em> is trying to <em>say</em></a>. Relegating the cyberpunk elements of the Borg to make their assimilation more biological could be seen as an anti-vaccination screed. It’s hard to watch yet another <em>TNG</em> side character brutally die – Ro in “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-picard-3-5-imposters-review-130001398.html">Imposters</a>” and Admiral Elizabeth Shelby, captain of the new Enterprise F, taking two in the chest mere moments later here. There’s an argument that leaving Seven and Raffi on the Titan also sidelines the series’ two queer characters. And this subtextual <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-picard-3-6-the-bounty-review-130030243.html">mistrust of youth</a> which was discussed a few episodes back has now been rendered very much part of Picard’s text.</p><p>But I will withhold my judgments about that until next week, when we see how those points are handled. For now, I’m going to bask in the very brief glow of my monitor, and how glorious it was when the lights on the Enterprise D bridge raised to old-school TV levels and we could actually see what was going on. The lights went up and so did the mood, and after all this time, it comes as sweet relief. Now, onward to the finale.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-picard-309-vox-review-140046969.html?src=rss

## The best gaming headsets for 2023

<p>Most of the time, the best gaming headset isn’t a “gaming headset” at all. Although these devices are often thought of as a distinct niche within the wider headphone market, they're ultimately <em>still headphones</em>. And while it’s certainly not impossible to get a gaming headset that sounds nice, doing so still tends to come at a higher cost than a comparable pair of wired headphones (yes, those still exist).</p><p>A good wired headphone remains your best bet if you want the most detailed sound possible at a given price point and don’t need something especially portable, which is usually the case when you’re gaming. If you need to chat with friends, you can always buy an external microphone, whether it’s a USB mic, a cheaper <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-mobile-microphones-for-recording-with-a-phone-154536629.html">clip-on mic</a> or a standalone headset mic like the <a href="https://antlionaudio.com/collections/microphones/">Antlion ModMic</a> or <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9WLU1PREEtQm9vbVByby1NaWNyb3Bob25lLUdhbWluZy1Db21tdW5pY2F0aW9uL2RwL0IwMEJKMTdXS0svP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXNtLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhNmZhNjdhNy03NmE4LTRlZjEtOWM4ZC01OWM0NjNjYjNhZGIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAc3eyz3tAa5ZiXqoOSXXUJbQ9_Y1rClL-8LF-6d_J8BW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FV-MODA-BoomPro-Microphone-Gaming-Communication%2Fdp%2FB00BJ17WKK%2F">V-Moda BoomPro</a>. In many cases, those will make your voice sound clearer and fuller than the ones included with a gaming headset.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But we do recognize that many people just want the convenience of an all-in-one combo, value and aesthetics be damned. So after testing out a few dozen pairs over the past several months, we’ve put together a list of good headphones for gaming and dedicated gaming headsets. We recommend you consider the former first, but all of them should make your play time more enjoyable.</p><h2>What to look for in good gaming headphones</h2><figure><img alt="A black gaming headset with a built-in boom microphone, the HyperX Cloud Stinger 2, rests on a white table in an outdoors setting." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/7a99ecc0-d95c-11ed-b13c-943d83f982b8" style="height: 1200px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><p>Evaluating headphones is a particularly subjective exercise, so calling one pair the absolute “best” is something of a fool’s errand. At a certain point, everything becomes a matter of taste. For most, a headphone with a wide soundstage and strong imaging performance – i.e., the ability to position sounds correctly, so you can more precisely tell where footsteps and other game effects are coming from – will provide the most immersive experience, the kind that makes you feel like your head is <em>within</em> a given scene.</p><p>For that, you want a headphone with an open-back design. That is to say, an over-ear pair whose earcups do not completely seal off the ear from air and outside noise. The big trade-off is that these are inherently terrible at isolating you from external sound and preventing others from hearing what you’re playing. So if you often play games in a noisy environment, their benefits will be blunted. But in a quiet room, the best open-back pairs sounds significantly wider and more precise than more common closed-back models.</p><p>More up for debate is <em>how</em> a good gaming headphone should sound. If you want something that’ll help you in competitive multiplayer games, you'll likely prefer a headphone with a flatter sound signature, so a game’s mix won’t be overly boosted in one direction and mask the smaller details of what’s happening around you. A slightly brighter sound, one that pushes the upper frequencies a smidge, may also work. Open-back headphones almost never have huge sub-bass, so you rarely have to worry about low-end sounds muddying up the rest of the signature. In this light, the fact that an overwhelming amount of gaming headsets are closed-back and bass-heavy seems counterintuitive.</p><p>Lots of people love bass, though. And if you aren’t just worried about competitive play, some extra low-end can add a touch of excitement to heavy action scenes or a rousing soundtrack. You still don’t want a pair that boosts it too hard – which many dedicated gaming headsets do – but the point is that what makes a pair “immersive” to one person may sound dull to another.</p><h2>Best headphones for gaming: Beyerdynamic DT 900 Pro X</h2><p></p><p>The <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOUc3NzdWRzcvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXNtLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhNmZhNjdhNy03NmE4LTRlZjEtOWM4ZC01OWM0NjNjYjNhZGIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAftHZ3ObpyTnCGlnlk1QTt5XdsUA6Chr2_wDQQY2PZNc&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB09G777VG7%2F">Beyerdynamic DT 900 Pro X</a> should please a wide swath of people willing to pay for a capital-N <em>nice</em> set of headphones for gaming. This pair has great imaging performance and the kind of spacious soundstage expected from an open-back design. Bass is a little more present here than on many open-back headphones as well. There still isn’t much in the way of deep sub-bass, as expected, but there’s enough warmth to give in-game explosions a bit more juice without muddying up the mid-range frequencies. The mids get the most emphasis overall, but they’re clear and that forwardness isn’t a bad thing when you’re trying to listen for enemy players in a competitive FPS like <em>Counter-Strike</em>. The treble isn’t pushed quite as hard, but it’s neither overly recessed nor harsh.</p><p>All of this means the DT 900 Pro X sounds detailed but not boring, so it should play nice whether you’re trying to win a multiplayer game or taking in a more cinematic single-player experience. And when you’re not gaming, you get an enjoyable sound for music.</p><p>Everything’s built well, too. It’ll clamp down slightly harder than average if you have a large head, but it balances its weight well, and its wonderfully soft velour earpads go a long way toward keeping the pair comfortable over long sessions. It comes with two detachable cables, including a three-meter option that’s convenient if you sit far from your PC. This design can’t fold up, though.</p><p>Like all open-back headphones, the DT 900 Pro X leak and let in lots of noise, so it’s not great on the go. Clearly, if you can afford an ultra-premium pair like <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zZW5uaGVpc2VyLWhlYXJpbmcuY29tL2VuLVVTL3AvaGQtODAwLXMvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhNmZhNjdhNy03NmE4LTRlZjEtOWM4ZC01OWM0NjNjYjNhZGIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAa6x7Onjo7WKOjzbCSxIVnseZmZkmCiglwJ606VhetVN&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sennheiser-hearing.com%2Fen-US%2Fp%2Fhd-800-s%2F">Sennheiser’s HD 800 S</a>, you’ll get more space and true-to-life detail. But for a relatively attainable $250 to $300, the DT 900 Pro X should satisfy.</p><h2>Best headphones for gaming under $200: Sennheiser HD 560S</h2><p></p><p>If you’d rather not spend as much, the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOEo5TVZCNlcvcmVmPW94X3NjX2FjdF90aXRsZV8xP3NtaWQ9QVRWUERLSUtYMERFUiZwc2M9MSZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1zbS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYTZmYTY3YTctNzZhOC00ZWYxLTljOGQtNTljNDYzY2IzYWRiIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAWDyYK2qqowd_jCmxamL_U0xsNiUmfFzxSo8Rr1ule3g&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB08J9MVB6W%2Fref%3Dox_sc_act_title_1%3Fsmid%3DATVPDKIKX0DER%26psc%3D1">Sennheiser HD 560S</a> is another excellent open-back headphone that’s typically available for around $150. Like the DT 900 Pro X, it has a wide soundstage that’ll help you feel immersed in a given game. Its sound is slightly more neutral on the whole, so you won’t feel like you’re missing any part of a mix, and it retrieves a lovely amount of detail from the treble and mid-range frequencies. There's less bass power for explosions, though, and the treble, while more present, may sound piercing at times. Imaging isn’t <em>quite</em> as nuanced either, though it’s nowhere near poor.</p><p>Design-wise, the HD 560S are plenty comfortable to wear for extended periods. They don’t clamp down too hard on those with big heads (like yours truly), and the velour earpads hug your ears softly. The included cable is removable, too. The plastic frame doesn’t feel as sturdy or premium as the DT 900 Pro X, however, so you won’t want to chuck them around haphazardly. It won’t block much outside noise either, nor will it prevent those around you from hearing what you're playing. Nevertheless, the HD 560S is a pleasure and a great value.</p><h2>Best headphones for gaming under $50: Koss KSC75</h2><p></p><p>If you can’t spend more than $50, it’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/koss-ksc75-headphones-irl-143533671.html">still hard</a> to top the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Lb3NzLUtTQzc1LVBvcnRhYmxlLVN0ZXJlb3Bob25lLUhlYWRwaG9uZXMvZHAvQjAwMDZCNDg2Sz90aD0xJnRhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXNtLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhNmZhNjdhNy03NmE4LTRlZjEtOWM4ZC01OWM0NjNjYjNhZGIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQfD8I5u9Wr_HH3Mk133wyEZwLmX6ZZSO7f1nbXbLB5n&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FKoss-KSC75-Portable-Stereophone-Headphones%2Fdp%2FB0006B486K%3Fth%3D1">Koss KSC75</a>. It costs $20, but judging purely on audio quality, it’s better than some headphones priced closer to $100. This pair is very obviously devoid of deep bass, so you won’t get that full-bodied <em>oomph</em> from in-game effects. You also won't hear all the intricate details you'd pick up with the pricier headphones above. But it locates sounds accurately and its open design gives it a real sense of width. It’s a superb value for competitive play.</p><p>The catch is that it’s built like a set of free airline headphones. The KSC75 has an odd clip-on design that, while lightweight, won’t be comfortable for everyone. It certainly looks like it costs $20, though Koss backs it with a <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2tvc3MuY29tL3BhZ2VzL3dhcnJhbnR5LXJlcGFpciIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYTZmYTY3YTctNzZhOC00ZWYxLTljOGQtNTljNDYzY2IzYWRiIn0&amp;signature=AQAAATq3XDDgE-dSvLRyTZM88jDPxijB4fPBTFoX-Vj8QyK1&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fkoss.com%2Fpages%2Fwarranty-repair">lifetime warranty</a> that essentially lets you get endless replacements for $9 each. Even if the KSC75 are pushing 20 years old, its sound remains relatively well-balanced and particularly well-suited for gaming.</p><h2>Best gaming headset: Astro A40 TR</h2><p></p><p>If you must have a dedicated gaming headset with a built-in mic, consider the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDdOU1JZREg5P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXNtLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhNmZhNjdhNy03NmE4LTRlZjEtOWM4ZC01OWM0NjNjYjNhZGIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAevIZTvveh8dqiw9CG4f9NRCLh028Al8JIaATGwTlTA3&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07NSRYDH9">Astro A40 TR</a>. Another open-back pair, it has a more spacious soundstage than usual for the category – though it's not on par with better non-gaming headphones – and it generally localizes sounds correctly. This profile emphasizes the bass, giving explosions a smooth and satisfying thump, but it doesn’t overdo it like many other headsets marketed toward gaming.</p><p>The sound here is still a step behind the DT 900 Pro X or HD 560S, especially for online shooters, as the pushed upper-bass and lower-mids can blunt finer details a bit more. Footsteps usually won’t sound as clear. But compared to most gaming headsets, the A40’s profile is better balanced, and it does well to envelop you in the sounds of a busy scene.</p><p>Comfort shouldn’t be an issue, either. The A40 is on the bulkier side, but its weight is evenly distributed and doesn’t clamp down overly hard. The fuzzy earpads are soft and breathable, while the earcups are roomy enough to fit larger ears. The headset has the usual open-back shortcomings, though: It leaks a bunch of sound and blocks almost zero outside noise. The design looks “gamer-y," too, and there’s no built-in volume control. The whole thing is mostly made of plastic, though it doesn’t come off as flimsy.</p><p>The A40’s mic, meanwhile, is just OK. It picks up background noises while you chat, and voices sound somewhat muffled. It’s serviceable but you’d buy the A40 for its sound quality first. The mic isn’t detachable either, but you can easily flip it up and out of the way.</p><p>The A40 has been around for four years now, but its price has come down from $150 to a more reasonable $130 in that time. Astro sells an optional <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-best-dac-for-lossless-high-resolution-music-iphone-android-160056147.html">DAC</a> with extra controls for $130, but at that price we’d strongly advise buying a good “normal” headphone and external mic.</p><h2>Best budget gaming headset: HyperX Cloud Stinger 2</h2><p></p><p>You won’t find a good open-back gaming headset under $50, so if you’re on a tight budget and require a built-in mic, you’ll have to compromise on sound quality. With that in mind, the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9IeXBlclgtQ2xvdWQtU3Rpbmdlci1Td2l2ZWwtTXV0ZS9kcC9CMEI4UEdETVdLLz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1zbS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYTZmYTY3YTctNzZhOC00ZWYxLTljOGQtNTljNDYzY2IzYWRiIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAfh2E5Ka9uLQvooXb479JP4pK_Z0_40HFg_nNxE4Yv0q&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FHyperX-Cloud-Stinger-Swivel-Mute%2Fdp%2FB0B8PGDMWK%2F">HyperX Cloud Stinger 2</a> is a decent buy at its typical street price of $40. Its mic belies that low price, making voices sound relatively clear and accurate. In fact, it’s a clear step-up from the Astro A40. It’s not detachable but it’s flexible and automatically mutes when you slide it out of the way. This pair also gets the comfort part right, as the pleather earcups don’t clamp down hard and have enough soft padding where it counts.</p><p>The Cloud Stinger 2 has a V-shaped sound profile, which is to say it exaggerates the bass and treble while recessing the mid-range. It’s not bad for what it is, and it’ll definitely give action scenes a heavy sense of impact. But the upper-bass is pushed to the point where it may get tiring over time, and you lose some of the fine details you’d hear on a more natural-sounding headphone. Since this is a cheap closed-back headset, the Cloud Stinger 2 also doesn’t sound nearly as wide as the pairs above, nor is it as nuanced about positioning sounds accurately. It’s less than ideal for competitive games as a result, though it can still sound “fun” with many other titles.</p><p>Beyond that, the plastic design feels cheap-ish, it doesn’t block much outside noise despite being closed-back and its cable isn’t removable. Nevertheless, you have to pick your battles in this price range. The Cloud Stinger 2 is flawed, but it does enough well to make sense for a certain type of person.</p><h2>A quick PSA on wireless gaming headsets</h2><p>Most people do not need a wireless gaming headset. The PS5 and Xbox Series X/S have a headphone jack built into their controllers, and it's still readily available on the Switch and most gaming PCs. The cost of an OK wireless headset is usually higher than the cost of a comparable wired model, and for the money you often get worse audio quality and a less clear microphone on the wireless versions.

As a closed-back headphone, it also won’t sound as spacious or natural as the more open pairs above. (Wireless gaming headsets with an open-back design are virtually nonexistent.) It’s not bad by wireless gaming headset standards, and it generally places sounds in the right place; it’s just not tuned or designed as optimally as a pair like the Astro A40.</p><p>The headset itself is comfortable to wear for hours at a time, with plush padding that doesn’t feel too tight, though the faux leather material on the earpads may make your ears feel mildly warm. Everything is sturdy, and the headband is nicely flexible. The boom mic is also fine, though that’s relative to other wireless headsets. It cancels out background noise well and keeps voices legible, but they won’t sound as crisp or full-bodied as they could be on wired headphones with good mics. It's better than the A40, though.</p><p>A word of warning: Don’t bother with HyperX’s companion software. While you can use the company’s <a href="https://hyperx.com/pages/ngenuity">Ngenuity</a> app to customize the headset's EQ and activate a <a href="https://dts.com/dts-headphonex/">DTS:X</a> surround sound feature, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HyperX/comments/uaiapq/hyperx_cloud_alpha_wireless_latency/">several users</a> have reported that this introduces noticeable latency, and HyperX <a href="https://xander51.medium.com/hyperxs-hilarious-fix-for-their-headset-driver-latency-issues-e80f39b9faff">doesn’t look</a> to be fixing it.

Its <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/327846/what-are-planar-magnetic-headphones/">planar-magnetic</a> drivers do well reproducing smaller intricacies in a given scene, and its default signature is like a more refined version of the common “gaming headset” sound. Bass is smooth and impactful but not bloated, while highs are crisp but not overly sharp. Some effects in the mids can sound thin, and as this is a<em>&nbsp;</em>closed-back headset, it can’t provide the same immersive width and precise imaging as the open-back models above. Ironically, it may be better for music than games. Still, for a wireless headset, it’s unusually pleasant and detailed. Audeze’s app includes several EQ presets as well.</p><p>Similarly, the Maxwell’s detachable boom mic is a standout. It does a phenomenal job of muting background noise, and while voices lose some air, they still sound clearer and fuller than on most wireless headsets we’ve tested.</p><p>The Maxwell is on the bulky side, and its headband uses an odd suspension mechanism that effectively isn’t adjustable without taking the headset off. The squishy padded ear cups will likely make your ears feel warm, but they keep the headset comfortable and isolate a fair amount of outside noise. The design also feels substantial, with the headband made from steel. The essential controls are built into the left earcup, and the device can connect over Bluetooth or a 3.5mm cable in addition to a USB-C wireless dongle. You can even pair with two devices at once, one over the dongle and another over Bluetooth. The headset needs to be powered on in order to play music over a cable, however.</p><p>Audeze rates the Maxwell’s battery life at roughly 80 hours, though you'll get less than that if you play at high volumes or use features like Bluetooth or sidetone heavily. While this can’t touch the Cloud Alpha Wireless, it’s still much better than most wireless headsets.</p><h2>Other notable gaming headsets</h2><figure><img alt="Logitech's G535 wireless gaming headset rests on top of a wicker chair on a patio outdoors." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/13435120-d960-11ed-bc67-dccf7cbeb8df" style="height: 1236px; width: 2000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget</div></figure><h3>SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro</h3><p>The <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ncC9wcm9kdWN0L0IwOVpXNTJYU1EvcmVmPW94X3NjX2FjdF90aXRsZV8xP3NtaWQ9QVRWUERLSUtYMERFUiZwc2M9MSZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1zbS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYTZmYTY3YTctNzZhOC00ZWYxLTljOGQtNTljNDYzY2IzYWRiIn0&amp;signature=AQAAATBDtCTmrhfdzRxzkwm41CS0WjvaetVcz3ro1ne9GIG1&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB09ZW52XSQ%2Fref%3Dox_sc_act_title_1%3Fsmid%3DATVPDKIKX0DER%26psc%3D1">SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro</a> is overpriced at $250, and it can make higher frequencies sound harsh, but its bass and mids are good, it’s super comfortable and its retractable mic is noticeably clearer than the Astro A40’s.

It’s old, but its plush earpads and headband remain comfy, and its detachable mic, while not superb, is still better than Astro’s pair.

It has a more neutral sound signature than the Cloud Alpha Wireless and Arctis Nova 7X: not flat, but less beholden to big, thumping bass. It can make mid-range details sound thin, and if anything it could use a little <em>more</em> sub-bass, but it’s an agreeable listen overall. It can also connect over Bluetooth. However, its mic gives up some fullness compared to the Cloud Alpha Wireless (which already wasn’t superb), and its 30-ish hours of battery life are a massive drop-off. Plus, it doesn’t work with Xbox, and it strangely forces you to crank the volume to reach a listenable level. But if you don’t want to spend a ton on a wireless headset, it’s the best of the $100-and-under options we tested.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-headset-130006477.html?src=rss

<p>WhatsApp has begun rolling out a handful of new security features. The most notable sees the company doing more to protect users against SIM jacking and other social engineering attacks that could compromise your account. The next time you download WhatsApp on a new device, you may be asked to use your old device to confirm you want to move your account to a new phone.</p><p>If you’re worried about the potential of being locked out of your account, a WhatsApp spokesperson told Engadget Account Protect will only activate if the company detects a suspicious registration attempt. Moreover, if you don’t have access to your old device, you can request the company send you a second one-time passcode.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Whether or not you decide to switch devices anytime soon, your WhatsApp account will be safer, thanks to the new introduction of <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://engineering.fb.com/2023/04/13/security/whatsapp-device-verification-protects-your-account">new background checks</a>. You won’t need to directly interact with the verification features WhatsApp is adding. Nonetheless, the company says they will help secure your account against malware, and better protect you if your WhatsApp is ever compromised.</p><p>Separately, WhatsApp is also making it easier for users to verify their connection with someone is encrypted. Right now, verifying your connection with someone involves either scanning a QR code or comparing a 60-digit number, both of which you can find by tapping the Encryption tab under a contact’s info sheet. Moving forward, tapping the tab will <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://engineering.fb.com/2023/04/13/security/whatsapp-key-transparency/">automatically verify</a> whether your connection is secure.</p><p>The new features will roll out to all WhatsApp users in the coming months. In the meantime, if you want to do the most you can to secure your account, WhatsApp parent company Meta recommends you enable <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/1278661612895630">two-factor authentication</a> and <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/490592613091019">encrypted backups</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-makes-it-harder-for-scammers-to-steal-your-account-130054789.html?src=rss

<p>DJI unveiled its latest high-end drone for professional filmmakers today. The Inspire 3 is a full-frame 8K cinema drone in a “highly portable form factor” that can be yours this summer for a mere $16,499.</p><p>The DJI Inspire 3 has a Zenmuse X9-8K Air Gimbal Camera with a wide range of dynamic colors and compatibility with various lenses. Its camera system has dual native ISO for clear low-light footage while covering over 14 stops of dynamic range to help capture highlights and shadows in sunrises and sunsets. It has a Tilt Boost and 360-degree Pan structures. Its FPV camera, visual sensors, positioning antennas and storage slot are “seamlessly integrated into the airframe for a minimalist look and modern industrial aesthetics.” It can capture video in various formats, including CinemaDNG and Apple ProRes RAW.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The drone supports RTK-powered Waypoint Pro and omnidirectional sensing for precise flight paths and improved safety. The drone has nine sensors to help detect and avoid obstacles and protect your $16.5K purchase. In addition, you can toggle horizontal, upward and downward obstacle-sensing independently and manually set its obstacle-alert range if the automatic function doesn’t suit your needs. (With active avoidance turned off, the display will still show incoming obstacles and sound an alert if it’s within a set range.) It also has hot-swappable TB51 intelligent dual batteries for up to 28 minutes of flight time and up to 58.4 mph speeds.</p><figure><img alt="Marketing photo of the DJI Inspire 3 drone, sitting in dramatic lighting on a gray surface." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/b524d5f0-d973-11ed-bf71-6fce1309d4a8" style="height: 3655px; width: 6092px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">DJI</div></figure><p>It uses DJI’s O3 Pro transmission and control system with a range of up to around 9.2 miles with one controller and up to 7.5 miles in dual-control mode (where one person pilots the drone and a second pilot controls the gimbal). It includes a first-person view (FPV) camera with an ultra-wide 161-degree field of view and night vision. The pilot’s feed has a latency of 90ms in 1080p / 60 fps mode. Additionally, it supports 4K / 30 fps feeds, although that mode reduces the drone’s range to an estimated 3.1 miles.</p><p>The DJI Inspire 3 will be available “by the end of June.” If you’re a pro filmmaker with over $16,000 to spare, you’ll get Zenmuse X9-8K Air Gimbal Camera, RC Plus remote controller and other accessories. The company’s DJI Care Pro accidental protection plans are also available for an additional cost.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/djis-newest-drone-is-a-16k-model-for-pro-filmmakers-130047974.html?src=rss

## ASUS' ROG Phone 7 uses A.I. to automatically record your wins and losses

<p>With last year's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-rog-phone-6-pro-pricing-availability-123058737.html">ROG Phone 6</a>, ASUS got our attention with the world's first &quot;wireless&quot; clip-on Peltier cooler, in the sense that it didn't require plugging into a power bank. That, along with a handful of dedicated gaming features — especially the customizable ultrasonic &quot;AirTriggers&quot; — already made it a seemingly solid gaming phone. While some of the competition <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-has-shut-down-its-legion-gaming-phone-business-082028564.html">struggled</a> to keep up, ASUS attempts to keep mobile gamers interested with its brand new ROG Phone 7 series which, for the first time, incorporates A.I. for automatic gaming capture. The company also managed to throw in a surprise for the new clip-on cooler: it now doubles as a subwoofer to take full advantage of the ROG Phone's already excellent stereo speakers.</p><p>The aforementioned A.I. feature can be found in the phone's &quot;Game Genie&quot; dashboard. Dubbed &quot;X Capture,&quot; this tool is based on ASUS' very own A.I. pattern recognition system, and it's supposedly able to detect key events such as a &quot;kill, death, victory moment, etc.&quot; in supported games. Another new tool, &quot;X Sense,&quot; uses the same algorithm and pop-up notifications to help the player with in-game decision making. The catch is that both A.I. features only support <em>Arena of Valor</em> for now, and only in &quot;tier one&quot; markets like Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. That said, the product team is apparently already working on supporting more titles, which will no doubt come in handy for gamers who like to show off.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You'll also find two more new gaming features: &quot;vibration mapping&quot; lets you add tactile feedback to your desired virtual buttons, and &quot;background mode&quot; — though already introduced to recent models via an update last year — lets games run in the background when you need to perform certain automatic boring tasks.</p><figure><img alt="ASUS ROG Phone 7's rapid-cycle vapor chamber uses trident-shaped wick column structures and six liquid return channels to improve heat dissipation." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/291cac00-d9e0-11ed-bfd7-193ba81e1a9b" style="height: 900px; width: 1600px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">ASUS</div></figure><p>Naturally, the core specs here offer the latest and greatest that the market has to offer right now. The ROG Phone 7 series pack Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor, up to 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM and up to 512GB of UFS 4.0 storage — a more efficient offering than the earlier UFS 3.1, with at least twice the speed. You still get a generous 6,000mAh dual-cell battery with 65W fast-charging, which now offers a slightly shorter charging time of 42 minutes. The 6.78-inch Samsung AMOLED display features the same 2,448 x 1,080 resolution, 165Hz refresh rate and 720Hz touch-sampling rate as before, but its peak brightness has been bumped up from 1,200 nits to 1,500 nits for better viewing.</p><p>As with previous generations, the ASUS ROG Phone 7 series comes with improved thermal design. This time it's all about the bigger rapid-cycle vapor chamber design, and it has two nerdy features: the special trident-shaped wick columns on the long edges vastly increase the surface area for better heat dissipation, and the six liquid-return channels act as highways for cooled water to flow back to the processor. ASUS claims this design increases heat dissipation efficiency &quot;by up to 168%.&quot; This is complemented with the Boron Nitride thermal compound on the other side of the CPU, as well as bigger graphite sheets covering the mainboard and RF board.</p><figure><img alt="ASUS ROG Phone 7 Ultimate with AeroActive Cooler 7 installed." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/bcadefc0-d9e4-11ed-affe-15c2158c8699" style="height: 1000px; width: 1600px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">ASUS</div></figure><p>Then there's the new AeroActive Cooler 7 which continues to offer Peltier thermoelectric cooling, and without the need of external power. Similar to its predecessor, this attachment can apparently lower the surface temperature by as much as 25 degrees Celsius, as well as the touch panel temperature by as much as eight degrees Celsius. As with last year's Ultimate variant, the more premium ROG Phone 7 Ultimate comes with the &quot;AeroActive Portal&quot; which, when used with the AeroActive Cooler 7, allows cool air to be blown straight into the phone's body. As a bonus, both the regular and Ultimate models are now IP54-certified (so both dust- and splash-resistant), despite the latter's air vent.</p><p>According to ASUS' own hour-long tests using <em>Genshin Impact</em>, the ROG Phone 7 Ultimate (in &quot;X Mode+&quot; performance) equipped with the attachment (in &quot;frosty&quot; cooling mode) was at least 6.4 degrees Celsius cooler than the competition — namely the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra — on the back. Keeping the ROG Phone 7 Ultimate cool allowed the game to sustain an impressive frame rate of around 60 fps, which should avoid interruptions in an intense fight.</p><p>The AeroActive Cooler 7 also comes with a set of four extra mappable buttons and, for the first time, a subwoofer as well. So yes, together with the enlarged speakers on the ROG Phone 7, you're getting a 2.1-channel audio system tuned by Dirac. You can also stick to your 3.5mm headphones and take advantage of the &quot;Dirac Virtuo For Headphone&quot; spatial sound feature, or go wireless with Snapdragon Sound's super-low-latency Bluetooth.</p><p>There's nothing too exciting on the photography side. The rear cameras remain unchanged: you get a 50-megapixel main camera (Sony's IMX766 sensor), a 13-megapixel ultra-wide angle camera (125 degrees) and a not-so-useful 5-megapixel macro camera. That said, ASUS claims that the cameras here will benefit from an improved light trail mode for artistic captures. The selfie camera on the other side, however, has been upgraded with a new 32-megapixel OmniVision OV32C sensor.</p><figure><img alt="ASUS ROG Phone 7 Ultimate" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/d78573b0-d9ec-11ed-aefb-5f91f5d9e18e" style="height: 1000px; width: 1600px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">ASUS</div></figure><p>For those who are in Taiwan and Europe, select models in the ROG Phone 7 series will be available for pre-order starting today. The regular model starts from €999, but if you're going for the Ultimate version for its AeroActive Portal and customizable ROG Vision screen on the back, it starts from €1,399 — you'll get a €110 AeroActive Cooler 7 for free. (All euro prices are inclusive of VAT.)</p><p>As for the rest of us, ASUS has confirmed that the ROG Phone 7 series will eventually be launched in the US, but we'll have to wait a bit longer for a date and pricing, so stay tuned.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/asus-rog-phone-7-ultimate-gaming-phone-pricing-availability-123037730.html?src=rss

<p>The Library of Congress has announced the latest batch of 25 recordings joining the National Recording Registry. Alongside songs like “Like a Virgin,” &quot;All I Want For Christmas Is You&quot; and &quot;Stairway To Heaven,&quot; Koji Kondo's <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> theme becomes the first piece of video game music to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-mario-theme-joins-your-old-tweets-in-the-library-of-congress-170502649.html">enter the registry</a>. According to the Library of Congress, the Mario overworld music, officially titled &quot;Ground Theme,&quot; is &quot;perhaps the most recognizable video game theme in history.&quot;</p><p>“The amount of data that we could use for music and sound effects was extremely small, so I really had to be very innovative and make full use of the musical and programming ingenuity that we had at the time,” Kondo told the Library of Congress. He apparently drew from Japanese jazz fusion and Latin music to create the melody on the Nintendo Entertainment System's five-channel sound chip.

<p>IK Multimedia has a launched a new audio interface with features designed specifically for guitar and bass players. Like the brand’s other products in the category, this model, the AXE I/O ONE, is portable and affordable: It’s currently available from the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c77776cd-956c-41ab-9a68-eadfbcc0ac19&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=IK+Multimedia&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjNzc3NzZjZC05NTZjLTQxYWItOWE2OC1lYWRmYmNjMGFjMTkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaWttdWx0aW1lZGlhLmNvbS9heGVpb29uZSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNjcwMDgzMmUtNDk5MS00M2RlLWI2YjEtMmNlNGU3OTVjOGU1In0&amp;signature=AQAAAavicUtruuaL3svIcLw_2iyMalit8U_ammQabsqupMO-&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikmultimedia.com%2Faxeioone">company’s online store</a> and from authorized retailers for $130.&nbsp;</p><p>Users can change a guitar’s input from a tighter and sharper tone to a thicker and bolder one using AXE I/O ONE’s Z-TONE input circuit.  The audio interface also comes with JFET input that enables warm, tube-like sounds. An external volume pedal gives users access to hands-free control, so they don’t have to stop playing to navigate the accompanying software. There’s also a dedicated Amp Out port, which among other things, allow users to have a hybrid setup with a real and a virtual guitar.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition, the  AXE I/O ONE comes bundled with thousands of AmpliTube 5 SE presets and TONEX SE tone models. TONEX SE also gives users a way to convert a real rig into a plug-in, so they can have even more rigs to use within their programs. Finally, this audio interface only needs to be plugged in via USB-C and doesn’t need an external power supply. Since the AXE I/O ONE has a compact design and is compatible with the latest iPads, as well, it sounds like IK Multimedia created it for especially for people who need or prefer to record on the go.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ik-multimedias-axe-io-one-is-an-affordable-audio-interface-for-guitar-and-bass-players-090631338.html?src=rss

## Google Maps will help you navigate US national parks

<p>Google is <a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/google-maps-update-national-parks-features/">updating Maps</a> with more detailed information about national parks in the US to make them easier to navigate and potentially prevent from getting lost. When you search for a particular park on Android or iOS, you’ll now see photos and videos of its key attractions — say the Old Faithful or the Grand Prismatic Spring at Yellowstone — taken by others who’d been there before.&nbsp;</p><p>Maps will now also highlight an entire trail from beginning to end when you search for it instead of just dropping a pin on its general location. You’ll even find details regarding its difficulty, along with information on whether it’s more suitable for walking, running or cycling. To make it even more informative, Google will show other people’s reviews of parks and trails, along with other useful details, such as where to find the nearest public bathroom.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Since national parks are huge and are often confusing, Google will start highlighting park entrances later this month, as well, with Maps pointing you right to the trailhead. Finally, Google will make it possible to download offline maps for parks so that you don’t have to worry about not being able to find your way if you suddenly lose access to the internet. Downloadable maps will also available later this month.&nbsp;</p><p>These features will initially roll out for national parks in the US, but Google plans to make Maps more useful to hikers around the world and will add more detailed information for national parks in other countries later this month. If you want to virtually explore a park first, though, you can hit up Google Street View where you can find imagery for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-02-11-google-street-view-adds-national-parks.html">dozens of national parks</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-maps-will-help-you-navigate-us-national-parks-061725188.html?src=rss

## ‘Endless Dungeon’ release has been pushed back to October 19th

<p>Looking forward to playing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/endless-dungeon-preview-170954815.html"><em>Endless Dungeon</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>next month? Unfortunately, you’ll have to wait half a year longer to play the roguelite twin-stick shooter, because Amplitude Studios and Sega have <a href="https://sega.prezly.com/endless-dungeon-delayed-to-october-19-2023">pushed back</a> its release date to October 19th. It was previously slated for a 2022 debut, but the developer ultimately announced a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/endless-dungeon-release-date-pc-xbox-playstation-switch-163232006.html">May 18th, 2023 launch date</a> for the PC (Steam and Epic), Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. In a <a href="https://community.amplitude-studios.com/amplitude-studios/endless-dungeon/blogs/882-endless-dungeon-delayed-to-the-19th-october">post announcing</a> their decision, the team said they believe it’s important to spend extra time working on the game after all the feedback they received across all their OpenDev sessions. They also promised to announce a release date for the Nintendo Switch at a later date.</p><p>In addition to fixing the bugs and issues the testers had unearthed, the developers are planning to use the extra time to improve some of the game’s key elements. They’re working to make player progression feel less random and more organic, and they’re tweaking the economy so that all three resources — namely, science, food and industry — feel important to the game. “The scarcity of resources is important so that your decision of what to invest in feels impactful,” they explained. They’re also incorporating smaller changes, such as differentiating the districts from each other more and improving certain aspects of the game’s multiplayer mode.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you decide to wait instead of canceling your pre-order, you can get three additional free skins for Comrade, Fassie and Shroom. They’ll also be available at no additional cost for early buyers upon the game’s release for a limited time. Take note that since the <em>Endless Dungeon‘s</em> release has been delayed, its planned Closed Beta, which you’ll be able to access if you purchase the Last Wish Edition, will also be pushed back to September.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/endless-dungeon-release-has-been-pushed-back-to-october-19th-030202242.html?src=rss

## The Polyend Tracker Mini is a powerful and portable studio in a box

<p>Easily one of the most fascinating devices I've had the pleasure of reviewing is the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/polyend-tracker-groovebox-sampler-review-170118746.html">Polyend Tracker</a>. It's hard to overstate what a unique piece of hardware it is. The company followed up last year with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/polyend-play-sampler-groovebox-superbooth-100043169.html">Play</a>, another sample-based groovebox that took a more immediate approach to music creation. Now the company is back, yet again, taking its undeniable sampling prowess mobile with the <a href="https://polyend.com/tracker-mini/">Tracker Mini</a>.</p><p>The Mini takes the core workflow of the original Tracker and shrinks it down to something under one pound, and just 6.7 by 5.1 inches. That's not the smallest groovebox in the world, but quite a bit smaller than something like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roland-sp-404-mkii-hands-on-dragging-an-iconic-sampler-into-the-modern-age-070043439.html">SP-404 MKII</a>. It retains full compatibility with the Tracker though, so you can start a song in the studio and finish it on the go, or vice versa.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="f69b43d2e5ee41a08a22b2ee15b752f6"></div><p>The Tracker Mini does lack the satisfying jog wheel, versatile pads and FM radio, but it does gain a microphone and a built-in battery. What's more, it actually has more memory and a faster CPU, so the Mini can hold up to eight minutes of mono samples in its pool, up from just two. Plus it supports audio over USB, stereo sampling and even comes with it's own hard case — a must have for protecting your music making gear on the go.</p><p>The 4310 mAh batter should last up to eight hours on a charge, though that will largely depend on how you're using the device, obviously. The mechanical keyboard style controls and jog wheel are replaced with gamepad style buttons. It may make navigating the interface slightly more difficult, but many of the shortcut and function keys made the transition. So creating a track shouldn't require to much menu diving or gratuitous button presses.&nbsp;</p><p>Most importantly, though, it has eight tracks of audio and / or MIDI, all the same sample editing tools, effects, beat slicing features, granular and wavetable synthesizers. It is easily capable of not just sketching out an idea, but building an entire song or even album. It looks likely to be one of the most powerful and interesting portable grooveboxes on the market when it starts shipping in July. You can preorder one now directly from <a href="https://polyend.com/tracker-mini/">Polyend</a> or through retailers like <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wZXJmZWN0Y2lyY3VpdC5jb20vcG9seWVuZC10cmFja2VyLW1pbmkuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYWQ3MDE2NjEtNzdlOS00OWJmLTgwZTItYTA4OGRkZGI2OGJiIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAUxFFZ4Tf_QVrK7z7xu_9FRgZ5lNC7hmrBgcfTyEhX6F&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.perfectcircuit.com%2Fpolyend-tracker-mini.html">Perfect Circuit</a> for $699.</p><div id="139aed7673ab4330be7eae994b5fdd14"></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-polyend-tracker-mini-is-a-powerful-and-portable-studio-in-a-box-001656705.html?src=rss
