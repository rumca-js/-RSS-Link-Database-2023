<p>Sayeeda Warsi was right to call out the home secretary over her deliberate strategy of racist rhetoric </p><p>Even in politics, and certainly in more normal settings, it takes a lot to challenge a colleague openly.

That is perhaps especially true when the critic and the colleague share a political party and both are from ethnic minorities. All of these concerns, Sayeeda Warsi wrote this week, went through her mind before she finally penned the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/12/suella-braverman-diversity-cabinet-british-pakistani-men-rishi-sunak" title="">Guardian article</a> accusing the home secretary, Suella Braverman, of racism and of “playing politics in the gutter” after she had branded British Pakistani men as child sex abusers.</p><p>However difficult, writing the article was the right thing to do.

<p>Censorship is surging thanks to an organised rightwing minority targeting books on LGBTQ and Black characters and issues</p><p>“A book is a loaded gun in the house next door,” warns a character in Fahrenheit 451, Ray Bradbury’s dystopian vision of an America where books are considered so dangerous they must be incinerated. The novel appeared 70 years ago, in the aftermath of Nazi book burnings and amid McCarthyism and Soviet ideological repression. But the urge to ban books has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/sep/20/librarians-banned-books-attacks-library" title="">resurged</a> with a vengeance, with the American Library Association (ALA) recording a doubling of <a href="https://www.ala.org/news/press-releases/2023/03/record-book-bans-2022" title="">censorship attempts</a> in 2022, to 1,269 across 32 states: the highest rate for decades. Pen America, which champions freedom of expression, tallied more than <a href="https://pen.org/report/banned-usa-growing-movement-to-censor-books-in-schools/" title="">2,500 cases</a> in the last school year.</p><p>These attempts are not merely more numerous but are also broadening and deepening. The decisions of school boards and districts take place in the context of politicians <a href="https://oracle.newpaltz.edu/texas-pulls-over-130-the-largest-book-ban-in-decades/" title="">grasping electoral advantage</a> and punitive yet often <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/teachers-hampshire-face-legal-threats-teaching-called-divisive/story?id=81213142" title="">vaguely worded state laws</a> on education – such as the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis’s, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/18/judge-florida-ron-desantis-stop-woke-law" title="">Stop-Woke Act</a>. At least 10 states have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/08/17/book-ban-restriction-access-lgbtq/" title="">passed legislation</a> increasing parental power over library stock, or limiting students’ access. In place of spontaneous challenges to single titles come challenges to multiple titles, organised by campaign groups such as <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/166373/moms-liberty-schools-nightmare-midterms" title="">Moms for Liberty</a>.

This exciting new technology already offers journalists, whether from mainstream media or niche online sites, the promise of rapid newsgathering, analysis of complex data and near-instantaneous stories written to order. Almost irresistible, especially for news publishers on a budget. But the potential threats to news authenticity, the difficulty for both journalists and consumers in verifying seemingly plausible information, and the near certainty of bad actors creating convincing but spurious content get more concerning the more you think of them.</p><p>This is a challenge for all media. With audio and video increasingly capable of digital generation, the risk to the reputation of print, online and broadcast journalism requires an industry-wide response. It is urgent that publishers and regulators come together to agree best practice.

<p><strong>Arcola, London<br /></strong>What starts as a comedy of sibling manners ends in a soap opera-like recital of childhood abuses and family grievances</p><p>The question of what we inherit from our parents has been keeping psychologists busy for decades, and playwrights for far longer. In Joanne Lau’s new play, Worth, four siblings come together on the day of their mother’s funeral in search of a very literal inheritance. They discover, over the course of a manic treasure hunt, that a more potent legacy is hidden inside each of them – and not in a good way.</p><p>Against the backdrop of Moi Tran’s enjoyably detailed set, the sibling dynamics quickly reveal themselves. First-born Jacob, played by a suitably swaggering Arthur Lee, is recently out of prison and alpha male-ing it over the comically needy Teddy (Stephen Hoo) and placatory Penny (Jennifer Lim); he can’t even be bothered to learn the name of his nephew, Anthony (a joyously brattish Leo Buckley). Sara Chia-Jewell plays May, the baby of the family, who has flown in from the US trailing a blend of sanctimony and victimhood. Here is a woman who believes wheelie suitcases are immoral because if you’re going to carry something with you, you should feel its weight. “There are consequences,” she tells Teddy ominously.</p><p>Worth is at the Arcola theatre, London, <a href="https://www.arcolatheatre.com/whats-on/worth/">until 29 April</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/apr/13/worth-review-darkly-comic-inheritance-drama">Continue reading...</a>

Addressing the issue  doesn’t need to alienate your son</p><p><strong>My son and I are particularly close and have always enjoyed a loving friendship and understanding of each other, despite him living and working overseas for the past 13 years. We’ve always communicated regularly via various channels. After my father – his dear Opa – passed away in 2019, he partnered for the first time. We were overjoyed that he’d found love and while Covid restrictions kept us apart and communication became a little more intermittent, we remained connected.</strong></p><p><strong>Since travelling again and meeting his partner, things have drastically altered. His partner has taken quite an obvious dislike of my husband and me. We have tried everything we know in the playbook of respecting a new relationship, while maintaining our own, but nothing is working. He is perfectly fine with us without his partner, however we are all on eggshells when she is present. Cultural differences aside, we simply do not understand. I feel I should ask her if there’s anything specific I may have done to cause her disdain, however I am being dissuaded by those I love and trust.

Asked by a loitering reporter what he thought the score would be, Boehly bullishly announced: “Chelsea’s going to win 3-0.” It was a bold prediction and one he appeared to make without first consulting waiter-baiter and TV funnyman James Corden, before a game in which a team bottomed out on confidence and without a goal in four were due to take on the defending champions in their own Bernabéu building site. Madrid duly strolled to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/12/real-madrid-chelsea-champions-league-quarter-final-first-leg-match-report">a comfortable 2-0 victory</a> without really breaking sweat and the only consolation Frank Lampard and his players (all 58 of them) can take from yet another bruising experience is that their margin of victory was not so wide as to render the tie completely unsalvageable.</p><p>Of course it is all too easy to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/apr/12/real-madrid-force-todd-boehly-to-eat-his-words-after-chelsea-win-prediction" title="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/apr/12/real-madrid-force-todd-boehly-to-eat-his-words-after-chelsea-win-prediction">mock Chelsea</a>, albeit that is no reason not to, but can we not give them some credit for their innovative tactics? I’m sure we are all thoroughly enjoying their strategy of paying lots of money for attacking midfielders that look nice, drift past opposition defenders into very promising positions and then constantly kick the ball straight to the goalkeeper. The great Italian journalist Gianni Brera stated that the perfect game of football would finish 0-0 and Chelsea are almost there. They just need to convince the rest of the footballing world to start doing the same” – Noble Francis.</p><p>The Polish match officials are aggrieved by a bizarre call that led to their expulsion from a match (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/12/football-daily-polish-match-officials-greece">yesterday’s Football Daily</a>)?

<p><strong>Zacharias/Koustas/London PO/Brabbins<br />(BIS)<br /></strong>Violinist George Zacharias’s belief in this hugely demanding music shines through, but the stylistic differences between the concertos is bewildering<strong><br /></strong></p><p>Outside his native Greece, the music of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nikos-Skalkottas">Nikos Skalkottas</a> still remains little known. In the decades following his death in 1949, at the age of 45, it seemed as if Skalkottas might eventually come to be seen as one of the more significant of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/arnold-schoenberg">Schoenberg’s</a> pupils; the distinguished musicologist Hans Keller even hailed him as one of the four “great Ss” of 20th-century music, alongside Stravinsky, Shostakovich and Schoenberg. But that recognition has never materialised. In western Europe performances of his major works are as rare as ever and some parts of his output remain little explored, with the result that this is the first ever recording of the Concerto for Violin, Viola and Wind.</p><p>Both it and the Violin Concerto belong to the most productive phase of Skalkottas’s composing career, the 10 years or so after he returned to Greece when the Nazis took power in Germany. During that time he developed his own, idiosyncratic version of Schoenberg’s 12-note method, a composing technique that owed a lot to his early career as a violinist, and it’s heard to best effect in the violin concerto composed in 1938. It’s a tough, three-movement work lasting half an hour and tracing out a sonata structure; the musical language is clearly indebted to Schoenberg, and occasionally to Berg’s violin concerto too, but the textures seem denser, the orchestral writing busier, with an intensity that seems distinctively personal.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/13/skalkottas-violin-concerto-concerto-for-violin-viola-and-wind-review">Continue reading...</a>

It is populated with references pulled from her upbringing in her south Asian family in Pollokshields, just round the corner from the Glasgow gallery.</p><p>A giant replica Axminster carpet takes centre stage. Suspended above it is a vast print of the sky, expanded from an image taken in nearby Pollok Park.

Snaking across the print is a surreally long football scarf with the word LOOOOONGING knitted into it. A tracksuit lies close by, coloured the luminous orange of Irn-Bru and emblazoned with the words “CAN’T DO IT”.

## These weight-loss drugs are tempting – but I won’t use them | Jay Rayner

<p>I’ve never been thin. But if these anti-obesity drugs put me off my dinner, count me out</p><p>When I was an adolescent, large of thigh and round of belly, I dreamed of a drug that would make me thin: a couple of pills a day, similar to aspirin, which would render me slender and gorgeous so that the girls I wanted to snog would stop thinking of me only as best friend material. Now I am an adult, large of thigh and round of belly, and it seems the very drug I dreamed of has arrived. It is a weekly injection called semaglutide and it promises immense results. The NHS has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/mar/12/explainer-new-skinny-jab-has-been-approved-by-the-nhs-but-does-it-work-and-can-you-buy-it">been given the go-ahead</a> to prescribe it for weight loss or you can get it from private clinics. For a couple of hundred quid a month, you can jack yourself up on a drug which, by mimicking the hormone that makes you feel full, acts as a magnificent appetite suppressant. The excess weight falls away. My fantasy future is here.</p><p>It’s sold under the brand names Wegovy and Ozempic, which sound comfortingly like self-assembly bookshelves from Ikea, and they really do sound great. Until you get to the common <a href="https://www.wegovy.com/taking-wegovy/side-effects.html" title="">side-effects</a>: nausea, diarrhoea and in many cases a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/nov/09/i-miss-eating-weight-loss-drug-ozempic-food-repulsive" title="">desperate sense of revulsion at the very thought of food</a>. It’s as if the pharmaceutical companies’ new product development departments had taken their inspiration from an early episode of the ribald, gloriously filthy animated series <em>Rick and Morty</em> in which the devil sets up shop handing out enchanted items which come with curses. He gives lonely Mr Goldenfold an aftershave which makes him irresistible to women. Only it also makes him impotent. Well now, here’s the real-life version: yes, this drug will make you lose weight, arse over thigh, but it will also make you hate the thing you once most loved. As the devil says: ‘<a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1089226891174132" title="">A price for everything, Mr Goldenfold</a>. A price for everything.’</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/apr/13/these-new-weight-loss-drugs-are-tempting-why-i-wont-use-them-wegovy-ozempic-semaglutide">Continue reading...</a>

## Metallica: 72 Seasons review | Alexis Petridis's album of the week

<p><strong>(Blackened)</strong><br />With weighty lyrics referencing James Hetfield’s ongoing recovery and harking back to the band’s formative British influences, 72 Seasons has the edge of Metallica’s 80s heyday – albeit one blunted by overlong songs</p><p>Metallica frontman James Hetfield has said their 11th studio album is rooted in the past, its title a reference to “the first 18 years of our lives, that form our true or false selves … Much of our adult experience is re-enactment or reaction to those childhood experiences”. You could take this as the talk of a man who has spent a lot of time in therapy. In 2019 Hetfield entered rehab again, an experience that clearly informs a chunk of 72 Seasons’ lyrics. “Temptation, temptation,” he keeps repeating as If Darkness Had a Son kicks in. Too Far Gone? draws on the Alcoholics Anonymous principle of approaching recovery one day at a time. Chasing Light has him “down and out”, shaking with “deep withdrawals”. “Come on, give the boy a break,” he pleads, “or he will break.”</p><p>But students of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/metallica">Metallica</a>’s musical roots may also find a different undercurrent in Hetfield’s statement. At the end of the time period he mentions, the band’s drummer Lars Ulrich had saved up his paper-round money and decamped to England in search of the new wave of British heavy metal: he ended up in Stourbridge, glomming on to Diamond Head, the NWoBHM’s luckless nearly-weres. Ultimately left for dust commercially by Iron Maiden and Def Leppard, Diamond Head nevertheless became a key influence on Metallica: Ulrich claimed the band simply “wouldn’t exist” without them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/13/metallica-72-seasons-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Leicester Square theatre, London<br /></strong>The comedian is at her best when she treats us as her confidantes rather than aiming for well-worn targets</p><p>On one day in 2021 two major life events – one terrible, one wonderful – coincided for “TV’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/oct/06/angela-barnes-standup-comedy-edinburgh-sarah-millican">Angela Barnes</a>” – so improbably that she can be excused for turning them into the narrative climax of her new show. How could she resist? That ending satisfyingly unites the threads of a 70-minute set tracing her journey through lockdown, her friendship with the late fellow standup Phil Jerrod and her recent marriage, so late in life (Barnes is 46) that the woman selling her a wedding dress had to counsel her against exposing her upper arms.</p><p>That comment gets short shrift, and very amusingly so, in a scene that throbs with the vitality (and resentment) of lived experience. There are other such moments, more as the show goes on, in which we feel we’re encountering the real Barnes behind the relatable, sometimes too generic standup. Some of the lockdown material (we drank a lot! We developed unlikely hobbies!) falls into that category, although the issue may simply be that lockdown material now feels like old hat.</p><p>Angela Barnes: Hot Mess is at the Watermark in Ivybridge on Friday, then <a href="https://www.angelabarnescomedy.co.uk/live/">touring</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/apr/13/angela-barnes-hot-mess-review-glimpses-of-the-real-comic-shine-through-generic-lines">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Lauren Book has led the fight against the ‘near-total’ ban and the ‘dangerous consequences’ of bill that is expected to pass the state house and to be signed by Governor DeSantis</p><p>Last week, Lauren Book, the top Democrat in the Florida senate – was placed in handcuffs, <a href="https://www.talgov.com/Main/News/5432">arrested</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/04/florida-democrats-arrested-abortion-ban-capitol-trespassing">charged with trespassing</a>, after refusing to leave an abortion rights demonstration near the state capitol building in Tallahassee Florida.</p><p>Hours before, Republican lawmakers in the state senate advanced the legislation, which would dramatically restrict the state’s current ban on abortion from 15 weeks of pregnancy to six weeks – before many women even realize they’re pregnant. Critics say the narrow window would amount to a “near-total” ban on abortions in the state.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/13/florida-democrat-lauren-book-fight-six-week-abortion-ban">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Evicted or driven out by rent rises, people are turning to caravans as a cheap option. Some love the lifestyle – but for others, it is cold and unsafe</p><p>Jake Lee moved into a caravan two years ago and has never been happier. Before buying his static in Moray, Scotland, Lee was a Londoner. Fifteen years earlier, he’d taken out an interest-only mortgage – or, as he puts it, “one of these mortgages that shouldn’t have been given out”. “I knew that I wasn’t going to be able to pay the 100 grand I owed,” he says. Selling up would settle the debt – but leave him very little money to buy or rent elsewhere. Then he stumbled across the idea of living in a caravan park. “Having done it, it is the best thing I’ve ever done. Because living in these places is brilliant!”</p><p>It’s certainly more popular than it was: <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/housing/bulletins/housingenglandandwales/census2021#:~:text=Across%20England%20and%20Wales%2C%2077.9,other%20mobile%20or%20temporary%20structure.">according to the Office for National Statistics</a>, in 2021 there were 104,000 households living in caravans or other temporary structures in England and Wales – 19,000 more than a decade before.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/apr/13/the-stress-is-overwhelming-the-highs-and-lows-of-starting-a-new-life-in-a-static-caravan">Continue reading...</a>

For <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/10/don-delillo-white-noise-a-novel-way-of-dismantling-consumerism" title="">Don DeLillo, in White Noise</a>, a supermarket “changes us spiritually, it prepares us, it’s a gateway … All the letters and numbers are here, all the colours of the spectrum, all the voices and sounds, all the code words and ceremonial phrases.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/oct/06/annie-ernaux-wins-the-2022-nobel-prize-in-literature" title="">Annie Ernaux, winner of the 2022 Nobel prize in literature</a>, sees supermarkets as a spectacle and a kind of commons. In no other space, private or public, are people “brought into greater contact with their fellow humans”.

<p>Serbian keeper is excited for a potential showdown with David de Gea in Europa League and discusses being attacked on the pitch</p><p>One morning in early March, a bunch of flowers were delivered to Sevilla’s Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán stadium. Addressed to goalkeeper Marko Dmitrovic, they had come from supporters at PSV Eindhoven, a card among the red and white carnations wishing him well and apologising on behalf of fans. “Dear Mister Dmitrovic,” it began, before closing with best wishes for the rest of the competition, which takes him to Old Trafford on Thursday night. “It’s a nice touch,” he says; it will also be different this time, he’s sure.</p><p>Different is the word, the first Dmitrovic uses. Asked to define this campaign, it works. “It’s crazy really,” he says. Sevilla, who were briefly contenders last season and qualified for the Champions League for a third consecutive year, now find themselves <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/sep/05/sevilla-slump-to-barcelona-showcases-sense-of-ambition-gone-awry-la-liga">fighting relegation</a>, having had as many managers as away wins, and dumped into the Europa League.

His use of exotic fabrics presented in this traditional English style was what first caught my eye, although he did have a thing for the Nehru collar.

<p>Always looking but never finding, my shopping trips can be a disorienting experience. I am forever lost between the aisles</p><p>Is shop blindness a thing? If it is, I’m afflicted. It happens when I’m in a big shop that sells millions of things and I simply can’t find what I’m looking for, even though I know it’s there. This happens most frequently in supermarkets, where paralysis of choice is often the problem. So many peanut butters. So many toilet rolls. So many washing powders. How? Why? And then there’s that thing they do where they move sections around. No sooner do you get used to the layout than it’s inexplicably all changed. The cooking oils go where the herbs and spices once were, which are now where the pulses were. I’ve struggled to locate the coconut milk ever since it first went on manoeuvres just before the pandemic. How much fun they must have watching us on CCTV, bewitched, bothered and bewildered, scurrying hopelessly up and down aisle after aisle. I forgive them. It must get boring running a supermarket. Let them have their sport.</p><p>It’s in Boots that I struggle the most, and I apportion no blame to them. I can just never get to what I’m looking for. I think it’s because most of the stuff they stock is of a similar, smallish size. I just see a retina-burning riot of colours with nothing coming into focus. I walk away, floss-less, vitamin-less, antacid-less, clueless. I have no idea if they’re guilty of moving stuff around because I so rarely find it in the first place.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/13/do-you-suffer-from-shop-blindness-ive-struggled-to-locate-coconut-milk-for-years">Continue reading...</a>

Keeping track of the band’s whereabouts in a fanclub magazine she and tens of thousands others received in the post each month, Furmanovsky read that McCartney had recently moved to St John’s Wood and decided to pay him a visit. “I took the picture outside his house,” she says. “The Beatles were very generous about that sort of thing. It would say: ‘Paul’s moved house’ – they’d virtually give you the address.”</p><p>In the half century since that spontaneous snapshot, the photographer has spent her career married to the moshpit. From the smouldering sex appeal of a young Billy Idol (with a kitten), to the Slits, the Clash and Siouxsie Sioux on stage, Furmanovsky’s lens has captured musicians with unfiltered intensity. Seemingly impervious characters elevated to godlike status become humbled in her lens, caught in moments of quotidian intimacy: Roger Waters jokes around with a cupcake during a studio session; Bob Marley, “entirely lovely” as Furmanovsky recalls, reclines in a haze of post-performance weed smoke. “He has a very happy expression on his face, but he was having a lot of problems with the police, so I thought it best to avoid actually showing him smoking – I’ve cut off where the spliff would have been.” A retrospective of her work at Manchester’s central library, guest curated by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/noel-gallagher">Noel Gallagher</a> – a frequent Furmanovsky subject – and photo historian Gail Buckland, pays homage to her this month.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/13/rock-photographer-jill-furmanovsky">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The tulip is a perennial hit – the most sold flower in the US, with one sold for every two people in 2020</p><p>The twigs outside my window have suddenly sprouted green bouquets and flashes of color are pushing up around the trees on the sidewalk. Spring is here and while I’m staring at the bunches on offer in my grocery store, I wonder which flower is everyone’s favorite.

<p>The rationalist in me knows that coincidences are inevitable, mundane, meaningless. But I can’t deny there is something strange and magical in them, too</p><p>In the summer of 2021, I experienced a cluster of coincidences, some of which had a distinctly supernatural feel. Here’s how it started. I keep a journal, and record dreams if they are especially vivid or strange. It doesn’t happen often, but I logged one in which my mother’s oldest friend, a woman called Rose, made an appearance to tell me that she (Rose) had just died. She had had another stroke, she said, and that was it. Come the morning, it occurred to me that I didn’t know whether Rose was still alive. I guessed not. She’d had a major stroke about 10 years ago and had gone on to suffer a series of minor strokes, descending into a sorry state of physical incapacity and dementia.</p><p>I mentioned the dream to my partner over breakfast, but she wasn’t much interested. We were staying in the Midlands at the time, in the house where I’d spent my later childhood years. The place had been unoccupied for months. My father, Mal, was long gone, and my mother, Doreen, was in a care home, drifting inexorably through the advanced stages of Alzheimer’s. We’d just sold the property we’d been living in, and there would be a few weeks’ delay in getting access to our future home, so the old house was a convenient place to stay in the meantime.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/13/are-coincidences-real">Continue reading...</a>

<p>She has been in the public eye for decades, yet precious little is known about King Charles’ longstanding paramour. We explore her tumultuous journey to the top</p><p>As of next month’s coronation, the Queen Consort will at last have ascended to the title of Queen – not Consort, not common-law, but fully legit Queen Camilla – without the world knowing much about her. There are some simple reasons why.</p><p>It’s partly because she never gives interviews and partly because she doesn’t reveal much in her actions, which are standardly royal, but not very disclosing: good deeds and horses, essentially. It’s partly because she has functioned, for decades, as a cipher for other conversations. What do we think of adultery, marriage, divorce, the royal family, the leisure class, the finer gradations of social hierarchy? Of Charles? Of Diana? These debates have played out in sometimes hideously microscopic detail, with Camilla as object, but never subject. The result is that she is never more obscure than when everyone is talking about her.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/13/unseen-camilla-the-five-ages-of-a-future-queen-from-mistress-to-monarchy">Continue reading...</a>
