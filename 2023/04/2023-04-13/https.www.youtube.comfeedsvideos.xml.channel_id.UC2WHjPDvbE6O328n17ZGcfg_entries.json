I also promised y\u2019all I\u2019d make a video about AI Tools for Software Engineers a few videos ago, and I\u2019m a man of my word.\n\nI\u2019ve been using and researching these tools to learn about what they can really do. You may have heard of a few of them, but I want to provide you with a few use cases of how they can fit into your software engineering workflow.\n\nA portion of this video is sponsored by Mailgun.\n\n------------------------\n\n\ud83d\udc31\u200d\ud83d\ude80 GitHub: https://github.com/forrestknight\n\ud83d\udc26 Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/forrestpknight\n\ud83d\udcbc LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/forrestpknight\n\ud83d\udcf8 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/forrestpknight\n \n\ud83d\udcd3 Learning Resources: \nMy Favorite Machine Learning Course:  https://imp.i384100.net/YgYEBJ\nOpen Source Computer Science Degree:  https://bit.ly/open-source-forrest\nPython Open Source Computer Science Degree:  https://bit.ly/python-open-source\nUdacity to Learn Any Coding Skill: http://bit.ly/udacity-forrest\n\n\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb My Coding Gear:\nMy NAS Server: https://amzn.to/3brqO7b\nMy Hard Drives: https://amzn.to/3aKetMi\nMy Main Monitor: https://amzn.to/3siQfPa\nMy Second Monitor: https://amzn.to/3keHT84\nMy Standing Desk: https://amzn.to/3boAcbC\nMy PC Build:  https://bit.ly/my-coding-gear\nMy AI GPU: https://amzn.to/3uvmUmz", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jArtVVbYGKk", "date_published": "2023-04-13 13:00:35+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
