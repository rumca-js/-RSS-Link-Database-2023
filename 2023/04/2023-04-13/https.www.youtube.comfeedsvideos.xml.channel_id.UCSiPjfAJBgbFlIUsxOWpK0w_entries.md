Hip hip for this cover of Island in the Sun, because I really did feel transported to an island beach somewhere with an umbrella in my fancy fruity drink. There were so many great moments throughout this song! Swatty’s high ditty on the keys made the whole song sound playful. Moira’s and Sara’s voices are so smooth and blend incredibly well, keeping everything mellow and relaxed. And Nick Campbell on the bass!?! He rarely needs introduction, but Jack’s countdown led to such a great drum and bass section by Nick and Ben that I was hooked by the time Brian’s guitar section came in. Such a fun cover, it’ll be on everyone’s summer music playlists!
