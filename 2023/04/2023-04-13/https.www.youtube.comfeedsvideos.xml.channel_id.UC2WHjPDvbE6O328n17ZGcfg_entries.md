AI is everywhere, and while I do believe AI as a whole will cause programming jobs to decrease over the next 5-10 years, there’s still a lot it can do for you today in large scale and personal projects. I also promised y’all I’d make a video about AI Tools for Software Engineers a few videos ago, and I’m a man of my word.

I’ve been using and researching these tools to learn about what they can really do. You may have heard of a few of them, but I want to provide you with a few use cases of how they can fit into your software engineering workflow.
