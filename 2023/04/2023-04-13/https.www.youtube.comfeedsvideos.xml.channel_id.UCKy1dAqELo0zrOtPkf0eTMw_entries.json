If you're interested in learning a little more about the upcoming Star Wars TV show, join us at Star Wars Celebration 2023 as we speak to Leslye Headland, the director of the upcoming Acolyte TV show. We also had a chance to talk to The Acolyte cast, including Lee Jung-jae, Charlie Barnett, Manny Jacinto, Dafne Keen, Jodie Turner-Smith, Joonas Suotamo, Rebecca Henderson, and Dean-Charles Chapman.\n\nThe Acolyte has been described as \"Kill Bill meets Frozen\", so we had to find out as much as we could about it at SWCE 2023. From when The Acolyte TV series takes place to some hints about the new Jedi, the cast tell us all they can about the upcoming TV show.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #StarWars", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkK2KCvniy4", "date_published": "2023-04-13 11:16:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Resident Evil 4 Remake: All Mercenaries Characters S++ Rank Gameplay", "description": "We run through the village level of Mercenaries Mode in the Resident Evil 4 Remake with one goal: get an S++ rank with every character.
