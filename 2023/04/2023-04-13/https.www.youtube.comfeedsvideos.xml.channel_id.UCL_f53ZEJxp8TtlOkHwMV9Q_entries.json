Peterson and Dr. Brian Keating discuss long-held theories of cosmology, from the big bang to the expansion of the universe, and why we might be totally wrong.\n\nDr. Brian Keating is a cosmologist, inventor, author, academic, and podcast host. He focuses on the exploration of the big bang, prodding current theories, and building arrays to test them. He has published two bestselling books: \u201cLosing the Nobel Prize\u201d in 2018 and \u201cThink Like a Nobel Prize Winner\u201d in 2021. Keating is the inventor of the BICEP and BICEP2 Array, which are used to study the inception of the universe, and he holds multiple patents for components found within these systems. Keating also hosts the podcast \u201cInto the Impossible,\u201d which boasts Nobel Prize winning guests, renowned scientists from across fields, and a continuous top ten spot in the science category.\n\nDr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8\n\n\n- Sponsors -\n\nShopify: Get a $1/ month FREE trial with full access to Shopify's entire suite of features: https://shopify.com/jbp \n\nElysium: Save $50 on your Index test!
