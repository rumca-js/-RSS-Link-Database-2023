Check out Clive in action in Final Fantasy 16 showcasing the real time action. Additionally check out the epic Eikon battles that were showcased during the State of Play Presentation.

Final Fantasy XVI will feature classic Final Fantasy summons as Eikons. Controlling Clive, you'll encounter these various Eikons and have to battle against them to win their favor, and have them join your side. While that isn't a new element to Final Fantasy games, what is new is the ability to fully control these Eikons, and use them to help battle against other Eikons. As shown in this trailer, these Eikon battles will completely change the overall gameplay, and merge seamlessly with the normal battle structure. Expect to see classic summons like Ifrit, Titan, Bahamut, Phoenix, Typhon, and more once FFXVI releases on June 22, 2023.
