Upon reading this news, Megyn Kelly went bananas. As did *waves hands around* all of us.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">You tried that. It didn‚Äôt work.<br />Then you declared you are ‚Äúa girl‚Äù & got corporate $ galore.<br />Now you want ppl to say what‚Äôs interesting about you is not your <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/womanface?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#womanface</a> but the person behind it who was already rejected?<br />How much pretending would you like us to do? <a href="https://t.co/20W2EYo5I4">https://t.co/20W2EYo5I4</a><br />‚Äî Megyn Kelly (@megynkelly) <a href="https://twitter.com/megynkelly/status/1652091012205117441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 28, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>You tried that.

Now you want ppl to say what‚Äôs interesting about you is not your </span><span style="background-color: initial;">#womanface</span> but the person behind it who was already rejected? How much pretending would you like us to do?</blockquote><p>We go with "titface" (shout out Joe Cunningham), but we never claimed to have Kelly's degree of professionalism.<br /></p><p>Kelly was responding to <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/04/28/dylan-mulvaney-brands-should-want-me-for-me-not-just-for-being-trans/" target="_blank">an interview the TikTok ing√©nue did</a> where Dylan opened up about <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/bud-light-leave-absence" target="_blank">almost bankrupting Bud Light</a>. Dylan doesn't want companies to want to partner with them just to ‚Äúcheck a box‚Äù because she's trans. He wants them to want her for them.</p><blockquote>A lot of brands will ask, ‚ÄòCould you relate a little bit of your struggle growing up into this?‚Äô Like, no! If you want me, you want me because I‚Äôm Dylan, not because I‚Äôm trans.</blockquote><p>Dude, the only reason <strong><em>any company</em></strong> wants you is because you're trans. That, and I'm sure some of our right-wing outrage helps. The more we say "Hey, this is a bit much," the more the left triples down.</p><p>We saw it with drag queens. Minors would <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mashable-ten-year-old-drag-queen" target="_self">dress up like women and entertain adults in bars</a>. Conservatives said, "Hey, this seems inappropriate." The left doubled down with "<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mashable-ten-year-old-drag-queen" target="_self">Drag Queen Story Time</a>." Conservatives said, "Guys, let's leave children alone because this is wrong." Now the left acts like the ONLY way to teach someone about tolerance is with a guy dressed like a girl and shaking their ass in a kid's face.</p><p>Dylan makes HER money (<a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dylan-mulvaney-illegal-media-coverage" target="_blank">I don't want to get arrested</a>) partially because if companies don't sign a trans spokestrans for their brand it would mean those companies are literally insurrectionists in bed with MAGA literally. But most of it is because trans ranks #1 on the left's pound-for-pound most marginalized rankings and Dylan found a way to monetize it.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Watch: That chick on Twitter bragging about the microchip she has in her arm? She might be a lunatic

But y'all might want to let this one go.</p><p>Meet Tofana. She is super excited about the microchip in her arm.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Are you going to let them insert the microchip ? ü§î<br /><br />This is getting really dystopian. üò•<br /><br />üîä <a href="https://t.co/fDV5zth7D9">pic.twitter.com/fDV5zth7D9</a><br />‚Äî Wall Street Silver (@WallStreetSilv) <a href="https://twitter.com/WallStreetSilv/status/1651997997427830792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 28, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Here's the spoiler. She wasn't bragging about getting a microchip. In a follow-up video, she explained she was WARNING about the microchip. And that the government shut off her microchip.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Remember the woman who posted the video about getting her arm microchipped? She‚Äôs got an update. <a href="https://t.co/fuB1yTFXjt">pic.twitter.com/fuB1yTFXjt</a><br />‚Äî Catch Up (@CatchUpFeed) <a href="https://twitter.com/CatchUpFeed/status/1652604715744763907?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 30, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Then you view her TikTok page which has all of twelve videos. One is a second follow-up, where she claims the government and a pharmaceutical rep is after her. The rest are videos of a hardo trying to launch a career as a TikTok influencer.</p><p>I'm not saying that the world isn't lousy with dystopian government red flags. You saw it <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/justin-trudeau-emergencies-act" target="_blank">with the Freedom Convoy</a> when the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/freedom-convoy-police-facebook" target="_blank">government really did freeze people's bank accounts</a>. As for Australia where I believe these videos were recorded, see: <em><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/top-5-australia" target="_blank">Pandemic, All the Government Actions During The Global</a>.</em></p><p>In the case of Tofana, I think she's a few tacos short of a combination platter. Hashtag like and subscribe.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

<p>I <em>MIGHT</em> be inclined to think this is why <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ted-cruz-merrick-garland" target="_blank">the Joe Biden White House</a> seemed alarmingly vested in <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/school-board-nsba-cardona" target="_blank">having angry parents lumped in with domestic terrorists</a>.
