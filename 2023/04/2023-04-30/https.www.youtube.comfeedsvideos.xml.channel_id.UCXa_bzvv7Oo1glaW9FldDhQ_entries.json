Sure, a story exists. But the game is centered around the action and the journey and less about the details that allegedly brought it all into existence. Characters are often one-note without any significant meaning or depth. Despite, Sunbreak adding a host of new characters, it doesn\u2019t really mean much in the end other than you have some partners to take with you on Follower Collab Quests. Perhaps, a future entry will take us on an emotionally-layered journey with truly embattled characters that are affected by the chaos at hand.\n \nAs an expansion, Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak fulfills its intended purpose. With stunning new locales, a host of fearsome monsters, and a few quality-of-life fixes, Sunbreak should be a welcome addition for long-time fans. But with a lack of innovation on the core gameplay loop and the threat of repetition burnout ever-present, this package is ultimately more of the same.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Nuf7wabq5A", "date_published": "2023-04-30 17:30:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXa_bzvv7Oo1glaW9FldDhQ", "title": "11 NEW Games Of May 2023 To Look Forward To [PS5, Xbox Series X | S, PC]", "description": "The year has already been massive for gaming, with releases like Hogwarts Legacy, Dead Space Remake, and more making their mark.
