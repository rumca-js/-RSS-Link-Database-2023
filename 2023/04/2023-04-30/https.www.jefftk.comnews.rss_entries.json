This\nusually looks like requiring attendees be \"fully vaccinated\", \"up to\ndate\", or \"fully vaccinated and boosted\", and cashes out to the people\nat the door checking for a primary series plus potentially a booster.\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nA bit over a week ago, however, the CDC put out <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2023/s0419-covid-vaccines.html\">updated\nguidance</a>, including:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\nMonovalent (original) mRNA COVID-19 vaccines will no longer be\nrecommended for use in the United States.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nAnd:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\nCDC recommends that everyone ages 6 years and older receive an updated\n(bivalent) mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, regardless of whether they\npreviously completed their (monovalent) primary series.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nThis reads to me that if someone is not yet vaccinated and decides to\nbecome so, they'll be given a single bivalent mRNA dose.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nEvents that require vaccination need to decide how to handle this, and\nit would be good to think about before someone shows up at the dance!\nAt the dance I help organize we <a href=\"https://www.bidadance.org/accessibility\">phrase</a> it as\nrequiring a booster if eligible, but if it's your first shot then it's not\nboosting anything?  And some dances are even more explicit about\nrequiring something you can't get anymore:\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<blockquote> All students, instructors, and staff who attend in-person\nclasses and/or events must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Fully\nvaccinated means that it has been at least two weeks since your second\ndose of Pfizer or Moderna vaccine or first dose of Johnson &amp;\nJohnson vaccine. Starting January 2022, individuals must have received\na COVID-19 booster shot if they received Johnson &amp; Johnson only or if\ntheir 2nd dose of Pfizer or Moderna was more than 6 months ago.\n&#8212;<a href=\"https://bluesunionboston.com/code-of-conduct/\">Blues\nUnion</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n(Not trying to say anything here on whether or when I think events\nshould require vaccination.)\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><i>Comment via: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jefftk/posts/pfbid0wcg1kErR4CRTaRhDvbEw9TBPjAaPEuTqtmfWA4eiGcW2t63eA4tmhfiLwZjvN2nbl\">facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://lesswrong.com/posts/LuDH8ALr4dWczgZmW\">lesswrong</a>, <a href=\"https://mastodon.mit.edu/@jefftk/110288908618563201\">mastodon</a></i></p>", "link": "https://www.jefftk.com/p/vaccine-policies-need-updating", "date_published": "2023-04-30 08:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
