It was not established primarily or directly to improve schools or the system generally. It aimed to provide impartial, independent, professionally subjective judgments to assist leaders, governors and teachers in evaluating their policies and provision so as to help determine priorities for development. It was for schools to consider the inspection findings and commendations, not to necessarily accept them all.</p><p>That original limited but valuable purpose has been forgotten, even corrupted, and overtaken by more grandiose claims. Ofsted is now viewed by its leaders and supporters as providing authoritative, \u201cobjective\u201d, incontestable findings and recommendations that have to be acted on. Its detractors contest these claims as unwarranted and overblown.

He sees Audo, the brothel\u2019s pimp, who bullies and hectors the girls; he grows particularly close to Euterpe, who becomes a second mother to him.

The latest, on Boris Johnson, based on the accounts of more than 200 people who witnessed his catastrophic, clown-car time in office first-hand, is a test not only of Seldon\u2019s method, but also his tone. In previous volumes the author has assumed a base level of gravitas in his subjects, and of structure in their government. Though he employs the same quasi-legal model for his inquiry here, gathering careful evidence, weighing judgments, the story he pieces together is often one of venal mayhem; it frequently reads like a considered constitutional appraisal of rats in a sack.</p><p>There is a telling coincidence in the fact that the first indelible report of Johnson\u2019s behaviour was also the work of a school master.

Johnson\u2019s \u201cend was in his beginning\u201d, he argues. Speaking to me about his book last week, Seldon noted that Hammond \u2013 who had been the \u201cformidable pipe-smoking\u201d head at Tonbridge school when he started out as a teacher \u2013 was a longstanding inspiration, both as an educator and a writer. \u201cTwo things,\u201d he says. \u201cOne is that his report was typically acute and detailed, like a psychiatrist\u2019s analysis.

Across the country, around 12,000 boys aged eight and up are enrolled in these training schemes (boys and girls can start training with clubs from as young as five years old). Professional clubs scout young players and help them develop towards the adult game. Around 3,500 boys are currently signed to Premier League academies, but over 99% of children signed to an academy aged nine won\u2019t have a professional footballing career. \u201cThere were players who were faster and stronger than me who didn\u2019t make it,\u201d Alexander-Arnold tells. \u201cI\u2019m not moaning about it. I\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t deserve it. But I played with hundreds of kids growing up. Against thousands.
