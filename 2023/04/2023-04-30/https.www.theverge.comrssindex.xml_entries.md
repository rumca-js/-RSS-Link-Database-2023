  <p id="gbYO5R">Full-time Twitter CEO and part-time Tesla enthusiast <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1652349875017879552">Elon Musk said</a> on Saturday that users of his social media platform will be able to avoid media subscriptions and pay per article starting “next month.” Musk says that Twitter’s forthcoming “one-click” service “should be a major win-win for both media orgs &amp; the public” by allowing media companies to charge a higher per article price to readers who wouldn’t necessarily pay a full subscription rate. </p>
<p id="XTR13D">Musk didn’t say what percentage Twitter would pocket for itself or what conditions media publishers would need to abide by.</p>

  <p class="p--has-dropcap" id="nUZdqz">Like many great products, the Elgato Stream Deck wasn’t<em> exactly</em> a new idea. </p>
<p id="tllPTL">When the very first one <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/4/17/15327118/elgato-stream-deck-release-amazon">debuted six years ago this month</a>, we instantly compared it to Art Lebedev’s legendary Optimus Maximus keyboard, which promised an array of swirling OLED screens under your fingertips an entire decade earlier. Razer, too, pioneered LCD keys before their time, tacking them onto <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/1/10/2697370/razers-touchscreen-star-wars-the-old-republic-keyboard-hands-on">a keyboard</a> and the company’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/3/2/2821566/razer-blade-review">very first Blade laptop</a>. </p>
<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><div id="FwoZu7"><div></div></div></div>
<p id="t3G1D1">But today, we’re celebrating the simple genius of Elgato — the company that finally turned them into a viable product by making them relatively cheap, comfy, and most importantly: <em>peripheral</em>.    </p>

  <p id="90I6XI">It’s a long-standing belief here at <em>The Verge</em> that copyright law is the only real law on the internet, because it’s the only speech regulation most people on most platforms will accept. (At least in the United States.) </p>
<p id="zR0ZVb">Post something that blatantly infringes someone else’s copyright, and most platforms will spring into action to take it down, because they are protected from liability under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act if they take action in a reasonable amount of time upon request. And the way the DMCA influences user behavior on platforms is really well-known: we have been writing about “no copyright intended” for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/2011/12/9/2624738/remix-culture-copyright-law-doomed">over a decade now</a>. There are lots of and lots of people out there who know how it works.</p>
