Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is another movie generated by the Marvel machine, this time happening to feature Ant-Man. It did quite poorly with audiences and also at the box-office, just like other more recent MCU movies like Eternals, easily the worst out of all Ant-Man movies. The main reason for that being that Quantumania isn't an Ant-Man movie so much as it's a cash-grab designed to service the future of the MCU and their new villain, Kang. In today's Anatomy of a Failure, let's shrink closer into what exactly is Quantumania missing that makes it a cash-grab and how to avoid falling into that same trap with you movie.
