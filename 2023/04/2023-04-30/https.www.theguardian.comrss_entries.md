## Frankie Boyle’s Farewell to the Monarchy review – looks like he’s blown his chance of an OBE

<p>According to the comedian’s hilarious new show, the royals are a crime syndicate we should throw molotov cocktails at – or replace with a constitution. That’s how you tell truth to power!</p><p>‘You’d think Prince Andrew would apologise,” says Frankie Boyle. He’s midway through his timely lament about what he takes to be the misogynistic, thick, inegalitarian non-entities of Britain’s monarchy, shortly before the fatuous institution’s continued existence is solemnised with Charles III’s coronation. “I apologise after <em>consensual</em> sex.”</p><p>And yet, for all the Glaswegian comedian’s republican posturing, there is a queasy sense that if Prince Andrew didn’t exist, Boyle would have to invent him. The Duke of York is the comedy gift that keeps giving. Symbols are important to the royal brand, Boyle tells us. Consider Prince Charles’s crest before he became King. It “shows a lion mounting another lion while a horse looks patiently on. Whereas the Duke of York’s shows a lion paying £12m to a sex-trafficked lion cub the lion claims he never met.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/30/frankie-boyles-farewell-to-the-monarchy-review-looks-like-hes-blown-his-chance-of-an-obe">Continue reading...</a>

Dyche took six points from his opening three games but his record over the past 10 matches reads seven points won, eight goals scored and 20 conceded.

## The Guardian view on poverty in Scotland: a contradictory history | Editorial

<p>The number of Scottish people in deep poverty has grown despite thoughtful welfare reforms. More will be needed</p><p>Social security is an investment in people, yet politicians in England have often treated it as a handout that should be almost impossible to survive on. The Scottish government has taken a different attitude. In place of George Osborne’s two-child limit on benefits, it has established a new<a href="https://www.socialsecurity.gov.scot/news-events/news/184-000-getting-25-scottish-child-payment#:~:text=Scottish%20Child%20Payment%20was%20announced,the%20end%20of%20last%20year." title=""> weekly payment of £25</a> for each child. To mitigate the bedroom tax, it introduced<a href="https://www.gov.scot/policies/private-renting/private-tenancy-reform/" title=""> discretionary housing payments</a>. While the Department for Work and Pensions rolled out huge changes to benefits without consulting those who use them, Scotland commissioned <a href="https://www.gov.scot/collections/social-security-experience-panels-publications/" title="">“experience panels”</a> to involve people in the design of policies.</p><p>Despite these laudable attempts to ease the pain of Westminster’s swingeing cuts, the longer story of poverty in Scotland is one of bleak contradictions. As new research from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) shows, while overall poverty levels have fallen, the number of people in very deep poverty has grown dramatically. Over the past two decades<strong>,</strong> a population <a href="https://www.jrf.org.uk/press/dramatic-increase-very-deep-poverty-sees-nearly-half-million-scots-facing-profound-hardship" title="">the size of Dundee</a> has been pushed into extreme poverty (households with less than 40% of the median income). People in this group are more likely to be single adults, from minority ethnic backgrounds, or disabled. Many of the causes – such as low-paid jobs – are national phenomena. Destitution is <a href="https://www.jrf.org.uk/report/destitution-uk-income-thresholds-october-2022#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20we%20calculated%20that,Destitution%20in%20the%20UK%20study." title="">rising</a> across Britain. But its increase in Scotland should also be a warning about how policies are targeted.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/30/the-guardian-view-on-poverty-in-scotland-a-contradictory-history">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The current process to evaluate schools is not fit for purpose, say readers</p><p>Re your editorial (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/24/the-guardian-view-on-ofsted-inspections-not-fulfilling-their-purpose" title="">The Guardian view on Ofsted inspections: not fulfilling their purpose, 24 April</a>), in 1992, Ofsted was set up by statute to assess the quality of education in each school. It was not established primarily or directly to improve schools or the system generally. It aimed to provide impartial, independent, professionally subjective judgments to assist leaders, governors and teachers in evaluating their policies and provision so as to help determine priorities for development. It was for schools to consider the inspection findings and commendations, not to necessarily accept them all.</p><p>That original limited but valuable purpose has been forgotten, even corrupted, and overtaken by more grandiose claims. Ofsted is now viewed by its leaders and supporters as providing authoritative, “objective”, incontestable findings and recommendations that have to be acted on. Its detractors contest these claims as unwarranted and overblown. Any reform of the system would do well to recognise the value of the limited purposes set out in the original legislation.<br /><strong>Prof Colin Richards</strong><br /><em>Former HM inspector of schools, Spark Bridge, Cumbria</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/apr/30/schools-deserve-better-than-this-ofsted-inspections-regime">Continue reading...</a>

Jota proved the match-winner, stealing in to head in Daizen Maeda’s cross as the Rangers defence stood motionless. Immediately before this, Rangers players had halted in their tracks as Matt O’Riley claimed in vain for a Celtic free-kick. It was a bizarre act of self-harm from those in blue, with Maeda capitalising on hesitation to pinch the ball and cross into Jota’s path.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/30/celtic-rangers-scottish-cup-semi-final-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A fourth-century man finds himself alone and adrift in Britain in the last days of empire in a brutal, wonderful novel</p><p>J<a href="http://www.jameshynes.com/">ames Hynes</a> is not well known in the UK – <em>Sparrow</em> is the 67-year-old American’s sixth novel but his first to be published internationally. It tells the story of a man who calls himself Jacob, writing in a library in Britain some time in the latter half of the fourth century AD. Jacob has been known by many names over the course of his life: Pusus (Little One), Mouse, Antinous. His secret name for himself is Sparrow. To many, he was known as cinaedus – the catamite. Jacob is, perhaps, the last Roman. He is “a weathered piece of driftwood discarded by a receding tide, the sole remaining resident of a deserted town in an abandoned province at the bleeding edge of a dying empire”.</p><p>We first meet Jacob in the town of Carthago Nova in Hispania. He’s initially under the kitchen table in a brothel called Helicon, watching the woman he thinks of as his mother, Focaria, cook and clean. The prostitutes, known as wolves, are named after the muses: Euterpe, Urania, Clio, Thalia and Melpomeni. For the first 50 pages of the book, Jacob doesn’t step outside the kitchen. He sees Audo, the brothel’s pimp, who bullies and hectors the girls; he grows particularly close to Euterpe, who becomes a second mother to him. We learn that Carthago Nova is a centre of the slave trade, and that Jacob himself was purchased in error, thought to be a girl.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/30/sparrow-by-james-hynes-review-the-last-lonely-roman-writes">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ambrice Miller has remodelled a 17th-century former malt house into a comfy family home</p><p>Ambrice Miller is sitting in her dining room on a bobbin chair that she designed. On the wall behind her is a hyper-realistic drawing by <a href="https://ramadhanihamisi.com/" title="">Ramadhan Hamis</a>, an artist she represents. An equine bust and two Persian rugs also fill the space beneath an antique crystal chandelier from Provence, which hangs from one of the ceiling beams.</p><p>This space is actually one of the more understated rooms in her home. “Apparently a collector is just a hoarder, but I’ve also been told it’s not hoarding if what you’re holding on to is beautiful,” says the art dealer and asset manager. The malt house she’s standing in has aged rather gracefully. It has the character you’d expect from a 17th-century property and, while there have been a few nips and tucks here and there, thanks to its good bones, Ambrice and her husband, Ben, who undertook most of the renovation works themselves, didn’t need to do any structural work.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/30/interiors-its-like-a-miniature-downton-a-cosily-grand-home-in-suffolk">Continue reading...</a>

## Should I worry about how much sleep I’m getting?

<p>Late nights, early starts, nightmares, anxiety, children … there are so many things that can cut into our shut-eye. When does that threaten our health – and what can we do about it?</p><p>Of all the things to worry about in life, sleep may be the most pernicious. Most things you either <em>can</em> directly control (your booze intake, Twitter consumption, exercise regime) or you can’t (pollution, bees dying, malevolent artificial intelligence). But sleep sits right in the middle: even if you feel as if you are giving yourself enough, are you really? Is it the right sort? And then, of course, there’s always the worry that the worrying itself is a problem – by stressing yourself out about shut-eye, are you making things worse?</p><p>First, take a deep breath. To start with the basics: if you are getting anywhere from seven to nine hours a night, you’re probably fine. “Some people can get away with as little as six hours a night, or might need as much as 10, but those are generally extreme cases,” says Jason Carter, dean of Baylor University’s Robbins College of Health and Human Sciences. “I would start to get concerned with consistently sleeping less than seven hours a night, and really concerned if it dropped to six or below.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/30/should-i-worry-about-how-much-sleep-im-getting">Continue reading...</a>

<p>(Partisan)<br />The Doncaster genre-hopper has plenty of good ideas but can’t quite marshal them into a compelling whole</p><p>Doncaster experimentalist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/16/skinny-pelembe-one-to-watch-doya-beardmore-no-blacks-no-dogs-no-irish">Skinny Pelembe</a> is precisely the type of act that should thrive in our streaming age, when listeners enjoy genre-hopping more than ever. Brought up imbibing Afrobeat, bossa nova, rock, dub, country, hip-hop and more, he has never shied away from decanting everything he has absorbed into his music. It’s just that, as with his 2019 debut, <em>Dreaming Is Dead Now</em>, he can’t quite marshal his many decent ideas into a compelling whole.</p><p>The singles <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbQKn6hVaHY">Don’t Be Another</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwBeaUKSakg">Like a Heart Won’t Beat</a> are both strong, particularly the latter’s use of piano and rushing percussion, hurrying along to an explosively sudden ending. Elsewhere, moments spark then fail to catch fire. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3pQRP6aEPI">Oh, Silly George</a> pokes you sharply by starting “I think it’s time we emigrate, feel like an intruder/ Hate it here on match day anyway”, then doesn’t develop any further perceptive thoughts on belonging and exclusion. Although Pelembe has recently spoken of having more confidence in his more-than-adequate voice, he often chooses to layer or distort it. Added to his love of wandering instrumental passages, buried choruses and self-sampling, the overall effect can be quite distancing. It feels like there’s better work to come.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/30/skinny-pelembe-hardly-the-same-snake-review-hits-and-misses-dont-be-another-like-a-heart-wont-beat">Continue reading...</a>

<p>You want a middle-aged woman to run an ultramarathon or start a wellness empire? Can’t I just have a breakdown?</p><p>There is good news for midlifers, so gird your loins for a flurry of off-brand optimism. Kicking off the list is a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/23/prize-london-book-fair-over-50s-novel-debut-book" title="">new prize for debut novelists over 50</a>. “The reason we launched the award was to say to people over 50: yes, you too can be a shiny, sparkly, new writer – just older,” said Lisa Highton of Jenny Brown literary agents, who launched the award. I am delighted, because it will add new literary later bloomers to my carefully memorised list: Penelope Fitzgerald (first novel published at 60), Raymond Chandler (51) and Annie Proulx (56). It looks less impressive every year I still don’t write a novel, so new blood is welcome.</p><p>It’s heartening to see more recognition that while life might have stopped you from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/13/granta-reveals-its-pick-of-future-star-british-novelists#:~:text=Granta%20reveals%20its%20pick%20of,British%20novelists%20%7C%20Books%20%7C%20The%20Guardian&amp;amp;text=Writers%20on%20this%20year%E2%80%99s%20Granta,Eleanor%20Catton%20and%20Saba%20Sams" title="">making that cursed Granta Young Novelists list</a>, this might make your writing richer and more exciting – although nothing short of a full transfusion of virgin’s blood in a Swiss clinic could achieve “shiny, sparkly” for me.

<p><strong>Soho theatre, London<br /></strong>This debut from disability-led theatre company FlawBored is not afraid to make us squirm as it skewers virtue signalling and corporate buzzwords<br /></p><p>What starts as an audio-described introduction descends into a darkly comic pisstake. From disability-led theatre company FlawBored, this debut is an ensemble-devised satire of the commodification of people with disabilities, spotlighting the disingenuousness, the careless virtue signalling, and the unhelpful anxiety that frequently crop up in conversations around disabilities. The presentation has an easy-going charm to it, but this company is not afraid to make us squirm.</p><p>Through a series of meta sketches fuelled by corporate buzzwords and over-apologies, our three affable hosts (Samuel Brewer, Aarian Mehrabani and Chloe Palmer) drily mock the commercial mass-marketing of disabled identities. The storytelling is playful with a keen eye for experimentation, complete with interruptions from the captioner and moments where they step out of the show to plead with us not to cancel them on Twitter.</p><p><a href="https://sohotheatre.com/shows/its-a-motherfking-pleasure/">At Soho theatre until 13 May</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/apr/30/its-a-motherfking-pleasure-review-a-darkly-comic-satire-on-disability">Continue reading...</a>

But there’s no scope for the visitors to this park to be able to determine its meaning, which is the true joy of any park. It’s like: this bit’s for sitting, this bit’s for walking and this is for exercising.”</p><p>It sits in opposition to more traditional public parks that are blank canvases, providing a ragged “geography of openness and possibility”. These places invite, say, a pickup football game, a dog let loose, a blanket spread on the ground which can all lead to the kind of human encounters we are increasingly cut off from. But the Olympic Park is a place, he says, that seems to exist mainly for users to be ushered through as swiftly and easily as possible without lingering, except in strictly designated areas. The opportunity for valuable random encounters has been designed out, to our detriment – and it’s something that’s affecting more and more of our public spaces.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/30/why-have-we-stopped-talking-to-strangers-the-joy-of-encounterism">Continue reading...</a>

<p>People turn to handouts and pawning goods as Kyiv’s bustling bars belie reality of life in wartime for many</p><p>In the Treasure pawn shop in Kyiv, Oleksandra, 40, a well turned out woman in a hooded wool coat and Nike trainers, has come to redeem her sewing machines.

<p>I rumbled a chatbot ruse – but as the tech improves, and news outlets begin to adopt it, how easy will it be to spot it next time?</p><p>A couple of weeks ago I tweeted a call-out for freelance journalists to pitch me feature ideas for the science and technology section of <em> </em>the Observer’s New Review. Unsurprisingly, given headlines, fears and interest in LLM (large language model) chatbots such as ChatGPT, many of the suggestions that flooded in focused on artificial intelligence – including a pitch about how it is being employed to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/29/could-ai-save-amazon-rainforest-artificial-intelligence-conservation-deforestation">predict deforestation in the Amazon</a>.</p><p>One submission however, from an engineering student who had posted a couple of articles on Medium, seemed to be riding the artificial intelligence wave with more chutzpah. He offered three feature ideas – pitches on innovative agriculture, data storage and the therapeutic potential of VR. While coherent, the pitches had a bland authority about them, repetitive paragraph structure, and featured upbeat endings, which if you’ve been toying with ChatGPT or reading about Google chatbot Bard’s latest mishaps, are hints of chatbot-generated content.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/30/ai-journalism-is-getting-harder-to-tell-from-the-old-fashioned-human-generated-kind">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Keir Starmer needs to convert poll leads to council clean sweeps to show his party is on the road back to power</p><p>Much of England goes to the polls on Thursday in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/local-elections" title="">local elections</a> that will set the political tone going into the summer. The balance of power ought to be clear: Labour holds double digit poll leads, and is favoured on every issue by voters who report exasperation with the government and eagerness for change. Yet the mood in Westminster is more uncertain – Labour fears, and the Conservatives hope, that the tide can still turn before the general election arrives.</p><p>The task for Rishi Sunak in his first electoral test is clear. The tide is against his party, so he needs to set the bar low and hope disaster is at least averted. It does not help that his party are more exposed than usual with this year’s contests mainly on blue-leaning territory. Yet the Conservatives also have a weaker than usual starting position, thanks to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/03/tories-lose-over-1200-seats-in-local-elections-as-major-parties-suffer" title="">electoral wipeout</a> they suffered in 2019, when nearly all of the seats being contested were last fought. The 2019 contest took place in the dog days of the May government, with Nigel Farage’s Brexit party surging in the polls. It was a disaster for the Tories, with more than 1,300 seats lost, but meltdown then means less exposure now. The Conservatives are defending fewer vulnerable seats and may even recover ground in some quarters. Every defence against the tide and unexpected gain will be seized upon as a sign of resilience.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/apr/30/local-elections-polls-labour-keir-starmer">Continue reading...</a>

But what he learned has shaped his life</p><p>It was all set to be one of the happiest days of my life, 9 September 1989. I was getting married. Everything leading up to the date had gone smoothly. The wedding was taking place in a small church, St Teilo’s in Bishopston Valley on the Gower peninsula. About 130 friends and family had made the trip down to South Wales. After the ceremony, Rachel and I were going to process up the hill from the church to the reception at my in-laws’ home, led by a small jazz band and followed by our guests. But as we left the church, my father suddenly collapsed and died in my arms. He was 65, exactly the age I am now as I write this.</p><p>It’s a moment I remember vividly. A moment that affected what I went on to write about in my career and how I wrote it.

<p>I’ve been accused of making up things for this column. But who’d admit to being so foolish?</p><p>In the nearly five years I’ve been writing this column, I’ve sometimes been accused of making up the more alarming things that have happened to me. This is not the case, as many of my more incident-free columns should sadly prove. ‘Please,’ I say to family and friends, damning myself with every word, ‘if I made stuff up, my column would be a lot more exciting.’</p><p>It’s just that when something unlikely or horrifying does happen to me, I jump at it with both hands. The sad, obvious truth about parenting is that much of it is very boring. The sad, obvious truth about writing about parenting is that ‘much of it is very boring’ will not suffice. Knowing this cannot remedy the fact that there are simply weeks in which nothing of any interest happens to me at all, and I’m forced to tackle things from whatever angle I can. This was a problem when I had one child, who often did very little or, worse, did nothing but the one thing I’d already written an article about some weeks previously. I’ve so far avoided writing a column entitled: ‘Yet more adventures in potty training’, but I could have done for most of 2022. And now I have a daughter, I find she alternates between doing very little and doing things that her brother has already done. All of which means, to paraphrase Vivian Mercier’s famous review of <em>Waiting for Godot</em>, ‘Not only does nothing happen, nothing happens twice.’</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/30/spare-a-thought-for-the-parents-who-take-their-kids-to-school-on-the-wrong-day">Continue reading...</a>

They will spend years living and breathing that choice, and it will almost inevitably be where their younger siblings go.

Distance is a factor; parents often visit to get a feel; and there is a range of public information, from Ofsted inspection reports to pupil attainment data. Is it better to go for a school rated “good” by Ofsted that you can walk to, or is an “outstanding” school worth the daily drive or bus?

<p>The Morning Show star on playing the woman who hid Anne Frank, ​revitalising period dramas and working with her teenage heroes Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon</p><p>Isobel “Bel” Powley, 31, was born in west London. In 2016 she was Bafta-nominated for <em>The Diary of a Teenage Girl</em> and shortlisted for a British independent film award for playing Princess Margaret in <em>A Royal Night Out</em>. Subsequent film roles include <em>The King </em><em>of Staten Island</em> and <em>Mary Shelley</em>, where she met her fiance, actor Douglas Booth. On TV, she’s starred in <em>The Morning Show</em> and Dolly Alderton’s <em>Everything I Know About Love</em>.

I was offered the role on Holocaust Memorial Day, which felt kind of special, but was genuinely like: Who is that? Nor did I know about the occupation of the Netherlands and the Dutch resistance. The first thing I did was get my butt over to Amsterdam. It’s a city that operates in a very specific way – everyone cycles everywhere, it’s built on waterways – so I immersed myself in how it feels to live there. I visited the Anne Frank museum, obviously, but also went to Miep’s old apartment and cycled the same routes as her. That was my springboard for working on this.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/30/actor-bel-powley-small-light-morning-show-friends-interview">Continue reading...</a>

## Anthony Seldon on Boris Johnson: ‘At his heart, he is extraordinarily empty’

<p>The distinguished historian and headteacher discusses his latest book about a contemporary prime minister, a devastating – and dispiriting – account of Johnson’s chaotic reign</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/30/johnson-at-10-anthony-seldon-raymond-newell-review-ducking-and-diving-with-the-pm-who-would-be-king-boris-johnson">Andrew Rawnsley reviews Johnson at 10 by Anthony Seldon and Raymond Newell</a></li></ul><p>Sir Anthony Seldon, the famous headteacher, has been writing book-length report cards on British prime ministers for 40 years. The latest, on Boris Johnson, based on the accounts of more than 200 people who witnessed his catastrophic, clown-car time in office first-hand, is a test not only of Seldon’s method, but also his tone. In previous volumes the author has assumed a base level of gravitas in his subjects, and of structure in their government. Though he employs the same quasi-legal model for his inquiry here, gathering careful evidence, weighing judgments, the story he pieces together is often one of venal mayhem; it frequently reads like a considered constitutional appraisal of rats in a sack.</p><p>There is a telling coincidence in the fact that the first indelible report of Johnson’s behaviour was also the work of a school master. Martin Hammond’s infamous notes on Johnson at Eton, which recorded his “disgracefully cavalier attitude”, his “gross failure of responsibility” and his deep-seated belief that he “should be free of the network of obligation that binds everyone else” is the opening source of Seldon’s account. Johnson’s “end was in his beginning”, he argues. Speaking to me about his book last week, Seldon noted that Hammond – who had been the “formidable pipe-smoking” head at Tonbridge school when he started out as a teacher – was a longstanding inspiration, both as an educator and a writer. “Two things,” he says. “One is that his report was typically acute and detailed, like a psychiatrist’s analysis. And second: just how much the character is formed very early on.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/30/anthony-seldon-boris-johnson-at-10-biography-interview">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Punk rock exploded in 1977 with a raw power seldom seen since. But Johnny Rotten (as he used to call himself) is 67 now, and most of his fans from that time are in their 60s. So what became of all that energy, spiky hair and safety-pins?</p><p>Mark Jordan enjoys walking around his Welsh home town “got up like a Christmas tree” in vintage Vivienne Westwood bondage shirts and bright blue brothel creepers. “The other day, I was stopped by this young guy walking the dog, he was wide-eyed and said, ‘What is that you’re wearing?’” Jordan says. “His eyes were on sticks when I told him that some of this old punk gear is worth thousands.”</p><p>A teen of the late 1970s, punk was Jordan’s escape from growing up on a drab Merseyside council estate through an economic recession. It was a wild time, Jordan, now 61, recalls, though nothing like the handed-down caricatures of punk anarchy today. “It wasn’t all sitting in doorways drinking lager with a dog on a string,” he explains. “Johnny Rotten said, ‘Get off your arse!’ – don’t sit on it. Punk was always more about outrageousness and embracing life.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/30/lust-for-life-the-punks-keeping-the-spirit-of-rebellion-alive">Continue reading...</a>

<p>At 24, Liverpool’s Trent Alexander-Arnold has the world at his feet. But many thousands make the same sacrifices only to be dropped at the last moment – sometimes with tragic consequences. Here, he reveals why he’s working to support ex-academy players</p><p>Trent Alexander-Arnold wants to make clear he has absolutely no regrets about his path to the Premier League. He’s about to recount memories of extreme pressure and major sacrifice. And, really, he’s not complaining. “I’m a success story,” he says, in a soft scouse accent, not boastful. “I look back and I’m proud. I got here through hard work and discipline.” At 24, he has already banked a lifetime of financial and vocational achievements. But he is a rare exception. And for the past few years, that fact has been troubling him.</p><p>Like the vast majority of top-flight professional players in the UK and beyond, Alexander-Arnold came up through a football academy. Across the country, around 12,000 boys aged eight and up are enrolled in these training schemes (boys and girls can start training with clubs from as young as five years old). Professional clubs scout young players and help them develop towards the adult game. Around 3,500 boys are currently signed to Premier League academies, but over 99% of children signed to an academy aged nine won’t have a professional footballing career. “There were players who were faster and stronger than me who didn’t make it,” Alexander-Arnold tells. “I’m not moaning about it. I’m not saying I don’t deserve it. But I played with hundreds of kids growing up. Against thousands. What would have happened if it hadn’t worked out for me?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/30/liverpool-trent-alexander-arnold-on-football-academies-and-the-games-brutal-talent-machine">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In a time before luxury flats and Google offices, the docklands of the Liffey were ruled by tykes on bikes</p><p>In 1985, <a href="http://sydshelton.net/">Syd Shelton</a> recalls, children on bikes still ruled the streets; there weren’t so many cars, and kids didn’t have phones to stare at. He took this picture in Dublin, near the docks. He was in the city preparing a photographic project called Ireland: A Week in the Life of a Nation. Fifty photographers, some famous, such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/sep/12/william-klein-photographer-dies-aged-96">William Klein</a>, were due to arrive to capture the country in pictures. In the meantime, Shelton had some time to wander. He thinks of this picture as a street portrait rather than something entirely spontaneous: “I was using flash and a tripod and the image was very much a conversation between me and the kids.”</p><p>The street with the gasometers was in Ringsend, on the south bank of the Liffey. At the time it was entirely a residential area – some of the houses were built by William Beckett, Samuel’s grandfather, in the 1880s. Many of them have now been demolished. Ringsend is the home of Google’s European HQ, and the gasometer has been redeveloped as luxury apartments. Shelton has another photograph from that afternoon in 1985. “I got the kids on bikes to gather their mates,” he says, “and I took a picture of 40 of them, with the gasometer behind.”</p><p><a href="https://www.atlasgallery.com/exhibition/seen-and-not-heard">Seen Not Heard is at Atlas Gallery, London W1, 19 May-24 June</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/30/the-big-picture-syd-shelton-meets-the-kids-of-pre-gentrification-south-dublin">Continue reading...</a>

Lots of restaurants can smash it on a Saturday. That’s not how you make a living. To make a living, you have to be full on a Wednesday lunchtime. This Wednesday lunchtime, Alexandros is doing trade of which others can only dream. “It was even busier yesterday,” says Aris Pathanoglou, who owns the place with his wife, Sarah, when I comment on the bustle and hum. It’s an older crowd, the sort who can find space on a weekday for a proper lunch, as long as it’s reliable, and yes, we will have a whole bottle, thanks. Alexandros, a venerable Greek restaurant, which has been feeding the good and greedy of Carlisle for more than two decades, is clearly very reliable.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/apr/30/jay-rayner-review-alexandros-carlisle-excellent-greek-family-restaurant">Continue reading...</a>

## The Observer view on generational inequality: the redistribution of wealth requires political nerve | Observer editorial

It’s time for baby boomers to share their spoils with the young, or else trouble lies ahead<p>The promise that living in an affluent society with a healthy economy holds out is that successive generations will enjoy ever-greater opportunities. But in the UK that intergenerational covenant is under threat, thanks to a housing market that means falling numbers of people will own their own home, and an ageing society in which today’s young people will shoulder the burden of higher taxes to meet the health and care costs of their parents’ generation. Sir Keir Starmer is right to focus on this as one of the most important issues a Labour government must address in his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/apr/29/keir-starmer-labour-party-home-ownership-leader-voters">interview</a> with the <em>Observer</em> today.</p><p>So many factors are against today’s young people. First, there are the inherently difficult economics of an ageing society, the product of falling birthrates. Britain will need to spend a higher proportion of GDP on healthcare and pensions as our population of older people increases, with fewer working-age taxpayers to shoulder these costs. And people in their 20s and 30s will not have the same private pension provision as this generation of retired workers, many of whom have benefited from generous defined-benefit schemes long since closed to younger workers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/30/generational-inequality-redistribution-wealth-requires-political-bravery">Continue reading...</a>

## Diane Abbott’s letter was woeful and inflammatory | Letters

A public figure should know better than to deny the existence of anti-Jewish racism<p>Diane Abbott denies that Travellers, Irish and Jewish people ever, at any point in their lives and at any point in history, experience racism (“Racism is black and white”, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2023/apr/23/success-for-women-not-same-as-for-men-letters" title="">Letters</a>). She justifies this by observing that “Jewish people… were not required to sit at the back of the bus”. Maybe not, but Jewish people were rounded up on to trains and transported to death camps – to say nothing of the pubs and hotels whose signs used to read: “No Jews, no Blacks, no Irish.”</p><p>I would be delighted to invite Ms Abbott to my synagogue, where she can meet the security volunteers who keep us safe from antisemitic attacks, and watch us reading from a Torah scroll saved from destruction during the Holocaust. Perhaps, then, she will understand how inappropriate it is for a public figure to make extraordinary and inflammatory remarks such as denying the existence of anti-Jewish racism.<br /><strong>Rabbi Gabriel Kanter-Webber</strong><br />Brighton and Hove Progressive Synagogue<br /></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2023/apr/30/diane-abbott-letter-woeful-inflammatory-letters">Continue reading...</a>

Your husband is breaking promises and not listening to you. You’re hurt and frustrated, and desperate for things to change, but don’t act in haste or rage<p><em><strong>The dilemma </strong>I am 47, have two primary-school children and a marriage that is in slow decline. From our initial pre-marriage ideals of a kind of Scandinavian shared approach to parenting and marriage it became apparent that, in fact, our underlying approach was that of his parents. The expectation is that I do everything. Nothing is done in an abusive way, but there is a passive detachment which I see in him that mirrors his dad. In his side of the family, the women run around doing everything while the men watch TV and discuss the news. I have brought this up numerous times, both in frustration and anger and in calmer, sadder moments. My husband will acknowledge this when I am calmer and will try to be more of an equal partner, but after a short time everything falls back to how it has been.</em></p><p><em>I often think about being single. I am not interested in being with another man, but sometimes I find myself wondering if I would have a more equal relationship with a woman. I don’t want to break up because of our children. I have talked with him about splitting up, but he only laughs. Do I stay married? Or should I get out?</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/30/my-husband-wont-lift-a-finger-to-help-me-should-i-stay-or-go">Continue reading...</a>
