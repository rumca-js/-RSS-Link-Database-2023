It's </span>

<a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/boston-social-dance-covid-requirements">reasonably
common</a> for events like social dances to require vaccination.  This
usually looks like requiring attendees be "fully vaccinated", "up to
date", or "fully vaccinated and boosted", and cashes out to the people
at the door checking for a primary series plus potentially a booster.



<p>

A bit over a week ago, however, the CDC put out <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2023/s0419-covid-vaccines.html">updated
guidance</a>, including:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<blockquote>
Monovalent (original) mRNA COVID-19 vaccines will no longer be
recommended for use in the United States.
</blockquote>



<p>

And:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<blockquote>
CDC recommends that everyone ages 6 years and older receive an updated
(bivalent) mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, regardless of whether they
previously completed their (monovalent) primary series.
</blockquote>



<p>

This reads to me that if someone is not yet vaccinated and decides to
become so, they'll be given a single bivalent mRNA dose.

</p>

<p>

Events that require vaccination need to decide how to handle this, and
it would be good to think about before someone shows up at the dance!
At the dance I help organize we <a href="https://www.bidadance.org/accessibility">phrase</a> it as
requiring a booster if eligible, but if it's your first shot then it's not
boosting anything?  And some dances are even more explicit about
requiring something you can't get anymore:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<blockquote> All students, instructors, and staff who attend in-person
classes and/or events must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Fully
vaccinated means that it has been at least two weeks since your second
dose of Pfizer or Moderna vaccine or first dose of Johnson &amp;
Johnson vaccine. Starting January 2022, individuals must have received
a COVID-19 booster shot if they received Johnson &amp; Johnson only or if
their 2nd dose of Pfizer or Moderna was more than 6 months ago.

(Not trying to say anything here on whether or when I think events
should require vaccination.)
