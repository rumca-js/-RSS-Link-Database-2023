<p>In Sunday’s come-from-behind win over Adelaide, Craig McRae’s team continued to take risks but their success is not all voodoo</p><p>This week’s column was supposed to be about Richmond. It was supposed to be about their truly ghastly game at Marvel Stadium, a ground they hate, against the sort of team they would have rolled over with absolute contempt a few years ago. It was supposed to be a look at time’s assault on champion players, and on champion teams.</p><p>And then Collingwood happened. You’re probably sick of me writing about them. I’m sick of it myself. It’s becoming ridiculous. “Every week is a new adventure,” Craig McRae said a few weeks ago. And every week, they outdo themselves. They’re the team you tune in for. They’re the team you’d pay to watch as a neutral. They’ve won nine of their last dozen games after trailing at three-quarter-time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/may/01/collingwoods-black-and-white-magic-again-finds-a-way-in-latest-miracle-comeback">Continue reading...</a>

## LPO/Rachlin/Mäkelä review – a powerful performance of Shostakovich, Mahler and Larcher

<p><strong>Royal Festival Hall, London</strong><br />Violinist Julian Rachlin delivered a knockout concerto, while 27-year-old Finnish conductor Klaus Mäkelä drove the orchestra hard and fast</p><p>That the violinist <a href="https://www.julianrachlin.com/">Julian Rachlin</a> could follow a knockout concerto performance with an encore as long, demanding and fabulously intense as Ysaÿe’s single-movement Sonata No 3, without skewing the balance of the rest of the concert, gives some indication of how powerful this programme was. This was an extraordinary evening from Rachlin, the <a href="https://lpo.org.uk/">London Philharmonic</a> and <a href="https://klausmakela.com/">Klaus Mäkelä</a>, the 27-year-old Finn already lined up to be the Concertgebouw’s next chief conductor.</p><p>Shostakovich’s Violin Concerto No 1 is a long and gruelling play for a violinist but one that Rachlin seemed visibly to be enjoying even halfway through the finale. His deliberate, careful phrasing at the very beginning set the tone for a performance in which nothing was thrown away, not even in the most frenzied episodes, which Mäkelä drove hard and fast. In the long lines of the final movement Rachlin’s violin continued to sing out even as the orchestral sound swelled behind him; by the end he seemed unvanquishable.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/30/lporachlinmakela-review-royal-festival-hall-london">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Fresh vibrant flavours to welcome the spring into your kitchen</p><p>The words, chalked in upper case on a grey board, greet me from afar: CARLINGFORD OYSTERS. CORNISH MACKEREL. For once, my mind is made up even before I set foot in the shop. I glance at some tempting sea bass and a bag of tiny mussels, shells closed tight, but I go with the recommendation. You learn to trust your local shopkeepers.</p><p>I do almost nothing with the oysters save a tiny squeeze of lemon. They have a briny, slap-you-in-the-face freshness and set us up for a fish supper of grilled mackerel with cider vinegar and paprika, and a plume of grilled spring onions. I sometimes struggle to get mackerel off the bars of the griddle, so decide to cook it with heat from above, under the oven grill. The fillets are turned halfway through, to crisp the skin, something I relish, even if others don’t.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/apr/30/nigel-slater-recipes-grilled-mackerel-with-lemon-spring-onions-and-baked-polenta">Continue reading...</a>

<ul><li>Madison Haley scores twice as Sky Blues claim fourth championship</li><li>Captain Natalie Tobin and Princess Ibini also on scoresheet</li></ul><p>Not even 20 minutes were on the clock in Sunday’s title decider, but the contest already hinted at a Sydney FC procession. Twice within the opening stages, Mackenzie Hawkesby delivered pinpoint corners onto the head of Madison Haley, and twice the American striker made telling contributions; first to send a bullet header into the back of the Western United net and then to keep the ball alive for Natalie Tobin to nod home in her 100th game.</p><p>After being forced to wait 179 minutes for their first goal of the finals series, the 2023 A-League Women premiers were cruising, and thoughts of an anxious wait for another breakthrough washed off them in waves. Any hopes United had of dragging their opponents into a war of attrition and eking out a win with sheer grit and bloody-mindedness were gone. The game was now to be played on Sky Blue terms.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/30/sydney-fc-romp-to-a-league-women-title-with-grand-final-win-over-western-united">Continue reading...</a>
