Ending a video game is always challenging, whether you need to tie up multiple loose ends or pay off hours of the player's time. While many games succeed spectacularly, they also include secret endings that aren't that easy to access (at least, if you don't know how to do so). 

Nevertheless, there's plenty to like, from alternate timelines and callbacks to potential sequel teases.

Though it seemed for a good decade or so that survival horror games were well and truly dead, the genre has enjoyed a resurgence the likes of which we couldn't have imagined even in our wildest dreams these last few years. 

The survival horror genre has entered a new golden age and has seen a string of excellent releases, with many more still to come. With so many great new additions having lifted the genre to higher highs than ever before, we felt it's time to take of stock of where things stand right now and reassess the best of the best it has ever had to offer.

It's just a shame that so much of what Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened is trying to do on the gameplay front doesn't land. Though investigations can be satisfying when they finally come together, almost everything leading up to those moments of culmination and eureka is frequently dragged down by design that is either frustratingly opaque, repetitive, or unpolished. 

When the game does move at a steady pace and lets you enjoy the story, it's well worth experiencing. The problem is that it keeps stumbling over itself, all too often preventing itself from moving at the pace it needs to. If you can put up with those frustrations, Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened otherwise has enough going for it that makes it worth experiencing.
