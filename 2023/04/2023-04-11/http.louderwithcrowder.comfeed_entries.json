My inner childhood Harry Potter fan is weeping. <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/daniel-radcliffe-jk-rowling\" target=\"_blank\">Daniel Radcliffe</a> recently sat down with a group of transgender children for the Trevor Project, a nonprofit focused on suicide prevention among LGBTQ youth. He asked them about their various experiences and why we should \"trust kids to tell us who they are\". </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cStories of self-discovery, genuine allyships and gender euphoria \\u2014 told by trans young people.\\n\\nWe're proud to announce the first episode of Sharing Space, moderated by longtime supporter of The Trevor Project Daniel Radcliffe. Watch the full episode this Friday at 9 AM ET.\\u201d</div> \u2014 The Trevor Project (@The Trevor Project)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TrevorProject/status/1641104277375447041\">1680104724</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cHarry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe promotes child sex changes, says we should \"trust kids to tell us who they are\"\\n\\nhttps://t.co/zIf1rRK3Id\\u201d</div> \u2014 The Post Millennial (@The Post Millennial)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TPostMillennial/status/1645802570320052226\">1681224884</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One of the children said, \"I learned from out of the cradle that I was a boy. I should like blue; I should like sports; I should be manly; I should like superheroes. I just never associated with any of that stuff.\u201d Another child said they got hormones a mere week after deciding they were transgender. Radcliffe responded, \"That's amazing.\" </p><p>Radcliffe also mentioned that adults who are wary of <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/trans-child-indiana-kirin\" target=\"_blank\">transitioning children</a>, while good-intentioned, are \"condescending\". One of the kids lamented age restrictions on gender transitions, complaining, \"I don\u2019t understand why I can\u2019t just decide I\u2019m a girl. It\u2019s just the same thing. There\u2019s no age. You don\u2019t have to be 18 to decide that I am who I am.\u201d</p><p>I know Daniel Radcliffe is a great actor, so he could fool anyone pretty easily. But in this roundtable, he <em>does</em> seem to genuinely care about the kids he's speaking to and want what's best for them. And I think this is true of most people and parents on the \"other\" side. Not all, but most, are trying to help the struggling children in front of them. The problem is they're being lied to and gaslit about the impact of transitioning and what often happens after. </p><p>A Swedish study, which the <a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/gender/commentary/sex-reassignment-doesnt-work-here-the-evidence\" target=\"_blank\">Heritage Foundation</a> dubbed the  \"<a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016885\" target=\"_blank\">most thorough follow-up of sex-reassigned people</a>,\" found the suicide rate of those who had undergone sex-reassignment surgery rose to 20 times that of comparable peers, 10-15 years post-op. But this science is hard to come by and is often drowned out by claims that children will commit suicide if we don't let them transition.  </p><p>Which brings me back to the main point. Most people advocating for this think they are saving children from suicide, depression, etc. But it's simply not true. And the results are devastating. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Lily is a Zoomer college dropout who somehow landed a writing gig here at LwC.com.

As a refresher, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/brian-stelter-farewell\" target=\"_blank\">Stelter was let go</a> from CNN last August. His show \"Reliable Sources\" got the boot as part of a company-wide effort to reduce partisanship. Stelter then got a gig with Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s Shorenstein Center as a Walter Shorenstein Fellow. In this role, he hosted campus lectures on \"democracy\". He also <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/brian-stelter-wef\" target=\"_blank\">hosted a \"disinformation\" panel</a> at the World Economic Forum earlier this year. </p><p>But now, he's joining Vanity Fair as a special correspondent to cover Fox News's trial against Dominion Voting Systems. I, for one, completely forgot Vanity Fair covers mainstream news. I always think they just interview celebrities about their various strange health habits and makeup routines. But as it turns out, they do, and Stelter is joining the party. </p><p>Stelter will write a weekly column and host a verison of Vanity Fair's \"Inside the Hive\" podcast about the case. He provided us some more deets over on the Twitter: <em>\"I can confirm [Oliver Darcy's] news in tonight's Reliable newsletter: \"Brian Stelter is joining Vanity Fair as a special correspondent to cover the Fox News trial.\" It's going to be a busy six-or-so weeks.\" </em></p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cI'll be writing weekly columns about Dominion v. Fox and hosting a special edition of VF's\\u00a0\"Inside the Hive\" podcast, called \"Fox on Trial,\" with new episodes each Thursday until there's a verdict.

I had completely forgotten about this case until right this very moment, and personally, I don't care one bit. I barely even remember the details. I'm not sure how interested other Americans will be either, given that we all have other much more important things to deal with. Like the price of eggs. Or maybe the criminal indictment of the only current Republican Presidential candidate. But perhaps Stelter can snag a few listeners from the masses. Perhaps. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Lily is a Zoomer college dropout who somehow landed a writing gig here at LwC.com.

We should really brand all these stories at this point. It turns out, if your child manages to escape the <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/california-snowstorm-woman\" target=\"_blank\">extreme weather</a> events or <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/california-legalize-child-kidnapping\" target=\"_blank\">state-funded kidnapping</a>, the public schools will transition them. At school. Without telling you. </p><p>Aurora Regino, the mother of an 11-year-old girl in the Chico Unified School District, <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/california-mom-confronts-school-district-11-year-old-changed-genders-knowledge\" target=\"_blank\">explained</a> how her daughter's elementary school did just this. At a recent school board meeting, Regino said the guidance counselor who was working with her daughter kept her in the dark throughout the entire process. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cThank you @JesseBWatters for highlighting Aurora Regino\\u2019s fight against CUSD\\u2019s parental secrecy policy last night!\\u201d</div> \u2014 Center for American Liberty (@Center for American Liberty)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Liberty_Ctr/status/1644810828774797313\">1680988435</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At the time of her daughter's transition, Regino had just been diagnosed with breast cancer and her father, the child's grandfather, passed away. So it was understandably a tumultuous time when Regino's daughter told the school guidance counselor she felt like a boy. But the counselor immediately affirmed her new gender identity and declined to inform her mother. </p><p>\"During one of the meetings, my daughter told the counselor she wanted to tell me about her new identity. They ignored her request and did nothing to support her in letting me know what was going on at school.\" </p><p>This was able to happen because of a \"parental secrecy\" school policy, which extends to children as young as pre-kindergarten all the way through the 12th grade. Even in light of a lawsuit from Regino, the school board voted 3-2 to uphold the policy. Regino is suing the school district for failing to inform her about her daughter's transition. </p><p>On the bright side, she said her daughter is now doing well. It's absolutely insane and incredibly scary that state-funded schools now feel they have the right to make decisions for children without parent's input. This comes straight out of the Marxist Communist playbook - the children belong not to their parents, but to the state. At least in California. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Lily is a Zoomer college dropout who somehow landed a writing gig here at LwC.com.

The reporter seemed to immediately start protesting, so KJP told him several times she \"understands\". She then claimed Biden has stood before reporters \"many times\" and taken their questions because he wanted to hear what they were thinking. I don't know about you, but I cannot recall the \"many times\" KJP is referring to. There have been a few formal <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nbc-news-cuts-away-from-biden-press-conference-as-soon-as-reporters-ask-him-questions\" target=\"_blank\">press conferences</a>, sure - and they almost always seem to provide Biden with a <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-given-list-reporters-post-midterm-press-conference-people-supposed-call\" target=\"_blank\">list of reporters</a> to call on and the questions to be asked. Because democracy. </p><p>This whole interaction made me reflect on the Trump days, and man, those press room spats made for some great television. Who could forget them many spars between him and CNN's Jim Acosta? Now, we just get Biden being shielded from questions by the <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-jill-easter-bunny\" target=\"_blank\">Easter bunny</a>.

Not a ton is known about this young man yet, but he did work at the bank he shot up, Old National Bank in Louisville. He began working there full-time last year, though the status of his job at the time of the shooting is unclear. CNN, citing confidential law enforcement sources, reported he had been notified he would be fired. </p><p>Some sources claim he texted a friend that he was suicidal and wanted to shoot up a bank, but that report is still unconfirmed. He also apparently wore a helmet during basketball games in high school due to the amount of concussions he had suffered. </p><p>Apart from that, internet sleuths found some political posts tied to a Reddit account with the same username the shooter used for Instagram. After posting about it, the account was promptly scrubbed from the internet. One post referred to Tucker Carlson as a \"moron\" for condemning the media landscape of America. Another post featured a comic with a super-jacked character who is asked by another person, \"Wow! How did you get like that?\" The jacked character replies, \"Every time Trump tweets some racist sh*t, I do one push-up.\"</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cThe Louisville Kentucky shooter used the Instagram handle CSturg41.\\n\\nA Reddit user with the same name (u/csturg41) hated Trump, posted to r/ChapoTrapHouse (a banned far-left subreddit), and was generally a shut-in.\\u201d</div> \u2014 Reddit Lies (@Reddit Lies)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reddit_lies/status/1645504550244331520\">1681153831</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><br /></p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cAs expected, Reddit has scrubbed the Louisville Shooter's Reddit account.\\n\\nWas it too inconvenient?\\u201d</div> \u2014 Reddit Lies (@Reddit Lies)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reddit_lies/status/1645520146801328129\">1681157549</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And another post featured an announcement from the beginning of the COVID pandemic, when health officials first asked people to stay home and work remotely. The shooter posted, \"Finally, an excuse to stay in without being a bad person.\" </p><p>None of this proves a motive of course, and I'm not trying to argue the shooter was politically motivated in any way. If anything, it seems like he may have been motivated by something with his career. But we've been told time and again that shooters and domestic terrorism are primarily driven by male, right-wing <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/tiktok-anti-white\" target=\"_blank\">white supremacists</a>.

And a point I think some of Trump's overzealous fans could stand to acknowledge. Because they have a habit of thinking Trump is the only man in America who tells the \"truth\" and \"cares\" about them. As a result, any acknowledgment of Trump being a flawed candidate -- like saying he may not be the strongest person to win the general election, which if you're a single-issue voter is a good single issue to consider -- is treated like heresy. Or disloyalty to Trump. </p><p>The forgotten class and the silent majority will never matter to Trump more than Trump matters to Trump. Trump is a politician.

A woman named Maya Foster was fired for having the wrong opinion.</p><blockquote><em>Maya Forstater, 45, lost her job as a tax expert at the Centre for Global Development in March this year after she was accused of publishing \u201coffensive\u201d tweets questioning government proposals to allow people to self-identify as the opposite sex.<br /></em><br /><em><em>However, in the landmark judgment published yesterday, employment Judge Tayler decided Ms Forstater\u2019s view \u201cis incompatible with human dignity and fundamental rights of others\u201d.<br /></em></em><br /><em><em><em>If Ms Forstater had won the case, it would have legally prevented employers from dismissing staff for expressing the \u201coffensive\u201d view that there are only two biological sexes.</em></em></em><br /></blockquote><p>Rowling sided with Foster and her rights as a woman to hold her own opinions.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">Dress however you please.<br />Call yourself whatever you like.<br />Sleep with any consenting adult who\u2019ll have you. <br />Live your best life in peace and security. <br />But force women out of their jobs for stating that sex is real? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/IStandWithMaya?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#IStandWithMaya</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ThisIsNotADrill?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ThisIsNotADrill</a><br />\u2014 J.K.

That one tweet. owling is persona non-grata amongst her former allies over that one tweet.

She plays soccer too. But the reason you've heard of her is that <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/megan-rapinoe-isn-t-hated-because-she-s-a-woman-but-because-she-s-an-insufferable-blowhard\" target=\"_blank\">she validates progressives' worldview</a>, and woke sports reporters get themselves off on athletes who do so. But while she is very yappy when it comes to things being unfair to HER, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/megan-rapinoe-parents-athlete\" target=\"_blank\">she thinks your daughter needs to suck it up</a>. Hence her opposing the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act of 2023.</p><p>The bill says that when it comes to playing on sports teams in elementary school and college, it will be \"based solely on a person\u2019s reproductive biology and genetics at birth.\" There are people who have political belief that if you were born a boy but say you're a girl, that makes you a girl and you take precedence over girls who were born girls and say they're girls. Where it gets controversial concerning sports is that being born a boy gives you various biological advantages: bone density, testosterone, strength, etc.</p><p>(In theory, these people also have the political belief that a girl who was born a girl but says they're a boy should play on the boy's team. As of this writing, there are no examples of someone who fits that category dominating boys' sports).</p><p>Rapinoe was one of a bunch of female athletes -- who have had the benefit of fair competition -- <a href=\"https://www.athleteally.org/open-letter-hr734/\" target=\"_blank\">who signed an open letter opposing this bill</a>.</p><p>\"If this bill passes, transgender and intersex girls and women throughout the country will be forced to sit on the sidelines, away from their peers and their communities.\"</p><p>Wrong. They can play on the boys' team, as the bill says.</p><p>\"Furthermore, the policing of who can and cannot play school sports will very likely lead to the policing of the bodies of all girls, including cisgender girls.\"</p>\n<p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"cad91\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33444829&amp;width=980\" />\n</p>\n<p>\"This will deter girls from participating in sports and create additional barriers. Denying children access to a place where they can gain significant mental and physical health benefits, and learn lifelong lessons that come from being part of a team and working hard towards your goals does not protect women in sports.\"</p><p>There are elected officials -- <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/girls-school-sports-minnesota\" target=\"_blank\">cisgender, female, progressive, elected officials</a> -- who have said in public settings <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/school-board-pennsylvania-girls-sports\" target=\"_blank\">none of that matters since women won't amount to much in sports anyway</a>.</p><p>The bill ensures ALL children have access to those lifelong lessons that come from being part of a team. It just has to be the team they were born with.</p><p>What is most maddening about Rapinoe and the other female athletes who signed this letter -- opposing laws protecting YOUR daughters' opportunities -- is that had they had to compete against biological males, most of them wouldn't have the opportunities to excel that they have.</p><p>A transgender male would be on the women's soccer team. Megan Rapinoe would just be another TERF complaining about it.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.
