However, Eren isn’t the only member of the “Special Operations Squad” — pick up the Captain Levi and Mikasa Ackerman Outfits available now in the Item Shop.

Omni-Directional Mobility (ODM) Gear can be found from the ground, chests or Scout Regiment Footlockers and allows you to grapple in the air and strike opponents. 

Thunder Spears can be found the same way as ODM Gear but these are arm-launched rockets causing detonation damage to enemies and structures.
