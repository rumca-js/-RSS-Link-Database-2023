## Colin from Accounts review – at last, a female character that’s not a stereotype!

<p>This unfailingly funny, perfectly acted Australian sitcom features a lead that’s neither a hot mess nor a manic pixie dream girl. It’s honest, kind and goes from strength to strength</p><p>It begins, as all great love stories do, with a flash of boob. A 29-year-old medical student, Ashley (Harriet Dyer), is on her way to a safety seminar at the hospital when fortysomething microbrewer Gordon (Patrick Brammall) stops his car to let her cross the road. To thank him – and cheer herself up – she pulls the side of her top down briefly and goes on her way. Until, just behind her, she hears the sound of a distracted Gordon (who we are soon to learn has been single for a unicycle-buying-and-abandoning amount of time) running over an unaccompanied dog.</p><p>Before you know it, they are on the hook for a A$12,000 (£6,400) vet’s bill and Ashley has moved into Gordon’s place to take care of the dog while she looks for a house-share that will allow pets. As meet-cutes go, it’s flawless. Though only two of the eight episodes were available for review, the rest of the series looks set fair to be so, too.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/11/colin-from-accounts-review-at-last-a-female-character-thats-not-a-stereotype">Continue reading...</a>

Gershkovich also faces far more serious charges of espionage. Another US citizen, the former marine <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/08/paul-whelan-russia-brittney-griner-prisoner-swap" title="">Paul Whelan</a>, is serving a 16-year sentence of hard labour on spying charges after he was seized in late 2018; he too has been deemed wrongfully detained.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/11/the-guardian-view-on-russias-hostage-taking-free-evan-gershkovich">Continue reading...</a>

In those three seconds of silence, everything that needed to be said seemingly said, he decided that actually he was going add something after all. It had clearly been on his mind, and now it came out: a reminder that shouldn’t have been needed of everything he and they have won, the enormity of it all.</p><p>Responding to the last question, Ancelotti had been talking about his squad, a group of players who know when to have a laugh and when to get down to work. “For a coach, for me, handling this squad is very simple: the human management is good,” he concluded. To his right, press officer Juan Camilo started to say “<em>muchas gracias</em>” to the gathered journalists only for Ancelotti to leap back in. “Wait,” he interrupted. And then he said it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/11/carlo-ancelotti-real-madrid-quality-chelsea-champions-league">Continue reading...</a>

## Glaring flaws in the idea of excluding trans people from single-sex spaces | Letter

<p><strong>Dr Matti Wenham</strong> argues that forcing trans men into women’s spaces will end up increasing risks women, and wonders how such a policy could be policed</p><p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission’s advice to the minister for women and equalities (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/apr/04/kemi-badenoch-could-rewrite-law-to-allow-trans-exclusion-from-single-sex-spaces" title="">Kemi Badenoch could rewrite law to allow trans exclusion from single-sex spaces, 4 April</a>) appears to avoid addressing the key issue driving recent attention on the rights of trans people: access to single-sex toilets and changing spaces. They appear not to have taken the issue to a logical conclusion, an exercise that reveals two glaring flaws.</p><p>First, if such spaces are to be divided by “biological sex”, this will force trans women into men’s spaces and, more alarmingly, trans men into women’s spaces. The latter will mean that a greater number of more masculine people will be present in women’s spaces, thereby making it easier for cis (or biological) men to infiltrate them. This will increase the risk to women using such facilities, not to mention the increase in risk to trans women using men’s facilities.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/apr/11/glaring-flaws-in-the-idea-of-excluding-trans-people-from-single-sex-spaces">Continue reading...</a>

Composer best known for creating the theme music for the popular and long-running ITV series Poirot<p>The composer Christopher Gunning, who has died aged 78 of renal cancer, operated with equal assurance in both the film and television world and the classical symphonic tradition. The music for which he is most widely known is that for ITV’s long-running series Agatha Christie’s Poirot, starring David Suchet, for which he won a Bafta in 1989 and created incidental music for some 40 of the episodes.</p><p>Gunning recalled that he wrote three candidate melodies for the ubiquitous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRo7tMnM60I" title="">signature tune</a> for the producer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/nov/10/brian-eastman-producer-poirot-tv" title="">Brian Eastman</a> to consider; the third option was picked as best combining the spirit of the late 1920s and 30s with the slightly darker side of the Belgian detective’s character.

She was ranked at No 17, just between Brahms and Haydn. The esteem in which the Finnish composer, now 70, is held helps explain the anticipation around her latest opera, Innocence, as it reaches the Royal Opera House in Simon Stone’s production next week.</p><p>So do the reactions of many of those who saw its premiere at the Aix-en-Provence festival in summer 2021 – and those who performed in it. “I’m absolutely sure that this is one of the most important works of our time,” says <a href="https://susannamalkki.com/" title="https://susannamalkki.com">Susanna Mälkki</a>, who conducted that premiere with the London Symphony Orchestra in the pit, and is in London to conduct the Covent Garden dates. She has lived with the work for three years now, as Covid forced the last-minute postponement of the originally scheduled premiere. That first summer of rehearsals was an intense time, she says – not only because of the pandemic backdrop but also because of the subject matter of the opera.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/11/most-important-works-of-our-time-innocence-kaija-saariaho-school-shooting-opera-roh">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Citizen Lab says victims’ phones infected after being sent a iCloud calendar invitation in a ‘zero-click’ attack</p><p>Security experts have warned about <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2023/04/spyware-vendor-quadream-exploits-victims-customers/">the emergence of previously unknown spyware</a> with hacking capabilities comparable to NSO Group’s Pegasus that has already been used by clients to target journalists, political opposition figures and an employee of an NGO.</p><p>Researchers at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto’s Munk School said the spyware, which is made by an Israeli company called QuaDream, infected some victims’ phones by sending an iCloud calendar invitation to mobile users from operators of the spyware, who are likely to be government clients. Victims were not notified of the calendar invitations because they were sent for events logged in the past, making them invisible to the targets of the hacking. Such attacks are known as “zero-click” because users of the mobile phone do not have to click on any malicious link or take any action in order to be infected.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/11/canadian-security-experts-warn-over-spyware-threat-to-rival-pegasus-citizen-lab">Continue reading...</a>

Its release also marks 20 years since his debut album, Lycanthropy, a collision of viola folk and electronic pop that was as stark a contrast to the scrappy indie of the time as his homemade clothes and ambiguous sexuality were from all those lads in skinny jeans.

<p>Timothy Egan’s new book recounts the mainstreaming of the racist group and its unraveling after one woman’s testimony</p><p>The scene is distinctly American: a Fourth of July celebration amid stalks of corn and creekside parks; men, women and children gathered for a parade accentuated with a painted prop plane, many in conical white hoods. Kokomo, Indiana, was a typical midwestern town in the summer of 1923, when it hosted upwards of 100,000 Klansmen for a “monster” Independence Day rally. Half of its 30,000 residents belonged to the most famous and American of hate groups, including its mayor, prosecutor, its police force and school board.</p><p>That was in line with many other Indiana towns and cities in the early 1920s, when the Klan, as the author Timothy Egan recounts in a startling new book, was brazenly resurgent and mainstream across the country. Membership was somewhere between 2 and 5 million nationwide, and was disproportionately middle-class – doctors, lawyers, teachers, many, many policemen. There were Women of the Klan leagues and Ku Klux Kiddies groups. As Egan notes in <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/558306/a-fever-in-the-heartland-by-timothy-egan/">A Fever in the Heartland: The Ku Klux Klan’s Plot to Take Over America, and the Woman Who Stopped Them</a>, the Klan had, by the early 1920s, 15 US senators under their influence, as well as 75 congressmen, several governors and the mayor of Anaheim, California. The order’s national paper, the Imperial Night-Hawk, had a larger circulation than the New York Times.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/11/kkk-book-american-midwest-fever-in-the-heartland-timothy-egan">Continue reading...</a>

The “zero interest rate policy” (ZIRP) across the western world saw the price of money plummet, letting startups run at a loss for years and giving investors massive appetite for risky bets that might pay off in a big way.

<p>After the disastrous Rise of Skywalker, Lucasfilm’s mighty franchise is on the way back to the big screen, fortified by its TV triumphs in recent years</p><p>It was the announcement we had all been waiting for at <a href="https://www.starwarscelebration.com/en-us/tickets.html">Friday’s Star Wars Celebration</a> – news of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/07/star-wars-three-new-films-lucasfilm-daisy-ridley-rey">the future of the gilded space saga on the big screen</a>. Because it is all very well experiencing every fabulous new episode of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/01/the-mandalorian-series-three-review-disney-plus">The Mandalorian</a> that debuts on Disney+ from the comfort of our own homes; it is wonderful to see Luke Skywalker restored to his lightsaber-wielding prime by the power of motion capture in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/04/the-book-of-boba-fett-wrecked-star-wars-coolest-character-mandalorian">The Book of Boba Fett</a>; and it is fascinating to witness how complex, cosmic political machinations on Coruscant insidiously feed into the bloody-knuckled everyday lives of galactic hoi polloi in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/22/andor-how-a-star-wars-deep-cut-became-one-of-the-best-tv-shows-of-the-year">Andor</a> … but this is Star Wars we are talking about.</p><p>When Yoda reveals under X-wing landing lights that another Jedi hope is still out there; when Darth Vader tells a disbelieving Luke that his parentage isn’t quite as simple as he might have been led to believe; when the Death Star gets blown to smithereens in 1977’s series opener – all these moments draw much of their splendour from the shared experience that comes with seeing a movie at the cinema, rapt in the darkness among hundreds of fellow souls. In many ways, for multiple generations, Star Wars <em>is</em> the movies. So it has been a strange experience watching the saga morph slowly into a small-screen affair after the abject failure of 2019’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/22/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-review-jj-abrams-daisy-ridley-adam-driver">The Rise of Skywalker</a>, even if shows such as The Mandalorian, Andor and the forthcoming <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnzNZ0Mdx4I">Ahsoka</a> (all of which provided genuinely thrilling updates at Celebration) have done much to keep fans happy in the meantime.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/11/star-wars-the-cinematic-empire-prepares-to-strike-back">Continue reading...</a>

There are radical, yet pragmatic, solutions to our crises. But fear of what will happen if we don’t act is imprisoning people in a mindset that makes alternatives seem unthinkable. I am frequently told my solutions are unrealistic and will never happen; that people would rather fight each other in wars than adapt to share food and land, for instance.

Reims did it in 2018-19 but, other than that, the top seven of PSG, Marseille, Monaco, Lille, Rennes, Nice and Lyon have been remarkably consistent for the last half-decade. Lyon’s recent stutters have created an opportunity for a new face to secure a place in Europe.</p><p>Earlier this season, Lorient were turning heads with their attractive play under Régis Le Bris, but they have tailed off lately, undone by the January sales of Dango Ouattara and Terem Moffi. Incredibly, Reims have lost just once in the league under Will Still, but their draw against Brest at the weekend was their ninth of his tenure. Those dropped points are likely to haunt the Champagne side, with sixth place not a European spot this year. Strasbourg came agonisingly close last season, finishing in sixth, but they missed out because Nantes won the Coupe de France.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/11/lens-champions-league-20-years-monaco-marseille">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The award-winning author of Citizen turns her mind to the complexities of balancing art and parenting</p><p>Twenty years ago, the poet, essayist and playwright Claudia Rankine, hailed for <em>Citizen</em> – an original, unnerving and unforgettable scrutiny of racism in the US and winner of the 2015 Forward prize – was involved in a more inward undertaking. She had been reading Virginia Woolf’s <em>To the Lighthouse</em> – and Woolf seems to have become for her, as happens to many readers, a muse of sorts. In the novel, there is a point at which Woolf’s Mrs Ramsay revels in a mind at liberty, “free for the strangest adventures” and observes: “When life sank down for a moment, the range of experience seemed limitless.” Rankine’s own project is about the imagined limits to that freedom. Her narrator is pregnant, uncertain whether to become a mother. Rankine was aware Woolf had decided against having children because of mental instability and her narrator wonders whether a mother and an artist can be expected to coexist. <em>Plot</em> is an arresting curiosity: an embattled, intense, extended prose poem, published in the UK for the first time.</p><p>Rankine, although a mother herself, was not pregnant when she wrote it. If there are autobiographical elements, they are stitched invisibly into narratives from elsewhere. It is a bracing, discomfiting and complicated read partly because it breaks a taboo. It is often oppressively assumed that women will necessarily rejoice at pregnancy but this work involves a complicated dredging of doubt, an examination of the visceral and cerebral burden of pregnancy, a deliberate losing of the “plot” (the word encompassing several meanings).</p><p><em>Plot</em> by Claudia Rankine is published by Penguin (£10.99).

<p>My disability is affecting my sex life and I haven’t slept with anyone in 11 years. Now I’ve met someone I like, but I don’t know how to talk to him about it</p><p><strong>I am 37 and a single disabled </strong><strong>mum to 13-year-old twins. I have not had sex in more than </strong><strong>11 years because I </strong><strong>urinate</strong><strong> when I orgasm</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> I </strong><strong>also don’t</strong><strong> feel attractive because of my scars and limitations. Now I’ve</strong><strong> started dating a man</strong><strong> </strong><strong>who is nine years</strong><strong> my junior and, while he is</strong><strong> a great guy,</strong><strong> I’m scared to</strong><strong> have sex with him. </strong><strong>How can I</strong><strong> talk with him about my concerns so we can embark on the next stage of our relationship?</strong></p><p>Talk to a doctor about your incontinence. There are solutions, and finding one will greatly improve your confidence. I recommend that you approach the subject of your sexual concerns playfully, even seductively. Try to use humour, and keep in mind that when there is strong mutual sexual desire, most limitations can be accommodated. You are the one who knows what your sexual needs are and exactly how to achieve them, and it is important to share that with him once you feel that acting on your attraction for each other is likely or inevitable. Do not expect him to read your mind. He will probably need very specific guidance and, if he is a caring person, he will be grateful for the information and eager to comply. Don’t forget to reciprocate by inquiring about his specific sexual needs and doing your best to meet them.</p><p>Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</p><p>If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to <a href="mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com">private.lives@theguardian.com</a> (please don’t send attachments).

## Grief, hallucinations and exhumed violins: the astonishing music of Richard Skelton

<p>He’s self-released more than 60 searing albums – some with only a single copy – made with instruments including his late wife’s jewellery. On a drive through northern moorlands, he explains his singular sonic world</p><p>‘It’s not a landscape that’s there for people to go and look at,” says Richard Skelton. The countryside around the Anglo-Scottish border doesn’t share its secrets willingly, but a few hours spent in the passenger seat of Skelton’s MG hatchback reveals some of its strange charms. Wide, arrow-straight roads are a mesmerising constant that switches one’s focus to the granular details – the textures of the road surface, the ditches flanking each side, and the occasional cartoonish tree. The effect is hypnotic. “It’s kind of maze-like, and you don’t know where you are half of the time,” Skelton says. “I feel like I could drive around here for decades and not really get the measure of it.”</p><p>Skelton is one of the UK’s most prolific and consistently impressive experimental musicians, the creator of slow-moving yet unexpectedly gruelling drone-based music, and his work often communes with landscapes like these. He’s seen plenty of them at the mercy of the rural renting market. The Lancashire-born musician and his wife, the poet and publisher Autumn Richardson, have lived in Cumbria, Fife, Ireland, and now Liddesdale, just over the border into Scotland. After six years there, they’re preparing for another move, but not before Skelton ends this chapter with Selenodesy, a drone album of yearning swells and searing intensity, motivated in part by the region’s dark skies.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/11/experimental-musician-richard-skelton">Continue reading...</a>

## A month after she died, Mystic Meg is still promising readers they will find love – even my husband  | Zoe Williams

<p>I don’t believe in horoscopes, but the Sun’s astrologer continues to give me and Mr Z something to talk about</p><p></p><p>For as long as we’ve been married, Mr Z has started the day the same way. He says: “Do you want to know what’s in your future?” and I say: “No, I’m done with your bullshit,” and he goes ahead and reads me Mystic Meg anyway. I’m never completely listening, so I lose track of which of us will find love in a red car and which can look forward to choppy waters in the workplace calming as the moon comes into our professional zone. It bugs me because obviously I don’t believe in horoscopes, yet at the same time I am disappointed whenever they don’t come true. Also I can never remember exactly what I have been waiting for – only that it hasn’t happened for me.</p><p>Then, a month ago, Mystic Meg died. Genuinely sad news, because even while knowing almost nothing about her, I had decided that she was probably nice. She kept racehorses and gave them names such as Astroangel and Astrodonna. I admired her total commitment to the world of the unknowable outcome. It is a paradox of the vocation that when you devote your life to predicting the future and are never once held accountable when your certainties fail to materialise, it gives you quite a pleasant que sera, sera attitude.

## God’s Petting You review – addiction’s a lark in shallow crime caper

<p>It’s hard to root for the two feckless young lovers thumbing their noses at therapy, whose trouble with sex and drugs is portrayed as hedonistic fun</p><p>This mostly unamusing British comedy sets off with a framing device that sees heroin addict Charlie (George Webster) explaining recent events in his life to a rapt therapist (Alice Lowe). Clever-clogs viewers might assume that this is the setup for some unreliable-narrator shenanigans and a twist or two at the end, and you’d be right. But the twist – more of an ugly snarl – is unearned by the setup, and feels like the product of lazy screenwriting, devoid of psychological insight. That sort of fits the cheerful, jejune amorality of this film, which treats addiction as if it’s all a bit of a lark and that the therapeutic community – like the woman who runs Charlie’s self-help group – is way too judgmental, man.</p><p>Charlie, you see, is one of the movie heroin addicts: lovely dewy skin and nice hair, just a bit of a rebel and a clown. He only attends group therapy so he can meet his dealer (Joe Wilkinson), who is disloyally moving to Winchester – a change of situation that Charlie sees only in terms of how inconvenient that will be for him. (At least that’s credible junkie behaviour.) Then, one week, in walks a beautiful woman with a fancy insect tattoo on her chest (Skye Lourie) who never gets a name in the film. It turns out this is an all-purpose addiction meeting because “tattoo girl” (as she’s called in the end credits) is a sex addict, and soon enough she and Charlie are knocking boots.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/11/gods-petting-you-review-addiction-comedy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An elegant translation of the South Korean writer’s 2011 novel explores how a teacher losing his sight and a pupil losing her voice form a poetic bond</p><p>G<em>reek Lessons </em>is an extraordinary and dense novel that offers up new depths on each reading. It is short – 160 pages – which means you can read and reread it in a day if you want to. I have a soft spot for short novels – their intensity, their skill in delivering something sharp and true in a few breaths – but the bias is irrelevant because it does what all good novels do: it invites the reader into a world that reaches well beyond the confines of its pages.</p><p>Two characters – one male, one female – take turns to narrate scenes from their lives (the man in first person and the woman in third person). The woman is bereaved of her mother and processing the loss of her son to the custody of her ex-husband and is also experiencing the loss of her ability to speak; the man, similarly, is processing losing his connection to place and family, as well as the loss of his eyesight (an hereditary condition that will eventually blind him). The woman begins to attend lessons in ancient Greek taught at a private academy by the man (neither of them is named) and their meandering relationship begins to evolve.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/11/greek-lessons-by-han-kang-review-loss-forges-an-intimate-connection">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When Turcich was 17, a close friend of his died, and he had an existential crisis. He decided it was time to seize the day – and to cross the globe on foot</p><p>At the age of 17, Tom Turcich had enjoyed a good life so far. He had wonderful parents, great friends, did well at school and was a gifted sportsman. But two things gnawed away at him: he thought he was too timid, and he was terrified of death. As a little boy, he would run down the stairs at night to check that his parents were still alive. At the age of 11, he’d lie in bed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jul/25/death-anxiety-body-bags-catastrophic-thinking-and-facing-the-inevitable">trying to simulate death</a> so he could prepare for it. “I’d lose the sensation of my body,” he says, “and I would cover my ears and close my eyes so I couldn’t see and couldn’t hear, and I’d try to imagine what death was like. But then you can’t because you’re thinking. And there’s no thinking in death.”</p><p>Then, in 2006, his life was turned on its head. Turcich remembers every detail. He was in a car with three friends – Nick, Kevin and Fitz. Kevin was driving his father’s convertible. Back then, the boys used to hang out with a group of girls who were in the year below at school in Haddon Township, New Jersey. There was Shannon who was going out with Kevin, Ann Marie, Amanda and Jess. They’d grown up together, been friends since they were seven or eight, and they were as close as close can be.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/11/the-man-who-walked-around-the-world-tom-turcich-seven-year-search-meaning-of-life">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As a teenager ‘kit anxiety’ nearly made me quit. The England Lionesses switch from white shorts to blue is a step forward</p><p>• Catherine Spencer is a rugby commentator and former England captain</p><p>In my late 20s and early 30s, I was captain of the England rugby team. But as a teenager, gym knickers and leotards nearly put me off sport and exercise for good. I left school over 25 years ago now, but I can still clearly recall how awkward I felt walking across the school playing fields on my own in a pair of extremely unflattering navy blue pants, past groups of girls huddled together and laughing – I was sure – at my tree trunk legs.</p><p>At that stage, a discus was the only thing guarding my embarrassment. I was 14, and I had been persuaded to practise on my own at lunchtimes in preparation for the district games. I completely flopped at the games – standing alone, at the centre of the discus throw circle, feeling like everyone was staring at me, and feeling as though I was hardly dressed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/11/women-sports-kits-period-anxiety-shorts">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This three-plus-hour tale of Oedipal misery sees Phoenix on uncharacteristically boring form and ultimately collapses into silliness</p><p>Having given us two classic scary movies with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/01/hereditary-review-horror-toni-collette-brilliant-fear">Hereditary</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/03/midsommar-review-ari-aster-florence-pugh">Midsommar</a>, film-maker Ari Aster now unfortunately beckons us down the rabbit hole for a giant and epically pointless odyssey of hipster non-horror. Running at over three hours, Beau Is Afraid is a colossal recovered memory of mock Oedipal agony which is scary, boring and sad in approximate proportions of 1 to 4 to 2. It’s a movie in which Aster has surrendered some of his own originality and distinction for an indulgent, derivative flourish that seems to pastiche Charlie Kaufman or Darren Aronofsky’s crazy <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/05/mother-review-jennifer-lawrence-horror-darren-aronofsky-javier-bardem">Mother! </a>or maybe even Richard Kelly’s much controverted <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/dec/07/drama.justintimberlake">Southland Tales</a>.</p><p>Joaquin Phoenix is on really uninteresting form, playing to his weaknesses as an actor as he gives a narcissistic performance of pain, sporting a permanently zonked expression of anxiety and torpid self-pity at the misery that surrounds him. He plays Beau, a middle-aged man now living in squalor and stricken with depression, regularly seeing a therapist (Stephen McKinley Henderson) for anxiety and taking meds. These tend to undermine the surreal grimness of his urban surroundings; is he just hallucinating? The pure oddness of this alt-reality urban dystopia, though very striking in its way, slightly brings into question how seriously we are supposed to take it all in the first place.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/11/beau-is-afraid-review-joaquin-phoenix-ari-aster">Continue reading...</a>
