The \u201czero interest rate policy\u201d (ZIRP) across the western world saw the price of money plummet, letting startups run at a loss for years and giving investors massive appetite for risky bets that might pay off in a big way. At the same time, the \u201czero marginal cost\u201d of the software industry gave outsized returns to effort, allowing for situations like WhatsApp: 55 employees serving 420 million users and selling to Facebook for $19bn.</p><p>But both those conditions are coming to an end. Governments around the world have raised interest rates in a desperate attempt to keep post-pandemic inflation under control, while the rise of AI technologies threatens the production model that brought the sector to its current dominance.

She had been reading Virginia Woolf\u2019s <em>To the Lighthouse</em> \u2013 and Woolf seems to have become for her, as happens to many readers, a muse of sorts. In the novel, there is a point at which Woolf\u2019s Mrs Ramsay revels in a mind at liberty, \u201cfree for the strangest adventures\u201d and observes: \u201cWhen life sank down for a moment, the range of experience seemed limitless.\u201d Rankine\u2019s own project is about the imagined limits to that freedom. Her narrator is pregnant, uncertain whether to become a mother. Rankine was aware Woolf had decided against having children because of mental instability and her narrator wonders whether a mother and an artist can be expected to coexist. <em>Plot</em> is an arresting curiosity: an embattled, intense, extended prose poem, published in the UK for the first time.</p><p>Rankine, although a mother herself, was not pregnant when she wrote it. If there are autobiographical elements, they are stitched invisibly into narratives from elsewhere. It is a bracing, discomfiting and complicated read partly because it breaks a taboo. It is often oppressively assumed that women will necessarily rejoice at pregnancy but this work involves a complicated dredging of doubt, an examination of the visceral and cerebral burden of pregnancy, a deliberate losing of the \u201cplot\u201d (the word encompassing several meanings).</p><p><em>Plot</em> by Claudia Rankine is published by Penguin (\u00a310.99).

Try to use humour, and keep in mind that when there is strong mutual sexual desire, most limitations can be accommodated. You are the one who knows what your sexual needs are and exactly how to achieve them, and it is important to share that with him once you feel that acting on your attraction for each other is likely or inevitable. Do not expect him to read your mind. He will probably need very specific guidance and, if he is a caring person, he will be grateful for the information and eager to comply.

These tend to undermine the surreal grimness of his urban surroundings; is he just hallucinating? The pure oddness of this alt-reality urban dystopia, though very striking in its way, slightly brings into question how seriously we are supposed to take it all in the first place.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/11/beau-is-afraid-review-joaquin-phoenix-ari-aster\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/11/beau-is-afraid-review-joaquin-phoenix-ari-aster", "date_published": "2023-04-11 02:00:36+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "The \u2018nice, ordinary\u2019 family suspected of being deep-state Russian spies - podcast", "description": "<p>When a couple and their children moved into a sleepy suburb of Slovenia\u2019s capital, their neighbours thought they seemed very normal.
