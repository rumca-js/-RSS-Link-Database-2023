According to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-twitter-investment-generative-ai-project-2023-4?op=1\"><em>Business Insider</em></a>, Elon Musk recently bought 100,000 GPUs for use at one of the company\u2019s two remaining data centers. A source told the outlet the purchase shows Musk is \u201ccommitted\u201d to the effort, particularly given the fact there would be little reason for Twitter to spend so much money on datacenter-grade GPUs if it didn\u2019t plan to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-ampere-a100-gpu-specs-analysis-upscaled-130049114.html\">use them for AI work</a>.</p><p>The project reportedly involves the creation of a generative AI that the company would train on its own massive trove of data. It\u2019s unclear how Twitter would utilize the technology. <em>Insider</em> suggests a generative AI could augment the platform\u2019s search functionality or assist the company in rebuilding its advertising business. In any case, the report colors Musk\u2019s recent decision to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tech-leaders-and-ai-experts-demand-a-six-month-pause-on-out-of-control-ai-experiments-114553864.html\">sign an open letter</a> calling for a six-month pause on AI development.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Musk has been a vocal critic of OpenAI, the artificial intelligence research organization he <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2015-12-11-elon-musk-backs-future-ai-initiative.html\">co-founded in 2015</a>. \u201cI\u2019m still confused as to how a non-profit to which I donated ~$100M somehow became a $30B market cap for-profit. If this is legal, why doesn\u2019t everyone do it?\u201d Musk <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1636047019893481474?s=20\">said</a> in one of his recent Twitter missives against the lab\u2019s for-profit subsidiary, OpenAI Limited Partnership.</p><p>However, a recent report from <a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/03/24/2023/the-secret-history-of-elon-musk-sam-altman-and-openai\"><em>Semafor</em></a> suggests his feud with OpenAI is more personal. In 2018, Musk reportedly told Sam Altman, one his fellow co-founders at OpenAI, the lab was falling too far behind Google. Musk then suggested that he should be the one to run the firm, a proposal Altman and OpenAI\u2019s other founders rejected.</p><p>The power struggle led to Musk\u2019s departure from OpenAI, though publicly both parties maintain Musk left due to a conflict of interest involving Tesla. At the time, OpenAI <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/openai-supporters\">said</a> the billionaire would continue to fund its research. However, according to <em>Semafor</em>, Musk\u2019s payments stopped after his departure \u2013 despite a promise to provide the firm with roughly $1 billion. The sudden shortfall left OpenAI scrambling to raise cash. In 2019, the organization announced it was creating a for-profit subsidiary to secure the capital it needed to fund its work. That same year, the firm <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-22-microsoft-invests-openai-azure-supercomputing.html\">announced a $1 billion investment from Microsoft</a>. When OpenAI opened ChatGPT to the public in November and the chatbot began to dominate headlines, Musk was reportedly \u201cfurious.\u201d One month later, he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1599291104687374338?s=20\">cut OpenAI\u2019s access</a> to Twitter\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-elon-musk-data-request-report-181156276.html\">\u201cfirehose\u201d of data</a>.

And now the company is adding three more units to the lineup: the Del-Verb Ambience Companion, Galaxy \u201874 Tape Echo &amp; Reverb and Max Dual Preamp &amp; Compressor.</p><p>These $349 pedals aim to capture the sound of several classic effects with powerful digital emulation. The form factor is the same as the rest of the UAFX pedals \u2014 so you get two foot switches, six knobs and stereo ins and outs, enclosed in a beefy aluminum enclosure. The only immediate difference between the new members of the family and the original six is the price. Universal Audio is one of the few companies actually lowering prices. The company says some minor changes were made to the knobs and packaging, and that the feature set is actually slightly simpler than past pedals, which allowed it to shave $50 off the price.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The Del-Verb Ambience Companion combines delay and reverb into a single pedal. One half of the pedal lets you pick between a spring reverb modeled on a &quot;60s American guitar amp&quot; (presumably a Fender Deluxe), a vintage German plate reverb or a late 70s digital reverb. The other side houses a tape echo emulation, an analog bucket brigade delay (BBM) and clean digital delay.</p><p>Galaxy on the other hand, goes all in on specifically modeling the Roland Space Echo. That includes its much loved preamp and spring reverb effect. There's even a tape age parameter for dialing in just the right amount of lo-fi grit. UA claims it's &quot;the most authentic emulation of the classic mid-'70s Roland Space Echo hardware&quot;, but I'm sure Roland would <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/boss-re-202-re-2-space-delay-141917055.html\">beg to disagree</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly the Max combines emulations of several iconic compressors with a recreation of Universal Audio's own 610 preamp.

Multiple compression algorithms can even be stacked with the UA preamp to get some truly wild tones and textures.&nbsp;</p><p>It has no effect on the sound quality, but these are also probably the best looking of the UAFX pedals yet. The combo of baby blue and rich brown on the Del-Verb is delightful, and the single bright-red knob plus deep blue inset on the Max has a lovely vintage charm.

The company is <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/04/reduce-uninstalls-for-your-app-with-auto-archive.html\">rolling out</a> an auto-archive feature that removes key parts of apps without erasing personal data. So long as an app is still available on the Play Store, you just have to tap its icon to re-download the missing pieces. This can free as much as 60 percent of an app's space, Google says.</p><p>You'll get the auto-archive option if you try to install an app when your device doesn't have enough remaining storage. If you want to look for unused apps, you can visit the Apps section of settings. The software will typically say that it hasn't been opened for more than a few months. Developers have to publish their apps using the App Bundle format for the feature to work, but that shouldn't be an issue as it's been required since 2021.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The concept isn't new. Apple has offered custom recommendations to pull unused apps since iOS 11's release in 2017. However, the addition may be particularly helpful on Android, which powers a wider range of phones, including low-end models. You may not feel as much pressure to upgrade a budget handset if you know you can simply archive apps until you're ready to use them.</p><p>Google adds that this could help developers. If users can auto-archive apps, they're less likely to completely uninstall those apps. Creators may be more likely to hold on to users, even if those customers seldomly return.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/android-can-automatically-archive-apps-you-arent-using-150337942.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/android-can-automatically-archive-apps-you-arent-using-150337942.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-11 15:03:37+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "Sony will stop updating \u2018Dreams\u2019 later this year", "description": "<p>Sony-owned Media Molecule has <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/23678503/dreams-end-of-live-service-server-changes\"><ins>revealed</ins></a> it will stop active development of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/dreams/\"><em><ins>Dreams</ins></em></a> later this year.

There are projections on the dashboard, light animations on the nose and a variety of &quot;experience modes&quot; meant to liven up your commute. We wouldn't expect many of these ideas to reach production Minis, but the more angular body, recycled plastic interior and emphasis on tech may translate to the upcoming lineup.

The once-niche way to protect your online behavior took off, in part, due to massive marketing budgets and influencer collaborations convincing consumers they can solve all your security woes. But deciding the best option for your browsing needs requires digging through claims of attributes that aren\u2019t always totally accurate. That has made it harder to figure out which one to subscribe to, or if you really need to use one at all. We tested out nine of the best VPNs available now to help you choose the best one for your needs.</p><h2>What you should know about VPNs</h2><p>VPNs are not a one-size-fits-all security solution. Instead, they\u2019re just one part of keeping your data private and secure. Roya Ensafi, assistant professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Michigan, told Engadget that VPNs don\u2019t protect against common threats like phishing attacks, nor do they protect your data from being stolen. But they do come in handy when you\u2019re connecting to an untrusted network somewhere public because they tunnel and encrypt your traffic to the next hop.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>In other words, VPNs mask the identity of your computer on the network and create an encrypted \"tunnel\" that prevents your internet service provider from accessing data about your browsing history. Even then, much of the data or information is stored with the VPN provider instead of your ISP, which means that using a poorly designed or unprotected network can still undermine your security.</p><p>That means sweeping claims that seem promising, like military-grade encryption or total digital invisibility, may not be totally accurate. Instead, Yael Grauer, program manager of Consumer Reports\u2019 online security guide, recommends looking for security features like open-source software with reproducible builds, up-to-date support for industry-standard protocols like WireGuard, IPsec or PPTP and the ability to defend against attack vectors like brute force.</p><h2>Who are VPNs really for?</h2><p>Before considering a VPN, make sure your online security is up to date in other ways. That means complex passwords, multifactor authentication methods and locking down your data sharing preferences. Even then, you probably don\u2019t need to be using a VPN all the time.</p><p>\u201cIf you're just worried about somebody sitting there passively and looking at your data then a VPN is great,\u201d Jed Crandall, an associate professor at Arizona State University, told Engadget.</p><p>If you use public WiFi a lot, like while working at a coffee shop, then VPNs can help keep your information private. They\u2019re also helpful for hiding information from other people on your ISP if you don\u2019t want members of your household to know what you\u2019re up to online.</p><p>Geoblocking has also become a popular use case as it helps you reach services in other parts of the world. For example, you can access shows that are only available on Netflix in other countries, or play online games with people located all over the globe.</p><h2>Are VPNs worth it?</h2><p>Whether or not VPNs are worth it depends how often you could use it for the above use cases. If you travel a lot and rely on public WiFi, are looking to browse outside of your home country or want to keep your traffic hidden from your ISP, then investing in a VPN will be useful. But, keep in mind that VPNs often slow down your internet speed, so they may not be ideal all the time.</p><p>We recommend not relying on a VPN as your main cybersecurity tool. It can provide a false sense of security, leaving you vulnerable to attack. Plus, if you choose just any VPN, it may not be as secure as just relying on your ISP. That\u2019s because the VPN could be based in a country with weaker data privacy regulation, obligated to hand information over to law enforcement or linked to weak user data protection policies.</p><p>For users working in professions like activism or journalism that want to really strengthen their internet security, options like the Tor browser may be a worthwhile alternative, according to Crandall. Tor is free, and while it's less user-friendly, it\u2019s built for anonymity and privacy.</p><h2>How we tested</h2><p>To test the security specs of different VPNs, we relied on pre-existing academic work through <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/vpn-services/mullvad-ivpn-mozilla-vpn-top-consumer-reports-vpn-testing-a9588707317/\">Consumer Reports</a>, <a href=\"https://vpnalyzer.org/\">VPNalyzer</a> and other sources. We referenced privacy policies, transparency reports and security audits made available to the public. We also considered past security incidents like data breaches.</p><p>We looked at price, usage limits, effects on internet speed, possible use cases, ease of use and additional \u201cextra\u201d features for different VPN providers. The VPNs were tested across an iPhone, Google Pixel and Mac device so we could see the state of the apps across various platforms. We used the \u201cquick connect\u201d feature on the VPNs to connect to the \u201cfastest\u201d provider available when testing internet speed, access to IP address data and DNS and WebRTC leaks or when a fault in the encrypted tunnel reveals requests to an ISP.</p><p>Otherwise, we conducted a test of geoblocking content by accessing Canada-exclusive Netflix releases, a streaming test by watching a news livestream on YouTube via a Hong Kong-based VPN and a gaming test by playing on servers in the United Kingdom. By performing these tests at the same time, it also allowed us to test claims about simultaneous device use.</p><h3>VPNs we tested:</h3><ul><li><p><a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\"

stood out as a strong option because of its overall security and ease of use. The Proton Technologies suite of services includes mail, calendar, drive and a VPN known for its end-to-end encryption. This makes it a strong contender for overall security, but its VPN specifically came across as a well-rounded independent service.</p><p>ProtonVPN\u2019s no-logs security policy has passed audits, and the company has proven not to comply with law enforcement requests. Because it is based in Switzerland, there are no forced logging obligations, according to the company. Plus, it\u2019s based on an open-source framework, and has an official vulnerability disclosure program along with clear definitions on what it does with personal information.</p><p>While ProtonVPN offers a free version, it\u2019s limited compared to other options with access to servers in just three countries. Its paid version, starting at about $5.39 per month, includes access to servers in more than 65 countries on 10 devices at a time. For dedicated Proton Technologies users, they can pay closer to $8.63 each month for access to the entire suite.</p><p>ProtonVPN passed our geoblock, streaming and gaming tests with only a very small toll on internet speed. It also comes with malware-, ad- and tracker-blocking as an additional service. It\u2019s available on most major operating systems, routers, TV services and more including Firefox, Linux and Android TV.</p><h2>Best free VPN: Windscribe</h2><p></p><p>By signing up for <a href=\"https://windscribe.com/\">Windscribe</a> with your email, users can access 10GB per month of data, unlimited connections and access to more than 10 countries. We selected it as the best free VPN because of its high security and wide range of server options compared to other free VPNs. It has over 500 servers in over 60 countries, according to the company, and can be configured to routers, smart TVs and more on top of the usual operating systems.</p><p>Windscribe doesn\u2019t have a recent independent security audit, but it does publish <a href=\"https://windscribe.com/transparency\">a transparency report</a> showing that it has complied with zero requests for its data, runs a vulnerability disclosure program encouraging researchers to report flaws and offers multiple protocols for users to connect with.</p><p>On top of that, it\u2019s easy to use. The set up is intuitive and it passed our geoblock, streaming and gaming tests. The paid version costs $5.75 to $9 each month, depending on the plan you choose, and includes unlimited data, access to all servers and an ad/tracker/malware blocker. Or, for $1 per location per month, users can build a plan tailored to the VPNs they want to access.</p><h2>Best for frequent travel, gaming and streaming: ExpressVPN</h2><p></p><p>We picked the best VPN for travel, gaming and streaming based on which one had access to the most locations with high speed connections and no lag. <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4255ebf1-6185-403e-9be2-91ab47ad1ac3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=ExpressVPN&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0MjU1ZWJmMS02MTg1LTQwM2UtOWJlMi05MWFiNDdhZDFhYzMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXhwcmVzc3Zwbi5jb20vIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhZDkxNTA4Yi1iYmUxLTQ0ZTgtYTcxNi0wMjcyNGNiY2EzYWMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfTSiO2r428NJBCpZe3eLV5R1owvIj5yByLJP3rxwv1h&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.expressvpn.com%2F\">ExpressVPN</a> met all those criteria.</p><p>An internet speed test measured faster upload and download speed compared to using no VPN, practically unheard of compared to the other VPNs tested. But this is likely a fluke due to the VPN service circumventing traffic shaping by the ISP or another disparity because <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/how-vpn-services-affect-internet-speed\">even top VPNs will in some way slow down speeds</a>.

Subscription costs range from $8.32 to $12.95 per month depending on the term of the plan, and include a password manager.</p><p>With ExpressVPN, users can connect to up to five devices at once, which is on the lower side compared to other services. That said, it works on a bunch of devices from smart TVs to game consoles unlike some other services that lack support beyond the usual suspects like smartphones and laptops.</p><h2>Best cross-platform accessibility: CyberGhost</h2><p></p><p>Because several VPN services connect to routers, cross-platform accessibility isn\u2019t always necessary. By connecting a VPN to your home router, you can actually connect to however many devices you have in your household, as long as they all access the internet through that router.</p><p>But if you use VPNs on the go, and across several devices, being able to connect to a wide range of platforms will be indispensable. <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9fd99815-3196-46cf-9b6f-707caf84c282&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CyberGhost&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5ZmQ5OTgxNS0zMTk2LTQ2Y2YtOWI2Zi03MDdjYWY4NGMyODIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY3liZXJnaG9zdHZwbi5jb20vZW5fVVMvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhZDkxNTA4Yi1iYmUxLTQ0ZTgtYTcxNi0wMjcyNGNiY2EzYWMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAbdpm0QDvyQD5IH5XMG0vgx732Wi0D5g6CgSmbUNZ9ln&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyberghostvpn.com%2Fen_US%2F\">CyberGhost</a> offers simultaneous connectivity on up to seven devices for $2.11 to $12.99 per month depending on subscription term. It supports several types of gadgets like routers, computers, smart TVs and more. It\u2019s similar to the support that ExpressVPN offers, but CyberGhost provides detailed instructions on how to set up the cross-platform connections, making it a bit more user-friendly for those purposes.</p><p>From a security perspective, CyberGhost completed an <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9fd99815-3196-46cf-9b6f-707caf84c282&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CyberGhost&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5ZmQ5OTgxNS0zMTk2LTQ2Y2YtOWI2Zi03MDdjYWY4NGMyODIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY3liZXJnaG9zdHZwbi5jb20vZW5fVVMvcHJpdmFjeWh1Yi9wcml2YWN5LWF1ZGl0LyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYWQ5MTUwOGItYmJlMS00NGU4LWE3MTYtMDI3MjRjYmNhM2FjIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAWD7lhX8ZieDthH9EWygIKy4IIeSgICAwqI21QHUOz0J&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyberghostvpn.com%2Fen_US%2Fprivacyhub%2Fprivacy-audit%2F\">independent security audit</a> by Deloitte earlier this year, runs a vulnerability disclosure program and provides access to <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=9fd99815-3196-46cf-9b6f-707caf84c282&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CyberGhost&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI5ZmQ5OTgxNS0zMTk2LTQ2Y2YtOWI2Zi03MDdjYWY4NGMyODIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY3liZXJnaG9zdHZwbi5jb20vZW5fVVMvcHJpdmFjeWh1Yi90cmFuc3BhcmVuY3ktcmVwb3J0LXE0LTIwMjIvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhZDkxNTA4Yi1iYmUxLTQ0ZTgtYTcxNi0wMjcyNGNiY2EzYWMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAe_poZl_Yc27_VrlW2KHv6GF6elXtlTjB-eAgSLHk_QE&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyberghostvpn.com%2Fen_US%2Fprivacyhub%2Ftransparency-report-q4-2022%2F\">a transparency report</a> explaining requests for its data. While it did pass all of our tests, it\u2019s worth noting that we had trouble connecting to servers in the United Kingdom and had to opt to run our gaming test through an Ireland-based server instead.</p><h2>Best for multiple devices: Surfshark</h2><p></p><p>As we mentioned before, connecting to a router can provide nearly unlimited access to devices in a single household. But <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=6119f7ca-bf13-40ba-b3f6-2a335a8890f6&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=surfshark&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2MTE5ZjdjYS1iZjEzLTQwYmEtYjNmNi0yYTMzNWE4ODkwZjYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9zdXJmc2hhcmsuY29tLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYWQ5MTUwOGItYmJlMS00NGU4LWE3MTYtMDI3MjRjYmNhM2FjIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAew67IgxBRqcZ6LIo58dh_RnSNSjrwxb8YksKDxdubiq&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsurfshark.com%2F\">Surfshark</a> is one of few VPNs that offer use on an unlimited number of devices without bandwidth restrictions, according to the company. And you get that convenience without a significant increase in price: Surfshark subscriptions cost about $2.49 to $12.95 per month, and the company recently conducted its <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/surfshark-passes-first-independent-no-logs-audit/\">first independent audit</a>.</p><p>We ran into some trouble connecting to Surfshark\u2019s WireGuard protocol, but tested on an IKEv2 protocol instead. It was a bit slow and struggled to connect for our geoblock test at first, but ultimately passed. What makes it different from other VPNs with unlimited connection options is that it has access to more servers and is available on more types of devices.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-vpn-130004396.html?src=rss", "link": "https://www.engadget.com/best-vpn-130004396.html?src=rss", "date_published": "2023-04-11 13:00:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "title": "The Morning After: Worldwide PC shipments plunge by a third", "description": "<p>Both Canalys and IDC estimate worldwide computer shipments <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/worldwide-pc-shipments-plunged-by-a-third-in-the-first-quarter-172543016.html\">dropped</a> 29 to 33 percent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2023.

The product-centric company is moving further into service offerings, moving from putting the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ikea-ar-app-lets-you-preview-its-furniture-in-your-own-house-130004284.html\">work in customer's hands with apps</a> to letting \"IKEA designers\" take care of everything. IKEA says they\u2019ll hold your hang through everything from picking out products to having them shipped over. It's also leveraging its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-28-ikea-buys-taskrabbit.html\">ownership of TaskRabbit</a> to link customers with DIY experts to put ordered furniture together when it arrives.</p><p>Clearly, IKEA thinks everyone has gotten comfortable enough with video calls over the last few years, as everything is done digitally, but the process does seem pretty straightforward: It starts with a questionnaire on the IKEA USA site and then three one-on-one video calls. Customers get a mood board and initial plans for the space to align the vision, followed by a meeting to approve ideas and products. They come out of it with 3D renderings, a mood board, floor plan, drawings, a list of products and material options.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>IKEA already offers something similar for kitchens, with customers able to schedule an appointment for their kitchen to be measured and designed for free with an <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=e43990ba-ed42-4a73-87a7-cd68b5f3d000&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=IKEA&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJlNDM5OTBiYS1lZDQyLTRhNzMtODdhNy1jZDY4YjVmM2QwMDAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaWtlYS5jb20vdXMvZW4vY3VzdG9tZXItc2VydmljZS9zZXJ2aWNlcy9raXRjaGVuLXBsYW5uaW5nLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOWVjNmYxYjctOGNlOS00NmE2LWEzZTMtNGZiNjY1MWM3N2FkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAR2xZ7K1TNnErE9PDwXZv_XX7tqVqIyru5floAwfQ_Py&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fcustomer-service%2Fservices%2Fkitchen-planning%2F\">IKEA kitchen planner</a>.
