<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1599/15997278/4124179-ow2bpgallerythumb.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/">Overwatch 2</a> Season 4 has arrived, bringing a new hero, Lifeweaver, alongside some changes to the game, like the removal of map pools in Competitive Mode. In addition to these changes, the new content is a brand-new battle pass, featuring 80 tiers of rewards, including a mythical Sigma skin. This <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-season-4-sends-heroes-to-a-galaxy-far-far-away-with-an-epic-space-opera-theme/1100-6513039/">season's battle pass is space opera-themed</a>, offering up some cosmetics that wouldn't look out of place in Star Wars. This ties into some skins that will be available later in the season and an upcoming event, Starwatch: Galactic Rescue. This includes the Galactic Emperor Sigma skin, the tier 80 reward, along with the Infinite Seer Mercy, Intergalactic Smuggler Ashe, and Extraterrestrial Winston.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard has announced two events for this season, Starwatch and a Pride event, with the latter kicking off in June, which is Pride month. In addition to this new content and upcoming events, Blizzard has made a few highly requested updates. On the Competitive front, rank decay has been removed, so players will no longer automatically drop to a lower rank at the start of the season. Season 4 also marks the removal of the map pool, no longer restricting which maps are available to be played on. Some smaller changes include a visible group skill rating for each time at the start of a competitive match and players can now see their own win-loss record for the mode.</p><p>There is also a new hero, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-season-4-could-be-the-start-of-the-games-redemption-arc/1100-6513124/">Lifeweaver</a>, a support hero who can grab teammates from a distance and pull them to safety. Like previous heroes, Lifeweaver is automatically unlocked with the premium version of the battle pass or at tier 45 of the free version. Lifeweaver will also be unavailable to play in Competitive for the first two weeks of the season, providing an opportunity to learn the hero in quick play before selecting him in a competitive match. Here's everything you can unlock in the Overwatch Season 4 battle pass.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Tier 1 - Lifeweaver (premium), Space Prince Lucio</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1599/15997278/4124180-1large.jpeg" /></p><br />     <p><h2>Tier 2 -

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/4124004-dek.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">With WWE Wrestlemania 2023 now firmly in the rearview mirror, we can now look back on the two-night event and marvel at how many marquee matches blew the audience away. Don't believe that? Well, make sure to check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wwe-wrestlemania-2023-night-1-results-and-review-sami-zayn-and-kevin-owens-best-the-bloodline/1100-6512771/">Wrestlemania 39 Night 1</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wwe-wrestlemania-2023-night-2-results-and-review/1100-6512895/">Night 2 reviews</a> for an idea of what it was like inside of SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles. There's more to Wrestlemania than the big show, though. There are WWE's various weekly shows that also take place over the weekend. More importantly, though, there's the Wrestlemania Superstore, which is much more than a place to buy the latest merchandise.</p><p dir="ltr">The Superstore also serves as a WWE museum, showcasing upcoming action figures, props, and some truly iconic costumes from throughout the company's long history. From displays highlighting the 2023 inductees in the WWE Hall of Fame, to beloved legends and the company's current top stars, WWE has done an incredible job of collecting superstar costumes over the years, keeping them in pristine condition for fans to see up close at the Wrestlemania Superstore. For those that don't travel to Wrestlemania, though, this is a piece of the event they don't get to experience.</p><p dir="ltr">Until now, that is. While at Wrestlemania, GameSpot visited the Superstore to document the costumes to share with those who weren't able to make the voyage to Southern California for Wrestlemania 39. Take a look below at the costumes on display and sound off with your favorite in the comments.

<p>Rockstar Games co-founder and Grand Theft Auto series co-creator Dan Houser and his wife Krystyna Jakubiak have paid $8.5 million to scoop up a Los Angeles area home, their third in the region and at least their fourth property in the United States. <a href="https://www.dirt.com/gallery/moguls/tech/dan-houser-house-pacific-palisades-1203629574/danhouserhouse_pp2-4/">According to Dirt</a>, Houser is the buyer of a six-bed, eight-bath, 7,000 square-foot New England-inspired home in Pacific Palisades, California.</p><p>The house--built in 2018--sits on .16-acre lot, but location is everything. The home has a fireplace and balcony off the main suite. The home also has a movie theater and entertainment room, as well as a temperature-controlled wine room that can fit more than 200 bottles. You can see inside the house <a href="https://www.compass.com/listing/1119-monument-street-pacific-palisades-ca-90272/1261874874261810881/">at the listing from Compass.</a></p><p>The home was originally listed for $10 million, but Houser and Jakubiak got it for $8.5 million on March 30. The seller might have had extra motivation to sell on an advanced timeline due to the recent <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/los-angeles-mansion-tax-real-estate-market-3922cf8">"mansion tax" in Los Angeles</a> that went into effect on April 1. It charges a 5.5% tax on homes sold for over $10 million, so the seller saved hundreds of thousands in taxes in this sale.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-creator-buys-la-mansion-for-8-5-million-see-photos-of-the-inside/1100-6513164/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## IGDA Releases New Game-Crediting Policies To Help Developers Get Recognition

<p>The <a href="https://igda.org/">International Game Developers Association</a> (IGDA) revealed on April 11 that it has updated its standards regarding developer credits in video games. According to the IGDA, its Game Credits Special Interest Group (SIG), has been working to "promote inclusivity and best practices for how credits are attributed [in video games]." Various IGDA SIGs have recently given feedback that resulted in the Game Crediting Guide getting its first update in over 10 years. But according to the association, there is still more work to be done.</p><p>"Employees [in the games industry] are often mislabeled, unlabeled, or left off [the list of credited developers], though they may have spent years of their life to bring a game to market," read an official statement released by IGDA earlier today. The association's claims are bolstered by the research performed by several IGDA interest groups. The results of the organization's 2023 State Of Credits survey give a particularly eye-opening look at the way industry employees are credited--or not credited--for their work.</p><p dir="ltr">According to the results of the survey (as reported by the IGDA Analytics SIG), 51.3% of participants said they "never," "seldom," or "sometimes" receive official credit for their efforts. Over 80% of participants selected "no" or "unsure" when asked if their workplace or client had any official policy regarding game credits in place.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/igda-releases-new-game-crediting-policies-to-help-developers-get-recognition/1100-6513167/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Arcade1Up Class Of '81 Deluxe Review - Put A Bow On It

<p dir="ltr">Arcade1Up has been producing home-arcade cabinets for more than four years, releasing titles from hit classics like Pac-Man to racers like Out Run and even lightgun shooters like Big Buck Hunter. With the exception of its expensive Killer Instinct Pro Series cabinet, however, all of its 3/4-scale systems have required a separate riser to reach a good standing height for adults. The risers don't look particularly good, break up the artwork on the cabinet, and add another step to the building process. Arcade1Up smartly decided to ditch the risers for its new Deluxe lineup, and after spending time with the Class of '81 Deluxe cabinet, I can confidently say it was the right move. Even better, it's just one of several changes that will make longtime home-arcade players very happy.</p><p dir="ltr">The Arcade1Up Deluxe lineup--despite its name implying a high price tag--is actually more in line with the company's cheaper Legacy cabinets, packing a variety of games from a particular publisher into one system for around $500. The Pac-Man and Mortal Kombat II machines each include 14 games, and in the case of the Class of '81 Deluxe cabinet, I got 12:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Ms. Pac-Man</li><li dir="ltr">Galaga</li><li dir="ltr">Galaga '88</li><li dir="ltr">Galaxian</li><li dir="ltr">Dig Dug</li><li dir="ltr">Dig Dug II</li><li dir="ltr">Mappy</li><li dir="ltr">Rally-X</li><li dir="ltr">Rolling Thunder</li><li dir="ltr">Rompers</li><li dir="ltr">The Tower of Druaga</li><li dir="ltr">King and Balloon</li></ul><p dir="ltr">There are a few absolute classics in this collection, including the two marquee games--Ms. Pac-Man and Galaga--as well as Galaga '88 and Dig Dug. The other Deluxe cabinets feature similarly prestigious games, so your choice will really come down to genre preference and nostalgia. There are certainly a few here that I wouldn't consider winners, especially The Tower of Druaga, but almost everything is at least worth giving a shot.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arcade1up-class-of-81-deluxe-review-put-a-bow-on-it/1100-6513165/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

This location will likely be a hot spot to drop for a week or two as people finish the Eren Jaeger quests, but all you need to do is make it in the door to finish this one.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-jaegers-family-basement-location-guide/1100-6513163/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## The CW's Arrowverse Began Exploring The Multiverse Long Before The MCU Got There

<p dir="ltr">The concept of a multiverse has been around for decades--other versions of our reality that represent the different decisions we could make, and the countless variables of our world. In recent years, though, the multiverse has become a staple of pop culture, whether it's the Academy Award-winning Everything Everywhere All At Once, FX's Devs TV series, or more broadly, the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The MCU kicked open the doors of its own multiverse in 2021 with Spider-Man: No Way Home and began to explore it more deeply with Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and Ant-Man and the Wasp in Quantumania. Before the MCU ever dared, though, The CW's Arrowverse began exploring the multiverse concept years earlier, predating even Sony's excellent Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.</p><figure style="width: 1280px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1603/16030002/4098343-spiderman-beyond-04.jpg"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4098343-spiderman-beyond-04.png" /></a></figure><p dir="ltr">The Flash kicked things off way back in Season 2. One of the biggest mysteries of Season 2 was the question of who was hidden under the iron mask in Hunter Zolomon's cage. The man in the iron mask turned out to be none other than Jay Garrick, the Flash of Earth-2. Series showrunners cast John Wesley Shipp in the role, who was best known for playing The Flash on the CBS TV series, which aired in 1990 and 1991. Alongside Garrick, the show also introduced Tom Cavanagh's second character on the show, Harry Wells, an Earth-2 variant of Harrison Wells. Just weeks later, Barry and Cisco would find themselves on Earth-38, where they would meet Supergirl--a show airing on CBS at that time. That gave us three canonical Earth variants for the CW in 2016.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 3 then began with Barry's first truly big mistake, when he went back in time to stop Reverse-Flash from killing his mother and, in the process, created a new timeline with lots of changes that gave the Arrowverse showrunners an opportunity to make a lot of little changes. This was the Arrowverse's take on Flashpoint, a comic book storyline that's also being explored in the upcoming Flash movie.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-cws-arrowverse-began-exploring-the-multiverse-long-before-the-mcu-got-there/1100-6513141/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Dead Island 2 Has Some Surprisingly High PC Requirements

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dead-island-2/">Dead Island 2</a> developer Dambuster Studios has shared the official PC requirements for the game, and if you're looking to carve up a few zombie hordes, you're going to need to pack some moderately powerful hardware in your system to do so. While the storage capacity, operating system, and RAM requirements sound standard for any modern game, Dead Island 2 does have some demanding requirements for the CPUs and GPUs needed to play the game in either Recommended, High, or Ultra modes.</p><p>At the bare minimum for a 1080p 30fps experience, you'll be able to scrape by with some older PC technology, but increasing performance to 1440p at 60fps will require a more modern AMD Ryzen 7 700X or Intel Core i5 CPU and an Nvidia RTX 3070 GPU. On the plus side, you'll only need 70GB of storage space for Dead Island 2, which is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-survivor-pc-specs-confirmed-155gb-free-space-required/1100-6513018/">less than half of the capacity</a> that Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is demanding.</p><p>To reach the 4K 60fps benchmark, you'll need to have an Nvidia RTX 3090 or an AMD Radeon RX 6950 to see some sharp and disturbing details. You can see the full specs below for what you'll need to run Dead Island 2 on PC. Dead Island 2 launches on April 21, 2023, and it'll also be available for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, Xbox One, and PS4.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-island-2-has-some-surprisingly-high-pc-requirements/1100-6513162/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Blizzard Can't Decide How To Balance This WoW Wrath Classic Class

<p>Feral Druid players in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/">World of Warcraft</a>: Wrath of the Lich King Classic have had a whirlwind adventure the last few days, as Blizzard made major changes to the specialization, quickly sought to nerf aspects of the class, and then walked some of the changes back.</p><p dir="ltr">Last week, Blizzard looked to put a dent in a popular Feral Druid playstyle known as "bearweaving" by making specific changes to the class specialization. Blizzard said in a <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/feral-druid-adjustments-coming-soon-april-3rd-2023/1561219">forum post</a> on the subject that bearweaving increased the "mechanical complexity of the class to a degree far above what was intended in original Wrath of the Lich King," and so the team wanted to essentially eliminate the meta playstyle. To replace it, Blizzard sought to make Feral more powerful in PvE without the need to bearweave, while not wanting to affect the specialization's performance in PvP.</p><p dir="ltr">That was all easier said than done. Though the various class changes did have the desired effect of smoothing out the specialization's rotation and improving DPS for average players without need to shift in and out of bear form, Blizzard in a new <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wotlk-stealth-change-to-feral/1566375/5">forum post</a> writes that it quickly became apparent it "underestimated" how strong of a buff the changes would be for top-level Feral players in PvE. To counteract the stronger-than-expected buff to Feral, Blizzard sought to change the damage increase bonus from the class's Naturalist talent from 10% to 5%.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-cant-decide-how-to-balance-this-wow-wrath-classic-class/1100-6513161/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Horror Director Ari Aster Continues His Head-Turning Calling Card In Beau Is Afraid

<p>Celebrated horror director Ari Aster is back with a new movie, Beau Is Afraid, and it's now come to light that the film will continue a theme that Aster is becoming known for. <strong>Spoilers for Beau Is Afraid and Aster's other films follow below.</strong></p><div>          </div><p><a href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/ari-aster-decapitation-scene-beau-is-afraid-makes-me-laugh/">Speaking to Empire</a>, Aster confirmed that Beau Is Afraid will feature another decapitation scene. This has become Aster's calling card, of sorts, as his 2018 film Hereditary contained multiple sequences in which characters lose their heads. 2019's Midsommar continued this tradition, in a way, with a character bludgeoned to death with a massive hammer to the head. It's not a decapitation, per se, but it's still serious, life-ending head trauma. As it turns out, Aster isn't doing this by accident--he is purposefully including decapitation scenes, and now he accepts that it's become a running joke that he is keen to continue.</p><p>"It's a joke at this point," he told Empire. "I mean, it <em>is</em> a joke in this one. What can I say, it makes me laugh."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/horror-director-ari-aster-continues-his-head-turning-calling-card-in-beau-is-afraid/1100-6513157/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Book Of Boba Fett's Luke Skywalker Gets Star Wars Retro Figure

<p dir="ltr">Every generation has a hero and, honestly, chances are that hero is Luke Skywalker, regardless of the generation we're talking about. While Luke was clearly in his prime during the original Star Wars series, he also popped up (as a baby) in the prequels, had his time in the sun in the sequel trilogy, and has even had roles on Disney+'s Star Wars TV shows. After first appearing at the end of The Mandalorian Season 2, played by a digitally de-aged Mark Hamill, the hero returned yet again in The Book of Boba Fett, once again with Hamill in the role, and now that version of Luke is being released as a Retro Collection toy, which GameSpot can exclusively reveal.</p><p dir="ltr">This fall, Hasbro will be releasing a new Luke Skywalker Retro figure based on his time at the Jedi Academy, as seen in The Book of Boba Fett. The figure comes with Luke's signature lightsaber, a blaster, and his hooded Jedi robe. And if you're wondering why the toy isn't a perfect recreation of Hamill's face as it appeared on the show, it actually looks a lot closer to the original Luke Skywalker figure that was released following Star Wars: A New Hope, as well as the other Retros that have been released over the years. If the Retro Collection is something that appeals to you, this is definitely going to be near the top of your wishlist.</p><figure style="width: 1300px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4123681-starwarsretrocollectionlukeskywalker%28jediacademy%291.jpg"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1578/15789737/4123681-starwarsretrocollectionlukeskywalker%28jediacademy%291.jpg" /></a></figure><figure><div class="image-gallery__label">Gallery</div>   <div class="image-gallery__list hide-scrollbar">       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4123682-starwarsretrocollectionlukeskywalker%28jediacademy%291.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 1" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1578/15789737/4123682-starwarsretrocollectionlukeskywalker%28jediacademy%291.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4123683-starwarsretrocollectionlukeskywalker%28jediacademy%292.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 2" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1578/15789737/4123683-starwarsretrocollectionlukeskywalker%28jediacademy%292.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4123684-starwarsretrocollectionlukeskywalker%28jediacademy%293.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 3" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1578/15789737/4123684-starwarsretrocollectionlukeskywalker%28jediacademy%293.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4123685-starwarsretrocollectionlukeskywalker%28jediacademy%294.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 4" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1578/15789737/4123685-starwarsretrocollectionlukeskywalker%28jediacademy%294.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4123686-starwarsretrocollectionlukeskywalker%28jediacademy%295.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 5" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1578/15789737/4123686-starwarsretrocollectionlukeskywalker%28jediacademy%295.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4123687-starwarsretrocollectionlukeskywalker%28jediacademy%296.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 6" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1578/15789737/4123687-starwarsretrocollectionlukeskywalker%28jediacademy%296.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4123688-starwarsretrocollectionlukeskywalker%28jediacademy%297.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 7" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1578/15789737/4123688-starwarsretrocollectionlukeskywalker%28jediacademy%297.jpg" />     </a>   </div>  </figure><p dir="ltr"><span>You can check out multiple images of the figure above, though it's worth noting that the packaging displayed is not the final product.

<p dir="ltr">The popular subscription service PC Game Pass is expanding today to 40 more countries, such as Bolivia, Honduras, and Kuwait. Microsoft previously noted that this brings the program to 86 countries overall.</p><p dir="ltr">PC Game Pass offers first-party games from Xbox on their release date. So when Redfall comes out May 2, the game will be available on the subscription service. This is on top of third-party games available as well as the EA Play library.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/04/11/pc-game-pass-now-available-40-countries/">Microsoft</a> says there will be a special offer for people who sign up to PC Game Pass in the new countries for their first three months.

## Counter-Strike Modder Releases Impressive Roguelike Mode For Laughs

<p dir="ltr">Counter-Strike 2 isn't here yet, but it's already produced an unexpected result for fans--the release of a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2959389971">roguelike mod</a> for CS:GO. Yes, the biggest multiplayer shooter of the moment now has a surprisingly in-depth run-based mode in the style of games like Hades and The Binding of Isaac, and you can play it right now.</p><p dir="ltr">Titled Rogue, the mode is the brainchild of Counter-Strike modder Orel. In the release notes for the mod, Orel says that they've worked on it as a "labor of love," but the upcoming release of Counter-Strike 2 has inspired them to release it in a sort of Early Access state. The modder thinks that it's likely that the transition to the new version will essentially break Rogue as it currently exists, so fans might as well try it now.</p><p dir="ltr">The mode includes eight playable characters, booster packs, cards, and spendable XP, as well as hordes of enemies to slay. It can be played single-player or with a group of up to three friends. Altogether, though it is clearly unfinished, it's an interesting experiment, and certainly worth checking out if you enjoy roguelike games.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/counter-strike-modder-releases-impressive-roguelike-mode-for-laughs/1100-6513152/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

However, players will still be able to play, create, and share Dreams with others after September. The toy train adventure game made inside Dreams, called Tren, as well as a final Create mode update, are still coming.</p><p>"We know this won't be an easy message for everyone to hear, and it's certainly not been an easy decision," explained Media Molecule in a <a href="https://docs.indreams.me/en-US/whats-happening/news/dreams-support-update">statement</a>.

In a recent <a href="https://ew.com/movies/chris-pratt-mario-accent-goodfellas-tony-soprano/">Entertainment Weekly</a> interview, Pratt revealed that one of his first attempts at the Mario voice got rejected by the film's directors, Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, because it resembled Tony Soprano, the mob boss played by James Gandolfini in HBO’s The Sopranos.</p><p dir="ltr">"We tried different things, different voices," Day added.

<p>The New York Times has added a new daily puzzle game to its library in the form of Digits. This collection of math conundrums tasks you with reaching a designated number by using six numbers that you're free to multiply, divide, subtract, or add up to reach the final result, so long as your process doesn't create any fractions or negative numbers.</p><p>Currently in beta and only available for this week, there'll be five of these math puzzles to solve every day. These aren't one-and-done puzzles like Wordle, and depending on the path you choose to solve one of these math mysteries, you'll be awarded 1-3 star ratings. If you're interested, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/digits">you can try out Digits through this link</a>.</p><p>If Digits proves to be popular with its readers, the New York Times will then start work on the further development of the game.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-new-york-times-debuts-digits-the-math-version-of-wordle/1100-6513150/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Get ready to blast away pixelated daemons of Chaos because Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun is releasing sooner than you might think. The '90s-inspired FPS is set to launch May 23 on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.</p><p dir="ltr">Developer Auroch Digital dropped the release date on <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/04/11/warhammer-40-000-boltgun-releases-may-23-new-gameplay-details-revealed/">the PlayStation Blog</a> while detailing how the retro shooter pays homage to classics like Doom. For example, Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun lead designer Grant Stewart says the FPS "uses a hybrid system taking the best of modern technology and slamming it, pixels first, into the old ways." Basically, the studio creates 3D models for enemies and then takes pictures of them to ultimately make 2D flipbook animations. This process creates a vintage look for the game.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun will also utilize modern AI to update enemy behaviors, since a lot of shooters from decades ago could feel like a "very sophisticated target range," according to Stewart. That means foes can dynamically spawn depending on player position in addition to appearing in handpicked spots by the developer.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40000-boltgun-is-out-this-may-watch-the-new-trailer/1100-6513148/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

So the exact end result has been somewhat hazy, but now, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hbo-max-could-be-renamed-max-report/1100-6509716/">after a few months of rumors</a>, that service has a name: Max, revealed by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/11/business/media/max-streaming-warner-hbo.html">New York Times</a>. </p><p>According to the Times' sources, Max will debut in the next month or two and will cost about $16 a month, the price of HBO Max now. It was also reported that there will be several price tiers, including a less expensive one with advertising, following suit in similar models that Hulu, Netflix, and Disney+ have been experimenting with for a few months now. </p><p>Max's official announcement will be coming Wednesday, April 12, to discuss the product in a press event. The event will be a video webcast for the company's investors as well as the general public, according to a press release, A replay of the webcast will be available after the conclusion of the presentation.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-streaming-service-max-combines-hbo-max-with-discovery-for-16-month/1100-6513151/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Sales for the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ps5/"> PlayStation 5</a> have increased by 180% in the UK during the first quarter of 2023, when compared to the same period in 2022. This helped push the console market overall, with a 24.2% increase in sales overall during the same time period compared to last year.</p><p>This comes by way of <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/hogwarts-legacy-and-ps5-rescue-uk-games-market-in-q1-2023-uk-monthy-charts">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, which pulls data from GfK and GSD. Despite the success of consoles overall in this market, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nintendo-switch/">Nintendo Switch</a> sales are down by over 25%, though it was still the second-best-selling console for Q1 2023. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/xbox-series-x/">Xbox Series X|S</a> sales were down by 18%. This means the PS5 was a main driver of console sales overall during this time period. The PS5 was still difficult to find during the first quarter of 2022, but now its availability has improved, making it easier to buy from retailers.</p><p>The PS5 was the best-selling console during the month of March 2023, followed by the Nintendo Switch--which actually increased in sales when compared to February 2023. Of the Switch systems sold in March, the Super Mario bundle contributed to 12.8% of sales, the White OLED bundle led to 23.6%, and the Neon Switch accounted for 26.3%.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-sales-surging-in-the-uk-while-switch-and-xbox-drop-off/1100-6513147/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Cyberpunk 2077's Overdrive mode is now available, and if you have the right hardware, you'll be able to experience a technology preview that pushes the boundaries of what current hardware is capable of. You'll need to own one of the latest--and expensive--Nvidia 40-series graphics cards to get Overdrive Mode working on your PC, but if you have it, expect a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-new-overdrive-mode-makes-the-game-really-really-ridiculously-good-looking/1100-6512978/">really, really ridiculously good-looking</a> version of Cyberpunk 2077.</p><p>If you're still stuck in last-gen, there is some good news here as CD Projekt Red says that a measly GeForce RTX 3090 GPU can run Overdrive Mode, but at 1080p and 30fps. Alternatively, CDPR has enabled the mode on older hardware, but with a neat twist. Ray-tracing-capable PC graphics cards with at least 8GB VRAM will be capable of rendering path-traced screenshots in Photo Mode. This is possible because it means that these GPUs just need to render one frame, as opposed to rendering several frames every second when playing the game.</p><p>"Note that the higher the resolution and the less powerful the GPU is, the longer it will take to take a screenshot (between a few seconds to several minutes)," <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/47875/patch-1-62-ray-tracing-overdrive-mode">CDPR explained</a> in its new patch notes.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-update-adds-new-mode-that-pretty-much-no-one-can-play/1100-6513144/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Microsoft has signed yet another 10-year cloud gaming deal in a move that appears to be part of the Xbox company's efforts to convince regulators that its proposed deal to buy Activision Blizzard should be allowed to go through. Microsoft and UK mobile network EE have announced a "10-year commitment" for cloud gaming to bring Activision Blizzard's PC games to EE customers.</p><p>"We are committed to bring more games to more people, however they choose to play," Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said on Twitter. EE executive Marc Allera, meanwhile, said EE is "delighted" to be working with Microsoft to help make EE the "no. 1 destination for gamers..."</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">Microsoft and <a href="https://twitter.com/EE?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">@EE</a> are expanding our partnership with a 10-year commitment in cloud gaming to bring PC games built by Activision Blizzard, following the acquisition, and Xbox to <a href="https://twitter.com/EE?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">@EE</a> customers.

The UK's Competition &amp; Markets Authority has provisionally concluded that Microsoft's proposed deal to buy Activision Blizzard will not limit competition in the <strong>console </strong>space, but the CMA continues to have concerns about the <strong>cloud </strong>market. Microsoft announcing these deals with key UK players in the cloud space seems to be connected with all of this. Whether or not this is enough to get the deal done, however, remains to be seen. And even if the buyout clears regulatory hurdles in the UK (the deadline is April 26), Microsoft still needs to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ftc-wants-more-information-about-microsofts-future-zenimax-exclusivity-and-its-10-year-deals/1100-6512379/">convince the United States government to clear the deal.</a></p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-keeps-pushing-to-get-activision-deal-done-with-another-10-year-cloud-gaming-pact/1100-6513143/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
