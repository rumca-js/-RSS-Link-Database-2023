First, of course, because of the locust swarm itself. Second, because animal research \u2014 even on creatures as simple and pestilent as locusts \u2014 always raises ethical questions. Now, the researchers are careful with the locusts, and I don't think many people could have a problem with this. Indeed, most of the world currently has zero ethical restrictions on insect experimentation \u2014 but it's still worth interrogating whether this is okay. And finally: because if we can do this so easily to less intelligent creatures... what's to stop something more intelligent coming along and doing the same to us?\n\nI'm at https://tomscott.com\non Twitter at https://twitter.com/tomscott\non Facebook at https://facebook.com/tomscott\nand on Instagram as tomscottgo", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRIBVykhpC4", "date_published": "2023-04-17 15:00:19+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
