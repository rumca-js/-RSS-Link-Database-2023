Today, Sara Haines shared her painfully ironic take on abortion - that pro-life conservatives are playing God. Yes, pro-lifers. The same people who want babies, conceived by the will of God, to be born. </p><p>I grow tired. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cSara Haines unironically suggests conservatives are "playing God" and "saving curtain lives" with pro-life laws, while falsely suggesting most pro-life laws don't have exceptions to protect the mother's life.\nAnd she pushes the BIG LIE that pro-lifers don't support after birth.\u201d</div> — Nicholas Fondacaro (@Nicholas Fondacaro)
        <a href="https://twitter.com/NickFondacaro/status/1647984509097242630">1681744326</a>
</blockquote>

<p>The ladies were discussing their arch nemesis <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-trump-statement" target="_blank">Ron DeSantis</a> and his recent 6-week heartbeat abortion bill. The bill prohibits abortions once the unborn child has a detectible heartbeat. I gotta be honest, I was a little disappointed in DeSantis, since a complete ban on abortion would be preferable. But it's a step. </p><p>And it was <em>definitely</em> enough to get The View riled up (though that doesn't seem very difficult to do). Ana Navarro claimed he tried to hide the bill, despite the fact he publicly advertised the signing of said bill. He literally tweeted it out. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cSigned the Heartbeat Protection Act, which expands pro-life protections and devotes resources to help young mothers and families.\u201d</div> — Ron DeSantis (@Ron DeSantis)

</blockquote>

<p>And then they got to Sara Haines, who piggy-backed on the claim that 11 states would choose the life of the child over the mother by failing to protect pregnant mothers in life-threatening scenarios. </p><p><em>"When you say 11 of the 13 states that are making these rulings aren't considering the mom, now you're just playing God [...] Now you're saving certain lives and not other lives."</em></p><p>This simply cannot be true, because there is <a href="https://prolifereplies.liveaction.org/medically-necessary/" target="_blank">never a case</a> where an abortion is medically necessary to save the life of the mother. Doctors never write women a prescription to Planned Parenthood. At times, the same procedures are necessary, like when a mother suffers a miscarriage and has to have the already-deceased child removed from her uterus. Or sometimes, like in the case of an ectopic pregnancy, the treatment for the condition unfortunately results in the death of the child. But that isn't an abortion, because the ultimate goal of the procedure is <em>not</em> to kill the child. The intention is to treat the mother's condition. Any halfway decent doctor can tell the difference between a life-saving procedure and an illegal abortion. <span></span></p><p>Haines wasn't done, going on to claim that pro-lifers do nothing for the child after it is born. Which is also not true. To be fair, she may not be aware of this, since <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/janes-revenge-arrest" target="_blank">Antifa fire-bombed</a> all the pro-life centers that care for children after they are born. So we could give her the benefit of the doubt there. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

<p>The new ad begins with a narrator's voice saying, “This is a story bigger than beer.

None of which have to do with beer. </p><p>Budweiser clearly gathered its marketing team and brainstormed a list of "conservative" imagery on a whiteboard, and then edited together footage of a horse running in front of said imagery.

<p>While this is very silly and rightfully frustrating, it's not at all surprising.

They've all been brainwashed. </p><p>I do think it's possible to return to the pre-brainwashing era, when companies actually did support traditional morals and values and weren't trying to destroy America from within. It'll take some work, sure. But it's possible. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

<p>Crowder pointed out that for a biological male, guaranteed outcomes of increasing estrogen and decreasing testosterone are osteoporosis, depression, increased cancer risk, and more. So can this really be considered "healthcare"? </p><p>Crowder also highlighted a photo of Tyson's son shared by Tyson, where the son was wearing heels. Tyson captured the photo, "Tucker chose to slay this morning." Crowder then pointed out how the other side would deny the possibility that the recent increase in trans-identifying individuals is due to social contagion, and deny that they encourage their children to be trans - but also purchase child-size, sparkly high heels for their male children. </p><p>Crowder explained that it can be innocent for kids to dress up as the other gender, and it almost always remains innocent until adults sexualize and read into it. Kids aren't allowed to be kids anymore because any preference they show could spark parents to believe they're a different gender than their biological sex. </p><p>There was a lot more to this segment, and on the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ryan-long-nephew" target="_blank">trans agenda</a> in general- specifically the latest SNL star, who also happens to be nonbinary and supportive of trans-ing the kids. Crowder and crew also covered Washington state's latest law that allows kids to be removed from their parents if they're seeking transgender "medical" care. So be sure to catch the whole show on Rumble - you don't wanna miss it. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rumble">

Because we just don't have enough. And this one may just be the most disturbing to date. </p><p>Miami-based Dr. Sidhbh Gallagher has gone viral in the past for her "yeet the teet" videos, where she celebrates <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/rady-center-transgender-children" target="_blank">cutting off the healthy breasts</a> of adolescent girls. In this newest viral clip, Gallagher explains how a "eunuch" is someone "who is assigned male at birth but may not be comfortable with the masculine features.” </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cPlastic surgeon Dr. Sidhbh Gallagher is promoting the eunuch gender identity, citing guidelines by WPATH devised with input from men in an online forum creating and hosting sadomasochistic written pornography about castrating and raping children.\nhttps://t.co/x4ZhNRYlLQ\u201d</div> — Women's Voices (@Women's Voices)

<p>It's important to note that the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/eunuch" target="_blank">official definition</a> of a "eunuch" is "<span style="background-color: initial;">a castrated man placed in charge of a harem or employed as a chamberlain in a palace" or "</span><span style="background-color: initial;">a man or boy deprived of the testes or external genitals". Historically, servants and slaves were often castrated to make them "safer" to the ruler whom they were in close contact with. In China, men were castrated as a form of punishment and as a means of being employed in the imperial service. So it wasn't a "gender identity" - it was a barbaric, dehumanizing practice. </span></p><p>But Gallagher describes eunuchs as "gender-diverse individuals," and claims they may benefit from "gender-affirming care," like orchiectomy. Which is the surgical removal of the testes. She created the video to answer a question about someone who may want to remove their testicles even if they aren't transgender. </p><p>Gallagher also explained the risks of removing a male's testicles, effectively castrating them: "Patients can have problems with osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. So usually the patient will supplement on either low-dose testosterone or low-dose oestrogen, and it requires specialized care, but sometimes this is an important part of gender affirmation surgery for this group of patients." </p><p>She mentioned the chapter on eunuchs in the standards released by World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH). According to WPATH, eunuch is the "oldest recognized gender outside the binary,” and children can identify as eunuch.</p><p><em>"Like other gender diverse individuals, eunuch individuals may be aware of their identity in childhood or adolescence. Due to the lack of research into the treatment of children who may identify as eunuchs, we refrain from making specific suggestions.”</em></p><p><em>“While there is a 4000-year history of eunuchs in society, the greatest wealth of information about contemporary eunuch-identified people is found within the large online peer-support community that congregates on sites such as the Eunuch Archive (www.eunuch.org), which was established in 1998."  </em></p><p>Fair warning if you intend to do a little more digging yourself: the Eunuch Archive contains child-castration pornography. So viewer discretion is advised. But it's a resource WPATH relied on to come up with its standards. Horrifying. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

The full discussion doesn't air until this evening. But if this teaser is any indication, it'll be quite newsy. Hopefully, Elon kissed and made up with <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/matt-taibbi-congressional-hearing" target="_blank">Matt Taibbi</a> and it leads to more Twitter Files.</p><p>It sounds like the setup is Tucker asking the Head Twit In Charge what surprised him when he first dug deep into his new purchase.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://t.co/BilzqLGZsC">pic.twitter.com/BilzqLGZsC</a><br />— Tucker Carlson (@TuckerCarlson) <a href="https://twitter.com/TuckerCarlson/status/1647675042426232832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 16, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p><em>"The degree to which various government agencies effectively had full access to everything that was going on at Twitter blew my mind."</em></p><p>And when Tucker asked if that included reading our direct message, Musk responded, "Yes."</p><p>Context matters though every possible "context" I can think of is still terrifying. The word "effectively" does a lot of heavy lifting. Elon could mean the basic stuff we have seen in the <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/elon-musk-twitter-files" target="_blank">Twitter Files</a>, where Twitter employees <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/twitter-feds-twitter-seven" target="_blank">were happy to work with the feds</a> whenever the feds asked them to. That's bad, but it's bad we already know about and had already assumed.</p><p>Worse would be that government agencies were given DIRECT ACCESS  to Twitter. As in, they were given login credentials and could snoop around whenever they felt like it. All the money in my pockets say Twitter old regime wouldn't allow that if the government was snooping on their progressive comrades.</p><p>I hope Elon goes into detail tonight. Or at the very least, release the info on Twitter.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Watch: Pete Buttigieg makes bizarre claim racial discrimination causes car crashes

No, he didn't comment on the problems with airlines or the bizarre number of train derailments. No, he actually claimed that racism is somehow involved in the number of car crashes. Because of course, it is. </p><p>Speaking on MSNBC, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/doocy-corners-kjp-buttigieg" target="_blank">Buttigieg</a> began by highlighting the "crisis of roadway fatalities in America." According to him, 40,000 people a year perish in automobile-related accidents, a level "comparable to gun violence." Which I can believe, given the amount of crazy car accidents I see every day. </p><p>But then he started to veer off into more questionable territory. Like somehow blaming these car accidents on racism. </p><p>"We see a lot of racial disparities. Black and brown Americans, tribal citizens and rural residents - much more likely to lose their lives, whether it's in a car or as a pedestrian being hit by a car."</p><p>Um...what. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/pete-buttigieg-patrick-wojahn" target="_blank">Buttigieg</a> then tried to explain his reasoning for this: "There are a lot of reasons related to discrimination, related to - even the ways that roads are designed and built, who has access to a safe street design that's got crosswalks and good lighting, and who doesn't have that access. That can drive disparities. And we have a responsibility to act on that." </p><p>Okay....so I guess he's arguing that urban areas tend to have worse roads, and since those areas <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2018/05/22/demographic-and-economic-trends-in-urban-suburban-and-rural-communities/" target="_blank">tend to have</a> more minorities, the frequency of car accidents is related to racism.  I don't see anything wrong with improving city roads. Those things tend to be a major pain in the caboose. But why and how does it have anything to do with race? I don't think anyone purposely gets into a car accident based on the race of the other driver. So couldn't we fix problematic and dangerous roads, add more crosswalks and lights, etc. <em>without</em> divisive racial rhetoric? No? Ok. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## New UN Report Calls For Decriminalization of Sex Between Minors And Adults, Claims It Can Be 'Consensual'

<p>The report was written by the International Committee of Jurists (ICJ), UNAIDS and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and released on International Women's Day. The goal of the report, apparently, was to guide “the application of international human rights law to criminal law.” According to the authors, criminalizing anything related to “sex, drug use, HIV, sexual and reproductive health, homelessness and poverty” is a violation of human rights. </p><p>I can see how *some* laws in *some* of those categories could potentially be human rights violations. But then the report literally calls for <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/berkeley-12-year-old" target="_blank">children to be able to consent</a> to sex with adults. </p><p>"<em>With respect to the enforcement of criminal law, any prescribed minimum age of consent to sex must be applied in a non-discriminatory manner. Enforcement may not be linked to the sex/gender of participants or age of consent to marriage. Moreover, <strong>sexual conduct involving persons below the domestically prescribed minimum age of consent to sex may be consensual, in fact, if not in law</strong>. In this context, the enforcement of criminal law should reflect the<strong> rights and capacity of persons under 18 years of age to make decisions about engaging in consensual sexual conduct</strong> and their right to be heard in matters concerning them.</em></p><p><em>Pursuant to their evolving capacities and progressive autonomy, persons under 18 years of age should participate in decisions affecting them, with due regard to their age, maturity and best interests, and with specific attention to non-discrimination guarantees."<br /></em></p><p>Ahem: no. </p><p>Children cannot consent to sex. That's it. No more. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

But more poignantly: I was fired by the Biden administration for being a trans woman that owns a gun.</blockquote><p>Yeah, turns out the video in question was uploaded weeks before the shooting. So Kayla was only issuing a threat and NOT issuing a thread in solidarity with a child murderer. Whoops.</p><blockquote>And when I say the Biden administration I mean literally that. My boss just called me, crying, to tell me that he did everything he could to stop this outcome but the call to fire me came directly from Washington. So someone fairly high in the Department of Agriculture fired me.</blockquote><p>The Secretary of Agriculture is Tom Vilsack, a cis-white man. Figures.</p><blockquote>I guess when Biden told us "I've got your back" he meant he was going to stick a knife in it.</blockquote><p>Yep. Go ask leftists with massive amounts of college debt who voted Democrat in 2022 thinking Joe Biden was going to bail them out. LOSERS!</p><p>You feel for Kayla. You claw your way up to the top of the left's pound-for-pound most marginalized rankings. And it's STILL not enough to keep your government job when you post potential terrorist threats publically on social media apps. The struggle for equity continues.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
