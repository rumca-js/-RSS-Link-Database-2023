  <p id="lHr1ag">Console hacker Gary Bowser is getting released from federal prison after spending over two years behind bars, as first reported <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/nintendo-hacker-gary-bowser-released-from-federal-prison-230417/">by <em>TorrentFreak</em></a> (<a href="https://gizmodo.com/nintendo-hacker-gary-bowser-soon-to-be-released-prison-1850344573">via <em>Gizmodo</em></a>). In <a href="https://youtu.be/IGHDuYkdK7M">an interview with YouTuber Nick Moses</a>, Bowser says he was released to a Washington detention center last month, where he now awaits his return to his home country of Canada.</p>
<p id="OYOwaA"><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21499297/team-xecuter-selling-nintendo-hacks-arrested-charged-fraud">Bowser was arrested and charged with fraud in 2020</a> for his role in Team Xecuter, a hacking group that made and sold mod chips for the Nintendo Switch, 3DS, NES Classic Edition, Sony’s PlayStation Classic, and other consoles. Since Bowser was living in the Dominican Republic at the time, he was extradited to the US <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/10/22927827/gary-bowser-sentenced-nintendo-switch-hacks-team-xecuter">to serve his 40-month sentence</a>, which he says has been cut short due to good behavior.</p>

Instead, they’ll be sitting on one of the two rear captain seats, which are glamorously appointed in diamond-stitched Nappa leather and come with electric recliner seats, pillows, removable tablet screens, and even a bottle chiller to keep the drive <em>alive</em>.</p>
<p id="ecoNMv">The interior of the Maybach, of course, is designed for maximum comfort for the riders — but that comes at the cost of practicality. Even though it’s an SUV, it only sits four instead of five to seven people, something that makes more sense in the sedan S-Class Maybach vehicles.</p>

People <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/news/5841539549/photographer-captures-aurora-borealis-timelapse-from-airplane">see the northern lights on their flights to Iceland</a>, right? Might as well check. I was sitting parallel to the wing, the blue and yellow Icelandair logo lit against the black sky. But as I looked back toward the tail of the plane, I saw something else: a faint white smudge in the sky. I looked away and back a few times, and sure enough, the light was moving. I could just make out a white line with vertical bands radiating upward. Not the awe-inspiring green waves you’d hope for, but not nothing.</p>

They add quite a dynamic pop of color and flare to a home gaming, streaming, or entertainment space, especially since they can connect to Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, or Samsung’s SmartThings and do things like sync to music or to what’s on a screen.

  <p id="NWsVKS">Netflix ran into significant issues with its second live event on Sunday evening. <em>Love is Blind: The Live Reunion</em> failed to start streaming at its planned 8PM showtime, leading to major consternation from the show’s fans across social media. <a href="https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1647754054989402112">Netflix acknowledged the problem on Twitter</a> soon after and promised to kick off the presentation within 15 minutes.</p>
<p id="s5sul0">That didn’t happen, either. More than an hour later, subscribers were still encountering error screens when trying to watch the event. Netflix followed up by <a href="https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1647754054989402112">saying it’d be “worth the wait.”</a> As the delay stretched on, hosts Vanessa and Nick Lachey posted to Instagram thanking fans (and a live studio audience) for their extended patience.</p>
