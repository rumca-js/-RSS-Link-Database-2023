<p>Just like that, a new Harry Potter game is on its way.

## Canada's CBC is the latest to leave Twitter in objection to 'goverment-funded' label

<p>It's not just American broadcasters <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pbs-has-also-quit-twitter-over-its-government-funded-media-label-164843803.html">departing Twitter</a> in opposition to the "government-funded media" label. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) is "<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/cbc-twitter-government-funded-media-1.6812591">pausing</a>" its use of Twitter over the label's implication that the government may influence its editorial output. Reporting is "impartial and independent," the media outlet says.</p><p>There's no word on whether or not the CBC is in discussions with Twitter to alter the label. We've asked the broadcaster for comment. The UK's British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=60e97fc3-5759-41aa-a73b-6317bb989588&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=BBC&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2MGU5N2ZjMy01NzU5LTQxYWEtYTczYi02MzE3YmI5ODk1ODgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmJjLmNvbS9uZXdzL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQtYXJ0cy02NTI0ODU1NC5hbXAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjgxMDE2YjQwLWJjNmUtNDMwNC1iMjQ3LTRlNGZmZGM2MzA2NyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAafmE5kXMM1xI4uB4Aq4SafbtTz_lsgEag6GElQOCi9i&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fnews%2Fentertainment-arts-65248554.amp">succeeded</a> in having Twitter change its label to "publicly-funded" soon after a quickly-organized interview with Elon Musk, who said he agreed with the corporation's description of itself.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The CBC is a Crown corporation, which means it's completely owned by the Canadian government but editorially independent — the country's Broadcasting Act enshrines that hands-off approach in law. It also makes some of its money from advertising.</p><p>Attention to the issue in the US began in earnest when National Public Radio (NPR) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-removes-us-state-affiliated-media-label-from-npr-account-215742901.html">objected</a> to "US state-affiliated" media labelling.

NPR <a href="https://www.engadget.com/npr-is-ditching-twitter-over-government-funded-media-label-on-its-main-account-155556726.html">quit the platform</a> days later. The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) made a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pbs-has-also-quit-twitter-over-its-government-funded-media-label-164843803.html">similar move</a>, noting that most of its revenue comes from private sources.</p><p>The CBC's halt won't necessarily lead Twitter to change its label policy. However, it makes clear that the exodus is an international phenomenon.

## Google's Pixel 7a may cost $50 more than its predecessor

<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-7a-leak-video-90hz-smooth-display-185534569.html">rumored feature upgrades</a> for the Google Pixel 7a may prompt a price increase. A <em>9to5Google</em> retail source <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/04/17/pixel-7a-starts-499-may-11/">claims</a> the upcoming mid-range phone will cost $499, or $50 more than the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6a-review-battery-life-camera-samples-170025138.html">Pixel 6a</a>. That's not shocking given possible upgrades that include a 90Hz display, a 64MP main camera and wireless charging, but this is a far cry from the $350 of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-4a-review-price-specs-availability-150050960.html">Pixel 4a</a>.</p><p>Google is reportedly compensating for the hike by keeping the Pixel 6a on sale at a lower price. You may still get a budget phone, even if it's just last year's model. There's no word on Google extending software update support for the 6a, so we still wouldn't count on Android version upgrades past July 2025.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You may not have to wait as long for the Pixel 7a as you did for its ancestor. The same source says the new phone will be available in retail stores on May 11th. <em>Front Page Tech</em>'s Jon Prosser <a href="https://twitter.com/jon_prosser/status/1648008072327995401">says</a> the 7a would be available for immediate purchase on May 10th, but <em>9to5</em> believes it won't reach any customers until the following day. That's still better than for the 6a, which didn't ship until two months after its launch event.</p><p>If the report is accurate, the $499 price for the Pixel 7a won't thrill fans who've witnessed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-rtx-4070-review-the-new-1440p-gaming-leader-130010874.html">ballooning prices</a> elsewhere in the tech world.

## DOJ alleges China used a troll farm to target Chinese government critics in the US

<p>In an 89-page complaint <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/40-officers-china-s-national-police-charged-transnational-repression-schemes-targeting-us">unsealed on Monday</a>, the Justice Department alleges 34 current and former members of China’s 912 Special Project Working Group carried out a multi-year campaign to harass critics of Xi Jinping’s regime and discredit American policies. The task force, part of China’s domestic security agency, created thousands of fake social media profiles, including on Twitter and Facebook, to target Chinese dissidents in the US.</p><p>Judging from screenshots shared by the Justice Department, many of the profiles did not have more than a dozen accounts following them, but a common thread among them is that they tried to pass as authentic American voices. As <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2f007401-3eaa-4237-b69b-54ccbe125502&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Wall+Street+Journal&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyZjAwNzQwMS0zZWFhLTQyMzctYjY5Yi01NGNjYmUxMjU1MDIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9jaGluYS1zZWN1cml0eS11bml0LXRhcmdldGVkLXUtcy13aXRoLWZha2Utc29jaWFsLW1lZGlhLXNjaGVtZS1wcm9zZWN1dG9ycy1hbGxlZ2UtNTI3YjY1MjgiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjBjYjMxZGZlLTc3M2YtNGI0Yy1hNTZkLTJhN2MxNGRhNGFiNCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAa1vnIMD59z2t-fPMUMPcJx_DjrYCpghATRtrn3mUAja&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Fchina-security-unit-targeted-u-s-with-fake-social-media-scheme-prosecutors-allege-527b6528"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> points out, one account claimed to be “Susan Miller,” a woman from New York. Another said they were “Julie Torres,” a native of Wisconsin. According to the Justice Department, China’s Ministry of Public Security tracked the performance of the agents involved in the operation and rewarded those who successfully ran multiple online personas without being detected by Twitter and Facebook.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition to targeting Chinese dissidents, the group, taking a page from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-25-facebook-russian-meddling-obama-zuckerberg.html">Russia’s disinformation playbook</a>, sought to discredit the US government by exploiting divisions among the American public. For instance, it spread disinformation about George Floyd, the Black Man whose murder by Minneapolis police in 2020 sparked Black Lives Matter <a href="https://www.engadget.com/police-get-google-location-data-george-floyd-protests-183114536.html">protests across the country</a>. The group also amplified Russian propaganda about the war in Ukraine.</p><p>“As alleged, the PRC government deploys its national police and the 912 Special Project Working Group not as an instrument to uphold the law and protect public safety, but rather as a troll farm that attacks persons in our country for exercising free speech in a manner that the PRC government finds disagreeable, and also spreads propaganda whose sole purpose is to sow divisions within the United States,” said US attorney Breon Peace, referring to the acronym for the People’s Republic of China.</p><p>According to the Justice Department, all 34 of the agents remain at large.

## Starting tomorrow, only six EVs will still qualify for a $7,500 federal tax credit

<p>The IRS released a list of electric vehicles that still qualify for the full $7,500 federal tax credit after strict new guidelines, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/stricter-guidance-means-fewer-evs-will-qualify-for-7500-federal-tax-credit-180350889.html"><ins>announced back in March</ins></a>, officially go into effect on April 18th. The list is <em>very</em> short, as just six EVs now qualify under the new terms. The updated rules pertain to EV batteries and cut out China as an approved trading partner, so we knew the vehicle list would shrink, as most electric vehicles use batteries manufactured in China or by Chinese companies.</p><p>If you want to get that full tax credit, choose from the Cadillac Lyriq, Chevy Bolt, Chevy Bolt EUV, some Tesla Model 3 versions, some Tesla Model Y versions and Ford F-150 Lightning. Many EVs lose the full credit moving forward, like the Nissan Leaf and Volkswagen ID.4. So check the full list <a href="https://fueleconomy.gov/feg/tax2023.shtml"><ins>before zeroing in</ins></a> on your next car purchase. $7,500 is nothing to sneeze at.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>EVs shunted out of the exclusive full tax-credit club may still qualify for a half credit of $3,750, so long as they meet certain requirements. Three PHEVs also qualify for the half credit and three more qualify for the full tax credit, including models manufactured by Ford, Lincoln, Chrysler and Jeep. These credits are not about excluding hybrid technology and are all about making sure components are sourced properly.&nbsp;</p><p>Here's how that breaks down. Battery components that are 50 percent made or assembled in the USA qualify for the first half of $3,750 and if the company sources at least 40 percent of critical minerals from the US or free trade partners, the second $3,750 kicks in. If a company meets one or the other standard, the vehicle gets a half credit.</p><p>While the list winnowing down to just six vehicles makes for a good headline, it should beef up as automobile manufacturers make changes to meet the rules. New EVs that meet the component sourcing standards will get added to the list and other vehicles will get re-added as manufacturers open new factories in the US and other approved countries. New trade deals could also impact the list of approved vehicles as time marches forward. However, these rules grow stricter over time. Batteries must be completely made in North America by 2029 to continue to stay on the IRS’s good side and get that full $7,500 credit.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/starting-tomorrow-only-six-evs-will-still-qualify-for-a-7500-federal-tax-credit-185304414.html?src=rss

## Halo veteran Joseph Staten is making a AAA game for Netflix

<p>Former Halo scribe Joseph Staten has joined Netflix’s burgeoning gaming division. On Monday, Staten tweeted that he will serve as the creative director on a new AAA game and original intellectual property from the streaming giant. “In my work life, there’s nothing I love more than collaborating with others to build worlds filled with iconic characters, deep mysteries, and endless adventures,” Staten <a href="https://twitter.com/joestaten/status/1648000044719833088?s=20">wrote on Twitter</a>. &quot;So today, I'm thrilled to announce that I've joined Netflix Games as Creative Director for a brand-new AAA multiplatform game and original IP.

Before joining the tech giant in 2013, he worked as a writer and director of cinematics on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-closes-bungie-acquisition-playstation-studios-190623763.html">Bungie’s</a> first three Halo games. Staten later helped write and co-direct <em>Destiny</em>, but left the studio before the game’s release in 2014. Following his return to the Microsoft fold (Bungie was a Microsoft studio before it went independent in 2007), Staten worked as senior creative director on the Xbox Game Studios team for a number of years before <a href="https://www.engadget.com/halo-infinite-343-industries-halo-veteran-151631579.html">moving to 343 Industries</a> in 2020 to assist in the development of <em>Halo Infinite</em>. This past January, Microsoft reassigned Staten away from 343 at the same time it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/343-industries-says-halo-and-master-chief-are-here-to-stay-after-studio-hit-hard-by-microsoft-layoffs-203029094.html">cut “at least” 95 jobs</a> at the troubled developer.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>On Monday, Staten said the game he’s working on at Netflix would be a “multiplatform” release. To date, the company’s gaming strategy has primarily centered around obtaining mobile publishing rights to respected indie titles like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-into-the-breach-ios-android-mobile-exclusive-204020515.html"><em>Into the Breach</em></a> and <a href="https://www.terranil.com/"><em>Terra Nil</em></a>. Funding the development of a multiplatform AAA game is significantly more ambitious and, it should be noted, risky.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/halo-veteran-joseph-staten-is-making-a-aaa-game-for-netflix-173502368.html?src=rss

## Twitter will label tweets limited due to hate policy violations

<p>Twitter may have a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-donald-trump-unbanned-elon-musk-023043690.html">looser stance on bans</a> under Elon Musk, but it's still willing to flag content that runs afoul of its rules. The social network will <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2023/freedom-of-speech-not-reach-an-update-on-our-enforcement-philosophy">label</a> tweets it believes are violating its Hateful Conduct policy. You'll see a notice that Twitter is limiting the &quot;visibility&quot; of the problematic post with an opportunity to learn more.</p><p>The labels will cover more types of policy violations in the months ahead. Users can initially provide &quot;feedback&quot; on a label if they feel it was in error, but they'll have to wait until sometime in the future to formally appeal decisions. The company stresses that the labels only apply to individual tweets, not an entire account.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="03fdb16bc7214e49941f9c777fb95012"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">We’re adding more transparency to the enforcement actions we take on Tweets.

Theoretically, this prevents offensive speech from spreading without completely silencing users on the platform. It also promises greater transparency to address concerns of &quot;shadow bans&quot; that limit reach without someone's knowledge. Musk has lifted bans on a number of high-profile accounts, including former President Trump's, although it was willing to temporarily <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ye-twitter-account-suspended-again-111550704.html">suspend Ye</a> despite lifting a permanent ban in November.</p><p>The move might not please some.

## SEC charges crypto exchange Bittrex for violating US securities laws

<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission has charged Bittrex and former CEO William Shihara with operating an unregistered securities exchange. In a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-78"><ins>complaint filed on Monday</ins></a>, the SEC alleges the crypto exchange, once one of the largest in the US, earned at least $1.3 billion in revenue between 2017 and 2022 while offering the services of a broker, exchange and clearing agency. It did so without registering with the Commission, in violation of federal law, the SEC alleges.</p><p>Additionally, the SEC claims Bittrex “coordinated” with crypto issuers to delete “problematic statements” Shihara believed would prompt a regulator like the SEC to investigate the exchange. In one instance, the Commission states Shihara instructed a potential issuer to erase comments that referenced “price predictions” and “expectation of profit.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“Today’s action, yet again, makes plain that the crypto markets suffer from a lack of regulatory compliance, not a lack of regulatory clarity,” said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. “As alleged in our complaint, Bittrex and issuers that it worked with knew the rules that applied to them but went to great lengths to evade them by directing issuer-applicants to ‘scrub’ offering materials of information indicating that certain crypto assets were securities.”</p><p>As <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/04/17/crypto-exchange-bittrex-violated-federal-laws-sec-charges-in-lawsuit/"><em><ins>Coindesk</ins></em><ins> notes</ins></a>, Bittrex, <a href="https://twitter.com/BittrexExchange/status/1641879884682387457?s=20"><ins>citing “continued regulatory uncertainty,”</ins></a> announced last month it would exit the US market at the end of April.

## Spotify is dropping the paywall for some Gimlet podcasts

<p>Spotify started pouring a whole lot of money into the podcasting space in 2019, making headlines by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-06-spotify-podcast-king-anchor-gimlet-media.html"><ins>purchasing entire production studios</ins></a> and signing lucrative <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-joe-rogan-deal-value-podcast-205637664.html"><ins>exclusivity deals with Joe Rogan</ins></a>, among others. The intention was to draw in paying subscribers via desirable long-form content, but now that experiment may be winding down, as reports indicate that the streamer is dropping the paywall for a number of high-profile podcasts.</p><p>The impacted podcasts all come from Gimlet Media, a studio that Spotify purchased during its 2019 spending spree for $230 million, <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/04/16/2023/spotify-will-drop-paywall-for-gimlet-podcasts"><ins>as reported by </ins><em><ins>Semafor</ins></em></a>. Spotify confirmed this move but hasn't indicated which Gimlet podcasts are moving to a free-to-stream model, aside from the hit <em>Science Vs</em>. Gimlet produces podcasts like <em>Reply All, Crimetown</em> and <em>Surprisingly Awesome</em>. The company further partnered with the streaming giant to create a host of Spotify Originals like <em>How to Save a Planet</em> and <em>Motherhackers.</em></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This not only eliminates the subscription-based paywall for Spotify listeners but opens up podcasts to be shared on other platforms. The end result should be more choices for consumers.&nbsp;</p><p>“Given our position as the leading global podcast platform, we are expanding our windowing strategies to increase the audiences and ad sales potential of our shows,&quot; a spokesperson for Spotify told <em>Semafor</em>. &quot;In this case, we’re pursuing broad distribution for some of our original podcasts like <em>Science Vs.</em> This will be done on a case-by-case basis and over time.”</p><p>As indicated above, the reasoning here involves expanding ad sales. If a podcast is tied to one subscription-based platform, that narrows the listenership which, in turn, reduces the demand for ad placement. This move does not necessarily spell the end of podcasts as a driving force behind Spotify subscriptions, as the company already allowed some established Gimlet shows to be widely distributed after the 2019 acquisition. This could be just another experiment as Spotify looks for the perfect marriage between subscriber growth and ad revenue.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/spotify-is-dropping-the-paywall-for-some-gimlet-podcasts-162547473.html?src=rss

<p>After <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nike-blockchain-dot-swoosh-151611192.html">launching its .Swoosh web3 platform in November</a>, Nike is ready to unveil its first set of digital collectibles today. The company has announced the Our Force 1 (or OF1) series of &quot;virtual creations&quot; will be available to a select group with invitations on May 8th, while general access opens on May 10th. You can choose to buy one of two boxes — &quot;Classic Remix&quot; or &quot;New Wave,&quot; and each will cost you $19.82 either way. You'll have to have an account on the Swoosh website and have minted your ID to get one of these, though.&nbsp;</p><p>Now to be clear, these aren't actual shoes you'd be getting. You're paying for a digital box to start, and you won't know what design you got either. On an undisclosed date after May 10th, Nike will reveal all the OF1 boxes at the same time, though you'll have the option of not opening the box and leaving it as a virtual Schrodinger's cat situation. Swoosh members will be alerted when that day comes, and each box comes with a 3D file that you can use to, say, export to other platforms (if compatible) and more.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There are over 100,000 &quot;Nike Virtual Creations&quot; in the OF1 collection, and they're mostly based on the Air Force 1. If you picked a Classic Remix box, you'll get a &quot;favorite, classic archive AF1 released from 1982 to 2006&quot; or &quot;a more unique, custom AF1 with a nostalgic twist.&quot; Those who select New Wave will receive a &quot;classic archive from 2007 or later&quot; or &quot;an expressive, custom AF1 with a more futuristic twist.&quot; There are also four designs from the winners of the company's previous &quot;Your Force 1&quot; contest that are in the mix across both types of boxes.&nbsp;</p><p>Like Nike explained when it launched .Swoosh, these digital collectibles aren't just for online use. &quot;In the near future,&quot; the company said, it &quot;will introduce other new utilities and benefits... such as exclusive physical products or experiences.&quot;</p><p>Since its launch, .Swoosh has seen over 330,000 accounts created and on April 18th, about 106,453 members will be chosen at random to receive virtual posters via Airdrop. This will allow them early access to buying an OF1 box. Nike said its DEI and SC+I partners will be included in this Airdrop, along with &quot;those who participated in the #OurForce1 challenge and/or registered at our .Swoosh Session tour stops.&quot; If you're a major Nike fan and are willing to part with $20 for a digital collectible with the possibility that it might get you early access to future product drops, you can register at swoosh.nike to be eligible to buy an OF1 on May 10th. Only those who have already minted their IDs before April 12th will be considered for early access.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/nike-launches-our-force-1-collection-of-digital-shoes-with-real-world-perks-160030487.html?src=rss

## VW's ID.7 electric sedan offers a WLTP range of 435 miles

<p>VW has finally <a href="https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/press-releases/world-premiere-for-the-efficiency-champion-volkswagen-id7-with-a-range-of-up-to-700-km-wltp-15735">revealed</a> its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volkswagen-unveils-its-upcoming-id-7-ev-sedan-at-ces-2023-005913547.html">ID.7 sedan</a> in earnest, and it's clear long-distance driving is the main draw. The &quot;upper mid-size&quot; electric car combines a new, more powerful and efficient 210kW (282HP) motor with an optional 86kWh battery and a highly aerodynamic design (the drag coefficient is 0.23) to deliver a claimed 435 miles of range on the WLTP test cycle. We'd expect more conservative numbers from US regulators (WLTP tends to be 22 percent higher), but this might just rival some <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-eqs-ev-review-video-150001883.html">Mercedes EQS models</a> at a lower price. It's certainly longer than the 275-mile EPA range of the ID.4.</p><p>This also represents VW's first significant shakeup of its interior design and technology since launching the ID line.  The ID.7 includes an augmented reality heads-up display, a 15-inch infotainment display and interface changes like a new air conditioning system and customizable favorites buttons. You can use an &quot;Ida&quot; voice assistant to control a number of cabin features, such as a sunroof with smart glass. A 14-speaker Harman Kardon sound system and adaptive climate control seats (a first in a VW) also make this the brand's most luxurious EV to date.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="75db290f02d644258a10d774b91400c7"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>As with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vw-unveils-second-gen-id3-ev-and-an-app-store-for-its-cars-154817061.html">revamped ID.3</a>, the ID.7 offers a number of driver aids. Travel Assist can use crowdsourced data to help navigation even on backroads, and performs highway lane changes. You can also have the car park itself, even if you're standing outside.</p><p>VW hasn't divulged pricing for the ID.7. It goes on sale in Europe and China in fall 2023, while North American buyers will have to wait until sometime in 2024. The EV may be a tough sell in North America, where <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vw-2023-id4-pricing-release-date-165237007.html">crossovers</a> and SUVs dominate. However, the range may help its chances. It's difficult to find this kind of endurance in any EV outside of higher-end luxury options.  It may be worth choosing if you're determined to minimize charging stops during a long-distance jaunt and aren't concerned about trunk space.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/vws-id7-electric-sedan-offers-a-wltp-range-of-435-miles-155138752.html?src=rss

<p>My dad bought me <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9CcmV2aWxsZS1KRTk4WEwtRm91bnRhaW4tODUwLVdhdHQtRXh0cmFjdG9yL2RwL0IwMDNSMjhIV1E_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tdDUtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjNhMTdhNjk2LThmYzYtNDRiZi1iMzdlLWU2YTAzMjY5YTc3OSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAWZ218kd2c8KRy_Yn4OTpTWbF0I1q5OfioHKxZTmTn_c&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBreville-JE98XL-Fountain-850-Watt-Extractor%2Fdp%2FB003R28HWQ">Breville’s Juice Fountain</a> for a very specific purpose: to recreate the <a href="https://highwest.com/blogs/recipes/horses-neck">horse’s neck</a> cocktail he’d enjoyed on a snowy evening at the High West distillery saloon in Utah. The drink calls for a quarter ounce of ginger juice, and if you’ve ever seen a knotty clump of said root, it doesn’t look like it would contain much liquid. That’s where the Fountain comes in – it extracts a waterfall from seemingly parched produce like it’s squishing grapes.</p><p>I make ginger juice in bigger batches, getting about five liquid ounces from eight ounces of ginger. Weight-to-volume conversions aside, that’s a pretty great ratio. It lasts a week or two in the fridge, so I can get a lot of horse’s necks out of a juicing session. The cocktail itself is bright, warming and spicy – and possibly my favorite tipple.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But I’m not drinking as much these days, so I’ve been using the Juice Fountain for healthier stuff that doesn't have bourbon in it… like straight juice. At first, I turned to the internet for recipes, but pretty quickly learned that throwing in whatever sounds good tends to have the best results. Carrot, ginger, lemon and orange together make something sweet and zesty that tastes and looks like a sunrise. Apple, kale, celery and lemon make a vivid green drink that reminds me of spring and feels like you’re drinking a cup of vitamins — if a cup of vitamins were delicious.</p><figure><img alt="A pitcher and two cups sit on a brown wooden table outside. They are filled with green juice made from kale, apples and celery.

Besides picking a speed, the only prep you need to do is to wash all ingredients and remove the peel and pith on citrus — no need to scrape the skin off ginger or remove the stalks from kale. Apples can even go in whole, as long as they fit down the impressively wide chute (though I usually core mine, out of an irrational <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=45b896c8-3f7d-467d-9411-dc0afcbc5afd&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Encyclop%C3%A6dia+Britannica&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0NWI4OTZjOC0zZjdkLTQ2N2QtOTQxMS1kYzBhZmNiYzVhZmQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnJpdGFubmljYS5jb20vc3RvcnkvY2FuLWFwcGxlLXNlZWRzLWtpbGwteW91IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzYTE3YTY5Ni04ZmM2LTQ0YmYtYjM3ZS1lNmEwMzI2OWE3NzkifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAaht-To-gmsYc1wvb5IT0oiu5yIB58sCshkcprdZUNhU&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.britannica.com%2Fstory%2Fcan-apple-seeds-kill-you">cyanide</a> paranoia).</p><p>Once the fruits and vegetables go in, the Fountain transforms them into juice in seconds, absolutely obliterating them with what I can only assume is a tiny jet-engine. Seriously, it sounds like an aircraft readying itself for takeoff; this is a daylight hours-only kind of machine. The motor is so powerful and the mesh/graters so robust that just the weight of a carrot or cucumber itself is usually enough to run it through the extractor. Even leafy kale only needs a light push from the plunger.</p><p>So yes, it does a great job of getting the most out of each piece of produce, but juicing still isn’t cheap. A big bunch of organic carrots and a few oranges quickly turn into a lovely neon drink, but there might be $6 worth of produce swimming in that cup. But hey, if it means my kid will drink eight ounces of a kelly green apple/kale concoction and ask for more, it’s worth it in my book.</p><p>When I first saw it, I was convinced the Fountain would be something I’d use once and never again after the tedium of washing its various intricate parts. And it does break down into quite a few pieces (seven to be exact), but taking it apart and putting it back together is completely intuitive. I don’t think I looked at the instructions since the first disassembly.</p><p>Cleaning the components isn’t hard either – as long as you do it immediately. If you wait until the pulp bits and juice spray have hardened, you’ll have to put in some muscle and fuss to get it sparkly again. The hardest part to wash is probably the mesh-and-grate extraction basket. Breville supplies a scrub brush for the job, but I promptly lost that. Turns out a standard dish brush and warm, soapy water do a great job of removing apple, carrot and all other remnants. A few of the parts are dishwasher safe, but others aren’t. I figure if I have to hand-wash some, I may as well do them all.</p><figure><img alt="The Breville juice fountain plus sits on a countertop. It has just been used to make an orange drink from carrots and oranges. Lots of pulp covers the inner dome of the juicer.

Liquid health pours from one side of the machine, but a pile of fluffy plant matter kicks out the other. The first time I saw it I had to wonder what the heck I was supposed to do with all of that. I tried a few muffin recipes that call for juicer pulp, but they didn’t turn out well. (I blame my baking skills, not the directions.) I still believe I’ll find something that works, but I have to experiment more.</p><p>So far, my favorite solution is adding the fluff to my weekly batch of breakfast smoothies. My advice if you do the same: don’t include any ginger pulp – if you do, it’ll be the only thing you taste. Citrus leftovers are also pretty overbearing and bitter. Fluff from apple, celery and carrots have the most neutral flavor and go nicely in a morning shake. Of course, I still always have way more byproduct than I could possibly use, so I just compost the rest.</p><p>At <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c0ca87c7-692e-4b52-8410-9ea74ef1a5a6&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Breville&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjMGNhODdjNy02OTJlLTRiNTItODQxMC05ZWE3NGVmMWE1YTYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnJldmlsbGUuY29tL3VzL2VuL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2p1aWNlcnMvYmplOTguaHRtbD9za3U9SkU5OFhMIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIzYTE3YTY5Ni04ZmM2LTQ0YmYtYjM3ZS1lNmEwMzI2OWE3NzkifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAaCA64E8jyO_obo3uLpAMN2QLcV1AZJ3Ewn3McAN6k4k&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.breville.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fproducts%2Fjuicers%2Fbje98.html%3Fsku%3DJE98XL">$180</a>, it’s not the cheapest kitchen appliance you can buy, but it’s far from the most expensive. Even though mine was a gift, I feel like it’s worth its price tag. Design-wise, the Fountain follows the silvery, matte aesthetic Breville tends to give its kitchen appliances, a look that’s neither too modern or overly retro. It has lovely curves and a graceful, tower-like profile. But thanks to the aforementioned jet engine, the Fountain isn’t small. My tiny kitchen has no space to store it on the countertop, so when it’s not doing its juice thing, it lives up in a cupboard. Honestly, it’s a pain to get down. But I’m happy (and healthier) every time I do.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/breville-juice-fountain-plus-irl-150059913.html?src=rss

<p>Mercedes has a history of building wonderful luxury vehicles, so much so that the S-Class may as well be the official car of CEOs being driven around town. Yet, Mercedes aims higher with the Maybach lineup, taking the S-Class and kicking it up a notch. (If you watch the HBO drama <em>Succession</em>, you’ve likely seen a Maybach ferrying the patriarch Logan Roy as he destroys the will of his children.)&nbsp;</p><p>Today, Mercedes is giving its EQS SUV the Maybach treatment. The EQS 680 SUV Maybach takes the electric Mercedes and fills it with all the opulence found in other Maybachs to create a luxury car that is a bit kinder to the environment. We got a chance to see the vehicle ahead of today’s unveiling. It has everything you’d expect from a Maybach, from the two-tone paint job through to a fridge for bubbly and specially-built cup holders for champagne flutes.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Mercedes isn't letting anyone drive the EQS SUV Maybach yet, and it also doesn’t have an EPA range estimate or battery capacity to share. But if you’re riding in the back of this SUV, that’s really none of your concern. Check out our video to see just how lavish an electric Maybach can be.</p><div id="3a828b9e22254ff3a90c5db20ebb0e2c"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-eqs-680-suv-maybach-is-all-about-back-seat-luxury-140031158.html?src=rss

## How to make the most of that Instant Pot you just bought
 - [https://www.engadget.com/instant-pot-guide-131534709.html?src=rss](https://www.engadget.com/instant-pot-guide-131534709.html?src=rss)

<p>The Instant Pot is one of those rare kitchen appliances to reach not just cult status, but broad mainstream appeal. An “all-in-one” multicooker that promises to replace a rice cooker, a yogurt maker, a slow cooker and more, the Instant Pot has risen to fame in part thanks to its versatility and also the fact that it’s a good electric pressure cooker. This lets you cook food at an accelerated rate — think pulled pork in an hour, or chicken curry done in 10 minutes. And because it’s electric, you just press a few buttons and walk away without having to keep an eye on it.</p><p>It’s no wonder why the Instant Pot has become a favorite among home cooks, even those of us on the Engadget staff. Not only have a few of us <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-23-gadget-irl-instant-pot-ultra-huel-sleep-cycle.html">bought it for ourselves</a>, we've recommended it in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-gifts-for-new-grads-who-need-help-adulting-124547404.html">past gift guides</a>. Sure, it's not a gadget in the traditional sense (although there is <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9JbnN0YW50LVBvdC02UXQtUGx1cy1XaUZpL2RwL0IwOFRNVEpaOEw_dGg9MSZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby10Ni0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMmY5YzkzZjAtZTc4OC0zMGM1LThjYTktZTgyNzBmN2IzNmIwIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAWtU9iGrCZStSfctLDbCpeIQg_07RS9391WWpRWNm2C7&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FInstant-Pot-6Qt-Plus-WiFi%2Fdp%2FB08TMTJZ8L%3Fth%3D1">a WiFi-connected version with an ap</a>p), but it does have a lot of crossover appeal thanks to its promise of all-in-one efficiency.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But what do you do when you get one? With so many recipes on the internet and so many different things you can do with it, where do you even start? In this guide, I'll attempt to give you a primer on the first steps you should take when you get one, some tips and tricks on how to use it and a few favorite recipes and source links. A lot of this comes from personal experience; I've been an Instant Pot owner for a few years. I'll also note that the listed recipes reflect my own taste, but hopefully this guide will provide a good start for your own culinary adventures.</p><h2>How Instant Pots work</h2><figure><img alt="Should you own multiple Instant Pots?

And because it's electric, you just press a few buttons and walk away.

Setup is as easy as putting the inner pot inside the housing and plugging it in. You'll also want to attach the tiny condensation collector on the back if the instructions call for it.</p><p>The first thing to do is a "water test," which not only helps familiarize you with the basic pressure cooker features, but confirms your appliance is in proper working order. To do this, put three cups of water in the pot, twist the lid on — it'll make a sound when it's locked in place — and set the pressure cooker on high for two minutes. The way to do this varies from model to model; on the Duo machines, you'll have to press Manual, select High, then dial down the time to two minutes. On something like the Ultra, you just need to go to the Pressure Cooker menu, dial it to two minutes and select High.</p><figure><img alt="Instant Pot Super Bowl cookoff" src="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dimse/5845cadfecd996e0372f/e787f3868a7c379692bf434ad7bff8c901c0bf53/Y3JvcD0zMDAwJTJDMTk2MiUyQzAlMkMwJnF1YWxpdHk9ODUmZm9ybWF0PWpwZyZyZXNpemU9MTYwMCUyQzEwNDYmaW1hZ2VfdXJpPWh0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGcy55aW1nLmNvbSUyRm9zJTJGY3JlYXRyLWltYWdlcyUyRjIwMTgtMTElMkZjMDJmMzY5MC1lYzE4LTExZTgtOGNmYS1mYTRlOTM0MWYyMjUmY2xpZW50PWExYWNhYzNlMWIzMjkwOTE3ZDkyJnNpZ25hdHVyZT1iMzE5YjBiZmEzNDhjZGNjZDIwZWExNzYyYjY2NTkxNGZiNmMwMDgw" /><figcaption><div class="photo-credit"></div></figcaption></figure><p>Then, make sure your valve is set to "Sealing" so that the Instant Pot can build pressure. On the Duo machines, this means rotating it so the arrow points up, while on the Ultra, the valve will automatically be set to Sealing. Finally, press "Start." The Instant Pot will then build up that pressure to High, maintain it for the set two minutes, and then stop. In some cases, you'll hear hissing and see steam coming out of the Instant Pot. This is totally normal. You'll know the Instant Pot is under pressure when the float valve pops up and the hissing quiets down.</p><p>The lid cannot be opened when the Instant Pot is under pressure; you must depressurize it first. Once the cooking is done, you can let the pot naturally depressurize (also known as "Natural Release"), which simply means leaving it alone for 20 or so minutes until the float valve comes down.If you don’t want to wait that long, you can do a manual release (also known as "Quick Release") by switching the valve to "Venting." To do that on the Duo models you rotate the valve; on the Ultra, press the steam release button on top. This method will release a lot of steam, so I suggest doing this under a range hood if you have one. Again, once the float valve comes back down, you'll know the Instant Pot has been depressurized.</p><p>Doing the water test teaches you the basics of sealing the Instant Pot, setting it and depressurizing it. Plus, if anything goes wrong along the way — especially if it doesn't seal the pressure — you can call the retailer or manufacturer to troubleshoot or ask about a return or exchange. It's a step that many people skip, but I recommend it for beginners.</p><h2>Instant Pot accessories</h2><p>The Instant Pot is ready to use right out of the box, but if you want to get even more functionality out of it, then you might want to consider some accessories. The following are just a few suggestions that we think will elevate your Instant Pot experience.</p><figure><img alt="Instant Pot accessories" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/c15f01d0-e2f7-11ea-9ae7-30869688d118" /><figcaption><div class="photo-credit"></div></figcaption></figure><h3>Tempered glass lid</h3><p>The main reason to get an Instant Pot is to use it as a pressure cooker, but it has other functions too.

It’s a good option if you don’t want two appliances taking up space on your kitchen counter, and this add-on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-12-instant-pot-air-fryer-lid-accessory.html">does a decent job of “air frying” foods</a>. Still, the Lid really only works for small batches as well as smaller pieces of food. Even a hot dog is too large to fit inside the air fryer basket.</p><p>If you’re going to use the air fryer lid to add roasting and broiling capabilities to the Instant Pot — so you can brown a roast chicken or melt the cheese on a lasagna, for example — then it’s not a bad option. But as far as air frying goes, I’d recommend saving up and investing in an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-air-fryers-133047180.html">actual air fryer</a> instead.</p><h2>Tips and tricks</h2><h3>Don't worry about all the buttons</h3><p>When you first get the Instant Pot, you might be overwhelmed by all of the different buttons on the front of it. There are ones that say "Meat/Stew," "Chili/Beans," "Multigrain," "Egg" and even "Cake." With the exception of a few, most of these are simply shortcuts that Instant Pot programmed ahead of time. You might never need to use them.</p><p>The most important buttons to know are "Sauté," which (as you might expect) lets you sauté things in the pot, and the aforementioned "Manual" or "Pressure Cooker" function. The rest are pretty superfluous, with the exception of "Keep Warm," "Cancel" and non-pressure cooker functions like the "Slow Cooker" or "Yogurt" (which helps maintain the cultured milk at a specific temperature).</p><figure><img alt="Instant Pot with Air Fryer Lid" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/8da1f630-e2f8-11ea-bd7e-854a192ce848" /><figcaption><div class="photo-credit"></div></figcaption></figure><h3>Add at least half a cup of liquid, and don't go over the maximum</h3><p>One of the things you'll learn about pressure cooking is that you don't need to add as much liquid as you would in regular recipes. But you'll still need to add some because the pressure cooker requires moisture to build that pressure. Otherwise, the Instant Pot could overheat and show an "OvHT" or “BURN” error on the display. On the other hand, you shouldn't fill it up beyond two-thirds capacity, which is handily marked on the inside of the inner pot. The Instant Pot probably won't explode on you — it has a lot of safety features to prevent that — but you probably shouldn't test its boundaries.</p><h3>Cooking times aren't always accurate</h3><p>Setting the pressure cooker timer for two minutes doesn't mean the entire cooking time is two minutes. You have to take into account the amount of time the Instant Pot needs to come to pressure and the time it'll need to depressurize. The more stuff you have in the pot (and the colder it is), the longer it takes. Because of that, a "five-minute" chicken curry could really be more like 10 or 15 minutes from start to finish.</p><h3>Clean it carefully and frequently</h3><p>The inner pot is dishwasher safe, which is convenient, but the rest has to be cleaned by hand. Also, don't make the same mistake I did and accidentally spill something hot directly on the cooking element. The outer shell is hard to clean because you can't put it in the sink — electricity and water don't mix, after all — and you risk damaging the appliance. As for the lid, hand wash it after every use. You'll also notice after a while that the sealing ring — the rubber/silicone gasket on the inside of the lid — might develop a smell as it absorbs the scent of the food you're cooking. I recommend soaking it in a vinegar solution, or you could also put it on the top rack of your dishwasher.</p><h3>You can't cook everything with it</h3><p>Sure, you can cook everything from dog food to jam in the Instant Pot, but it's not a miracle worker. You can't deep fry in it. You can't bake a pie in it. Don't be ridiculous.</p><h2>Recipes and guides</h2><figure><img alt="This is a wide angle photograph of an African American father in his 40s preparing food for cooking dinner with his 17 year old daughter in their home kitchen in Miami, Florida." src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/d6e85aa0-e2f8-11ea-bedf-198e4fcf3257" /><figcaption><div class="photo-credit"></div></figcaption></figure><p>Now you're all ready to cook, and you're probably dying to know what to make in it. Due to the popularity of the Instant Pot, you'll find no shortage of cookbooks and recipe tutorials online. The Facebook group I mentioned is a good place to start, and there are countless YouTube tutorials as well. Here are just a few of my favorite resources:</p><h3><a href="https://www.pressurecookrecipes.com/how-to-use-instant-pot/">Pressure Cook Recipes</a></h3><p>Amy and Jacky are part of the OG Instant Pot community, and their site is great for beginners. Not only will you get the low-down on the aforementioned water test, but you'll also get great recipes for bone broth, "fail-proof" rice, yogurt, cheesecake and more.</p><h3><a href="https://nomnompaleo.com/post/125878339293/my-top-paleo-pressure-cookerinstant-pot-recipes">Nom Nom Paleo</a></h3><p>Whether or not you're into the "paleo" lifestyle, you'll like Michelle Tam's list of Instant Pot recipes. Pressure cookers are great for shortening the amount of time for cooking braised meats, and she has a lot of recipes that cater to your inner carnivore. Her Instant Pot pulled pork recipe is still my go-to, and the short ribs are great as well.</p><h3><a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/roundups/pressure-cooker-recipes">Serious Eats</a></h3><p>My personal favorite site for pressure-cooker recipes is probably Serious Eats. All of these recipes are fantastic. I've tried the chicken stock, the mushroom risotto, the chicken pho, the chicken and chickpea masala, and they've all been outstanding.</p><h3><a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/68861692-nyt-cooking/4441089-24-recipes-to-make-in-your-instant-pot-or-pressure-cooker">The New York Times</a></h3><p>Another personal favorite is <em>The New York Times</em>’ Cooking section, which has a list of wonderful pressure-cooker-friendly recipes. My favorites are from Melissa Clark, who has written two Instant Pot cookbooks: <a href="https://amzn.to/3wcI2zC"><em>Dinner In an Instant</em></a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/3wifxAm"><em>Comfort in an Instant</em></a>. There's a recipe in <em>Comfort in an Instant</em> for spaghetti and meatballs that I was hugely skeptical of but turned out to be one of the most remarkable things I've ever made. I also love the recipes for chicken korma and shrimp biryani.</p><h2>Other sources</h2><p>Here are a few other guides that I found very useful in my own Instant Pot journey, and they contain links to many more recipes and sites than I have space for here:</p><ul><li><p><a href="http://mrgan.com/ip/">Neven Mrgan's Instant Pot guide</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/instant-pot-starter-guide/">The Instant Pot Starter Guide from 101 Cookbooks</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/50-recipes-that-you-can-make-in-your-instant-pot-233637">75+ recipes to make in your Instant Pot by thekitchn</a></p></li></ul><p>With all of this information in your arsenal, you should have no fear in picking up an Instant Pot. Thankfully, not only is the base model pretty affordable at less than $100, Amazon frequently puts it on sale either on Prime Day or on Black Friday. So if you haven't bought one just yet, it's not a bad idea to wait until one of those times of year to get one at a deep discount. And when you do, come on back here, read through the guide once more and venture off on your own pressure-filled culinary adventures.</p><p>Images: Detroit Free Press via Getty Images (First Instapot); Portland Press Herald via Getty Images (Instapot / chopping board); Boogich via Getty Images (cooking)</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/instant-pot-guide-131534709.html?src=rss

The additions should be coming to Firefly's beta program later this year.</p><p>Built from the company's long-running AI program, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=7247b01c-2a32-4141-aac1-4e4bb8170ec0&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Rite+Aid&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI3MjQ3YjAxYy0yYTMyLTQxNDEtYWFjMS00ZTRiYjgxNzBlYzAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWRvYmUuY29tL3NlbnNlaS5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmMjEzYWQzNS1lYTE5LTRmMTItYjU3Yy01NTdlZDY2ZmY1MmQifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAer3FYTx5ElHURjGhXt8FDDb7A9c8b4Dy5vOQfK-ZVh7&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adobe.com%2Fsensei.html">Sensei</a>, Firefly is a suite of generative AI models that can both create and transform audio, video, illustrations and 3D models using text prompts in the same way that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-brings-dall-es-ai-image-generation-to-bing-and-edge-152749735.html">Dall-E</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/what-do-ai-chatbots-know-about-us-and-who-are-they-sharing-it-with-140013949.html">ChatGPT</a> do. Firefly's features are already available across Adobe's ecosystem including Premiere Pro, Illustrator, After Effects and Photoshop, though they're currently only accessible through the closed beta program.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The new features announced Monday are designed to help professional editors cut down on their drudge work, boosting color levels, inserting placeholder images, adding effects, autonomously recommending b-roll for a given project — simply by typing their ideas into Firefly's AI text prompt and letting the algorithm do its thing. This will include "text to color enhancements," a broad-ranging capability that can adjust the brightness and saturation levels, shift the time of day — even the time of <em>year</em> — using natural language prompts.&nbsp;</p><p>The generative AI features will extend to audio as well, with the capacity to insert background music and sound effects by describing the editor what they want through text. The animated font features that we first glimpsed at last month's debut event are expected to arrive shortly as well as an automated b-roll feature that analyzes the content of the script to generate storyboards and suggest video clips. Most impressive, Firefly will even throw together personalized how-to guides to walk new users through the process of using these features.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/adobe-fireflys-new-ai-tools-aim-to-cut-down-drudge-work-for-editors-130005412.html?src=rss

## How this non-gamer fell in love with ‘The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild’

<p>It was after a particularly grueling session with <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> that I started to wonder: When did developers stop putting cheats into their games to help the less talented among us get through the tricky bits? When I was a kid, a little bit of Up Down Left Right A and Start together, and a little older, a little /~noclip saved me no end of bother. These days, if you look for cheats for any modern game online, the best you’ll get is to be sassily told to “git gud.”</p><p>Sorry, a little context: I play games, but I’m not a Gamer, or a Nintendo Person, so in 2023 I resolved to remedy this. So many discussions at work fly past me because while I’ve heard of Cliff Bleszinski and Hironobu Sakaguchi, I couldn’t tell you their oeuvre without Googling. Part of my self-education was to watch every Zero Punctuation compilation to speedrun the last decade of games development. Another part was to seek out some classic games that I’d never played through ignorance, weakness, or my own stupid fault.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The first step on this journey only required me to go to the bookshelves in my living room, ironically. I bought my <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-07-28-im-addicted-to-pokemon-go.html"><em>Pokémon Go</em></a>-loving wife a Nintendo Switch at the start of 2020 so she could play<em> Let’s Go Pikachu!</em>. Not long after, a friend handed me their copy of Breath of the Wild and said I should give it a play. But it’s been sitting on my bookshelf for three years, as I subconsciously resisted the urge to give it a go. This, I’ll admit, is because I’ve always had the notion that Nintendo games are Hard Work.</p><p>And that was my belief up until a month ago, when I thought I’d better try <em>Breath of the Wild </em>before <a href="https://www.engadget.com/watch-10-minutes-of-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-gameplay-145613610.html"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a> came out. I figured I’d give it half an hour, the smallest of toes dipped into the world, so that I could say I’d tried and that it wasn’t for me. And before you can say “I need to be up at seven in the morning for work,” it was long past midnight. Since then, <em>Breath of the Wild </em>has consumed my every waking moment. It is, without a doubt, one of the most engrossing and immersive games I have ever played, despite my frustrations.</p><figure><img alt="Image of Link from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild running away from a static guardian." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/d7758cc0-d84d-11ed-bdbf-ff90f071a3c1" style="height: 1080px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nintendo</div></figure><p>It’s why I felt compelled to write this, because I want to spread the gospel to non-gamers who might feel similarly like they’ve missed the bus. Especially since we can hope that the older game might <a href="https://www.dekudeals.com/items/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">fall in price</a> as people seek out its replacement. Or, given the current situation with Nintendo persistently keeping the prices of its older first-party games high, at least it <em>won’t get any more expensive</em>. But, to undermine my own argument, I’d say that if <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> is half as good as <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, it’ll probably be the first game that’s worth the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9MZWdlbmQtWmVsZGEtQnJlYXRoLVdpbGQtTmludGVuZG8tU3dpdGNoL2RwL0IwOTdCMllXRlgvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXN3LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3Y2FiYmY4MS02M2UxLTQ3ZGUtOGZkMi01MDg2YjhjM2IwZjUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUgyC4kAEDtJ4N5oMg6Wcvb4TOaOsELp_HHjdbCyeJBs&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLegend-Zelda-Breath-Wild-Nintendo-Switch%2Fdp%2FB097B2YWFX%2F">$70</a> fee Nintendo’s trying to push consumers into accepting.</p><p>Despite its age (it is from 2017, after all), <em>Breath of the Wild</em> feels cutting-edge, and part of that is how deep it is. When I started playing, I worried that it would be yet another soulless open-world grind-a-thon, a feeling not soothed by the presence of <em>Far Cry</em>-esque towers you need to conquer to open up areas of the map. But the one thing that this game has that sets it apart from its genre-mates is a level of curation that continues to surprise me.</p><p>It plays out on a sprawling map, but it never feels like you’re traversing through an empty void. The density of what’s available means that, despite spending a month or so covering just half of Hyrule (I’ve only recently reached Goron City), I never stop finding new stuff. And there are some assets that have been reused, like the standard template for enemy camps, but you never feel that they’ve been copy-pasted to pad out the space. This Hyrule feels hand-made, with every detail sweated beyond any player’s comprehension.</p><p>Even a philistine like me can appreciate the level of craft, not just in its layout, but how it has been built. Take the chemistry engine, which seems like such a simple idea you wonder why it hasn’t been a part of open worlds forever. By giving each material its own properties, you can take advantage of more than just weight physics to help you solve puzzles. Thanks to YouTube, once I understood how Shock Traps worked, I was able to start making real progress in the shrine quests that put you face to face with a particularly murderous killbot.</p><p>And the game’s critical path is left so completely wide open as to almost not matter at all, giving you total freedom. Rather than giving you a set series of missions, you unlock the main quest line after the first hour, and then can tackle it in any way you wish. I’ve seen more than a few <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=89f68c82-f255-44fa-8db9-03fec996b93a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YouTube&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4OWY2OGM4Mi1mMjU1LTQ0ZmEtOGRiOS0wM2ZlYzk5NmI5M2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1wVlpqeHJwR0FzMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiN2NhYmJmODEtNjNlMS00N2RlLThmZDItNTA4NmI4YzNiMGY1In0&amp;signature=AQAAAZH9CR1TYYRl9OVpq_V8KwBaOLfU5ydFzMnXjUmY60Vd&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DpVZjxrpGAs0">Straight To Ganon</a> speed runs where expert players take a bare-footed Link to defeat the title’s big bad within minutes of being able to leave the tutorial area. I love, too, how the landscape gently nudges you toward the safer areas where you can level up before you’re let loose on the harsher climates of, say, Death Mountain.</p><figure><img alt="Image of Link using Stasis power in 'Breath of the Wild' " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/fe0fe790-d84d-11ed-8fbf-d5a8455afffa" style="height: 1080px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nintendo</div></figure><p>This works so well that when you’ve gotten a little way along you start picking up weapons that aren’t total garbage. Recently, I was cornered by a Guardian Stalker, very much a one-hit kill villain you can only ever hope of running out of view from. But, trapped in the North Lomei Labyrinth, I had no option but to try and fight without dying. And I managed to hack off its legs, one by one, until it flopped on its side, unable to shoot me with its laser. The feeling of exhilaration and satisfaction after so many deaths, was one for the ages. You don’t need to git gud in the grindy sense, you just need to spend enough time in the world to gently, naturally evolve how you play the game until things get easy.</p><p>And this is when I realized there was a good reason developers don’t put cheats into their games any more. Because a good title, like <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, rarely prescribes how you navigate and solve its world. If you’re not a fighter, you can devote your energies to stealthily circumnavigating your foes. When you grasp the game’s physics engine, you can use a well-placed remote bomb to send a venom-spitting Lizalfo hurtling down the side of a cliff. The only thing I can’t do yet is take on a Lynel – the game’s super-tough mini-boss – and not get rinsed, because I’m not sure I’ll ever learn the art of parrying.</p><p>Now, that may be deficiency enough that I never actually finish the game, since that’s rarely an impediment to getting to the fun bits. Take the shrine quests, which (mostly) offer the most enjoyable physics puzzles since <em>Portal, </em>give or take the aforementioned combat trials. Part of this is because the puzzles can be hard but are never unfairly-formatted, and there’s almost always a solution that’ll come to mind if you just walk around for long enough. The fact there’s no time limit or villain trying to force you to hurry up helps matters considerably.</p><p>I have gripes, but they’re all mostly nitpicks. The Switch’s hardware limitations means that the game’s draw distance can sometimes be a problem. If you’re looking for a spot out of sight of enemies to land your glider on, it can only be once you’re inches from the ground that it’ll finally render a camouflaged Lizalfo. And Nintendo’s policy of never being entirely open with the player to encourage experimentation means you’ll need to have some YouTube tutorial channels bookmarked to help you navigate some of the more baffling bits.</p><p>Simon Parkin’s essay about <em>Breath of the Wild</em> in <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2c74dc58-9aed-4251-a9fd-8b3521347943&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+Yorker&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyYzc0ZGM1OC05YWVkLTQyNTEtYTlmZC04YjM1MjEzNDc5NDMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3eW9ya2VyLmNvbS90ZWNoL2FubmFscy1vZi10ZWNobm9sb2d5L3RoZS1kYXp6bGluZy1yZWludmVudGlvbi1vZi16ZWxkYSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiN2NhYmJmODEtNjNlMS00N2RlLThmZDItNTA4NmI4YzNiMGY1In0&amp;signature=AQAAASk5se3-fSWsbEcPZDqNgnzoiRwfDAXIbdCDkUWdDkg3&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Ftech%2Fannals-of-technology%2Fthe-dazzling-reinvention-of-zelda"><em>The New Yorker</em></a> quoted original series creator Shigeru Miyamoto, who described Hyrule as a “miniature garden you can put into a drawer and revisit any time you like.” And this speaks to something I’ve found about the game, that it’s less of a video game and more of a place that you can choose to visit. This vast, pastoral paradise, which you can roam around on foot, climbing mountains or on horseback. A land only spoiled by the regular appearance of a zombified enemy crawling up out of the ground to ruin your reverie.</p><p>In a way, as much as I enjoyed having <a href="https://www.engadget.com/no-mans-sky-return-irl-143033861.html"><em>No Man’s Sky</em></a> as my lockdown game of 2020, I wish I’d been braver and tried Zelda back then.

The streaming service soon tweeted an apology: &quot;To everyone who stayed up late, woke up early, gave up their Sunday afternoon… we are incredibly sorry that the <em>Love Is Blind</em> Live Reunion did not turn out as we had planned.

<p>Accused of leaking classified documents, Jack Teixeira was charged after a quick investigation focused on his digital trail. <em>The New York Times</em>' investigative journalism team identified Teixeira by finding an Instagram account mentioned in his Steam profile. That, in turn, showed photos of the granite kitchen countertop and floor tiles visible in the leaks. The suspect hasn't yet entered a plea and will face a hearing on April 19th. The charges against him carry a maximum combined sentence of up to 15 years in prison.</p><p>Teixeira allegedly began sharing the documents on a <em>Minecraft</em>-oriented Discord server in late 2022. He supposedly didn't intend to act as a whistleblower, but the content eventually spread to other Discord servers as well as 4chan and Telegram.</p><p>– Mat Smith</p><p><em>The Morning After isn’t just a</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/"><em> newsletter</em></a><em> –  it’s also a daily podcast.

<p><a href="https://investors.rovio.com/en/news-and-events/stock-exchange-releases/rovio-entertainment-corp-inside-information-sega-announces">Sega is buying Rovio</a>, the Finnish video-game company best known for creating <em>Angry Birds, </em>in a €706 million (~$776 million) deal. Though a slew of existing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-21-sega-forever-free-mobile-retro-games.html">Sega games are available on iOS and Android</a>, like <em>Sonic the Hedgehog,</em> the company is looking to &quot;accelerate its expansion&quot; into mobile gaming.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Buying Rovio will give Sega access to <a href="https://www.rovio.com/articles/beacon-by-rovio-the-games-platform/">Beacon</a>, its &quot;high-level experience&quot; platform designed to improve and simplify game design, monetization and maintenance. Basically, its the accelerator Sega is looking for to bring it's current and future titles into the big leagues of mobile gaming. &quot;I feel blessed to be able to announce such a transaction with Rovio, a company that owns <em>Angry Birds</em>, which is loved across the world, and home to many skilled employees that support the company’s industry leading mobile game development and operating capabilities,&quot; Haruki Satomi, President and CEO of Sega Sammy, said in a statement.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Angry Birds</em> truly was the definition of a &quot;phenomenon.&quot; There was a time in the early 2010s when if you asked someone if they were playing <em>Angry Birds</em>, almost everyone said yes. In early 2014, Rovio said the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-01-22-angry-birds-series-pecks-up-2-billion-downloads.html"><em>Angry Birds series had surpassed two billion downloads</em></a><em>, </em>with 200 million playing the games each month.</p><p>Its popularity has certainly dipped in the years since, but that's not to say <em>Angry Birds</em> disappeared from the world's consciousness (<a href="https://www.rovio.com/articles/rovio-games-have-surpassed-5-billion-total-downloads/">Rovio has over five billion downloads</a>). A <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-08-25-angry-birds-movie-sequel.html">2015 movie</a> inspired by the game grossed just under $347 million worldwide, though 2019's '<em>The Angry Birds Movie 2</em>' dipped to $147.8 million, according to <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt6095472/"><em>Box Office Mojo</em></a>. Just last year, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/original-angry-birds-game-returns-122034240.html"><em>Angry Birds</em> returned to the App Store</a> for 99 cents as <em>Rovio Classics: Angry Birds. </em></p><p>Rovio has yet to produce anything close to the success of <em>Angry Birds</em> but, with the deal expected to close &quot;during the third quarter of 2023,&quot; it'll be interesting to see what comes next.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/sega-is-buying-angry-birds-maker-rovio-for-776-million-095400749.html?src=rss

<p>There's some controversy in the photography world as an AI-generated image won a major prize at a prestigious competition, <a href="https://petapixel.com/2023/04/14/artist-refuses-prize-after-his-ai-image-wins-at-top-photo-contest/"><em>PetaPixel</em></a> has reported. An piece called <a href="https://www.eldagsen.com/pseudomnesia/"><em>The Electrician</em></a> by Boris Eldagsen took first prize in the Creative category at the World Photography Organization’s Sony World Photography Awards — despite not being taken by a camera. Eldagsen subsequently refused the award, saying "AI is not photography. I applied... to find out if the competitions are prepared for AI images to enter. They are not."</p><p>Eldagsen's image is part of a series called <em>PSEUDOMNESIA: Fake Memories</em>, designed to evoke a photographic style of the 1940s. However, they are in reality "fake memories of a past, that never existed, that no one photographed. These images were imagined by language and re-edited more between 20 to 40 times through AI image generators, combining ‘inpainting’, ‘outpainting’, and ‘prompt whispering’ techniques."</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In a blog, Eldagsen explained that he used his experience as a photographer to create the prize-winning image, acting as a director of the process with the AI generators as "co-creators." Although the work is inspired by photography, he said that the point of the submission is that it is <em>not</em> photography. "Participating in open calls, I want to speed up the process of the Award organizers to become aware of this difference and create separate competitions for AI-generated images," he said.</p><p>Eldagsen subsequently declined the prize. “Thank you for selecting my image and making this a historic moment, as it is the first AI-generated image to win in a prestigious international photography competition,” he <a href="https://www.eldagsen.com/sony-world-photography-awards-2023/">wrote</a>. “How many of you knew or suspected that it was AI generated? Something about this doesn’t feel right, does it? AI images and photography should not compete with each other in an award like this. They are different entities. AI is not photography. Therefore I will not accept the award.”</p><p>Shortly thereafter, the photo was stripped from the show and <a href="https://www.worldphoto.org/sony-world-photography-awards/winners-galleries/2023/open/winners/creative-2023-open-competition">competition website</a> and organizers have yet to comment on the matter. Edalgsen actually traveled to London to attend the ceremony and even got up on stage (uninvited) to read a statement in person.&nbsp;</p><p>It's not clear if the organizers knew the work was AI-generated or not (Eldagsen said he told them it was). In any case, rather than shrinking from the situation, they should be embracing it. AI-generated art has entered the culture in a huge way over the past year, with AI winning both <a href="https://www.techradar.com/opinion/an-ai-generated-image-has-won-a-photo-contest-and-its-just-the-beginning">photo</a> and <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJjODEzYWUzOS03ZDU4LTQxY2ItYWM2Ni1hZDgzMDYwNmNlZWYiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8wMi90ZWNobm9sb2d5L2FpLWFydGlmaWNpYWwtaW50ZWxsaWdlbmNlLWFydGlzdHMuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMDlkOTUyMzAtMjdmZS00MDFhLWFmYjktYjgzOGFjZDgxMGNiIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAYyHSQfBVxYex7T0HHQoZsPEPUWoN6HtvRbFRJWMAuZG&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2022%2F09%2F02%2Ftechnology%2Fai-artificial-intelligence-artists.html">art competitions</a> over the past few months. Eldagsen's piece is bound to create conversations about how to handle it, particularly when it encroaches into traditional mediums.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/german-artist-refuses-award-after-his-ai-image-wins-prestigious-photography-prize-071322551.html?src=rss
