## The Guardian view on the PM’s family finances: out of touch with reality | Editorial

<p>Rishi Sunak doesn’t merely look aloof – he appears to think the rules don’t apply to him</p><p>Polling companies often ask voters to pick a description from a list of phrases that they most associate with political leaders. When YouGov did this for Rishi Sunak in late March, the words people thought best <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/can-rishi-sunak-s-stock-market-like-government-fix-the-tory-divide-b6lw5h60z" title="">characterised</a> the prime minister was “out of touch”. This is hardly surprising. The family fortune is so big that he and his wife, Akshata Murty, appear on the Sunday Times rich list. He can not only afford a private swimming pool but also to pay to upgrade the local electricity grid to heat it. But the news that the prime minister is being <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/apr/17/parliament-watchdog-opens-investigation-into-rishi-sunak" title="">investigated</a> by the Commons standards watchdog over a failure to declare his wife’s interest in a childcare business that may benefit from his government’s budget is about more than mere wealth. It suggests that Mr Sunak is not just aloof but he thinks that the rules don’t apply to him.</p><p>Mr Sunak knows how toxic that charge can be – as it helped end Boris Johnson’s stint in Downing Street. The prime minister might dismiss the comparison. He says he did register his wife’s shares in Koru Kids, a private childminding agency that is taking part in a government pilot, with the Cabinet Office. The trouble is a statement of ministers’ interests has yet to be published. There are thus no public records available that Mr Sunak has registered his wife’s commercial interests.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/17/the-guardian-view-of-the-pms-family-finances-out-of-touch-with-reality">Continue reading...</a>

## The Guardian view on management consultants: overused, underperforming | Editorial

<p>The omnipresence of consultancies is harming public services, while creating lucrative opportunities for private profit</p><p>Shortly after Margaret Thatcher took power, her environment secretary, Michael Heseltine, wrote: “The management ethos must run right through our national life – private and public companies, civil service, nationalised industries, local government, the National Health Service.” Since 1980, ministers have stayed true to his word. Britain is the <a href="https://www.consultancy.uk/news/24145/uk-remains-the-globes-second-largest-consulting-market" title="">outsourcing capital</a> of Europe. No other country on the continent relies so heavily on the consulting industry to do the work of the state. Earlier this year, ministers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/feb/06/ministers-quietly-scrap-limits-on-whitehall-spending-on-consultants" title="">quietly dropped</a> restrictions on spending controls, allowing Whitehall departments to potentially spend even more on external consultants.</p><p>Those controls were the product of David Cameron’s 2008 pledge to end what he called the reign of “<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/1950578/Labour-Tory-leader-David-Cameron-attacks-Labours-policy-by-PowerPoint.html" title="">policy by PowerPoint</a>”. Mr Cameron correctly argued that the use of consultancies had exploded under New Labour, whose faith in the credo of New Public Management, an agenda that sought to make the public sector function more like a business, produced lucrative opportunities for consultancies. Yet the story was hardly different under the Conservatives. While spending on consultants initially decreased under Mr Cameron’s government, economists Mariana Mazzucato and Rosie Collington note that consultancy firms bid for contracts at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/28/uk-ministers-consultants-whitehall" title="">cut-price rates</a> in an attempt to gain a foothold in government. When the time came for the state to spend big, the consultants would be ready.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/17/the-guardian-view-on-management-consultants-overused-underperforming">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Former player Bryan Gil helped to secure a 2-0 win for Sevilla that kept Valencia in the bottom three and in desperate trouble</p><p>At the end of the tunnel, Bryan Gil found a quiet corner to talk to old friends, lingering by the dressing room door, but there wasn’t much he could say that would help now. The last time he had been here, a year ago, he and his Valencia teammates had gathered on the stadium balcony overlooking Avenida Suecia, leaping about and spraying champagne everywhere. That night, thousands gathered below, celebrating reaching the Cup final and singing for him to stay. This time, late on Sunday night, they were out there again; though he had changed team and they had changed tune.</p><p>Gil had thought he would be back, just not like this. In the summer, a deal had been done to return to Valencia on loan again, only for Antonio Conte, then Tottenham manager, to block it; in the winter, it had happened again, Valencia signing no one. Gil had joined Sevilla instead, returning to Mestalla only to slip in the knife. About the only man applauded off, he departed wearing an apologetic look, aware of the damage done, how they hurt: the winger who had helped take Valencia to a final back then helped send them towards <em>segunda</em> now, with a 2-0 victory that pulled Sevilla safe. “Air to breathe,” Suso called it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/apr/17/la-liga-valencia-sevilla-bryan-gil-ruben-baraja-relegation-threat">Continue reading...</a>

Junior doctors are instrumental to fixing the crisis. They progress to being the leaders of services and systems in the future, and at present recognise the disparity between themselves and other equivalent professional salaries and work-life experiences. They carry much debt (funding five or six university years), and there is no doubt that pay has been eroded. The job is also harder, carries more risk and is often less professionally satisfying than 10 years ago.

<p><strong>Dr David Griffith </strong>points out that the lack of symptoms for type 2  diabetes makes it a particularly pernicious condition</p><p>Your article on diabetes provided much useful information (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/apr/13/inaction-on-diabetes-has-plunged-the-the-uk-into-a-wholly-avoidable-crisis" title="">Inaction on diabetes has plunged the UK into a wholly avoidable crisis, 13 April</a>), but it is important to clarify one point. The symptoms mentioned (thirst, passing a lot of urine, unintentional weight loss) are particularly features of type 1 diabetes, which, as the article states, only accounts for about 8% of cases. The far commoner type 2 diabetes, linked to obesity, is frequently symptomless and may only be detected by chance during screening or on testing before operations, for example.</p><p>This lack of symptoms makes it a particularly pernicious condition as the body may be undergoing insidious damage over years without the person realising they have diabetes. This leads to the other major way in which the condition is detected, namely with problems with already damaged tissues such as eyes, nerves, kidneys or vascular systems. These changes may by then be irreversible. Absence of symptoms unfortunately does not rule out the possibility of diabetes.<br /><strong>Dr David Griffith</strong><br /><em>Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/apr/17/how-type-2-diabetes-can-remain-hidden">Continue reading...</a>

<p>She was a Swedish mystic who believed angels guided her work. Why has this overlooked pioneer now been paired with Piet Mondrian, a jazz-mad Dutchman rebelling against his dad’s religion? The answer lies in the spirit world</p><p>Angels from the spirit realm told Hilma af Klint that becoming a vegetarian would fuel her creativity. This great Swedish artist, whose pioneering works predate the first purely abstract compositions by the likes of Kandinsky and Mondrian, was used to taking advice from higher forces. She was a member of the marvellously named De Fem (the Five), a group of female artists who organised seances and made art under the guidance of spirits called Ananada, Amaliel, Clemens, Esther, Georg and Gregor. “There are foods that cause lethargy in the body,” Af Klint once wrote. “There are foods that sustain the body, and finally there are foods that come from the opposite direction, that sustain the body in a non-material way.”</p><p>I think about those words as I stroll with Briony Fer through one of the most beautiful rooms in Europe, a gallery at Stockholm’s Moderna Museet containing a series of paintings called The Ten Largest. Perhaps without a vegetarian diet, these grand grids and intersecting circles – suggesting shells, wings, swans, flowers and sunbursts – might never have existed. Nor, perhaps, would her proto-pop art palette of sunny oranges, feminine blues and masculine yellows (expressing physical and spiritual love) have been so thrilling.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/17/ouija-board-hilma-af-klint-occult-outcast-tate-modern-mondrian">Continue reading...</a>

<p>To get earthworms for fishing, people do a thing called ‘worm grunting’</p><p></p><p>An article on earthworms published in the New York Times <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1881/12/18/103401662.pdf?pdf_redirect=true&amp;ip=0">in 1881</a> – “Habits of earth-worms: The curious work which they accomplish” – describes a helminth British empire. “In England they abound in the fields, in the paved courts of houses, though they are rarer in bog fields,” the author writes. “Worm castings have been found as high as 1,500 feet in the Scotch hills and at great altitudes in south India, and on the Himalaya mountains. Both in the extremes of a climate like England and in very hot weather, worms cease their work.”</p><p>Earthworms are hermaphrodites, which the journalist, all the way back in 1881, expresses in a glittering sentence: “Two sexes unite in one individual but two individuals pair”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/commentisfree/2023/apr/18/an-earthworm-when-you-are-a-child-these-are-an-enormous-part-of-your-world">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Premier League leaders have used up most of their lives but it is too early to write off their quest to outlast Manchester City</p><p>Amid the sense of disbelief and frustration that Arsenal had snatched a second straight draw from the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/16/west-ham-arsenal-premier-league-match-report">jaws of victory at West Ham</a>, Granit Xhaka was on hand to add a dose of pragmatism. “If something is not going well, it is easy to show the finger to someone else,” he said of their faltering title push. “We took this challenge up until now and nobody was thinking about this before the season. Let’s refresh everything now.”</p><p>The path towards an extraordinary achievement has narrowed considerably and the annoyance for Mikel Arteta will be that it did not have to be this way. There was a moment not long before they let West Ham back into proceedings when the silence around London Stadium verged on eerie: Arsenal were passing their way towards a victory of consummate ease and, in hindsight, perhaps they were lulled by the occasion’s near-total lack of edge. Neither their hosts nor those in the stands were evincing genuine belief that the afternoon might turn on its head.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/17/granit-xhaka-arsenal-manchester-city-premier-league-football">Continue reading...</a>

Innovative pianist who preferred the term American classical music to jazz, and became a favourite of hip-hop artists<p>The dapper and sagacious Ahmad Jamal may have looked more like a UN delegate than a jazz musician, but he was recognised as a truly great jazz artist by some of the music’s most notable pioneers. Jamal, who has died aged 92, was hailed in the 1940s and 50s by Art Tatum and Miles Davis, and more recently by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/09/mccoy-tyner-obituary" title="">McCoy Tyner</a> and Keith Jarrett. In the 90s, when a jazz piano-trio renaissance was being led by gifted newcomers such as Brad Mehldau, Jason Moran, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jul/03/geri-allen-obituary" title="">Geri Allen</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jun/17/jazz.obituaries" title="">Esbjörn Svensson</a>, Jamal did not retire to the sidelines but played better than ever. The former <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/02/ellis-marsalis-jazz-wynton-branford" title="">Wynton Marsalis</a> pianist and composer Eric Reed has said that Jamal is to the piano trio “what Thomas Edison was to electricity”.</p><p>He was a fascinating philosopher of contemporary music and a lifelong critic of the entertainment business, which he accused of fleecing African-American artists. Although he recognised the structural and technical distinctions of jazz and European classical music, he was adamant that there was no superiority of one over the other in what he called “the emotional dimensions”. “You have to know what the hell you’re doing,” he told me in 1996, “whether you’re playing the body of work from Europe or the body of work from Louis Armstrong.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/17/ahmad-jamal-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The obsession with a subject most people don’t need to study until they are 18 is typical of a system that fails to equip pupils for modern life</p><p>Rishi Sunak is clearly gripped by maths. Today’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/apr/17/anti-maths-mindset-costs-uk-a-huge-sum-rishi-sunak-claims">attack</a> on what he sees as Britain’s “anti-maths mindset” is his second this year. The prime minister wants to embarrass all innumerates and make not being good at maths socially unacceptable. Lack of maths, he says, is costing the country “tens of billions a year”. So he wants students in England to study maths in some form until they are 18, with a review forthcoming.</p><p>Ever since Margaret Thatcher, certain politicians have been obsessed by maths – and for one reason. Its results are quantifiable, measurable and susceptible to central control. Yet two of the most successful countries in the supposed endgame of maths – the science industries – are the US and Britain, and they rank 17th and 38th in the Pisa international rankings for maths. In other words, for the minority of pupils whose careers require maths – and who keep Britain in the top leagues for Nobel prizes – the nation’s maths seems good enough. It is fine too for those for whom the subject is both fascinating and even beautiful, which includes me.</p><p>Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist <br /></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/17/rishi-sunak-maths-schools-subject-study">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Empire Polo Club, Indio, California</strong></p><p>The elusive singer made his headliner debut at the desert festival but delivered an awkward set of some high highs but very low lows</p><p>There was perhaps no one more highly and anxiously anticipated at Coachella this year than Frank Ocean. The 35-year-old has not released an album since Blonde, in 2016, and has not performed live in over six years. His headliner set at Coachella, originally slated for 2020, was delayed by Covid and then pushed back again. A refusenik and a renegade whose enigmatic public presence toggles between achingly tender and, more often, highly elusive, Ocean is beloved for two albums’ worth of nostalgia-tinged, genre-defying music. I encountered several people over the weekend for whom he was more or less the reason they bought tickets to the festival.</p><p>Those fans, as well as a good fraction of the festival who stayed for Ocean’s weekend-capping set on Sunday night, had their patience tested. There were warning signs of something amiss, namely the last-minute cancellation of a planned YouTube live stream for his show. The main stage screens still showed test visuals at his 10pm start time, for which people began staking out good spots an hour beforehand. By the time the show started an hour later, “come on, Frank!” was a common refrain.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/17/frank-ocean-coachella-review-stream">Continue reading...</a>

That means a gig punctuated by long, pregnant silences – “the no charisma between songs thing”, as she puts it – during which Harding adjusts her microphone stand, moves a chair across the stage and switches instruments, which she has a habit of looking at as if she’s never seen them before. When she does say something, it’s often a non sequitur: “I found this guitar in a river”; “I need a reset because this” – the venue – “is … a dome”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/17/aldous-harding-review-performative-strangeness-cant-hide-great-melodies">Continue reading...</a>

Slightly bashfully, she says yes, she does have a regular order: chicken, chips and slaw. “I was tempted to go for the lemon and herb, just so everyone would know I was a massive wimp,” she admits. “I’ll have medium. It <em>is</em> lunchtime.”</p><p>Fry, 39, was born in Essex, and grew up just over the Hertfordshire border, in Hoddesdon, near Harlow, the middle child of three sisters. Her mother is Irish. “I don’t know whether this is uniform across all of Ireland, but certainly, my family are not culinary experts.” Take Christmas, for example. “In the Irish family, there will be roast potato, mashed potato, boiled potatoes. Maybe hash browns and croquettes. That’s what I like to call the Irish mixed grill,” she jokes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/apr/17/hannah-fry-interview-mum-wasnt-focused-on-cooking-boiled-sardines">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The policy that has topped up pensions should be applied to working-age benefits</p><p>Even before the energy crunch, statistical warning lights were signalling a return to levels of penury we once thought had been consigned to history: in the 2010s, <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/supplementary-information/2021/admissions-for-scurvy-rickets-and-malnutrition-2007-08-to-2020-21" title="">diagnoses</a> of malnutrition in hospital and the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/housing/articles/roughsleepingintheuk/2002to2021" title="">official count of rough sleepers</a> both doubled, while the number of food banks skyrocketed.</p><p>According to Matthew Desmond – the American sociologist who moved to a Milwaukee trailer park to witness privation close up – “poverty isn’t a line” but “a tight knot of social maladies”, “a relentless piling on” of difficulties. This comes through vividly in the stories uncovered across the UK by reporters I have been working with to illuminate the causes of the poverty crisis and possible remedies. Stories like that of Sandra, a disabled Buckinghamshire woman whose lack of a decent bed aggravated her asthma to the point where her heart briefly stopped; or of Lindsay – 600 miles north in the Orkneys – who lies under sheets damp with condensation feeling not only cold, but also “mad”; or of Sophie in Manchester, Lowri in Blackpool and Yvonne in Tottenham, north London, whose reluctance to tell family and friends about the hunger they face distances them from the very people who could offer support through hard times. Or indeed, tales of the empty days of Francis in Glasgow, which led him to seek comfort in drink, which in turn left him with too little money for the right food, too little iron in his body, and therefore too few healthy red blood cells.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/17/the-big-idea-why-we-need-a-triple-lock-against-poverty">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Utterly singular, consistently excellent, capable of anything it puts its mind to, this comedy-drama is one of the best things ever televised. Don’t let it end without giving it a try</p><p>For five years now, Barry has not only been one of the very best things on television, but one of the most criminally overlooked. To some extent, this makes perfect sense. It has a bland, terrible, functionally useless title that gives nothing of itself to prospective viewers. What’s more, it has a premise – a comedy about a hitman who decides to become an actor – that sounds like the stuff of the hackiest sitcom imaginable. If these two things were all you knew of Barry, you’d probably give it a swerve as well.</p><p>But please don’t. The fourth and final season of Barry is about to start, and it is worth every second of your time. There might be bigger shows than Barry on television. There might be better publicised shows. I’m already glumly resigned to the fact that the climax of (the brilliant) Succession will knock all the wind out of Barry’s sails and reduce its finale to an afterthought. But we can’t let this happen. Barry is so singular, so restless, so terrified of complacency, that it deserves to go down as one of the very best.</p><p>Barry season four is on HBO Max in the US and starts tonight on Sky Atlantic and Sky Now in the UK.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/17/barry-this-hitman-comedy-is-one-of-the-most-overlooked-and-brilliant-shows-on-tv">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Brazen judicial overreach to curb abortion access proves the right wing will abandon their principles to get their way</p><p>Before the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade last June, the conservative line on the American judiciary was fairly consistent: judges should be careful interpreters of the rules, not activists; legislatures should decide policy, while courts should simply enforce the law.</p><p>That was, of course, never true – conservatives have always been thrilled with judicial activists, as long as those activists moved the law to the right.

<p>Laurens, 45, met Alona, 33, on a flight and offered her ‘the cheesiest opening line’. Soon afterwards, she agreed to accompany him to his cousin’s wedding. They now live together in Tanzania<strong><br /></strong></p><p>When Laurens boarded a flight from Phuket to Bali in April 2011, the only thing on his mind was sleeping. “I’d gone straight from the bar to the airport and I was so hungover,” he says. “It was not my most glorious moment.” He had recently completed his medical training in anaesthesiology in Brussels and was taking a well-deserved break. “I’d been travelling in Fiji and Asia and was making my way to Bali for my cousin’s wedding.” Due to exhaustion, he barely noticed Alona sitting next to him until they were about to land. “I was on a gap year working in Thailand and was taking a trip to Bali,” she says. “We both went to sleep but when we woke up we started talking.” Laurens asked her if she was travelling for business or pleasure, admitting “it was the cheesiest opening line”. They clicked straight away and continued chatting until they had picked up their luggage.</p><p>“My uncle came to get me from the airport and suggested we offer Alona a lift,” says Laurens. During the journey, the pair exchanged contact details and he asked her to join him the next day for a party with his cousins. They got on so well that, afterwards, he invited her to the wedding, too. “I ended up ditching my friends,” says Alona. “It was a Muslim wedding and I only had beach clothes, so I made myself an appropriate outfit from a scarf that I turned into a dress,” she says. “My family were definitely gossiping about me because I brought a girl I met on the plane,” laughs Laurens. They spent the next few days in Bali, driving around on scooters and talking about their lives. “He told me his dream was to move to Africa, where he was born,” says Alona. “At the time, it seemed like a holiday romance, so I didn’t take it seriously.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/17/how-we-met-i-had-gone-straight-from-the-bar-to-the-airport-then-i-sat-next-to-her-on-the-plane">Continue reading...</a>

## Much Ado review – Shakespeare adaptation offers modern British take

<p>Some sparky performances are not enough to stop this low-budget version of Shakespeare’s romcom falling flat</p><p>This well-intentioned adaptation of the Shakespeare romcom relocates the tale from Messina to modern day, faintly drizzly Britain. Beatrice (Emma Beth Jones) and her cousin Hero (Jody Larcombe) are imagined as university students enjoying a languid afternoon together, until their idyll is shattered by a busload of high-spirited rugby players. Among them is Benedick (Johnny Lucas) – a commitment-phobic hunk who is horrified by the idea of marriage, but has been locked for some time in a “merry war” of words with Beatrice – and Claudio, his wetter, kinder friend, who has a crush on Hero that is fated only to grow, bland though she may be. The four characters’ inevitable flightpath to bliss is imperilled, however, by the machinations of Don John (nicely played by Jack Boal), a classic Shakespearean chaos agent who can’t bear to see others happy.</p><p>Directed and produced by the promisingly named sisters Hillary and Anna-Elizabeth Shakespeare, this palpably low-budget effort brings many of the problems you might expect: dodgy lighting, dispiriting costumes and a washed-out palette. But there are other issues that can’t quite be attributed to money: for all the repartee between Beatrice and Benedick, the two actors have little chemistry, dampening the squib when they get together. Worse, some lines are rushed or mumbled, making the (already challenging) language hard to understand, while plangent indie music shoulders in at moments of high drama to do the emotional heavy-lifting. And the smooth progress of the story is marred by a few cringe-inducing moments, including a student party where the actors feign drunken flirting.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/17/much-ado-review-shakespeare-adaptation-offers-modern-british-take">Continue reading...</a>

## I’ve been in the grip of astrology all my life, so why am I turning my back on the stars? | Daisy Jones

<p>Smug detractors may roll their eyes, but this ancient art gave me a deep understanding of who I am – until it began to feel restrictive</p><p>In early 2017, I became completely <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/mar/11/star-gazing-why-millennials-are-turning-to-astrology">fixated on the movements of Jupiter</a>. The planet was hurtling towards my sign, Libra, which, in astrology terms, meant that I would feel the influence of the “luckiest” planet in the sky for as long as it remained in that position (a year). And I really did feel lucky that year. I made friends and lovers easily. I met the person I am now engaged to. Every day I woke up curious and excited, the bright, expansive presence of Jupiter floating right above me like a 61.42bn km² talisman. Thank you Jupiter, I remember thinking to myself. You are my favourite planet in space.</p><p>My astrology obsession may have reached new levels that year, but it’s always been there. The instant I was born, at 6.36am, my mum wrote down the time so that I’d have an accurate birth chart (an insight into my character based on the alignment of the planets at my time of birth). Growing up, my grandma often read our tarot, the cards spread out on her soft, flowery bed, a vehicle for an unspoken closeness. And I had my own private relationship with astrology, too. Potential relationships would be vetted via star signs<strong> </strong>(I date Sagittariuses, not Capricorns). <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/may/30/i-dont-even-believe-in-astrology-so-why-am-i-addicted-to-this-horoscope-app">Life choices would be explained by the planets</a> (no one goes out during Cancer season). And my conception of myself became hugely shaped by my own astrological makeup (a double Libra: charming when necessary, persuasive, more than a little flaky). In later years, I’d find myself scanning horoscope websites and checking astrology apps such as Co-Star and The Pattern daily.</p><p>Daisy Jones is a writer and author of All the Things She Said</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/17/astrology-stars-art-understanding-restrictive">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With films such as O Lucky Man! and Britannia Hospital, the British auteur portrayed his country as a bleak dystopia in decline – what would he make of today’s Britain?</p><p>‘No film can be too personal,” declared Lindsay Anderson in the Free Cinema manifesto of 1956. A decade later he lived up to this slogan when he shot his elegy to youth rebellion If…. at his old school, Cheltenham College. Winning the Palme d’Or at the 1969 Cannes film festival, it was the first in a loose trilogy of films that held up a mirror to a contemporary Britain that Anderson considered to be in a state of moral decline.</p><p>O Lucky Man! followed in 1973. Malcolm McDowell, who had played the chief rebel in If…., returned as a modern-day Candide who discovers that 1970s society offers very little grounds for his natural optimism. A brilliant score from Alan Price underpins the film’s bleak viewpoint. In the words of the title song: “If you have a friend on whom you think you can rely, you are a lucky man!” Perhaps paradoxically, Anderson had many friends on whom he could rely even if he didn’t think so and I was lucky that some of those friends became my friends, too.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/17/the-director-who-dared-to-tell-uncomfortable-truths-lindsay-anderson-at-100">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sandro Schwarz departed on Sunday after Friday’s grim 5-2 defeat leaves Hertha rock-bottom of the Bundesliga</p><p>“That,” said Benjamin Weber, “was a real slap in the face.” Hertha’s sporting director has been in situ for less than three months, but he is already acclimatised to the chaos of the capital club. Not surprisingly, perhaps. Before <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jan/30/union-boss-the-berlin-derby-again-and-herthas-bobic-pays-the-price">returning to the club in late January</a> he had served the club for almost two decades in a variety of roles. “I’m a Berliner. I’m a Herthaner,” he told his introductory press conference.</p><p>This, then, will hurt. Hertha have been circling the drain for a while now, retaining their top-flight place via the relegation playoff last season having finished two points clear of the playoff spot the campaign before. This season has been more of the same struggle and instability. However this, as Weber’s assessment suggested, was something so much worse than the troubles to which they have become accustomed in recent times.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/apr/17/hertha-berlin-schalke-bottom-bundesliga">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Indians warned to stay vigilant during spell of very hot weather. Elsewhere, sandstorms plague China</p><p>The heatwave that has been plaguing the states of West Bengal, Bihar, and Andhra Pradesh in north-west India is forecast to continue through the coming week. Daytime temperatures of 40C have been recorded for several consecutive days in these regions, about 5C above the seasonal average.</p><p>This excessive heat is linked to a north-westerly flow of air, which is also bringing much drier than usual conditions. The authorities have advised people to be vigilant about their health by staying hydrated, wearing breathable clothing and avoiding street food, which could easily go off in these conditions.

## Was the Gen-Z Pentagon leaker motivated by social media clout? | Nancy Jo Sales

<p>Sources say he wanted to impress a bunch of teenage boys and young men who were his acolytes in a Discord chatroom</p><p>Massachusetts air national guardsman Jack Teixeira, 21, has been charged in a Boston court on two counts under the Espionage Act, and the question on everyone’s minds is why. Unlike with whistleblowers in the past such as Daniel Ellsberg (the Pentagon Papers) and Chelsea Manning (Wikileaks), neither ethics or politics seem to have been the motivation for Teixeira’s alleged leak of hundreds of pages of classified documents related to the war in Ukraine. He doesn’t appear to have been acting as an agent for a foreign government, according to his criminal complaint. So why is he allegedly behind one of the worst leaks of US intelligence in a decade, for which he now faces up to 15 years in prison?</p><p>Based on what we know so far, the answer may be that Teixeira did it, as they used to say, for the Vine – for social media clout. Sources say he wanted to impress a bunch of teenage boys and young men who were his acolytes in a Discord chat room of 20 to 30 gamers who referred to themselves as Thug Shaker Central – the most wannabe gangster name imaginable for a bunch of gamers whose leader (Teixeira) lived with his mother.</p><p>Nancy Jo Sales is the author, most recently, of Nothing Personal: My Secret Life in the Dating App Inferno</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/17/was-the-gen-z-pentagon-leaker-motivated-by-social-media-clout">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Goofy story about the residents of a ritzy apartment block racing to get rid of a murder victim just isn’t that funny</p><p>The madness of the Hong Kong property market takes centre stage in this goofy Cantonese-language comedy, set almost entirely over the course of one chaotic night in a luxury high-rise apartment block. Directed by Ho Cheuk-tin, it imagines how a bunch of ordinary Hongkongers would handle the unexplained appearance of a very naked and very dead man in their building.</p><p>Proceedings kick off when Ming (Wong You-nam) is having dinner with his wife (Jennifer Yu) in the apartment owned by his penny-pinching mother-in-law (Teresa Mo). When they hear a sinister thump outside the flat, they go to investigate – and find the corpse. Calling the police, they agree, would be risky, as their apartment could become a notorious “murder home” and lose value. So they try to make the corpse someone else’s problem, by dumping it outside another flat. Soon, other residents are drawn into the buck-passing, including two retired teachers and a failed footballer. As they all try to get rid of the body, they find a common enemy in Jiro Lee Sheung-ching’s believably priggish security guard.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/17/over-my-dead-body-review-corpse-comedy-riffs-on-hong-kong-property-prices">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Antony shows what he brings to Manchester United, Everton are in trouble and Arsenal hand City the edge in title race</p><p>The adage that 2-0 is football’s most dangerous scoreline has long since been dispensed with but Arsenal are making a good case for bringing it back. For the second week in a row Mikel Arteta’s side frittered away a hard-earned two-goal lead in a manner unbefitting of title hopefuls – the only time a team at the top of the Premier League has ever done so. There’s still time for them to put that right but after a seven-game winning streak, the sense of halted momentum will need to be recovered before the trip to Manchester City next Wednesday, from which Arsenal must get a result in order to avoid disappearing into City’s rearview. Should they fail to do so, it won’t be this season’s losses that cause them most regret. This was the fourth time Arsenal have turned a lead into a fairly desperate draw; all four have come against opponents that should have been swatted aside with ease.

The nation’s fields have always been prowled by genuine rotters, individuals who have thoroughly deserved such terrifying nicknames as “Chopper”, “Psycho”, “Bites yer Legs” and “Keano”, and the sport’s lengthy list of laws has only ever kind of governed them.

<p>Bath City footballer on his life-threatening brain injury after colliding with advertising hoardings and his inspiring recovery</p><p>It was, Alex Fletcher says, just an ordinary matchday but one that soon spiralled into the extraordinary and almost culminated in tragedy. There were the usual routines and rituals: the two-hour car journey from Exeter to Twerton Park with a few of his Bath City teammates, his double step and jump before the pre-match handshakes. He was on a high after scoring the winning goal at Tonbridge Angels in the National League South three days earlier, feeling on top of his game with the club pushing for the sixth‑tier playoffs. But five minutes into November’s match against Dulwich Hamlet, after haring on to a pass and attempting to cross the ball first time, Fletcher received a nudge and went thudding into advertising hoardings reinforced with concrete blocks.</p><p>His head pounded and there was a deafening ringing sound in his ears. Paramedics on the scene treated him for concussion, potential spine complications and kept him still. The concern on the face of his manager, Jerry Gill, the Bath chairman, Nick Blofeld, and the teammates drifting in and out of his eyeline told him everything. “Then I heard the stadium announcer say the game was abandoned,” Fletcher says. “At that point I knew it had to be serious. I actually remember feeling a bit of guilt, thinking: ‘Oh no, Dulwich have come all the way from London.’ I know what it is like, a massive pain to have to make that journey again, especially on a Tuesday night.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/17/alex-fletcher-bath-city-football">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I had my icons and I worshipped them. And one of them dumping on me from a great height was painful – though perhaps useful, too</p><p>When I was a teen, I Blu Tacked pictures of my icons to my bedroom wall, setting places for a dinner party I was 10 years too young to have and two decades late for. I thought carefully about where to place Mel Brooks and Carl Reiner, Billy Crystal, Peter Cook and the early 1960s comedy duo of Mike Nichols and Elaine May (photographed before they split and each became acclaimed directors). I loved Britpop, and placed Blur beside Steve Martin, so it looked as though he had gone prematurely grey from the stress of working as their security detail.</p><p>Sometimes my dad, grumbling about the stains revealed on my walls whenever the posters were rearranged, would walk in and bellow “Blu Tack must die”, then walk out again. I had started to watch Mike Nichols’ movies with my mum: the The Graduate, Working Girl and Postcards from the Edge were moments of true pleasure. I knew I wanted to be a writer, but I couldn’t yet put the words in the right order to get what was in myhead on to the page.

<p>It’s not easy to find Welsh speakers in Ohio, but Dafydd Jones was determined to learn the language of his parents and connect with his homeland 3,800 miles away</p><p>Dafydd Emrys Jones describes himself as a “passionate Welshman”, although he hasn’t lived in the country since childhood. For the past 32 years he has made his home in Cincinnati, Ohio, but the 74-year-old has had “a long journey” to get there. He was born in Wrexham, north Wales, “a city put on the map by the generosity of Ryan Reynolds,” he notes (Reynolds and co-owner Rob McElhenney <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/25/welcome-to-wrexham-review-ryan-reynolds-is-less-interesting-than-welsh-football-fans">bought the local football club</a> in 2021). He moved south to Cardiff, then passed through England, Germany, Belgium, France, Switzerland and the Netherlands during his career as an IT troubleshooter, but his Welsh identity has always remained precious. When people ask if he’s English, he tells them firmly that he’s Welsh: “They say ‘oh, it’s the same thing’; I say no!”</p><p>He did not, however, speak Welsh – a source of embarrassment. But when the Covid pandemic hit, Jones realised he had an opportunity to rectify that. As everything closed down, his usual hobbies – tango and ballroom dancing, or playing music with his Celtic band, <a href="http://ceolmhor.com/">Ceol Mhor</a> – were not available to him. “I’m not married, I have some friends, but I wasn’t going out. I was getting bored every night. So I sat at home thinking, bad as this Covid thing is, it also gives me an opportunity.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/may/04/tell-us-has-your-life-taken-a-new-direction-after-the-age-of-65">Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/17/a-new-start-after-60-i-dont-like-being-defeated-so-at-71-i-learned-welsh">Continue reading...</a>

## I turn 50 soon. Why would I want anyone to assume I am younger? | Viv Groskop

<p>The obsession with agelessness puts pressure on us to look and act forever young. But it’s far more liberating to be old and cheerfully weary</p><p>Who wants to be ageless? Not me. I am old. Hear me creak. To be old and to be able to participate, even if with increasing cynicism and decrepitude, in the unpredictable verb of “ageing” is surely a blessing. It is a gift famously more attractive than the perennially unpopular alternative. I will turn 50 this year and I have realised that I couldn’t care less if people think I am 70 or 80, let alone 50. I’m just happy to be around. I don’t need anyone to think I’m not 50, and I certainly don’t need them to believe I’m any younger. What would be the point? If people think you’re younger than you are (or, worse, that you “look good for your age”), there’s a pressure there. It might be manageable this month. But how are you going to maintain that over the next five years? Or 10 years? Let’s be optimistic. Better to act like you’re 90 now. I mean, you might never get there in reality. So channel that age. Get the practice in.</p><p>The thing is, we are monumentally spoilt, even with the latest alarming news of the UK’s stagnant life expectancy, which is <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3d25b1c9-33bf-448a-bb07-6a0fc3a8a603">slowly creeping downwards from the upper 80s</a>, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Because only 2,000 years ago, it was completely normal to expect to die a horrible death between the age of 20 and 35. Old people were outliers. It was only from around 1800 that average life expectancy in Europe pushed up to 40, and only in the past 200 years that it has moved beyond all previous imagining and we had to invent stupid sayings like “Age is just a number” and “60 is the new 50.” But if it really were just a number, then no one would need to say that it’s just a number. And if it’s all just numbers, then no number needs to be the new version of another number.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/17/i-turn-50-soon-why-would-i-want-anyone-to-assume-i-am-younger">Continue reading...</a>

<p>We cope with the micro slights and othering. But what are we to do when openly racist attitudes are exploited for political gain?</p><p>There is something particularly grotesque about a golliwog. It’s the smile, I think, its teeth frozen in a rictus grin behind the exaggerated redness of the lips. The golliwog seems to say that not only is it OK to “minstrelise” black people and display them as dolls, but that they should enjoy it.</p><p>That smile is the price of entry into white British society, of acceptance and integration into workplaces, social groups and our wider politics and culture. The golliwog, despite it being a relic of the past, is in fact a symbol of the present. You are only allowed visibility as a black figure if you’re grateful, permanently smiling in all circumstances. Your status, as someone who is part of Britain and therefore gets a say in how they experience it, is conditional on the fact that you must never suggest that the country is not quite so hospitable to you sometimes. Ideally, if you want social and professional mobility as a person of colour, if you want to be moved from the bottom shelf to a position of higher prominence, you must go further. You must grin harder and always maintain that Britain is, in fact, a race-relations utopia, even as things regularly happen that prove that we are far from that.</p><p>Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/17/british-pub-right-golliwogs-rightwing-politicians-press-racism-people-colour">Continue reading...</a>

She explains what it takes to be the world’s best javelin thrower, survive a breakdown and bounce back from financial ruin</p><p>In the latest of the many lives of Fatima Whitbread, the former champion javelin thrower has become a formidable reality TV star – and it suits her. She is surely one good show away from “beloved” status, which might prove to be the I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! spin-off in which she is soon to star, alongside a select group of other former participants in the ITV show.</p><p>She was on I’m a Celeb in 2011, when her nasal cavity became home to a cockroach during one of the challenges – “There’s definitely something wriggling about in there!” – and it took an hour for the camp doctor to flush it out. But I liked her best in last year’s Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins, the Channel 4 series in which celebs do Special Forces training; Whitbread cracked three ribs jumping out of a helicopter, but kept it a secret because she didn’t want to leave the show. She was charming, warm, capable and – having filmed it at 60 – ripped.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/17/your-childhood-can-haunt-you-fatima-whitbread-on-trauma-triggers-therapy-and-how-sport-saved-her">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There may not be many of them, but they can be very bright and fast, and viewing conditions look promising</p><p>The Lyrid meteor shower will reach its peak in the early hours of 23 April. Created by dust from the tail of comet C/1861 G1 (Thatcher), the Lyrids are not usually vast in number – only about 18 an hour are expected – but they are often very bright and fast moving. Some of the more spectacular ones are known to burn up so brightly that they cast shadows.</p><p>This year, viewing conditions are expected to be good because the moon has just 9% of its surface illuminated, so even faint meteors will be visible. Occasionally, brief outbursts of 100 meteors an hour have been recorded for the Lyrids. The last report of such an outburst came from the US in 1982 and before that Japan in 1945, and Greece in 1922.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/apr/17/starwatch-the-lyrid-meteor-shower-is-about-to-reach-its-peak">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Peaceful protest hasn’t stopped the climate crisis, so what should happen next? The makers of a new nerve-jangling film about eight young saboteurs talk about oil, extreme action and morality</p><p>In the baking heat of the west Texas desert, a young man is making a bomb. Hands trembling, sweat fogging his goggles, he slowly assembles the explosive. A knife-blade of powder is painstakingly poured into a tiny tube. Wires are shakily glued together. With infinite care, the delicate, deadly contraption takes shape. Outside the tin shack where this is all unfolding, another young man paces, remembering his friend’s instructions: “Don’t come in unless I tell you to. Unless you see fire.” He looks as if he’s about to be sick. The audience knows how he feels.</p><p>This is the tense setup at the heart of How to Blow Up a Pipeline, a propulsive, nerve-jangling thriller about eight young people who want to send a message about the urgency of the climate crisis by sabotaging an oil pipeline. The film takes its cues from its heroes: aiming to excite audiences into action instead of hectoring them into submission. It is one hell of a ride. After its premiere at Toronto last year, the New York Times pronounced How to Blow Up a Pipeline “a cultural landmark” for its sympathetic take on eco-terrorism, while the Washington City Paper described its youthful cast as “a much more intense, combustible version of The Breakfast Club”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/17/how-to-blow-up-a-pipeline-oil-extreme-action-eco-terrorism-self-defence">Continue reading...</a>
