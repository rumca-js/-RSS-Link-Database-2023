Interesting career choice from the man who helped write Halos 1-3, directed ODST, and recently held the title of Creative Director for Halo Infinite. We wish him well. In other Microsoft news, the dashboard for the Series X|S is likely to get a bit of a redesign in the near future. Beta testers submitted feedback recently, saying the dashboard had grown too cluttered. What do you think the new version will look like? Maybe something like...the Xbox 360 blades design? We can only hope. In the latest in the Dark and Darker legal drama, developer IRONMACE wants players to torrent their game. Because of a court order stemming from their lawsuit with Nexon, the game Dark and Darker can't be sold or made available through usual channels, so the devs are kinda sorta maybe encouraging pirating? And finally, Call of Duty: Warzone's new DLC offerings include a bundle that gives a distinct advantage to players who buy it\u2014basically it's pay-to-win.
