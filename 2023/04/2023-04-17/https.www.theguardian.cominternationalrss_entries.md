<ul><li>Barcelona president denies any legal wrongdoing by club</li><li>Laporta says he will defend club ‘until my last drop of blood’</li></ul><p>Joan Laporta came armed with four boxes, 633 referee reports and 43 CDs as he finally broke FC Barcelona’s silence over allegations that they <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/10/prosecutors-pursue-case-against-barcelona-over-alleged-refereeing-deal">tried to buy favourable decisions</a> from officials, declaring the club victims of a “gigantic” smear campaign and accusing rivals Real Madrid of “unprecedented cynicism”. In a two-hour press conference, finally called eight weeks after the first reports appeared that payments of more than €7m were allegedly made to the former vice-president of the referee’s committee, José María Enríquez Negreira, over an 18-year period, he went on the attack, declaring he would “defend the institution until my last drop of blood”.</p><p>The Barça president denied that the club had committed any legal wrongdoing, although he did say that these days the club’s compliance department would have flagged up a potential conflict of interests. There was no explanation as to why it had taken him so long to offer an explanation and he did nothing to defend the other three men who presided over the club during the period under investigation: Joan Gaspart, Sandro Rosell and Josep Maria Bartomeu.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/17/joan-laporta-barcelona-negreira-real-madrid">Continue reading...</a>

Indeed, until I saw a tweet from fellow food writer Sejal Sukhadwala expressing surprise that the “‘official’ coronation recipes” were so “random”, I’d assumed the palace wouldn’t even bother trying to compete with Constance Spry’s 1953 triumph. And then, just before noon, the royal family’s Twitter account casually dropped the coronation quiche into the mix.</p><p>Described as having been “chosen personally by their majesties the king and the queen consort”, on first glance it ticks more boxes than Gregg Wallace’s (official) prawn and pineapple tacos, not least because during the pandemic, Clarence House sought to comfort the nation with a recipe for cheesy baked eggs described as one of the then prince’s favourites.</p><p>Read Felicity’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/20/felicity-cloake-masterclass-quiche-lorraine-recipe">quiche lorraine </a>masterclass and more of her <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/series/how-to-cook-the-perfect----">How to cook the perfect …</a> recipes.</p><p>Buy her Completely Perfect recipe collection at the <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/completely-perfect-9780241367872">Guardian bookshop</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/apr/17/more-like-spinach-pie-felicity-cloake-tests-king-charles-and-camillas-coronation-quiche">Continue reading...</a>

## Maria Mater Meretrix review – beautifully paced evening of drama and quiet darkness

<p><strong>Barbican, London<br /></strong>Devised by violinist Patricia Kopatchinskaja and soprano Anna Prohaska, this sequence of vocal and instrumental pieces explored depictions of the Virgin Mary and Mary Magdalene with stylish verve<br /></p><p>Mary the mother of Jesus has been celebrated across many art forms, especially in countless paintings from the middle ages onwards, and in Marian music written by composers of every epoch up to the present. But the other Mary conventionally regarded as having been present at Christ’s crucifixion is a much harder figure to pin down, for across the centuries Mary Magdalene has been seen as one of Christ’s closest friends and followers, as a saint, a muse, and even as a meretrix – the word used for a courtesan in Ancient Rome.</p><p>Maria Mater Meretrix, the evening-long sequence of vocal and instrumental pieces devised by <a href="https://en.patriciakopatchinskaja.com/">Patricia Kopatchinskaja</a> and <a href="http://www.annaprohaska.com/">Anna Prohaska</a>, brings the two Marys together, comparing and contrasting the ways in which they have been depicted across nine centuries of music; a performance with the violinist and soprano joined by Ensemble Resonanz was the last event in the Barbican’s Kopatchinskaja Artist Spotlight series. It’s a thoughtfully put together collection, beautifully paced and presented, and taking in 14 composers, from Hildegard of Bingen to George Crumb and György Kurtág, all performed with stylishness, verve and just a touch of theatricality by these superb artists.</p><p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4NqVrlViIaqKnRmXQbYcXc?si=CuO3k9F8RRuZJNOIWVjkfg">Patricia Kopatchinskaja and Anna Prohaska’s recording of Maria Mater Meretrix</a> is now available on Alpha.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/17/maria-mater-meretrix-review-patricia-kopatchinskaja-anna-prohaska-barbican-london">Continue reading...</a>
