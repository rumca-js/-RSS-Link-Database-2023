On today's Daily Fix:
Halo franchise veteran Joseph Staten is leaving the series—and Microsoft—to join Netflix Games. Interesting career choice from the man who helped write Halos 1-3, directed ODST, and recently held the title of Creative Director for Halo Infinite. We wish him well. In other Microsoft news, the dashboard for the Series X|S is likely to get a bit of a redesign in the near future. Beta testers submitted feedback recently, saying the dashboard had grown too cluttered. What do you think the new version will look like? Maybe something like...the Xbox 360 blades design? We can only hope. In the latest in the Dark and Darker legal drama, developer IRONMACE wants players to torrent their game. Because of a court order stemming from their lawsuit with Nexon, the game Dark and Darker can't be sold or made available through usual channels, so the devs are kinda sorta maybe encouraging pirating? And finally, Call of Duty: Warzone's new DLC offerings include a bundle that gives a distinct advantage to players who buy it—basically it's pay-to-win. Bummer.

## Dragon Ball Z: Unboxing a Huge $300 Action Figure of Porunga The Namek Dragon

Dragon Ball Z fans wishing for a massive action figure of Porunga, the Namek Dragon, your wish is granted! Thankfully, we didn't have to track down the Dragon Balls to summon him, since Bandai Namco sent over a sample of the brand new Tamashii Nations Bandai Spirits S.H.Figuarts Porunga and Dende box set to check out. The official product title is "Porunga & Dende Luminous Dragon Ball Set - Come Forth, Genuine Shenron!! - Dragon Ball Z - Bandai Spirits S.H.Figuarts" which is a little longwinded, not to mention a bit disrespectful to earth's dragon Shenron.

Porunga is well over a foot tall when mounted on his stand, and the included base also lights up and plays sound clips from the original anime when the Dragon Balls are placed properly thanks to NFC technology, similar to how Amiibo work. Porunga and Dende both include alternate sets of hands, and Dende has an alternate head too. Now let's see if he'll grant our wish for a Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 4 gameplay trailer or maybe a release date.

If you want to grab a Porunga for yourself, the figure is currently (as of posting this video) in stock on the IGN store.

As a deadly new wave of the Sick bears down, Gus (Christian Convery) and a band of fellow hybrids are held prisoner by General Abbot (Neil Sandilands) and the Last Men.

To protect his friends, Gus agrees to help Dr. Singh, beginning a dark journey into his origins and his mother Birdie’s (Amy Seimetz) role in the events leading up to The Great Crumble. 

Outside the Preserve, Tommy Jepperd (Nonso Anozie) and Aimee Eden (Dania Ramirez ) team up to break the hybrids free, a partnership that will be tested as Jepperd’s secrets come to light. As the revelations of the past threaten the possibility of redemption in the present, Gus and his found family find themselves on a collision course with Abbot and the evil forces that look to wipe them out once and for all. 

Based on the DC comic book series by Jeff Lemire, Sweet Tooth is executive produced by Jim Mickle, Susan Downey, Robert Downey, Jr., Amanda Burrell, and Linda Moran. The series is produced by Warner Bros. Television.

While it's true that video games have almost always used some form of AI in the game's engine, the meaning of AI within gaming is beginning to shift in a major way. With tools like Ubisoft Ghostwriter, artificial intelligence is about to change the way games are developed. In this video, we'll discuss the potential positive impacts that AI will have when developers can implement the tools readily available. We'll also be taking a look at the disruptive harm AI tools can be when they become dangerously close to taking away creative and top-level design decisions away from humans. 


Throughout the week of April 17th - 21st, IGN is having what we're dubbing "AI Week". All week long we'll be taking a look at the sudden burst of AI use in the games, tech, and entertainment industries while evaluating their impacts. Will AI change video games forever? Matt Kim delves into the trend that has taken over the games industry in 2023 as part of IGN AI Week.

Who should train under Rey in her New Jedi Order?

Star Wars Celebration brings us the news on Star Wars movies to come, with a New Jedi Order lead by Rey! On the heels of training with Luke Skywalker, she is forming the entire Order from scratch, and we’re wondering if her old friend Finn could be of help? We haven’t seen Finn Jedi edition yet, but some hints of The force could put him among the ranks of Grogu, Cal Kestis, Cere Junda, Ezra Bridger, Jacen Syndulla, and other potential Force wielders left in the galaxy. 

With these new Star Wars movies announced, we’ve got ideas for what might be going down in this new Star Wars movie alone, and how FN2187 might have a chance at plot redemption. But will Luke Skywalker be a literal presence in the New Jedi Order? He’d bring the Star Wars lore for sure, with the example of Darth Vader looming over Rey. New Jedi Order members may be hard to come by though. In the New Jedi Order, Rey has a clean slate basically. She most likely knows how Luke Skywalker’s Jedi Order was created and the pitfalls there. 

How can Rey avoid the mistakes of Luke Skywalker’s New Jedi Order though, if he was her one guide? The expanded universe may be of help! Even if the Jedi Temple has been empty for years, many Star Wars Legends can still come into play! Could this Jedi Order somehow even include Ben Solo? Kyle Katarn? Anyone else saved from Order 66? The lore is there from Return of the Jedi onward, and we’ve got Kathleen Kennedy as a direct source. Do you think Jedi Survivor is possible to come into play? Watch and leave your comments below!

We played a 20-minute demo of Daymare: 1994 Sandcastle, the next in the series of Resident Evil-inspired survival games. But this time, we weren't particularly impressed by the slice we experienced – particularly in a post-Resident Evil 4 Remake world –but remain hopeful that the rest of the game can get where it clearly wants to go. Previewed on PC by Jarrett Green.
