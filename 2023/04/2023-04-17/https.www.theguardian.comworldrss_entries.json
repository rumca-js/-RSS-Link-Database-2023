Enraged over Manhattan district attorney <strong>Alvin Bragg</strong>\u2019s indictment of <strong>Donald Trump </strong>and insistent that <strong>Joe Biden</strong> acquiesce to their demands in order to raise the debt ceiling, top House Republicans have relocated New York City today to press their cases in unique venues. Led by Trump ally <strong>Jim Jordan</strong>, the judiciary committee will hold a hearing on crime in New York, an issue they say Bragg is ignoring in favor of Trump\u2019s prosecution. Expect Democrats to respond forcefully to the allegation. Meanwhile, House speaker <strong>Kevin McCarthy </strong>will give an address at the New York Stock Exchange and warn of the consequences of not increasing America\u2019s borrowing limit, while arguing that the GOP\u2019s demands for spending cuts and other reforms aren\u2019t unreasonable.
