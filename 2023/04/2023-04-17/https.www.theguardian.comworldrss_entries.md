<p>Conspiracy theorist and election denier Marjorie Taylor Greene says national guardsman Jack Teixeira has been treated unfairly. Plus, New Jersey to celebrate Bruce Springsteen Day</p><p>Good morning.</p><p>Senator Lindsey Graham <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/16/pentagon-leaker-lindsey-graham-marjorie-taylor-greene">condemned his fellow Republican</a> Marjorie Taylor Greene as “terribly irresponsible” yesterday after the far-right congresswoman defended the air national guardsman charged with leaking Pentagon intelligence documents.</p><p><strong>What did Greene say?</strong> “Teixeira is white, male, Christian, and antiwar. That makes him an enemy to the Biden regime. And he told the truth about troops being on the ground in Ukraine and a lot more,” Greene, a congresswoman from Georgia, said on Twitter. “Ask yourself who is the real enemy? A young low-level national guardsman? Or the administration that is waging war in Ukraine, a non-Nato nation, against nuclear Russia without war powers?”</p><p><strong>Does anyone else agree with her?</strong> Yes. Other rightwing figures have also defended Teixeira, with Tucker Carlson, the influential Fox News host, praising him as someone who “told Americans what’s actually happening in Ukraine”.</p><p><strong>What is Dominion hoping to get from the case?</strong> Dominion is asking a Delaware jury to award $1.6bn in damages because it says Fox knowingly or recklessly disregarded the truth when it broadcast outlandish lies about its voting equipment. US law sets a very high bar to win a defamation lawsuit and cases rarely go to trial. Dominion’s case, experts say, is unusually strong.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/17/first-thing-lindsey-graham-calls-fellow-republican-irresponsible-for-defending-pentagon-leaker">Continue reading...</a>
