US Release Date: August 2023
Starring: Ariella Glaser, Bryce Gheisar, Dame Helen Mirren
Director: Marc Forster
Synopsis: From the best-selling author of Wonder, the book that sparked a movement to "choose kind," comes the inspirational next chapter. In White Bird: A Wonder Story, we follow Julian (Bryce Gheisar), who has struggled to belong ever since he was expelled from his former school for his treatment of Auggie Pullman. To transform his life, Julian's grandmother (Helen Mirren) finally reveals to Julian her own story of courage -- during her youth in Nazi-occupied France, a boy shelters her from mortal danger. They find first love in a stunning, magical world of their own creation, while the boy's mother (Gillian Anderson) risks everything to keep her safe. From director Marc Forster (Finding Neverland and Christopher Robin), screenwriter Mark Bomback, and based on R.J. Palacio's book, White Bird: A Wonder Story, like Wonder before it, is an uplifting movie about how one act of kindness can live on forever.
