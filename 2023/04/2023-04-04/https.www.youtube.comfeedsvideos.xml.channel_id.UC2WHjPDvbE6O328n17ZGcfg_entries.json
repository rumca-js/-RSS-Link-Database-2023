But is it? Because just after Microsoft\u2019s initial investment in 2019, OpenAI legally restructured from a non-profit company to a \u201ccapped\u201d for-profit company, with ongoing collaborations exclusively with Microsoft.\nSo, how did we get here? Why did OpenAI go from a non-profit for humanity to a for-profit that's heavily intertwined with Microsoft? And what has OpenAI accomplished?\nWell in this video, that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m going to talk about, and a whole lot more. From the founders, to the technological research and achievements, the products and funding, and how their mission has shifted overtime.\nThis is The Untold Story of OpenAI.\n\n------------------------\n\n\ud83d\udc31\u200d\ud83d\ude80 GitHub: https://github.com/forrestknight\n\ud83d\udc26 Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/forrestpknight\n\ud83d\udcbc LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/forrestpknight\n\ud83d\udcf8 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/forrestpknight\n \n\ud83d\udcd3 Learning Resources: \nMy Favorite Machine Learning Course:  https://imp.i384100.net/YgYEBJ\nOpen Source Computer Science Degree:  https://bit.ly/open-source-forrest\nPython Open Source Computer Science Degree:  https://bit.ly/python-open-source\nUdacity to Learn Any Coding Skill: http://bit.ly/udacity-forrest\n\n\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb My Coding Gear:\nMy NAS Server: https://amzn.to/3brqO7b\nMy Hard Drives: https://amzn.to/3aKetMi\nMy Main Monitor: https://amzn.to/3siQfPa\nMy Second Monitor: https://amzn.to/3keHT84\nMy Standing Desk: https://amzn.to/3boAcbC\nMy PC Build:  https://bit.ly/my-coding-gear\nMy AI GPU: https://amzn.to/3uvmUmz", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o07kRSvz7yM", "date_published": "2023-04-04 13:00:36+00:00", "persistent": true, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US", "tags": ["artificial intelligence"]}]
