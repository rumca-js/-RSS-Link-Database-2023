This is the story of how Microsoft overtook what was once a non-profit company for humanity and turned it into a for-profit company doing Microsoft's bidding to get them ahead in the AI race.

In 2015, a non-profit company called OpenAI was founded by world-class research engineers and scientists, and funded by a group of the biggest names in Silicon Valley, who collectively donated $1B. 
They are the AI research and deployment company behind a couple products that you‚Äôve probably heard of, like DALL-E-2 and ChatGPT. 
When founded, they had one goal in mind: to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return.
But earlier this year on January 23, 2023, OpenAI accepted a $10B investment from Microsoft, on top of Microsoft‚Äôs previous investment of $1 Billion dollars in 2019, making Microsoft a reported 49% stakeholder, receiving 75% of OpenAI‚Äôs profits until it secures its investment return. 
At face value, it looks like any other investment into a budding, thriving company. But is it? Because just after Microsoft‚Äôs initial investment in 2019, OpenAI legally restructured from a non-profit company to a ‚Äúcapped‚Äù for-profit company, with ongoing collaborations exclusively with Microsoft.
So, how did we get here? Why did OpenAI go from a non-profit for humanity to a for-profit that's heavily intertwined with Microsoft? And what has OpenAI accomplished?
Well in this video, that‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm going to talk about, and a whole lot more. From the founders, to the technological research and achievements, the products and funding, and how their mission has shifted overtime.
This is The Untold Story of OpenAI.
