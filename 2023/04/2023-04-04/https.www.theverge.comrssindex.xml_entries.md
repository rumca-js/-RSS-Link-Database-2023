  <p id="FxMTH7">Asus’ ROG Ally, a Steam Deck-like handheld gaming PC, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/1/23666084/asus-rog-ally-handheld-windows-gaming-portable">is actually real</a>. But because of the messy and ill-informed communications about the device that, of course, involved April Fools’ Day, you’d be forgiven for not knowing that. Companies, take note: please don’t follow Asus’ lead next year.</p>
<p id="GVKK3l">The confusion started with an announcement at midnight on April 1st <a href="https://twitter.com/ASUS_ROG/status/1642013920956420098?cxt=HHwWhMDUrcO9zcktAAAA">“revealing” the handheld</a>. The video felt somewhat tongue-in-cheek, especially during one moment when someone is locked out of their house and happily remembers they have the Ally in their jacket pocket. The tagline felt April Fools’-y — “you’ll never have to stop gaming again” — and the video concluded with somebody using the Ally on a roller coaster and a go-kart.</p>

  <p id="4aGsxq">Activision is cracking down on third-party hardware cheating in <em>Call of Duty: Warzone </em>and <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II</em>. Devices like XIM, Cronus Zen, and ReaSnow S1 have been widely used in <em>Call of Duty</em> to allow mouse and keyboard users to get the benefits of aim assist and reduced recoil from controller mixed with the benefits of movement from mouse and keyboard.

Lifeweaver’s addition to the game had been teased by the <em>Overwatch</em> developers in the last few weeks, <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/overwatch/overwatch-2-devs-spill-details-on-cute-support-hero-coming-in-season-4-2086261/">with them calling the new hero “cute,”</a> leading some in the <em>Overwatch</em> community to speculate that we’d be getting another animal-based hero like the much-desired “<a href="https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki/Jetpack_Cat">jetpack cat</a>.” </p>

  <p id="huJy96">Bob Ross has become one of those inescapable facets of the internet. The longtime <em>The</em> <em>Joy of Painting</em> host is firmly entrenched in the realm of online kitsch, featured everywhere from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/30/9646026/twitch-bob-ross-gone-wrong">Twitch streams</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/17/16670170/deadpool-2-teaser-trailer-ryan-reynolds">Marvel ads</a> to <a href="https://secretlair.wizards.com/us/product/614995/happy-little-gathering"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em> sets</a>. His distinct and goofy persona makes him a logical subject for a similarly silly biopic — which is exactly what director Brit McAdams tries to do in <em>Paint</em>. Unfortunately, the film never finds enough of a hook to justify being a feature-length movie; you can get the entire joke mostly from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23590788/paint-trailer-date-owen-wilson-bob-ross-release-date">watching the trailer</a>. The result is a 90-minute feature that would’ve been better served as a <em>Saturday Night Live</em> sketch.</p>

  <p id="b0lGkI"><em>Pokémon Stadium</em> will join Nintendo’s growing roster of Nintendo 64 classics you can play through Nintendo Switch Online <a href="https://youtu.be/2j4IksCvaM4">starting April 12th</a>. First released in 2000, <em>Stadium</em> is a battle-focused <em>Pokémon</em> game featuring the original 151 pocket monsters. </p>
<p id="O5nxNy">The thing is, this version of <em>Stadium</em> has a very big catch (no pun intended): you can’t transfer any of your own pokémon to the game. When I was a kid, part of the appeal of the game was bringing over my well-trained <em>Pokémon Red</em> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_Pak">the N64 Transfer Pak</a> so they could duke it out in glorious N64-era 3D. Without the transfer feature, it seems you’ll have to instead rely on the game’s rental teams, which probably won’t be as satisfying as coaching my own beloved Butterfree to victory.</p>

<p id="Lz2lNq">According to Ryder, the company plans on adding the 2023 Zevo 600 vans to its rental fleet in California, Texas, and New York later this year and also expects to deploy the 2024 Zevo 600 and 400 models “as early as summer 2023 and into the first quarter of 2024.” While BrightDrop’s Zevo 600 and Zevo 400 vans both offer up to 250 miles of range on a full charge, the 600 is the larger of the two, supporting a cargo capacity of over 600 cubic feet as opposed to 400 cubic feet.</p>

<p id="JjYBuA">In a Monday letter, DeSantis called on Florida’s chief inspector general to investigate whether Disney and its closely aligned special district broke the law by approving new rules undermining the Republican governor’s proposed takeover. The takeover is widely viewed as retaliation after Disney opposed Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” law — one of multiple DeSantis-signed bills limiting speech in both the public and private sectors.</p>

  <p id="FkXQhX"><em>Crusader Kings 3</em> doesn’t have boss fights or puzzles like many other kinds of video games. But I am convinced that it does have one kind of enemy: its user interface.</p>
<p id="5C2Mrc">And yet, it’s one of the rare games that I have stayed up all night playing, even knowing I work the next day. When it gets its hooks into me, they dig in deep. <em>Crusader Kings 3</em> is a strategy game where you play as a landowner during the Latin holy wars. It’s open-ended, and the goals are driven by the player, but most people play with the intention of creating an empire that’s larger than any other on the map through subterfuge, war, diplomacy, or just buying everyone out. </p>
<p id="7F5MOH">If that sounds exciting, then I’m here to tell you that most of the game asks players to look at a...</p>

## Elon Musk’s obsession with blue checks is a verified problem

  <p id="Bj95ss">“Elon [Musk]’s Twitter deal certainly must also rank as the most time-adjusted value-destructive leveraged buyout of all time,” <a href="https://puck.news/dimon-diplomacy-more-zazonomics/">says William Cohan, writing for <em>Puck</em></a>. While Musk has estimated Twitter’s value as $20 billion in a March 31st email to employees — meaning its value dropped by more than half after the $44 billion acquisition — Twitter’s actual value is even lower than that. The banks still own $13 billion of Twitter’s debt and can’t sell it for more than 50 cents on the dollar, Cohan says. “The destruction of $37.5 billion in value in less than six months must have set some sort of Wall Street record.”</p>

  <p id="FJLwYt">A new TV series based on the original seven Harry Potter books could be on the way, according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-03/warner-bros-nears-deal-for-a-new-harry-potter-television-series?leadSource=uverify%20wall&amp;sref=ExbtjcSG">report from <em>Bloomberg</em></a> citing two individuals with knowledge of the as-yet-unsigned deal. It’s reportedly hoped that the series will be a cornerstone of Warner Bros. Discovery’s new streaming strategy, which will involve <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/4/23292742/hbo-max-discovery-plus-combo-streaming-app">replacing its existing HBO Max and Discovery Plus platforms with a new combined service</a>.</p>
<p id="nbHWUs">Warner Bros. originally adapted the Harry Potter books into a series of eight films starring Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint between 2001 and 2011. But according to <em>Bloomberg</em>, turning each book into a whole season of TV will “allow the writers to delve further” into the original stories. </p>

  <p id="26d1sK">Motorola hasn’t had much of a presence in the flagship phone space in the past couple of years, but that might be about to change. The company is unveiling the Edge 40 Pro, which is a global version of <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-moto-x40-g53-launch">the X40 it released in China</a> at the end of last year. It comes with a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset, a 6.67-inch display with up to 165Hz refresh rate, and an IP68 rating for weather and dust resistance. </p>
<p id="RrajhQ">In short, it looks like a serious challenger on the Android flagship landscape — at least on paper. It’s coming to European markets “in the coming days” for €899.99 (about $980) and Latin American markets soon after.</p>

## Microsoft’s next Surface Dock might drop the proprietary connector for USB-C

  <p id="eYndVw">A new leak suggests the next Surface Dock might use Thunderbolt 4 over USB-C to connect to Microsoft’s laptop lineup, rather than the company’s proprietary Surface connector. <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/laptops/microsofts-upcoming-surface-dock-3-drops-proprietary-connector-adds-thunderbolt-4-support"><em>Windows Central</em> reports</a> that the device is codenamed Bergamo, and says pictures of it have leaked via <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F325580171739%3Fsearch%3Dcw%26mkevt%3D1%26mkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26campid%3D5337827784%26customid%3Dwp-gb-2068282584171881700&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2023%2F4%2F4%2F23669313%2Fmicrosoft-surface-dock-usb-c-thunderbolt-4-connector" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">this eBay listing</a>.</p>
<p id="1hDeLz">While other accessory manufacturers have embraced USB-C as the single connector of choice, Microsoft still prefers to use its own Surface connector to dock its laptops with external monitors and other accessories. It’s meant that devices like the $259.99 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21247234/microsoft-surface-dock-2-usb-c-hub-keyboard-mouse-price">Surface Dock 2</a> only work with Microsoft’s own gear, an unfortunate limitation given the cost.</p>
