[{"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Microsoft\u2019s new Surface Thunderbolt 4 Dock ditches tradition", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Today Microsoft launched the Surface Thunderbolt 4 Dock, noteworthy for one key absence: the Surface Connector, which has now been replaced with a standard Thunderbolt 4 interface. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why is this important? For years, Microsoft Surface devices were driven <em>and</em> charged via the Surface Connector, a unique and proprietary charging port that transferred data and power to Surface devices. For Surface fans, this wasn&rsquo;t a problem: like early IBM ThinkPads, the charger and its proprietary charging port served as a convenient spare through successive generations. As laptops tried out different iterations of barrel chargers, the consistency was an advantage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, as the USB-C hardware port and the related Thunderbolt port protocol became more common, the need for a proprietary Surface connector diminished. Virtually all Thunderbolt docks now supply power as well as the standard 40Gbps of data, which satisfies both requirements. Microsoft&rsquo;s Surface Thunderbolt 4 Dock uses a 165W power brick, passing up to 96W to any connected laptops. And yes, we could see the writing on the wall&mdash;it rendered the older <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/811362/rip-surface-dock-microsofts-surface-sidekick-is-now-irrelevant.html\">Surface Docks irrelevant</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One surprise, really, was that Microsoft waited on the more <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/399348/intel-unveils-the-thunderbolt-4-spec-which-amd-believes-it-can-use.html\">stringent Thunderbolt 4 spec</a>, as opposed to debuting a Thunderbolt 3 dock, instead. Some even wondered whether Microsoft would just wait for what&rsquo;s informally known as the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1066919/intel-shows-off-next-gen-80gbps-thunderbolt.html\">80Gbps Thunderbolt spec</a>, which Intel has already shown off. We now know the answers to both questions.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget is-half-width is-float-right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"dont-own-a-thunderbolt-display-you-may-need-one-of-these-cables\">\n\t\t\t\t\tDon't Own a Thunderbolt DIsplay?

Instead, there&rsquo;s a front-facing Thunderbolt 4 port to connect to the PC (plus a 31-inch Thunderbolt 4 cable) and two rear-facing Thunderbolt 4 ports as well. That implies that you&rsquo;ll either need a USB-C (Thunderbolt) to DisplayPort cable, or else bet on Thunderbolt displays becoming a thing. So far, Thunderbolt inputs are usually only associated with high-end displays. Otherwise, you&rsquo;ll need a second Thunderbolt dock or <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/402858/the-best-usb-c-hubs-for-your-laptop-tablet-or-2-in-1.html\">USB-C dongle</a> to route the signal.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Microsoft Surface Thunderbolt 4 Dock\" class=\"wp-image-1682888\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Microsoft-Surface-Thunderbolt-4-Dock-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Microsoft&rsquo;s Surface Thunderbolt 4 Dock, and the rear ports. </figcaption></figure><a class=\"imageCredit\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/surface-thunderbolt%E2%84%A2-4-dock/8X7CGH1N2TB2&amp;xcust=2-2-1682858-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft</a></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Surface Thunderbolt 4 Dock uses Microsoft&rsquo;s dock aesthetic: a black brick. It also includes a front-facing 10Mbps USB-A port (supplying 7.5W to charge your smartphone) and two identical USB-A ports on the rear. There is also a 2.5Gbps Ethernet port, a 3.5mm audio jack, and a screw nut for a desk mount. (If the USB-A ports don&rsquo;t supply enough power for your phone, you can use a free Thunderbolt 4 port and its 15W of power.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, the Surface Thunderbolt 4 Dock is optimized for the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1357810/microsoft-surface-laptop-5-review-for-surface-fans-only.html\">Surface Laptop 5</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/538948/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-review-the-future-is-here.html\">Surface Laptop Studio</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/538941/microsoft-surface-pro-8-review\">Surface Pro 8</a>, and the Surface Pro 9&mdash;though only the Intel version, and not the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1357826/microsoft-surface-pro-9-5g-review-an-arm-tablet-worth-buying.html\">Surface Pro 9&rsquo;s Arm variant</a>. It&rsquo;s compatible with devices that include a USB-C port, but <em>not</em> Thunderbolt: the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1357826/microsoft-surface-pro-9-5g-review-an-arm-tablet-worth-buying.html\">Surface Pro 9 with 5G</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/394062/microsoft-surface-pro-7-review-a-giant-leap-in-graphics-performance.html\">Surface Pro 7+</a>, and earlier devices. The difference between the two is essentially the number of supported displays: USB-C ports <em>without</em> Thunderbolt can support a 1080p or single 4K display, while a Thunderbolt port has enough bandwidth to support a pair of 4K displays at 60Hz for optimum productivity.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Microsoft Surface Dock in box\" class=\"wp-image-811389\" height=\"726\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Surface-Dock-in-box.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>The older Surface Docks, with their proprietary Surface Connectors, are now largely irrelevant.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>What does this mean for future Surface devices?

While functionally solid, the core program lacks many of the features we&rsquo;ve come to expect from modern password managers such as password capture and replay, password auditing, dark web monitoring, and a native mobile app. On the plus side, it offers a high degree of customizability but requires a certain technical proficiency to take advantage of it, something the average user probably doesn&rsquo;t have.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"keepass-getting-started\">KeePass: Getting started</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re one of those average users, things get muddy the moment you go to download KeePass. There are two editions, 1.x and 2.x, and developers continue to support both. However, there&rsquo;s little to guide your decision about which version to download. KeePass provides a link to an edition comparison page, which states the two editions are &ldquo;fundamentally different (2.x is not based on 1.x).&rdquo; But many of the differentiators are tough to decipher if you don&rsquo;t have the requisite technical background. In the end, I chose the latest release of edition 2.x because it supports additional security features that 1.x doesn&rsquo;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>Note: See our roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407092/best-password-managers-reviews-and-buying-advice.html\">best password managers</a> to learn about competing products, what to look for in a password manager, and product recommendations.</em></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the KeePass installation is complete, an empty password database window appears with virtually every button grayed out and no instructions on how to get started. After returning to the KeePass web page and poking around a bit, I stumbled upon a &ldquo;<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://keepass.info/help/base/firststeps.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1668328-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">first steps tutorial</a>&rdquo; that describes basic usage.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"KeePass\" class=\"wp-image-1668329\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/KeePass-database.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>Upon installation, KeePass launches an empty database window, but you&rsquo;ll need to consult support documentation for instructions on how to get started.&nbsp;</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Ansaldo/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>You first have to create a new database, by selecting&nbsp;<em>File &gt; New</em>&nbsp;in the main menu. You&rsquo;ll be asked where to store the database file; KeePass stores your database locally on your device rather than in the cloud, which greatly reduces the likelihood of a breach. Next, you&rsquo;re prompted to create a master password. There&rsquo;s also a checkbox here to display&nbsp;&ldquo;expert options,&rdquo; which allows you to enable multi-factor authentication for your KeePass account. You can either create a key file, which you&rsquo;ll have to install on a USB drive that will have to be plugged into your computer when accessing your database, or you can<em>&nbsp;</em>attach the data to your Windows user account.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After you&rsquo;ve created your master password, you can see your database. KeePass shows its age. The database is a bare-bones window. A menu on the left sorts your passwords into groupings circa 2003 (Networks, Internet, eMail, etc.), and your passwords for the active group are listed in a larger pane on the right.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"keepass-features\">KeePass: Features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Importing passwords from other databases is pretty straightforward. KeePass can import from more than 40 other password managers, including popular commercial options such as Dashlane, Bitwarden, and LastPass, as well as from Firefox and Chrome browsers.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"KeePass\" class=\"wp-image-1668330\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/KeePass-master-pw.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>KeePass rates the quality of your master password.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Ansaldo/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding and creating new passwords takes a lot more work. Unlike modern password managers, KeePass does not have a browser extension that automatically captures and replays login credentials as you use and update them. Any credentials not included in your initial import have to be added to your database manually one by one. New entries automatically populate with a 20-character generated password containing lowercase and uppercase letters and numbers. KeePass&rsquo; password generator offers a dizzying array of options for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://keepass.info/help/base/pwgenerator.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1668328-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">how passwords are generated</a>, but most of these are probably beyond the scope of the average user&rsquo;s needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most commercial password managers fill in your login credentials on secure sites either automatically or when you select the site&rsquo;s entry from a browser extension. KeePass instead uses something called Auto-Type. It uses a sequence of keystrokes that simulate the act of you manually typing in your login credentials. When you invoke this sequence by pressing Ctrl-V in a login window, KeePass essentially performs those keystrokes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The default keystroke sequence is set to {USERNAME}{TAB}{PASSWORD}{ENTER}. In other words, KeePass will simulate typing your username, tabbing to the next field, typing your password, and then pressing enter when you invoke Auto-Type. If a particular website requires a different sequence of keystrokes, you&rsquo;ll have to define a new Auto-Type sequence for that entry in your database.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"KeePass\" class=\"wp-image-1668332\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/KeePass-auto-type.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><p>KeePass Auto-Type uses a defined sequence of keystrokes to populate your login credentials on websites.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Ansaldo/Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Auto-type works but it&rsquo;s not particularly user-friendly. You have to be sure your cursor is in the right input field before you invoke Auto-Type or it won&rsquo;t work. I also found that the feature didn&rsquo;t work as expected on every site, in which case I had to simply copy and paste my credentials, toggling between the site and my KeePass database.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to passwords, you can store credit cards, notes, and other sensitive personal information in KeePass. But as with passwords, it typically takes more steps and tweaking than in other password managers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"keepass-syncing\">KeePass: Syncing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>KeePass also allows you to sync your databases across devices but it&rsquo;s not as straightforward as with cloud-based password managers. The base program supports syncing database files to other devices using local network shares, FTP, HTTP, and WebDAV. Things get trickier if you want to use the cloud to store and sync your database. Popular options like Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive, and Google Drive may provide an integration that allows you to access your stored files using Windows Explorer. If not, you&rsquo;ll have to find a specialized KeePass plugin to help do the job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of plugins, KeePass has more than 100 that facilitate everything from backup to importing and exporting data, to integrating with third-party applications. If you decide to use KeePass, you&rsquo;ll want to familiarize yourself with these because many bring the program&rsquo;s capabilities on par with modern password managers, adding features like automated password capture and replay, password change reminders, and cloud syncing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"should-you-use-keepass-password-manager\">Should you use KeePass password manager?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This customizability means you can shape KeePass to your precise needs if you&rsquo;re willing to put in the work. Most users, though, are turning to password managers to reduce complexity and mental labor, not increase it.

You have to live in the right neighborhood for those, and I don&rsquo;t. A big portion of the San Francisco Bay Area doesn&rsquo;t, either. And that has real effects on internet speeds. Just look at what AT&amp;T says it can do for the west side of San Francisco&rsquo;s Mission District:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow aligncenter\"><div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_container swiper-container\"><ul class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper\"><li class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide\"><figure><img alt=\"Painful AT&amp;T internet plans (SF Mission District) part 2\" class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-1681391\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/dang-that-hurts-2.png?w=1200\" /></figure></li><li class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide\"><figure><img alt=\"Painful AT&amp;T internet plans (SF Mission District) part 1\" class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-1681392\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/dang-that-hurts.png?w=1200\" /></figure></li><li class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide\"><figure><img alt=\"Painful AT&amp;T internet plans (SF Mission District) part 3\" class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_image wp-image-1681393\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/dang-that-hurts-3.png?w=1200\" /></figure></li></ul><a class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-prev swiper-button-prev swiper-button-white\"></a><a class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-next swiper-button-next swiper-button-white\"></a><a class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_button-pause\"></a><div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_pagination swiper-pagination swiper-pagination-white\"></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em><sup>These addresses were sampled from current Redfin listings. Meanwhile, on the east side of the Mission District&mdash;just nine blocks away&mdash;1 Gbps plans are available.</sup></em> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, the Mission District is lucky in that Comcast and Sonic also serve the area with higher speeds, provided you can get wired up appropriately. (Hope you don&rsquo;t have a cantankerous landlord.) But even then, you might not be guaranteed better internet speeds. Service providers tout their fastest download speeds while burying their upload speeds, and those upload speeds are generally bad. Unless you have access to fiber with symmetrical down and up, you&rsquo;re likely stuck at a paltry 10 Mbps&mdash;maybe 15 or 20 if you have a faster plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It sucks. And if you&rsquo;re into streaming video, it sucks hard. Much of the U.S. is like this&mdash;maybe swap in the names Cox or Spectrum for Comcast, but the story isn&rsquo;t different. If you&rsquo;re a US resident, you&rsquo;re already aware of this, especially if you live in a less urban region. But for those living elsewhere, let me finish illustrating this for you: You know what upload speed AT&amp;T pairs with its 18 Mbps plan? Just <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://about.att.com/sites/broadband/performance#:~:text=Internet%2018&amp;xcust=2-1-1680274-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">1 Mbps per second</a>. That&rsquo;s slow enough to affect your ability to video chat or even present a slide deck over a call. A cell phone&rsquo;s connection performs better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s not going to get better quickly, either. Infrastructure rollout is slow and inconsistent. What&rsquo;s going to save the day is better technology&mdash;namely, AV1.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"AV1 YouTube stream of Halo at 4K 60fps\" class=\"wp-image-1681409\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/1-15.webp\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption>With AV1, you can stream in 4K 60 fps using only a 10 Mbps connection&mdash;with dramatically better results over most<span> 1080p 60 fps Twitch streams at 6 Mbps.</span> </figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Adam Taylor / PCWorld</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>AV1 is a protocol for video encoding and decoding, one that compresses high-quality, high-resolution video into much less space than current codecs like H.264 and V9. In other words, it lets people watch sharper, higher-resolution videos while burning less bandwidth (and taking less hard drive space for creators).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We dove into the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/827992/tested-intel-arc-av1-video-encoder-vs-nvidia-amd.html\">full details of AV1</a> when the first graphics card with encoding support launched last year, but in simpler terms, you can expect AV1 livestreams at 1440p and 4K to use the same bandwidth that it currently takes to push 720p and 1080p with the H.264 codec. On-demand videos encoded with AV1 also end up smaller, too, while retaining more detail. You can see the difference in <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/improving-video-quality-and-performance-with-av1-and-nvidia-ada-lovelace-architecture/#:~:text=The%20H.,faster%20than%20the%20x264%20encoder.&amp;xcust=2-1-1680274-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nvidia&rsquo;s sample video</a>, part of its own write-up on the subject to promote its latest RTX 40-series GPUs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you&rsquo;re capped to low internet speeds, you&rsquo;ll benefit from this codec. Infinitely more than yet another flyer stuffed in one&rsquo;s mailbox about internet plans that won&rsquo;t apply to your area for years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, the catch is that you need two things for AV1 to work its magic. First, you need hardware capable of decoding AV1 video (for watching) and/or encoding in AV1 (for creating video or streaming). Decoding is supported on <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/encode-and-decode-capabilities-for-7th-generation-intel-core-processors-and-newer.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1680274-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Intel 11th-gen CPUs and newer</a>, AMD Ryzen 6000 (mobile) and AMD Ryzen 7000 (desktop) CPUs, Nvidia RTX 30- and 40-series GPUs, AMD Radeon RX 6000- and 7000-series GPUs, and Intel Arc Alchemist GPUs.

That may sound tricky, since it&rsquo;s out of our control, but the good news is that adoption is already underway. Discord added support for <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://ptb.discord.com/blog/discord-update-february-20-2023-changelog/#:~:text=Livestream%20in%204K&amp;xcust=2-1-1680274-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">4K streaming over AV1 in late February</a>, and then just last week, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1674202/the-future-of-gpu-streaming-is-here-youtube-adds-av1-support.html\">YouTube added AV1 encoding</a> to pair with its existing AV1 decoding support. The latter news is huge, since it goes hand-in-hand with an update to <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/402776/obs-studio-review.html\">OBS</a> (one of the most popular streaming apps) that provides YouTube AV1 support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you own PC hardware that&rsquo;s not new enough for AV1, you might think this is as useful as another AT&amp;T advertisement for gigabit internet. But I think of it this way: The average starting price for an internet plan in my region is about $50 per month. On <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/comcast-increasing-internet-speeds-and-launches-new-2-gig-speed-across-northeast&amp;xcust=2-1-1680274-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Comcast</a> and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://about.att.com/sites/broadband/performance#:~:text=Internet%2018&amp;xcust=2-1-1680274-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">AT&amp;T</a>, that gets me an upload speed of 10 Mbps, which is barely passable for streaming gameplay to close friends over Discord.

Ouch.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could upgrade my internet to a $65 per month to get 20 Mbps uploads, which would give me more bandwidth for streams and make uploads of video files go much faster.

Sure. Do I expect AT&amp;T or Comcast to actually roll out reasonably symmetrical plans any time soon? Heck no. Comcast hasn&rsquo;t even fully deployed its faster upload speeds for its non-fiber plans in my region, much less its much-ballyhooed multi-gig speeds. And while 400 Mbps or higher download speeds sound nice, the extra $20 to $40 of savings per month can go toward groceries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So like with any situation where resources are limited, I have to make the most of what I&rsquo;ve got&mdash;and if you&rsquo;re in a similar boat, AV1 may be what comes to your rescue, too.</p>\n\nInternet</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1680274/u-s-internet-speeds-suck-but-av1-is-here-to-save-us.html", "date_published": "2023-04-04 14:54:09+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "IRS-certified free tax filing service caught spreading malware", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s tax season in the United States.

The very best AI art services offer superb imagery and superior tools, either for free or for a low price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why use AI art? Many of us can appreciate a great painting, photograph, or drawing, without the ability to draw it ourselves. We may also be able to describe what we want to see, and <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/788422/how-to-get-started-with-ai-art-dall-e-mini-ai-dungeon-and-more.html\">that&rsquo;s where AI art comes in</a>. Instead of searching for a piece of art that matches that description, the service actually generates it, matching what it knows of the scenes depicted in its image database and comparing them to the scene and style you specify.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All that complexity, however, demands intensive computing resources. AI art services tend to handle this in two ways: either limiting the generated images (either the number of images, or their resolution) or charging you &ldquo;credits&rdquo; or actual money to enable further subscriptions. We factor that in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, we can&rsquo;t ignore the legal and moral implications of AI art. Generative AI art was trained on a vast number of images &mdash; some public, some possibly private &mdash; and the services use that as a &ldquo;seed&rdquo; for the image they produce. Not all AI services are transparent about the source of their images. Companies like Getty Images feel that this is illegal, and <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1475597/getty-sues-stability-ai-and-the-future-of-ai-art-could-be-at-stake.html\">have filed suit</a>. The actual originality of AI art is in dispute, however, and AI proponents note that even human artists are typically trained or influenced by their exposure to existing art, whether public or private. Just know that you probably won&rsquo;t &ldquo;own&rdquo; a piece of AI art without some evidence that you yourself have altered it to make it an original work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Confused? We&rsquo;ll talk more about how to get started with AI art and some of the specifics of AI art terminology you might like to know (like inpainting) at the end of this story.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"toc\" id=\"the-best-ai-art-generators\">The best AI art generators</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"midjourney\">Midjourney</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Cost:</strong> free trial (on hold) /$10/$30/$60 per month</li><li><strong>Images:</strong> 25 prompts for the free trial, then varies</li><li><strong>Image license:</strong> Non-commercial use for the free trial, otherwise commercial use permitted except for large businesses</li><li><strong>NSFW/Celebs:</strong> No/Yes</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.midjourney.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1672975-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Midjourney</a> stands out as the unparalleled leader of AI art <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/820518/midjourneys-ai-art-goes-live-for-everyone.html\">since its launch last year</a> &mdash; though the magnificence of its images contrast rather ironically with the absolute clunkiness of its interface. Midjourney v5 (the current version as of press time) delivers the sort of hyperrealistic, fake images (<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1677533/midjourney-halts-free-trials-after-ai-photos-go-viral.html\">the Pope in a puffy jacket, say</a>) that generate news stories. &ldquo;Reality&rdquo; can now be artificially generated.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-jetpack-image-compare\"><div class=\"juxtapose\"><img alt=\"AI art Midjourney astronaut UI\" class=\"image-compare__image-before\" height=\"629\" id=\"1677994\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Midjourney-astronaut-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1156\" /><img alt=\"AI art Midjourney astronaut UI closeup screenshot\" class=\"image-compare__image-after\" height=\"1276\" id=\"1677998\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Midjourney-astronaut-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"2189\" /></div><figcaption>Midjourney&rsquo;s UI is actually on Discord, where users can enter public prompts and see the images others generate. We&rsquo;ve zoomed in on a screenshot taken from Discord, showing the final photorealistic result.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Midjourney uses Discord as its interface because the startup didn&rsquo;t want to invest in any infrastructure. You&rsquo;ll need to sign up for <em>that</em> app, then drop into one of the &ldquo;newbie&rdquo; Discord channels and use the <strong>/imagine</strong> command to prompt the service with your request for AI art. (Here&rsquo;s a guide to <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/540080/how-to-use-discord-a-beginners-guide.html\">getting started with Discord</a> if you need it.) Midjourney charges at least $10 per month for its basic plan, with additional tiers for $30/mo and $60/mo. <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1677533/midjourney-halts-free-trials-after-ai-photos-go-viral.html\">Midjourney put a free trial on hold</a>. There are ways to buy more a la carte time, to use a slower &ldquo;relaxed&rdquo; mode, and more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each prompt generates four images, any of which can be chosen for &ldquo;variation,&rdquo; as well as upscaling. Inpainting is also possible. You can open the image either in Discord or a browser to download it. Midjourney says that you can use its generated images &ldquo;in just about any way you want,&rdquo; which includes ownership of those images, subject to its terms of service. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-jetpack-image-compare\"><div class=\"juxtapose\"><img alt=\"AI art Midjourney Bill Gates skateboard\" class=\"image-compare__image-before\" height=\"1048\" id=\"1677997\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Midjourney-UI.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1509\" /><img alt=\"AI art Midjourney Bill Gates skateboard variations\" class=\"image-compare__image-after\" height=\"1049\" id=\"1677996\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Midjourney-Gates-variations.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1546\" /></div><figcaption>Each of the four Midjourney images can either be upscaled or you can ask for variations on them, as shown here. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s reiterate: Midjourney images are magnificent, and, since they&rsquo;re public, you can see other users generate images in real time as well as browse a gallery of historical images. The magic of Midjourney is how it typically delivers a good image routinely. But using it is a lot like a command-line version of Photoshop: there are <em>tons</em> of available tweaks, and they&rsquo;re not obvious at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"microsoft-bing-chat-creative-mode\">Microsoft Bing Chat (Creative Mode)</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Cost:</strong> Free with Microsoft account</li><li><strong>Images:</strong> Apparently unlimited</li><li><strong>Image license: </strong>Unclear</li><li><strong>NSFW/Celebs:</strong> No/Some</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Normally, we&rsquo;d highlight <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1666493/hands-on-with-bing-image-creator-bing-chats-ai-art-tool.html\">Bing Image Creator</a> as Microsoft&rsquo;s AI image contribution. The AI-powered <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1419066/microsoft-designer-is-almost-a-masterpiece-already.html\">Microsoft Designer</a>, too, is excellent. But weirdly, we like <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bing.com/chat&amp;xcust=2-1-1672975-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bing Chat</a> (specifically, its Creative Mode) as a top AI art generator for one specific reason: iterations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All three of Microsoft&rsquo;s AI art services are essentially free <em>and</em> apparently unlimited, provided that you have a Microsoft account and managed to get through the waitlist for Bing Chat and Image Creator. (Image Creator has an odd &ldquo;boost&rsquo; system which may or may not be in play here, but Microsoft doesn&rsquo;t seem to flag any limits on the number of images you can generate, which is a huge selling point.) Microsoft doesn&rsquo;t claim to own any of the images it generates, but it doesn&rsquo;t say that you own them, either.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-jetpack-image-compare\"><div class=\"juxtapose\"><img alt=\"AI art Microsoft Bing Chat modifications fruit\" class=\"image-compare__image-before\" height=\"1816\" id=\"1678038\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Bing-Chat-UI-modification.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1978\" /><img alt=\"AI art Microsoft Bing Image Creator stored images\" class=\"image-compare__image-after\" height=\"1241\" id=\"1678040\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Bing-Image-Creator-stored-images.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"2403\" /></div><figcaption>You can ask for AI art within Bing Chat, but the images will be stored in Bing Image Creator.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, all you need to do is go to Bing Chat and enter a prompt like &ldquo;draw me a&hellip;&rdquo; followed by a description of the image. Bing will then take a few moments and generate four 1,024&times;1,024 images that you can click on to see more clearly and download them. Bing won&rsquo;t draw celebrities like Bill Gates or Donald Trump, but Brad Pitt is just fine, apparently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft uses a trained version of the DALL-E 2 model, and the results are, subjectively, just a step below Midjourney. Bing Chat doesn&rsquo;t seem to allow inpainting, you can do something that not all other AI art generators do: incrementally iterate on a scene. By that, we mean that we could prompt it to: &ldquo;draw a basket of fruit&rdquo; and then, in the next prompt, ask it to adjust a detail of the scene. (It won&rsquo;t edit the scene, however, just download another image.)</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-jetpack-image-compare\"><div class=\"juxtapose\"><img alt=\"AI art Microsoft Bing Image Creator wrestler\" class=\"image-compare__image-before\" height=\"1282\" id=\"1678037\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Bing-Image-Creator-wrestler.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"2287\" /><img alt=\"AI art Microsoft Bing Image Creator future of AI\" class=\"image-compare__image-after\" height=\"1272\" id=\"1678039\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Bing-Image-Creator-future-of-AI.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"2403\" /></div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What Bing Chat doesn&rsquo;t seem to do itself, however, is archive images. You&rsquo;ll need to promptly (heh) download them or visit Bing Image Creator, where you&rsquo;ll find them hidden.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"playground-ai\">Playground AI</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Cost:</strong> Free / $15 per mo.</li><li><strong>Images:</strong> 1,000 per day (free) / 2,000 per day (paid)</li><li><strong>Image license:</strong> You own them, even for commercial use</li><li><strong>NSFW/Celebs:</strong> No/Yes</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Though Microsoft Bing Chat probably wins out in terms of its absolute simplicity, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://playgroundai.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1672975-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Playground AI</a> is probably the cheapest, simplest, yet most comprehensive way to sample AI art for yourself. With nothing more than a Google account, you can sign up for Playground and its 1,000 free images per day. (Some quality and size details are limited after 50 daily images.)</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-jetpack-image-compare\"><div class=\"juxtapose\"><img alt=\"Best AI art generators Playground AI basic UI\" class=\"image-compare__image-before\" height=\"866\" id=\"1679509\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Playground-AI-basic-UI.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1651\" /><img alt=\"Best AI art generators Playground AI image editing\" class=\"image-compare__image-after\" height=\"1025\" id=\"1679511\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Playground-AI-editing.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1461\" /></div><figcaption>Playground AI provides a very nicely designed UI for AI art generation, but its AI editing features may need some tweaking. One of its strengths, though, is in outpainting, which we describe in the glossary at the end of this story.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Playground&rsquo;s UI is very well designed, with prompt information and styles on the left rail, with adjustable sizing, weighting, and other tweaks to the right. The generated images aren&rsquo;t quite as good as Bing or Midjourney, but it&rsquo;s a very small step down, if that. About the only limitation are the available models: just Stable Diffusion 1.5 and 2.1, which will suffice for many people. (Access to DALL-E 2 costs an extra $10/mo.) You can play around with celebrity images if that&rsquo;s your thing, but NSFW images are a no-no.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where Playground shines, though, is in editing. Like Bing, you can edit created images through additional prompts, whether it be the whole thing or just a portion (inpainting). Playground calls this the Canvas, a beta feature that needs some work &mdash; the transition from creation to editing (via prompt) to editing (via in- and out-painting) is rougher than it needs to be. Otherwise, this service really delivers.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Best AI art generators Playground AI sample images\" class=\"wp-image-1679510\" height=\"842\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Playground-AI-samples.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>Som e example images I created with Playground AI.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"adobe-firefly\">Adobe Firefly</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Cost: TBD</strong></li><li><strong>Images:</strong> Unlimited, at least in beta</li><li><strong>Image license:</strong> Non-commercial usage only while in beta</li><li><strong>NSFW/Celebs:</strong> No/No</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Adobe is a major player in creative design, so it makes sense that all of its tools will incorporate AI to some extent. <a href=\"https://adobe.prf.hn/click/camref:1011lroIY/pubref:2-1-1672975-1-0-0/destination:https://firefly.adobe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Adobe Firefly</a> represents Adobe&rsquo;s first public steps in that direction. Currently in beta, Firefly is built upon copyright-free or openly-licensed images, or images it itself has owned. Maybe for that reason, Firefly images <em>look</em> professional &mdash; a self-fulfilling cycle, maybe, given that you&rsquo;ve probably seen many images originally created from Adobe tools and Adobe stock.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-jetpack-image-compare\"><div class=\"juxtapose\"><img alt=\"AI art Adobe Firefly treehouse\" class=\"image-compare__image-before\" height=\"1317\" id=\"1678069\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Adobe-Firefly.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"2274\" /><img alt=\"AI art Adobe Firefly raccoon\" class=\"image-compare__image-after\" height=\"1345\" id=\"1678078\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Adobe-firefly-raccoon-fixed.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"2291\" /></div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, we don&rsquo;t know what Adobe will eventually charge for Firefly, or whether it will be a standalone product. We&rsquo;d expect the Firefly engine, at least, to land in Photoshop and Adobe&rsquo;s other tools. The beta currently offers an unlimited amount of text-to-image generative art as well text effects, or AI-generated textures applied to text via a prompt. Adobe also says that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;exploring&rdquo; inpainting, outpainting, turning 3D models into images, personalized AI models, sketch-to-image, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adobe&rsquo;s model doesn&rsquo;t seem as creatively free as some others, but makes up for it with its slick, professional look. Each prompt generates four images, which you can adjust with easy-to-parse stylistic adjustments from content type (photo, graphic, art) to styles (layered paper, fur, neon, palette knife) to color, tone, and lighting. Adjusting the image format changes the image, too. Just forget anything NSFW or with celebrities inside of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-jetpack-image-compare\"><div class=\"juxtapose\"><img alt=\"AI art Adobe Firefly double exposure\" class=\"image-compare__image-before\" height=\"1353\" id=\"1678072\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Adobe-Firefly-double-exposure.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"2283\" /><img alt=\"AI art Adobe Firefly robot\" class=\"image-compare__image-after\" height=\"1353\" id=\"1678071\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Adobe-Firefly-robot.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"2283\" /></div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Adobe Firefly seems to do best with images that have some connection to the real world and its stock imagery. Odd connections (&ldquo;a fly buzzing around a king&rsquo;s head&rdquo;) produce stunning visions of just one portion of the scene. Pros will love Firefly, which will undoubtedly be locked behind an expensive Creative Cloud subscription.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"stable-diffusion\">Stable Diffusion </h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Cost:</strong> Free</li><li><strong>Images:</strong> Unlimited</li><li><strong>Image license: </strong>Unclear</li><li><strong>NSFW/Celebs:</strong> Yes/Yes</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike cloud-based AI art services, a key selling point of Stable Diffusion is that it runs locally, on your PC &mdash; not on a server! If you want to create dozens of images of bikini-clad elves frolicking in pools of jello on Midjourney, the world is going to be able to see. Otherwise, if you have a <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407493/best-gaming-laptops.html\">powerful gaming laptop</a> or desktop, you can download the Stable Diffusion code and a variety of image models and training data and go to town on the privacy of your PC.

Instead, the key component seems to be your GPU&rsquo;s available VRAM. There are models and toggles and other options to tweak Stable Diffusion in favor of your CPU or lower-tier GPUs, but the easiest way to run Stable Diffusion is with a powerful PC.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"stable-horde-artbot\">Stable Horde (Artbot)</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Cost:</strong> Free</li><li><strong>Images:</strong> Unlimited, though subject to queuing</li><li><strong>Image license:</strong> Unclear</li><li><strong>NSFW/Celebs:</strong> Yes/Yes</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>So what happens if you <em>don&rsquo;t</em> have a powerful enough PC to run Stable Diffusion? Stable Horde is one answer. Like the old-school (now defunct) SETI@Home, all you&rsquo;re doing is sending your prompt out to a cluster of connected PCs running Stable Diffusion. There are a few front-end interfaces, but we rely on <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://tinybots.net/artbot&amp;xcust=2-1-1672975-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Artbot</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike Stable Diffusion&rsquo;s roots, Artbot uses a GUI that&rsquo;s somewhat navigable: prompt at the top, followed by a ton of available options and models. What Artbot offers are helpful tooltips that explain what those options do: how weighting the prompt affects it, negative prompting, and more. There&rsquo;s an extremely helpful list of the various models which you can use as a framework for your prompt, showing you visually how they&rsquo;ll affect the style of the output. The configurability is amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-jetpack-image-compare\"><div class=\"juxtapose\"><img alt=\"best AI art Stable Diffusion Artbot UI\" class=\"image-compare__image-before\" height=\"1272\" id=\"1678104\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Artbot-ui.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"2403\" /><img alt=\"best AI art Stable Diffusion Artbot example image\" class=\"image-compare__image-after\" height=\"1455\" id=\"1678106\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Artbot-pirate-image.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"2403\" /></div><figcaption>One of the best things about Stable Diffusion is its AI art models, which can often be hit or miss.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Stable Horde isn&rsquo;t really free, however. It works on a &ldquo;kudos&rdquo; system, where you&rsquo;ll need to sign up with an API key &mdash; a hurdle to unfamiliar users. After that, you&rsquo;ll start with a balance of kudos, which are subtracted with each image you generate. The more complex the image is, the more kudos it consumes. The fewer the kudos, the further back in the queue you&rsquo;ll end up with other users. That&rsquo;s not always a problem &mdash; with 30 or so PCs all working together to churn out images, you may find that your image is generated immediately. (Images are saved in a library on the site until you clear your cookies.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can &ldquo;buy&rdquo; kudos, however, by rating images, training the model on which images humans (you) prefer or connecting your PC to the Horde itself. While you can go into &ldquo;debt&rdquo; by frequently generating images, there are certain actions you can&rsquo;t take without an actual kudos &ldquo;balance&rdquo; to fund it. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"best AI art Stable Diffusion Artbot images\" class=\"wp-image-1678105\" height=\"526\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Artbot-selection-of-images.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>A collection of images I  generated with Artbot.</figcaption></figure><a class=\"imageCredit\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://tinybots.net/artbot&amp;xcust=2-1-1672975-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Artbot</a></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Why use Artbot? The vast number of AI models, and the variance in style those images produce. Otherwise, generating images via Artbot can be a bit of a crapshoot, and you may expend a great number of kudos simply exploring all the options. Since there&rsquo;s no real setup besides figuring out the API key, Stable Horde (Artbot) can be worth a try.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"runners-up-dall-e-mage-space-getimg-ai-and-dreamstudio-ai\">Runners-up: DALL-E, Mage.Space, Getimg.ai and DreamStudio AI</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Four AI art services stand out but don&rsquo;t make our list: OpenAI&rsquo;s own <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://labs.openai.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1672975-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dall-E</a>, Mage.Space, DreamStudio, and Getimg.ai. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1338403/the-grandfather-of-ai-art-dall-e-is-now-free-for-you-to-try.html\">wrote about DALL-E recently</a>, and some of the photo-like art generations are excellent. It just feels like OpenAI isn&rsquo;t too serious about it, though, and the pricing model (115 images for $15) doesn&rsquo;t make sense. Bing Chat&rsquo;s free images are trained on DALL-E, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.mage.space/&amp;xcust=2-1-1672975-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mage.Space</a> had a reputation for a very NSFW-like atmosphere, but the site phased all of that out recently. It has, however, left what it refers to as an absolutely unlimited amount of images, for free. (NSFW generations cost $4 per month, in part because credit cards can be a form of identification.) The site has what appears to over 40 very nice tuned generation models, but those are reserved for the $15/mo Pro plan.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"best AI art tools DALL-E\" class=\"wp-image-1679415\" height=\"765\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Dall_E-collection.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>A collection of images made with DALL-E.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://getimg.ai/&amp;xcust=2-1-1672975-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Getimg.ai</a> also offers an excellent variety of models with which to generate images, prompt-based editing, and even DreamBooth, which allows you to train a model on your own photos. Getimg.ai also implements ControlNet for image-to-image generation, an algorithm that specifically preserves characteristics of the original image (such as a pose) in image-to-image generation. A limit of 100 free images per month feels a trifle skimpy, however, though a $12/mo subscription earns you 3,000 images per month, upscaling, and access to the imaging models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time with <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://beta.dreamstudio.ai/generate&amp;xcust=2-1-1672975-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">DreamStudio AI</a> (which provided credits for us to try) but it just feels too limited (and still a beta?) right now. A flat fee of $10 buys you enough credits for 5,000 images, but there are only a handful of models, no editing, and images that don&rsquo;t stand out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For various reasons we ruled out Deep Dream Generator, Starry.ai, NightCafe, and Craiyon, which has devolved into a sea of ads.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"toc\" id=\"how-to-get-started-with-ai-art-the-basics\">How to get started with AI art: The basics</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in trying out AI art, remember that there are plenty of sites that will let you try out AI art for free &mdash; and you should. A Google account seems to be the default requirement, however, as many don&rsquo;t even offer the ability to choose a username and password. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Few AI art generations will look perfect on the first try. What sites like Midjourney do is help new users up. You can get a great result with just a very basic description.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, like any hobby, AI art has its own nerds. Some sites will refer to (and even offer tutorials on) &ldquo;prompt engineering,&rdquo; or tailoring your text prompt to get the result just so. What other sites offer as an alternative is a simple visual list of styles and models that you can choose from &mdash; and selecting those will add the proper text to the prompt itself. (It can be useful to understand just how synthwave differs from cyberpunk!) Some, unfortunately, lock these additional models behind a paywall. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re suddenly at a loss for what to create, think of tweaks to the real world: a dragon perched on the Brooklyn Bridge. The cute centaur at the end of the bar. You&rsquo;ll have even more fun with casting scenes in the styles of your favorite artists or photographers. Words matter, as does phrasing! Sometimes a phrase like &ldquo;while skateboarding&rdquo; may be misinterpreted, but &ldquo;riding a skateboard&rdquo; might not be.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Best AI art tools midjourney prompt\" class=\"wp-image-1679422\" height=\"1006\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/complex-prompt.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>You can  simply write a prompt like &ldquo;man sitting next to tent&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ll receive a result from an AI art service. But some people prefer to get very, very specific.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>You can often generate more than one image at a time, though it will often cost you in terms of credits or whatever the site uses to limit generations. Larger images will often require more credits, but this varies by service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think of a prompt in this way:  &ldquo;a photo/comic/woodcut of a squirrel/Marilyn Monroe/a fairy in the style of Van Gogh/Ansel Adams/Salvador Dali,&rdquo; where you choose one of each. Then add whatever modifiers you can think of: is the scene viewed through the branches of a tree? Shot with a Canon DSLR with a long lens? AI can accommodate more than you&rsquo;d think. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, almost everything. AI art also has one weakness: hands and fingers. Why? We&rsquo;re not sure, but it&rsquo;s such a common weakness that it&rsquo;s almost a meme! Some terms of service also allow NSFW images, while others don&rsquo;t &mdash; when you think about all of the awful things that people can imagine, this makes sense. Others don&rsquo;t care about allowing celebrity likenesses, such as former presidents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like someone skilled in Photoshop or Lightroom can need time to edit a photo, so can you. You may need a few dozen efforts to get things just so &mdash; and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s worth trying AI art on a site that allows multiple prompts, for cheap, to see if it&rsquo;s worth it. Try multiple sites, too! Additional editing tools like inpainting and outpainting can help fix errors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, inpainting. Don&rsquo;t know what that means? Neither did many of us until fairly recently. We&rsquo;ve included a glossary, below, to provide additional AI art definitions to help get you started. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Prompt: </strong>A simple (or complex!) text description that describes that the image portrays. This is affected by the prompt weight (see below).</li><li><strong>txt2img (text-to-image)</strong>: This is basically what we think of in terms of AI art: input a text prompt, generate an image.</li><li><strong>Negative prompt</strong>: Anything you <em>don&rsquo;t</em> want to see in the final image.</li><li><strong>img2img: (image to image</strong>): Instead of generating a scene from scratch, you can upload an image and use that as inspiration for the output image. Want to turn your dog into a king? Upload the dog&rsquo;s photo, <em>then</em> apply the AI art generation to the scene.</li><li><strong>Model:</strong> AI uses different generative models (Stable Diffusion 1.5 or 2.1 are the most common, though there are many others like DALL-E 2 and Midjourney&rsquo;s custom model) and each model will bring its own &ldquo;look&rdquo; to a scene. Experiment and see what works!</li><li><strong>Prompt weight:</strong> How closely the model and image adheres to the prompt. This is one variable you may want to tweak on the sites that allow it. Simply put, a strong prompt weight won&rsquo;t allow for much creativity by the AI algorithm, while a weak weight will. </li><li><strong>Sampler:</strong> Nothing you probably need to worry about, though different samplers also affect the look of an image. </li><li><strong>Steps:</strong> How many iterations an AI art generator will take to construct an image, generally improving the output. While many services will allow you to adjust this, a general rule of thumb is that anything over 50 steps offers diminishing improvements. One user uploaded a visual comparison of how <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://i.ibb.co/vm4fm7L/1661440027115223.jpg&amp;xcust=2-1-1672975-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">steps and samples affect the resulting image</a>.</li><li><strong>Face fixing:</strong> Some sites offer the ability to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; faces using algorithms like GFPGAN, which can make portraits look more lifelike.</li><li><strong>ControlNet:</strong> A new algorithm, and not widely used. ControlNet is specifically designed for image-to-image generation, &ldquo;locking&rdquo; aspects of the original image so they can&rsquo;t be changed. If you have an image of a black cat and want to change it to a calico, ControlNet could be used to preserve the original pose, simply changing the color.</li><li><strong>Upscaling:</strong> Default images are usually small, square, 1,024&times;1,024 images, though not always. Though upscaling often &ldquo;costs&rdquo; more in terms of time and computing resources, upscaling the image is one way to get a &ldquo;big&rdquo; image that you can use for other purposes besides just showing off to your friends on social media.</li><li><strong>Inpainting:</strong> This is a rather interesting form of image editing. Inpainting is basically like Photoshop plus AI: you can take an image and highlight a specific area, and then alter that area using AI. (You can also edit everything but the highlighted area, alternatively.) Imagine uploading a photo of your father, &ldquo;inpainting&rdquo; the area where his hair is, and then adding a crown or a clown&rsquo;s wig with AI.</li><li><strong>Outpainting:</strong> This uses AI to expand the bounds of the scene. Imagine you just have a small photo, shot on a beach in Italy. You could use outpainting to &ldquo;expand&rdquo; the shot, adding more of the (AI-generated) beach, perhaps a few birds or a distant building. It&rsquo;s not something you&rsquo;d normally think of!</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-jetpack-image-compare\"><div class=\"juxtapose\"><img alt=\"Best AI art generators outpainting original\" class=\"image-compare__image-before\" height=\"580\" id=\"1679493\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Outpainting-pre.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"856\" /><img alt=\"Best AI art generators Outpainting post\" class=\"image-compare__image-after\" height=\"458\" id=\"1679498\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Outpainting-post-fixed.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"687\" /></div><figcaption>AI cut off the image to the left for some reason, leaving the image with half a face. Outpainting uses AI to extrapolate what the rest of the scene should look like.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>AI art can be scary to a generation of artists who may now have to, perhaps unfairly, compete with machine-generated AI art. (Imagine what it&rsquo;s like for a writer to <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1671133/chatgpt-vs-bing-vs-bard-whats-the-best-ai-chatbot.html\">test AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Bing, and Google Bard</a>!) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, we choose to look at AI art as its own, unique, creative outlet, encouraging you to think about and create your own pieces. After all, you can buy food at a restaurant, or follow a recipe and combine ingredients yourself. Each has its place. Encouraging more people to become part of the creative process is what AI art is all about.</p>\n\nInternet</div>", "link": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/1672975/the-best-ai-art-generators-for-you-midjourney-bing-and-more.html", "date_published": "2023-04-04 10:45:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "title": "Logitech Pop Keys review: The mechanical keyboard for emoji addicts", "description": "<div id=\"link_wrapped_content\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-bigbite-multi-title\"><div class=\"container\"></div></section>\n\n\n<div class=\"review\" id=\"review-body\"><span class=\"review-title\">At a glance</span><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"experts-rating\">Expert's Rating</h3><div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n<div><div class=\"review-columns\"><div class=\"review-column\"><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"pros\">Pros</h3><ul class=\"pros review-list\"><li>Colorful and cute</li><li>Fast device switching</li><li>Easy emoji programming </li></ul></div><div class=\"review-column\"><h3 class=\"review-subTitle\" id=\"cons\">Cons</h3><ul class=\"cons review-list\"><li>Expensive </li><li>No rechargeable battery</li><li>Emojis only work on Windows and Mac</li></ul></div></div></div><h3 class=\"review-subTitle review-subTitle--borderTop\" id=\"our-verdict\">Our Verdict</h3><p class=\"verdict\">The Pop Keys is an exercise in style over substance.

divisions. So when I say that the Pop Keys is unique, that actually means something. You won&rsquo;t find anything else quite like it from such a mainstream brand. The combination of mechanical practicality and fun style is something that should have broad appeal, or at least be more visually interesting than the usual gray-and-black rectangles. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&rsquo;s the greatest strength of the Pop Keys&mdash;what we have here is a classic case of style over substance. While the board is perfectly adequate, in the same way that most of Logitech&rsquo;s consumer-focused keyboards are, the corners cut on the design combined with its high price make it hard to recommend. Unless, of course, you just love that bubbly, curvy look with its dedicated emoji keys.  </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>Further reading:</strong> See our roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/414972/best-wireless-keyboards.html\">best wireless keyboards</a> to learn about competing products.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"the-logitech-pop-keys-design\">The Logitech Pop Keys design</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The most striking thing about the Pop Keys is its visual design. With perfectly rounded keycaps and a soft plastic body that looks like a big, squishy pillow, it has more curves than Mulhollond Drive. It&rsquo;s also packing a column of five dedicated emoji keys along the left side, with four spare keycaps in case you want to switch them around. Our review unit came in a gray-on-white &ldquo;Mist&rdquo; color, but there are four other, far more vibrant options to choose from, including a wild combination of pastel yellow, purple, and green called &ldquo;<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards/pop-keys-wireless-mechanical.920-010708.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1676470-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Daydream</a>.&rdquo; </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Logitech Pop Keys emoji right\" class=\"wp-image-1677569\" height=\"676\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/DSC00382.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>But don&rsquo;t let the bubbly design fool you. Underneath those round keycaps are standard Cherry clone switches&mdash;brown ones, to be precise, for a slight tactile &ldquo;bump&rdquo; that&rsquo;s pretty loud with all that plastic. The keyboard is also wireless, with Logitech&rsquo;s standard combination of Bluetooth, RF (USB dongle in the box), and multi-device switching. The layout is the popular 75 percent size, as seen on such mechanical designs as the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1502685/keychron-q1-pro-keyboard-review.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Keychron Q1</a>, and the Logi Options+ software offers limited programmability. Legends that work for both Windows and Mac round out the feature set.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-does-the-logitech-pop-keys-cut-costs\">How does the Logitech Pop Keys cut costs? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At $100 retail, the Pop Keys is technically Logitech&rsquo;s least expensive mechanical keyboard. It&rsquo;s 50 bucks less expensive than the svelte <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/812395/logitech-mx-mechanical-keyboard-review-2.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">MX Mechanical Mini</a>, with the same number of keys, and $30 less than the gaming-focused G613. But spend a little time with the board, and you&rsquo;ll see where Logitech is cutting a few corners for this consumer-focused board. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Logitech Pop Keys brown switches\" class=\"wp-image-1677570\" height=\"676\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/DSC00309.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>First, the typing experience is, for lack of a more appropriate word, cheap. The shiny plastic keycaps are functional, and I got used to their circular shape after only a day or so. But the plastic is slippery, the legends are painted on (and will wear out much faster than doubleshot keycaps), and the switches are just about the cheapest you can find. Every keystroke on this board will rattle far more than even a basic mechanical board with a less splashy design. I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it for a crowded office. Sure, you could swap out the funky keycaps, because the TTC switches use the standard cross stem. But then what&rsquo;s the point of buying this board? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elsewhere, the keyboard is lacking illumination except for the Caps Lock and device indicators, and it offers neither a rechargeable battery or a USB port backup&mdash;I hope you&rsquo;ve got a few AAAs for when this thing dies. Lastly, while I actually like the smooth, rounded body and the stylish little bar on the back, there are no deployable feet, so you&rsquo;ll have to make do with the board&rsquo;s single rather shallow typing angle. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Logitech Pop Keys bottom\" class=\"wp-image-1677572\" height=\"676\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/DSC00412.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption>No hinged keyboard feet means the Pop Keys offers only one typing angle.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>True, Logitech is hardly aiming for the keyboard purist with this design. But even so, omitting such basic features as deployable feet is something I just can&rsquo;t overlook on a $100 board. </p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget is-half-width\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"mentioned-in-this-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\tmentioned in this article\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"mx-mechanical-mini\">MX Mechanical Mini</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"MX Mechanical Mini\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/mx-mechanical-mini-mini-keyboard-top-view-graphite-us.png\" width=\"1600\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review product-widget__review-details\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__rating-and-review-link\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__review-details--rating\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/812395/logitech-mx-mechanical-keyboard-review-2.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__pricing-details  \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/321564/633495/10014?prodsku=6502583&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.bestbuy.com%2Fclick%2F-%2F6502583%2Fpdp&amp;intsrc=CATF_4831&amp;subid1=2-1-1676470-5-814482-10006\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$149.99 at  Best Buy</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-does-the-logitech-pop-keys-do\">What does the Logitech Pop Keys do? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us to the signature functional feature of the Pop Keys, the ability to quickly input emoji. To its credit, the keyboard is very good at this. You can put in any emoji you want, so long as it&rsquo;s supported by Windows or MacOS, and change them out easily enough via the Logi Options+ programming tool. You&rsquo;re not limited to just the emoji included on the board or its spare keycaps, either, though you&rsquo;ll need to remember which ones you chose if you stray from the printed designs. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Logitech Pop Keys emoji alternatives\" class=\"wp-image-1677576\" height=\"676\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/DSC00432.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who prefer their keyboards a little more functional, you can also program the five emoji keys (as well as F4 through F12 and the dedicated Mic key) using the Options+ tool. This allowed me to set up my preferred 75 percent layout, with dedicated volume, start/pause, and screenshot keys on the main layer. It&rsquo;s surprisingly flexible! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Logitech&rsquo;s device-swapping feature is also handled well, as I&rsquo;ve come to expect from the company&rsquo;s wireless designs. Switching between my Windows desktop, iPad, and Android phone was near-instant with the F1 to F3 keys. However, custom emoji programming didn&rsquo;t carry over to the mobile devices. So if you want that effortless emoji input specifically for non-desktop or laptop hardware, you&rsquo;ll be a bit disappointed. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Logi Options+ software \" class=\"wp-image-1677604\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/logi-options-software.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I also have to point out that other Logitech keyboards that can be programmed with Logi Options+, like the MX Mechanical Mini, can <em>also </em>set specific keys to input emoji. But of course, those more buttoned-down boards lack the fanciful emoji keycaps.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget is-half-width is-float-right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"a-better-value-alternative\">\n\t\t\t\t\tA better value alternative\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"keychron-k3-pro\">Keychron K3 Pro</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Keychron K3 Pro\" class=\"product-widget__image\" height=\"634\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/keychron-K3-PRo-hero.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" width=\"1548\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review product-widget__review-details\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Editors' Choice\" class=\"product-widget__review-details--editors-choice-logo\" src=\"https://www.pcworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PC-ED-CHOICE.png\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__rating-and-review-link\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__review-details--rating\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"starRating\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__review-link\" href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1438544/keychron-k3-pro-keyboard-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__information--rrp-value\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__pricing-details  \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--label\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--links-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"product-widget__pricing-details--link\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k3-pro-qmk-via-wireless-custom-mechanical-keyboard&amp;xcust=2-1-1676470-5-1438563-17202&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$94 at  Keychron</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<h2 id=\"is-the-logitech-pop-keys-worth-it\">Is the Logitech Pop Keys worth it?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you scraped off the Logitech branding and replaced the whimsical keycaps with more standard fare, I&rsquo;d say that this keyboard is worth about half its $100 asking price.
