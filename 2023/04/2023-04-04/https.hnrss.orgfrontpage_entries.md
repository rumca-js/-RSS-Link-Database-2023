## Ask HN: People with direct knowledge of YouTube Algorithm-why the repeats?

<p>I get that YouTube and virtually all social media sites want to maximize clicks. I get that YouTube really doesn't give a rat's ass about what I want in that context: they think it's worth far more to override my preferences and add all kinds of channels to my feed than I want. But if you have direct knowledge of the algorithm, please tell me why I can watch a video to the end, then have it recommended for days, weeks, or months after, even when I have dutifully upvoted or commented. What's in it for YouTube? Just because I liked a video by Kyle Kulinsky or Jordan Peterson in 2022 doesn't mean I'm still dying to watch it in 2023. And if you want to force shit down my throat, why give up valuable screen real estate to videos I already saw?</p>

## Launch HN: GradientJ (YC W23) – Build NLP Applications Faster with LLMs
 - [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35445097](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35445097)

<p>Hey HN, we’re Daniel and Oscar, founders of GradientJ (<a href="https://gradientj.com">https://gradientj.com</a>), a web application that helps teams develop, test, and monitor natural language processing (NLP) applications using large language models (LLMs).<p>Before GradientJ, we’d been building NLP applications for 4 years, using transformer models like BERT. With the advent of LLMs and their zero-shot/few-shot capabilities, we saw the NLP dev cycle get flipped on its head. Rather than having to hire an army of data labelers and data scientists to fine-tune a BERT model for your use case, engineers can now use LLMs, like GPT-4, to build NLP endpoints in minutes.<p>As powerful as this is, the problem becomes that without appropriate tools for version control, regression testing, and ongoing maintenance like monitoring and A/B testing, managing these models is a pain. Because the data being evaluated is often fuzzy, developers either have to build complex text processing regex pipelines or manually evaluate each output before a new release. Moreover, if your prompts are only maintained in a notion doc or google sheet, completely separate from these tests, it’s difficult to identify what the changes were that led to underperformance. The workflow often devolves into manual and subjective human data labeling just to decide if new versions of your model are “good enough” to deploy.<p>GradientJ is a web application and API to address that. We let you iterate on prompts, automatically regression test them along multiple dimensions, and finally manage them once deployed.<p>You’d think these are pretty straightforward things to build, but we’ve noticed most versions of “LLM management apps” focus on organizing the workflow for these components without dramatically improving on automating them. At the end of the day, you still have to pass your side-by-side prompt comparison through the “eye-ball test” which creates processes that are bottlenecked by human time. We think by using the very same technology, NLP, you can dramatically reduce the developer labor required for each of these steps.<p>Here’s how we do it:<p>For prompt iteration, rather than just a text-editor “playground” with some special syntax to delineate variables, we’re trying to use large language models to create a Copilot-like experience for prompt engineering. This means aggregating all the tricks of prompt engineering behind a smart LLM assistant who can suggest ways to restructure your prompt for better output. For example, when someone just wants their output in JSON form, we know where to inject the appropriate text to nudge the model towards generating JSON. When combined with our regression testing API, those prompt suggestions will actually be based on the specific dimensions of prompt underperformance. The idea is that the changes required to make a prompt’s output follow a certain structure are different from the ones you’d make to have the output follow a certain tone.<p>When it comes to testing, even before LLMs, configuring high quality tests for expressive NLP models has historically been hard. To compare anything more complicated than classification labels, most people resort to raw fuzzy string comparisons, or token distribution differences between the output. We’re trying to make automated NLP testing more objective by using LLMs to actually power our regression testing API. We use NLP models to provide comparisons between text outputs along custom dimensions like “structure”, “semantics”, and “tone”. This means before you deploy the latest version of your email generation model, you know where it stands along each of the discrete dimensions you care about. Additionally, this helps prevent your prompt engineering from becoming a game of “whack-a-mole”:overfitting your prompt on the handful of examples you can copy and paste while developing.<p>For deployment, we provide a stable API that always goes to the latest iteration of a prompt you’ve chosen to deploy. This means you can push updates over-the-air without having to change the API code. At the same time, we’re tracking the versions used for inference under the hood. This lets you use that data to further improve your regression tests, experiment with fine-tuning across other providers or open source models, or set up alerts around prompt performance.<p>Each of these pieces of our product can be used in isolation or all together, depending on what the rest of your NLP infrastructure looks like.<p>If you use LLMs and are looking for ways to improve your workflow, or if you need to build NLP applications fast and want to bypass the traditional slow data labeling process, we’d love your feedback!</p>

<p>Have you been doing this for a long time? Do you change your schedule for the weekends?<p>For me its easy for me to avoid eating during the week, much more than controlling my eating habits and eating like an adult... but then weekend comes and it becomes 10X harder, especially if others are eating around me. And then a sunny day comes and you "have" go have some barbecue and beer, an hamburguer at night, etc.</p>

## Launch HN: Type (YC W23) – AI-powered document editor

<p>Hi HN, we're Stew and Stefan from Type (<a href="https://type.ai/">https://type.ai/</a>). We're building an AI-first document editor that helps you write. It's similar to Notion, but focused on building a solid authoring experience.<p>Here’s a general demo: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpK9PWo0lUw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpK9PWo0lUw</a><p>And here’s a demo that includes math and code blocks: <a href="https://type.ai/code-math-demos">https://type.ai/code-math-demos</a><p>There are a lot of AI writing products out now, but we've found that most of them treat writing like a one-shot activity that should be delegated to AI. We don't think that's the optimal way to write. We think of great writing as the product of clear thinking, which requires a lot of time tinkering with and refining ideas. So we’re building a user-friendly document editor that puts the author front and center.<p>As you write in Type, you can press cmd+k to summon simple AI commands. Most of our commands are grounded in familiar writing primitives (ex. “Write paragraph”) and attempt to understand the context of your document.<p>Type supports multiple rich block types, including code and math and our commands are able to both interpret and output these block types. So if you're writing an introductory essay about machine learning, for example, you can use Type's chat feature to generate and refine equations and code blocks you'd like to include in your document. Once you’re satisfied with what Type has generated, you can drag and insert the block anywhere in your document (as seen in the demo video above).<p>We’ve also built a "what to write about next" feature in the document sidebar that offers suggestions on ideas you may consider adding to your document.<p>We’ve built some editor features that aren’t AI-specific but which we think make for an enjoyable authoring experience: (1) Type is built from the ground up to be offline-first. This means most interactions (search, loading documents, etc.) are instant; (2) Mobile support as installable PWA; (3) Keyboard shortcuts for the most useful commands; (4) Markdown copy/paste support.<p>We designed Type to be most useful for longer-form writing, so we encourage you to try it out in the context of something like an essay or a technical tutorial. If you try it out at <a href="https://type.ai">https://type.ai</a>, we’d love to hear what you think. We think Type feels pretty different from other AI writing tools that produce fairly shallow content, but would love to get your honest feedback on whether we're hitting the mark.<p>Each account comes with a free allocation of AI commands, after which you can activate a paid plan for unlimited AI usage (you can still create and access unlimited docs on the free plan). If you'd like some additional free credits, please just drop us a note at founders@type.ai and we'll refill your free credits.<p>We'd love your feedback on what feels helpful and what feels confusing or missing. Thanks!</p>

<p>ChatIDE is a sort of a DIY Github copilot X.<p>Launch ChatIDE with a `Cmd + Shift + i`. You bring your own OpenAI api key. You can set the system prompt, temperature, and max tokens in the extension settings.<p>The extension is currently not aware of any of the files in your project, although that might be cool to add later. Use it just like you would use ChatGPT in the browser. Feedback and contributions more than welcome.</p>

## Show HN: Promptr, let GPT operate on your codebase and other useful goodies

<p>Hi HN, 
I've been working on an experimental tool that helps you use GPT to work on your codebase. I'd love to improve the tool if there's interest. New ideas welcome! I think this could also be useful for experimenting with other types of recursive prompts.<p>It’s a little bit Swiss Army knife and a little bit skynet:<p><a href="https://github.com/ferrislucas/promptr">https://github.com/ferrislucas/promptr</a><p>From the README:
Promptr is a CLI tool for operating on your codebase using GPT. Promptr dynamically includes one or more files into your GPT prompts, and it can optionally parse and apply the changes that GPT suggests to your codebase. Several prompt templates are included for various purposes, and users can create their own templates.</p>

<p>I am mainly familiar with AWS but the configuration of S3, lambdas (including creating layers for python dependencies), api gateway, cloudfront, and all of the obscure permissions are just a major pain in the butt. I spent maybe 5 hours building something in Jupyter and then an entire day just dealing with AWS.<p>Is there an easier way? If I gave you a python script and some html what would you use to get it behind a www in the least amount of time possible?</p>
