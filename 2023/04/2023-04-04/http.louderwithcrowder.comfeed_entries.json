I should've known better. </p><p>On Sunday, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/woke-pastor-god\" target=\"_blank\">Pastor</a> Micah Louwagie of St. Mark's Lutheran Church in Fargo, North Dakota, gave a sermon that included an analogy between the Nashville shooting and the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. This past Sunday was Palm Sunday, the beginning of Holy Week and a time to contemplate the agony Jesus Christ experienced during his crucifixion.  </p><p>The clip begins with Louwagie focusing on Jesus:<em> \"They would kill the one whose reputation as a teacher and healer, and whose mission of love and dignity was so very threatening to their own reputation, that they needed to kill him in order to preserve their own good image.\"</em></p><p>Okay, I'm with you...</p><p><em>\"It's baffling to me that someone's existence can be so threatening that people decide they need to be controlled, they need to have laws made against them, or even worse, that the people that they find to be so threatening should die.\" </em></p><p><em><em>\"There are a significant number of people who have deemed the fact that the Nashville shooter happened to be a trans person, so it's been reported, as just the excuse they need to call for the eradication of trans folks.\"</em></em></p><p>Aaaaand there it is. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cI wondered if the mainline response to Nashville would be a little less crazy than usual, but nope, we've already got a tortured analogy linking Jesus' crucifixion to the transgender mass shooter\\u201d</div> \u2014 Woke Preacher Clips (@Woke Preacher Clips)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WokePreacherTV/status/1642956286886305793\">1680546278</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p> I do not know of any conservatives who want to \"eradicate trans people,\" but that seems to be the newest talking point from the opposition. Eradicating the <em>concept</em> of transgenderism is not the same as eradicating a group of people. The former means giving people counseling and help for gender dysphoria instead of cutting off their genitals when they're fifteen years old. The latter would be genocide and unspeakably evil. So yes, there's a difference. </p><p>Not to mention, eradicating the concept of transgenderism serves to uphold the Biblical view of men and woman and affirms that God does not make mistakes. Imagine being a child with gender dysphoria, hearing this all of your life - that God doesn't make mistakes. But then one day, your doctor tells you He actually did, but just with you. And now you need to take hormones and undergo life-changing surgery just to feel okay. How soul-crushing would that be? </p><p>That being said, I do think it's possible to have a charitable view of the actual shooter without excusing her actions. The shooter was clearly suffering. She fell victim to the trans cult. This absolutely does not, IN ANY WAY, excuse her choice to carry out evil. But it can serve as a lesson to us all about the necessity of protecting children from radical gender ideology and trying to help people currently stuck in it. Many of them are deeply hurting and need a way out, not condemnation. Right now, the only path offered to them is \"gender-affirmation,\" which doesn't address the root cause of their gender dysphoria. Therefore, it doesn't work. And only leads to more pain. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Lily is a Zoomer college dropout who somehow landed a writing gig here at LwC.com.

As you can imagine, it was complete chaos. </p><p>One woman Savanah came across was continuously screaming, \"f*ck white people!\" while painted in white paint, donning a blonde wig, with tape over her nipples. She also seemed to be wearing rainbow suspenders. She was on the Trump supporting side of the protest and, according to Savanah, was blocking the entrance sectioned off by police for Trump supporters. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cLive from NYC with the Biden supporting woman who keeps screaming \\u201cf*ck white people\\u201d \\n\\nShe is still blocking the entrance that police have sectioned off for Trump supporters outside of the NYC criminal courthouse:\\u201d</div> \u2014 Savanah Hernandez (@Savanah Hernandez)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sav_says_/status/1643275089696243713\">1680622286</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Upon realizing Savanah was recording, the lady leaned into the camera, screaming again, \"f*ck white people!\" She then proceeded to tell Savanah to \"get her white ass b*tch\" before shoving her, erm, white rear end in the camera. </p>\n<p>Savanah also came across a lady with an \"abort Trump\" sign who had ventured over to the Trump supporting side. When Savanah asked her why she switched sides, she said she wanted to \"spread the love.\" By advocating murder. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cNYC- A woman holding an \\u201cAbort Trump\\u201d sign says she has decided to stand on the pro-Trump side of the protest to \\u201cspread the love\\u201d\\u201d</div> \u2014 Savanah Hernandez (@Savanah Hernandez)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sav_says_/status/1643283130604740609\">1680624203</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Savanah continued to try and interview people about why they believe Trump's indictment is good, and she had a few quality conversations.

She explains they told her to \"get the f*ck out,\" even though she was asking simple, non-leading questions of the anti-Trump protestors. Apparently, dialogue is not allowed in our, ahem, \"democracy.\" </p><p>From these clips, it certainly seems like most of the chaos is coming from the anti-Trump side. Which is weird, since <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/eric-adams-trump-supporters\" target=\"_blank\">Mayor Adams</a> was waaayyy more concerned with pro-Trump hooligans not being able to \"control themselves.\" Not to mention that Marjorie Taylor Greene. Hopefully, the protests remain at this bizarre but largely harmless level, and don't escalate into full-blown violence. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Lily is a Zoomer college dropout who somehow landed a writing gig here at LwC.com.

He asked her why she doesn't have more to say about President Trump's indictment. She tried to explain it away as \"not commenting on ongoing cases.\" But Doocy was relentless. It was impressive, really. </p><p><em>\"But for better or for worse, all that anybody in the country is talking about at this exact moment while we are in here is Trump, and they look here to find out what the White House thinks about it.\" </em></p><p>KJP then hit the same \"not commenting\" line. And I was honestly surprised that Doocy <em>kept going. </em>What a trooper. </p><p><em>\"And so, does the lack of comment mean that you do not think anything happening in New York today is one of the top issues facing the country at the moment?\" </em></p><p>KJP simply said, \"that's your assessment,\" and, you guessed it, declined to comment. As for Doocy's original question, it's a smart angle, but seems highly unlikely. I don't foresee any DA going up against Biden, or Hillary Clinton, or anyone from Obama's gang in the near future - even for very legitimate crimes. </p><p>That's a bone no one wants to pick, since it would mean also going up against the entire DNC establishment, and maybe even some of their globalist pals. Meaning, it's likely <em>not</em> a winnable battle. But we can dream. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Lily is a Zoomer college dropout who somehow landed a writing gig here at LwC.com.

This account appears to be Antifa related, and describes itself as \"OG Defend Equality,\" \"Purveyors of Leftist Merch,\" and \"Chaos Creatures\". Many of their posts have to do with defending LGBTQ rights with guns. </p><p>Provenza actually has a <a href=\"https://archive.is/tSHYm\" target=\"_blank\">second</a> TikTok account apart from her main where she's a tad more controversial in its takes, though it seems to have since been deleted. In one TikTok from last June, Provenza posted the above video featuring a deep-sea creature that seemed to advocate for murdering political opponents. Which is never a good look. </p><p>In another, she suggested she's a witch. Also never a good look. And she offered her fans this bit of advice: \"Don't be the bigger person today. Be the person that helps them understand that sometimes when you f*ck around, you find out.\"</p><p>These are the people in charge of our day-to-day lives. I was pretty shocked to hear this chick hails from Wyoming of all places. And it's unbelievable how little sympathy has been shared for the victims of the shooting.

The past few days, no one has had any idea what the charges against Trump entail. Yahoo news reported last night that Trump will be charged with <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/trump-indictment-37-charges\" target=\"_blank\">34 Class E felony counts</a> for falsification of business records. The info came from a \"source who has been briefed on the procedures for the arraignment of the former president.\"</p><p>The source said a New York City police report will be prepared and entered into court before Trump's arraignment. But, unfortunately, Trump will not be put in handcuffs or get a mug shot. I say unfortunately because, can you imagine the campaign ad that would come out of that? Not to mention the <em>memes</em>? They must know it would be too powerful. </p><p>Falsification of business records can actually be charged as a misdemeanor in New York. But DA Alvin Bragg bumped it up to a Class E felony, asserting that Trump's actions covered up another crime. What that crime was, we still don't know, and we won't until the indictment is unsealed. The charges could result in a prison sentence of up to 4 years, though prison time is not likely for first-time offenders. </p><p>But here's the real kicker. As Greg Price pointed out on Twitter, it's actually a Class E felony to leak a grand jury disclosure. Which is what Yahoo's \"source\" did to give them this information. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cIt was just leaked to Yahoo that Donald Trump is being indicted with 34 Class E felonies.\\n\\nLeaking a grand jury disclosure also happens to be a Class E felony in New York punishable by up to a year in jail.\\u201d</div> \u2014 Greg Price (@Greg Price)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/greg_price11/status/1643082305039224834\">1680576323</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>NYS law states, \"A person is guilty of unlawful jury disclosure when [...] he intentionally discloses to another the nature or substance of any grand jury testimony, or any decision, result, or other matter attending to a grand jury proceeding [...] Unlawful grand jury disclosure is a Class E felony.\"<br /></p><p>Well would ya look at that. The people accusing Trump of committing a crime, committed a crime while reporting on Trump's alleged crime. Classic. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Lily is a Zoomer college dropout who somehow landed a writing gig here at LwC.com.

Commonly referred to as day-drinking or pregaming. I just hope Nick is careful with the open container. This is Alvin Bragg's Manhattan, where <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nyc-subway-suspect\" target=\"_blank\">violent criminals walk free</a> yet you can be <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/nyc-garage-worker-charged-attempted-murder-after-shooting-armed-thief\" target=\"_blank\">charged with murder for shooting someone who shot you first</a>. A white male caught with a Modello could be a double felony: equity and cultural appropriation.</p><p>Plus you want to stay sober for when the 34 charges are ACTUALLY read. No one knows was Trump has been charged with yet. Not that it has stopped <a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/tv/cnn-runs-poll-asking-people-if-they-agree-with-trumps-indictment-without-knowing-whats-in-it/\" target=\"_blank\">CNN and MSNBC from polling people if they agree with the Trump indictment</a> that hasn't been made public. 60% of CNN's audience approves of Trump getting indicted even without knowing why. Go figure.</p><p>While the headlines will read \"34 CHARGES!!!!,\" it's a question of how serious or ridiculous each charge is. <a href=\"https://redstate.com/nick-arama/2023/04/04/those-34-charges-against-trump-may-not-be-what-they-seem-n725992\" target=\"_blank\">Nick Arama from Redstate</a> gives an example:</p><blockquote>So let\u2019s assume for the moment in this alleged \u201cfalsification of business records\u201d charge, that Trump had to file a form that had signatures or initials on the same form multiple times. Each signature/initial could be counted as a potential charge, even if it\u2019s all on the same form and just one incident. So if you had a 34-page form with signatures or initials on each page, you could potentially make 34 charges out of it. We\u2019ll know when we see the real indictment to see precisely what they are talking about. It\u2019s also a bit of flooding of the jury, all they would have to agree to is one to convict. This increases that possibility.</blockquote><p>A good number of the 34 chargers could be every time Trump scribbled \"DJT\" on a document. No one knows, and no one is going to know until 2:00 PM or so today. </p><p>My advice as someone who has dartied hard in his day (I've survived two SantaCons) is to pace yourself. We have the lead-up to the arraignment, the arraignment, and THEN Trump's speech back at Mar-a-Lago tonight. Don't be the guy who is passed out before Trump gets to the courthouse.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.
