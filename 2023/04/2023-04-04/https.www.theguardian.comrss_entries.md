## Rain Dogs review – no wonder Daisy May Cooper is being touted as the next M in Bond

<p>The actor is magnificent in this bleak, beautiful comedy drama – which skewers the grotesque realities of class and sex inequality like nothing else</p><p>Rain Dogs is only eight half-hour episodes long, but it’s a slow burner. My first instinct was to recoil from Cash Carraway’s black comedy as if, to borrow one of many visceral images from it, it were a coffee-colonic induced poo thrown at me. Rain Dogs’ comedy is so black at first it seems to obliterate any possibility of light or warmth. The stark opposite of funny. Despair-inducing, in fact. However, just as I urge you to stick with this nasty, brutish series, please read on.</p><p>We meet Daisy May Cooper’s Costello Jones – sober 99 days – as she’s being evicted from her council flat with her daughter, Iris. Episode one sees her go on a desperate hunt around London to find them a bed for the night. They try to sleep in a launderette. They break into a friend’s car so Iris can attempt her homework. Finally, they take the last available option, inevitably the most dangerous one, and bed down in the cupboard of a pervert (pervert is a word that comes up a lot in Rain Dogs. Also nonce. And whore). He makes Costello put on a pink satin nightie and tells her not to worry because she’s not fat, she’s “just got a food bank body”. She’s rescued by best friend Florian Selby, a filthy rich, entitled, self-annihilating “classical homosexual” with strong Withnail vibes who’s just been released from prison. The half-hour of hijinks ends with them breaking into Costello’s old flat, right back where they started. See what I mean about despair-inducing?</p><p><em>Rain Dogs </em><em>aired on BBC</em><em> One</em><em> and is now available on BBC iPlayer.</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/04/rain-dogs-review-no-wonder-daisy-may-cooper-is-being-touted-as-the-next-m-in-bond">Continue reading...</a>

## Evan Ferguson’s brilliant backheel helps inspired Brighton win at Bournemouth

<p>Evan Ferguson looks destined to play in the Champions League sooner rather than later, but will it be with Brighton? A stunning backheel finish from the 18-year-old Ireland international – his fourth league goal of a memorable first full season – and a late strike from another teenager, the substitute Julio Enciso, enabled Roberto De Zerbi’s side to overcome a spirited Bournemouth effort and move to within striking distance of the top four.</p><p>Just four points now separate Brighton from Tottenham – who have played two more games – and if Ferguson can maintain this kind of form then De Zerbi they can make it a season to remember despite the abrupt departure of Graham Potter to Chelsea in September. For Gary O’Neil, whose side find themselves back in the bottom three after wasting a hatful of chances, it was a harsh lesson from which they must learn quickly.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/04/bournemouth-brighton-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Arguably the biggest change Javi Gracia has implemented since replacing Jesse Marsch at Leeds is the re-introduction of width. Where his American predecessor liked the team to play a narrow game, the Spaniard favours a more expansive approach with wingers no longer penalised for hugging the touchline. Two of his wide boys duly repaid Gracia’s faith here with Jack Harrison and Luis Sinisterra not only scoring the vital goals but torturing Nottingham Forest’s full-backs throughout.</p><p>Their game-changing input enabled Leeds to not only recover after falling behind but rise to the dizzy heights of 13th, albeit just two points above 17th-placed Forest in the tightest of Premier League relegation battles. Only goal difference is keeping Steve Cooper’s side out of the bottom three and, largely due to a woeful away record, his job security looks in increasing jeopardy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/04/leeds-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It was hardly an occasion to rival some of the classic encounters between these bitter rivals, especially with Bruno Saltor doing his best to step into the void left by Graham Potter’s departure, although in the end it was difficult not to conclude that it was not Chelsea’s interim head coach who was having trouble recognising his own team.</p><p>Bruno, more bewildered than anyone that he was chosen to hold the fort until Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali can convince Julian Nagelsmann, Mauricio Pochettino or Luis Enrique to take over, could hold his head up high. Whether the Spaniard is still in charge by the time Chelsea visit Real Madrid next week remains to be seen, but at least his players showed some pride. Was it perfect? No. But Bruno got his tactics right and, while another draw keeps Chelsea in the bottom half, victory would have been theirs if they had anyone capable of putting the ball in the back of the net by legal means.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/04/chelsea-liverpool-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Aston Villa clinched a late win at Leicester courtesy of a sumptuous first-time strike by the substitute Bertrand Traoré to fuel their hopes of playing European football next season. Leicester can only dream of such grand stages after defeat extended their miserable run. Leicester, who sacked Brendan Rodgers last weekend, remain in a sorry predicament, entrenched in the Premier League relegation zone and winless in eight matches. The damning reality is they have taken just four points since winning the reverse fixture at Villa Park at the beginning of February.</p><p>With seconds of three minutes of second-half stoppage time to play, Leicester thought they had won a penalty, only for a VAR review to deem Patson Daka’s bump on Ollie Watkins a foul. Watkins opened the scoring before Harvey Barnes cancelled out his first-half strike. To make matters worse, Leicester will be without Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall for their crucial home match with Bournemouth on Saturday after the midfielder was sent off with 20 minutes to play.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/04/leicester-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Giggling, blushing teens! Unbridled nudity! It’s yet another Anna Richardson show about nakedness, but surprisingly, this one features genuine moments of wisdom</p><p>Channel 4’s long-running but to-this-day terrifying dating show, Naked Attraction, must hold the record for the number of boobs, bellies and balls shown on British television. Its host Anna Richardson has always tried to steer the judging of strangers’ anatomies towards a message of positivity about our endlessly different shapes and sizes, with limited success – and now she has a new series, Naked Education, with which to atone. Again, the hook is unbridled nudity, but this time the focus is definitely on acceptance, myth-busting and affirmative shared experiences.</p><p>We’re in a light-factual magazine format, flipping between clearly labelled sections that recur reassuringly every week. “Teen Talk” gathers together a group of teenagers and asks for their views on a particular aspect of body image, before a gentle re-education takes place at the hands of co-presenters Yinka Bokinni and Dr Alex George. Their unconventional, unforgettable teaching aid? A lineup of fully naked adults.</p><p>Naked Education aired on Channel 4 and is now available on All 4.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/04/naked-education-review-the-look-at-pubic-hair-is-wonderfully-revelatory">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The second film adaptation of the phenomenally successful video game is a disappointment to rival the first</p><p>Films or TV shows based on games don’t have to be terrible – as proved in various ways by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/28/dungeons-dragons-honor-among-thieves-review-passable-playful-adventure">Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honour Among Thieves</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/16/the-last-of-us-review-one-of-the-finest-tv-shows-you-will-see-this-year">The Last of Us</a>.

The trick is usually to make it look as if the game was based on the movie, rather than the other way round. But this much-trailed, much-hyped new animated feature is tedious and flat in all senses, a disappointment to match the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/mar/22/super-mario-bros-movie-killing-fields-chariots-fire-video-game">live-action version in 1993</a>. It’s visually bland in ways that reminded me of European knockoff animations and utterly inert in narrative terms, with a baffling lack of properly funny lines.</p><p>It is of course based on the global video game phenomenon, born in the 80s, from Kyoto-based gaming giant Nintendo, with its wackily eccentric idea of Italian-American plumbers Mario and Luigi. They are called the Super Mario Bros, even though “Mario” is not their surname – like Dostoevsky inventing a videogame called The Brothers Dimitri. This movie revives the ancient and surreal quest undertaken by Mario (voiced by Chris Pratt) and his brother Luigi (Charlie Day), Brooklyn plumbers who only do the silly and borderline-offensive cod Italian voice for their cheesy TV ad.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/04/the-super-mario-bros-movie-review-wackily-eccentric-gamer-guys-fall-flat-on-screen">Continue reading...</a>

Does that still stand?” And this time Woods’ answer was a little different to the one we’ve grown used to. In fact, for the first time in his life, he didn’t really have one.</p><p>Woods very deliberately preferred to concentrate on the second part of the journalist’s question, about how his physical condition compared to this time last year, when he scored 71, 74, 78, 78, and finished in 47th place. “I think my game is better than it was last year at this particular time. I think my endurance is better.

Trump left Trump Tower in a motorcade amid a security lockdown to the court a few blocks away, escorted by the Secret Service. The booking and appearance before Judge Juan Merchan should be relatively brief — though hardly routine — as Trump is fingerprinted, learns the charges against him and may plead, as expected, not guilty. Merchan has ruled that TV cameras will not be allowed in the courtroom.

<p>Labour’s leader has had a dozen slogans since becoming leader, and none have created a buzz about change</p><p>It is <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/highs-lows-keir-starmer-3-years-uk-labour-leader/" title="">three years</a> since Sir Keir Starmer was elected leader of a Labour party despondent after a heavy election defeat. Sir Keir can claim to have come a long way in a short space of time. It is to his credit that Labour is riding high in the polls, with a 20-point lead over the Tories. His purge of party opponents has silenced many of his internal critics and he has ruthlessly excluded potential parliamentary candidates for sometimes “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/apr/04/team-starmer-here-to-win-as-labour-sets-its-sights-on-a-may-2024-election" title="">spurious reasons</a>”. In the battle for hearts and minds, he is right to think that lucky generals are better than good ones. Labour looks set to gain <a href="https://www.lgcplus.com/politics/governance-and-structure/rallings-thrasher-tory-losses-could-top-1000-seats-20-03-2023/" title="">700 seats</a> in May’s local elections, a result that would disrupt the Conservatives’ narrative of an electoral recovery under Rishi Sunak. In Scotland, if the SNP continues to flounder, then its problems could usher in a Labour government.</p><p>And yet Labour is not <a href="https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/keir-starmers-personal-rating-remains-095431307.html" title="">seen</a> as the wave of the future. This is not for want of trying. Sir Keir has repeatedly attempted to capture the mood of the country. He has had 12 <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/fa5b38b4-d18d-11ed-b1cd-5223fe349502?shareToken=606dd2cbca279a1c2934c15a4095d68c" title="">slogans</a> since becoming leader, each one more meaningless than the last. None of Sir Keir’s phrases have so far created public excitement about the idea of change. Instead of building the party to fill a gap in politics and give Labour a distinctive electoral appeal, Sir Keir gambled that the Tories would implode. That bet has not paid off. The Conservative party is getting itself out of the mess it was in at the beginning of the year. The next election could well be fought <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/can-rishi-sunak-s-stock-market-like-government-fix-the-tory-divide-b6lw5h60z" title="">between</a> a candidate whom voters see as competent, smart and rich, and a rival whom voters see as competent, smart and dull. It is still eminently possible that the former could triumph over the latter.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/04/the-guardian-view-on-sir-keir-starmer-his-party-remains-a-mystery-to-voters">Continue reading...</a>

## The Guardian view on obesity: prevention is as important as cure | Editorial

<p>Treatments that allow people to live healthier lives are welcome, but ministers must tackle the causes of this condition</p><p>If an epidemic suddenly began to cause thousands of deaths in Britain, you would expect a swift ministerial response. Between April 2019 and March 2020, more than a million hospital admissions in England <a href="https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/sites/default/files/2021-07/Tackling%20obesity.pdf" title="">were linked to obesity</a>. Because this crisis has crept up slowly, the reaction from government has been weak. Since 1992, ministers have produced <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-0009.12498" title="">14 strategies on obesity, containing 689 policies</a>. All have failed to reduce the prevalence of this condition: <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/health-survey-for-england/2021/overweight-and-obesity-in-adults#:~:text=In%202021%2C%2026%25%20of%20adults,most%20deprived%20areas%20(34%25)." title="">26%</a> of adults and <a href="https://www.ippr.org/files/2020-08/a-whole-society-approach-aug-2020.pdf" title="">34%</a> of secondary school children in England are now obese.</p><p>The current government seems more interested in magic-bullet treatments than prevention. The health secretary, Steve Barclay, recently <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-obesity-treatments-and-technology-to-save-the-nhs-billions" title="">announced</a> funding for “cutting-edge” obesity treatments and technologies, while ministers have since <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/03/08/wegovy-millions-could-receive-popular-celebrity-weight-loss/" title="">praised</a> new obesity jabs <a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/news/article/nice-recommended-weight-loss-drug-to-be-made-available-in-specialist-nhs-services" title="">approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence</a> for those with a body mass index (BMI) over 35. Pharmaceutical companies have been betting on the UK’s increasingly unhealthy population: a recent investigation found that Novo Nordisk, the firm that manufactures the Wegovy slimming jab that will soon be rolled out over pharmacy counters in England, had spent millions on a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/12/revealed-experts-who-praised-new-skinny-jab-received-payments-from-drug-maker" title="">PR campaign</a> before its jab was approved.

<p>After the soft approach of the last three decades it is difficult to be convinced by talk of a new era</p><p>Welcome, then, 34 years after privatisation, to a new era of get-tough regulation in the English water industry. The Environment Agency will have powers to levy unlimited financial penalties on companies for pollution offences. Over at Ofwat, the economic regulator is changing companies’ operating licences so that dividends cannot be paid to shareholders if balance sheets are too flimsy or if environmental performance is too poor. It’s all backed by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/04/therese-coffey-accused-of-throwing-in-the-towel-over-sewage-scandal">the government’s new and wider-ranging “plan for water”</a> that landed on Tuesday.</p><p>Convinced? Well, after three decades of demonstrably soft regulation, the only rational response is to believe in the new era when you see it. That is not only because the government’s headline-grabber about a ban on plastic in wet wipes has been round the policy U-bend twice already, as the campaigner Feargal Sharkey noted.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/apr/04/believe-tougher-water-regulation-england-only-when-see">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Child sexual abuse in the UK is rife and requires multiple solutions. All our home secretary gives us is baseless prejudice</p><p>Child sexual abuse is horrendously common. Recent estimates <a href="https://www.csacentre.org.uk/documents/scale-nature-review-evidence-0621/">suggest</a> that more than one in seven girls and one in 20 boys, or <a href="https://www.csacentre.org.uk/our-research/the-scale-and-nature-of-csa/infographics/">half a million children</a>, are sexually abused in the UK each year. Such abuse happens across all segments of society, in a wide variety of contexts – though most commonly within the home.</p><p>Focus on this issue has led to significant increases in police recording of child sexual offences, <a href="https://www.csacentre.org.uk/documents/child-sexual-abuse-in-2021-22-trends-in-official-data/">reaching</a> more than 100,000 in 2021/22 in England and Wales.

## Chelsea v Liverpool has all the hallmarks of a classic mid-table tussle

<p>Thomas Tuchel is a Big Cup-winning manager, status one might think has currency for a club hoping to win Big Cups – but only because one is not Todd Boehly, whose epochal genius means he sees things that others cannot. So he and only he knew that the smart move was to fire the aforementioned Big Cup-winning manager. How dare that Big Cup-winning manager – any Big Cup-winning manager – refuse to accept the expertise of a chairman whose proudest footballing achievement was discovering its existence in middle-age? So Todd took charge of the situation with all the wisdom of a man going into hospital for brain surgery, then binning off the doctor to operate on himself. Or, to put it another way, exactly the kind of behaviour one might expect from a 49-year-old man with a sweepover fringe and long straggly bits at the back, who thinks that Big Cup-winning managers must bow to the flawless logic of his superior exchequer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/04/chelsea-liverpool-has-all-the-hallmarks-of-a-classic-mid-table-tussle-football-daily">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘It’s my least personal album!’ Thank you, Ellie Goulding, for making pop escapist again

<p>As hyper-gossipy songs by the likes of Miley Cyrus need accompanying guides to help decode them, Goulding’s rejection of ‘personal experiences’ feels radical</p><p>Saying your new album is your “most personal yet” is the oldest pop cliche in the book. It’s an easy – or lazy – way to say that fans should be invested in your next record without telling them why, exactly; a tease that buying a copy of the album will get them ever-so-much-closer to the inside of their favourite star’s head. It’s a line used by the media as much as by stars themselves; a cursory Google of “most personal album yet” will bring up examples ranging from Adele to Stormzy to Post Malone. Sometimes, the descriptor is accurate – I would say that Lana Del Rey’s new album actually <em>is</em> her most personal yet – but often it’s what you deploy when you have nothing else interesting to say.</p><p>That’s why it was so charming when, at a Q&amp;A earlier this week, British pop singer Ellie Goulding went on record to say that her forthcoming album Higher Than Heaven was her “least personal” album ever. “In the best possible way, this album wasn’t taken from personal experiences, and it was such a relief and really refreshing to not be sitting in the studio going through all the things that happened to me and affected me,” she said. “It’s the least personal album, but I think it’s the best album because I got to just explore other things about myself. I just really, really enjoy writing; really enjoy being a singer.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/04/its-my-least-personal-album-thank-you-ellie-goulding-for-making-pop-escapist-again">Continue reading...</a>

## Nina Nastasia review – a mettle-testing, memorable comeback

<p><strong>Komedia, Brighton</strong><br />The American alt-folk singer returns after a 12-year hiatus to worshipful cheers, in a show that condenses her trauma into jagged bursts </p><p>“This new record is a bit of a bitch because it’s not particularly fun to perform,” Nina Nastasia said last year while promoting <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jul/24/nina-nastasia-riderless-horse-review-devastatingly-powerful-songs-of-survival">Riderless Horse</a>, her first album since 2010. That’s the risk an artist takes when they frame a record around a traumatic event. The Hollywood-born alt-folk singer took a 12-year leave of absence due to “unhappiness [and] overwhelming chaos” that culminated in her longterm romantic and musical partner, Kennan Gudjonsson, taking his own life in 2020, the day after she ended their relationship. Riderless Horse, which forms the backbone of this show, condenses her grief into jagged bursts that are as hard to hear as they must be to play.</p><p>A fortifying glass of whisky is at her elbow – “I have a nervous tic, it calms me,” she laughs, perhaps to forestall judgment. But nobody is judging; she commands such reverence that a fan who begins to video the show quickly thinks better of it. It’s something like being at church; this is Nastasia’s first UK tour in a decade, and every moment is taken as a gift. Jokey asides add light to the shade – the one about John Peel’s family making her a Liverpool supporter is a peak American-abroad moment.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/04/nina-nastasia-review-a-mettle-testing-memorable-comeback-komedia-brighton">Continue reading...</a>

## Misogyny is a mighty force on the right – just look at the fate of Finland’s Sanna Marin  | Zoe Williams

<p>As prime minister, she was trusted and liked by voters. Then came allegations that she was a ‘party girl’</p><p>Competent, reasonable, functioning government doesn’t get much spotlight on the world stage, particularly when there are wars and pandemics going on. So when Sanna Marin took office at the end of 2019, it was noted that, at 34, she was Finland’s youngest ever prime minister, and the fourth youngest state leader in the world. But beyond that, she was sorted into the category “progressive, well-intended, needn’t detain us further”. It is a problem for another day that the left is not really interested in its own side, and the right is only interested in the left when it’s in chaos.</p><p>Various elements of her tenure went mainly unremarked, therefore: her Covid response, her announcement that Finland would apply to join Nato in May 2022, her social and fiscal policies that we might broadly classify as “the business of government”. It was only in the summer of last year, when video footage leaked of her at a party, that she became a talking point. Knowing what we know now about the interplay between tabloid and social media – the way agendas are set by traditional news outlets, then amplified wildly by new media’s insatiable quest for outrage – it felt more like a witch-hunt. She took a drugs test in the middle of August, and tested negative. Obviously, the long game wasn’t to lock her up: it was merely to bring her down.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/04/misogyny-finland-sanna-marin">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The beloved sitcom’s scene-stealer may now be hot Hollywood property, starring alongside Jim Carrey and Nicolas Cage, but he refuses to move on from his first love. As he scores a Netflix special and heads for the UK, he explains its allure</p><p></p><p>Plenty of Hollywood stars started out in improv: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/10/amy-poehler-parks-and-rec-is-one-of-those-comedies-people-medicate-with">Amy Poehler</a>, Bill Murray, Mike Myers – they all got noticed on the improv stage then moved on to loftier things. What makes Ben Schwartz different is that, even as his Tinseltown career rockets – he is in Apple TV+’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/28/the-afterparty-review-apple-tv-tiffany-haddish">The Afterparty</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renfield_(film)">forthcoming Nicolas-Cage-as-Dracula movie Renfield</a>, and is the voice of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/28/sonic-the-hedgehog-2-review-no-surprises-in-segas-speedy-critter-sequel">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> – he just won’t leave his much-maligned first love behind. “With the specials and with this tour,” says Schwartz, “the goal is to show that improv is fun, exciting and freeing. That, like standup, it can be done successfully in front of thousands of people.”</p><p>Those Netflix specials, under the banner <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/sep/11/thomas-middleditch-ben-schwartz-funniest-things">Middleditch &amp; Schwartz</a>, are three fantastic long-form improv shows (not sketches, but a whole, hour-long story) performed with his occasional sidekick Thomas Middleditch. It is the streaming platform’s first experiment with live improv. The tour is Ben Schwartz &amp; Friends, which has been circulating North America in the (rare) gaps between the 41-year-old’s acting work, and is coming to London. “I can’t tell you how excited I am to get on that stage in England and do a show,” says Schwartz, his motormouth positivity buzzing across the transatlantic Zoom line.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/apr/04/ben-schwartz-interview-parks-and-recreation-improv-netflix-special">Continue reading...</a>

## What do you, a real person in the real world, want? Best be quiet and let the politicians tell you | Marina Hyde

<p>It’s ever so convenient that at any given moment the thing you care about is never the thing that’s landing them in trouble</p><p>What do “people in the real world” care about? It is a question as old as failing government itself. Yet, crucially, it is something that you – a person, in the real world – are not cleared to answer yourself. Instead, it needs a politician to inform you what you care about – and, much more frequently and much more dismissively, what you don’t care about. Once these permissible areas of giving-a-toss have been delineated, the politicians who told you what they were can get on with the long process of not fixing them, at the end of which they will tell you that those problems are fake/niche/latte-based because, out there in the world where you never go, people aren’t talking about them.</p><p>Let’s see this in action. At the height of Boris Johnson’s Partygate furore, one of his cabinet ministers <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/2022-02-09/claim-that-real-world-people-dont-care-about-no10-parties-is-fanciful">ruled witheringly</a> that none of this stuff was a concern “when you get out into the real world and you talk to real people”. Another high-profile Tory soon joined in the real-worlding, instructing people: “There are many things which matter much more in the real world.” People, so people were told, actually didn’t care about the thing they could be heard appearing to care about on phone-ins, vox pops and across their social media.</p><p>Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/04/real-person-real-world-politicians">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There’s no shortage of suggestions for sweet treats you can make ahead of time, from trifle and mousse to spruced-up carrot cake and macaroons</p><ul><li>Got a culinary dilemma? Email <a href="mailto:feast@theguardian.com">feast@theguardian.com</a></li></ul><p><strong>What’s a good, make-ahead dessert for entertaining over Easter?</strong><br /><em><strong>Chris, Bristol</strong></em><br />“A classic chocolate mousse is unbeatable,” says Gurdeep Loyal, author of the recently published <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/mother-tongue-9780008464547">Mother Tongue</a>. “There’s a restaurant in Paris called <a href="https://www.chezjanou.com/">Chez Janou</a> that’s famous for making a gigantic bowl of chocolate mousse every day, which you basically help yourself to.” What makes this 1960s dinner party favourite such a good tactic, however, is that it can be done well ahead of time and left in the fridge. “Then turn it into chocolate mousse sundaes,” Loyal suggests. “Give everyone loads of bits to adorn it with – crushed amaretti, meringue, almond praline … It’s fun and interactive.”</p><p>The immaculate chocolatiness of a torte also hits the make-ahead sweet spot. Chocolatier <a href="http://www.paulayoung.co.uk/">Paul A Young</a>, author of <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-joy-of-chocolate-9780857839909">The Joy of Chocolate</a>, starts with the base, which is similar to that of a cheesecake. “Crush chocolate chip cookies, mix in melted butter, then press into the bottom of a cake tin.” For the filling you’ll need equal amounts of dark chocolate and double cream: “Melt the chocolate, warm the double cream, then mix the two, spread on to your base, and chill.” You could, Young adds, flavour the filling with cinnamon and nutmeg for hot cross bun vibes or, if it’s adults only, add a splash of brandy or rum. Once set, “top with mini eggs or different-sized Easter eggs – pile them really high”. It will then sit happily in the fridge over the weekend.</p><p>Got a culinary dilemma?

Although overseas viewers will still sometimes be shown different content, it will no longer be via a separate channel.

<p>Spanish manager whose CV also features time at Barcelona and Brighton recently led ATK Mohun Bagan to playoff triumph</p><p>When the 2022-23 Indian Super League (ISL) ended last month, four of the 11 teams had Spanish coaches, four were in English hands and the two countries met in the title decider. Spain triumphed, but more importantly so did ATK Mohun Bagan and Juan Ferrando who, at 42, has brought the title to one of the world’s oldest football cities. Kolkata has clubs that go back to the 19th century, derbies that can attract more than 100,000 and is the spiritual home of the game in India.</p><p>“It is not just a sport, football in Kolkata is part of the family culture, the colours, the feeling,” Ferrando says. “It is something generational and passed from parents to their children over the years. One can’t understand life without it and one must experience it to understand.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/04/juan-ferrando-arsenal-fitness-coach-to-title-winner-in-india-atk-mohun-bagan">Continue reading...</a>

## The Outwaters review – extreme found-footage horror runs amok in the desert

<p>For all its purported mystery and experimentation, Robbie Banfitch’s tale of four unlucky friends out in the wilds comes off as decadent</p><p>We’ve reached the late baroque stage for found-footage horror movies; the signature moves of the genre have become so familiar that directors are reaching for new extremes. Jump scares are even more abrupt, and the gore, often just glimpsed for microseconds, is so horrible it verges on ludicrous. The cinematography is so verité-shaky, the storytelling so eerily elliptical, that you get a film like this – entirely abstract in its last act. Be warned: the end of The Outwaters is mostly just darkness pierced by a wee spot of light from a handheld camera illuminating blood-drenched crime scenes and desert floor all smeared together. It lurches towards a climactic act of self-harm so horrible it’s up there with art history’s worst sufferings of saints.</p><p>Writer-director-cinematographer-editor Robbie Banfitch plays a character named Robbie who wants to make a music video in the Mojave desert starring his friend Michelle (Michelle May), singing the lullaby All the Pretty Horses. The first chunk of the film observes Robbie, Michelle, Robbie’s brother Scott (Scott Schamell) and their friend Angela (Angela Basolis) in Los Angeles as they plan the shoot, visit the men’s mother and party a bit with cocaine and booze before the trip. So far, so ho-hum; it’s all a bit boring and banal, as is the way of found-footage films, which usually don’t want you to like the characters too much before they start killing them off.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/04/the-outwaters-review-found-footage-horror">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I’ve recently become friends with someone at work and have developed feelings for him. I don’t want to make a mistake that will ruin my relationship</p><p><strong>I</strong><strong> have been with my partner for </strong><strong>six years and </strong><strong>married for </strong><strong>three</strong><strong>. </strong><strong>Recently at </strong><strong>work, I’ve become friends with someone who is supportive and sweet</strong><strong> and</strong><strong> I have started to develop feelings for him. He is also in a long-</strong><strong>term relationship but there seems to be flirting on his part, too. It</strong><strong> has got to the point</strong><strong> that I’ve had a few sexual dreams about him. What can I do to</strong><strong> avoid mak</strong><strong>ing a mistake?</strong></p><p>Being married does not insulate one from outside attractions so there are always going to be temptations. Having private fantasies about someone else can be harmless and is no one else’s business, but I am sure that you are already aware of the potential problems that could arise if you choose to act on those fantasies. Eroticism is usually heightened when the object of a person’s desire is forbidden or out of reach and that is why so many people succumb to it. Proximity is not your friend. If you really want to avoid allowing things to develop further, it would be wise to try to socially distance yourself from your workmate. Do not be tempted to respond favourably to his flirtatiousness and do not initiate it yourself. This is undoubtedly a tall order because aside from sexual interest, I suspect you are feeling better about yourself. So it is worth thinking about what may be missing in your primary relationship and how that might have led you to this dilemma. Feeling supported and heard can be a powerful aphrodisiac.</p><p>Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</p><p>If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to <a href="mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com">private.lives@theguardian.com</a> (please don’t send attachments).

<p>I’ve always been proud of my home city. To keep that alive I need to know Manchester’s full history, not its redacted one</p><p>One of my favourite places to visit as a child was Styal country park. We were National Trust kids and every weekend my parents would cart my sister and I off beyond the outskirts of Greater Manchester to reap the benefits of fresh air in our lungs and mud under our fingernails. Styal, with its leafy forests and sun-dappled paths winding over the River Bollin, had a certain magic.</p><p>A key feature of the park was the historic Quarry Bank mill. With red bricks, towering chimneys and functioning water wheel, it is one of the best surviving examples of an early textile mill, and it’s open to the public. I used to love running my hands over the polished wood of the machinery, reading placards about the Industrial Revolution, and marvelling at old pictures of cotton spinning.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/commentisfree/2023/apr/04/black-mancunian-liverpools-slavery-past-manchester">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sheila Francisco is magnificent as a grieving mother and retired screenwriter in this delightfully meta mash-up that pays homage to Filipino action films</p><p>Writer-director Martika Ramirez Escobar’s feature film debut (after making a bunch of shorts) is a total delight. A homage to the pulpy Filipino action films shot on video from the 1970s and 80s, this extremely meta, self-referential comedy-drama-thriller mash-up stars the magnificent Sheila Francisco as not especially well-off housewife Leonor Reyes. Leonor is living with her son Rudy (Bong Cabrera), a middle manager planning to emigrate – but she was once a successful screenwriter, a force to be reckoned with in Manila’s local film industry until a tragic on-set accident took the life of Rudy’s brother Ronwaldo (Anthony Falcon), who as a ghost still haunts his mother’s house, sometimes visibly and sometimes not.</p><p>When Leonor notices there’s a screenwriting competition with a large prize available (the household needs the money given their electricity almost gets cut off), she decides to dust off an old script and revise it with a view to submission. But a bonk on the head from a falling TV set sends her into both a coma and the script itself, which we see acted out like a vintage action movie. In this film within the film, a character named Ronwaldo (Rocky Salumbides) is trying to rescue a pretty damsel in distress (Rea Molina) from an assortment of villains. Leonor becomes a version of herself in the story, an all-knowing matriarchal seer. Meanwhile, Rudy is advised, like the menfolk in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/aug/23/1">Pedro Almodóvar’s Talk to Her</a> (clearly an influence here), to keep talking to his mother in the hope that this will bring her back round to consciousness.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/04/leonor-will-never-die-review-comedy-thriller-in-manila-turns-film-on-its-head-sheila-francisco">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Arline Geronimus was once called the biggest threat to youth in the US. But her theory of how injustice affects our health is more influential than ever</p><p>When Arline Geronimus arrived at Princeton University in the late 1970s to study politics, she entered a world of entitlement and privilege that she never knew existed. The college was “marinaded in testosterone, and upper-class generational Wasp wealth”, she says from her office at the University of Michigan, where she is a professor of health behaviour and education. At Princeton, she was a double minority, a woman and a Jew. Women had only just been allowed and there were complaints about<strong> </strong>a quota of Jews each year (something Princeton denied). That didn’t apply to Geronimus, she tells me with a laugh, because she wasn’t “the good kind” of Jew – the “good kind” being German or western European, not from eastern Europe or Russia like her.</p><p>Her profound sense of being othered at Princeton oriented her towards seeing something that others didn’t see – how people’s experiences of marginalisation affect their health. “I was born about 10 years after world war two,” she says. “The Holocaust was very much in Jewish people’s minds … my parents and grandparents had suffered incredible oppression in Russia and had to become political refugees. I heard horror stories from them about what they went through to establish a life.”</p><p>Weathering: The Extraordinary Stress of an Ordinary Life in an Unjust Society is published by Little, Brown (£25).

<p>Access to doorbells, heaters and watches means that vindictive partners can control and torment wives and girlfriends</p><p>Readers may be familiar with the famous Dolly Parton line “It costs a lot of money to look this cheap”. I like to paraphrase it. If I have a guest at my home, I’ll sweep my hand across the room and say: “Friend, it took a lot of learning to live this dumb.” No, I’m not talking about learning to wear my <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/dec/26/danny-dyer-actor-follow-my-dreams">Danny Dyer T-shirts</a> with pride. I’m talking about my refusal to sign up to smart tech: the internet-connected versions of quotidian household machinery that are becoming commonplace in our modern lives – and increasingly being used by domestic abusers to target their victims.</p><p>Smart technology is nothing new, but its proliferation is. In 2019, <a href="https://www.theecoexperts.co.uk/smart-homes/statistics">57%</a> of homes in Britain had at least one smart device, with people no doubt persuaded by the promise of fully customisable, and even drudgery-free, Jetsons-style residences. Those numbers <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/smart-home/united-kingdom">are rising</a>, with manufacturers seemingly desperate to “smart” anything that can be plugged in (and, of course, charge more for it). There are smart kettles that can be boiled from your phone; smart showers that let you set the temperature digitally; and smart fridges that send you a text to say there is no milk, as if modern life were in short supply of passive-aggressive housemates.</p><p>Coco Khan is commissioning editor for Guardian B2B, and a columnist and feature writer</p><p>In the UK, call the national <a href="https://www.nationaldahelpline.org.uk/">domestic abuse helpline</a> on 0808 2000 247, or visit <a href="https://www.womensaid.org.uk/">Women’s Aid</a>.

<p>Aretha Franklin, Frank Sinatra, Janis Joplin and dozens more sang his songs, which spanned country, rock, R&amp;B and beyond. Now 83 and having treatment for cancer, Taylor explains why he’s still reaching for his guitar</p><p>Chip Taylor is best known for a song of restless raunchiness – the three-chord groin-thrust of the Troggs’ Wild Thing – and one of history’s most epic power ballads in Angel of the Morning, but his songs, he says, come from a much quieter, cooler place. “It comes sort of stream-of-consciousness,” he says, adding that he hears each song in his head “as a listener”. “These words are just coming and I’m having that ‘chill’. There’s a certain stillness that I get through my body. It doesn’t mean it’s going to be successful – but it means if I can get enough of that spirit going, I know that it’s gonna be worthwhile for me. That’s a wonderful blessing.”</p><p>We’re talking on a video call and Taylor, speaking from his Manhattan apartment, apologises for having a hoarse voice from the chemotherapy and radiotherapy for a recently diagnosed throat cancer. His soft-spoken ease and approachability belie his six-decade career as a Hit Man – to poach a title from his mid-90s comeback album. He began as the frontman of a rock’n’roll band, then turned to writing for others during the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/apr/30/when-life-was-brill-review-neil-sedaka">Brill Building</a> era of early pop, soon encompassing rock, R&amp;B and both classic country <em>and</em> outlaw country: icons as varied as Aretha Franklin, Frank Sinatra, Janis Joplin, Willie Nelson and Nina Simone recorded his songs. He has also enjoyed a solo country career with major labels, indies and his own Train Wreck Records, and at 83 is as prolific as ever, with 27 new songs on his latest album, The Cradle of All Living Things.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/04/chip-taylor-interview-songwriter-wild-thing">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Fantastically boring, poorly written and unfunny, this Russian animation could serve as a cinematic naughty step for any parents needing some Easter holiday discipline</p><p>Parents of small children, here’s something to keep up the sleeve over the Easter holidays. If the little ones are behaving badly, use this like a cinematic naughty step – a threat to dangle over them. One more step out of line … and I’ll march you straight to the cinema to watch this. Honestly, this Russian kids’ animation really is a punishment: fantastically boring, charmless, badly written and dubbed into English so flatly that I think a satnav would bring more energy to the characters.</p><p>It’s the second film in the Big Trip franchise, though it really would be cruel and inhuman to sit anyone – let alone a child – in front of more than one. In the earlier instalment, lumpen-looking bear Mic-Mic delivered a baby panda to its parents after a mailing error by the stork. Astonishingly it’s same again this time with the misdelivery of yet another cute little bundle: a baby grizzly bear.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/04/little-bears-big-trip-review-dismal-animation-only-good-for-punishing-kids-with">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Tate Britain, London</strong><br />Dante Gabriel’s paintings are overshadowed by his sister Christina’s poetry in this baffling, overblown exhibition about the decidedly non-revolutionary pre-Raphaelites</p><p>It’s obvious, from the very first room of Tate Britain’s overblown, baffling celebration of the “radical” and “revolutionary” pre-Raphaelites, who was the real talent in the Rossetti family: the poet Christina Rossetti. You can hear readings of her poems here, including Colour, which praises colours in almost childlike, spiritually clear images: “What is yellow? pears are yellow, / Rich and ripe and mellow.”</p><p>Unfortunately as you listen, you are obliged to look at her brother Dante Gabriel Rossetti’s 1849-50 painting The Annunciation, displayed like the icon it isn’t in the middle of the space. Where Christina’s images have a crystalline exactitude that makes them pretty much timeless, this work is strictly for buffs of Victoriana. It is like some sort of taxidermy exhibit, a leaden quotation of medieval art that’s neither properly medieval, nor bitingly modern.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/04/rossettis-review-tate-dante-gabriel-christina">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A devastated Japan, ancient Greece and the Philippines a century ago are among the settings for this month’s picks, while section 28 cannot stop a school romance</p><p>Clara Kumagai’s <strong><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/catfish-rolling-9781803288048">Catfish Rolling</a></strong> (Head of Zeus/Zephyr) is set in the aftermath of the 2011 Japanese earthquake, an event that has left strange pockets of fractured time around the country. Since losing her mother to the devastation, Sora has felt aimless and alone and when her grief-stricken father goes missing, she follows him into uncharted spaces and unknown dangers. An outstanding debut, this is a unique and ambitious story of grief and coming of age, woven around a rich backdrop of Japanese folklore, culture and magical realism.</p><p>Candy Gourlay’s <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/30/young-adults-fiction-round-up-candy-gourlay-nicky-singer-holly-bourne">Bone Talk</a></em> was shortlisted for both the Carnegie medal and the Costa children’s book award. Now she returns to the Philippines of the early 20th century in <strong><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/wild-song-9781788452076">Wild Song</a></strong> (David Fickling Books), a companion novel that can also be read as a standalone. When Luki’s tribe is offered the chance to journey to America for the St Louis World Fair, she eagerly escapes the constraints of rural mountain life. Her overseas adventure brings great wonder, but Luki soon discovers a darker side, of racism and inequality. This is a powerhouse of a novel, rich and immersive, with a fierce and unforgettable narrator.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/04/young-adult-books-roundup-reviews-catfish-rolling-wild-song-lies-we-sing-to-the-sea-boy-like-me">Continue reading...</a>

## Nothing wasted or accidental: how the IPL became the world’s best T20 league | Jonathan Liew

<p>Now starting its 16th season, the IPL has spawned many imitators but none can match the huge crowds and star cricketers</p><p>Fourteen years ago, I took a train from Glasgow to Greenock. Sitting all around me were preschool children on a trip to the seaside, one of whom ended up giving me chickenpox. If you’ve never had chickenpox as an adult, take it from me: you do not want to get chickenpox as an adult. For almost three weeks I was quarantined in bed, pale and sweating, barely enough energy to paw at the lurid purple buboes sprouting across my face and torso. Soon my days would congeal around the single leisure activity still open to me: watching the Indian Premier League on a rickety stream.</p><p>To this day it remains the only IPL season I watched from start to finish. It was only the second staging of the tournament, and even at the time what struck me most of all was how little idea anybody seemed to have about anything: tactics, strategy, squad building, team composition, whether 150 was a good score, whether Jacques Kallis was suited to the format or not. Spin came in two kinds. I don’t recall seeing a single scoop shot or relay catch. Everyone seemed to be grinning. Unknown players with a unique selling point (Kamran Khan, anyone?) could catapult themselves to stardom virtually overnight. It was a fascinating process of watching a sport evolve and falter and think things through in real time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/apr/04/nothing-wasted-or-accidental-how-the-ipl-became-the-worlds-best-t20-league">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The new Hertha Berlin investor, 777 Partners, is one of many groups putting money into multiple clubs worldwide</p><p>“We don’t have a hierarchy of clubs - this is not a pyramid-type model,” Joshua Wander insisted after 777 Partners completed its purchase of a 64.7% majority stake in Hertha Berlin last month. “This is really about preserving the independence and the deep and rich histories of the individual clubs. We want to provide our clubs with the tools so that they can all be the best.”</p><p>It’s been almost five years since the Miami-based private investment firm established by Wander and his partner Steven Pasko in 2015 made its first foray in the world of football by purchasing a minority stake in Spanish club Sevilla. It has since completed full takeovers of Genoa in Italy, Standard Liège in Belgium and Red Star in France, and taken 70% stakes in the Australian club Melbourne Victory and Brazil’s Vasco de Gama.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/04/rise-of-multi-club-ownership-in-football-777-partners-hertha-berlin">Continue reading...</a>

Until then, referendums had always been about the future. But the moment arrived when the horizon closed, and we started to only look back towards the past. A referendum on the past would involve choosing to return to the happiest decade or year from the 20th century in each nation’s history. A deficit of future always unlocks huge reserves of nostalgia for the past: which decade would nations choose? Germany picks the very end of the 80s, a perpetuum mobile of 1989 in which the wall is constantly falling. Italy goes back to the 60s. It’s as if the map of Europe shifts from territorial to temporal, and nations close themselves up – for a very short while – inside their own happy past.</p><p>We are seeing this model – this strong pull backwards – being played out now. In short, time has replaced space. The world has been parcelled out, more or less explored and familiar. We are left with an immense ocean of time, which is really an ocean of the past.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2023/apr/04/putin-war-end-40s-soviet-era">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Shot mostly on her mobile phone, Lisa Selby documents her troubled childhood and her partner’s journey from heroin to recovery in this moving memoir</p><p>When Lisa Selby was 10 months old, her mother Helen dropped her off at the babysitter’s and never came back. In this frank, intimate and incredibly moving documentary, we watch Selby interviewing her mum, a heroin addict and alcoholic, dying of cancer. In her filthy basement flat in south London, cans of Special Brew on the table, Helen answers her daughter’s questions. Are you maternal? “No! I’m terrible! I’m not a responsible parent.”</p><p>As a child, Selby idolised her beautiful, glamorous absent mother. Twice a year, on birthdays and Christmas, cards arrived with Helen’s “autograph”; “she was better than Madonna to me,” says Selby. In a beautifully written voiceover she speaks with painful honesty about the feeling of longing she’s never been able to shake off. She wonders if she can be a mother herself, or if it would be better to break the cycle. “Mum: the word that doesn’t feel good. It’s not my word.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/04/blue-bag-life-review-a-life-touched-by-addiction-lisa-selby-rebecca-lloyd-evans">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Cross-currents of denialism, boosterism, broken governance systems and deep-seated racism will meet with rapidly accelerating sea level rise</p><p>Predictions about how much water is coming vary greatly. Some scientists say we should be planning on three feet of rise by 2050, six feet by 2070 and 10 feet by 2100. Someday, not too long from now, the stories of many current coastal and riverside cities across the US will include sudden plot twists as well as new beginnings, as edges that had seemed solid liquify and become indistinguishable from the seas around them.</p><p>That brings us to Charleston, South Carolina. Its geography is that of a small New York City. The city also has a history of racial immorality, often ignored by its contemporary boosters.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/04/charleston-south-carolina-racist-mistakes-rising-sea-levels">Continue reading...</a>

While our horizons have drawn in, travel writers have continued to reach out, rediscovering and reinterpreting the world for a new age. From 14-16 April, 10 of the UK’s finest travel writers will come to Sherborne in Dorset to transport readers, listeners and both armchair and intrepid travellers alike towards the four corners of the globe.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.sherborneliterarysociety.com/copy-of-sherborne-travel-writing-fest">Sherborne Travel Writing Festival</a> will be the first festival devoted exclusively to travel literature to be held in the UK in recent years.

## A salmon tax: could Norway’s plan show the way to share the benefits of the seas?

## Why do so many romcoms go wrong? It’s down to a problem I call ‘the Minnie Driver’ | Zoe Williams

<p>Romcoms can be fantastic – but the pitfalls are always the same. Will the release of Rye Lane solve the issues once and for all?</p><p>When I was 12, I did Guys and Dolls for a school play. It didn’t leave some massive, psyche-reshaping mark – I don’t fly to it like a homing pigeon every time there’s a production – I just went to the one at the Bridge theatre in London because <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/mar/15/guys-and-dolls-review-bridge-theatre-london-nicholas-hytner">it sounded good</a>. And it <em>is </em>good; it is tremendous. But apparently the work did reshape my psyche after all, if only because I have so much of it stashed in my memory that I came out reeling from the thought of all the things I might be able to do, if I’d managed to displace one stanza of Marry the Man Today. Maybe I’d be able to speak German.</p><p>Look, for 12-year-olds, it was an interesting choice; I was in the chorus, for which a near-perfect song is crafted – Take Back Your Mink – to give an urgent narrative necessity for the chorus girls to strip to their underwear. First they give that rotter back his mink, then his gloves, then his pearls, then all his clothes – the ones they’re wearing. There’s quite a bit of developmental variation at 12 or 13 years old, so half of us looked like burlesque dancers and the other half were basically naked before we started because we had nothing to keep our corsets up. My tits weren’t even the same size; I can still remember <em>which one </em>I flashed at the audience.</p><p>Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/04/why-do-so-many-romcoms-go-wrong-its-down-to-a-problem-i-call-the-minnie-driver">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Compared with the insecurities of her 30s, the broadcaster’s 60s have given her a confidence we could all learn from</p><p>Carol Vorderman is, rather appropriately for a mathematician, currently in her prime. The former Countdown presenter has lately enjoyed an unexpected late renaissance as the kind of fearless public figure she arguably couldn’t have been when she was younger: politically engaged, unembarrassed and trusted to speak up on issues ranging from financial probity in government to menopausal health, with all the authority born of having lived a bit. (Vorderman had severe <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6SHns4bYkM">depression</a> herself in her early 50s, and was audibly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/mar/23/carol-vorderman-disgusted-by-ministers-attitude-to-menopause">incensed</a> when the equalities minister, Kemi Badenoch, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/mar/01/matt-hancock-denies-claims-covid-care-home-testing-advice-uk-politics-pmqs-brexit-live">dismissed calls</a> to outlaw workplace discrimination on the grounds of menopause, comparing the idea to seeking legal protection for having ginger hair.)</p><p>Unlike her fellow broadcaster Gary Lineker, she isn’t politically constrained by working for the BBC. But perhaps more importantly, at the age of 62, Vorderman is evidently experiencing something of a personal liberation. Her two children have grown and gone, and her elderly mother – whom she looked after for years – has died. Twice divorced, the presenter is gloriously unabashed about maintaining a roster of what she calls five <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-11932671/Carol-Vorderman-details-relationships-five-special-friends-works.html">“special friends”</a> with benefits, instead of seeking a partner to settle down with, and has bought a campervan in which to take herself off hiking and paddleboarding at weekends.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/04/carol-vorderman-60s-renaissance-political-hero">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From her shimmering novels to her ‘living autobiographies’, Deborah Levy’s work inspires a devotion few literary authors ever achieve</p><p>Last August, the author Deborah Levy began to sit for her portrait. The starting point was a selfie – eyes penetrating, lips sensuous, head topped by a tower of chestnut hair. The artist, her friend Paul Heber-Percy, used Photoshop, then a pencil and tracing paper, to reverse and multiply the image of her face, until he had a drawing, neatly laid out on a grid, that satisfied him.</p><p>Then it was time to paint. He liked to work in the mornings, in hour-long bursts, in his tiny attic studio. When Levy came for sittings, he’d bring the painting down to the dining room, and the two of them would drink tea or wine, and talk. Not that these were sittings in the traditional sense, but “times I could observe her without feeling self-conscious”, he said.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/04/how-deborah-levy-can-change-your-life">Continue reading...</a>
