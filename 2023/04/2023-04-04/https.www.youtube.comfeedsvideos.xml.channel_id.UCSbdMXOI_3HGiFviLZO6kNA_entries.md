Hello and welcome to TUESDAY NEWSDAY! Your number one resource for the entire weeks worth of VR news! Today we have a GIANT MEGA Newsday with so much stuff packed in it its wild. Sorry I was a little late! Ended up getting really sick at GDC.. but! That's okay! Here we are!

Ended up going back and taking another look at V51 and we gotta talk about it! Also we're gonna talk about AI and VR taking over, PSVR 2 sales not doing so well, Apple getting into VR, Vertigo 2, An HUGE change coming to VRChat, and of course.. the new Vive trackers!

Oh! As well as an entire industry update from Meta's perspective of my time at GDC! 

This is a crazy one! Hope you enjoy!
