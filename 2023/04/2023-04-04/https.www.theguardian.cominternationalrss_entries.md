<p>Ryder Cup veterans made a lucrative commercial call but it should not have been done while still trying to have a slice of DP World Tour cake</p><p>The 2023 version of the Dubai Desert Classic could prove more historic than anybody appreciated at the time. Henrik Stenson, Lee Westwood and Ian Poulter formed part of the field for what may now prove to be the final time on the DP World Tour, formerly the European Tour. Barring successful appeal, news that LIV rebels have seen a sporting arbitration case also involving that tour <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/apr/04/dp-world-tour-wins-landmark-arbitration-case-against-liv-golf-rebels">go against them</a> almost certainly spells the end of the line for a host of iconic European players on their home circuit. A stay on punishment was only that.</p><p>The same Dubai event featured Rory McIlroy embroiled in a tremendous final-round joust with LIV’s Patrick Reed. Reflecting on that, many observers believed the DP World Tour was wrong to challenge the ability of golfers on the breakaway circuit to also play within their own domain. Graeme McDowell stated publicly that the DP World Tour had been afforded “a great opportunity” to allow players to combine schedules.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/apr/04/end-of-line-for-westwood-and-poulter-on-home-circuit-after-liv-rebels-defeat">Continue reading...</a>
