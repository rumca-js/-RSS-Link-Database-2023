Having private fantasies about someone else can be harmless and is no one else\u2019s business, but I am sure that you are already aware of the potential problems that could arise if you choose to act on those fantasies. Eroticism is usually heightened when the object of a person\u2019s desire is forbidden or out of reach and that is why so many people succumb to it. Proximity is not your friend. If you really want to avoid allowing things to develop further, it would be wise to try to socially distance yourself from your workmate. Do not be tempted to respond favourably to his flirtatiousness and do not initiate it yourself. This is undoubtedly a tall order because aside from sexual interest, I suspect you are feeling better about yourself. So it is worth thinking about what may be missing in your primary relationship and how that might have led you to this dilemma.

A homage to the pulpy Filipino action films shot on video from the 1970s and 80s, this extremely meta, self-referential comedy-drama-thriller mash-up stars the magnificent Sheila Francisco as not especially well-off housewife Leonor Reyes. Leonor is living with her son Rudy (Bong Cabrera), a middle manager planning to emigrate \u2013 but she was once a successful screenwriter, a force to be reckoned with in Manila\u2019s local film industry until a tragic on-set accident took the life of Rudy\u2019s brother Ronwaldo (Anthony Falcon), who as a ghost still haunts his mother\u2019s house, sometimes visibly and sometimes not.</p><p>When Leonor notices there\u2019s a screenwriting competition with a large prize available (the household needs the money given their electricity almost gets cut off), she decides to dust off an old script and revise it with a view to submission.

And it <em>is </em>good; it is tremendous. But apparently the work did reshape my psyche after all, if only because I have so much of it stashed in my memory that I came out reeling from the thought of all the things I might be able to do, if I\u2019d managed to displace one stanza of Marry the Man Today. Maybe I\u2019d be able to speak German.</p><p>Look, for 12-year-olds, it was an interesting choice; I was in the chorus, for which a near-perfect song is crafted \u2013 Take Back Your Mink \u2013 to give an urgent narrative necessity for the chorus girls to strip to their underwear. First they give that rotter back his mink, then his gloves, then his pearls, then all his clothes \u2013 the ones they\u2019re wearing. There\u2019s quite a bit of developmental variation at 12 or 13 years old, so half of us looked like burlesque dancers and the other half were basically naked before we started because we had nothing to keep our corsets up.
