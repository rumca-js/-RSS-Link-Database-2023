<p>Mercedes has a very clear plan. Its EQ lineup will continue to grow as it works towards parity with its gas vehicles, and the automaker will eventually transform its consumer cars to those running on electrons. The latest part of that scheme is the EQE SUV, the larger, taller version of the EQE sedan. Both are eco-friendly cousins to the E-Class and both bring what we like (and don’t like) about the EQS to a broader audience.</p><p>Starting at $77,900, the EQE SUV won’t wow you if you’ve been behind the wheel of literally any other Mercedes EV. Instead, the mid-seized luxury EV is a piece of a larger puzzle. That’s not to say that the vehicle doesn’t deliver on the Mercedes-Benz promise of a luxury vehicle. It does this without the buyer having to break the $100,000 mark for an electric SUV.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It has a comfortable cabin, smooth ride, tight but agreeable steering and of course the MBUX infotainment system with in-car voice control that actually works. All three trim levels have ranges above 250 miles and rear-wheel steering is an option that’s definitely worth the money. That said, we’re still not fans of the brakes and to us, the Hyperscreen still feels like a lot of hype although we were able to watch a movie while riding shotgun through Portugal on the passenger screen. For more insight into our first drive of the 2023 Mercedes-Benz EQE SUV, check out the video below.</p><div id="97dc8102e7364a1cb472565d2ed6eba9"></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-eqe-suv-first-drive-big-luxury-in-a-smaller-suv-220134605.html?src=rss

## Tidal's listening party feature is now widely available

<p>After <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tidal-dj-steam-playback-real-time-165544778.html">some testing</a>, Tidal's DJ feature is officially <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230404005659/en/TIDAL-Launches-Live/">available</a>. Now called Live, the option lets HiFi and HiFi Plus subscribers share what they're playing in real-time with other paying members. Once you start, you just have to share links with others who want to tune in. You can't <a href="https://www.engadget.com/technics-sl-1200m7l-annouced-specs-availability-130059818.html">mix and scratch</a>, unfortunately, but this may do the trick if you're hoping to host a virtual listening party.</p><p>As you might guess, Tidal is using this to promote both itself and artists. Musicians like Alesso, Aluna and Diplo are hosting Live sessions in the US, UK, Brazil, Germany and Poland, while Tidal will have genre experts playing picks throughout the week.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Live is available now on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aspiro.tidal&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/tidal-music-hifi-ad-free/id913943275">iOS</a> and works with over 100 million tracks. Tidal plans start at $10 per month. You'll still have to settle for regular AAC tracks, unfortunately. For now, higher quality tunes aren't an option. You also have to listen to DJs in the country where you signed up. You can't tune into a German trendsetter's session from the US, to put it another way.</p><p>This may be more or less alluring than similar options at rival services, depending on what you're looking for. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-remote-listening-party-group-sessions-162131360.html">Spotify's Group Sessions</a> let everyone involve control playback, but only for several people. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-amp-dj-app-140031755.html">Amazon's Amp</a>, meanwhile, is more of a music-oriented radio show tool and (while we were trying it, at least) isn't guaranteed to have the tunes you want to share. Tidal's approach is simple, but may be ideal if you want to be the sole DJ without the pressure to speak up.</p><p>The catch, of course, is that everyone involved has to be a subscriber. Tidal doesn't even register on Statista's global <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/digital-media/digital-music/music-streaming/worldwide#users">market share chart</a> — while it's a known brand, you'll be performing for a relatively small audience. You'll have to convince your friends to switch away from the likes of Spotify or Apple Music to make the most of Live, and there's no guarantee they'll be willing to give up their carefully curated playlists and recommendations.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/tidals-listening-party-feature-is-now-widely-available-205035086.html?src=rss

## Amazon lays off more than 100 employees across its gaming divisions

<p>Amazon's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-will-lay-off-another-9000-employees-in-the-coming-weeks-152653190.html">ongoing layoffs</a> now include those more directly involved in game production. The company has provided an internal memo from gaming VP Christoph Hartmann (originally <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-04/amazon-lays-off-about-100-employees-in-its-gaming-divisions?srnd=technology-vp&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall&amp;sref=10lNAhZ9">shared</a> by <em>Bloomberg</em>) announcing layoffs of &quot;just over&quot; 100 employees across gaming divisions that include Prime Gaming, Game Growth and Amazon Games' San Diego studio. The internet giant is also reassigning workers to projects that fit its &quot;strategic focus,&quot; the executive says.</p><p>The teams in Irvine (which develops the online RPG <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-new-world-now-available-155441505.html"><em>New World</em></a>) and Montreal (on an unannounced project) will continue to grow, Hartmann adds. Amazon's publishing efforts will also expand. Laid off employees are already being notified, and will get severance pay, health benefits and paid time to find new jobs.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company hasn't elaborated on the reasons for the layoffs. In his memo, Hartmann says the cuts come after Amazon weighed its ongoing projects against its &quot;long-term goals.&quot; The company tells Engadget it doesn't have more to share beyond the note.</p><p>Amazon's game development efforts haven't fared well. The company is only offering <em>New World</em> at the moment. Its attempt at a free-to-play shooter, <em>Crucible</em>, was only briefly available to the public and was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-cancels-crucible-003348633.html">shut down after just a few months</a>. There has also been turmoil at the San Diego location. John Smedley, a Sony Online Entertainment veteran who ran Amazon Games' San Diego studio for six years, said in January that he <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-11/amazon-gaming-executive-steps-down-amid-broader-corporate-cuts?leadSource=uverify%20wall&amp;sref=10lNAhZ9">would leave</a> after a transition period.</p><p>The news comes just weeks after Amazon outlined plans to slash 9,000 positions, including some at the livestreaming service Twitch. The tech giant is looking to reduce costs company-wide while dealing with a turbulent global economy and the effects of the pandemic recovery. In that context, the gaming layoffs represent a small piece of a larger strategy.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/amazon-lays-off-more-than-100-employees-across-its-gaming-divisions-190634108.html?src=rss

<p>If the dark, serious tone of Overwatch 2 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/overwatch-2-ramattra-battle-pass-205104977.html">Season 2's Ramattra</a> wasn't your style, the game's latest hero might be a breath of fresh air. Meet <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/23934868/">Lifeweaver</a>, a Thai scientist with long, flowing hair, an elegant sense of style and an overwhelming sense of confidence and bravado. His <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/04/04/overwatch-2-lifeweaver-origin-trailer/">backstory outlines him</a> as a naturalist who wields bio-light technology to "cure diseases and heal the world." In game, that translates to a support class.</p><p>Specifically, Lifeweaver's <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=89f68c82-f255-44fa-8db9-03fec996b93a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YouTube&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4OWY2OGM4Mi1mMjU1LTQ0ZmEtOGRiOS0wM2ZlYzk5NmI5M2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1pdkRBSS1GWE1INCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZGRlZjA3NzItZDNjNy00N2ZhLWE4MTMtYzA2NzU2Y2NlM2VhIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAdyeYKaWQ6tsT00VxJJCuS-k7xVSY7trGmf4s4kiTVXY&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DivDAI-FXMH4">gameplay trailer</a> shows the new hero using plant-themed hard light powers to restore health and using movement powers to turn the tide of battle. We see Lifeweaver pull a knocked back player back onto the map before they can fall off a cliff. Then, the hero creates a platform that lifts the opposing team's Orisa high above the battlefield just as she sets off her ultimate ability, rendering the attack harmless. That ability, Petal Platform, can be used by players on both teams — making it useful both for disrupting enemy movement and offering high ground to allies.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="6b1b54f4147c420aaa7413253937773b"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>Lifeweaver's own ultimate move manifests as a large, glowing tree that constantly heals teammates in the surrounding area. It's also impervious to attacks, meaning it can be used to create cover in open spaces.</p><p>The moveset is certainly compelling — it's easy to imagine using these abilities to help teammates traverse the map in new ways, or help keep the enemy at bay in the final moments of battle. We won't have to wait long to find out exactly how Lifeweaver will change the game, however. The new hero launches with Season 4 on April 11th, and will be free to use for a limited time.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/overwatchs-new-support-hero-lifeweaver-arrives-on-april-11th-184030395.html?src=rss

## Microsoft ground up old CDs to make its new Xbox controller

<p>Microsoft <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/04/04/new-xbox-wireless-controller-remix-special-edition/">announced</a> a new sustainable Xbox controller today. Arriving as an Earth Day promotion, the Xbox Remix Special Edition wireless controller uses recycled materials from old gamepads, auto headlight covers and reclaimed CDs (among other sources) to give each accessory a unique look. Although it offers no special functionality, it allows gamers to vote with their wallets for environmentally friendly manufacturing.</p><p>One-third of each gamepad is made from post-consumer recycled resins and regrind materials. Microsoft says the resins are sourced from materials like “automotive headlight covers, plastic water jugs and CDs.” Meanwhile, the regrind comes from leftover Xbox One controller parts recycled into new material. The company says the regrind maintains the durability and performance you’d expect.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Microsoft describes the combination of recycled resins with regrind as creating “custom, earth-tone colors with subtle variations, swirling, markings, and texturing — giving each Remix Special Edition controller its own look and feel.” Unfortunately, the company’s marketing images don’t appear to reveal much of that, but you can expect each one to look at least slightly different from the rest. It also has “a topographic texture pattern” on its bumpers, triggers and side grip areas, which Microsoft describes as a “nod to the Earth’s dynamic landscape.” Finally, the green hues on its front case, D-pad and Xbox button were inspired by lichen, a composite organism found in the Pacific Northwest.</p><p>It wouldn’t make sense to buy an environmentally sound controller only to stuff it with disposable AA batteries that end up in landfills. So Microsoft bundles an Xbox Rechargeable Battery Pack with each special-edition gamepad. The accessory costs $25 on its own.</p><p>It’s easy to grow cynical about mega-corporations virtue-signaling around Earth Day products that most people won’t buy while their broader product portfolio falls short in environmental friendliness. But hey, it’s still something. Further, Microsoft does point us to its <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5f41950e-8ca3-4481-8466-a22b28b80e32&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Xbox&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI1ZjQxOTUwZS04Y2EzLTQ0ODEtODQ2Ni1hMjJiMjhiODBlMzIiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueGJveC5jb20vZW4tVVMvY29tbXVuaXR5L3N1c3RhaW5hYmlsaXR5IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3YjI2ODczYi0yMDVlLTRjMWMtODVkMy05OTJjNWQwZmUxY2UifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfAvegchQoMYOVK1eBaERDTzZgIBcaOkfMN8mbBjVn0_&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fcommunity%2Fsustainability">Xbox sustainability efforts</a> — including goals of being carbon-negative, water-positive and zero-waste by 2030 and improving its consoles’ Energy Saver sleep mode.</p><p>The Xbox Remix Special Edition controller costs $85, the same price you’d pay for a $60 standard Xbox wireless gamepad with a rechargeable battery pack.

## GM is now the second-largest EV maker in the US

<p>General Motors just pulled ahead of Ford to become the country’s second-leading seller of all-electric vehicles. According to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/04/gm-overtakes-ford-in-us-ev-sales-still-trails-tesla.html"><ins>sales numbers obtained by CNBC</ins></a>, Ford sold just under 11,000 EVs during the first quarter of this year, while GM sold twice that, at nearly 21,000 units.</p><p>As a matter of fact, Ford’s poor showing throughout the past few months dropped it to fifth place in total EV sales in the USA. Hyundai and Volkswagon now make up the third and fourth spots. What is to blame for Ford’s all-electric struggles? It had some significant production downtimes at two North American plants, leading the company to scramble to retrofit a pre-existing plant in Mexico.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Additionally, the Ford F-150 Lighting electric pickup experienced a small recall when some batteries started catching fire, forcing the company to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-will-restart-f-150-lightning-production-on-march-13th-200550043.html"><ins>lose five weeks of production</ins></a>. Ford is planning on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-ev-manufacturing-rate-lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-131424727.html"><ins>using new battery technology</ins></a> to ramp up EV production to 600,000 vehicles a year, but those recent sales figures illustrate just how far it has to go to meet that metric.</p><p>While congratulations are in order for GM, it is worth noting that even it is playing catch-up to market leader Tesla. And it’s not even close. Tesla does not share regional sales reports, but <a href="https://www.motorintelligence.com/"><ins>Motor Intelligence estimates</ins></a> the company sold 161,630 EVs in the United States during the first quarter. That is around eight times the number that GM is currently putting down. According to Tesla, it is on track to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/musks-bold-goal-selling-20-mln-evs-could-cost-tesla-billions-2022-08-30/"><ins>manufacture 20 million electric vehicles per year</ins></a> by 2030, though many experts say the actual number is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-tesla-20-million-car-sales-2030-growth-2023-2">likely to fall much lower than that.</a></p><p>While Tesla is leading the country in sales, the same is not true globally. Chinese manufacturer BYD <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/global-ev-sales-q3-2022/"><ins>sells 20 percent of the world’s EVs</ins></a>, to Tesla’s 12.6 percent. As for GM, the company promises to build 50,000 EVs by the middle of the year and 100,000 more units by the end of the year. One interesting factoid is that the majority of GM’s sales this year were from its budget-friendly Chevrolet Bolt line, which cost under $30,000. The lowest price for a bare-bones Tesla Model 3 is around $43,000.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gm-is-now-the-second-largest-ev-maker-in-the-us-181556063.html?src=rss

## We can build immortal celebrities from ChatGPT and their existing back catalogs

<p>Our reverence towards stars and celebrities was not borne of the 19th century’s cinematic revolution, but rather has been a resilient aspect of our culture for millennia. Ancient tales of immortal gods rising again and again after fatal injury, the veneration and deification of social and political leaders, Madame Tussauds’ wax museums and <a href="https://www.livescience.com/18649-oscar-psychology-celebrity-worship.html">the Academy Awards’ annual <em>In Memoriam</em> segment</a>, they’re are all facets of the human compulsion to put well-known thought leaders, tastemakers and trendsetters up on pedestals. And with a new, startlingly lifelike generation of generative artificial intelligence (gen-AI) at our disposal, today’s celebrities could potentially remain with us <a href="https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/news/photographer-uses-ai-to-imagine-how-dead-famous-people-would-look-today">long after their natural deaths</a>. Like ghosts, but still on TV, touting Bitcoin and Metaverse apps. Probably.</p><h2><strong>Fame is the name of the gam</strong></h2><p>American Historian Daniel Boorstin once quipped, “to be famous is to be well known for being well-known.” With the rise of social media, achieving celebrity is now easier than ever, for better or worse.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“Whereas stars are often associated with a kind of meritocracy,” <a href="https://as.vanderbilt.edu/communication/people/claire-sisco-king/">Dr. Claire Sisco King</a>, Associate Professor of Communication Studies and Chair of the <a href="https://as.vanderbilt.edu/cinema-media-arts/">Cinema and Media Arts program</a> at Vanderbilt. “Celebrity can be acquired through all kinds of means, and of course, the advent of digital media has, in many ways, changed the contours of celebrity because so-called ordinary people can achieve fame in ways that were not accessible to them prior to social media.”</p><p>What’s more, social media provides an unprecedented degree of <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2022/09/ray-j-claims-that-kim-kardashian-was-behind-the-sex-tape.html">access and intimacy</a> between a celebrity and their fans, even at <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=7212db91-cd64-4c1b-ab0d-1d1c998f089e&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=time&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI3MjEyZGI5MS1jZDY0LTRjMWItYWIwZC0xZDFjOTk4ZjA4OWUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly90aW1lLmNvbS80OTE0MzI0L3ByaW5jZXNzLWRpYW5hLWFubml2ZXJzYXJ5LXBhcGFyYXp6aS10YWJsb2lkLW1lZGlhLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDc1ZWU0ZmQtOGZhYy00MzIzLTliYTctNThjMTRmYzA1ZDFlIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAUwQ0Gdm-C5DyvRvDz3ri0sbP0Dv2N7W-XLZvAdpg5JX&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F4914324%2Fprincess-diana-anniversary-paparazzi-tabloid-media%2F">the peak of the paparazzi era</a>. “We develop these imagined intimacies with celebrities and think about them as friends and loved ones,” King continued. “I think that those kinds of relationships illustrate the longing that people have for senses of connectedness and interrelatedness.”</p><p>For as vapid as the modern celebrity existence is portrayed in popular media, famous people have long served important roles in society as trend-setters and cultural guides. During the Victorian era, for example, British folks would wear miniature portraits of Queen Victoria to signal their fealty and her choice to wear a white wedding gown in 1840 is what started  the modern tradition. In the US, that manifests with celebrities as personifications of the American Dream — each and every single one having <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/kristenharris1/hollywood-nepotism-babies-privilege">pulled themselves up by the bootstraps</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/may/15/australian-millionaire-millennials-avocado-toast-house">sworn off avocado toast</a> to achieve greatness, despite their humble beginnings <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-the-warehouse-alessandro-delfanti-pluto-press-163008791.html">presumably in a suburban garage of some sort</a>.</p><p>“The narratives that we return to, “ King said, “can become comforts for making sense of that inevitable part of the human experience: our finiteness.” But what if our cultural heroes didn’t die? At least not entirely? What if, even after Tom Hanks shuffles off this mortal coil, his likeness and personality were digitally preserved in perpetuity? We’re already sending long-dead recording artists like Roy Orbison, Tupac Shakur and Whitney Houston back out on tour as holographic performers. The Large Language Models (LLMs) that power popular chatbots like ChatGPT, Bing Chat, and Bard, are already capable of mimicking the writing styles of whichever authors they’ve been trained on. What’s to stop us from smashing these technologies together into an interactive <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=89f68c82-f255-44fa-8db9-03fec996b93a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YouTube&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4OWY2OGM4Mi1mMjU1LTQ0ZmEtOGRiOS0wM2ZlYzk5NmI5M2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1iMUFJQXl6ZVQ3SSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDc1ZWU0ZmQtOGZhYy00MzIzLTliYTctNThjMTRmYzA1ZDFlIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAe7x5CyI_0kItE3K-DJL5_li7lpwA_8ilgFI1QGpSAv7&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Db1AIAyzeT7I">Tucker-Dolcetto amalgamation</a> of synthesized content? Turns out, not much beyond the threat of a bad news cycle.</p><h2><strong>How to build a 21st century puppet</strong></h2><p>Cheating death has been an aspirational goal of humanity since prehistory. The themes of resurrection, youthful preservation and outright immortality are common tropes throughout our collective imagination — notions that have founded religions, instigated wars, and launched billion dollar beauty and skin care empires. If a society’s elites weren’t mummifying themselves ahead of a glorious afterlife, bits and pieces of their bodies and possessions were collected and revered as holy relics, cultural artifacts to be cherished and treasured as a physical connection to the great figures and deeds of yore.</p><p>Technological advances since the Middle Ages have, thankfully, by and large eliminated the need to carry desiccated bits of your heroes in a coat pocket. Today, fans can connect with their favorite celebrities — whether still alive or long-since passed — through the star’s available catalog of work. For example, you can watch Robin Williams’ movies, stand up specials, <em>Mork and Mindy</em>, and read his books arguably more easily now than  when he was alive. Nobody’s toting scraps of hallowed rainbow suspender when they can rent <em>Jumanji</em> from YouTube on their phone for $2.99. It’s equally true for William Shakespeare, whose collected works you can read on a Kindle as you wait in line at the DMV.</p><p>At this point, it doesn’t really matter how long a beloved celebrity has been gone — so long as sufficiently large archives of their work remain, digital avatars can be constructed in their stead using today’s projection technologies, generative AI systems, and deepfake audio/video. Take the recent fad of deceased singers and entertainers “going back out on tour” as holographic projections of themselves for example.</p><p>The projection systems <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-10-celebrity-holograms-sketch-me-out.html">developed by BASE Hologram and the now-defunct HologramUSA</a>, which made headlines in the middle of the last decade for their spectral representations of famously deceased celebrities, used a well-known projection effect known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper%27s_ghost">Pepper’s Ghost</a>. Developed in the early 19th century by British inventor John Henry Pepper, the image of an off-stage performer is reflected onto a transparent sheet of glass interposed between the stage and audience to produce a translucent, ethereal effect ideal for depicting the untethered spirits that routinely haunted theatrical protagonists at the time.</p><p>Turns out, the technique works just as well with high-definition video feeds and LED light sources as it did with people wiggling in bedsheets by candlelight. The modern equivalent is called the &quot;Musion Eyeliner&quot; and rather than a transparent sheet of glass, it uses a thin metalized film set at a 45 degree angle towards the audience. It’s how the Gorillaz played “live” at the 2006 Grammy Awards and how Tupac posthumously performed at Coachella in 2012, but the technology is limited by the size of the transparent sheet.

A wall of 12 or 15 [projectors] will get you up to 4k resolution.” While the fan arrays need to be enclosed to protect them from the elements and the rest of us from getting whacked by a piece of plastic revolving at a few thousand RPMs, these displays are already finding use in museums and malls, trade shows and industry showcases.</p><div id="bfa4091fada04f41b9df881accc8243b"></div><p>What’s more, these projector systems are rapidly gaining streaming capabilities, allowing them to project live interactions rather than merely pre-recorded messages.

Advances in the field of deepfake audio, more formally known as speech synthesis, and text-to-speech AI, such as <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=0b3db6ab-15b8-465d-9a5c-0905bb162064&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon+Web+Services&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIwYjNkYjZhYi0xNWI4LTQ2NWQtOWE1Yy0wOTA1YmIxNjIwNjQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9hd3MuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9wb2xseS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImQ3NWVlNGZkLThmYWMtNDMyMy05YmE3LTU4YzE0ZmMwNWQxZSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAVvziLwaTjrKHvwxrmBSi8Y7UFzoWuyrfnC9mH4msToa&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fpolly%2F">Amazon Polly</a> or Speech Services by Google, have led to a commercialization of synthesized celebrity voice overs.</p><p>Where once a choice between Morgan Freeman and Darth Vader reading our TomTom directions was considered bleeding-edge cool, today, companies like Speechify offer voice models from Snoop Dogg, Gwyneth Paltrow, and other celebs who (or whose estates) have licensed their voice models for use. Even recording artists who haven’t given express permission for their voices to be used <a href="https://twitter.com/FLOCRAVE/status/1640020711413633028">are finding deep fakes of their work</a> popping up across the internet.</p><p>In Speechify’s case at least, “our celebrity voices are strictly limited to personal consumption and exclusively part of our non-commercial text-to-speech (TTS) reader,” Tyler Weitzman, <a href="https://speechify.com/">Speechify</a> Co-Founder and Head of AI, told Engadget via email. “They're not part of our <a href="https://speechify.com/voiceover-studio/?landing_url=https%3A%2F%2Fspeechify.com%2Fblog%2Fdeepfake-voice%2F">Voice Over Studio</a>. If a customer wants to turn their own voice into a synthetic AI voice for their own use, we're open to conversations.”</p><p>“Text-to-speech is one of the most important technologies in the world to advance humanity,” Weitzman continued. “[It] has the potential to dramatically increase literacy rates, spread human knowledge, and break cultural barriers.”</p><p><a href="https://beta.elevenlabs.io/">ElevenLabs’ Prime Voice AI</a> software similarly can recreate near perfect vocal clones from uploaded voice samples — the entry level Instant Voice Cloning service only requires around a minute of audio but doesn’t utilize actual AI model training (limiting its range of speech) and an enterprise version that can only be accessed after showing proof that the voice they’re cloning is licensed for that specific use. What’s more, “Cloning features are limited to paid accounts so if any content created using ElevenLabs is shared or used in a way that contravenes the law, we can help trace it back to the content creator,” ElevenLabs added.</p><p>The Enterprise-grade service also requires nearly 3 hours of input data to properly train the language model but company reps assure Engadget that, “the results are almost indistinguishable from the original person’s voice.” Surely Steve Van Zandt was onscreen for that long over the course of <em>Lillyhammer’s</em> four-season run.</p><p>Unfortunately, the current need for expansive, preferably high-quality, audio recordings on which to train an AI TTS model severely limits which celebrity personalities we’d be able to bring back. Stars and public figures from the second half of the 20th century would obviously have far more chance of having three hours of tape available for training than, say, Presidents Jefferson or Lincoln. Sure, a user could conceivably reverse engineer a voiceprint from historical records — ElevenLabs Voice Design allows users to generate unique voices with adjustable qualities like age, gender, or accent — and potentially recreate <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=89f68c82-f255-44fa-8db9-03fec996b93a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=YouTube&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI4OWY2OGM4Mi1mMjU1LTQ0ZmEtOGRiOS0wM2ZlYzk5NmI5M2EiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1rUmFZeFlUbEdWTSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZDc1ZWU0ZmQtOGZhYy00MzIzLTliYTctNThjMTRmYzA1ZDFlIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAb_UVA-AI2OyOKyDYPssjOnWwHJwomCJN0GyK4HAJhy6&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DkRaYxYTlGVM">Theodore Roosevelt’s signature squeaky sound</a>, but it’ll never be quite the same as hearing the 26th President himself.</p><p>Providing something for the synthesized voices to say is proving to be a significant challenge — at least providing something historically accurate, as the GPT-3-powered iOS app, Historical Figures Chat has shown. Riding the excitement around ChatGPT, the app was billed as able to impersonate any of 20,000 famous folks from the annals of history. Despite its viral popularity in January, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/01/31/ai-gpt-chatbot-historical-figures/">the app has been criticized by historians</a> for returning numerous factual and characteristic inaccuracies from its figure models. Genocidal Cambodian dictator, Pol Pot, at no point in his reign showed remorse for his nation’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_Fields">Killing Fields</a>, nor did Nazi general and Holocaust architect, Heinrich Himmler, but even gentle prodding was enough to have their digital recreations begin spouting mea culpas.</p><p>“It’s as if all of the ghosts of all of these people have hired the same PR consultants and are parroting the same PR nonsense,” Zane Cooper, a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, remarked to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/01/31/ai-gpt-chatbot-historical-figures/"><em>the Washington Post</em></a>.</p><h2><strong>We can, but should we?</strong></h2><p>Accuracy issues aren’t the only challenges generative AI “ghosts” currently face, as apparently, even death itself will not save us from copyright and trademark litigation. “There's already a lot of issues emerging,” Dan Schwartz, partner and IP trial lawyer at Nixon Peabody, told Engadget. “Especially for things like ChatGPT and generative AI tools, there will be questions regarding ownership of any intellectual property on the resulting output.</p><p>“Whether it's artwork, whether it's a journalistic piece, whether it's a literary piece, whether it is an academic piece, there will be issues over the ownership of what comes out of that,” he continued. “That issue has really yet to be defined and I think we're still a ways away from intellectual property laws fully having an opportunity to address it. I think these technologies have to percolate and develop a little bit and there will be some growing pains before we get to meaningful regulation on them.”</p><p><a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2023-03-16/pdf/2023-05321.pdf">The US Copyright Office in March</a> announced that AI-generated art cannot be copyrighted by the user under US law, equating the act of prompting the computer to produce a desired output with asking a human artist the same. &quot;When an AI technology receives solely a prompt from a human and produces complex written, visual, or musical works in response, the 'traditional elements of authorship' are determined and executed by the technology — not the human user,&quot; the office stated.</p><p>This is the opposite <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2022/08/25/patents-and-ai-inventions-recent-court-rulings-and-broader-policy-questions/">of the stance taken by a Federal Appeals Court</a>. “[Patent law regarding AI] for the most part, is pretty well settled here in the US,” Schwartz said, “that an AI system cannot be an inventor of a new, patentable invention. It's got to be a human, so that will impact how people apply for patents that come out of generative AI tools.”</p><p>Output-based infringement aside, the training methods used by firms like OpenAI and Stability AI, which rely on trawling the public web for data with which to teach their models, have proven problematic as well, having <a href="https://www.engadget.com/getty-images-sues-the-maker-of-ai-art-generator-stable-diffusion-over-data-scraping-allegations-184502897.html">repeatedly caught lawsuits</a> for getting handsy with other people’s licensed artwork. What’s more, generative AI has already shown tremendous capacity and capability in creating illegal content. Deepfake porn ads featuring the synthetic likenesses of Emma Watson and Scarlett Johansson <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/emma-watson-deep-fake-scarlett-johansson-face-swap-app-rcna73624">ran on Facebook for more than two days</a> in March before being flagged and removed, for example.</p><p>Until the wheels of government can turn enough to catch up to these emerging technologies, we’ll have to rely on market forces to keep companies from disrupting the rest of us back into the stone age. So far, such forces have proved quick and efficient. When Google’s new Bard system <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-bard-chatbot-false-information-twitter-ad-165533095.html">immediately (but confidently) fumbled basic facts</a> about the James Webb Space Telescope, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/02/09/1155650909/google-chatbot--error-bard-shares">that little whoopsie-doodle immediately wiped $100 billion</a> off the company’s stock value. The Historical Figures Chat app, similarly, is no longer available for download on the App Store, despite reportedly receiving multiple investment offers in January. It has since been replaced with numerous, similarly-named clone apps.</p><p>“I think what is better for society is to have a system of  liability in place so that people understand what the risks are,” Schwartz argued. “So that if you put something out there that creates racist, homophobic, anti-any protected class, inappropriate content, whoever’s responsible for making that tool available, will likely end up facing the potential of liability. And I think that's going to be pretty well played out over the course of the next year or two.”</p><h2><strong>Celebrity as an American industry</strong></h2><p>While the term “celebrity” has been around since being coined in 17th century France, during the days of John Jacques Rousseau, it was the Americans in the 20th century who first built the concept into a commercial enterprise.</p><p>By the late 1920s, with the advent of Talkies, the auxiliary industry of fandom was already in full swing. “You [had] fan magazines like <em>Motion Picture</em>, <em>Story Magazine</em> or <em>Photoplay</em> that would have pictures of celebrities on the cover, have stories about celebrities behind the scenes, stories about what happened on the film set,” King explained. “So, as the film industry develops alongside this, you start to get Hollywood Studios.” And with Hollywood Studios came the <a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/star-system">star system</a>.</p><p>“Celebrity has always been about manufacturing images, creating stories,” King said. The star system existed in the 1930s and ‘40s and did to young actors and actrices what Crypton Future Media did to Hatsune Miku: it assembled them into products, constructing synthetic personalities for them from the ground up.</p><p>Actors, along with screenwriters, directors and studio executives of the era, would coordinate to craft specific personas for their stars. “You have the ingénue or the bombshell,” King said. “The studios worked really closely with fan magazines, with their own publicity arms and with gossip columnist to tell very calculated stories about who the actors were.” This diverted focus from the film itself and placed it squarely on the constructed, steerable, personas crafted by the studio — another mask for actors to wear, publicly and even after the cameras were turned off.</p><p>“Celebrity has existed for centuries and the way it exists now is not fundamentally different from how it used to be,” King added. “But it has been really amplified, intensified and made more ubiquitous because of changing industry and technological norms that have developed in the 20th and 21st centuries.”</p><h2><strong>Even after Tom Hanks is dead, Tom Hanks Prime will live forever</strong></h2><p>Between the breakneck pace of technological advancement with generative AI (including deepfake audio and video), the promise of future <a href="https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/touchable-3d-holograms-daylight-now-possible-using-superfast-femtosecond-lasers-1508599">“touchable” plasma displays</a> offering <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_light">hard light-style tactile feedback</a> through femtosecond laser bursts, and Silicon Valley’s gleeful disregard towards the negative public costs borne from their “disruptive” ideas, the arrival of immortal digitized celebrities hawking eczema creams and comforting lies during commercial breaks is now far more likely a matter of when, rather than if.</p><p>But what does that mean for celebrities who are still alive?

But that experience never fully lives up.”</p><p>“If you go and visit the Mona Lisa in the Louvre, there's a kind of aura [to the space],” she continued.  “There's something intangible, almost magical about experiencing that work of art in person versus seeing a print of it on a poster or on a museum tote bag or, you know, coffee mug that it loses some of its kind of ineffable quality.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/immortal-hologram-celebrities-chatgpt-ai-deep-fake-back-catalogs-180030493.html?src=rss

<p>Klaus Teuber, who created the board game sensation <em>Settlers of Catan</em>, has passed away at the age of 70. According to the <a href="https://www.catan.com/catan-fans/news/we-mourn-passing-klaus-teuber"><ins>official Catan website</ins></a>, Teuber died on April 1st after a “brief and severe illness.” He is survived by his wife Claudia and their two sons, Guido and Benny, all of which are involved with publisher Catan Studios.</p><p>It is hard to do justice to how important <em>Catan</em> was (and is) to the board game space. Teuber invented the multiplayer resource-trading game in 1995 and is one of the first European board games to achieve massive success throughout the rest of the world. As of 2020, over 32 million copies of <em>Catan</em> in 40 different languages have been sold globally.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="d99b0406310b45fe8e35363b64bf38c9"></div><p>It’s not just board games. The popularity of <em>Catan</em> has allowed for multiple digital versions available for smartphones, video game consoles and PCs. The game has also left quite a pop culture footprint, inspiring countless references in media properties like <em>The Big Bang Theory, Parks and Recreation, Supergirl</em> and <em>South Park</em>. It even inspired a short film in 2014, <em>The Lord of Catan</em>, starring Amy Acker. There have also been rumors of a forthcoming Sony-produced feature film floating around since 2015.</p><p>Teuber may be best known for creating <em>Catan</em>, but the designer also had his hand in many popular board games like <em>Barbarossa, Wacky Wacky Wacky</em> and more. All told, he won the Game of the Year award a whopping four times. Not bad for a former dental technician who didn’t even begin developing games seriously until the 1990s, when he was in his 40s.</p><p>“I developed games to escape,” he told <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2c74dc58-9aed-4251-a9fd-8b3521347943&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+Yorker&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIyYzc0ZGM1OC05YWVkLTQyNTEtYTlmZC04YjM1MjEzNDc5NDMiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3eW9ya2VyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9jdXJyZW5jeS90aGUtbWFuLXdoby1idWlsdC1jYXRhbiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiZWEzMmIzNGQtMmM4MS00ZTlhLTllYTYtMmQzMzgzZmI4YTI0In0&amp;signature=AQAAAXC6-tFuHiK8lPouq9Q2WlYaOvVsI0c-kcqK_BB0t2Ba&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fbusiness%2Fcurrency%2Fthe-man-who-built-catan"><ins>The New Yorker in 2014</ins></a>. “This was my own world I created.”</p><div id="6281eb6d142d42a7911ab7b250c976a1"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">It is with profound sadness that we at CATAN Studio acknowledge the passing of Klaus Teuber, legendary game designer and creator of the beloved board game CATAN.

## Microsoft's Surface Thunderbolt 4 Dock is a high-speed laptop and tablet hub

<p>Microsoft is no stranger to making <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-audio-dock-speaker-140046127.html">elaborate laptop docks</a>, but its latest may be particularly appealing if you need a genuinely robust hub for work. The company has <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/devices/2023/04/04/introducing-the-microsoft-surface-thunderbolt-4-dock/">unveiled</a> a Surface Thunderbolt 4 Dock that, as the name implies, uses speedy Thunderbolt 4 (and hence USB 4) to connect your laptop or tablet to all your  peripherals. There's enough bandwidth to connect two 4K monitors at 60Hz, as well as 96W of power that's enough to recharge some demanding portable PCs.</p><p>The dock offers a healthy mix of modern and legacy ports, plus a few helpful design touches. You'll find two USB-C ports, two USB-A ports, a 3.5mm headphone jack and 2.5Gbps Ethernet on the back, but you'll also find one USB-C and one USB-A port on the front — it shouldn't be awkward to plug in a thumb drive or phone. Tactile indicators on the back make it easier for people of various abilities to find ports by feel, while the 20 percent ocean-bound plastic reduces the environmental impact.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Before you ask: while the dock is designed with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/surface-laptop-5-13-inch-review-specs-price-a-beautiful-design-thats-almost-run-its-course-153049819.html">Surface Laptop 5</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/surface-laptop-studio-review-better-surface-book-130019425.html">Surface Laptop Studio</a> and Intel-based Surface Pro 9 in mind, that's not a strict requirement. Any computer with Thunderbolt 4/USB 4 ports should work. You could attach a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-review-2023-m2-pro-max-140048268.html">MacBook Pro</a>, if you're feeling ironic.&nbsp;</p><p>The Surface Thunderbolt 4 Dock is available today on Microsoft's store <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=67071605-d4df-494e-8d9c-c9c236b8bb38&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Microsoft&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NzA3MTYwNS1kNGRmLTQ5NGUtOGQ5Yy1jOWMyMzZiOGJiMzgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWljcm9zb2Z0LmNvbS9lbi11cy9kL3N1cmZhY2UtdGh1bmRlcmJvbHQlRTIlODQlQTItNC1kb2NrLzhYN0NHSDFOMlRCMiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMjQ2MmFkZTEtMTI5MC00NDEwLTliMjMtNzNhMjE0MzRmNmM1In0&amp;signature=AQAAAR9C6YAp2xghNecpVP9B-iHeZ2rnaLXLL9IeiFx2WoZZ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-thunderbolt%25E2%2584%25A2-4-dock%2F8X7CGH1N2TB2">for $300</a>. That's considerably more expensive than many laptop docks, and you may wish it had features like a full-size SD card reader. The price is on par with similarly powerful docks, though, and it may be worthwhile if you'd rather not spend valuable minutes plugging in peripherals when you sit at your desk.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/microsofts-surface-thunderbolt-4-dock-is-a-high-speed-laptop-and-tablet-hub-161856424.html?src=rss

## PlayStation Store finally adds accessibility tags for PS4 and PS5 games

<p>Sony just made it decidedly easier to find games that accommodate people with disabilities. As of this week, the company is <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/04/03/accessibility-tags-roll-out-this-week-on-playstation-store-on-the-ps5-console/">rolling out</a> accessibility tags on the PlayStation Store for PS5 users. Press the triangle button when looking at game's hub and you'll see whether a title has features to support those with visual, audio and motor needs. You'll know if a game has alternative colors, a screen reader or controller adjustments, for instance.</p><p>The tags will be generally available this week. Most of the initial support revolves around marquee games like <em>Death Stranding Director's Cut</em>, <em>God of War Ragnarök</em> and <em>Spider-Man: Miles Morales</em>. Sony says it's working with a &quot;wide range of developers&quot; to deploy tags going forward, so you can expect to see them from smaller studios.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="df2f8f4657d744e08c43187329d99e2c"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p>The option comes roughly a year and a half after Microsoft <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/10/01/xbox-announces-accessibility-updates/">unveiled</a> similar tags for Xbox gamers. Not that PlayStation developers have been waiting for Sony to act. <em>The Last of Us </em>creator Naughty Dog has made a point of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-last-of-us-part-i-accessibility-options-ps5-dualsense-haptic-feedback-dialogue-184250734.html">prioritizing accessibility in its games</a>, such as a feature that plays dialogue through the PS5's DualSense controller as haptic feedback. In that regard, the store upgrade helps expose and promote these efforts.</p><p>Sony hasn't been standing still. The firm is developing an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-accessibility-controller-project-leonardo-021032382.html">accessible PS5 controller</a> that, like Microsoft's Xbox Adaptive Controller, helps people with limited motor control play games that might otherwise be unusable. The tags are just part of a broader strategy to make gaming viable for many more people — provided they can find a PS5 in the first place, of course.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/playstation-store-finally-adds-accessibility-tags-for-ps4-and-ps5-games-144030448.html?src=rss

## UK privacy watchdog fines TikTok $15.8 million for misusing kids' data

<p>A UK privacy watchdog has fined <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/tiktok/"><ins>TikTok</ins></a> £12.7 million ($15.8 million) for what it says are several breaches of data protection laws, including how the app handled children's personal information. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) <a href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/media-centre/news-and-blogs/2023/04/ico-fines-tiktok-127-million-for-misusing-children-s-data/"><ins>says</ins></a> that, in 2020, TikTok allowed as many as 1.4 million kids aged under 13 to use the app in breach of its own rules.</p><p>The ICO states that companies offering &quot;information society services&quot; to under-13s need to obtain consent from the kids' parents or guardians. TikTok didn't do that, according to the regulator, which noted the company &quot;ought to have been aware that under-13s were using its platform.&quot; Moreover, the ICO (an independent public body) said TikTok didn't do enough to find and remove underage users from the app — despite some senior employees raising concerns about the issue.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The office determined that, between May 2018 and July 2020, TikTok breached the UK General Data Protection Regulation in several ways. Among other things, the ICO says TikTok failed to properly inform users in an easy-to-understand way how it handles and shares their data. As such, TikTok users, including kids, &quot;were unlikely to be able to make informed choices about whether and how to engage&quot; with the app. The office added that TikTok failed to make sure that it was processing the data it held on UK users &quot;lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner.&quot;</p><p>“We invest heavily to help keep under-13s off the platform and our 40,000-strong safety team works around the clock to help keep the platform safe for our community,” TikTok told <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/tiktok-fined-159m-uk-watchdog-misuse-kids-data-98345085"><em><ins>ABC News</ins></em></a>. “We will continue to review the decision and are considering next steps.”</p><p>The fine is not as steep as previously expected. After publishing the preliminary findings of its TikTok investigation, which started in February 2019, the ICO warned the company in September that it faced a fine of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-uk-child-privacy-fine-131538878.html"><ins>as much as £27 million</ins></a> ($33.7 million). The probe started around the time the Federal Trade Commission <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-27-ftc-fines-tiktok-over-child-privacy.html"><ins>fined TikTok $5.7 million</ins></a> over child privacy violations.</p><p>More recently, TikTok has faced deeper scrutiny from regulators around the globe over privacy and security worries. Some governments have raised concerns that the platform's parent company ByteDance (which is based in Beijing) may be compelled to share data on their countries' residents with Chinese officials. Last month, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew <a href="https://www.engadget.com/heres-what-tiktoks-ceo-told-congress-about-the-apps-ties-to-china-and-teen-safety-201657076.html"><ins>told a House committee</ins></a> that &quot;ByteDance is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-ceo-to-congress-bytedance-is-not-an-agent-of-china-173741845.html"><ins>not an agent of China</ins></a> or any other country.&quot;</p><p>Nevertheless, the app has been banned from government devices in several territories, including the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-us-government-ban-devices-omnibus-bill-funding-nasa-234803320.html"><ins>US</ins></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uk-bans-tiktok-from-government-devices-with-immediate-effect-142516712.html"><ins>UK</ins></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canada-is-reportedly-banning-tiktok-from-government-issued-devices-170230648.html"><ins>Canada</ins></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/new-zealand-is-the-latest-country-to-ban-tiktok-from-government-devices-143539571.html"><ins>New Zealand</ins></a>, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/business/australia-tiktok-government-ban-intl-hnk/index.html"><ins>Australia</ins></a>, Norway and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/european-commission-bans-staff-from-using-tiktok-on-work-devices-185157323.html"><ins>European Parliament</ins></a>.

## Hyundai’s Ioniq 6 is a value-packed EV sedan

<p>Hyundai has built itself a reputation for delivering vehicles that offer a luxury feel at regular person prices. The latest EV from the automaker takes that up a notch by not just competing with the Tesla Model 3 but also the more high-end Polestar 2. The 2023 Ioniq 6 starts at $41,600 with two battery and drivetrain options. The various combinations of battery packs and either rear-wheel or all-wheel drive result in range numbers from 240 miles to 361 miles. It gives potential buyers the ability to determine which electric sedan works best for their situation.</p><p>Beyond the range numbers, the vehicle ships with a new and improved version of Hyundai’s driver assistance system, incredibly smooth acceleration mapping and a suspension system that – while not built as a sports sedan – is far more capable than anticipated while hitting the hills above Phoenix, Arizona. The biggest issue with the vehicle is headroom for tall drivers and passengers. The desire to reduce drag has brought the roof down that could be an issue for basketball players.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For more details, check out our first drive video below, where we found the Ioniq 6 to be one of our favorite EVs on the road.</p><div id="e0de24686a7a417fa11fb41647ff03c5"><div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"></div></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/hyundais-ioniq-6-is-a-value-packed-ev-sedan-141507979.html?src=rss

## Samsung Galaxy Watch users can now view their heart rate on Peloton equipment

Once you’ve installed the Peloton app update on your Galaxy Watch, choose a workout on your exercise equipment, open the app on your wearable and follow the “Connect” prompt. You should see your heart rate synced in real-time on your exercise machine. Peloton launched its Wear OS app last October, but it only showed users’ heart rates on the watch, not the workout equipment.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The update arrives as Samsung and Peloton (the latter especially) could use the strategic partnership.

## OnePlus launches $60 Nord Buds 2 with ANC

<p>OnePlus launched a second generation of its budget earbuds today. The Nord Buds 2 cost 50 percent more than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-buds-hands-on-specs-price-availability-143007708.html">last year’s original</a>, but they offer several upgrades in return.</p><p>The Nord Buds 2 still have 12.4mm titanium drivers, but they add active noise cancelation — up to 25dB, according to OnePlus — to help shut out the world around you. Like most ANC earphones, they also offer a transparency mode, and you can quickly switch between the two. Additionally, the company says the Buds 2 use AI (Big Tech’s favorite <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chatgpt-is-suddenly-everywhere-are-we-ready-180031821.html">2023 buzzword</a>) to accentuate bass without losing clarity or adding distortion.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Call clarity was one of our criticisms of the 2022 Nord Buds, and OnePlus claims it addressed that in the new model. The company says “an AI algorithm” pairs with its dual-mic system to amplify your voice, blur background voices and improve call quality. Like their predecessors, the Nord Buds 2 use the AAC codec and support Dolby Atmos, and you can tune their sound with the earbuds’ pre-defined equalizer profiles. In addition, they include IP55 water and dust resistance and have customizable touch controls.</p><figure><img alt="A woman riding as a passenger in a car at nighttime, wearing white Nord Buds 2 earbuds." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/bb19f840-ccbd-11ed-becb-5cb75963c7b4" style="height: 1402; width: 2337;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">OnePlus</div></figure><p>The company says the earbuds' battery will provide up to seven hours per charge and 36 hours total (with ANC off) with its charging-case reserve.

## The best ereaders for 2023

<p>Anyone who stares at a screen all day probably doesn’t want to do so when they unwind with a book. But the convenience of getting a new read instantaneously and carrying a full bookcase in your pocket is pretty appealing. Ereaders combine the best of paper and computers, and they’re capable of storing dozens of books at a time. Amazon dominates in this market, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t worthy competitors. We tested out some of the best ereaders available to help you find which is right for you.</p><h2>What to look for in an ereader</h2><p>Plenty of apps will let you download and read a novel on a phone or tablet. What makes ereaders different is the screen: nearly all of them use technology from a company called E Ink. It manufactures electronic paper displays (EPD) composed of three sheets: one containing millions of microcapsules filled with black and white ink particles sandwiched between transparent electrode layers. When a charge is applied, either the black or white particles shift to the top, forming letters and the whitespace around them.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Because these displays are so different from standard LED panels, you can expect most ereaders to do a number of things well. They’ll be easier to stare at for long periods of time and easier to read in direct sunlight. Also, since E Ink displays only require power to rearrange the ink, these devices have much longer battery lives than standard tablets: we’re talking weeks, not days.</p><p>The ereader market is not as saturated as, say, smartphones, but there are still plenty of options out there and they do have small but important differences among them. They tend to range from around $100 to more than $400, though usually the higher end options are read/write E Ink tablets. Beyond price, you should consider physical properties like buttons, lights, storage and resolution, as well as how the software lets you find and access books.</p><h3><strong>Reading features</strong></h3><p>With any ereader, you’ll navigate the OS via taps and swipes, and some add physical page-turn buttons. Most with built-in buttons have an auto-rotating screen so you can press with your right or left hand.</p><p>As E Ink technology has advanced, resolution has greatly improved – even the budget Kindle has a 300 ppi display. You can still find ereaders with lower resolution, but we don’t recommend them.</p><p>Some ereaders have front LEDs that support light temperature adjustment. That means you can switch to a warmer light after the sun goes down, which will feel easier on the eyes. If you’re concerned about blue light, you should go for a reader with that feature.</p><h3><strong>Other features</strong></h3><p>The capabilities of these pocket libraries have advanced considerably since <a href="https://www.engadget.com/kindle-scribe-update-adds-new-brushes-and-better-organization-210011764.html">the early days</a>. In addition to storing books, some let you browse the web, run apps and play music. The screen’s frame rate can’t handle gaming, but it’s good enough to show you the Wikipedia entry for Constantinople while you read <em>Cloud Cuckoo Land</em>.</p><p>If you listen to audiobooks, you may want an ereader capable of playing them and many current models have that ability. If that’s the case, consider one with a larger storage capacity, since audiobook files can take up more space than standard ebooks.</p><p>Above all, you should consider where and how you intend to find books to read. Most ereaders make it easiest to shop through their own ebook store, but all of them (even <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-kindle-supports-epub-format-002501848.html">Kindles</a>) will now let you download titles from other sources, like libraries, unaffiliated ebook sellers and free public domain sites.</p><figure><img alt="An assortment of ereaders, including ones from Kobo, Kindle, Boox, Nook and PocketBook are arranged on a tan bamboo desk with a white keyboard and black mouse in the background.

It also syncs your reading across devices and apps, so you can pick up where you left off on your phone if you forgot your ereader at home. It truly is the most convenient way to go, but if you don’t want to be locked into one brand’s store, or if you opt for an ereader without its own marketplace, you do have options.</p><h3><strong>How to upload ePubs onto an ereader</strong></h3><p>Stores like <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f51e60ee-4f67-422e-a9c1-0b39bd990155&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=ebooks.com&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJmNTFlNjBlZS00ZjY3LTQyMmUtYTljMS0wYjM5YmQ5OTAxNTUiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZWJvb2tzLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjUxZGNjYmNkLWFjNjUtNGZjMC05OWQzLTZkOWNkMzg5YWNiMSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAZTE_gVdyJQanZZng7czBrFpLG50n2yDvAVP_XbplCsD&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebooks.com%2F">ebooks.com</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/books/">Google Play</a> have millions of ebooks for sale as digital rights-managed (DRM) ePub files, which nearly all current ereaders (including Kindles) can display. Free, public domain classics from sites like <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a> are also packaged as ePubs, but without the added DRM. Books you get from these sources will look just like ones you bought from a proprietary store, thanks to the flowable, formatted nature of ePub files. While these device-agnostic ebook collections give you extra options for finding your next read, they require a few additional steps to get the files onto your ereader.</p><p>To do so, you’ll typically need a computer running a free program called <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=7247b01c-2a32-4141-aac1-4e4bb8170ec0&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Rite+Aid&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI3MjQ3YjAxYy0yYTMyLTQxNDEtYWFjMS00ZTRiYjgxNzBlYzAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWRvYmUuY29tL3NvbHV0aW9ucy9lYm9vay9kaWdpdGFsLWVkaXRpb25zL2Rvd25sb2FkLmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjUxZGNjYmNkLWFjNjUtNGZjMC05OWQzLTZkOWNkMzg5YWNiMSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAYfVa2G0Z86CjcQZkqWy4CaRDfMi0aF2N0kUMd-_t-hK&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adobe.com%2Fsolutions%2Febook%2Fdigital-editions%2Fdownload.html">Adobe Digital Editions</a> (ADE). After buying and downloading the ePub file, open ADE and plug your ereader into your computer. Your device should pop up in the left panel. Drag and drop the ePub file from your downloads folder into the main panel in ADE. The file will display as an image of the book cover. Drag that image onto your device on the left panel. If the file includes digital rights management (which protects against unauthorized copying) you’ll need to authorize your ereader, which requires using or creating a free <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/manage-account/using/create-update-adobe-id.html">Adobe ID</a>. Once you’ve finished adding files to upload, eject the reader from your computer to complete the transfer process.</p><p>Kindle and Boox devices use web-based uploaders instead of the ADE method.

I prefer BooxDrop, which you can find in the App menu of your ereader. It generates a device-specific url which you can type in to access a file delivery portal that uploads directly to your library.</p><h3><strong>How to read library books on an ereader</strong></h3><p>Your local library card lets you borrow audio and ebooks through a program called <a href="https://www.overdrive.com/">Overdrive</a> and its companion app <a href="https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby">Libby</a>. Overdrive recently announced that it will <a href="https://www.engadget.com/e-book-library-app-overdrive-is-shutting-down-on-may-1st-194807737.html">sunset its legacy app</a>, so Libby will be your one and only option if you access library books via Overdrive.</p><p><a href="https://help.kobo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017677053-Borrow-eBooks-from-the-public-library-using-your-Kobo-eReader">Kobo</a> readers have built-in access to Overdrive, and that will not change despite the mobile app’s shutdown. Once you’ve linked your library card, the search function will include results for titles available from your local library; a few taps will upload your selections to your device for the length of the loan.</p><p>To read library books on a <a href="https://help.overdrive.com/en-us/0431.html">Kindle</a>, you can either go through the Libby app or the Overdrive section of your library’s website. Once you click Borrow, you’ll see the option to “Read now with Kindle,” which takes you to Amazon’s site to sign in. After that, the book will be delivered to your device the next time it connects to WiFi.</p><p>For other ereaders, you’ll go through your library’s Overdrive portal and download the ePub after clicking the Borrow button. You can then use the ADE process we described above. Devices that run external apps, like the Boox Leaf 2, allow you to read library books via the Libby app, just as you would on a smartphone or tablet.</p><p>You can also use the Libby app to borrow audiobooks, but you won’t be able to access them through your ereader. (The exception is an ereader, like the Boox Leaf 2, that allows external apps). I found it was easier to listen to an audiobook on my phone anyway, regardless of whether I borrowed it through Libby or bought it from Kindle or Kobo.</p><figure><img alt="Four ereaders are arranged on a dark brown wooden table outside.

We look at what’s available, what’s new, and what shoppers and professional reviewers have to say. Then we narrow a list to the best candidates for hands-on testing.</p><p>I ended up getting eight ereaders, representing five different brands: Amazon, Kobo, Barnes &amp; Noble, Boox and PocketBook. I bought, borrowed and uploaded books for each device using the methods above. Over the course of four weeks I evaluated each one in the areas of book access, ease of reading, extra features and overall value.</p><p>Here’s everything we tested:</p><ul><li><p><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDlTV1c1ODNKP3RoPTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tcjEtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjUxZGNjYmNkLWFjNjUtNGZjMC05OWQzLTZkOWNkMzg5YWNiMSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAcySHeTHhXfCfn5YDuAAM9r06X82QE5iq6RJg6Z8EkPX&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09SWW583J%3Fth%3D1">Amazon Kindle</a></p></li><li><p><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9kcC9CMDhLVFo4MjQ5P3RoPTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tcjEtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjUxZGNjYmNkLWFjNjUtNGZjMC05OWQzLTZkOWNkMzg5YWNiMSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQKdcAdkOl0OnzhUzCgrrExQafnLafVxVH6My9U3SiKJ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08KTZ8249%3Fth%3D1">Amazon Kindle Paperwhite</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://us.kobobooks.com/collections/ereaders/products/kobo-libra-2">Kobo Libra 2</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://us.kobobooks.com/collections/ereaders/products/kobo-clara-2e">Kobo Clara 2E</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://us.kobobooks.com/collections/ereaders/products/kobo-nia">Kobo Nia</a></p></li><li><p><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3cd6c788-8a80-4071-8c9f-0dd43f653aed&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Barnes+%26+Noble&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiIzY2Q2Yzc4OC04YTgwLTQwNzEtOGM5Zi0wZGQ0M2Y2NTNhZWQiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmFybmVzYW5kbm9ibGUuY29tL3cvbm9vay1nbG93bGlnaHQtNC1iYXJuZXMtbm9ibGUvMTE0MDMyNjExMD9lYW49OTc4MDU5NDE0OTI5MyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTFkY2NiY2QtYWM2NS00ZmMwLTk5ZDMtNmQ5Y2QzODlhY2IxIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAfcXlGzx8ysdk1K1dG7T_DhmnEA6PXL-HC5Mh4qKvPv8&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2Fnook-glowlight-4-barnes-noble%2F1140326110%3Fean%3D9780594149293">NOOK GlowLight 4 </a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://shop.boox.com/products/leaf2">Boox Leaf 2</a></p></li><li><p><a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Qb2NrZXRib29rLUdsYXJlLUZyZWUtRXllLUZyaWVuZGx5LVRvdWNoLVNjcmVlbi1UZWNobm9sb2d5L2RwL0IwQjU2VFkzQ1k_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tcjEtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjUxZGNjYmNkLWFjNjUtNGZjMC05OWQzLTZkOWNkMzg5YWNiMSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAejK3RW8C3I2NfcYkoKBOjCWnEl397Ljr2xQyZfOT2Lb&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPocketbook-Glare-Free-Eye-Friendly-Touch-Screen-Technology%2Fdp%2FB0B56TY3CY">PocketBook Era</a></p></li></ul><h2>Best overall: Kobo Clara 2E</h2><p></p><p>During testing, I’d grab the <a href="https://us.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-clara-2e">Kobo Clara 2E</a> when I was off the clock and reading for my own satisfaction. That alone doesn’t make it the best ereader for most people, but the excellent design, performance and interface does. The Clara 2E is helpful from the moment you turn it on. It walks you through setting up an account so you can buy books, then asks about your recent favorite reads to improve its personalized recommendations.</p><p>It also tells you right away about its Overdrive integration that lets you check out ebooks from your library directly on the device. It was refreshing to be pointed towards something free, instead of just showing me more ways to spend money. The borrowing integration is seamless: you can find library books by searching for a title or browsing in the Overdrive tab in the Discover section, where the Kobo store lives.</p><p>The Discover tab and the Kobo store are nicely organized, with top sellers, deals and recommendations based on your history. Title pages are clean and uncluttered, giving you access to synopsis, reviews and preview samples. You can even mark a title as read, to deepen the algorithm's understanding of your preferences. Unlike Amazon’s Kindle store, audiobooks and ebooks are in separate tabs. I would have liked to have them together, and would love it if Kobo did what Amazon does and offer a discount if you buy the audiobook and text version together.</p><p>The customization options on the Clara are just right – there aren’t so many that it’s overwhelming, but you can fine-tune things enough to make the device yours. Features like sleep screens, gesture controls, and headers and footers are all customizable. You can also decide how your library is organized. Navigation is intuitive and I rarely had trouble finding what I was looking for in the settings.</p><p>But what really sets the Clara 2E apart is the reading experience. It’s lightweight and has a textured back for a sure grip, with one rear button controlling sleep, wake and power. The thin bezel makes the device compact enough to cradle in your hand like a smartphone, but is thick enough for your thumb to rest comfortably in a pinch grip.</p><p>On top of that, the front light is lovely. This model gives you both brightness and temperature adjustment, and the quality and subtlety of the glow creates a screen that’s the closest to paper of any ereader I’ve tried. You can also adjust the brightness on the fly by sliding your thumb up or down the left edge of the screen – such a simple feature, but one I used repeatedly. The text is crisp and the ghosting is minor. Text size, font style, line spacing and margins are minutely adjustable and available with a tap as you read.</p><p>Of all the readers, the Clara 2E was the most responsive to my touch. Rarely did it mistake a tap for a swipe or vice versa, and after I learned the controls, I was always brought exactly to where I wanted to go.</p><p>My favorite feature was how fast it woke up. Push the button and you immediately see the page you were last reading. Some ereaders make you push a button, swipe, then wait as the screen flashes and refreshes before finally loading your book. I like to fill spare moments by getting in a page or two, so a speedy wake is key. The page turns are also quick, though in a side-by-side comparison, the Kindle was just a touch faster.</p><p>For $140, the Clara 2E is pricier than other readers with six-inch screens. The standard Kindle is the exact same size and shape, and can be had for as little as $100 if you’re willing to put up with constantly being served ads on your lockscreen. You’ll pay $120 for the luxury of an ad-free model. The Kindle also isn’t waterproof and has no warm light option. In contrast, the Clara has no ads, can handle an accidental dunk in the bathtub and won’t kill your eyes with a ton of blue light. For those reasons – plus every little detail that made reading a joy – I’d recommend Kobo’s device to most.</p><p>Of course, if you’re already invested in Amazon’s ebook space, you may want to go for the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9raW5kbGUtcGFwZXJ3aGl0ZS1TaWduYXR1cmUtRWRpdGlvbi9kcC9CMDhCNDk1MzE5P3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLXIxLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1MWRjY2JjZC1hYzY1LTRmYzAtOTlkMy02ZDljZDM4OWFjYjEifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAf3pz3qUrXZFZtrq3UwxFuxW3R6DpLAqYrhMjjJ-HrIM&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fkindle-paperwhite-Signature-Edition%2Fdp%2FB08B495319">Paperwhite Signature</a>, which our editor Nathan Ingraham endorses in his <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-signature-edition-2021-review-130037090.html">review</a>.</p><h3>Kobo Clara 2E</h3><ul><li><p>Screen size: 6”</p></li><li><p>Resolution: 300dpi</p></li><li><p>Capacity: 16GB</p></li><li><p>Waterproof rating: IPX8 (submergible to 6 feet for 60 minutes)</p></li><li><p>Warm light: Yes</p></li></ul><h2>Best budget option: Kindle</h2><p></p><p>Amazon has dominated in the ereader space for so long that I was surprised when a Kindle device didn’t win me over.

When you buy both iterations of a title, you not only get a discount, but the Whispersync feature lines up where you are in the e-printed version with the narration, too. Say you listen for an hour and then want to read – the synchronization lets you pick up on-screen where you left off audibly. (Though we should point out that you can’t listen and read simultaneously on the same device.) In tests, the feature was fairly accurate, getting me close enough on the page or in the audio to figure out my spot.</p><p>The standard Kindle doesn’t feel particularly luxurious, but it doesn’t feel cheap either. The shell has a velvety finish that doesn’t collect fingerprints, but I found myself wishing it had more texture for a better grip. Navigating from a page to the menu isn’t as speedy as Paperwhite or the Kobos we tried. And it takes a few moments to wake from sleep after hitting the button and swiping.</p><p>Page turns are quick, but the touchscreen gestures didn’t always do what I wanted them to. I’d often find the page skipping forward when I thought I’d tapped to go back. There’s no warm light, which didn’t bother me during the day, but at night it felt like I was still staring at my computer.</p><p>Kindle’s reading customization is great, letting you dial in the font, size and margins. You can even save a set of settings as a “theme,” something not offered by other devices. I created one with larger text and wider line spacing called “tired eyes.”</p><p>Some people won’t be bothered by the lock screen ads that come standard on every Kindle device (unless you pay to remove them). They’re fairly innocuous, mostly promoting Kindle book deals or specific titles (it’s not like you’ll see promos for TVs or robotic pool cleaners). Personally, I like being able to set the sleep screen to the book cover of what I’m currently reading, but it’s easy to get over that if all you want is a more convenient way to consume books at the lowest price.</p><h3>Amazon Kindle</h3><ul><li><p>Screen size: 6”</p></li><li><p>Resolution: 300dpi</p></li><li><p>Capacity: 16GB</p></li><li><p>Waterproof rating: None</p></li><li><p>Warm light: No</p></li></ul><h2>Best reader with buttons: Kobo Libra 2</h2><p></p><p>My first ereader was the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2009-02-26-amazon-kindle-2-review.html">Kindle 2</a> with buttons everywhere, including a full keyboard – that was too many. The <a href="https://us.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-libra-2">Kobo Libra 2</a>, on the other hand, has just two buttons, which is perfect. It has the same streamlined interface as the Clara 2E, including an easy setup and intuitive navigation. You basically get everything that’s great about a Kobo device in a package that looks and feels premium.</p><p>One side of the reader has a wider bezel for the buttons and the screen rotates nearly instantly when you reorient the device, meaning you could have the buttons on the left, right or even bottom. Plus, if you want to lock the orientation when you’ve finally decided on a position, it’s a simple two-tap process. The wider bezel is also slightly thicker and slopes up at the edge, giving it a secure handhold. And I haven’t even mentioned the textured, rubberized back. All together, the Libra is the most comfortable ereader I've ever held.</p><p>At seven inches, the screen is only a little bigger than the standard Kindle or Kobo Clara 2E, but I noticed the difference. Out of all the ereaders I tried, reading the Libra 2 most closely resembles reading a physical paperback, especially after you balance the warm and cool light. But a paperback won’t adjust font size with a pinch or get brighter when you slide a finger along the margin like the Libra 2 will. The text and image clarity is nearly the best of the bunch – only the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9Qb2NrZXRib29rLUdsYXJlLUZyZWUtRXllLUZyaWVuZGx5LVRvdWNoLVNjcmVlbi1UZWNobm9sb2d5L2RwL0IwQjU2VFkzQ1k_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8tcjEtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjUxZGNjYmNkLWFjNjUtNGZjMC05OWQzLTZkOWNkMzg5YWNiMSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAejK3RW8C3I2NfcYkoKBOjCWnEl397Ljr2xQyZfOT2Lb&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPocketbook-Glare-Free-Eye-Friendly-Touch-Screen-Technology%2Fdp%2FB0B56TY3CY">PocketBook Era</a> was crisper. (That device also has a beautiful build. Unfortunately, the software doesn’t yet match the aesthetics.)</p><p>The Libra 2’s larger screen tempted me to use a few of Kobo’s bonus features found in the More section of the main navigation. The web browser is in beta, and it displays simple websites easily, if slowly. The <a href="https://getpocket.com/login?src=web-client">Pocket</a> integration lets you save articles from the web and then read them from the comfort of your Kobo. I used Martha Wells’ Murderbot Diaries as fodder for this testing and one entry is only available as a short story on <em>Wired</em>. I saved the article via the web extension on my laptop, then opened it up on the Kobo. I could then read it like it was any other part of the series.</p><p>At $190, the Libra 2 is one of the more expensive ereaders. But if you’re a voracious reader looking for a luxe experience, you won’t do much better than this.

The tablet runs on a fork of Android 11 and doesn’t hold your hand getting set up. The only books available through the onboard “store” are free public domain classics. However, you can do far more with the Leaf 2 than you can with any standard ereader.</p><p>After enabling Google Play, I searched for and downloaded apps much like on a smartphone or tablet. I even grabbed ereader apps from other manufacturers, including Kobo and Kindle, and installed Libby to read books I had borrowed from the library. Through the built-in Neo web browser, I downloaded Project Gutenberg files, reading them with Boox’s Neo reader. Via BooxDrop, I wirelessly transferred a few ePubs I had on my computer. In short, if there's an ebook you want to read, you can do so on the Leaf 2 in some way.</p><p>The device itself looks similar to Kobo’s Libra 2 with a wider side bezel housing two page turn buttons. Those buttons are programmable, as are most touchscreen gestures. In fact, “customizable” might be the best way to describe the Leaf 2. In addition to a dizzying amount of options built into the operating system, other <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Onyx_Boox/">Boox users</a> have created APK files to tweak and improve your experience.</p><p>The Leaf 2 has a soft, adjustable front light with temperature control and a flush, glare-free screen. The display is as speedy as can be expected with E Ink, and the overall UI is simple enough for anyone familiar with Android to master. The ever-present nav ball is a small, on-screen button that lets you access a few quick functions, and this is the only device we tried with a built-in speaker (yes, it can play Spotify).</p><p>Tech that requires somewhat advanced knowledge often gathers devoted fans, and Boox devices are no different. Get one and you’ll join a club that laughs at proprietary ebook hurdles. You’ll also have tons of possibilities to divert yourself with when you want to do something other than read.</p><h3>Boox Leaf 2</h3><ul><li><p>Screen size: 7”</p></li><li><p>Resolution: 300dpi</p></li><li><p>Capacity: 32GB</p></li><li><p>Waterproof rating: None</p></li><li><p>Warm light: Yes</p></li></ul>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-ereader-130013808.html?src=rss

In a Twitter announcement (via <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-drive-kills-controversial-file-limit/?newsletter_popup=1"><em>Android Police</em></a>), the Google Drive account said it's rolling back a &quot;system update to... item limits&quot; that was made to &quot;preserve stability and optimize performance.&quot; The tech giant said it only ever impacted a small number of users, but it's now exploring alternative approaches to ensure stable performance for all.&nbsp;</p><div id="ad8049434c9c4c048792d3f5bb813a8d"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">If we need to make changes, we will communicate them to users in advance.</p>— Google Drive (@googledrive) <a href="https://twitter.com/googledrive/status/1643049396207009792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 4, 2023</a></blockquote></div><p>Several Drive users have encountered an error showing their upload had failed and that they couldn't exceed a creation limit of 5 million items since February. A Google spokesperson recently confirmed to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/google-drive-does-a-surprise-rollout-of-file-limits-locking-out-some-users/"><em>Ars Technica</em></a> that it had instituted a 5 million file creation cap to &quot;prevent misuse of [its] system in a way that might impact [its] stability and safety.&quot; While Google didn't mention the cap in its new announcement, that's precisely how it described the change it has decided to roll back.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Google caught flak not just for putting a ceiling on how many files a user can make, but also for not warning people about it. The creation cap affected paying users, after all, even those subscribed to the highest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-14-google-one-storage-plans.html">Google One</a> tier that's supposed to provide up to 30TB of storage. It was very much possible to hit the file number cap before reaching that storage limit for those who frequently make or upload smaller files. In addition, Drive doesn't have a counter that could warn users that they're approaching the 5 million file creation cap.</p><p>Bottom line, it wasn't the best approach to prevent Drive misuse, and not telling users about it beforehand was perhaps as bad the limit itself. Google promised in its announcement that if it decides to incorporate changes to the cloud storage service in the future, it will communicate them to users in advance.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/google-removes-5-million-file-creation-cap-for-drive-after-backlash-114501891.html?src=rss

## The Morning After: Twitter keeps legacy verified blue ticks around, for now

<p>Last week, Twitter said it would start winding down the legacy verified program on April 1st, but over the weekend, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-stokes-confusion-as-verified-drama-continues-104321432.html">that didn't happen</a>, because (according to <em>The Washington Post</em>) unverifying users is a painstaking manual process. Meanwhile, another report indicated around 10,000 of the top-followed sites would retain their legacy checkmarks, even if they didn't subscribe to Twitter Blue. And now, Twitter is displaying the same status for both legacy verified and Twitter Blue subscribers, making it difficult to tell them apart. Twitter said Twitter Blue would cost $1,000 per month for organizations, plus an additional $50 per month for individual affiliates in the US.</p><p>At the moment, I still have my blue tick, but I am very ready to bid it farewell.</p><p>– Mat Smith</p><p><em>The Morning After isn’t just a</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/about/newsletter/"><em> newsletter</em></a><em> –  it’s also a daily podcast.

## Motorola's Edge 40 Pro offers 125W fast charging and a 165Hz screen

<p>Now that Lenovo has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-has-shut-down-its-legion-gaming-phone-business-082028564.html">given up</a> on Legion gaming smartphones, it can focus on its primary brand: Motorola. To wit, the company just launched a new flagship that offers some of Legion's gaming cred, the Motorola Edge 40 Pro. Some of the impressive features include a fast 165Hz screen, the latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset and extremely fast charging.&nbsp;</p><p>The Edge 40 uses a screen that curves inward, even at the top, for what Moto calls &quot;unparalleled comfort&quot; — though anyone who's ever owned a curved screen phone knows they tend to slip in your hands. It comes with an anti-fingerprint coating on the front and anti-glare glass inlay on the back, with both sides protected by Corning's Gorilla Glass Victus.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The 6.67-inch FHD+ pOLED display runs at up to a 165Hz refresh rate, making it one of the faster flagship phone displays out there And if it's entertainment you're into, it's also the first Motorola phone with Dolby Vision HDR (and HDR10+) playback, offering a bright and accurate view of HDR movies and games. It also uses Dolby Atmos sound, along with a new feature called Moto Spatial Sound for music, movies and games. It sounds a lot like Apple's spatial audio, offering an immersive surround sound experience.</p><p>For demanding games and tasks, the Edge 40 Pro users Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 mobile platform, along with LPDDR5X RAM and UFS 4.0, the fastest RAM and storage currently available. Meanwhile, the 4,600 mAh battery can be charged at up to 125W, letting you fully juice it in 23 minutes, right up there with the best Android phones.</p><p>Finally, on the camera front, the Edge 40 Pro has a triple high-res camera system with a 50-megapixel (MP) wide camera that features optical image stabilization (OIS) and phase-detect AF for every pixel. The ultrawide camera is also 50-megapixels, and the third camera is a 12MP 2x telephoto. There's a 60MP selfie pinhole camera up front. Video can be captured in 8K30p, 4K HDR10+ at 30fps, and 4K at up to 60fps. Naturally, it features AI tricks like auto smile capture, Google Lens integration, auto night vision and more.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, the Motorola Edge 40 pro will only be available in Europe in the coming days and Latin America a little bit later — there's no sign of US availability so far. It starts at €900 in Europe, a reasonable price for such a high-spec phone.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/motorolas-edge-40-pro-offers-125w-fast-charging-and-a-165hz-screen-110018477.html?src=rss

## Virgin Orbit files for bankruptcy protection as it seeks a buyer

<p>Virgin Orbit has <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d27cc6ab-43af-4694-8678-2f18415537e8">filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy</a> protection a few days after officially <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-orbit-officially-shutters-its-space-launch-operations-231755999.html">shutting down</a> its space launch operations. The private space company has been burning money for a while now and reported a loss of $49.2 million in its last fiscal quarter. It tried to raise money in late 2021 by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-orbit-public-nasdaq-spac-merger-142336346.html">going public</a> through an SPAC merger that was expected to raise $483 million for the company. However, it ultimately <a href="https://spacenews.com/virgin-orbit-raises-far-less-than-expected-from-spac-merger/">got less than half</a> of that amount in gross proceeds.&nbsp;</p><p>While Virgin Orbit carried on throughout 2022, its financial issues came to a head after its &quot;Start Me Up&quot; mission didn't quite go as expected. It was supposed to be a historic event as the first orbital launch from UK soil, but it failed to reach orbit due to a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-orbit-confirms-a-dislodged-fuel-filter-caused-its-first-uk-launch-to-fail-102542775.html">dislodged fuel filter</a>. The company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-orbit-furloughs-most-employees-and-pauses-operations-for-a-week-065542834.html">went into operational pause</a> and furloughed most employees after that, in mid-March, as it sought new investors. And by the end of last month, it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-orbit-extends-employee-furlough-as-it-continues-to-seek-funding-072232194.html">extended its employee furlough</a>, because it wasn't able to close any deals.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Virgin Orbit's late-stage discussions with Texas-based investor Matthew Brown, who was going to put $200 million into the company, reportedly broke down. It was perhaps the perfect deal for the launch provider, since that amount would've been enough to give the investor a controlling stake. A previous report by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/23/investing-in-space-the-virgin-orbit-latecomer-matthew-brown.html"><em>CNBC's Investing in Space</em></a> newsletter said Sir Richard Branson didn't want to own the company anymore, even through the bankruptcy process, and that the Virgin Group had been rushing to find new sources of funding and buyers before the news broke.&nbsp;</p><p>On March 30th, the company officially shuttered its space launch operations due to lack of funding. It flew a total of six flights from 2020, though only four of which were able to put satellites in orbit. According to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d27cc6ab-43af-4694-8678-2f18415537e8"><em>Financial Times</em></a>, Virgin Orbit said it expected to report $33.1 million in revenue and a net loss of around $191 million for the 2022 fiscal year. The company's search for a buyer will now proceed while protected by Chapter 11, though the process could culminate in the business being wound down if it doesn't find a new owner.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/virgin-orbit-files-for-bankruptcy-protection-as-it-seeks-a-buyer-094236877.html?src=rss

## Jury reduces Tesla's $137 million racism lawsuit penalty to $3.2 million

<p>Back in 2021, a San Francisco court ordered Tesla to pay Owen Diaz, a former Black contract worker who accused the company of enabling a racist workplace, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-must-pay-ex-worker-137-million-in-discrimination-lawsuit-075729021.html">$137 million in damages</a>. It was one of the highest amounts awarded to an individual suing on the basis of discrimination, but the appeals that followed had lowered it significantly. While US District Judge William Orrick <a href="https://www.engadget.com/judge-reduces-137-million-payout-tesla-racism-lawsuit-051843072.html">affirmed</a> the jury's original verdict, he found the original damages awarded to Diaz &quot;excessive&quot; and lowered the total to $15 million. Now, a San Francisco federal jury has reduced the amount even further and has ordered Tesla to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/03/tesla-ordered-to-pay-more-than-3-million-over-hostile-workplace.html">pay Diaz $3.2 million</a> only.&nbsp;</p><p>The former elevator operator at Tesla’s Fremont assembly plant <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-worker-rejects-fifteen-million-award-racial-abuse-lawsuit-004823598.html">rejected</a> the $15 million award Orrick had proposed and instead sought for a retrial. In the latest hearing, Diaz again recounted his experiences working for Tesla, where he said he and his fellow Black workers were subjected to racial slurs. He also said that he was made to feel unsafe at work and that other workers left drawings of swastika and racist graffiti, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inki">Inki the Caveman</a>, in his workspace and the company restrooms.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Diaz's lawyers urged the jury to penalize Tesla, a company currently worth over $600 billion, an amount that will get its attention. But Tesla's lawyer Alex Spiro reportedly argued that Diaz should only be awarded half his salary. He apparently characterized Diaz as a liar in court, who misstated how long he worked at the automaker and who exaggerated his testimonies and the abuse he suffered to gain a bigger payout.&nbsp;</p><p>We may not be seeing the end to this case, though. According to the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-04-03/san-francisco-jury-slashes-teslas-137-million-racism-suit-tab"><em>Los Angeles Times</em></a>, Diaz's lawyer believes the jury decided on awarding him only $3 million in punitive damages and $175,000 in non-economic damages because he was wrongly attacked by the defense. He said Tesla's strategy to &quot;minimize and sanitize&quot; worked and that he has already filed a request for a new trial due to &quot;misconduct.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/jury-reduces-teslas-137-million-racism-lawsuit-penalty-to-32-million-060414307.html?src=rss

## Rode's Wireless ME squeezes a second mic into its receiver

<p>When Rode released the original Wireless GO, it was an instant success. The ease of use, audio quality and reasonable price made wireless microphones much more accessible. In fact it was so successful that it spawned a number of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dji-mic-clip-on-lapel-175000217.html">copycat</a> products from <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL21hY2tpZS5jb20vZW4vcHJvZHVjdHMvbWljcm9waG9uZXMvZW0td2F2ZS9lbV93YXZlX1hMUi5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlMGIwOTJkYS1iODgyLTRkODYtODc5MC00OGUzMWNmM2IzNDMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZd58sKghbckDsQc2MFy_yb6wlb9WaJKrhvNx0T9nzuQ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fmackie.com%2Fen%2Fproducts%2Fmicrophones%2Fem-wave%2Fem_wave_XLR.html&amp;uuid=AwkbAF6NBO3MeuvN0936">rivals</a>. After releasing the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rodes-wireless-go-ii-unveiled-150043322.html">Wireless GO II</a> ($299) with dual mics, the company is back with a more affordable option - the $149 <a href="https://rode.com/es/microphones/wireless/wireless-me">Wireless ME</a>. There’s also a new video app called Rode Capture aimed at creators which offers tight integration with the Wireless ME and other products from the company.</p><p>If you’re thinking “more affordable” means fewer features, then you’d be right. But also you might be surprised. Even though there initially appears to be just one transmitter (mic) and one receiver, the latter also has a mic built-in so you can still record two speakers at the same time with their own separate audio files. That said, Rode is calling the second mic the “ME mic” and describes it as a “narrator” microphone because you can’t use it wirelessly (it’s the one that plugs into your recording device) so it can only really be used by someone off camera. That obviously is no problem if you’re not recording video, but worth knowing if you are.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There are, of course, other minor compromises. For one, the receiver doesn’t have any type of display, so visual feedback for connectivity is limited to a pair of LEDs. There doesn’t appear to be any feedback for gain levels at all. There’s also no onboard storage for recording away from a camera, computer or a phone. This also means there’s no option to record a safety track at a lower gain level which, given the lack of a way to see levels means you’ll have to really be sure you have everything set right up front. As a reminder, though, the ME is half the price of the GO II.</p><figure><img alt="Rode's Wireless ME lav mic system connected to a phone." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/f6465890-cc87-11ed-bad6-824e6425a92b" style="height: 1240; width: 2000;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Photo by James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>There are tools to help, though. The Wireless ME comes with a feature called GainAssist which internally monitors the signal and sets levels automatically depending on your environment and the volume of the subject. This definitely helps keep things from clipping, but you can still go into the red with it. It appears to be using either a limiter or compression (or both) but you can still make it go into the red. There’s a “dynamic” mode too for when recording things with a more consistent volume than speech.</p><p>In terms of range, you can expect about 100 meters / 328 feet (line of sight) but in practice this can vary a little in either direction depending on the conditions. This is a shorter range than the Wireless GO II (200 meters / 656 feet) and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dji-mic-clip-on-lapel-175000217.html">DJI’s Mic</a> (250 meters / 820 feet) but likely ample for most scenarios. As for battery life, it’s a respectable seven hours but there’s no charging case as with DJI or <a href="https://uk.ankerwork.com/products/a3320-m650-wireless-microphone">Anker’s</a> solutions.</p><p>With no way to change settings directly on the device, you’ll want to get familiar with the Rode Central app. It’s here where you’ll be able to turn the receiver’s microphone on or off if you want to use it, change whether it records to one or two separate files (if using both mics) and adjust the gain settings. There are versions for both desktop and mobile (Android/iOS) so you can change modes on the go, even if it’s a bit more involved than doing it on the receiver as with DJI and Anker’s products.</p><p>Given that the narrator-guest setup isn’t ideal for recording two speakers on camera at the same time it's a shame that the receiver doesn't have the option to plug an external 3.5mm lav mic into it. This would mean you could theoretically run one with a longer cable and have two on camera hosts. You can still use 3.5mm mics with the main transmitter though. Alternatively, if you have access to another transmitter, such as a Wireless GO II, you can pair it with the ME’s receiver and record up to three people at the same time – though two of them will have to share an audio channel in case having separate files for all speakers is important to you.</p><figure><img alt="Screenshots of Rode's new video recording app " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/bd2dec50-cc8a-11ed-bdff-422115f583a3" style="height: 1007; width: 2000;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Rode</div></figure><p>The interoperability between the Wireless GO II and the ME shows that Rode is thinking about how these products can work together, meaning creators can collaborate seamlessly with their own gear or continue using older products even as new ones come around. Expect to see more interoperability with other wireless devices in the future.</p><p>Along with the new microphone kit is the aforementioned <a href="https://rode.com/es/software/rode-capture">Capture app</a>. It’s a dedicated video app with a twist: direct access to the settings of compatible Rode microphones. Most video apps don’t even let you know what mic you’re using which can cause anxiety when you’re not sure it’s working with the one you plugged in.
