<p>Windows may get all the press coverage, but when you want to get real work done, you turn your attention to the applications that run on it. And if you use spreadsheets, that generally means Excel.</p><p>Excel is, of course, part of Microsoft’s Office suite of productivity tools. Microsoft sells Office under two models: Individuals and businesses can pay for the software license up front and own it forever (what the company calls the “perpetual” version of the suite), or they can purchase a Microsoft 365 or Office 365 subscription, which means they have access to the software for only as long as they keep paying the subscription fee.</p><p>When you purchase a perpetual version of the suite — say, <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3261024/review-office-2019-is-the-best-advertisement-yet-for-office-365.html">Office 2019</a> or <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3635689/what-s-new-in-office-2021.html">Office 2021</a> — its applications will never get new features, whereas Microsoft 365 apps are continually updated with new features.
