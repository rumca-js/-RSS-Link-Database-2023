Aside from the overall appearance of your player, which can look just like you using the facescan option, the more important choices like this one lie in the other options on the \"Create a Player\" screen. After you are done customizing how your player will look, you are immediately given the option to create or choose a batting stance and animation.</p><p>Players who decide to create their own batting stance will be given an almost overwhelming number of options to choose from. There's the hand rotation, hand waggle rotation, and the back elbow offset settings that all need to be adjusted, among a plethora of others. For those who might not want to mess with these settings themselves, you are also able to choose a batting stance from a list of generic stances, as well as those from current and former players. This is where most players will be drawn, as it allows you to simply pick a batting stance with existing settings.</p><p>However, choosing an existing batting stance comes with its own set of challenges. Certain stances affect your overall contact and power as well as your swing animation and position of the bat.

The first Mermaid Barbie was a Gold Label collector item designed by Linda Kyaw and released in 2012. The Gold Label designated the doll as a collector's item with 4,300 made. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Emma Mackey as Nobel Prize Winner Barbie</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15976769/4121673-emmamackey.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>While Barbie doesn't have a Nobel Prize doll--yet--three dolls are focused on science.

While not dressed as any particular Ken doll, Evans is donning a look that seems to be a mix of Cowboy Ken and the long-forgotten Campus Hero Ken attire. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Ana Cruz Kayne as Supreme Court Justice Barbie</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15976769/4121726-anacruzkayne.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Introduced in 2019, the Judge Barbie line was released for Barbie's Career of the Year. \"The Barbie Judge Doll encourages girls to learn more about making decisions to change the world for the better,\" Mattel said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Barbie/status/1181246579497472000?ref_src=twsrc^tfw|twcamp^tweetembed|twterm^1181246579497472000|twgr^4d6c8684a83357b5526c2927be7b6ca53fe13a36|twcon^s1_&amp;ref_url=https://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/ny-mattel-judge-barbie-career-doll-20191008-nni2gv4drvdavaqmxt3xr5q3n4-story.html\">at the reveal</a>. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Sharon Rooney as Lawyer Barbie</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15976769/4121733-sharonrooney.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The Scottish actress is playing a Barbie first. Lawyer Barbie was never an official doll, but an outfit part of the Cool Career fashion line. There were Elle Woods dolls released as part of the Legally Blonde tie-in, but nothing official as part of the Barbieland careers. How else did she become a judge though? </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Emerald Fennell as Midge</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15976769/4121755-emeraldfennell.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Midge's history is pretty interesting and maybe one of the most in-depth character profiles in all of Barbieland. Margaret \"Midge\" Hadley Sherwood was introduced in 1963 around the same time as Barbie's cousin, Skipper (who is so far absent from the movie). </p><p>Midge was marketed as Barbie's best friend and later revamped as part of the Happy Family line and was sold as \"pregnant\" as seen in the poster.

Not to be confused with Midge's partner Alan, Allan with two L's was created as Ken's best friend. Ken's buddy came with the notable feature of being the same size as Ken so all of Ken's clothes fit him as well.</p><p>The last Allan doll was released almost 10 years ago as part of the Double Date 50th Anniversary Giftset.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Ritu Arya as Pulitzer Winner Barbie</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15976769/4121761-rityarya.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The Umbrella Academy star and drummer is another non-canonical Barbie, but the company did celebrate the life of Ira B.

We've all seen dolls tattered with awful haircuts and crudely applied makeup. These dolls were treated as art projects for toddlers and given not exactly the best ensembles. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Ryan Gosling as Ken</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15976769/4121803-ryangosling.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>Gosling plays the original Ken, Ken Carson, who was created in 1961, just two years after Barbie. Ken was named after Kenneth Handler, son of Barbie creator Ruth Handler, just as Barbie was named after her daughter, Barbara. </p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Nicola Coughlan as Diplomat Barbie</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15976769/4121806-nicolacoughlin.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>The Bridgerton Star is yet another new Barbie for the film.

Since then she's scaled back her looks taking on a more modest approach to presidential fashion sticking to pencil skirts and pantsuits. Rae will be the first Black President Barbie. </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>Will Ferrell as CEO of a toy company</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1597/15976769/4121823-willferrell.jpg\" /><br /><h3><p>We're still really not quite sure of Ferrell's purpose aside from him being a nameless toy company CEO.

gaming devices as much as they are considered phones and social media scrollers. iPhones and Android devices are capable of playing fully realized, visually impressive experiences, whether natively or via streaming. And with big-name titles like Diablo Immortal, Into the Breach, and Genshin Impact now available on mobile, as well as a vast library of awesome games to stream for <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=225336X1707200&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/xbox-game-pass-ultimate/cfq7ttc0khs0?icid=CNavAllXboxGamePassUltimate\">Game Pass Ultimate subscribers</a>, there's never been a better time to really dive into the mobile scene. Many games are being ported from console and PC platforms and are nearly indistinguishable from their source material, but touchscreens still don't make for the best gaming experiences. Below you will find our suggestions for the best phone controller options for the kinds of experiences you want to have on your mobile device.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">When it comes to picking the best phone controller for you, there are a lot of different choices to consider, from official pads that require mobile controller clips to third-party ones that don't. Fortunately, you probably already own a great controller that'll work with your phone, as both the official Xbox Wireless Controller, PS5 DualSense, and even <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ios-adds-support-for-switch-pro-and-joy-con-controllers/1100-6504278/\">Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons</a> can be connected to Android or iPhone via Bluetooth. Still, you may want to consider a mobile controller that's specifically designed for gaming on a phone, and we've included some of the best options for that below.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">There's a lot of variety here--some controllers connect directly to your phone's USB-C port, while others are Bluetooth-enabled. Some mobile controllers clip onto either side of your phone to resemble Joy-Cons, while others feel similar to a traditional console controller with a phone clip at the top. There is even an option for connecting your giant iPad to a controller. Whether you need an Android or iPhone controller, you'll find something to suit your needs here.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-mobile-controllers-for-iphone-and-android-gaming/1100-6480895/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>", "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-mobile-controllers-for-iphone-and-android-gaming/1100-6480895/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f", "date_published": "2023-04-04 14:16:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/mashup", "title": "Fortnite: Where To Bounce Off A Tire, A Lily Pad, And An Air Vent In One Match", "description": "<p>It's a fresh week in <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/\">Fortnite</a>, which means there are some new challenges to knock out to help you earn some XP and unlock this season's bonus cosmetics.
