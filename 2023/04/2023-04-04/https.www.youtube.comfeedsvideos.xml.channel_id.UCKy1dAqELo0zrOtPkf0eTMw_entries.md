Everspace 2 reviewed by Jon Bolding on PC, also available on PlayStation and Xbox.

This sequel is pure, distilled video game, all about how its space combat action plays moment to moment rather than whether that makes sense in a game world or fits a complex and nuanced story. The story could be better written, more entertaining, and set in a more original universe, and the missions or enemies could have more variety. But those faults didn't take away from the main reason you're there: To play with cool spaceships, tweak weapons into fun and crazy-powerful new combos, and meet new people to blow up.

Despite what internet forums will tell you, gamers love EA...well, at least their games. The publisher consistently leads other major console game publishers in monthly active users, with their sports titles being strong performers. In other news, the latest wave of games coming to Xbox Game Pass this month have been revealed. Loop Hero is out today, while Ghostwire Tokyo finally makes it to Xbox on April 12 after a year of PlayStation exclusivity. NHL 23 and Minecraft Legends hit the service on April 13 and 18, respectively. And there's more! Check out IGN.com for the full list. In Nintendo news, Pokémon Stadium hits the Switch Online service this month, for those who subscribe. It comes with online play, but sorry, there's no way to move your Pokémon from your GBA games to this game. And finally, Xbox has a new controller, this one made from recycled material in honor of Earth Day. Neat!

Meet Your Maker review by Travis Northup on Xbox Series X/S, also available on Playstation 5 and PC.

This is an awesome action game that beautifully executes on a terrific concept. It’s missing some depth in its tools of destruction, has some bugs and wonkiness, and its thin story is a big ol’ nothing burger, but as a starting point for another live-service game from the team that brought us Dead By Daylight, it's extremely impressive. Running through dungeons to best whatever unknown deviousness your fellow players have left for you is a great time, limited only by what the community can concoct, and building your own bases is the ultimate reward for your hard work that never stops being hilarious.

The Great War: Western Front reviewed by Leana Hafer on PC.

World War One rarely gets to shine so authentically in a strategy game, but portraying it with accuracy doesn't always translate into a good time. It's easy to feel bogged down when you might go several turns without any significant changes in the overall situation, with a successful offensive in one area completely offset by enemy momentum somewhere else. Still, it wouldn't really be World War I without these elements, and Western Front can still be a good time.

In the conclusion of J.R.R. Tolkien's epic masterpiece, The Lord of the Rings, as armies mass for a final battle that will decide the fate of the world--and powerful, ancient forces of Light and Dark compete to determine the outcome--one member of the Fellowship of the Ring is revealed as the noble heir to the throne of the Kings of Men. Yet, the sole hope for triumph over evil lies with a brave hobbit, Frodo, who, accompanied only by his loyal friend Sam and the hideous, wretched Gollum, ventures deep into the very dark heart of Mordor on his seemingly impossible quest to destroy the Ring of Power.

Prior to the film, audiences will be treated to an introduction from Elijah Wood (Frodo) discussing the impact of the LOTR trilogy and why fans return again and again to immerse themselves in this storyworld. With recent footage captured at LA Comic Con of the World Premiere of the brand new LOTR Roleplaying tabletop game in Lost Odyssey: The Red Scribe, Elijah takes audiences through this limited fan event with a celebrity cast to raise support for Extra Life for Kids, a program of Children's Miracle Network Hospitals.

But with a truly fun Corpse Explosion build comes lots of little tweaks to skill trees and playstyle, so we’re gonna go over our best tips in this guide to build the best darn corpse exploder in the business, up until the beta cutoff at level 25.

While understanding that there are many fans who have important childhood memories attached to the game and therefore they must approach the characters with the same passion and care, there's also an understanding that the movie has to work on its own to evoke those memories and make audiences feel the same feelings they had while playing the games.

Ravenbound reviewed by Jarrett Green on PC.

"There is no part of Ravenbound that is absolutely bad – in fact, most of it is a good foundation for a fun roguelike, from its solid combat to its interesting setting and enemies. But so much of Ravenbound feels like it’s either missing a key piece that would elevate it or is just poorly executed, with frustratingly unpredictable loot and obnoxiously obtuse systems. On top of that, it’s infested with bugs that take those issues from disappointing to outright annoying. There’s certainly some fun to be had in Ravenbound, but it’s hard to recommend leaving the nest to find it."

Right off the heels of WWE Wrestlemania 39, we have the lowdown on the WWE, UFC merge! WWE and the UFC are joining forces thanks to the UFC’s parent company, Endeavor Group. The two powerhouse entertainment fighting giants will be forming a new company that’ll apparently be valued at over $21 billion dollars. This definitely comes as shocking news to WWE fans, but it’s no surprise that a move like this occurred. Back in 2003, the #WWE bought ECW, saving the company from bankruptcy. Before that, the WWE scooped up WCW assets and wrestlers in 2001, making the WWE the largest and only wrestling entertainment company on national television at the time. we’ll have to wait and see what the WWE and #UFC is cooking up, but we break down what it all might look like. From one set of fighters to another, Legendary has plans for the Street Fighter franchise! Moving over to Disney Plus news, we got our first peek at Marvel’s Secret Invasion with this trailer, starring Samuel L. Jackson’s Nick Fury. We also have an update on The Last of Us season 2, and so much more on IGN The Fix Entertainment with host Akeem Lawanson.

On today's Daily Fix:

There's some bad and worse news coming for fans of survival game Ark. The developer, Studio Wildcard, announced that the upcoming sequel starring Vin Diesel has been delayed into sometime in 2024. The studio cited Unreal Engine 5 as the reason why the studio needs more time, which is understandable as it's a new engine and the developers need to learn all its new tricks to make a better game. So if you were excited to play the sequel this year, that's the bad news. If you want to continue playing the original Ark as it exists currently on last-gen consoles, or PC, here's the worse news: the servers will be taken down and your progress won't carry over into the new game. There's a (not free) remaster coming, but it won't be compatible with existing save data. Oh, and you'll have to buy all the DLC again if you want to play that. Ouch. In Resident Evil news, there's a game-breaking bug discovered in the RE4 remake, but don't worry, Capcom's on it. We'll also tell you how to avoid it. And speaking of Resident Evil 4, the voice actor for Ada Wong is being cyberbullied off social media. Many fans were disappointed with her performance, but as some keyboard warriors tend to do, they brought race into it.
