First released in 2000, <em>Stadium</em> is a battle-focused <em>Pok\u00e9mon</em> game featuring the original 151 pocket monsters. </p>\n<p id=\"O5nxNy\">The thing is, this version of <em>Stadium</em> has a very big catch (no pun intended): you can\u2019t transfer any of your own pok\u00e9mon to the game. When I was a kid, part of the appeal of the game was bringing over my well-trained <em>Pok\u00e9mon Red</em> with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_Pak\">the N64 Transfer Pak</a> so they could duke it out in glorious N64-era 3D. Without the transfer feature, it seems you\u2019ll have to instead rely on the game\u2019s rental teams, which probably won\u2019t be as satisfying as coaching my own beloved Butterfree to victory.</p>\n<p id=\"4GoEtw\">Nintendo...</p>\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/4/23669641/pokemon-stadium-n64-nintendo-switch-online-release-date\">Continue reading&hellip;</a>\n  </p>", "link": "https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/4/23669641/pokemon-stadium-n64-nintendo-switch-online-release-date", "date_published": "2023-04-04 16:02:52+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml", "title": "GM-owned BrightDrop to add 4,000 electric vans to Ryder\u2019s fleets", "description": "<figure>\n      <img alt=\"An image showing a BrightDrop electric van with Ryder branding\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ydAgE49HTtQBDjpzqf2yZE4prag=/1x0:2218x1478/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/72146590/ryder_brightdrop_ev.0.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>Image: Ryder</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p id=\"twTfk1\">BrightDrop, the electric van company owned by General Motors, <a href=\"https://newsroom.ryder.com/news/news-details/2023/Ryder-to-Add-BrightDrops-Electric-Vehicles-to-Lease-and-Rental-Fleet/default.aspx\">will provide</a> 4,000 delivery vans to Ryder\u2019s rental fleet through 2025.
