Education, finance and construction are the sectors with the biggest gaps \u2013 all over 22%. Of the three, only construction has made significant progress towards shrinking it in the period since compulsory reporting was brought in. Well-known businesses with huge gaps include Lloyds, with 34.8%, and prestigious law firms. The figures are a reason for anger, as well as concern, for anyone who believes that men and women should be financially equal. But the most painful effects will be felt at the bottom of the income distribution. Women, particularly black and minority ethnic women, pensioners and lone parents are consistently over-represented among the poorest households.

There are traffic sounds and distant sirens, a helicopter passing over, its sound fading with it. Our approach is slow and low in the early winter afternoon, the distant horizon muffled by pollution. Here comes Wembley stadium, there on the right, just before we make a small turn and head over Willesden and Kensal Green, crossing the Westway.</p><p>Distantly at first, barely visible between other towers, a blackened smudge hoves into view and the sound dies. A red underground train passes through a station and the red cabin of an external lift descends the side of the blackened, burned-out tower. Sunlight penetrates the interior through the spaces where windows once were, falling on bare floors and the cavernous spaces that used to be carpeted and where interior walls, kitchens, beds, furniture and decorations once stood. Daylight excavates the gloom. Lattices of internal metal scaffolding shore up ceilings and workers are occasionally glimpsed among it all. Then they\u2019re gone. We do not linger either, as the camera makes its rounds. And all around are other buildings, other windows looking on.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/05/steve-mcqueen-grenfell-review-serpentine-gallery-london\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/05/steve-mcqueen-grenfell-review-serpentine-gallery-london", "date_published": "2023-04-05 12:12:15+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Sweden \u2018places on hold\u2019 deportation of UK woman with Alzheimer\u2019s", "description": "<p>Exclusive: Charities have called Kathleen Poole\u2019s removal order a \u2018cruel\u2019 misapplication of Brexit withdrawal agreement</p><p>An elderly British woman with Alzheimer\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/03/swedish-police-moving-ahead-plan-deport-uk-woman-alzheimers\">threatened with deportation</a> from Sweden has been given a stay following international condemnation over a move that was branded a cruel, inhumane and deeply shocking misapplication of the Brexit withdrawal agreement.</p><p>After interventions from the European Commission, the Labour MP Hilary Benn and the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, Kathleen Poole\u2019s family have been told the police must continue their preparation for the deportation but the actual removal of the 74-year-old has been \u201cplaced on hold\u201d.
