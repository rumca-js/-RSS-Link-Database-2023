It can open PDF documents, and edit them, as long as it's not an image.\n\nIf you're familiar with vector drawing programs, then Inkscape can also edit PDF documents. For more robust solutions, you have proprietary commercial solutions, including PDF Studio, Master PDF, Foxit PDF Editor, or WPS Office, but you'll have to pay for them.\n\nHow to manually sign a PDF:\n\nOkular can actually do that. You can use the manual drawing tool to write your signature, or you can add the ability to paste an image on top of a document, but it's convoluted. You have to go to settings, toolbars shown, enable the quick annotations toolbar, then click the \"configure button\", click \"Add\", select the type \"Stamp\", and click the little button next to the \"stamp symbol\" field, to pick your own hand drawn signature that you previously saved as an image. Afterwards, you can just add that to any document in one click from that quick annotations toolbar.\n\nYou can also open the PDF document in LibreOffice Draw or the GIMP, and add your image signature this way.\n\n\nHow to digitally sign a PDF:\n\nThe easiest way is to use LibreOffice. Open the LibreOffice suite, click File, then digital signatures, and then \"sign existing PDF\", then the \"sign document\" button at the top. It will list all the available existing signatures and certificates you have installed on your device, and you can pick the one you want.\n\nBy default, LibreOffice will look into Mozilla Firefox's certificates list, so you'll have to put your certificate file there. To do so, open FIrefox, then the main menu, Preferences, Privacy and Security, and then \"View Certificates\". Then click on \"authorities\" and \"Import\", and then the \"OK\" button, and you're done.\n\nOptical Character Recognition (OCR)!\n\nA simple option is GImageReader, an open source app that will let you import a document or image, and will recognize all the text inside, in a very large variety of languages. It can take a while to do its thing, but it works reliably, and it was able to extract text from scanned PDFs and images like a PNG.\n\nIf you prefer doing these tasks from the command line, then you have Tesseract OCR, which is actually what GImageReader uses in the background.\n\nHow to annotate a PDF:\n\nYour best option is probably Xournal++. It lets you open PDF documents, and draw all over them. You can highlight text, add hand drawn notes, shapes, type some text. It can even handle equations and graphs, and has a very customizable interface.\n\nHow to modify pages, split and merge PDF documents:\n\nIf all you need is modifying the pages in a PDF document, like reordering them, or deleting them, then you have PDF Arranger, a simple GNOME app that will run on any Linux desktop, and is available on Flathub.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ie7Jb1KiIBM", "date_published": "2023-04-05 16:04:12+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
