<p>Red Hare, a horse that makes the actors look like chicken-legged weaklings, helps pull the emotional strings in this maudlin going over of old ground</p><p>Old warhorse Jackie Chan, who still has a heap of movies in development, doesn’t look ready for the knacker’s yard quite yet. But that’s not the impression given by this valedictory-seeming and downright maudlin family action film, with its refrain of “Jumping down is easy, stepping down is hard”. Playing a one-time master Hong Kong stuntman who has been laid low by injury, Chan is seen watching reels of his classic spills – including <a href="https://youtu.be/_btZQLzuGxs?t=386">the iconic Police Story shopping mall plunge</a> – with all the misty-eyed reverence of Cinema Paradiso.</p><p>Ride On lays it on doubly thick: not only is Master Luo (Chan) partnered with Red Hare, a cute horse who all but talks, he is also rebuilding his relationship with estranged daughter Bao (Liu Haocun). Scraping a living by giving rides in comedy outfits to tourists outside movie studios, Luo and Red Hare are called back to stunt work when video of them tag-teaming some local debt collectors hits social media. Bao, still resentful of her dad for prioritising his career, agrees to become his agent. But the comeback is threatened when a pair of corporate goons turn up to auction off Red Hare, apparently someone else’s property.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/06/ride-on-review-jackie-chan-kung-fu-horse">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Harold Pinter theatre, London</strong><br />Some called it torture porn, others a masterpiece. Ivo van Hove brings Hanya Yanagihara’s novel to the West End, complete with spurting blood, relentless sadism and not a little nudity</p><p>Hanya Yanagihara’s sprawling, relentlessly graphic door-stopper of a novel about sexual abuse and self-harm divided the room when it was published in 2015. Some called it torture porn, others hailed it a masterpiece. So it is perhaps not surprising that its West End adaptation began making lurid headlines well before opening night.</p><p>Conceived and directed by Ivo van Hove, first in Dutch and now premiering in English, there have been reports of spurting blood, fainting fits and illicit mobile phone images of a naked James Norton, who plays the central, agonised figure of Jude St Francis.

<p>• Frenchman to the fore in 4-0 drubbing at Camp Nou<br />• Carlo Ancelotti’s team will meet Osasuna in final</p><p>This time it’s our turn, Carlo Ancelotti had said, but even he couldn’t have imagined it would end up this good. Barcelona had won three clasicos in a row; by the final minutes of the fourth, though, it was Karim Benzema who stood in the corner of the Camp Nou, arms wide, smile wider. In front of him, the home fans were heading for the exit and so were their team. The Ballon d’Or holder had just completed a hat-trick, slipping the ball past Marc-André ter Stegen to make it 4-0 on the night, 4-1 on aggregate, to carry Real Madrid into the Copa del Rey final for the first time in nine years.</p><p>It was the kind of image that can become immediately iconic, something in Benzema’s expression that spoke of the ease, the superiority, with which Madrid finally had won this. Barcelona had begun well but fell behind just before the break and had been broken for the best part of half an hour. With four men missing – Pedri, Ousmane Dembélé, Frenkie de Jong and Andreas Christensen – and obliged to open up in pursuit of a place in the final, the flaws they have hidden so well, domestically at least, were exposed again. Twelve points clear in the league, there will be no double. Instead, there are doubts that run deeper than just this defeat.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/05/real-madrid-put-barcelona-to-sword-with-karim-benzema-cup-hat-trick">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This was a painful lesson for West Ham in focus, finishing and discipline. A rampant Newcastle deserved this handsome victory at the London Stadium, if only because they succeeded in getting the basics right. They profited from Callum Wilson and Joelinton punishing some awful defending from West Ham, who could not take an opportunity to pull clear of the bottom three, and are closing in on the Champions League after their fourth consecutive win.</p><p>It was a rout for Eddie Howe’s side, who are too clinical and resilient to be undone by opponents as generous as this. Newcastle did not even have to be special. Indeed, they survived some awkward moments during a pulsating first half, but the result never truly felt in doubt. Newcastle were too quick and strong. They could have had more than five and had David Moyes staring into the middle distance after Joelinton rounded off the scoring in added time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/05/callum-wilson-and-joelinton-double-up-as-newcastle-thrash-west-ham">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This delicate, remorseless documentary looks at the apparent coercion, isolation and bullying of the members of Lighthouse – an organisation that made millions from its devotees</p><p>You might hope – briefly, and only if you hadn’t been paying attention to the world – that a programme called <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001krb2">A Very British Cult</a> was a sitcom, set in the suburbs, based around a sect designed as a cover for a deeply unattractive man to have sex with other people’s wives in a cul-de-sac. But alas, as is so often the case with optimistic interpretations, you would be wrong. A Very British Cult is a careful, delicate, remorseless investigation and anatomisation of the real suffering seemingly caused by an organisation known as Lighthouse.</p><p>Journalist Catrin Nye takes us through it step by step. First we meet the people who are willing to go on camera to talk about their experiences. There is Jeff, who was full of ambition but lacking direction when he crossed paths, during a self-improvement webinar, with a man called Jai Singh who was with Lighthouse and offered him personal mentorship. Singh told Jeff that he was very open, very teachable and had a great work ethic, and under his guidance Jeff did learn to speak and write better than before. It seemed only sensible to sign up for the £10,000 “Discipline programme” for a year of more intense mentoring. And to “invest” £25,000 after that to become an associate member and gain better access to the revered founder of the movement, Paul Waugh.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/05/a-very-british-cult-review-lighthouse-bbc-documentary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Parliament should examine the regulation, financing and accountability of the monarchy</p><p>“When there is a select committee on the Queen,” Walter Bagehot wrote in 1867, “the charm of royalty will be gone. Its mystery is its life. We must not let in daylight upon magic.” Yet as the Guardian’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2023/apr/05/revealed-royals-took-more-than-1bn-income-from-controversial-estates-king-charles-queen-duchies-cornwall-lancaster" title="">reporting</a> shows, the monarchy rests not on mantras and vapours, but on a solid financial foundation that has been deliberately shielded from parliamentary accountability. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/05/how-tory-royal-funding-deal-gave-rise-to-king-charless-potential-cash-windfall" title="">David Cameron</a> was more servant of the crown than of the people when he drew a veil around the monarchy so zealously. In 2011, the then prime minister wanted to end what he described in his memoirs as a “painful annual discussion … about whether individual members of the family were ‘good value for money’”. At a time when Mr Cameron, an ardent monarchist, was inflicting painful cuts to public services, he made it a priority to accommodate the then Queen’s long-held wish to protect herself from scrutiny.</p><p>The result was that the prime minister, the chancellor and the keeper of the privy purse now decide every year on the amount of money – in the form of a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sovereign-grant-act-2011-guidance/sovereign-grant-act-2011-guidance#determination-of-the-sovereign-grant" title="">sovereign grant</a> – the monarch receives from the government, free from troublesome MPs, civil society and newspapers who might suggest taking into account private royal resources, such as those derived from their landholdings. That was the recommendation of the <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmselect/cmpubacc/313/313.pdf" title="">public accounts committee</a> in 2005, which recognised that these were not inconsiderable sums. The Duchy of Lancaster and the Duchy of Cornwall together produce profits for the King and the Prince of Wales of more than £40m a year. Yet today the sovereign grant is set at a percentage of surplus revenue from the crown estate – a £16bn publicly owned property portfolio. A “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/05/how-tory-royal-funding-deal-gave-rise-to-king-charless-potential-cash-windfall#:~:text=A%20%E2%80%9Cgolden%20ratchet%E2%80%9D%20clause%20in,was%20guaranteed%20never%20to%20fall." title="">golden ratchet</a>” clause in the deal ensures that while funding for the monarchy could increase in line with crown estate profits, it was guaranteed never to fall. The grant has <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/real-terms-drop-in-kings-income-as-grant-frozen-gzgdzsx8v" title="">remained</a> at £86m since 2021.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/05/the-guardian-view-on-royal-finances-time-to-let-the-daylight-in">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Six years after reporting on wage differences was made compulsory, women still earn less than men. Their work as unpaid carers is one reason why </p><p>The difference between men’s and women’s median hourly pay in the UK has edged up since companies with 250 employees or more were forced to publish this information six years ago. From 11.9% in 2017-18, the gap <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/062e80a3-af13-4aef-9e11-942abc40f8dc" title="">rose to 12.2% last year</a> and stayed the same this year, according to analysis by the Financial Times. The proportion of employers paying men more than women has also risen, and now stands at 79.5%. This is not the result that those who pushed for compulsory reporting hoped for. The idea was that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/01/new-transparency-rules-helping-reduce-pay-gaps-lower-average-pay" title="">transparency would bring change</a>, through a combination of pressure from better-informed female workers and the embarrassment of bosses.</p><p>The headline figures conceal a huge amount of variation. Education, finance and construction are the sectors with the biggest gaps – all over 22%. Of the three, only construction has made significant progress towards shrinking it in the period since compulsory reporting was brought in. Well-known businesses with huge gaps include Lloyds, with 34.8%, and prestigious law firms. The figures are a reason for anger, as well as concern, for anyone who believes that men and women should be financially equal. But the most painful effects will be felt at the bottom of the income distribution. Women, particularly black and minority ethnic women, pensioners and lone parents are consistently over-represented among the poorest households. Worryingly, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/07/gender-pay-gap-for-higher-educated-uk-parents-has-grown-since-1970s-study" title="">research</a> suggests that where the pay gap has shrunk, this is due to the falling wage levels of low-paid men, as well as the beneficial impact of the minimum wage.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/05/the-guardian-view-on-the-gender-pay-gap-transparency-on-its-own-isnt-enough">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The mess gets messier as seemingly small differences between company and CWU become magnified</p><p>Virtually the only point of agreement between the Royal Mail and the Communications Workers Union (CWU) on Wednesday was that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/apr/05/royal-mail-may-face-more-strikes-as-talks-with-union-end-without-deal">talks ended</a> at about 1.30am in the morning. The reasons for the failure of negotiations were, inevitably, disputed.</p><p>The company cited differences over terms and conditions for new employees – or, more precisely, whether lower rates should be equalised with the rest of the workforce over three years or five. The union called this a “selective” account and pointed to factors that would affect current staff, including whether a proposed trial for a new method of sorting mail was really a trial or had already been chalked up by management as a major cost saving.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/apr/05/no-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel-for-royal-mail-negotiations">Continue reading...</a>

## Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes not fooled by improvement in Australia | Giles Richards

<p>Despite finishing second at Albert Park, Toto Wolff’s team have a mountain to climb and must pursue a new design direction</p><p>There can be no illusions for Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes as to where they stand in Formula One’s pecking order despite returning their best finish of the season at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/apr/02/max-verstappen-wins-australian-gp-as-chaotic-f1-race-finishes-under-safety-car">Sunday’s Australian Grand Prix</a>. Melbourne was their first celebratory moment thus far, but that they revelled in a second place is indicative of the mountain they have to climb. For a team that has dominated F1 for so long this is perhaps their greatest challenge yet.</p><p>Hamilton is no stranger to battling with an uncompetitive car, but the team this season will truly test their mettle. On a roll of eight constructors’ championships in a row between 2014 and 2021, confidence and control went hand in hand with a calm sense of direction. All of which is easier to maintain with a winning car.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/apr/05/lewis-hamilton-and-mercedes-not-fooled-by-improvement-in-australia">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘I love playing the ass’ – James Marsden on Cyclops, Sonic and his new ultimate prank show

<p>Tired of being Hollywood’s No 1 guy who doesn’t get the girl, the star of everything from The Notebook to Westworld has finally found his dream role – taking a solar panel salesman for a $100,000 ride in Jury Duty</p><p>In Jury Duty, an inspired new docu-style comedy series that blurs fact and fiction, James Marsden plays an obnoxiously awful caricature of himself who boasts about auditioning for a soon-to-be-disgraced director, throws a hilarious tantrum at a birthday party and gets involved in a bizarre sex act known as “soaking”. Marsden stars alongside Ronald Gladden, very much the Truman in this blend of The Truman Show and The Office, and the two first encounter each other as they’re about to enter a jury room, with Gladden eventually twigging that he recognises Marsden from his X-Men role as Cyclops. Marsden then mentions his recent part in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/16/sonic-the-hedgehog-review-jim-carrey-sega-video-game">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>. “Oh, I didn’t see that,” says Gladden. “I heard it’s a really bad movie.”</p><p>Marsden, the real Marsden, gives a hoot as he finishes telling me this story. “That’s comedy gold,” says the actor, who also played android gun-slinger Teddy in Westworld, and the poor guy Rachel McAdams dumps at the end of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/01/my-favourite-film-aged-12-the-notebook">The Notebook</a>. Marsden, it soon transpires, likes nothing better than getting a laugh at his own expense. We’re meeting at a fashionable hotel on the Sunset Strip, the actor’s LA base since moving to Austin, Texas, during the pandemic. He is still boyishly handsome at 49, all piercing blue eyes and cheekbones that could cut glass, but he insists that beneath the leading man looks, he’s a clown at heart. “I love playing the buffoon and the ass,” he says. “Someone who thinks they’re great at something but are clearly not. I’d much rather do that than play James Bond.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/apr/05/james-marsden-jury-duty-notebook-sonic-westworld-cyclops">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For fitness fanatics it can be galling to see our physical powers wane. The solution is to choose exercises to suit our age, and to find new interests</p><p>In a lot of ways, I feel bad for people who decided they hated unnecessary physical exertion during PE lessons and have given it a studied miss ever since. But in one important way, I don’t: if you avoid picking up a barbell or lacing up a pair of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/running">running</a> shoes until hitting middle age, you could roll into your late 40s faster and stronger than you have ever been. Whereas – and don’t feel too sorry for me, because I’m going to start showing off in a minute – at 44, the best way to describe my gym regime is probably “managed decline”.</p><p>Let’s get the showing-off out of the way first. In my 30s – I didn’t actually start going to the gym myself until I was 29 – I could do a squat with double my own bodyweight on my back, and run 5km in a shade over 21 minutes. I could pull a small van and do a no-handed (AKA aerial) cartwheel. I could, and I’m not exaggerating, hoist a Vauxhall Astra hatchback off the ground 11 times in 90 seconds. I did just that in a competition.</p><p>Joel Snape is a writer and fitness expert</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/05/my-personal-bests-are-behind-me-but-ive-found-the-secret-to-sustained-exercise">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘Taking photos here wasn’t easy. Stand still for too long and you’d get barged out of the way by busy shoppers – or whacked by a fin or a tail’</p><p>Drought, conflict and famine have racked Somalia, but there has been very little international coverage of its plight recently. I visited last November, hoping to draw attention to the humanitarian crisis facing its people, and document not just their struggles but also their resilience. I spent some time exploring the consequences of drought, the struggle of refugees and the problem of overwhelmed hospitals. But the sadness of those stories needed a counterweight. In Mogadishu, the capital, I found positive stories.</p><p>This is Hamar Weyne fish market, an important hub near the centre. I was amazed at its vibrancy. Hundreds of fishermen depend on the market to sell their catch: tuna, swordfish and the like, caught off the coast. It was full of energy, colour and people. Everyone was pushing through crowds, some struggling to carry these massive tuna out of the market. After documenting so much tragedy in the country, the market felt like a beacon of hope – a testament to the strength of people whose ordinary lives went on.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/05/bloodshed-mogadishu-fish-market-tariq-zaidis-best-photograph-somalia">Continue reading...</a>

A song about breaking cycles of inherited trauma, the Korean-American producer was inspired to write it not after a therapy session or deep meditation, but after watching her dog, Jiji, eat – and realising that she was raising Jiji in a similar way to how her parents and grandparents had raised her.</p><p>“My grandpa would make dinner for me and then tell me to eat fast – he was constantly pressuring me in this way that felt really visceral and violent, and I would have indigestion,” she says. “I found myself doing the same thing to Jiji – and while comical, it was also a serious realisation, an example of passing down vicious cycles. It was such a slap in my face.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/05/yaeji-music-allows-for-time-travel-and-for-us-to-understand-each-other-better">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Lesser politicians try to emulate Thatcher’s clever, contrarian chancellor. That’s risky in these very different times</p><p>In death this week at the age of 91, Nigel Lawson has been saluted by all wings of the Conservative party as a prophetic thinker and Tory exemplar for our times. Rishi Sunak led the way in this response, posting a <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/RishiSunak/status/1642988449258160128">photograph</a> of himself as chancellor that showed one of his own first actions in the Treasury was to hang a portrait of Lawson on his wall.</p><p>There can be no disputing that, between 1983 and 1989, Lawson was an immensely significant and consequential Tory chancellor. Nor that, at his peak, he was one of the most influential ministerial figures of the Margaret Thatcher decade. He then wrote the most important memoir by any senior figure of those years. But it is a big mistake, and a destructively common one in the modern Tory party, to see him as a changeless icon for today.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/05/nigel-lawson-tory-party-legacy-margaret-thatcher">Continue reading...</a>

<p>If something becomes appalling and unconscionable when you imagine it being done to a human, it should not be done to any other animal, writes <strong>Shannon Ray</strong></p><p>I agree with Elle Hunt’s view that the perceived intelligence of an animal shouldn’t determine whether or not we eat them (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/30/octopus-farming-turns-my-stomach-but-are-some-species-really-more-worthy-than-others">Octopus farming turns my stomach – but are some species really more worthy than others?, 30 March</a>). She is absolutely right that our idea of intelligence is biased towards human abilities, accounting for neither those cognitive areas in which animals outperform humans, nor those animals who simply haven’t been put through “intelligence tests” yet.</p><p>So, I find her conclusion – that we should eat higher-quality, more local meat – slightly baffling. Absolutely, we should avoid factory-farmed meat (both terrestrial and aquaculture), but we are kidding ourselves if we believe that there is any humane way to slaughter livestock or club octopuses. A general rule of thumb: if something becomes appalling and unconscionable when you imagine it being done to a human, it should not be done to any other animal, either – at least not by choice.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/05/we-shouldnt-eat-animals-whether-they-are-intelligent-or-not">Continue reading...</a>

## The coronation invitation reviewed – is Charles planning a pumping pagan party?

<p>Does the king actually wish to be crowned Arch-Druid, Master of the Hobby-Horse? That would appear to be the pagan message of the elegant, floral design – and its standout character, the leafy-faced Green Man</p><p>If the attractive, hand-painted invitation is anything to go by, the coronation will be a neo-pagan rite in which King Charles III is invested as Arch-Druid, Master of the Hobby-Horse and Lord of Summer Isle. That’s because the most prominent image in the intricate, joyous floral design – by heraldry artist Andrew Jamieson – is the wryly smiling face of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/24/uprooted-on-the-trail-of-the-green-man-nina-lyon-review">the Green Man</a>. This emerald visage, the standout feature in Jamieson’s elegantly swarming design, belongs to an ancient, pre-Christian divinity who can still be seen in the architecture of British medieval churches, a leafy mug among all the gargoyles.</p><p>The face of a fertility cult that existed at the margins of Christianity fits perfectly into Jamieson’s loving recreation of the playful natural imagery that is found in medieval art. In manuscripts from the era, the main text is usually religious and orthodox, while fun and fantasy are given free rein around the margins. Here, the official message of the invitation occupies a central empty square, while the Green Man and his ever-renewing natural kingdom sprawl around the edge in living colour.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/05/the-coronation-invitation-review-charles-pagan-party-king">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Serpentine Gallery, London</strong><br />The Oscar-winning director’s silent survey of the burnt tower makes this disaster of incompetence and corruption painful to witness – but impossible to ignore</p><p>At first, we hear birdsong as the screen lights up. The approach begins at London’s edge, passing over a mosaic of housing developments and the last fields, giving way to golf courses and playing fields and factory estates. There are traffic sounds and distant sirens, a helicopter passing over, its sound fading with it. Our approach is slow and low in the early winter afternoon, the distant horizon muffled by pollution. Here comes Wembley stadium, there on the right, just before we make a small turn and head over Willesden and Kensal Green, crossing the Westway.</p><p>Distantly at first, barely visible between other towers, a blackened smudge hoves into view and the sound dies. A red underground train passes through a station and the red cabin of an external lift descends the side of the blackened, burned-out tower. Sunlight penetrates the interior through the spaces where windows once were, falling on bare floors and the cavernous spaces that used to be carpeted and where interior walls, kitchens, beds, furniture and decorations once stood. Daylight excavates the gloom. Lattices of internal metal scaffolding shore up ceilings and workers are occasionally glimpsed among it all. Then they’re gone. We do not linger either, as the camera makes its rounds. And all around are other buildings, other windows looking on.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/05/steve-mcqueen-grenfell-review-serpentine-gallery-london">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The middle film in the Colours trilogy features Julie Delpy as it takes a dagger to both France and Poland’s conception of equality and meritocracy</p><p>This is the second movie in Krzystztof Kieslowski’s great Colours trilogy, now on rerelease; here white is the colour of death, the colour of winter, the colour of orgasm (a climactic, screen-filling flash of pleasure) and also the colour of a clean slate and a fresh start about to be muddied and spoiled. Theoretically, it addresses not just the middle colour of the French flag, but the second tenet of the revolution as well – equality – which it does by dramatising some outrageous inequality. It also satirises the specious new equality and meritocracy of gangster capitalism, on the rise in post-Soviet Poland.</p><p>Working again with composer Zbigniew Preisner, Kieslowski audaciously jolts the tone away from the dreamy, tragic and cosmic loneliness of Blue (whose protagonist, Juliette Binoche, is glimpsed again here) to a vinegary black comedy of marital breakdown, poverty and immigrant anxiety; it also contains one of the biggest, bleakest laugh lines in European cinema. Karol, the poverty-stricken Polish hairdresser in Paris has no money or passport, and finds he can only get back to Poland by stowing away in a trunk belonging to a Polish acquaintance. In Warsaw, this expensive-looking trunk is stolen by crooked baggage handlers who are furious to find only a homeless man inside. After being savagely beaten, Karol looks around at a snowy-white rubbish dump and gasps: “Home at last!” No one could accuse Kieslowski of romanticising his homeland.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/05/three-colours-white-review-kieslowski-julie-delpy-black-comedy-gangster-capitalism">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ahead of the coronation of King Charles III, the Guardian’s Cost of the crown series exposes the entrenched secrecy around the royal family’s money and wealth</p><p>How much money will the coronation of King Charles III cost the British public? What tax rate will our new king pay on his private income? How many engagements did “working royals” such as the Dukes of Gloucester and Kent attend over the last five years? How much were they paid? How much rent do Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, who are not working royals, pay for residences in royal palaces?</p><p>In recent weeks, the Guardian has posed all of these questions to Buckingham Palace. The responses boil down to “ask someone else”, “work it out for yourself”, or simply “you have no right to know”. We beg to differ.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/05/how-the-british-royal-family-hides-its-wealth-from-public-scrutiny">Continue reading...</a>

What if I hadn’t listened to her? What if I had watched her do it first? What – I think while applying brow pencil every single morning – if we had never met? So news that people are partially shaving the ends of their eyebrows using a razor is nothing short of chilling, at least to anyone born in the 1980s.</p><p>Still, the point of growing older is to learn, as Sherrille Riley, founder and CEO of <a href="https://nailsandbrows.me/">Nails &amp; Brows</a>, a salon in London’s Mayfair, says: “We all did it so perhaps every generation must make their mistake now and repent later.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/apr/05/bella-hadid-lift-straight-eyebrow-trend-tiktok">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Stipends, palace maintenance, staff costs and taxes all differ, but the British royals are given the most taxpayer money</p><p>Comparing the cost of Europe’s royal dynasties is akin to comparisons between apples and oranges. Each family is unique, and each government has a different way of paying for them. Some royal budgets cover the cost of maintaining palaces, staff and security; others are limited to annual stipends to individual kings or queens.</p><p>Tax is paid by some European royals but not others. Some countries are highly transparent, providing detailed breakdowns of how public money is spent on individual royals. Others are more opaque, with royals supplementing an official government lump sum with other quasi-private sources of income. One thing, at least, is clear: European royal families come with vastly different price tags.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/05/windsors-v-borbons-comparing-the-public-pay-of-european-royal-families">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I was reunited with my cousin in Canada. But knowing I may never see my family in Damascus again hurts</p><p>I would have to wait more than a decade to see my cousin Lujain again. That last time, we were teenagers; I was 16 and she was 19. It was the Easter holidays in 2010 and I was in Syria on holiday with my mum, dad and brother. My dad is Syrian and every few years we would go to Damascus to visit my grandmother, aunts, uncles and cousins. I looked forward to seeing them and we were always able to just pick up where we left off. After the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/14/syria-protesters-defections-security-forces">war began in 2011</a>, my Syrian family became displaced around the world.</p><p>Lujain and I began reconnecting online in 2020 during the pandemic. She now lives in Canada with her husband, Hasan, and their two little boys. Together, we began to explore our differing memories of Syria – mine full of nostalgia and Lujain’s fragmented and painful. A lot of families go through a natural separation over time; people emigrate in pursuit of a career or different lifestyle. The difference with our family is that this physical distance was never a choice – the decision to leave Syria was based on an instinct for survival.</p><p>Laura Wadha is a Scottish/Syrian documentary film-maker and graduate of the National Film and Television School.

<p>From coffee to baked beans, and Coca-Cola to milkshakes, readers name the foods that make them retch – and unpack the emotions behind their aversion</p><p>Tomato ketchup, and the tomato sauce that comes with canned baked beans and spaghetti hoops, make me shudder. The sweet, vinegary smell is something I can’t seem to get over. It makes my every nerve seize up and I end up holding my breath. I won’t make a fuss about it, but I don’t like holding ketchup bottles or holding plates with leftover ketchup on them. When I was younger, this aversion extended to mayo, barbecue sauce and other condiments, but I am happy to eat most of those now. I have a vague memory of someone smushing a sandwich with ketchup into my face as a child and the feeling of it being around my mouth and cheeks. While I’ve occasionally eaten some accidentally, I’m pretty sure I’ve never dipped a chip or a nugget into ketchup in my life. <strong>Becci Wood, 31, London </strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/apr/05/guardian-readers-on-their-most-hated-foods">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Signed as the ‘Backstreet Boys of emo’ in the 90s major-label boom, the band became hated by the scene they spawned. Two decades later, they explain why Covid and grief spurred them to finish their second album</p><p>Southend-on-Sea in the 90s was a mess: a tatty, former picture-postcard town where seaside dilapidation washed up against homogenous suburbs. Its claim to fame was the world’s longest pleasure pier: a path to nowhere stretching into the Thames estuary mudflats. Culturally, things followed suit. The wider area dined out on its reputation as the birthplace of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/depeche-mode">Depeche Mode</a>, while its role as the centre of pub rock was not – at least prior to the canonisation of Wilko Johnson – something anyone under the age of 40 would boast about.</p><p>But amid tribute acts playing sad seafront venues, by 1994 there existed a vibrant, subterranean pocket of punk with two bands at its core: metalcore bulldozers Above All and the sharp, dissonant post-hardcore act Understand. These acts helped nurture and inspire a small circle of similarly minded bands: Outbreak, Pepperman, Stands to Reason, Raiden and a revivified Cynical Smile. The scene even stretched beyond Southend: Understand briefly stood on the brink of glory until an ill-fated dalliance with a big label prompted a backlash among their peers and ultimately led to their breakup before they could release a second album. But 25 years later, their album Real Food at Last is finally seeing the light of day (on the major label-backed Rise Records, no less).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/05/understand-on-the-90s-punk-scene-that-shunned-them">Continue reading...</a>

## Top Hat review – stylishly madcap dance film with Astaire and Rogers cheek to cheek

<p>This madcap musical from 1935 about an American dance star visiting London swirls effortlessly back into cinemas, with classic songs from Irving Berlin</p><p>Like a Shakespearian marriage comedy with a spoonful of Feydeau farce, this madcap musical from 1935, from screenwriters Allan Scott and Dwight Taylor and director Mark Sandrich, saunters back for a re-release. It features Fred Astaire as Jerry, the American dance star visiting London, a city seen in almost surreally weird back projections – and Astaire incidentally does an intentionally terrible Cockney accent when he pretends to be a hansom cab driver. (It is one of the rare times he does not appear in faultless evening dress.) Irving Berlin’s classic songs Cheek to Cheek and Top Hat, White Tie and Tails are great, and Astaire swirls on a forward-tilting gyroscopic axis with his spindly arms and legs effortlessly orbiting him like Saturn’s moons.</p><p>Playing opposite him – and of course, as she herself pointed out, doing the same thing as Astaire only backwards and in heels – is Ginger Rogers; she is Dale Tremont, a freethinkingly modern young American woman who has a romantic escapade with Jerry, but gets upset when she thinks he is the husband of her pal Madge (Helen Broderick). In a tizzy of emotional hurt Dale flees to Venice where she impulsively decides to marry her highly-strung Italian couturier Alberto Beddini (Erik Rhodes). Meanwhile Madge’s actual husband, theatre impresario Horace Hardwick (Edward Everett Horton), brings Jerry over to the Venice Lido: a quite extraordinarily camp flooded stage set of canals and bridges, like something from Las Vegas. Eric Blore gives us some very broad comedy as Bates, Horace’s grumpy manservant and master of disguise.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/05/top-hat-review-fred-astaire-and-ginger-rogers-go-cheek-to-cheek-irving-berlin">Continue reading...</a>

## In Poland, the Catholic church backed abortion bans and authoritarian politics. Young people are turning away | Maria Skóra

<p>The close ties between Poland’s ruling Law &amp; Justice party and the church appear to be alienating voters </p><p>The Catholic church in Poland is close to an existential crisis. For one of the most Catholic countries in the world, and the homeland of Pope John Paul II, this is unprecedented. Poland is not becoming an atheist country overnight, but the trend is indisputably towards secularisation, especially among younger Poles. This will have significant political consequences for the ruling national conservative Law &amp; Justice party (PiS), which has close ties with the church. Meanwhile, the country’s next parliamentary elections are due to take place this autumn.</p><p>The Catholic faith has long been one of the distinctive pillars of Polishness, and played an important role in the nation-making process. In times of partitions, Nazi occupation and communism, the Catholic church portrayed itself as a bastion of resistance in the long quest for Polish independence.

Then an activist group wrangles you into a scheme to bring down the giant corporation, whereupon both Kurt’s world and the game’s central premise begin to fall apart.</p><p>Initially, The Last Worker is built around a light simulation of Kurt’s daily routine. Using a hovering cart, you must locate assigned packages among the endless shelving units, and either transport them to a delivery chute or send them for recycling. Packages vary in size, weight, and condition, all of which must be checked before dispatch.

## The war against wild toileting: is there any way to stop people weeing – and worse – in the street?

<p>Public peeing has become commonplace, with some men even urinating through letterboxes. Why has it become so popular and can splashback paint put a stop to it?</p><p>When Paul came down the communal stairs at his block of flats in Soho, central London, he was faced with the sight of a young man outside urinating against the glass front door. The man was too drunk to notice Paul standing there, so Paul had to wait in the lobby until the man had finished. Living in an area surrounded by pubs and bars means dealing with public urination – and worse – is something he has grown used to. “It becomes normalised,” he says. “But that doesn’t mean it’s right.” His family are from Soho, and he says a lot of visitors aren’t aware there is a community who live there. When people realise and are apologetic, he doesn’t mind so much – it feels thoughtless, rather than disrespectful. It’s far worse, he says, when “you get people who are just belligerent or rude”.</p><p>Public toileting – or “wild toileting” as it has been called, like an antisocial version of wild swimming – has been a growing concern, particularly since Covid closed public loos, many never to reopen. That comes on top of a longer-term decline in public facilities – Raymond Martin, managing director of the British Toilet Association, estimates we have lost 50% of public toilets in the past 10 years. Meanwhile, cash-strapped councils’ street-cleaning budgets have been under pressure, as costs of cleaning, particularly during the pandemic, have risen. And according to a report by the <a href="https://apse.org.uk/index.cfm/apse/members-area/briefings/2023/23-11-street-cleansing-trend-analysis/">Association for Public Service Excellence</a>, public satisfaction at cleaning is at its lowest in five years.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/apr/05/the-war-against-wild-toileting-stop-weeing-street-urinating">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Period poverty is widespread in the US, and Covid worsened the crisis. Yet it remains ‘shrouded in stigma and shame’</p><p>Lynette Medley wasn’t usually shocked when a client divulged they’d done something illegal. As a sexual health therapist in Philadelphia, she focused on supporting vulnerable low-income people who engaged in risky and even criminal behavior. But she was appalled – and flooded with memories – when a young woman confided that she worked as a sex worker so she could afford to buy basic hygiene products, including tampons.</p><p>“How is this still happening?” Medley thought to herself. “I had to go through this pain. My daughter had to go through this pain – and nothing seems to have changed.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/05/period-poverty-menstruation-us">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Kenneth Faried’s talent earned him a slot on the Team USA roster and a $50m contract. But he found himself on the outside as NBA tactics changed</p><p>Kenneth Faried is around 7,200 feet above sea level. At times, though, the former Team USA starter and Denver Nugget, he has felt much lower. His G League season with the <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/CapitanesCDMX">Mexico City Capitanes</a> concluded in late March, the team <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba-g-league/boxscore/_/gameId/401482220">narrowly missing</a> the playoffs. But Faried <a href="https://stats.gleague.nba.com/player/202702/">played well</a>, averaging 11.3 points, 9.7 rebounds and 1.4 assists on the year. Still, he remains far from his ultimate goal. Many NBA fans probably remember the “Manimal” and his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZhxdbusPoQ">ferocious blocks and dunks</a>. From his rookie year in 2011, Faried defied expectations. At 6ft 8in, he rebounded in traffic like an 8-footer. But now, he’s working to get back to the league after the game changed under his feet. For a player known for his hustle, the question remains, can he chase down another chance? And can he do so ahead of 9 April, the last game of the NBA regular season and the final day to amend rosters? He’s trying. But the road can be unrelenting.</p><p>“For me, it was the depression,” Faried tells the Guardian, speaking about the ups and downs he’s gone through since leaving the NBA in 2019. “You go into depression. I went into depression.

<p>Affleck’s dramatisation of the bid to get Jordan to endorse Nike’s radical new sneaker almost ignores the most compelling character</p><p>There’s a lively all-star lineup here and, theoretically at any rate, a great true story from American sports with all the relatability your heart could desire. But this film winds up looking like the most expensive in-house corporate promo in history: shallow, parochial and obtuse. By the time the credits roll, we’re apparently supposed to be euphoric – not so much at individual sporting achievement, but at all the billions of dollars that Nike has been making.</p><p>In the mid-80s, a Nike executive called Sonny Vaccaro dreamed of signing up basketball star Michael Jordan to promote the revolutionary new Air Jordan sneaker, which was to be designed entirely for the basketball player – an integral part of his brand identity. Converse and Adidas had more money to offer, so Vaccaro drove to Jordan’s family home in North Carolina on a risky mission to bypass Jordan’s lawyers, agent and management team and instead befriend Jordan’s formidable mother, Deloris.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/05/air-review-ben-affleck-matt-damon-michael-jordan-nike-shoe">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The journalist and former in-patient offers a clear-eyed view of a debilitating and misunderstood illness</p><p>Hadley Freeman was 14 when a seemingly innocuous comment blew her life apart. Three years earlier her family had relocated from New York to London, and she enjoyed the special status that being American conferred on her among her British peers. But she struggled to find her place among teenage girls who were embracing bras and boys – “The grown-up world was pressing in, monsters making the door bulge inwards while I frantically tried to push it back.”</p><p>On this particular day, Freeman was in a PE lesson at school, sitting on the floor, legs outstretched, next to a girl named Lizzie. Noting Lizzie’s skinny legs, and her own “matronly trunks”, she asked Lizzie if it was hard to find clothes when you’re small. “Yeah,” she replied. “I wish I was normal like you.” At this, Freeman writes, “a black tunnel yawned open inside me, and I tumbled down it, Alice into Nowhereland. ‘Normal.’ Not ‘slim’, not ‘thin’ – ‘normal’. Normal was average. Normal was boring. Normal was nothing.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/05/good-girls-by-hadley-freeman-review-anorexia-from-within">Continue reading...</a>

The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, and his fellow ministers will pretend they wanted to boost benefits all along, while rightwing cheerleaders in the press will talk of Britain’s “generous” welfare state. The reality, though, is altogether different: millions of people who rely on the social safety net<strong> </strong>still won’t be able to afford to eat, stay warm, or clean.</p><p>The erosion of social security rates over the past 40 years has fundamentally broken the link between what state support provides and what it actually costs to live: basic benefits today are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/feb/26/uk-benefits-fall-short-of-minimum-living-cost-by-140-a-month-charities-say">at least £140 a month</a> below the real cost of food, energy and everyday essentials, according to recent research by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.

<p>Based on the life of the author’s great-aunt, this verse novel about forced child emigration from the UK to Canada is a profound act of witness </p><p>Liz Berry’s first poetry collection, 2014’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/21/black-country-liz-berry-review-poetry-collection" title="">Black Country</a>, fused the personal and political with disarming tenderness, its soaring imagery and soft dialect words from the West Midlands making beautiful whorls in the grain and flow of its music. The same was true of her poetry pamphlet, The Republic of Motherhood, in 2018. Now comes The Home Child, a novel in poetry: not continuous narrative, but a sequence of lyrical snapshots illuminating a story that is not only heartbreaking but also, essentially, true.</p><p>The Home Child is the story of Berry’s great-aunt Eliza Showell. When her mother died in 1908, Eliza was packed off at the age of 12 from a children’s emigration home in Birmingham to rural Nova Scotia, and put to work as an indentured domestic servant. She never returned, never raised a family, never saw her brothers again, and died in a care home. Between 1860 and 1960, Britain sent more than 100,000 “home children” to Canada. They were orphans, or had families too poor to care for them. In 2010, Canada’s Year of the British Home Child, Berry discovered Eliza’s small gravestone, paid for by her employers, in Cape Breton. After losing her mother and her childhood home, Eliza was pursued by the irony of that word “home” right to the grave.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/05/the-home-child-by-liz-berry-review-a-long-injustice">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In a new documentary, the woman who went from assistant to lover of the ex-Beatle talks about her side of a misunderstood story</p><p>Smack in the middle of the 1970s, John Lennon experienced what he famously called a “lost weekend”, echoing the title of a classic 1945 movie about an out-of-control alcoholic. Given that description, people naturally viewed that “weekend” – which actually lasted 18 months and which coincided with Lennon’s separation from Yoko Ono – as a period of great excess and deep regret. Yet, according to May Pang, who was Lennon’s 22-year-old live-in lover during that time, that was anything but the case. “He was getting to hang out with his friends and have a lot of fun,” she said. “And, because I was 10 years younger, we were getting to do all the things young couples do.”</p><p>Pang insists that the ex-Beatle only used the term “lost weekend” to refer to that time because he was tired of the press constantly asking him about two high-profile incidents in 1974 in which he was tossed from an Los Angeles club for being inebriated and verbally abusive. “He would sarcastically say to them: ‘Hey it was a drunken weekend, OK?’” Pang said. “People don’t understand that the phrase wasn’t about our relationship.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/05/lost-weekend-documentary-john-lennon-yoko-ono">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From the chain-smoking staff to the colourful fruit and veg, nowhere else makes me feel more happy and hopeful</p><p>If we ever receive a four-minute warning for the end of the world, you will find me standing beside a pile of apples arranged on a square of artificial grass, looking at vegetables. Because nowhere makes me feel more happy and hopeful than a greengrocers.</p><p>Whether it’s an end-of-the-pier root vegetable, a bunch of free carrot tops for my guinea pigs, exotic jewel-like pomegranates or blood oranges or a romanesco cauliflower to breakup the carbohydrate beige of Britain in April, a trip to the greengrocer is my most reliable source of wonder. Sadly, of course, fruit and veg are one of the things hit hardest by our current cost of living crisis, climate emergency and Brexit. Fresh food prices are up 17% in 12 months and in October 2022, The Grocer<em> </em>(I’m not yet a subscriber but I’m not ruling it out) found that “vegetable consumption in the UK has fallen by 7.5% over the past year, as consumers react to the cost of living crisis”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/05/my-most-reliable-source-of-wonder-a-trip-to-the-greengrocers">Continue reading...</a>

## Godland review – beauty and terror in magnificent study of church-building priest

<p>Hlynur Pálmason’s fictional account of a Danish pastor sent to Iceland in the 19th century is superb in its compositions and nuanced depictions of hostility</p><p>Harshness is transformed into beauty and then terror by this extraordinary film from Icelandic director Hlynur Pálmason about a 19th-century Danish pastor sent to establish a new church on Iceland’s remote south-eastern coast. I left the cinema dazed and elated by its artistry; it is breathtaking in its epic scale, magnificent in its comprehension of landscape, piercingly uncomfortable in its human intimacy and severity. There is such superb compositional sense in the still life tableau shots and the almost archaeological sense of time, creating something deeply mysterious and unbearably sad. There are echoes of Werner Herzog’s Aguirre, the Wrath of God, Roland Joffé’s The Mission, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/09/juaja-review-viggo-mortensen-in-existential-quest">Lisandro Alonso’s Jauja</a> – and even Howard Hawks’s Red River.</p><p>Pálmason announces in the opening credits that the story was inspired by the supposed discovery in Iceland of seven glass-plate photographs of people and places taken there at the end of the 19th century. While the claim is a deadpan fiction, his screen has an almost square 1.33:1 aspect ratio, perhaps in honour of the still photograph motif. This smaller-size, in such contradistinction to the movie’s CinemaScope ambition and spectacle, gives a density to the viewing experience.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/05/godland-review-hlynur-palmason">Continue reading...</a>

## Politicians are right about the ‘decline of the west’ – but so wrong about the causes | Owen Jones

<p>The problem is not moral decay. It’s the withering away of our living standards, security and wellbeing</p><p>If there is such a thing as an onward march of human progress,<strong> </strong>it has not just halted, but screeched into reverse. Last autumn, a <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/09/1126121">little-discussed report</a> issued by the United Nations noted that human development had declined in 90% of countries for two years in a row, a fall without precedent for more than three decades. The pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine played their role, but so too did “sweeping social and economic shifts, dangerous planetary changes, and massive increases in political and social polarisation”.</p><p>You may well be familiar with chatter about “the decline of the west”: it has tended to be the preserve of the reactionary right, who blame, variously, moral decay, multiculturalism and a reassessment of European history for our downfall. But it is not minority rights, diversity or acknowledgment of western crimes to blame. The turnaround in our collective fortunes has been dramatic. But it is driven by an economic system that promised personal freedom but instead delivered insecurity on a mass scale, and which has has hurt us in every conceivable way, from our emotional and physical wellbeing to our material circumstances.<strong> </strong><strong> </strong></p><p>Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/05/decline-of-the-west-causes-moral-decay-living-standards">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Profound, big-hearted, and raw, the adaptation of bestselling book Tiny Beautiful Things is powerful television. Its writer talks grief, sorrow and being friends for life with Reese Witherspoon</p><p>In 2011, a little-known fortysomething author called Cheryl Strayed was about to become huge. She had just sent a copy of her soon-to-be-published memoir, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/09/wild-journey-lost-strayed-review">Wild</a>, to Oscar-winning Hollywood star <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/reesewitherspoon">Reese Witherspoon</a>. It tells Strayed’s story about hiking the Pacific Crest Trail, while processing the turbulent events of her younger life that had taken her there – childhood abuse, her mother’s death from cancer, her heroin addiction and the breakdown of her marriage. Witherspoon read it within 48-hours and set up a call; she desperately wanted to bring the story to the big screen with her newly founded production company.</p><p>“It was exciting talking to Reese Witherspoon but I didn’t think: ‘Oh my God, whatever she wants – the answer is yes,’” says Strayed, now 54, from her LA office. “But we had this wonderful, deep conversation for about an hour on the phone. I could tell by the way that she spoke to me with such vulnerability and candour, that she was somebody I could trust. I wasn’t wrong about that.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/05/author-cheryl-strayed-interview-tiny-beautiful-things-tv-show">Continue reading...</a>
