All night. And all day. But somehow, this story might even be worse than that. (Maybe. That one's pretty bad.) </p><p>The sandwich chain just had to debut an absolutely disgusting \"Easter\" themed sandwich. On Good Friday of all days. The sandwich consists of Italian white bread and a Cadbury Creme egg melted in the middle. I literally had to check and make sure this wasn't an April Fool's joke. </p><p>The sandwich is only available in the UK this Friday, and they're actually giving them away for free. They're also only making 500 sandwiches. I simply cannot <em>imagine</em> why. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cSubway\\u2019s Cadbury Creme Egg Easter sandwich called \\u2018absolutely disgusting\\u2019 https://t.co/grIrvT9Yxv\\u201d</div> \u2014 New York Post (@New York Post)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nypost/status/1643683595318439936\">1680719681</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Charlotte Docker, brand executive for Cadbury Creme Egg, explained, <em>\"When Subway approached us to create this eggs-traordinary Submelt, we simply couldn\u2019t resist. The highly-anticipated Creme Egg season is in full swing and we\u2019re so excited to launch this innovative product with Subway as a final hoorah of the season.\" </em></p><p>The festive sandwich has received a less-than-welcome reception on social media. The people of Twitter had some choice words. One user wrote, \"Worst business decision since <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kid-rock-bud-light\" target=\"_blank\">Bud Light</a>.\" Another said they had to make sure it wasn't a Babylon Bee article. And one person simply asked, \"why?\"</p><p>Which I think we are all wondering. And I also wonder why the sandwich is available on Good Friday and not Easter. Plus, remember when Subway was marketed as the \"healthy\" <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/grandpa-mcdonalds-weight\" target=\"_blank\">fast-food</a> option? And now they're literally just melting chocolate on top of white bread. An interesting marketing strategy for sure. </p><p>But there is a slight silver lining- at least there's no question about what you're getting in this sandwich. Not like their <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/07/13/1111270816/subway-tuna-lawsuit\" target=\"_blank\">tuna</a>.

And by contrast, why New York is the way it is. (Side note: as a former New Yorkian and COVID refugee, I can definitively say I would 100% prefer the state of Florida.)</p><p>During his speech, the issue of minors surgically transitioning of course came up. DeSantis explained how, in Florida, the surgical transition of minors is prohibited and doctors will actually lose their licenses if they do it anyway. </p><p><em>\"It's sad that we even have to discuss this, but you've now seen an explosion in doctors with these young kids, minors, giving them puberty blockers, hormone treatment, and doing surgery, sex change surgeries of kids that are 15 and 16 years old.\" </em></p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201c.@GovRonDeSantis: \"You've now seen...an explosion with these doctors...doing...sex change surgeries of kids that are 15-16...\\n\\nWe don't think that's based on...science.

And, in fact, a lot of countries in Europe have said no this is really bad [...] If a Florida physician is doing this to minors they are going to lose their medical license in our state.\" </em></p><p> I actually am not able to find clear guidelines on when a child can begin transitioning in New York. Which makes me fear that there are none. But NYU Langone Health has a <a href=\"https://nyulangone.org/locations/child-study-center/gender-sexuality-service\" target=\"_blank\">\"Gender and Sexuality Service\"</a> that provides children and teens \"documentation necessary to move forward with gender-affirming medical interventions, including puberty suppression and gender-affirming hormone treatments.\" So that's...bad. </p><p>Florida is showing the rest of the country the way forward and a path out of this gender theory craziness. DeSantis has been one of the few Republican leaders refusing to compromise or back down from this issue. Hopefully, other conservative states will take note. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Lily is a Zoomer college dropout who somehow landed a writing gig here at LwC.com.

I get that it's beautiful - it has mountains <em>and </em>beaches. But also, it's hell. They trans the kids, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/california-legalize-child-kidnapping\" target=\"_blank\">take the kids away</a> from their parents, murder babies, support <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/san-francisco-police-36-hours\" target=\"_blank\">crime</a>, plus have<a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/california-snowstorm-woman\" target=\"_blank\"> extreme weather events</a>. I'm not sure how it could get much worse. But it probably can. And will. </p><p>The latest update on California's transformation into a desolate wasteland comes out of Glendale California's United School District. Assistant Superintendent Kelly King recently expressed how male coaches are uncomfortable with watching female students undress. Which seems perfectly normal and understandable to any human being. </p><p>But King's point is that these female students are actually boys, because they're trans, of course. And therefore they should be allowed in the boy's locker room. With adult male coaches. </p><p>Do you see the problem here?</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cMeet Kelly King, Asst. Superintendent in Glendale CA Unified. \\u201cWe have male coaches who are horrified at the thought of having a biological girl changing clothes in front of them\\u2026 It\\u2019s not a girl.

Yeah, the stigma attached to, you know, abuse, and you know, having a male teacher around any female student, in that circumstance is just scary for them.\"</em></p><p>I don't think it's actually a \"stigma\" attached to grown men watching young women change at school. I think it's just, y'know, the \"law.\" </p><p><em>\"It's one thing for me to keep saying \"it's not a girl! It's not a girl! It's not a girl! You only have boys in the boys locker room!\" Until they arrive... until they experience it and realize, \"Oh, I only have boys in the locker room.\" Then that helps.\"</em></p><p>So essentially, she gaslights these poor dudes into believing that the female students they must watch change are actually boys. Because they say they're boys. My guess is these coaches probably believe it because they want to. Telling themselves they only have boys in their locker rooms might help them cope with an extremely uncomfortable situation. </p><p>So California parents, beware! And leave California, if you're able to. Preferably <em>before</em> the next surprise blizzard. </p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Lily is a Zoomer college dropout who somehow landed a writing gig here at LwC.com.
